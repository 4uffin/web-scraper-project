# Web Crawler Project

An automated web crawling system that discovers URLs from target websites and extracts their plain text content using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
- **URL Discovery**: Automatically finds new URLs from configured target websites
- **Web Crawling**: Extracts plain text content from discovered URLs and saves them locally

Both processes run automatically on a schedule using GitHub Actions, with the ability to trigger them manually.

## Features

- üîÑ **Automated URL Discovery**: Scans target websites for new links matching specified prefixes
- üìÑ **Plain Text Extraction**: Converts HTML content to clean, readable plain text
- üöÄ **GitHub Actions Integration**: Runs automatically every hour with manual trigger support
- üìÅ **Change Detection**: Only saves content when changes are detected to minimize commits
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Continues operation even if individual URLs fail
- üîß **Configurable Targets**: Easy to add new websites to crawl

## How It Works

### URL Discovery Process
1. Scans configured target websites (currently Wikipedia and kernel.org)
2. Extracts links that match specified URL prefixes
3. Adds new, unique URLs to `urls.txt`
4. Commits changes if new URLs are found

### Web Crawling Process
1. Reads URLs from `urls.txt`
2. Fetches each URL and extracts plain text content
3. Saves content to individual `.txt` files in `crawled_output/`
4. Only saves files when content has changed
5. Commits changes if any files were updated

## Configuration

### Adding New Target Websites

Edit the `TARGET_SITES` dictionary in `find_urls.py`:

```python
TARGET_SITES = {
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/",
    "https://kernel.org/": "https://www.kernel.org/category/",
    "https://example.com/": "https://example.com/section/"  # Add new sites here
}
```

### Schedule Configuration

Both workflows run hourly by default. To change the schedule, modify the ```cron``` expression in the workflow files:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies locally (optional)**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure target websites** (optional)
   - Edit `TARGET_SITES` in `find_urls.py` to add new websites

4. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Ensure Actions are enabled in your repository settings
   - The workflows will start running automatically

## Manual Execution

### Run URL Discovery
```bash
python find_urls.py
```

### Run Web Crawling
```bash
python crawl.py
```

### Trigger GitHub Actions Manually
1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select either "Find New URLs" or "Web Crawler"
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Dependencies

- `requests`: HTTP library for fetching web pages
- `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing library for extracting content and links

## GitHub Actions Permissions

Both workflows require the following permissions:
- `contents: write` - To commit and push changes to the repository

## Output

- **URLs**: New discovered URLs are appended to `urls.txt`
- **Content**: Plain text content is saved as `.txt` files in `crawled_output/`
- **Commits**: Automated commits are made when changes are detected

## Error Handling

- Individual URL failures don't stop the entire process
- Network timeouts are handled gracefully
- Invalid URLs are skipped with error messages
- Workflows use `continue-on-error: true` to maintain robustness

## Current Target Sites

- **Wikipedia**: Discovers article pages from the main page
- **Kernel.org**: Finds category pages and documentation

## Notes

- The crawler respects basic web etiquette with User-Agent headers
- Content is cleaned to remove scripts, styles, and excessive whitespace
- Only commits changes when new content is found to keep the repository clean
- All URLs and content are stored as plain text for easy version control

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your target websites to `TARGET_SITES`
3. Test the changes locally
4. Submit a pull request
