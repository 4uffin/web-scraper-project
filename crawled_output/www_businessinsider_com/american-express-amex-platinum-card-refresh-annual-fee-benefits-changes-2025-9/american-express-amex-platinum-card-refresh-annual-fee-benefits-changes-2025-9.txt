Amex's new Platinum card now costs $895.
Cardholders will get upgraded dining, hotel, and wellness perks, as well as an updated app.
The refresh takes the luxury credit card wars to a new, pricier level.
For $895, you could get a month of rent in a midsize American city, a new iPhone 17 and a case, or the refreshed American Express Platinum card.
Amex unveiled its revamped Platinum card on Thursday, which offers expanded benefits in categories like dining, hotels, and wellness. A $200 fee hike will also go into effect at the next renewal date for existing consumer cardholders on or after January 2, 2026, and on or after December 2, 2025, for business cardholders.The new Platinum card offers $3,500 worth of annual benefits, according to a press release.
Anthony Cirri, Amex's executive vice president of US consumer cards, told Business Insider ahead of the release that they designed new benefits based on consumer spending data and feedback. Platinum Business cardholders get their own suite of benefits, including credits with Dell and Adobe."It's about the price value, and I think we got that right," Cirri said, adding that he doesn't anticipate pushback to the new fee.With this Platinum refresh, Amex Platinum surpasses the cost of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, with its $795 annual fee.
The amount Americans pay in credit card fees has ballooned in recent years, going from $3.0 billion in 2015 to $6.4 billion in 2022, according to a 2023 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Amex cited "continued strong card fee growth" and "strong" demand for its premium products in its second-quarter earnings.Cirri said Amex didn't change its plans for Platinum after Chase announced its updates in June, adding that the revamped card has been in the works for around 18 months. The card has itself become a status symbol, and a limited-edition mirror design will be available for six months, or until supplies last."Cardmembers take pride in membership. They take pride in their physical card," Cirri said. Here are the new perks $895 will get consumer cardholders, in addition to the existing benefits.
The mirror design will be available for six months, or as long as supplies last.
