Business Insider asked two stylists which items to remove from your wardrobe this fall.
Distressed denim and cargo joggers are falling out of favor as refined looks take their place.
Clothes with cut-outs and shoes with chunky lug soles may also be losing their appeal.
As the leaves change, so do the trends. Fall brings new layers, richer textures, and fresh takes on the season's staples. However, what worked last year might not be what's in style now.
Business Insider consulted with two professional stylists to find out which attire to retire from our closets this fall — and what we should wear instead.
Swap out your cropped puffer out for an aviator jacket.

Cropped puffers fit into the quiet luxury trend, but fall 2025 outerwear is shifting in both style and volume, said David Zyla, stylist and author of "Color Your Style."He said more maximal styles, like leather aviator jackets, are taking their place."An iconic staple in menswear originally designed for military pilots, this pairs especially well with other vintage-inspired pieces such as a slip skirt or Mary Jane shoes," the stylist told BI.
Blanket scarves are being replaced by "scarf coats."

This season, designers are attaching scarf-like panels directly onto coats, which creates built-in drama without adding extra layers. There's no reason to add a blanket scarf to your outfit if you can buy outerwear that already has one built in. Plus, these so-called "scarf coats" are on trend, said Zyla. "Pair scarf coats with one of the season's must-have boots, such as a moto, riding, or harness-style, and consider cinching the waist with a belt or oversized belt bag," Zyla said.
Consider retiring your shredded jeans.
Ripped denim isn't the "it" style of the season.

Once edgy, overly ripped denim now feels more worn-out than fashion-forward."With people moving between multiple events and occasions in a single day, denim needs to flex across contexts," Natalie Tincher, the principal stylist and founder of BU Style, told BI. "Overly ripped jeans simply don't offer that versatility and can look dated."As cleaner, more intentional silhouettes take center stage this fall, the stylist recommends a barrel, wide-leg, or straight-leg denim in dark or medium washes as a replacement."The key is choosing denim that can be mixed and matched to fit different settings and moods, while working seamlessly with the pieces you already own," she said.
Tiny bags are out, and bigger purses are in.
Small bags aren't always practical.

As Zyla mentioned, maximal styles are trending this season. To balance those outfits,
handbag trends have also shifted in scale — micro purses ones are out, bigger ones are in. Fortunately, larger bags are practical enough to carry everything you need without sacrificing style.The stylist recommends an oversized quilted or suede handbag. The textures can pair especially well with fall outerwear, from the sleek canvas of a cropped trench to the plush finish of a faux-mink coat.
Say goodbye to low-rise skinny jeans.
Low-rise pants aren't always the best option.

If you're going to wear skinny jeans, you may want to stick with mid- or high-rise styles.Zyla told BI that tight, lower-rise jeans can feel overly constrictive, especially as more relaxed silhouettes are becoming popular. In fact, you may even want to opt for looser, flared denim. If you're not sure where to start, Zyla suggested trying darker washes, such as an inky indigo, which can be easy to style.
Try replacing lug-sole loafers with boat shoes.

Chunky, lug-sole loafers had their moment. And as large sunglasses and big bags become popular, these thick-soled shoes might just compete with those other statement accessories. Instead, Zyla said, give boat shoes a try this season. Long tied to preppy style, they pair well with plaid trousers and polo sweaters. Plus, they tend to be a fairly comfortable walking shoe.
Cozy cargo joggers are giving way to more polished styles.

"Cargo joggers were the perfect mix of cozy and functional when we were living in athleisure and working from the couch, but as wardrobes shift back into pieces that can handle a full day — work, errands, dinner — they fall short," Tincher told BI.Instead, she suggests wide-leg or barrel-leg pants, which feel fresh, work across genders, and can easily be dressed up or down.
Clothes and accessories with lots of logos may not be the chicest options.
Consider wearing logos in a subtle way.

According to Tincher, looks with large logos (or lots of them) are falling out of style. It's easy for excessive branding to feel more like advertising than self-expression.Instead, she recommends making your own signature "logo" through style. This could be frequently wearing a color you love that people can associate with you, sticking to a go-to accessory, or styling a particular sihloutte over and over."The repetition of those personal choices becomes your identifier — far more memorable than any monogram," she added.
Cropped cardigans may be replacing baggier, oversized ones.

Oversized cardigans worked well with skinny jeans as the proportions balance each other out. However, wider trousers are now trending — and pairing them with an oversized top can result in a sloppy look.To balance an outfit with looser pants, Tincher suggests trying cropped or waist-length knits instead."They hit higher on the body, creating balance with wide-leg bottoms and giving shape back to your frame," she told BI. "Think of it as a natural silhouette progression: As pants got wider, knits got shorter."
Clothing with dramatic cut-outs isn't always versatile.
More subtle cut-outs might be easier to style than more distinct ones.

Those bold midriff or side cut-outs might work for a special night out, but they're tricky to sport in other settings, Tincher said. Instead of dramatic cut-outs, the stylist recommends pieces that use transparency in subtle, intentional ways."A fine-knit sweater with lace-trimmed shoulders or cuffs adds just enough intrigue without crossing into 'too much for the office,'" she said.
