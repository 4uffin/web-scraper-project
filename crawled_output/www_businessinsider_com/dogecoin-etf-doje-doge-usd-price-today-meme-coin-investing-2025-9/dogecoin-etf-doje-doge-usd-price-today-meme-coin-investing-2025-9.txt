The first dogecoin ETF started trading on Thursday.
The meme token was a posterchild of the pandemic trading frenzy.
It's up about 5% on Thursday, but down 10% in 2025 and down 60% since it peaked in 2021.
The original meme coin is coming at you in ETF form.
Dogecoin, a poster child of the pandemic trading frenzy and one of the first-ever meme tokens to go mainstream, now has its own exchange-traded fund.DOJE, a fund tracking the shiba-inu themed toke, was launched on Thursday by REX-Osprey, a partnership between ETF provider REX Financial and crypto firm Osprey Funds. The fund marks the first-ever ETF to offer direct exposure to Dogecoin, REX-Osprey said.
Investing in DOJE isn't the same as investing in dogecoin itself, but the fund looks like it could track the Elon Musk-endorsed meme coin pretty closely, with 60% of its existing funds currently invested in the token itself and 38% invested in 21Shares' Dogecoin ETP."Investors look to ETFs as trading and access vehicles. The digital asset revolution is already underway," Greg King, the CEO of REX Financial and Osprey, said in a statement.It's been a volatile year for Dogecoin despite a broader rally that has steadily lifted the crypto market. The meme coin was up 5% in Thursday afternoon trading, but it's down 10% year-to-date.
Bitcoin, by comparison, is up 29% in 2025. Dogecoin is down more than 60% from its all-time high in 2021, when it reached $0.73. Its popularity hit pitch-fever at the height of the pandemic, partly due to backing from Elon Musk, who often posted about the meme coin. Crypto ETFs, meanwhile, have been growing increasingly popula after spot bitcoin funds took off in early 2024. Assets under management among bitcoin ETFs have climbed to $151 billion, while assets in ethereum ETFs have swelled to $24 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
