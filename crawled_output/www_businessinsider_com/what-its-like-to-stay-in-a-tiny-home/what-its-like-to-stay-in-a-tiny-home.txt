I stayed in a tiny home that I found on Airbnb for two nights, and now I want to live in one full-time.
I'd never stayed in a tiny home before and thought I'd feel limited in a 250-square-foot house.
The home's impressive space-saving hacks and lush outdoor area won me over.
"Hopefully it looks smaller on the outside than it feels on the inside," I thought as I walked up to the front door of my home for the next two nights.In 2021, I took a trip to Miami and stayed in a 250-square-foot tiny home I found on Airbnb for about $100 a night.
It was my first time staying in one, and I figured I'd find the space uncomfortably small for more than a couple of nights. But the tiny house packed in a queen-sized bed, a kitchen, a bathroom, decor, and storage space, all without feeling cramped.I also thought tiny homes were just for minimalists. However, this one's liberal use of color, unique storage spaces, and mixed-media wall decor made it feel inviting without seeming cluttered.
I never thought I'd say this — but now I can picture myself living tiny.

Located in the lush backyard of a full-sized home, my Airbnb was hidden underneath 100-year-old oak trees, according to the listing.When I arrived, I pictured myself working among the array of plants and thought this outdoor space made the tiny home seem livable.
To the right of the front door, the bedroom had a queen-sized mattress and frame.

I was surprised to find a queen bed in such a small space. But it made me realize I wouldn't have to get a smaller mattress to live in a tiny home — as long as I was smart about using the remaining space.
There was a table next to the bedroom, and I thought it was clever of the owners to put crates on the walls for more storage space.

The table also doubled as storage shelving. I stored my belongings here to feel more at home during my stay.
The kitchen had a fridge, toaster oven, full-sized sink, and counter space to the left.

A sliding barn door led to the bathroom past the kitchen, which I thought was a clever way to save the space a swinging door would take up.
The bathroom had more storage and decor all over the walls.

Next to the shower, a storage closet had a curtain rather than a door, which I thought looked better while saving more space.
After a meal and a shower, I relaxed on the bed and thought, "Yeah, I could live somewhere like this."

In the morning, my feelings were confirmed when I saw all the natural light through the windows.
