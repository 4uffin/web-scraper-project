When I moved to London, I landed my dream job at the BBC.
On the first day of my job, I knew it wasn't for me, sending me into a career and identity spiral.
Leaving the BBC was the start of my career pivot into online business.
Two months after moving to London, I received the offer I had always dreamed about: I would work in news publicity at the BBC.
I couldn't believe my fortune. It was one of those "pinch me" moments that made all the sacrifices, visa paperwork, and career risks feel worth it.I had grown up watching the network from across the globe and imagined what it would be like to walk the halls of such a prestigious institution. My vision board had the BBC logo front and center.
On my first day, I walked into that historic building with a mix of excitement and nerves. Everyone was lovely. The team was smart and collaborative. The office was buzzing with creativity. I got my BBC lanyard, which I wore with excessive pride, and updated my LinkedIn profile. And yet, something felt off.I eventually learned that my dream job could evolve as I grow.My job at the BBC just didn't feel rightI couldn't explain it. I walked out of that building feeling despondent. It wasn't nerves. It wasn't imposter syndrome. I'd worked hard for this moment. But something in me whispered: "This isn't it."
I bought myself a burrito and a cheap bottle of wine and sat on my couch in my tiny London flat.Instead of celebrating, I stared at the wall, wondering: "What's wrong with me? What have I done?"The job itself was still good: challenging and exciting. It came with prestige and opportunities I never imagined. I met prime ministers. I met the Backstreet Boys, which my teenage self was ecstatic about. I got to work on campaigns that made global headlines.
But after a few months, that "not right" feeling didn't go away. It grew louder.True success isn't about a title or organizationI had gotten everything I thought I wanted. But somewhere along the way, what I actually wanted had changed. My values were shifting. I still loved storytelling, communications, and the media — but I was beginning to dream of something different.

The thing is, there was no way I would leave the BBC. It felt like such a key part of my identity, who I wanted to be, the type of people I wanted to be around. How could I let this go after working so hard to get to this moment?
Still, I started exploring the world of online business by listening to business podcasts on my lunch breaks.I slowly built a coaching and PR business side hustle. One client turned into two, and then a workshop here and a speaking gig there. I wasn't entirely sure where it would all lead, but for the first time in a long time, I felt aligned.That sense of dread I couldn't explain on my first day? It was the earliest whisper of intuition, telling me a new chapter was coming.
One year later, life intervened, and due to visa issues, my hand was forced, and I had to leave the BBC. I left the job, the brand, and the dream I had once clung to. It was terrifying and liberating at the same time.When everything stops, something new starts to emergeYears later, I've built a business helping entrepreneurs and emerging leaders get media coverage without needing a huge budget or a PR agency.I teach them what I had to learn the hard way — how to publicize themselves with confidence, clarity, and authenticity.
If I could offer any advice to someone feeling the same quiet discomfort I once did, it's this: Your version of success will evolve. And that's not failure; that's alignment.Just because something was your dream five years ago doesn't mean it still fits. It's OK to change. It's OK to outgrow the vision you once had. That's not quitting — that's honoring your growth.Sometimes the dream job isn't the end of the story. It's just the beginning of a new one.
