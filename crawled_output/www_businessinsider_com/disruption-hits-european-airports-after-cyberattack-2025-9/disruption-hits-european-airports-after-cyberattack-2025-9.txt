European airports are warning of delays and cancellations following a "cyberattack."
Brussels Airport said an attack had targeted a service provider for check-in and boarding systems.
London's Heathrow Airport and Berlin Brandenburg Airport have also reported issues.
Several major European airports are warning of delays and cancellations on Saturday following a "cyberattack."
Brussels Airport said in an update on its website that an attack on Friday night had targeted a service provider for check-in and boarding systems, "affecting several European airports."In a post on X, London's Heathrow Airport warned of delays for departing passengers due to a "technical issue" affecting Collins Aerospace, which provides check-in and boarding systems for a number of airlines around the world.
Collins Aerospace's parent company, RTX, said it had "become aware of a cyber-related disruption" to its "MUSE" software in select airports."The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations," it said. "We are actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible."Berlin Brandenburg Airport has also reported longer waiting times at check-in due to a "technical issue at a system provider."
