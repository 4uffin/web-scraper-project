A new $100,000 annual fee is set to be required, affecting workers across tech and finance.

Some Tesla workers, for instance, received a memo this weekend asking employees on H-1Bs to stay in the country or come back before the order went into effect on Sunday.Business Insider has reviewed memos sent to staff at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Goldman Sachs about the changes. Read them below.

AmazonH-1B Executive Order, Sep 19, 2025Amazonians,We've reviewed the Presidential Proclamation on H-1B visas that was released today and are actively working to gain greater clarity. Here's what you need to know right now: The proclamation creates a travel restriction starting September 21, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT (9:01 p.m. PDT tomorrow). After this deadline, individuals cannot enter the U.S. on H-1B status without an additional $100,000 payment associated with their petition. Recommended actions for you to take:
If you have H-1B status and are in the U.S.: Stay in the country for now, even if you have travel planned for the immediate future. We will continue to provide updates as more details are available.If you have H-4 dependent status: We also recommend you remain in the U.S., though the proclamation doesn't specifically mention H-4 dependents.If you have H-1B or H-4 status and are outside the U.S.: Try to return before tomorrow's deadline if possible. We realize this is short notice but returning soon is advisable and you should make every effort possible to clear U.S. customs before 12:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 p.m. PDT) on Sunday, September 21, 2025.
At this time, if you have an H-1B or H-4 status and are unable to return before the deadline, we advise that you do not attempt to enter the U.S. until further guidance is provided.MicrosoftIMPORTANT ADVISORY: New travel restriction for H-1B visa holders

(Updated at 6:04 pm pacific with the intake form for those outside of the U.S.)
Hi all--We have now reviewed the actual text of today's Presidential Proclamation on H-1B visas, which you can find here: Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers — The White House.Here's what you need to know:First, the proclamation is structured as a travel restriction. Beginning at 12:01 am eastern time on September 21, 2025 (so, 9:01 pm Pacific time tomorrow), individuals will not be able to enter/return to the U.S. in H-1B status unless their petition has an additional $100,000 payment associated with it.
What you need to do:If you are in H-1B status and are in the U.S., you should remain in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. We know this may interrupt your travel plans. But the critical thing is to stay in the U.S. in order to avoid being denied reentry.While the proclamation doesn't reference H-4 dependents, we also recommend that H-4s remain in the U.S.
If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours.We will also be reaching out to everyone by email later today to make sure everyone is aware.The proclamation does not impact any other visa statuses. (Note, we have started receiving emails from people in other statuses like L-1 and TN asking about impacts. I'll reiterate that this does not impact people in other statuses. If you refrain from sending in questions asking about that, it will help us divert our resources to help those who are impacted. Thanks!)
There is other content in the proclamation about the pause in processing H-1B petitions for individuals who are outside the U.S. At this time, we do not interpret this to immediately impact extensions of H-1B status or changes of status to H-1B as long as you are currently in the U.S. We'll share more about that later.I know these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you. While we don't have all of the answers right now, we ask that you prioritize the recommendations above.GoogleWe are reaching out with an urgent update regarding international travel for individuals on H-1B visas.
A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the U.S.What You Need to Know:If you are currently outside the U.S.:If you are currently outside the U.S. with a valid H-1B visa, make plans to return and enter the U.S. before the Proclamation takes effect on Sunday, September 21 at 12:01 am ET (i.e. by this Saturday night).If you are currently in the U.S.:We strongly advise against any international travel if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the U.S.
Departing the U.S. may result in complications or denial of re-entry under the new policy.If you are unable to return prior to the deadline in H-1B status: please reach out to go/immigration-help.We understand this may create challenges, and we are here to support you. We are actively monitoring the situation and will keep you updated as we learn more.
Goldman SachsGuidance for Our People Who Have H-1B VisasWith the announcement of the Executive Order signed yesterday focused on certain H-1B visas, we understand that our colleagues who are visa holders have questions about the scope of the order and its impact.
