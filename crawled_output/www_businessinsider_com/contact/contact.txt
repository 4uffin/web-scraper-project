Send a tip
As an independent news organization, Business Insider depends on sources to investigate important institutions. While
we look for our sources to speak on the record, sources may sometimes rely on us to protect their identities
where they fear negative repercussions for speaking out.
Learn how to securely send Business Insider news tips.
Story corrections
Business Insider has a policy of correcting factual errors quickly and transparently.
In certain circumstances, we also add to stories after
they are published when relevant new information emerges. If you believe we have published something that is
factually wrong, or otherwise unfair, please email us at corrections@businessinsider.com.
Write "Correction request" in the subject line. In the body of the email, include a link to the story you
are concerned about. Give as much supporting evidence as you can for your correction request, so that we can
quickly adjust stories if need be.
