I landed a job at Goldman Sachs right out of college thanks to my résumé.
My revamped résumé focused more on my mission as a person rather than my achievements.
I think the best résumés and cover letters focus on a person's "why."
At 21, I was in my Georgetown dorm room trying to land an investment banking or consulting job.
I had limited business experience, and I was an international politics major. My résumé was forgettable. Not surprisingly, I didn't hear back from most firms.So I hired a résumé consultant to help me tell my story. There were so many unspoken rules of résumé writing, and I didn't know how to convey my experience in a way that would attract employers. The consultant helped me to stop writing as if I were asking for approval and to start writing like I had something to offer. In the new draft, we focused on results, cut the fluff, and added my voice.
That résumé helped me land a job at Goldman Sachs right out of college.More than a decade later, I've reviewed hundreds of résumés through my work as founder of Venture for Canada, a nonprofit that supports young entrepreneurs. The best résumés are not perfect. They are personal, show judgment, energy, and intent.Here are the five résumé rules I swear by to help you tell your story to employers.
1. Clarify your values by reflecting on peak experiencesOnce I identified that I value helping people take meaningful risks, this shaped how I think and talk about my work.To identify your values, think of three moments when you felt proud, energized, or fulfilled. What do they have in common? Those are your values.Your résumé and cover letter will stand out if they show what matters to you — not just what you've done.
2. Define a personal mission, even if you find it laterYou do not need everything figured out when you apply. I didn't. Before 2020, I was guided by an unspoken mission, something like "create things that make a difference." It was vague but directional.It helped me make choices that felt aligned, even if I could not articulate why at the time. Eventually, I landed on a sentence that stuck: "Help others reach their full potential." That line clarified why I studied politics and launched a nonprofit.

If you are not sure where to start, look at three decisions you are proud of. What do they have in common? That pattern often reveals your mission in disguise. You do not need the perfect words; you just need a working compass.
Even if you do not include it in your letter, it will help you write a story that feels cohesive to the reader and yourself.3. Write multiple drafts, read them out loud, and test themIn my book "The Uncertainty Advantage," I describe career growth as a loop: reflect, act, adjust. Writing a cover letter or résumé is no different.Try a few versions, read them aloud, and ask yourself, "Does this sound like me?" Better yet, ask someone else. "Would you call this person in for an interview?" If they say, "It's solid," rewrite it.
You want to hear, "This sounds exactly like you."4. Get feedback from people who won't hold backEarly in my career, mentors read my drafts and told me, "You're hiding." They were right. I was trying to sound impressive instead of being honest.Don't ask 10 acquaintances for feedback. Instead, ask one or two people who know how you speak and will push you to be more direct and specific. Think of someone you've worked with whom you trust and especially value their judgment.
5. Let your story evolveI can't tell you how many iterations of my story I have shared throughout my career. When I started Venture for Canada, I thought entrepreneurship was about building companies. Over time, I realized it's about building people. That shift changed how I lead, hire, and communicate.Your goals will likely also change, and your story will evolve; this is a sign of growth. Instead of overthinking things, focus on sharing your story right now.
