I booked a 225-square-foot sea terrace room on an adults-only Virgin Voyages cruise.
Starting at $844 a night, the room had a balcony and a queen-sized bed that transforms into a couch.
It felt luxurious with a rainfall shower and smart controls for mood lighting and entertainment.
My home for seven days of cruising the Mediterranean Sea felt larger than I anticipated.When I booked the 225-square-foot sea terrace room with the adults-only cruise line Virgin Voyages in 2023, I expected to feel cramped in the tiny space, especially since I was traveling with someone else. I was happy to be wrong.
My cabin on Virgin Voyages' Valiant Lady ship had a starting rate of $5,910 for a weeklong stay for two people. Business Insider paid a media rate for the cruise.The cruise sailed round-trip from Barcelona to ports in Italy and France. And my room was so lavish that I spent more time inside than expected. Here's a look at every detail that made it worth the price.
Virgin Voyages' Valiant Lady ship has 1,408 cabins and suites. My room was toward the back of deck 12.
The back of the ship docked in Marina di Carrara.

I booked a third-tier stateroom with a balcony — a step above sea-view cabins, which have only a window, and two steps above an interior room with no view.
The room was 225 square feet, including the balcony. I thought the cabin efficiently used the tiny space while including luxury details.

Inside was a queen-size bed, a desk, a bathroom, and plenty of hidden storage compartments. Considering the room's small size, I was surprised by the ample floor space. I never felt cramped in my cabin.
At the front of the cabin, the bathroom was stocked with toiletries and storage spaces to keep the counter clutter-free.
The bathroom had clever storage, toiletries, and a rainfall shower head.

The bathroom felt luxurious thanks to a rainfall shower head.
Across from the bathroom, a clever curtain hid the closet.

Inside, I spotted a shelf with two empty bins for extra storage and a cabinet holding emergency life vests, towels, a safe, and drawers I filled with clothing.
Next to the closet, the desk against the wall had an ottoman tucked underneath it. I thought this made the room feel bigger.

Beneath the desk, I spotted a hidden mini fridge, which I used to keep my drinks cold.
At the back of the room, there was a comfortable queen-size bed. Next to it, a thin nightstand was light enough to move around the room as needed.

I learned from the Virgin Voyages app that crew members could transform the bed into a couch upon request. This made the cabin feel more like a living room during the day.
The cabin also had an in-room tablet with entertainment and smart controls.

I didn't have to leave my bed to change the lighting or close the curtains.From "hangover" to "photo shoot," different settings on the tablet changed the mood lighting around the room.
The best part of the cabin was the balcony. It had a table, chairs, and a large, netted hammock.

I spent a lot of time on my balcony during the voyage. With the fresh air and sunset views, I thought it was totally worth the upgrade for a private outdoor space.
With multipurpose furniture and plenty of storage, I thought the 225-square-foot room was big enough to keep my travel buddy and me comfortable.

Joey Hadden/Business Insider
I'd definitely book a sea terrace cabin with Virgin Voyages again. And I'd recommend it to adult travelers who want to feel wrapped in luxury at sea.
