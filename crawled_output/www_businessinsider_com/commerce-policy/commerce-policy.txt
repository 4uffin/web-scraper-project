Commerce Policy
Last updated: June 4, 2024
Business Insider publishes links to various retailers as part of our reporting, particularly within product reviews through our Commerce team, which includes Business Insider Coupons, Business Insider Reviews, and Personal Finance Insider.
Business Insider Coupons publishes the best deals and coupon codes from hundreds of online retailers. It is produced and maintained in close partnership with Global Savings Group. Insider Inc. may earn a commission when a purchase is made via Business Insider Coupons.
Business Insider Reviews aims to highlight products and services you might find interesting, and if you buy them, we get a small share of the revenue from the sale from our commerce partners. We frequently receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test. This does not drive our decision as to whether or not a product is featured or recommended.
We only earn revenue when readers purchase and keep the products we recommend. If someone returns a product, we lose money.
The Personal Finance Insider team highlights financial products and services that can help you make smarter decisions with your money. We do not give investment advice or encourage you to adopt a certain investment strategy. What you decide to do with your money is up to you. If you take action based on one of our recommendations, we get a small share of the revenue from our commerce partners. This does not influence whether we feature a financial product or service.
A list of current Personal Finance advertising partners can be found here.
The Commerce team operates independently from our advertising sales team. We welcome your feedback.
