See our Privacy Policy for more information about contacting Business Insider if you believe we have collected information from a child under 13.
Business Insider allows minors under the age of 18 years old to access, or become Registered Users of, the Sites.

If you do not properly notify us, authenticate your status as a Registered User, or properly identify the particular User Contribution to be removed, Business Insider is not required to remove your User Contribution and removal will be in our sole discretion.
Removal of User Contributions from the Sites does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of your User Contributions from the Sites. Business Insider, in our sole discretion, may retain your User Contributions on our servers in some form. However, removal will render your User Contribution invisible to other users of the Sites. We may, in our sole discretion, decide to anonymize your User Contribution such that you cannot be individually identified, rather than remove the User Contribution.

17.	DISPUTE RESOLUTION
a. Informal Dispute Resolution. If a dispute arises between you and Business Insider with respect to your use of the Sites and/or any online products or services owned, controlled or offered by Business Insider that post a link to and are governed by these Terms of Service (collectively, the "Services"), both parties agree that they will first, as a prerequisite to any litigation or arbitration, make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute informally for 60 days after the responding party's receipt of a written description of the dispute from the claimant party. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide your name, a description of the nature and basis of the claim, and the specific relief sought. Any relevant limitations period, filing fees, or other deadlines will be tolled during the 60 days. This provision applies to all users of the Services, regardless of whether the users are Registered Users.
b. Class-Action Waiver:
If your dispute is not subject to the Arbitration Agreement (defined in Section 17(c) below) and if, after having fully complied with the Informal Dispute Resolution process (described in Section 17(a) above), your dispute is still not resolved, you agree to waive your right to bring or participate in a class action or other representative proceeding with respect to your dispute.
c. Arbitration Agreement.
(i) If you are a Registered User and the informal dispute resolution process described in Section 17(a) above does not resolve all claims and disputes that in any way relate to a dispute with Business Insider pursuant to, or that may arise out of the interpretation, applicability, performance, or enforcement of, these Terms of Service (including this section 17) (collectively, “Claims”), you and Business Insider agree that the Claims shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration according to this section 17 (the "Arbitration Agreement"). "Claims" includes any (A) claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement and/or arising after its termination pursuant to 17(h) and 17(i) below, (B) claims arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and this Arbitration Agreement, or that all or any part thereof are void or voidable or whether the claim is subject to arbitration, and (C) disputes regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including payment timing and nonpayment remedies). This Arbitration Agreement is exclusively governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Except as otherwise set forth in this clause 17(c), the arbitrator or arbitration body shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes.
(ii) The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. Notwithstanding this clause 17(c), each party retains the right to (A) elect to have applicable claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis; (B) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (meaning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (C) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party's Claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.
(iii) You and Business Insider submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York, New York in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
(iv) Except as set forth in clause 17(d) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid, the parties agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in that provision, and that the other provisions hereof remain in full force and effect.
(v) THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE CLAIMS, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
d. Class Arbitration & Collective Relief Waiver. YOU AND BUSINESS INSIDER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS CLAUSE 17(d) AND CLAUSE 17(f) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY'S CLAIM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THOUGH IT MAY DO SO ONLY IF BUSINESS INSIDER CONSENTS TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.
e. Arbitration Rules, Initiation, Location & Procedure. If available, the arbitration will be administered by the National Arbitration and Mediation ("NAM") and resolved before a single arbitrator. In no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Except as modified by this section 17, NAM will administer the arbitration according to applicable NAM rules and procedures available at www.namadr.com or by emailing NAM's Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@businessinsider.com. If Business Insider is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Business Insider account. Subject to NAM rules and procedures, the arbitrator will have discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Business Insider (and each party's authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed to the extent permitted by law.
f. Batch Arbitration. If 100 or more similar arbitration demands (asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another non-AAA arbitration provider selected if NAM is unavailable) against Business Insider within reasonably close proximity ("Mass Filing"), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (a final batch may consist of the remaining demands if less than 100) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined in the arbitrator's discretion; (iv) that no other arbitration demands that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Business Insider and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible according to applicable NAM rules and procedures, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Business Insider and the arbitration provider to implement such a "batch approach" or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This "Batch Arbitration" provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Business Insider otherwise consents in writing, Business Insider does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in clause 13(d) above and this clause 13(f). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.
g. Arbitrator's Decision, Fees. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with clause 13(d) above and also must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section 16 above as damages or other relief for which Business Insider may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will be preclusive of issues or claims in any dispute with persons not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys' fees will be available to the prevailing party only if authorized under the substantive law governing the claims. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions according to NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines were not filed in good faith, and for a party's failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure in clause 17(a). You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.
h. Right to Opt-Out of the Arbitration Agreement. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE "ARBITRATION AGREEMENT" SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 17, THEN: (i) within 30 days of the date that you first purchase any Services, or otherwise become subject to this Arbitration Agreement, you must notify Business Insider in writing by mail sent to Business Insider at One Liberty Plaza, New York, NY 10006, Attn: Legal Department, or by email to arb-opt-out@businessinsider.com; and (ii) your written notification must include (A) your name and address, (B) the date you first purchased the Services, if applicable, and (C) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.
i. Changes. Business Insider will provide notice of any material changes to this section 17 by posting notice on the Sites or otherwise as legally required.
