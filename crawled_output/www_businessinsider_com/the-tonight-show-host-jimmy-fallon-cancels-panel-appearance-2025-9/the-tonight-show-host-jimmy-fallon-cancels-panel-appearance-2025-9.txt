Jimmy Fallon canceled his planned appearance at Fast Company's panel about his new reality series.
Fallon was set to discuss his marketing competition series "On Brand."
The last-minute cancellation comes amid late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's recent controversy.
Jimmy Fallon canceled his planned appearance at a business conference on Thursday.
The "Tonight Show" host was set to appear at Fast Company's Innovation Festival on Thursday morning to discuss his coming NBC reality series, "On Brand." However, the publication told attendees Thursday that Fallon would no longer be joining moderator Jeff Beer for the panel."In light of recent events, Jimmy couldn't be here," a spokesperson for Fast Company said to Business Insider.
The cancellation comes as fellow late-night host, Jimmy Kimmel, has been benched from his own show "indefinitely" after comments on Charlie Kirk's death.
The Jimmy Kimmel fallout is ramping up. Get caught up here:Here's what Jimmy Kimmel said about Charlie Kirk on his late-night show that got him pulled off the airThere's a $6.2 billion deal looming over Jimmy Kimmel's suspensionLate-night TV is under threat from Trump and a precarious business modelThese are the demands ABC-affiliate Sinclair is making to air Jimmy Kimmel againPeter Kafka: The Trump administration forcing Jimmy Kimmel off the air is bad. Very bad.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump praised ABC for pulling Kimmel off the air and urged NBC to do the same to its late-night hosts. He appeared to be referring to Fallon and Seth Meyers."That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Trump also mentioned Stephen Colbert, host of "The Late Show," whose show is being canceled. CBS said in July that the cancellation was "purely a financial decision."Representatives for Fallon and NBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.Bozoma Saint John, Netflix's former chief marketing officer, is appearing in the Fast Company session in Fallon's stead. She mentors contestants on the unscripted show, which follows a marketing firm that Fallon launched and its creatives.
