Mortgage refinance applications rose 58% last week, per data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Borrowing costs have dipped ahead of an expected rate cut from the Fed.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell 15 basis points to 6.35% last week, per Freddie Mac.
There's one group of Americans already benefiting from the Fed's coming rate cut decision: current homeowners.
Americans are jumping on the opportunity to refinance their home loans, with refinance applications rising 58% in the last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance applications were up 70% compared to levels during the same week last year.Demand was even stronger for those seeking adjustable-rate mortgages, where borrowing costs fluctuate and are tied to short-term interest rates in the economy. The share of refinancing activity tied to ARMS rose to 12.9% in the last week, the highest share recorded since 2008, the group said.
The surge in demand has largely been fueled by a sharp drop in home borrowing costs as the market anticipates the Fed to trim its target rate at its September policy meeting. That directly impacts short-term borrowing costs in the economy, but it's also influencing long-term rates as investors expect borrowing costs to ease over a longer time frame.The 10-year US Treasury eased to around 4.02% on Wednesday, down from its peak around 4.8% in early 2025. Mortgage rates are tied to the 10-year yield.Meanwhile, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped 15 basis points to around 6.35% in the last week, according to Freddie Mac data. That represented the largest weekly drop in a year, the mortgage finance firm said.
The 5/1-year adjustable mortgage rate, a borrowing plan where mortgage rates are fixed for the first five years and adjust each year afterwards, also cooled to 5.7% in the week ending September 5, the MBA said in a previous report.

Mortgage activity is on the rise broadly, with total applications up 9.2% in the week ending September 5."The downward rate movement spurred the strongest week of borrower demand since 2022, with both purchase and refinance applications moving higher," Joel Kan, the deputy chief economist at the MBA, wrote in a statement.
The surge in activity suggests a brightening outlook for the US housing market, which has been frozen in recent years, as high borrowing costs have sidelined both buyers and sellers.This week, the National Association of Home Builders said it believed the housing market could be approaching a turning point as rates drop ahead of the expected Fed decision.Bank of America, meanwhile, said it expected mortgage rates to drop to around 6.25% by the end of the year as the Fed resumes its easing cycle.
