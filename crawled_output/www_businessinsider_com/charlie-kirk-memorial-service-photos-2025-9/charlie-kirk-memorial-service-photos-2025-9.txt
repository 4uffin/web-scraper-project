Turning Point USA hosted a memorial service for Charlie Kirk on Sunday.

The two billionaires had not been seen publicly together since Musk's exit from DOGE.
Tens of thousands of mourners arrived in droves at State Farm Stadium in Arizona on Sunday to remember conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Elon Musk and President Donald Trump were among them.
The pair were seen briefly sitting next to each other, chatting, and shaking hands before Musk moved seats.The two billionaires were last seen together publicly on May 30 during a press conference in the Oval Office marking Musk's exit from the White House DOGE Office. Before that press conference, the two men had feuded publicly over Trump's "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," which Musk said would add to the federal deficit.Musk posted a photo of himself and the president together on X on Sunday with the words "For Charlie." Kirk had once said he believed Trump and Musk would eventually set aside their differences.
Trump and several members of his cabinet, including JD Vance, spoke at Kirk's memorial service, as did numerous other prominent conservative leaders. It took place in a packed 60,000-seat stadium. Many more mourners watched from outside.
