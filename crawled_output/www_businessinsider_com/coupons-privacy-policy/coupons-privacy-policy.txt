Welcome to our Coupons Privacy Policy
Privacy Policy updated August 6, 2020
This website is your online destination for products, recommendations, deals, and discounts. Here, you can find quick access to coupons, promo codes and other ways to save from some of the biggest retailers. When you shop or make a purchase through this site, we receive a commission for connecting you with the retailer.
This Privacy Policy (“the Policy”) describes the information we collect, how we use your information, and who we share it with. This is important, so please take the time to read this Policy.
This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the following website: https://coupons.businessinsider.com (“Website”).
The Policy does not apply to the other websites connected directly or indirectly with this Website, which may have their own privacy policies.
1. Who We Are
Global Savings Group (“GSG”) operates this Website in partnership with Business Insider in order to provide visitors to the Website (“Website Visitors”) like you access to coupons and promotions for products sold elsewhere online.
2. The Information We Collect
We receive both information that is directly provided to us, such as personal information you provide when you visit the Website, and information that is automatically collected from you, such as information collected from your browser or device.
2.1 Information You Provide to Us: We collect information you choose to provide to us. For example, you may choose to provide your name, email address, or other information when you contact us through the Website.
You may choose to sign up for our newsletter through the Website. Our newsletter informs you regularly about recent online saving opportunities for various product categories, such as fashion, travel, and/or electronics in connection with deals published on our Website. If you sign up for the newsletter, we may collect your email address at sign-up, as well as information about your interaction with the e-mail newsletter (e-mail opens and clicks) through tracking technology such as pixel tags and web-beacons, which are discussed in Section 4.5.
In addition, you may choose to sign up for our loyalty rewards program. If you sign up for our loyalty rewards program, we may collect your email address when you sign-up, in order to send you the reward.
2.2 Automatically Collected Technical Data: When you visit the Website, we automatically collect data about your use of the Website (“Automatically Collected Technical Data”), including: the pages on the Website you have accessed, the IP address you are using, the referrer-URL, the date and time of your visit, your browsing activity, the time, frequency, and duration of page interactions, search queries made, clicks on banners and links, the type of browser and version used to access the Website, whether you have Java and cookies enabled, the operating system used, the type of device you used, demographic information, language settings, geographic location, and other information about how you interacted with this Website.
To collect this technical data, we use cookies and similar technologies, which contain a unique identifier, consisting of a string, which enables websites to recognize devices used to access a website on each subsequent visit throughout its lifetime. These identifiers do not allow us to draw any conclusions as to your identity.
2.3 Information You Provide To Our Vendors: Our vendors help us improve your experience on the Website by providing services described in Section 4 of this Policy. As explained in Section 4, they may collect data in performing their services for us that they then may share with us.
3. How We Use and Share the Information
We may use and share the information we collect to operate the Website and run our business as described below:
3.1 To provide, customize, measure, and improve this Website;
We use the information we collect to provide, manage and improve the technical and functional aspects of the Website, to redesign the Website to be more user-friendly, and to optimize the selection of Website contents and functionalities. We also use the information we collect for internal business purposes such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, and research.
We do not combine Automatically Collected Technical Data with other data sources. The temporary storage of the IP address of Website Visitors is necessary for technical reasons and to ensure the security of our system, in particular relating to the recognition of misuse. We only retain such data for as long as it is necessary for the stated purposes. IP addresses will be deleted or masked after 14 days at the latest.
3.2 To process and record your redemption of promotional offers;
This Website is provided to you free of charge. We pay for this Website through commissions we receive based on your interaction with promotional offers. We use information about your visit to our Website, i.e. your decision to accept our promotional offers, for reporting purposes in order to bill and collect our commission from business partners.
3.3 To offer promotional sweepstakes;
When we offer promotional sweepstakes, we typically ask you for certain personal information in order for you to participate. This includes your name, surname, age, address, phone number, social media account, and/or email address. When you provide us this information, we will only use it to administer the sweepstakes—unless you have given your explicit consent to use such data for another purpose.
3.4 To provide you loyalty reward benefits;
3.5 To provide you with our newsletter, personalize your newsletter communications, compile reports on newsletter activities and provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of the newsletter;
3.6 To respond to your inquiries;
3.7 To protect the safety of Website Visitors;
3.8 To fulfill contractual obligations in the event a merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company, or to provide such information in negotiations to create such contractual obligations;
3.9 To enforce our policies and Terms of Service; and
3.10 To provide you with personalized content;
We may also use this information to tailor to your interests the content and promotional offers we may display on this Website or otherwise send to you. For this purpose, we create pseudonymised usage profiles. These usage profiles help us to better understand your needs and preferences, so we can provide you with individual and interest-based contents and promotional offers. Pseudonymous usage profiles do not allow us to draw any conclusions as to your identity, and we do not combine user profiles with data that directly identifies you (e.g., email address), unless you have explicitly allowed us to do so.
3.11 To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities (including, without limitation, copyright infringement) on or through the Website.
4. Third-Party Services
We work with various third-party vendors to provide services through the Website to improve the user experience, to better understand how users interact with the Website, and to help provide our users content and advertising that reflects their interests.
4.1 Loyalty Rewards Program
If you sign-up for our loyalty rewards program, we may share your information with technical third party service providers with which we have entered into a contractual relationship to assist with the administration of the program. These service providers may process your email address and other personal data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions, including to help us issuing the Rewards. Our service providers are prohibited from using this information to contact you on their behalf or to disclose the information to third parties, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf.
4.2 Newsletter
If you sign-up for our newsletter, we may share your information with technical services providers with which we have entered into a contractual relationship to help us manage newsletter subscriptions and related marketing services. These service providers may process your email address and other personal data on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions, including to help us evaluate the usage of our newsletter, personalize your newsletter communications, compile reports on newsletter activities and provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of the newsletter. Our service providers are prohibited from using this information to contact you on their behalf or to disclose the information to third parties, except as necessary to perform services on our behalf..
4.3 Visitor Comments
We may offer Website Visitors the opportunity to post online comments on the Website about the coupons we offer. To help operate this commenting function on the Website, we may use third parties to integrate an online comments feature into the Website. These third parties may have access to the comments you submitted and may use the information you submit to ensure that the comment is reviewed or posted properly.
4.4 Financial Processing Services
We finance ourselves through commissions when Website Visitors use coupons offered on the Website to make online purchases. In order to be paid our commissions, we may receive information from our business partners (e.g., merchants) about online purchases made after visiting this Website, including purchases on websites of third parties (e.g., online-shops). Information about online purchases is transmitted to us automatically with the help of tracking cookies. We only receive commission-related information such as the value of your purchase and date and time of the transaction. We also work with several so-called affiliate networks (“Affiliate Networks”), which connect us with merchants and take over the technical and billing process. In these cases, we receive the respective information from such Affiliate Networks. We solely use this information for billing purposes.
4.5 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Tags and Scripts
We may use various tracking technologies to collect and process Automatically Collected Technical Data described in Section 2 of the Policy. The tracking tools we use may include cookies, Web beacons (also known as Pixel-Tags, tracking pixels, or clear GIFs), tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. When we collect information this way, we use it to better understand how Website Visitors are using the site.
When you click on a promotional offer, we may assign a unique identifier to the click (“Clickout-ID”). We provide this Clickout-ID to the respective business partner, on whose behalf the promotional offer is displayed. If you subsequently register or purchase something from that business partner (e.g., in an online-shop), the business partner can use the Clickout-ID to attribute the purchase to our Website. That is how we will earn our commission. We also work with several Affiliate Networks, which connect us with merchants and handle the technical and billing process. In these cases, we pass on the Clickout-ID to such Affiliate Networks. These Affiliate Networks may set their own tracking cookies when you visit our Website and click on an offer.

These third parties may place or recognize a unique cookie on your hard drive or use other tracking technologies.

Welcome to our Coupons Cookie Policy
Cookie Policy updated November 11, 2019
Global Savings Group (“GSG”) operates this Website in partnership with Business Insider in order to provide visitors to this Website (“Website Visitors”) like you access to curated coupons and promotions for products sold elsewhere online. Please carefully read the below Cookie Policy explaining how we use cookies on our website. We may edit this Policy from time to time, so please check this Policy regularly for any changes. We also recommend you view our Privacy Policy to learn more about how we use your data, why we use your data, and what we do with your data.
By continuing your use of https://coupons.businessinsider.com (“this Website”), you signify your consent to such use of cookies. You can also change your cookie preferences at any time.
1. Cookies and Similar Technologies
This section describes the specific types of cookies served through this Website, their purposes, and your options to manage them.
Cookies: Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device by your browser while you are visiting a website. Usually a cookie contains the website’s name using it and a string of text or a “unique identifier” which enables websites to recognize that cookie on each subsequent visit throughout its lifetime. Cookies can collect and store a wide range of information, such as the type of browser or operating system used, language or other browser settings, or your interaction with the website. Usually cookies are not used to collect data that itself identifies an individual. However, information collected with cookies may become associated with a natural person, if it is combined with personal information.
Some cookies (called session cookies) erase their records about you when you close your browser. Other cookies (called persistent cookies) erase their records about you at some preset time, regardless of whether you close your browser. We may use both types of cookies, whether we place them directly on the site, or whether third-parties place them on the site for us. The data from these cookies is then used to enable features on the site and to help us better understand how users experience the Website.
Apart from cookies, we also use other tracking technologies.
Web beacons, embedded scripts and other similar technologies: We and our third-party partners may also use similar technologies on this Website, such as web beacons (also called Pixel-Tags, tracking pixels, clear GIFs) or scripts. Web Beacons are small graphic images (that may be embedded into websites or in HTML emails), which are usually not visible for the Website Visitor. They track the Website Visitor’s interaction with this Website or the services our vendors help us provide. For example, they help us to understand whether or not you read our content or if you clicked on the links contained within our content. An embedded script or pixel is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with this Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Website, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies by your browser settings, they typically work in conjunction with cookies; accordingly, declining cookies in your browser will, in most cases, impair functioning of these technologies as well.
2. Types of Cookies served through this Website
We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons:
Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to provide fundamental functions of this Website, e.g., to enable you to browse this Website and use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. For instance, we use these strictly necessary cookies to embed contact forms on this Website.
Tracking Cookies: These cookies are used to track the use of promotional offers provided on this Website. They solely serve the purpose to allocate sales or other transactions to the respective offer on our Website in order to receive our commission. Tracking cookies are stored on your device until you change your cookie settings.
Functionality cookies: These cookies enable us to remember your preferences (such as your cookie choices), but are not essential to the use of the Website. Functionality cookies are stored on your device until you change your cookie settings.
Analytic and performance cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how this Website is being used, to improve user experience and fix issues on the Website quickly or to help us customize our Website and services for you in order to enhance your experience. These cookies may be placed by us or by third parties.
3. How you can control your Cookie settings
If you want to delete or disable cookies, you can do so using your browser’s settings. Most browsers currently accept cookies automatically. However, if you prefer, you can configure your browser settings in a way that no cookies are stored on your computer or to notify you before a new cookie is placed. Each browser is a little different, so please follow your browser instructions on how to manage your browser settings.
If you use different devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.) please make sure that each browser on each device is adjusted to reflect your cookie preferences.
Some internet browsers may include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. As uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted yet, this Website does not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals.
Please note that if you fully deactivate cookies, you may be unable to use some or all features of this Website.
You do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time, although you may not be able to use certain features on this Website. You can do this by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.
Please follow the links below to helpful information for the most popular browsers:
Microsoft Internet Explorer: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies
Google Chrome: https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
Apple Safari: https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/enable-cookies-ibrw850f6c51/mac
Mozilla Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences
In addition, you can exercise advertising cookie choices by requesting that certain advertising networks not track you, such as https://youradchoices.com/control and https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.
Please note that such websites will contain a list of numerous participating companies, many of which we do not work with. When you opt out of being tracked by these advertising networks, such networks will stop serving you targeted advertising based on the data collected via your browser, but they may continue to collect and use information for other purposes.

2.2 Other data we might collect:

This also includes internal business purposes such as troubleshooting, data analysis, testing and research.

As we finance ourselves through commissions to provide our service free of charge to you, we may use information about your visit to our website, i.e. your click on of promotional offers for reporting purposes in order to bill and collect our commission from business partners.
to provide you with personalised content. We also use this information to tailor our content and promotional offers we may display on this Website or send to you to your interests. For this purpose we create pseudonymised usage profiles. These usage profiles help us to better understand your needs and preferences so that we can provide you with individual and interest-based contents and promotional offers.

for Advertising and (Re-)Targeting purposes. We or more specifically the advertising partners as outlined in this addendum, also use this information in order to deliver targeted advertising on this Website or on websites of third parties which is based on your prior visit to this Website.
