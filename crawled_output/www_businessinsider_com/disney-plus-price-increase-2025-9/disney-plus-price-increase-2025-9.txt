Notifications sent to account holders on Tuesday said that stand-alone Hulu subscriptions will also see a price increase beginning in October. A monthly Hulu subscription with ads will now cost $11.99, up from $9.99.The planned price hikes come after Disney made another big announcement this week, bringing back late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.Disney faced backlash and calls for a boycott of its streaming services over ABC's decision last week to suspend Kimmel's late-night talk show, "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" The outcry spread as some subscribers considered canceling their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions.
Disney said Monday that Kimmel's show would resume on Tuesday.
