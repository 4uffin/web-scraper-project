President Donald Trump celebrated ABC pulling Jimmy Kimmel off the air after controversial comments.
ABC said it was pulling Kimmel indefinitely following comments he made after Charlie Kirk's death.
Trump urged NBC to cancel its late-night hosts, too.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the news that ABC was pulling "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for comments the host made following Charlie Kirk's death — and he wants other late-night hosts to be next.
"Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT."Trump appeared to be referencing the NBC late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.
The White House and a representative for NBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The Jimmy Kimmel fallout is ramping up. Get caught up here:Here's what Jimmy Kimmel said about Charlie Kirk on his late-night show that got him pulled off the airThere's a $6.2 billion deal looming over Jimmy Kimmel's suspensionLate-night TV is under threat from Trump and a precarious business modelThese are the demands ABC-affiliate Sinclair is making to air Jimmy Kimmel againPeter Kafka: The Trump administration forcing Jimmy Kimmel off the air is bad. Very bad.Trump also referred to Stephen Colbert, whose late-night show on CBS was canceled in July. CBS said the cancellation was "purely a financial decision."ABC, which is owned by Disney, confirmed to Business Insider earlier on Wednesday that it was pulling Kimmel off the air indefinitely. The decision came after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, publicly condemned Kimmel's comments about Kirk, and after Nexstar, which owns ABC affiliate stations, said it would be pulling Kimmel.
Sinclair, which also owns ABC affiliate stations, said in a post on X that it had also informed ABC it would be pulling Kimmel.

The cancellation followed comments the late-night host made on Monday's episode of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!""We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said.
Democratic lawmakers were swift to condemn the cancellation on social media."Everybody across the political spectrum should be speaking out to stop what's happening to Jimmy Kimmel," Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote. Sens. Ed Markey and Adam Schiff also expressed outrage at the suspension.
