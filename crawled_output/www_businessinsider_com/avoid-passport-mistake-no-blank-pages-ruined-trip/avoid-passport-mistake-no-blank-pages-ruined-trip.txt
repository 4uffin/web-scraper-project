I flew 17 hours to Indonesia, only to find out I'd made a mistake with my passport.
I wasn't allowed entry to the country because I didn't have at least two blank pages in my passport.
Now, I always check entry requirements far in advance — and I have a larger, 52-page passport.
After nearly 17 hours of air travel, I was groggy, jet-lagged, and excited to embark on a 10-day cruise through Asia for work.
I was ready for a few days of relaxation at sea, sipping Champagne and enjoying caviar.So, I was quite surprised when, after landing, I was pulled aside at immigration in Indonesia and escorted away from the arrivals area to a small, windowless room.
Turns out, I'd made a simple (but important) mistake with my passport.To gain entry to Indonesia, my passport needed to have at least 2 blank pages

After a few hours of anxiously waiting for answers, I learned that I'd been stopped because my passport didn't have enough empty space.Like several countries, Indonesia requires at least two full blank pages in your passport for entry. However, as a frequent traveler who's been to over 70 countries, mine was filled with stamps and visas.
Not a single blank page was left, which meant I didn't have enough space for another stamp and wouldn't be able to enter the country. Instead, I'd have to head back home.With no travel budget to spare, I frantically called a friend who stayed up with me all night, helping me purchase an expensive last-minute, same-day ticket home.

From there, I spent several more hours sitting on the floor of the airport terminal until I could board my 15-hour flight back to the US.
Now, I always check passport requirements before leaving the countryThough my story makes for fascinating dinner party fodder, I'd rather not live through this experience again. After all, I missed my cruise and had to pay thousands to remedy my mistake.Nowadays, to avoid another incident like this, I always check a country's blank page requirements on the US State Department website long before heading to the airport.Had I done this research earlier, I could've avoided the oh-so-stressful debacle I had in Bali.
Plus, when I renewed my passport, I requested the larger, 52-page version (as opposed to the standard 26-page option). This small change provided me with peace of mind knowing I wouldn't have to scramble to find blank pages for a while. I'm happy to report that now, my passport always has ample space for a stamp (or three).Fortunately, I made it back to Bali not just once, but three times since this experience. In fact, it's one of my favorite places to visit. I just make sure my pages are blank before I go.
