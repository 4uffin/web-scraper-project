Elizabeth Banks says her antiaging routine is simple: sleep, water, and a positive mindset.
"Getting rid of negative self-talk and just being positive about how you feel about yourself," Banks said.
The actor also says she sees aging as something to embrace.
Elizabeth Banks, 51, says a simple routine is her key to aging well.
"Water, better nutrition, eight hours of sleep. I'm struggling [with the latter] now that school has come back," Banks, who has two sons, told People in an interview published on Tuesday."I've really come to terms with the fact that I need seven to eight hours of sleep. It affects everything about me, including the way that I look and including the way my skin feels," the actor said.
To stay hydrated, Banks also makes it a point to start every morning by drinking two full glasses of water. Beyond that, having a positive mindset also helps."It's your attitude. Getting rid of negative self-talk and just being positive about how you feel about yourself," Banks said.For her, it also means seeing growing older as something to embrace.
"I am aging, and I'm happy about it," she said.This isn't the only time Banks has spoken about welcoming the aging process. In 2023, she told People she'd "never put a needle in her face."

"I make my living with my face. And basically, I'm terrified of f---ing it up," Banks said. She added that she tends to think about altering her appearance when her self-esteem dips, a reminder that she hasn't been taking care of herself.
"When I'm exercising and eating well and feeling good about myself and am confident, like 'Did I make a good decision today? Did I mom the s--t out of my kids today?' That's when I think I look and feel amazing," Banks said.A representative for Banks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.Research has shown that drinking water can aid in weight loss and improve the appearance of skin. The US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that adult males drink about 3.7 liters of water a day and that adult females drink about 2.7 liters of water a day.
Getting quality sleep can also help boost your overall longevity. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute warns that sleep deficiency is linked to diabetes, obesity, depression, heart disease, and other serious health conditions.Alongside sleep, managing stress is another key to reducing serious health risks. Research has found that chronic stress can weaken the immune system and may also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal problems.
