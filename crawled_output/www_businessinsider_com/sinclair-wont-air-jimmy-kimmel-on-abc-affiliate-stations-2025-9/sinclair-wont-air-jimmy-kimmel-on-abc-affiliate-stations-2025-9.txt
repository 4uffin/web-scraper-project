Sinclair said it will not air Jimmy Kimmel's show on its ABC affiliate stations.
Disney announced on Monday that Jimmy Kimmel's show will return on Tuesday.
Sinclair will replace the show with news programming and is in talks with ABC.
Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to ABC on Tuesday night after nearly a week off the air, but millions of viewers still won't see him.
Sinclair, which owns or controls 39 ABC affiliate stations, said it will not air Jimmy Kimmel's show after Disney announced on Monday that it would return Tuesday night."Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," the company said in a statement posted to X Monday.
ABC, which is owned by Disney, said last week that it pulled Jimmy Kimmel off the air "indefinitely" over his comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk and Trump's subsequent response. The decision came after FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly condemned Kimmel's comments and warned that broadcast licenses could be reviewed and that broadcasters are required to operate "in the public interest."After Kimmel's suspension, Sinclair released a list of demands in order to broadcast the comedian's late-night show again, including an apology and a donation to Kirk's family or his organization.Kimmel's temporary suspension from the air was immediately met with concerns over freedom of speech and the First Amendment. On Monday, over 400 Hollywood entertainers, including at least four Disney Legends, signed a letter in support of Kimmel.
Disney, which owns ABC, said on Monday that some of Kimmel's remarks about Kirk's killer were "ill-timed" and "insensitive." The company said it had "thoughtful conversations" with the host and determined he would resume taping this week.Nextstar, Sinclair, and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
