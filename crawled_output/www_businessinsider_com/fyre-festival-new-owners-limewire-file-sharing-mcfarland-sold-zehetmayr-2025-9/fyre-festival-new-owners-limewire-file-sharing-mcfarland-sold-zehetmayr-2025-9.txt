Fyre Festival founder and CEO Billy McFarland sold the event's branding rights in an eBay auction.
LimeWire, a file-sharing service that was once a hotbed for illegal downloads, won that auction.
LimeWire outbid Ryan Reynolds' ad agency, Maximum Effort, for the rights and paid $245,300.
When Billy McFarland, the founder and CEO of the failed Fyre Festival, said he had auctioned the branding rights to the event on eBay in July, he did not mention who had bought it.
Two months later, the mysterious buyer of the infamous event has finally come forward to claim their purchase.The file-sharing service company LimeWire said in a statement on Tuesday that it had officially acquired the Fyre Festival brand "after a competitive bidding process" that included Ryan Reynolds' viral ad agency, Maximum Effort.
"Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history," Julian Zehetmayr, the co-CEO of LimeWire, said on Tuesday."We're not bringing the festival back — we're bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches," he added.When approached for comment, Zehetmayr told Business Insider that they had started negotiating a potential acquisition for the event's branding rights even before the eBay auction, but the talks fell through.
"A few weeks later, we then ended up being the highest bidder on eBay," Zehetmayr said.Zehetmayr said McFarland and the former Fyre Festival team will not be involved with the event after its acquisition. Instead, Limewire's in-house teams in Vienna and London will run it by themselves, he added.McFarland did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
The Fyre Festival gained notoriety after festival attendees were greeted with a sight resembling a disaster drill when they arrived in the Bahamas in April 2017.Instead of villas and gourmet meals, guests were housed in FEMA disaster relief tents and served unappetizing cheese sandwiches. Bahamian locals who worked as caterers and laborers for the event said they were not paid their salaries.McFarland pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud related to the festival in 2018. He was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $26 million to investors, festival attendees, and vendors.
In March 2022, McFarland was released from prison early. He initially touted a sequel to the Fyre Festival in 2023 but eventually decided to sell the event's branding rights in April.
