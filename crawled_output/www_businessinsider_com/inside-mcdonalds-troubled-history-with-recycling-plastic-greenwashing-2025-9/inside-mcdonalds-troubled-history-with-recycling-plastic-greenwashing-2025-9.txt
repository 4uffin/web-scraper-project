This is an adapted excerpt from "Consumed: How Big Brands Got Us Hooked on Plastic," by Saabira Chaudhuri.McDonald's has relied on disposable packaging since 1948. That's when Richard and Maurice McDonald fired all the waitresses at their McDonald Brothers Burger Bar Drive-In restaurant in San Bernardino, California.They rolled out an entirely new model of serving food designed to be high-volume, very cheap, and very fast. Central to that new way of working was replacing the silverware and china plates with disposable bags, cups, and plates made from paper.
By getting consumers to just throw cups and other packaging away, the McDonald brothers neatly rid themselves of the cost and hassle of washing and drying hundreds of pieces of dishware each day. When Ray Kroc bought the rights to franchise McDonald's nationwide, he naturally followed the same model, and McDonald's became one of the largest users of paper packaging in America.But the paper containers didn't retain heat well, and through the 1960s, worries about deforestation mounted. Studies showed that paper made up as much as 60% of US highway litter and half of what people threw away in big cities. In large part to allay environmental concerns, McDonald's decided to switch away from paper to plastic containers for its Big Macs. On September 22, 1975 McDonald's rolled out the polystyrene clamshell container across the US.The polystyrene kept food hot, was easy to layer sandwiches in and, crucially, was cheap. A decade later, McDonald's launched the double clamshell to house a new burger, lettuce and tomato sandwich it called the McDLT. The company's hard-charging US president Ed Rensi poured an estimated $100 million into advertising it in the first few months of its launch.The sandwich in its fancy new container was a hit. But a few years later, McDonald's found itself under fire.
An estimated 3,000 tons of polystyrene were ending up in North American trash cans every day and activists and lawmakers increasingly saw McDonald's as emblematic of a convenience culture that was spiraling out of control. Suffolk County in New York and Berkeley, California had passed bans on polystyrene, while legislatures in 26 US states were considering banning or restricting foam containers.The allegation that McDonald's was destroying nature started to get picked up by the press. "It was a nightmare for us," says Shelby Yastrow, who served as general counsel from 1978 to 1998 and at the time was also the company's environmental head. "I would go to cocktail parties or friends' homes for dinner and that's the first thing that would always come up."The company argued, head-scratchingly, that having its clamshells — four billion of which were discarded annually — sitting in landfills was a good thing since it helped "aerate the soil." To push through legislatures' escape clauses, McDonald's exploited a loophole: recycling. As long as companies could show that foam was being recycled, legislators indicated they'd allow it.The person in charge of McDonald's clamshell recycling efforts was a curly-haired, towering 33-year-old named Bob Langert. Growing up in the 1960s in South Side Chicago, Langert had harbored a quiet fascination with men like Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy. For as long as he could remember, he'd wanted to do something to "change the world."
His moment came in 1988. "My job was very specific: to save the polystyrene clamshell by developing a recycling program for it," recalls Langert.Telling customers to recycle was an easy and inexpensive marketing strategy. But getting people to fastidiously separate their trash and empty their food waste was hard. McDonald's tracked how diners behaved and estimated that, at best, a third of customers recycled correctly.

Langert cringes as he remembers visiting recycling plants in Brooklyn and Leominster, Massachusetts. Stinking garbage trucks ostensibly delivering empty clamshells unloaded rotting food and used paper napkins. "By the time it got transported to the recycling center, it smelled like high heaven and was very attractive to vermin," he tells me.McDonald's tracked how diners behaved and estimated that, at best, a third of customers recycled correctly.The resulting quality was so poor that Rubbermaid and others who had said they'd turn the used polystyrene into trays and waste baskets refused to buy it.
Despite all this, McDonald's trumpeted its recycling efforts. In 1990, a six-page booklet called "McDonald's and the Environment" began showing up in the chain's outlets across the country. It described polystyrene as "following in the footsteps of highly recycled materials such as glass and aluminium" and "the only foodservice packaging available that is 100% recyclable and is being recycled."Yastrow hired a PR consultant known for helping companies neutralize criticism from environmentalists. Charles Yulish advised McDonald's to make sweeping recycling pledges and form highly publicised alliances with reputable nonprofits. "He said, 'Show you're green. You have to be proactive,"' recalls Yastrow.Yastrow took the advice, publicly pledging that before the turn of the century there would be a recycled McDonald's restaurant with countertops, seats, and flooring made from recycled plastics (there wasn't), and that by 1992 all the chain's restaurants would recycle their polystyrene (they didn't).In August 1990, McDonald's teamed up with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund in a wide-ranging waste-reduction partnership. At Yulish's urging, McDonald's also struck an alliance with the World Wildlife Fund, paying $1 million to fund a magazine for schoolchildren featuring the WWF logo that plugged the fast-food chain's environmental activities and defended its use of polystyrene. It was the largest-ever educational program for schools at the time, reaching 5 million teachers and students.
Looking back, Langert says that some of what McDonald's was doing would now be called greenwashing. "We were creating all these programs and policies because now we were at the forefront of being characterized as being bad for the environment," he says. "We were desperate to find a way to get the credibility to get this monkey off our back."It was Halloween 1990 and Langert had just stumbled across a draft press release announcing that McDonald's polystyrene recycling program would roll out to all the company's 8,500 restaurants nationwide.A year after the Leominster plant had opened, about two-thirds of what was coming in from restaurants was food and other non-polystyrene waste. By now, Langert was firmly convinced there was no way McDonald's could make recycling work. "The testing was going horribly," he says. "I was shocked that they would do this."

He found Yastrow, laying out to the general counsel why McDonald's couldn't justify even the two recycling operations it was involved in, let alone expanding the program. Yastrow had harbored his own reservations about recycling polystyrene for months. The big hurdle that remained was Rensi.
Yastrow phoned Fred Krupp, head of the EDF, who got his lead toxicologist on a call with Rensi. She explained how the International Agency for Research on Cancer had recently classified styrene as "possibly carcinogenic." There was some evidence showing that styrene oxide was cancerous in animals, which indicated it might have a similar impact on human beings. The toxicologist minced no words in explaining that she thought recycling polystyrene was a very bad idea.For Rensi, after years of staunchly defending his precious container, the allegation that it could cause cancer went too far. "That was the straw that broke the camel's back," says Langert.The next morning, McDonald's PR department did send out a press release, but not the one Langert had found. Instead, in a shock move, it announced it would abandon the clamshell.Rather than admit defeat on environmental or even health grounds, Rensi cited an emotional reason for the shift. "Although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging is environmentally sound, our customers just don't feel good about it," he told reporters.
McDonald's didn't consider returning to washable containers. Instead, the company swapped the clamshell for disposable waffle-patterned paper sandwiched on either side of a sheet of low-density polyethylene. In other words, it was plastic layered with paper and very hard to recycle.McDonald's scored a huge public relations win. "Let's Hope More Companies Copy McDonald's Effort," enthused the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. "McDonald's is at last showing some McSense on the environment," wrote a New York Times reporter whose story was titled "Greening of the Golden Arch."In time, McDonald's switched to a cardboard box that can technically be recycled. But in reverting to paper, the material it once abandoned because of concerns about deforestation, McDonald's may have traded one single-use problem for another.In reverting to paper, the material it once abandoned because of concerns about deforestation, McDonald's may have traded one single-use problem for another.My reporting — which includes interviews with McDonald's executives and staff as well as with waste companies and paper mill operators — shows that McDonald's is still struggling to convince people there for the fast food to slow down enough to scrape out leftovers. Recyclers don't want paper packaging with food in it since this degrades the fibers and can contaminate the mill's water supply. Paper that goes to landfills can break down to release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
McDonald's own research several years ago showed that customers simply bundled everything into the paper bag their orders came in so they could throw it all in a single bin. Asking them to separate pickles and soggy teabags from paper containers landed badly."People were quite angry about having to do it," Helen McFarlane, sustainability manager for McDonald's in the UK told me. "Even though people come in and they eat with their hands — there are no knives and forks or anything — when they go to the bins, they don't want to touch their food."Today, recycling remains McDonald's first line of defense—its shield against laws that would ban or tax throwaway packaging, or force it back to the reusable containers the McDonald brothers cast off in 1948.Saabira Chaudhuri is a London-based business journalist and the author of "Consumed: How Big Brands Got Us Hooked on Plastic."
