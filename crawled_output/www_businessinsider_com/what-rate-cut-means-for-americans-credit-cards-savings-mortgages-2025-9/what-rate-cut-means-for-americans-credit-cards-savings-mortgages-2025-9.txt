The first interest-rate cut of the year is here, and it could eventually mean savings for Americans.
The Fed meeting follows soft job growth, rising unemployment, and increasing inflation rates.
A rate cut could ease borrowing costs, but it won't significantly impact Americans' mortgages or credit.
The Fed's long-awaited interest-rate cuts are here, and it could mean lower mortgage rates — eventually.
The Federal Reserve opted to cut rates by a quarter-percentage point on Wednesday, in alignment with expectations. Economic projections show Fed members have penciled in two more rate cuts this year: one more than previously planned.The cut could provide relief for borrowers and trickle down to American consumers, especially those looking to purchase homes, buy cars, take out loans, and use credit cards. But Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, said it isn't a sign of celebration or economic health.
"This isn't the victory parade over conquering inflation," Kates said. "This is potentially making a cut because the economy is faltering, and that's not necessarily a good thing."The impact on housing, autos, and credit cardsRate cuts can provide relief to borrowers, but Kates said a single move won't have a massive effect on consumers.Thirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to move up and down alongside the federal funds rate, though factors like inflation and investor behavior can also have a major impact on borrowing costs. It can take time and multiple Fed moves to filter through to those consumer-facing rates.
Kates said that a September cut wouldn't immediately cause rates to fall "simply because some of that has already happened in anticipation of the actual event."

That's been the case for mortgage rates: the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has largely been cooling this summer.While a rate cut would lead to a boon for borrowers, savers would likely see lower gains. "Consumers should be caring about this rate cut because it could make debt more affordable, but it can also lower the yield that people are getting on savings vehicles like high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposits," Sean Pyles, ​​a personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told Business Insider.
Pyles said credit card rates tend to drop when the Fed lowers the federal funds rate, but it can take months or several billing cycles before this has an effect.Any substantial changes in borrowing costs for consumers would likely come from multiple rate cuts over the coming months, not the single September decision. Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said that a smaller 25-basis-point cut "would not have hugely consequential implications for the lives of most Americans" since the benchmark would still be restrictive."However, if it is the beginning of a sustained rate reduction campaign, that would be more meaningful, reducing economic headwinds and potentially giving the housing market a boost," Hamrick said.
