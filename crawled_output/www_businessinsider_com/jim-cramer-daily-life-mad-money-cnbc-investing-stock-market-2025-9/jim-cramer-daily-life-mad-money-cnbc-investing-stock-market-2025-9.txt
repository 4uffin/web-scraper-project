Jim Cramer is a busy man.
The "Mad Money" host, known for his emphatic delivery and bold stock calls on the air, gave a rundown of his hectic schedule when speaking on Bloomberg's "Odd Lots" podcast on Monday.Here were the highlights of his routine:
The longtime investing personality said he kicks off his day at 3:15 a.m. Given his bedtime of 11 p.m., that puts Cramer at around 4 hours of sleep.Cramer said the first 45 minutes of his day are on a "tight schedule," due to his 4 a.m. workout. Before the hour, he brushes up on the market by perusing the Financial Times, Bloomberg, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and CNBC.
Cramer said he read up on everything that seemed "relevant" when scanning in the markets in the morning.

Cramer also said that he sifts through stock research in his inbox, combing through around 700 emails a day.
"I read everything I think is relevant, and I'm looking for something to say. I have a memo that comes out, ten things I'm looking at," Cramer said, referring to his weekday morning newsletter for CNBC's Investing Club."So that's my overlord," he said of the newsletter.

Then, Cramer appears on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" program and begins writing "Mad Money," his flagship show on the network, in the mid-morning.
Throughout the day, Cramer said he spends a "huge amount of time" reading up on company news and earnings reports.He finishes taping "Mad Money" around quarter to six and comes home. He'll go out to dinner around 10 p.m. and then say good night to his wife before tucking in.Cramer acknowledged that the intensity of his schedule puts strain on his marriage.
"I have a great marriage. I put that out first because I wreck it every day," he said. "I go to bed at 11. She goes to bed at like, a normal time. So that's when I really wreck the marriage. That's not the plan — I don't set out to do that," he added, though he said he finds his schedule necessary to keep up with markets.Cramer's routine doesn't appear to have changed much over the years. In 2015, he told Business Insider that he followed a similar schedule, which involved waking up at 3 a.m., tweeting about stocks and puppies in the morning, and making a pit stop at the headquarters of TheStreet, which he co-founded in 1996.
