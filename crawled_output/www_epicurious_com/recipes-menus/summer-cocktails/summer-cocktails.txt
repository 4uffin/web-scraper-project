However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.No single spirit has a hold on summertime. Great summer cocktails can start with gin, rum, vodka, or tequila (or in the case of the Long Island Iced Tea, all of the above). Sure, whiskey can come out to play too. And plenty of our favorite summer sippers are low in alcohol, with just a touch of sherry or a splash of Aperol, or totally free of booze. Anything goes, really, as long as the drink is cooling and fun to sip (Sea Breeze, anyone?).Below you’ll find our essential summer drinks, including simple highballs, flavor-packed slushies, big-batch pitcher cocktails, and plenty of tipples that make the most of ripe fruit. These fresh (and occasionally bubbly) summer cocktails are meant for warm weather. So whether you’re in search of a classic daiquiri (or a frozen one) or something fresh and new (hello, avocado margarita), stock your freezer with ice and get scrolling before your next backyard gathering.Specifically looking for low-alcohol cocktails? Take a spin through our cocktail ABV calculator.Photo by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne1/47Our Favorite Aperol SpritzThe ultimate summer cocktail might be a spritz sipped in an Italian piazza, but a really good spritz at home is a pretty decent runner-up. This version is a little lighter on the orangey aperitif for extra refreshment. Serve with salty snacks like potato chips or olives.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Micah Marie Morton2/47Rosie Ranch WaterIf you’re on the hunt for easy summer cocktails, it doesn’t get much simpler than Texas ranch water. Once you’ve got the basic formula down, add your own flourishes. (The spicy salt on this guy is truly fabulous.)Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Micah Marie Morton3/47SangriaAny summertime dinner can be improved with a pitcher of sangria. This classic one uses red, not white wine (if you’re looking for a blonde version, try this one from José Andrés). Seek out superfine granulated sugar for this recipe, which dissolves quickly in the wine and liqueur.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Micah Marie Morton4/47Frozen Watermelon MargaritaThe best way to cool down this summer isn’t with a dip in the pool: It’s with a sip of this pretty frozen watermelon margarita.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Rebecca Jurkevich5/47Pimm’s CupThis simple, low-alcohol summertime cocktail only needs two ingredients: fragrant Pimm’s liqueur and ginger ale or ginger beer. Garnish the glasses with sliced cucumber and fresh mint leaves.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Micah Marie Morton6/47Tequila SunriseBoost your spirits with sunshine in a cup, a colorful mainstay of tropical resorts, beach barbecues, and ’70s rock stars: the classic tequila sunrise.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo7/47Long Island Iced TeaGin, vodka, rum, and tequila, all in one drink? It’s none other than the Long Island Iced Tea, the original party drink of the season. In addition to the basic recipe, we’ve included a few variations on this classic: Swap the cola for cranberry juice to make a Long Beach Iced Tea, or add whiskey to make a Texas Tea. Take it in any direction you’d like—just don’t forget to hydrate.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Kaitlin Wayne8/47Piña ColadaWith its winning combination of coconut, pineapple juice, and rum, this piña colada recipe is creamy, just sweet enough, and utterly refreshing.

A truly great Paloma layers on the grapefruit flavors—zingy grapefruit soda (preferably Ting) makes up most of the drink, but a squeeze of fresh grapefruit juice brightens the mix and deepens its citrusy character.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Travis Rainey, Food Styling by Tiffany Schleigh10/47Mai TaiPeople have thrown all manner of things into a mai tai, but this recipe is legit: a rum sour made with lime, an orange liqueur, and orgeat—the fragrant almond cocktail syrup. You’ll need two rums here to make this classic cocktail really shine: one grassy, fresh rhum agricole, and another rum that's been aged in barrels.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Chelsea Kyle, Food Styling by Kat Boytsova11/47Frozen Boozy Arnold PalmerTransform the classic iced tea–lemonade combo into a refreshing frozen cocktail for summer. Freezing the tea and lemonade into ice cubes before blending is an easy way to keep the flavors concentrated.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto & Food Styling by Joseph De Leo12/47The Most Refreshing Gin and TonicThe best gin and tonic is all in the technique, because the most important ingredient in a G&T is not really the gin, or even the tonic. It’s carbonation.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto & Food Styling by Joseph De Leo13/47Frozen Gin and TonicWhat do you get when you take classic summer cocktails like the G&T and put them in an ice-filled blender? Well, a little adaptation is required, but once you skip the fizz (using tonic syrup instead of tonic water) you get one of the world's most refreshing summer drinks.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Susan Ottaviano14/47Jam SessionThree ingredients.
