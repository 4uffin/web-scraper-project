So, as the weekend approaches, we’ve gathered some of the best recipes to get you ready for sweater weather, like silky miso-pumpkin ramen, hearty apple-pecan muffins, and an easy sherry-based cocktail.Photo & Food Styling by Joseph De Leo1/11Miso-Squash RamenTo make this new recipe from Hetty McKinnon, you'll roast the squash (with a bit of miso rubbed on) and keep some of it in wedges. The rest gets blended into the savory broth for a velvety texture. If you're thinking ahead to next week, though, we recommend cooking a little extra squash, since it's great to have around for filling sandwiches or topping bowls of savory oatmeal, congee, or hummus.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by William Meppem2/11Roasted Pumpkin, Marjoram, and Blue Cheese FrittataCubes of butternut squash, plus a generous amount of blue cheese, cheddar, and Parm make this frittata the definition of autumnal comfort.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Laura Murray, Food Styling by Susan Spungen3/11Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot CakeThis halwa-inspired carrot cake skips the raisins, cinnamon, and cream cheese frosting—and puts brown butter pistachios, cardamom, and sticky carrot glaze at center stage.Get This RecipeSave StorySave GalleryPhoto by Joseph De Leo, Food Styling by Erika Joyce4/11Chicken PelauThis pelau is one of our favorite dishes from Ramin Ganeshram's new collection.
