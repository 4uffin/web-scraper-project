For months our editors toured the country, eating meal after meal, to ultimately come up with the 20 Best New Restaurants of 2025. Each restaurant offers personal storytelling through the exquisite food and is worthy of a visit.While you wait for a reservation to open at one of these spots, might we suggest some outstanding restaurant recipes to make at home in the meantime? The team from Fet-Fisk, a Nordic-inspired seafood restaurant in Pittsburgh, has shared their grilled cabbage Caesar, a year-round menu item. The cabbage is charred, cooled, then doused in a creamy anchovy-packed dressing. Komal, a bustling spot in Los Angeles’ Mercado La Paloma, showed us how to make their pan de elote, a custardy cake topped with a corn whipped cream.If you need both fresh and comforting weeknight meals, our Test Kitchen’s got ideas. Try this Vinegar Chicken With Figs; the sauce is sticky and buttery, best sopped up with a hunk of bread. Or make this Gnocchi Piccata, where pillowy pasta meets a briny, citrus-forward sauce. It all comes together in one skillet, making it a fuss-free dinnertime hero. Keep reading for all the recipes from our October issue.Not a subscriber yet?
