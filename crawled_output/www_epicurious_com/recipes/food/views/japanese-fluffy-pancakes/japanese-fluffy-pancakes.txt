That’s a lot easier to pull off with two key ingredients in this recipe: egg whites whisked into meringue-like peaks and Kewpie Mayonnaise, which has emulsified oil and vinegar to help the batter rise (literally and figuratively) to the occasion. Make sure to follow the instructions for cooking the pancakes very carefully, because the unique method of layering the batter is crucial in achieving that height and cloud-like texture.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreMaple TamagoyakiFrom author Sonoko Sakai, this Japanese omelet is distinguished by its fluffy layers, with a touch of sweetness from maple syrup.Hong Kong Egg Scramble“Soft and pillowy, custardy and light—they were unlike any other scrambled eggs I had experienced before.”Kimchi Gim Bugak (Fried Seaweed Chips)Bugak is the ideal light beer snack: It’s crunchy, salty, and the fresher it’s made, the better.
