Sami TamimiJune 29, 20255.0(1)Photo by Issy CrokerArrowJump To RecipeSave StorySave this storyPrintKubez bread, also known as kimaaj, is Arabic flatbread or pita bread. It is a staple in the Middle East and is used as a versatile accompaniment for various dishes or as a wrap for sandwiches.Kubez is typically round and flat, with a soft and chewy texture. The dough is rolled out into thin rounds and baked at a high temperature, causing it to puff up and create a pocket inside, perfect for stuffing with vegetables, spreads, or dips.I’ve used 100% all-purpose flour for this recipe, but feel free to experiment with a blend of all-purpose and whole wheat flour if you prefer. The results will be equally fantastic.This bread can also be stored and reheated later, either by wrapping it in foil and warming it in the oven or by quickly toasting it under the broiler or on the stovetop.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreBánh Mì Khong (Bánh Mì Bread)Making your own crusty loaves is surprisingly easy.Tadka FocacciaThis tadka-topped focaccia is loaded with crispy curry leaves, black mustard seeds, white sesame seeds, and dried red chiles.Sfouf (Semolina Turmeric Cake)Semolina flour and turmeric give this simple cake a sunny hue and nutty flavor.Nankhatai (Semolina Shortbread)These cookies are gently sweetened and perfect with a cup of tea.Ta’ameya (Fava Bean Fritters)Serve these as you would falafel: in a pita, on top of a salad, or as a snack with a dip.Ube Milk CrinklesWith the sweet and nutty flavor of ube, these cookies taste like they’ve been dunked into a glass of milk.Grape DumplingsNative American people made these with cornmeal dumplings, simmering them with wild grapes, which were harvested at their peak sweetness.Kimchi Gim Bugak (Fried Seaweed Chips)Bugak is the ideal light beer snack: It’s crunchy, salty, and the fresher it’s made, the better.
