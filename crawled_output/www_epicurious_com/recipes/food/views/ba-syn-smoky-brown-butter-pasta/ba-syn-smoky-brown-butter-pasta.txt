Brown butter, smoked paprika, and garlic create a sauce that makes a big impact with no extra ingredients. Its success is twofold: First, make sure to really brown your butter. You’ll know it’s ready when the sizzling has subsided and it smells deeply of toasted nuts. The second is to add your smoked paprika to the brown butter as soon as it’s done. Blooming the spices in fat helps to release and heighten their flavor.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreSun Gold Tomato Pasta With Pistachio GremolataA garlicky pistachio topping takes this sunny summer pasta from good to great.Shrimp Scampi PastaWith lightning-quick shrimp and an easy garlic butter sauce, this crowd-pleasing pasta builds flavor fast.Cilantro Pesto PastaThis vibrant cilantro pesto recipe blends blanched herbs, Cotija cheese, garlic, and toasted pepitas.
