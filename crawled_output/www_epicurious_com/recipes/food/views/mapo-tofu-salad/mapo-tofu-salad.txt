This salad is inspired by the flavors of mapo tofu, but the textures are quite different. The pan-fried tofu is crispy yet pillowy, served with a punchy dressing that is made with the same bold flavors as mapo seasoning. Doubanjiang (or black bean sauce) and Sichuan peppercorns deliver big, tingly flavors—if you find the sauce too intense, add a bit more water to even out the flavors.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreKung Pao Cabbage With TofuReliable cabbage is cooked in the punchy sauce and then combined with store-bought baked tofu and roasted cashews for a salad that can also be eaten with rice.Crispy Tofu With Scallion-Ginger SauceThe tofu is crunchy on the outside, in part thanks to a panko-studded exterior, and squishy-in-a-good-way on the inside.
