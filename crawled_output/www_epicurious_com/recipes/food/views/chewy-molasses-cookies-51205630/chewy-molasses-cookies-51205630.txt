In the time it takes to preheat your oven, you can get nearly all of your work done: Mix the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ones in another and combine. A cookie scoop isn’t necessary but comes in handy for even-sized dough balls that you’ll roll in sanding sugar for a glittery finish before placing on the cookie sheet and baking.If you’re new to buying molasses, keep in mind that there are several varieties, including blackstrap molasses, and sulphured and unsulphured varieties. We prefer unsulphured for baking (sulphured molasses has a smoky backbone that’s great for barbecue, not so good for cookies). Choose a light variety for a mild molasses flavor, or opt for a robust, dark one for something bolder. The molasses keeps these cookies magically fresh and chewy for days in an airtight container, making them a perfect candidate for a holiday cookie tin or Christmas cookie plate.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery47 Thanksgiving Cookie Recipes to Give Pie Some CompetitionIt’s never a bad idea to have a plate of festive cookies around for holiday snacking.iconGallery37 Best Easy Cookie Recipes to Make Again and AgainDiscover delicious (but easy) cookies to make the next time you're in the mood for something sweet. iconGallery53 Easy Christmas Cookie RecipesGetting merry and bright has never been this simple.iconGallery41 Ways to Make GingerbreadWhat else that makes for good building and cookie material?iconGallery13 No-Bake and No-Wait Cookies to Get You Through the HolidaysDon't have hours to roll out dough, wait for it to chill, and let cookies cool before adding the finish touch?
