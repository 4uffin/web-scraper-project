Traditionally, it’s made with “maskara” or pork face—ears, cheeks, tongue—that’s grilled, sliced thin, and mixed with chiles, onions, and calamansi juice. For Sheldon Simeon, chef of Tiffany’s and Tin Roof in Maui, the dish is a go-to pulutan (bar snack) and a proud vestige of his Pinoy heritage. He trades the pig head for readily available pork belly, which, when grilled, offers the perfect balance of juicy fat and crispy meat.Classic dinakdakan recipes use pig brains as a creamy dressing for the grilled pork. Many cooks today, including Simeon, substitute mayonnaise, though he has chosen to leave it out here. If you’re curious, add about 2 Tbsp. mayo along with the ginger, fish sauce, and tangy dressing.A two-step cooking method—first in a vinegary, soy-heavy braise, then on the grill—renders the pork meltingly tender from edge to edge. A hefty amount of barely cooked shishito peppers adds extra crunch and offers a nice contrast to the rich, fatty pork. If you have some green onions, a generous shower on top would be quite welcome. Serve this Ilocano dish as an appetizer with ice-cold beers or turn it into a main dish by spooning over rice.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MorePad Kra PaoThis fast stir-fry dish pairs minced pork and fragrant basil with hot Thai chiles and a crispy fried egg.Grilled Chicken With Green Chili CrispThis speedy dinner features a verdant take on chili crisp, with scallions, jalapeños, and roasted peanuts for crunch.Chipotle-Citrus RibsTender, well-glazed, and just spicy enough, these ribs are the ultimate grill-out food.
