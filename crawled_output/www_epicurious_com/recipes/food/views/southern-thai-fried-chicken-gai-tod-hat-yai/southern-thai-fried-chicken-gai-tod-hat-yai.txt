From southern Thailand, gai hat yai is known for its crispy skin, great aromatics, and super juicy meat. Traditionally, it’s served with crispy fried shallots and sticky rice, but we also often eat it with som tum thai (green papaya salad). Over the years I have experimented with many different variations in the dipping and coating sauce to make this dish right up there with other popular fried chicken dishes of the world.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreCà Ri Gà (Vietnamese Chicken Curry)Serve with crusty bread to dip in the golden sauce.Moo Ping (Thai Grilled Pork Skewers)This version of pork skewers is made in the oven, which tastes just as good, but you could always throw these on the grill for a version closer to the original.Rotisserie Chicken CongeeLeftover rotisserie chicken finds new purpose in this endlessly comforting dish.Green Curry MusselsThe mussels here add their beautiful, briny juices into the curry, which turn this into a stunning and spectacular dish.Thai Curry Puff (Ga-ree Puff)These flaky, crispy pastries with a curry flavored filling are a popular snack sold in street food stalls and eateries all across Thailand.Spicy Honey Orange Shrimp (Xiang La Fengmi Xia)A satisfying weeknight dinner from Tiffy Chen.
