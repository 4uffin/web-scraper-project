Soft layers of pasta and béchamel are interspersed with a rich tomato sauce laden with hearty Mediterranean vegetables such as squash, zucchini, bell pepper, and eggplant and then topped with thin slices of Halloumi cheese for an irresistible appeal. I serve it with a crisp salad and some garlic bread. This freezes well, so it’s great for batch cooking.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MorePasta Alla MezcalThis marinara sauce is great tossed with any pasta for a quick and easy weeknight dinner that will leave you thinking, “Why didn’t anyone try this sooner?”Spaghetti With Cabbage, Pancetta, and Calabrian ChileCabbage is the unsung hero of the winter kitchen—available anywhere, long-lasting in the fridge, and super-affordable.
