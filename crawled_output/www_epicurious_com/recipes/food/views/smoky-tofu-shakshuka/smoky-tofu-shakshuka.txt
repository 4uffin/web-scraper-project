I like the sweetness that comes from using a rose or apricot harissa, but regular harissa will work well too—­as always, use what you can find and what you prefer! As the spice and heat levels of different brands of harissa can vary quite dramatically, start with my suggestion and then you can always add extra as a condiment when serving. The tomato sauce can be made ahead of time and keeps well in the fridge for up to a week.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreMicrowaved Tofu With Butter and Soy SauceThis custardy and comforting tofu comes together in minutes, all thanks to your microwave.
