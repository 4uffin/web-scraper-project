These pork spareribs—baked for a few hours, then grilled—hit every mark thanks in large part to a glaze made from orange marmalade, chipotles in adobo, and lime juice at the last minute for a final bit of brightness.These ribs also make a great entertaining main because they are fully cooked before they hit the grill, eliminating all the anxiety you might feel about getting meat to a certain temperature over an open flame. You’re grilling for vibes only—flip them and pull them as soon as they’ve hit your desired degree of char.These ribs are easiest to grill (and stick the least to grill grates) if they’re grilled from room temperature rather than warm. Give yourself enough time to let the ribs cool from the oven before grilling if you’re doing it all in one day; they’re even better if baked the day before and chilled overnight still wrapped in foil. Just unwrap and throw directly on the grill when you’re ready to go.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Summer IssueWe’ve got sausage with cabbage and giardiniera, tomato aguachile, and matcha-berry frozen yogurt.ChevronChevronRead MorePork DinakdakanBraise tender pork belly in soy and vinegar, then grill with shishito peppers and toss with ginger and a tangy dressing for bold, savory Filipino dinakdakan.Spice-Grilled Pork ChopsA pinch of sugar in the spice rub ensures picture-perfect grill marks with layers of flavor.Sheet-Pan Sausage With Corn, Peach, and Cucumber SaladThis summery sheet-pan dinner celebrates the bounty of the season and couldn't be simpler to make.
