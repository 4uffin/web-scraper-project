(Yeah, we said it.) Use a cast-iron skillet to caramelize the apples and bake the cake all in one vessel, a win-win. Ground nuts give the cake a toasty, deep flavor and tenderize the crumb by adding fat and countering flour’s glutinous toughness. And one more pro tip from Claire: Use a melon baller, or a sturdy teaspoon measure, to remove the core in the neatest scoop.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreHummingbird CakeOur spin on the beloved classic, featuring pineapple jam and cream cheese frosting.Chocolate Olive Oil CakeFruity olive oil means this fudgy cake will stay moist for days.Passion Fruit Olive Oil CakeA plush olive oil cake swirled with tangy passion fruit curd.Pistachio Bundt CakePredestined to be the star of your next weekend hang or holiday brunch.Sheet-Pan Pomegranate Chicken With Walnut RelishThis weeknight-friendly chicken dinner—made with pomegranate molasses and a toasted walnut relish—is inspired by the flavors of Persian fesenjan.Tiramisu Basque CheesecakeTwo of our all-time favorite desserts, now in one new classic.Neapolitan CakeInspired by Wayne Thiebaud’s iconic Cake Slice, these three distinct layers start with one simple batter.Diner-Style Apple Pie With Lattice CrustCut this easy-to-handle dough (thanks, cream cheese) into wide strips for a fast-forming lattice that stuns.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
