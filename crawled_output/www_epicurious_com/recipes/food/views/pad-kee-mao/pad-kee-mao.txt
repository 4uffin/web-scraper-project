One is that spicy food is what you crave while drinking (this checks out—Thai people love spicy foods any time of day, but especially when they’re drunk). Another is that they are the perfect hangover cure. Whatever the reason, you don’t need a night out to enjoy this dish. To make it my own, I use an Italian ingredient, spaghetti, instead of the traditional rice noodles Thai-talian fusion at its best. Spaghetti is actually a common variation in modern Thai cooking. It is so easy to work with and absorbs the garlicky, spicy notes of pad kee mao well. If you really want to lean into the fusion identity of this dish, pair it with a Negroni or spritz!Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreGreen Curry MusselsThe mussels here add their beautiful, briny juices into the curry, which turn this into a stunning and spectacular dish.Spicy Honey Orange Shrimp (Xiang La Fengmi Xia)A satisfying weeknight dinner from Tiffy Chen.
