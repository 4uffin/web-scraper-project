There are many things that appeal to me about a Basque cheesecake—it is crustless (one less job) and is meant to look “rustic” with its wrinkled and jagged sides thanks to the satisfyingly haphazard way of lining the pan. This vegan version also requires next to no prep: Everything is thrown into a high-speed blender or food processor and blitzed until smooth. The trickiest part of this recipe is the cook time—we want some wobble, but not too much that it will fall apart. The baking time will vary from oven to oven, so don’t be afraid to cook for longer if you need. The crucial element is the blackened top, so if your cheesecake has the right amount of wobble but is still not dark, place it under the broiler for 1–2 minutes, watching it closely so that it doesn’t burn. I often add a touch of ube paste to the mix, which gives it an iridescent lavender hue and a nuttier flavor. Pandan essence would work too.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreSfouf (Semolina Turmeric Cake)Semolina flour and turmeric give this simple cake a sunny hue and nutty flavor.5-Minute Chocolate Mug CakeYes, it's a shortcut in a microwave.
