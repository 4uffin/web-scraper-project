It packs in caffeine from the matcha and a bright tang and dose of vitamin C from the mango while making your weekday breakfast as simple as opening the container, grabbing a spoon, and digging in. Depending on your desired portion size, this makes enough to last the entire length of the work week, but we find the assembled puddings are best consumed in 4 days or less.There’s some liberty to be had too—any milk or alternative milk will work, the honey can be omitted if you’d rather it be less sweet, and toppings like shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or granola are encouraged. While ceremonial-grade matcha will always yield the most vibrant green and smoothest taste, culinary-grade is perfectly fine here. For the fruit, we found Dole frozen mango produced the best results, sweet and thick as custard.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s February IssueWe’ve got make-ahead breakfasts, a happy fridge salad, and one-pan dinners.ChevronChevronRead MoreCoconut Tempeh LarbThis riff on the Laotian classic comes together in 20 minutes.Dark Chocolate Flax BarkCrunchy, seedy flax crackers get topped with dark chocolate and a showering of sea salt for the ultimate sweet and salty snack.Mango BreadThis sunny mango bread is ultra-moist and bursting with tropical flavor; the loaf is topped with a tangy mango-lime glaze that sets to a glossy finish.Matcha-Berry Frozen YogurtFroyo for one, made in a blender and topped with a crackly magic shell.Hummingbird CakeOur spin on the beloved classic, featuring pineapple jam and cream cheese frosting.Summer Berry Stovetop CrispThis no-oven-needed crisp can be made with almost any fresh berry (we’d avoid raspberries) and comes together within 45 minutes.Quick Butter-Braised Tomatoes and DumplingsStore-bought dumplings, fresh tomatoes, butter, and soy sauce simmer away for dinner in a flash.Coconut Chicken Katsu With Smashed CucumbersThese crispy cutlets feature a coconut-breadcrumb coating and sriracha mayo.
