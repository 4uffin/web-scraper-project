This hearty stovetop dish combines ground turkey (not turkey breast, which can turn dry and crumbly), creamy white beans, and a blend of spices for a cozy, one-pot meal you’ll want to make time and again. Unlike slow-cooker or shortcut recipes, this version is made in a Dutch oven (or other heavy, large pot) in just over an hour, making it perfect for weeknight dinners or meal prep.The addition of cocoa powder and cinnamon in turkey chili may strike some as unusual. But the inclusion draws a direct link to Mexican mole sauces, where the bitter, fruity, and smoky notes of chocolate and the spicy, warm flavor of cinnamon contribute complexity without sweetness. The cocoa also lends the sauce a deep, long-simmered color, turning the tomatoey broth brick red. Topped with Cotija cheese, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of lime, it’s comfort food with a bright, fresh finish.Tips and variations:Protein swaps: Ground chicken or pork can be used as a substitute for the ground turkey in this easy chili recipe.Beans: We like creamy cannellini beans here, but any canned white beans, such as Great Northern or navy beans, will do.Vegetables: Add green or red bell peppers with the onions, or stir in some frozen chopped spinach at the end. These are easy ways to introduce some extra nutrients to your chili that will have minimal impact on the flavor.Spice level: If you like spicy chili, leave all the seeds in the jalapeños (or choose a hotter green chile, such as a serrano). Looking for something milder? Remove them. Not sure? Leave the seeds out. You can always adjust at the end with a dash of cayenne pepper or hot sauce.Garnishes: Trade Cotija for Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese; add diced avocado, crushed tortilla chips, chopped green onions, fresh diced tomatoes, store-bought fried shalllots, or whatever makes you excited to start eating.Serving suggestions: Spoon your white bean turkey chili over turkey or chicken hot dogs, load up a baked sweet potato, or serve with a side of cornbread for dunking.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryOur 33 Best Chili RecipesBecause a big bowl of hearty chili is always warming and satisfying.ChevronChevronRead MoreHalloumi No-Meat BallsShredded Halloumi cheese stars in these meatless meatballs, a worthy vegetarian substitution that adds savory richness of its own.Crispy Chicken QuesadillasSpiced chicken, charred peppers, and gooey cheese—these never-soggy quesadillas are a favorite for a reason.A Better QuesoReal cheddar cheese meets charred green chiles in our best recipe for queso.
