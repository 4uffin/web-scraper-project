Scallions and a copious amount of cilantro bring a cooling vegetal quality and oil thickens the sauce to a mayo-like richness as it blends. Don’t shy away from trying the sauce with a serrano, rather than jalapeño, chile. The creaminess of the avocado masks much of the heat and all that remains is a welcome warming tingle.Starting with an unheated nonstick pan and a slick of oil is the formula for shatteringly crisp fish skin. Use this technique with other skin-on fish fillets for failsafe results every time. This creamy (but dairy-free) sauce is also sublime served with seared or roasted chicken (either thighs or breasts).Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in AugustLike crispy salmon with avocado sauce and peach-blueberry pie.iconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit*’s Sports IssueWe’ve got chocolate-date bran muffins, sheet-pan chicken souvlaki, and salmon with sizzle nut salsa.ChevronChevronRead MoreTomato AguachileJuicy peak-season tomatoes make the perfect plant-based swap for aguachile.Soy-Glazed Salmon BowlsSaucy, soy-honey salmon—cut into cubes to speed up the cooking process—makes a savory topping for a quick weeknight bowl.Spicy Salmon Hand RollsSpicy tinned salmon (or tuna!) is a fast track to flavor in these simple hand rolls—particularly when mashed with some oil from the can and a slick of mayo.Beet-Salmon Salad With Horseradish YogurtCooked beets, flaked salmon, and an array of crunchy vegetables crown a bed of spicy horseradish yogurt in this hearty salad.Air-Fryer Sea Bass With Dilly Potato Chip CrustCrushed potato chips (mixed with a bit of mayo) make a delightfully crispy and nostalgic-tasting topping for flaky white fish.Sheet-Pan Salmon With Rice Cakes and KimchiA comforting dinner of chewy rice cakes, punchy kimchi, bok choy, and perfectly flaky salmon made entirely on just one sheet pan.Green Chutney ChickenCilantro and a handful of basic spices brings vibrant green color and rich flavor to broiled chicken thighs.
