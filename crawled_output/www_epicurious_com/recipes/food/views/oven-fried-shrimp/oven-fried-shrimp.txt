In this recipe for mayo-and-panko-coated shrimp, Kewpie does two things: First, it replaces the usual egg dip since it has so much yolk. Second, as the mayonnaise heats up in the oven, so does the oil in it, which ends up frying the shrimp and giving the panko crust an irresistible crunch. The result is a snack that’s too easy to pop one after another.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreWampanoaug Clam FrittersThe clams’ natural briny sweetness serves as a surprising foil for the tender fritter batter—just be sure to pull off the tough outer coating of the siphon.Spicy Honey Orange Shrimp (Xiang La Fengmi Xia)A satisfying weeknight dinner from Tiffy Chen.
