The key is a batch of spicy, garlicky cashews, sizzled in hot oil and then poured into a sieve to keep them crisp and crunchy. The hot oil that streams through blooms the aromatics held in the bowl below: fragrant ginger and sliced scallion whites, which become the base of a slick tahini sauce.Because you’ll use a good amount of the starchy noodle cooking liquid to loosen the sauce, too much seasoning in the water can easily tip the finished product over into too salty territory. Season the pot of boiling water very lightly—and use more cooking liquid than you think you’ll need in the sauce, as it’ll continue to thicken as it sits.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App This WeekLike Spanish garlic shrimp and carrot cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreSmoky Brown-Butter PastaSmoky brown-butter pasta is a pantry-friendly, grown-up version of beloved buttered noodles.
