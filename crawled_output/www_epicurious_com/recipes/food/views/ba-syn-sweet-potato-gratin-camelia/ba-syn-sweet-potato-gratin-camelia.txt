Slightly sweeter than other varieties, Japanese sweet potatoes have a naturally starchy, buttery texture that adds luxurious body without extra fuss. (In a pinch, standard sweet potatoes or garnet yams will work just fine.) And skipping the mandoline slicer and all that layering means minimal prep time.You’ll spread the potato mixture into a casserole dish before finishing it off with a scattering of cheese and a final flourish of chives and nori. Namba’s sweet potato gratin delivers golden brown, crispy edges with layers of savory umami and creamy richness, making it an easy, flavor-packed side dish worthy of any holiday feast.Chef’s Note: Japanese sweet potatoes can be found in most well-stocked grocery stores or international markets. They have a slightly sweeter flavor than their orange-hued counterparts and boast a starchier, denser texture; if you can’t get your hands on them, a standard sweet potato will work just fine.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreGrilled Purple Sweet Potato SaladCharred purple potato salad with mayo, lemon, and soy is smoky, creamy, and designed to be the star of any summer picnic or barbecue.Ruffled Mushroom Pot PieTopping a classic mushroom pot pie with crunchy, scrunched-up phyllo takes the comfort food classic from good to great.Sheet-Pan Pierogies and BeetsA flavorful one-pan meal featuring baked pierogies, roasted beets, and a poppy seed dressing.
