MeekerArrowJump To RecipeSave StorySave this storyPrintCabbage is the unsung hero of the winter kitchen—available anywhere, long-lasting in the fridge, and super affordable. It is also an excellent partner for pasta. Caramelizing the cabbage in butter creates a deep sweetness and silky texture, with the denser portions of the leaves retaining a bit of juicy crunch.Here, spicy Calabrian chiles add a contrasting kick of heat; look for them in a jar in the condiment section of the grocery store. Add them late in the cooking process so their flavor doesn’t fully permeate the whole dish but rather creates little pops of heat and acidity in each bite. The recipe calls for 1 tsp., which is a moderate amount; if you’re a hothead, increase that amount.Note: Slice up a few peperoncini and add them to the sauce when you add the Calabrian chiles; they’ll contribute a nice acidity and a bit of a sauerkraut flavor.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreSpaghetti With Poblano Chile SauceMexican pasta probably isn’t something you’ve thought about before, but this poblano sauce may have you rethinking your devotion to the red variety.Pasta Alla MezcalThis marinara sauce is great tossed with any pasta for a quick and easy weeknight dinner that will leave you thinking, “Why didn’t anyone try this sooner?”Stir-Fried Phở Noodles With BeefThis dish is not only a quick meal option but also a practical way to use leftover phở noodles when you’re out of broth.Halloumi LasagnaIn this lasagna, soft layers of pasta and béchamel are interspersed with a rich tomato sauce laden with hearty Mediterranean vegetables.Angel Hair BibimguksuGochujang creates a sauce that delivers the perfect balance of spice, tang, and sweetness.Berberger PastaThis comforting cheeseburger-inspired pasta from Kiano Moju is bolstered by berbere spice.Charred Vegetable RagùThis sauce is slightly magical.
