A shiny chocolate ganache and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt make it look bakery-worthy, but it’s surprisingly simple—just a few bowls, a whisk, and no mixer required.The crumb stays moist for days thanks to the combination of melted butter and oil—don’t be tempted to make swaps. Chocolate can have a drying effect on baked goods, and the oil is vital to maintaining the right texture. Unsweetened cocoa (preferably Dutch-process) and coffee bring an intense roasty depth that deepens overnight, making this an excellent make-ahead dessert option. Instant espresso powder stirred into hot water is an acceptable substitute for the brewed coffee if that makes this bake easier for you. Sour cream’s richness gives the cake a luxurious mouthfeel, while a full tablespoon of vanilla rounds out the rich chocolate flavorThe thin, glossy glaze—just dark chocolate, butter, and a pinch of salt—runs down the sides in elegant rivulets, setting firm but sliceable. Whether you serve it as a birthday centerpiece or a mid-afternoon treat, this might just be the best chocolate cake recipe you ever bake.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery43 Fall Desserts to Bake Right NowLike an easy-fancy pear tart, a decadent caramel-apple cheesecake, crinkly ginger-molasses cookies, and more.iconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in AugustLike crispy salmon with avocado sauce and peach-blueberry pie.ChevronChevronRead MoreSuper-Moist Yellow Cake With Rich Chocolate FrostingThis easy yellow cake recipe yields a cake that’s remarkably fluffy and moist.5-Minute Chocolate Mug CakeYes, it's a shortcut in a microwave.
