The trick to making this a one-pan affair is to use shelf-stable gnocchi (the kind found in the dried pasta section) instead of the fresh variety for this recipe. The latter are less resilient and tend to fall apart and become gummy, so save them for your more traditional cooking applications. These weeknight wonders become perfectly tender when pan-fried, requiring no boiling at all to reach their ideal selves. You’ll start there, then build your sauce all in the same pan: white wine, chicken stock (or vegetable, if you so choose), garlic, capers, and plenty of fresh lemon hit all the right notes of beloved piccata in a meat-free package. It’s a bright, bold, filling dinner that comes together in no time and results in just one dirty skillet.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryAll the Recipes From *Bon Appétit’s* Restaurants IssueWe’ve got vinegar chicken with figs, gnocchi piccata, and a corn cake.ChevronChevronRead MoreShrimp Scampi PastaWith lightning-quick shrimp and an easy garlic butter sauce, this crowd-pleasing pasta builds flavor fast.Smoky Brown-Butter PastaSmoky brown-butter pasta is a pantry-friendly, grown-up version of beloved buttered noodles.
