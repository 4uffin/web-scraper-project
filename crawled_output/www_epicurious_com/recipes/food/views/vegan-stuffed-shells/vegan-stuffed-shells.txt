The shells are filled with a wonderfully savory, lightly tangy concoction based on raw cashews. You can assemble it a day or two in advance and bake it right before serving. Be sure to find jumbo shells for this, not those labeled “large.”Buy raw (unroasted, unsalted) cashews online in bulk and store them in the freezer, which preserves the freshness so essential for getting this and other mixtures to be luscious and creamy.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsThe 19 Best Cookbooks of 2024We asked a panel of chefs and food writers which titles stood out to them most this year.*Desi Bakes*, *Justine Cooks*, and More Cookbooks We Loved in OctoberAt home, our editors are making vegan stuffed shells, puttanesca salmon, and more from these nine books.ChevronChevronRead MoreSpicy Cashew Scallion NoodlesThis saucy noodle recipe gets its crunch from fiery, garlicky toasted cashews.Cilantro Pesto PastaThis vibrant cilantro pesto recipe blends blanched herbs, Cotija cheese, garlic, and toasted pepitas.
