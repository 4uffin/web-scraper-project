Sweet, savory, and luxuriously dressed in butter, wine, and stock, they’re an easy holiday side dish that looks as impressive as it tastes. Former BA editor Claire Saffitz swears by serving these glossy shallots at her family’s Thanksgiving dinner, but they’re just as perfect alongside roast chicken, roast beef, or even a celebratory vegetarian main course. With only 20 minutes of cooking time, this caramelized shallots recipe strikes the ideal balance of elegance and ease—making it a dish you’ll want to repeat year after year.Tips and variationsTo peel shallots, slice off the tip and trim the root just enough so the shallot still holds together. Run the tip of a paring knife down one side of the papery skin, just deep enough to cut through the outer layer. Use your fingers or the side of the knife to lift the cut edge at one corner, then peel away the top layer.Swap chicken broth for vegetable stock to make this dish vegetarian-friendly and the butter for a nondairy butter substitute to make them vegan-friendly.Add a splash of balsamic vinegar, sherry vinegar, or red wine vinegar at the end for extra brightness and a tangy punch.Add a sprig of fresh rosemary or thyme to the simmering shallots for a fragrant touch.Serving suggestionsServe these caramelized shallots as a Thanksgiving side dish with roast turkey or glazed ham.Deglaze the sauté pan with the liquid from cooking 12 oz. rigatoni or buccatini; then make shallot pasta with the caramelized alliums and tons of Parmesan.Spoon them over creamy mashed potatoes, polenta, or risotto for a gluten-free alternative to gravy.Toss with roasted vegetables or sautéed green beans and top with crispy fried onions for a twist on your favorite holiday casserole.Use leftovers to top grain bowls, sandwiches, salads, or pizzas.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreBeurre BlancThis velvety white wine sauce imparts tangy, rich flavor to everything it touches.Vinegar Chicken With FigsA weeknight-friendly chicken dinner with two kinds of vinegar, dried figs, and a rich sauce.
