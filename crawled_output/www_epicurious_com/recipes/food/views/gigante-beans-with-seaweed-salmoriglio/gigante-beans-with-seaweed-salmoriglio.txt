In this version, after simmering its umami goodness into a pot of creamy beans, kelp is used as the base of the sauce. There’s a lot of olive oil in this recipe. The oil first simmers with the beans and is then skimmed off to be used in the sauce to ensure all the flavors are perfectly integrated.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreCharred Vegetable RagùThis sauce is slightly magical.
