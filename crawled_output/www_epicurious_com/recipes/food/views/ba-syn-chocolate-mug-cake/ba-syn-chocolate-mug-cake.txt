Think tiny ingredient lists, laid-back techniques, and results so delicious you’ll text home about them.Having a good, reliable mug cake recipe memorized should be considered an essential life skill. Imagine all the ways your life could be improved by this almost-instant dessert: PMS? Mug cake. Impromptu celebration? Mug cake. Rough breakup? Mug cake. Netflix and chill? Mug cake. Late-night chocolate craving? Mug cake. Successful potty training session? Mug cake. Stirring a handful of ingredients in a big coffee mug and microwaving it, only to have actual cake in under 5 minutes, is a modern miracle we should all celebrate.A few things to keep in mind: Make sure your mug is at least 12 oz. to allow the cake batter to rise—no one’s here for mug cake overflow. Also, note that this cake is cooked at 50% power, which helps ensure even cooking. This easy recipe was tested in a 1200W microwave; cooking times may vary based on your microwave’s power output.With a flavor that lies somewhere between a warm brownie and chocolate birthday cake, this single-serve chocolate mug cake recipe is also adaptable. The cake mix itself is dairy-free, and you could use a gluten-free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour if you’re feeding someone with a sweet tooth and a gluten allergy. You should also feel empowered to dress it up in whatever way suits the occasion. It’s rich and fudgy, making it the perfect base for a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. A spoonful of Nutella or peanut butter melting on top, or a dusting of powdered sugar wouldn’t be remiss either.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreJoojeh KebabA take on Persian joojeh kebabs, these grilled saffron yogurt chicken thighs with herby labneh are vibrant, flavorful, and perfect for your next cookout.Pasta Alla MezcalThis marinara sauce is great tossed with any pasta for a quick and easy weeknight dinner that will leave you thinking, “Why didn’t anyone try this sooner?”Rye, Cranberry, and Dark Chocolate CookiesThis cookie is an unintended “celebrity.” It’s one of very few cookies that customers ask for specifically upon arrival at Mokonuts.Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Spaghetti)Spaghetti is a common variation in modern Thai cooking. It’s so easy to work with and absorbs the garlicky, spicy notes of pad kee mao well.Golden Mushroom Soup With Orzo & a Pat of ButterThis is the type of soup that, at first glance, might seem a little…unexciting. But you’re underestimating the power of mushrooms, which do the heavy lifting.Our Favorite French Onion SoupCaramelized onions, melty Gruyère, and a deeply savory broth deliver the kind of comfort that doesn’t need improving.White Bean Turkey ChiliA dash of cocoa powder adds depth and richness to the broth of this easy turkey chili.Charred Vegetable RagùThis sauce is slightly magical.
