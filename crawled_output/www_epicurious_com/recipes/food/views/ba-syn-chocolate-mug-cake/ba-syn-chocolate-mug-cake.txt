Think tiny ingredient lists, laid-back techniques, and results so delicious you’ll text home about them.Having a good, reliable mug cake recipe memorized should be considered an essential life skill. Imagine all the ways your life could be improved by this almost-instant dessert: PMS? Mug cake. Impromptu celebration? Mug cake. Rough breakup? Mug cake. Netflix and chill? Mug cake. Late-night chocolate craving? Mug cake. Successful potty training session? Mug cake. Stirring a handful of ingredients in a big coffee mug and microwaving it, only to have actual cake in under 5 minutes, is a modern miracle we should all celebrate.A few things to keep in mind: Make sure your mug is at least 12 oz. to allow the cake batter to rise—no one’s here for mug cake overflow. Also, note that this cake is cooked at 50% power, which helps ensure even cooking. This easy recipe was tested in a 1200W microwave; cooking times may vary based on your microwave’s power output.With a flavor that lies somewhere between a warm brownie and chocolate birthday cake, this single-serve chocolate mug cake recipe is also adaptable. The cake mix itself is dairy-free, and you could use a gluten-free flour blend in place of the all-purpose flour if you’re feeding someone with a sweet tooth and a gluten allergy. You should also feel empowered to dress it up in whatever way suits the occasion. It’s rich and fudgy, making it the perfect base for a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. A spoonful of Nutella or peanut butter melting on top, or a dusting of powdered sugar wouldn’t be remiss either.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreChocolate PieReminiscent of a classic diner dessert, this chocolate cream pie offers pure comfort in a cookie crust.Mississippi Mud CakeThis cake was created from thrift and was supposedly named after its appearance, which reminded people of the muddy Mississippi River bottom.Heavenly Halva CakeServe a thick slice for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up.Grasshopper BrowniesThese decadent brownies feature a sweet, minty topping complemented by a rich dark chocolate ganache and mini chocolate chips for added texture.Ube Milk CrinklesWith the sweet and nutty flavor of ube, these cookies taste like they’ve been dunked into a glass of milk.Fudgy Chocolate Bundt CakeGlossy, intensely chocolaty, and spiked with coffee and sour cream, this Bundt is the ultimate all-purpose dessert.3-Minute Chocolate Cream Cheese FrostingConsider every birthday cake, brownie, and cupcake covered (in this frosting, that is).Black Sesame Tofu “Basque” CheesecakeThere are many things that appeal about a Basque cheesecake—it's crustless (one less job) and is meant to look “rustic” with its wrinkled and jagged sides.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
