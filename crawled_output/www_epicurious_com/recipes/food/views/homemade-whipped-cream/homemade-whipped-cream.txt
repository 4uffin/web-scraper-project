Originally paired with a Sachertorte in Rick Rodgers’ Kaffeehaus, it highlights Vienna’s café tradition, where fresh whipped cream tops everything from coffee to cake—and even savory soups. Perfect for pumpkin pie, hot chocolate, ice cream sundaes, strawberry shortcake, and more, this easy whipped cream recipe delivers fluffy, stable, consistent results.To make the best whipped cream, start with pasteurized (not ultra-pasteurized) heavy cream containing 36%–40% milk fat, and be sure to chill both the cream and mixing bowl well. We prefer powdered sugar over granulated sugar—its touch of starch helps the cream hold its shape longer—and recommend choosing brands that use tapioca instead of cornstarch for the best texture. Vanilla is the most traditional flavoring, but you can always branch out. For stabilized whipped cream that lasts (like for cream pie), try food editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s trick: a dash of instant pudding mix.If you’re still learning how to make whipped cream, use a balloon whisk for the most control or a hand mixer with a whisk attachment. Avoid high-speed stand mixers as they can easily lead to over-whipped cream. For a cloudlike topping, stop at soft peaks, or whip to stiff peaks for dramatic swirls. If you do end up overbeating your freshly whipped cream, there’s an easy fix: Just fold in a little more liquid cream to bring it back.This recipe was adapted for style from ‘Kaffeehaus’ by Rick Rodgers.
