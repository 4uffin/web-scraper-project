During summers as a kid, I couldn’t get enough of Schwan’s Silvermint bars (now Yelloh!)—­those mint ice cream bars coated in rich chocolate were my ultimate treat. Even in high school, I’d jazz up boxed brownies with crushed mints on top for that extra minty kick. To this day, if Andes mints are offered after a meal at a restaurant, you can bet I’m grabbing a handful on the way out. Chocolate and mint speak to my soul.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreUbe Milk CrinklesWith the sweet and nutty flavor of ube, these cookies taste like they’ve been dunked into a glass of milk.London Fog BrowniesYes, brownies can—and should—be made with white chocolate.Chocolate PieReminiscent of a classic diner dessert, this chocolate cream pie offers pure comfort in a cookie crust.Birthday BrookiesThis half-brownie, half-bar-cookie hybrid is a fun dessert that gets the ultimate birthday party treatment with colorful sprinkles.Heavenly Halva CakeServe a thick slice for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up.5-Minute Chocolate Mug CakeYes, it's a shortcut in a microwave.
