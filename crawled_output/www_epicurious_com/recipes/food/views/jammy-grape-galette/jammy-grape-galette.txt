So often relegated to a jumbled fruit salad (where they end up lost in a sea of other flavors and textures), or worse yet, frozen into a flavorless, tooth-tingling “dessert,” grapes deserve another look. Even the most average supermarket varieties—use black or red in a galette for their color—come alive when roasted with a bit of sugar and seasoning. They caramelize on the outside while the innards go jammy. Technically in season from summer to fall, the grapes available at the farmers market are truly special. They can be tart-skinned and fizzy inside, coated with cloudy (edible!) yeast, as small as blueberries, or oblong like doll-size eggplants. All are welcome in this galette, so long as they’re seedless. Finished with sesame (seeds and toasted oil), it tastes eerily like a PB&J sandwich.Note: This recipe makes enough dough for 2 standard galettes (or 4 tiny ones per disk of dough). You'll only need 1 standard disk, so make one galette today, then freeze a disk of dough for later.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery23 Galette Recipes to Make for Easy Desserts (and Dinners)Like apricot-almond, cheesy mushroom, cannoli-inspired, and more.16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreSour Cherry and Campari GaletteThis Campari-spiked galette features the herbal aperitif, tart cherries, and floral citrus zest and is perfect for those who prefer bitter to sweet.Almost Cannoli GalettesCannoli and sfogliatelle require complex technique—making them is best left to the professionals.
