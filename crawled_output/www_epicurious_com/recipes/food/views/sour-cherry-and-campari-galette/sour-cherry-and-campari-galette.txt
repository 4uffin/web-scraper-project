This Campari-spiked galette is one. The herbal aperitif, tart cherries, and floral citrus zest all point to the fact that this is a pastry for those who prefer bitter to sweet. Scarlet-red sour cherries—completely different in flavor from their sweet magenta counterparts—tend to pop up at grocery stores and farmers markets for a month or so in summer. When you find them, buy as many pounds as your tote bag can fit, round up a few friends, and get to work pitting.Note: This recipe makes enough dough for 2 standard galettes (or 4 tiny ones per disk of dough). You’ll only need 1 standard disk, so make one galette today, then freeze a disk of dough for later.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGallery23 Galette Recipes to Make for Easy Desserts (and Dinners)Like apricot-almond, cheesy mushroom, cannoli-inspired, and more.16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreJammy Grape GaletteWe don’t bake with grapes as often as we should.
