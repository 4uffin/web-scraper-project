The magic lies in the flaxseed: As they swell and plump in hot water, they release a starchy gel that’s the key to holding the base together as it sets in the oven. The result is ethereally light and shatteringly crisp. Topped with a rippled layer of dark chocolate that allows roasted nuts and airy freeze-dried fruit, plus a light dusting of flaky sea salt, to cling to each bite. It’s the ideal balance of sweet, salty, and crunchy. Plus, the flaxseed and sunflower seeds offer a significant source of fiber, protein, and antioxidants. You can make a big batch, break it up, and store it in an airtight container in the fridge to snack on anytime you’re in need of a pick-me-up.Although the cracker might look finished after about 30 minutes or so, resist the urge to take it out early. It needs the full time to properly crisp up. It will smell deeply toasted and the edges will lift slightly when it is done.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MorePistacharoosThis festive take on Midwestern scotcheroos swaps out peanut butter for pistachio cream, giving the bars a beautiful hue and bold flavor.Flourless Chocolate-Orange CakeParty-ready and delightfully simple, this fudgy cake will become your go-to hosting dessert.Matcha-Berry Frozen YogurtFroyo for one, made in a blender and topped with a crackly magic shell.Roasted Tofu Grain Bowls With Miso-Tahini SauceThis vegetarian bowl is as colorful as it is hearty: brown rice and quinoa, roasted tofu and broccolini, avocado, cabbage slaw, and a turmeric-spiked dressing.Tiramisu Basque CheesecakeTwo of our all-time favorite desserts, now in one new classic.Blueberry Muffin Baked OatmealA nourishing, cozy breakfast you can throw together with fresh or frozen berries.Millionaire’s ShortbreadOur ultimate version of the luxe chocolate-caramel bars.Matcha-Mango Chia PuddingFeaturing a bright layer of sweet mango, these colorful chia puddings are worth waking up early for.
