Once these mayo-covered slices of tofu are slid into the oven, the oil in the condiment ends up frying the tofu, no eggy dredge or deep-fry needed. The tofu is crunchy on the outside, in part thanks to a panko-studded exterior, and squishy-in-a-good-way on the inside. This dish comes together in 20 minutes, making it a strong contender for a busy weeknight dinner—the tofu can be roasted alongside a tray of vegetables for a complete meal.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreMicrowaved Tofu With Butter and Soy SauceThis custardy and comforting tofu comes together in minutes, all thanks to your microwave.
