Once these mayo-covered slices of tofu are slid into the oven, the oil in the condiment ends up frying the tofu, no eggy dredge or deep-fry needed. The tofu is crunchy on the outside, in part thanks to a panko-studded exterior, and squishy-in-a-good-way on the inside. This dish comes together in 20 minutes, making it a strong contender for a busy weeknight dinner—the tofu can be roasted alongside a tray of vegetables for a complete meal.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreMicrowaved Tofu With Butter and Soy SauceThis custardy and comforting tofu comes together in minutes, all thanks to your microwave.
