I've always been into salads that com­bine raw and roasted elements—they result in a great texture (and flavor) contrast. Here, roasted peaches and com get stirred into a simple cucumber salad spiked with lime juice and scallions. Chorizo plays nicely with the salad, thanks to its spice, but you could use any other type of sausage you favor, even plant-based versions.NOTES: Since the peaches get roasted, you can use unripe ones in this prep­aration. After roasting they'll be soft and slightly caramelized. Store leftover sausage and com salad in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in JulyLike herby chicken kofta meatballs and grilled Peruvian chicken.16 Standout Cookbooks for Summer 2025Here are the titles we’re keeping cracked in our own kitchens—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreSpice-Grilled Pork ChopsA pinch of sugar in the spice rub ensures picture-perfect grill marks with layers of flavor.Zucchini, Pea, and Bulgur PilafThis fragrant salad uses bulgur wheat as its base, an endlessly versatile, slightly chewy grain that’s very popular throughout the eastern Mediterranean.Chipotle-Citrus RibsTender, well-glazed, and just spicy enough, these ribs are the ultimate grill-out food.
