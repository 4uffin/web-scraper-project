But what you’re likely underestimating is the power of mushrooms (naturally high in umami, a fever dream of mixed textures, visually dazzling in all their shapes and sizes), which are doing most if not all of the heavy lifting here. Technically this recipe can be done with all button or crimini mushrooms, but I can’t say it will look or taste as good as it does with a mix of the more exotic types, such as oyster, maitake, or chanterelle. The simplicity of this soup means you do have to be vigilant about seasoning (especially if you’re so bravely using water instead of broth), salting, peppering, and adjusting with fish sauce as you go. That said, I really enjoy the monk-like restraint of the mushroom-garlic-water magic that occurs (with a fish sauce assist, of course), creating a broth that is delicate and earthy, evoking a very good, robust mushroom tea.EAT WITH: In keeping with the monastic theme, I like to eat this soup alone (often for lunch), but for dinner (maybe even with others), I think a giant piece of toasted bread or baguette to dunk into the broth would be nice.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreSaucy Mushroom Stir-FryAny variety of mushroom will love this glossy, tangy sauce.Smoked Mackerel UdonChewy noodles, tinned fish, and hardy greens in an umami broth.Steamed Vegetables With Miso-Ginger DressingThis assertive dressing is the perfect complement to tender, delicate steamed vegetables.Skillet Gnocchi With Leeks and BaconAn elegant, satisfying dinner in under 30 minutes.Frijoles de la Olla Ramen (Mexican Stewed Beans)Traditionally, this Mexican staple is simmered for hours in an olla, or clay pot.
