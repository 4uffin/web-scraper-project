Pair it with your favorite burger recipes—like In-N-Out-style smash burgers—or slather it on roast beef or turkey sandwiches. Use it in place of any condiments in your deviled eggs or egg salad, or tuck it into a pita with chicken shawarma or ground beef kebabs. Serve it as a dipping sauce for french fries, onion rings, chicken tenders, a soft pretzel, or fresh vegetables.Of course, you can adjust the portions of our house special sauce, transforming it into your own secret sauce. Use Dijon mustard instead of yellow. Swap the dill pickle juice for sweet pickle relish for a chunkier Thousand Island dressing–like consistency, or try apple cider vinegar or white vinegar for a sharper tang. Add a pinch of cayenne pepper for kick, or cracked black pepper or dash of sriracha for milder spice. Store the hamburger sauce in an airtight container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsiconGalleryThe Most-Saved Recipes in the Epicurious App in JulyLike herby chicken kofta meatballs and grilled Peruvian chicken.iconGallery25 Ways to Cook With Ketchup Burgers and fries can step to the side.This Condiment Makes Crispy Potatoes and Moist Chocolate CakeHere are 25 ways to use it.Why Ketchup Shouldn't Be America's Favorite CondimentWe can do better, people.Why Mayo Is Always the AnswerHow this simple creamy sauce will solve all your problems.The Blueprint for Our Not-So-Secret Burger SauceA closely-guarded sauce recipe is the hallmark of any classic burger.
