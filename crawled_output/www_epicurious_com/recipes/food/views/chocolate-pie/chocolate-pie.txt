It delivers richness with a hint of nostalgia (especially if you grew up loving old-fashioned diners), and the creamy filling will surely satisfy any lover of chocolate pudding.That filling balances intense chocolate flavor by using both unsweetened and dark chocolate. You can use chocolate bars or chocolate chips, but choose a high-quality brand like Guittard or Scharffen Berger, if possible. Can’t find good unsweetened chocolate? Substitute 6 Tbsp. unsweetened cocoa powder plus 2 Tbsp. refined coconut oil. Once you get the custard on the stovetop, stay close—it thickens fast. Whisk constantly, making sure to get into the corners of the pan for a smooth, lump-free filling.Originally made with Nabisco’s Famous Chocolate Wafers (now discontinued), the pie shell can be made with Oreo cookie crumbs, Goya’s Chocolate Maria Cookies, or any chocolate graham cracker. But if you’re short on time, a store-bought chocolate cookie crust works too.We like a whipped cream topping here, but you’ll have some leftover egg whites, which you can transform into meringue if preferred. You can make this chocolate pie a day ahead—just wait to add the topping until right before serving, and garnish with chocolate shavings or extra crushed cookies if you’re feeling fancy.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking TipsThis Chocolate Pie Was the Best Breakfast I’ve Had All MonthFrom *Gourmet*, this recipe has been a reader favorite for decades.iconGallery53 Sensational Spring DessertsRhubarb crumb bars, anytime lemon cake, pies for the first fruits of spring, and more sweets to brighten your days.iconGallery53 Chocolate Desserts for the Cocoa-ObsessedWhat do we want?
