Some customers do not even notice the other cookies on display! As I said to Dorie when she was featuring this cookie in her New York Times Magazine article (thanks Dorie!), the origin of this cookie is quite random.I wanted to make cookies with rye flour. Then I needed a contrast, a sour component and texture, or a “crunch”—thus, cranberries and poppy seeds. Dark chocolate rounds things out with its bitterness. This cookie is not a flashy celebrity. I rather find her a classy, discreet type, but it’s up to you to judge.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleRead MoreUbe Milk CrinklesWith the sweet and nutty flavor of ube, these cookies taste like they’ve been dunked into a glass of milk.London Fog BrowniesYes, brownies can—and should—be made with white chocolate.Grasshopper BrowniesThese decadent brownies feature a sweet, minty topping complemented by a rich dark chocolate ganache and mini chocolate chips for added texture.Heavenly Halva CakeServe a thick slice for breakfast or an afternoon pick-me-up.Chocolate PieReminiscent of a classic diner dessert, this chocolate cream pie offers pure comfort in a cookie crust.Mississippi Mud CakeThis cake was created from thrift and was supposedly named after its appearance, which reminded people of the muddy Mississippi River bottom.Birthday BrookiesThis half-brownie, half-bar-cookie hybrid is a fun dessert that gets the ultimate birthday party treatment with colorful sprinkles.Nankhatai (Semolina Shortbread)These cookies are gently sweetened and perfect with a cup of tea.Since 1995, Epicurious has been the ultimate food resource for the home cook, with daily kitchen tips, fun cooking videos, and, oh yeah, over 33,000 recipes.FacebookXPinterestYouTubeInstagramAbout UsThe Epicurious AppNewslettersSubscription FAQsGift GuidesCareersPress CenterAdvertisingMastheadUser AgreementPrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAccessibility HelpCondé Nast Store© 2025 Condé Nast.
