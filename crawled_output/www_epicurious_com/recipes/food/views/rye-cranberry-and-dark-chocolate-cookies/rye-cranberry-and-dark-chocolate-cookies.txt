Some customers do not even notice the other cookies on display! As I said to Dorie when she was featuring this cookie in her New York Times Magazine article (thanks, Dorie!), the origin of this cookie is quite random.I wanted to make cookies with rye flour. Then I needed a contrast, a sour component and texture, or a “crunch”—thus, cranberries and poppy seeds. Dark chocolate rounds things out with its bitterness. This cookie is not a flashy celebrity. I rather find her a classy, discreet type, but it’s up to you to judge.Recipe notesBack to topTriangleSee Related Recipes and Cooking Tips14 Standout Cookbooks for Fall 2025Here are the titles we’re cooking from at home—recipes included.ChevronChevronRead MoreStir-Fried Phở Noodles With BeefThis dish is not only a quick meal option but also a practical way to use leftover phở noodles when you’re out of broth.Spaghetti With Cabbage, Pancetta, and Calabrian ChileCabbage is the unsung hero of the winter kitchen—available anywhere, long-lasting in the fridge, and super-affordable.
