To deliver thorough guides to technique, best practices for the kitchen, and how-tos for keeping your equipment and home sparkling clean, we consult a range of industry professionals, including food scientists, chefs, and bartenders. We prioritize working with a diverse network to ensure a wide scope of backgrounds and experiences are represented.Product TestingOur Commerce editors are committed to making sure readers are equipped with the most up-to-date information regarding the best tools and appliances on the market. We diligently cross-test as many products as we can to determine what will go the distance. Our product testing is conducted in home kitchens—not professional kitchens—to more accurately simulate how they’ll be used once you make your purchase.Products that have gone through this testing process, like our favorite kitchen scale, receive the Epi Tested and Reviewed stamp. Our preferred cleaning equipment, like these leave-no-streak polishing cloths, gets the Clean Enough stamp. Our annual Kitchen MVP Awards showcase our favorite products of the year.Testing is conducted independently; we do not receive compensation for featuring or reviewing products. If you make a purchase from a link provided on our website, we may receive an affiliate commission.Recipe DevelopmentEpicurious is your destination for recipes and the information you need to help you get the most out of your home kitchen. Our original recipes are developed with the home cook in mind, and they’re geared toward solving your weeknight dinner quandaries, providing you with classic versions of regional favorites, satisfying your sweetest cravings, and offering you a drink whenever you need one.Our test kitchen editors are constantly researching, developing new flavor combinations and cooking techniques (Have you tried Jesse Szewczyk's Pasta With No-Cook Zucchini Sauce?), and bringing them to the team for discussion. From there, a recipe goes through multiple rounds of tastings and analysis to ensure the flavor, cooking method, number of ingredients, and tools required are just right. When an editor feels confident about a recipe, it’s cross-tested by another cook, final edits are made, and it’s sent to our photo team for its turn in the spotlight.Grilled Peruvian Chicken With Green Sauce

These recipes are not always reviewed by our test kitchen team and may be edited for style.Research and Fact-CheckingThe content published by Epicurious is held to the highest journalistic standards. Our copy editors, director of research, and a team of in-house librarians and legal counsel guide the thorough research and accuracy of every recipe, article, and video we publish. We also review all content for sensitivity and inclusivity, ensuring people of all cultural backgrounds are represented and respected.We made a lot of buttermilk biscuits to determine the best flour for baking.
