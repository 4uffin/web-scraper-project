And, for the first time ever, most of this week. While it used to be literally just a “day,” this year’s Amazon Prime Day Prime Day begins on Tuesday, July 8 and ends Friday, July 11.How do I access Amazon Prime Day deals?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronWhile Amazon Prime Day is a chance to save a few bucks, it does cost money to participate. Currently, you need to have an Amazon Prime membership to access the limited-time pricing on sale items, and that will set you back $14.99 per month or $139 per year. (Note: If you’re between the ages of 18 and 24, you can qualify for a half-price discounted membership). However, if you’re a regular Amazon shopper there’s a good chance a Prime membership will pay for itself. Prime membership comes with a host of benefits, including free one-day, two-day, and even same-day delivery on many items, plus access to unlimited grocery delivery (for an additional monthly fee). You can also access Prime Video streaming content, Kindle e-books, plus non-Amazon perks like Grubhub+, which offers $0 delivery fees and other savings.What discounts are available for Prime Day 2025?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronPrime Day discounts vary, but in the past we’ve seen upwards of 50% or 60% off major brands and popular products.
