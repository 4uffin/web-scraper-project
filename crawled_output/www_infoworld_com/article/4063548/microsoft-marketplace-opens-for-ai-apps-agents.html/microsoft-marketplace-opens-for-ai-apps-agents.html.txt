Microsoft has launched Microsoft Marketplace, a unified storefront website for AI apps, agents, and enterprise solutions to boost AI adoption.
Unveiled September 25, the marketplace is intended for scenarios where the adoption of AI agents requires a mix of in-house and third-party tools. The marketplace offers a secure, scalable mechanism for customers to try out and buy solutions, whether on the web or directly within Microsoft products, according to the company.
Featuring an AI Apps and Agents category, the marketplace simplifies enterprise purchasing by uniting apps and agents with solutions such as Copilot and Azure AI Foundry in a single, governable platform. Software developers and partners can use the marketplace to reach more customers and simplify selling apps, agents, and other enterprise solutions. Uniting Microsoft’s AppSource and Azure Marketplace web storefronts, Microsoft Marketplace has a unified taxonomy and a combined catalog, with search and category-based recommendations. The marketplace supports purchasing both on the web and directly in-product.
Microsoft described the marketplace as empowering “frontier firms”—organizations the company sees as re-shaping how innovation is scaled, work is orchestrated, and value is created. The marketplace is described as an extension of the Microsoft Cloud. More than 3,000 AI apps and agents are newly available directly on the marketplace and in Microsoft products, from Azure AI Foundry to Microsoft 365 Copilot. Provisioning is done within a user’s Microsoft environment via industry standards such as Model Context Protocol (MCP). Among the Microsoft Marketplace launch partners are Adobe, Atlassian, IBM, LexisNexis, and SAP.
