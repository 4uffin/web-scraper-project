Conflicting opinions on the ROI of AI

Are AI projects a success? The answer depends on who is funding the study. It’s no surprise that enterprises are struggling to align resources with expectations.

When it comes to evaluating the return on investment for cloud-based artificial intelligence projects, the discussion tends to swing between two extreme viewpoints—either enterprises are raking in big gains or they’re stuck in a never-ending quagmire of false starts and expensive lessons. Google Cloud’s latest study, “The ROI of AI 2025” paints a hopeful picture, claiming that early adopters of AI agents are seeing returns within the first year. However, this optimism starkly contrasts with a well-cited MIT report that declared 95% of AI projects fail to generate ROI. Which perspective reflects the truth?
In my view, both studies have validity, but context is everything. Google Cloud, of course, has a vested interest in showcasing AI success stories to support its cloud ambitions. At the same time, MIT’s findings likely reflect the cold reality for a majority of enterprises, many of which lack the resources, funding, and talent to achieve substantive success in AI. Let’s unpack this seeming contradiction and explore the real challenges.
Early adopters find ROI, but at a cost
One of the most compelling points in Google Cloud’s study is that early adopters (companies dedicating serious resources to AI implementation) are significantly more likely to see measurable ROI. According to the study, 74% of all surveyed organizations reported ROI from generative AI projects within their first year. For the lucky 13% of respondents identified as early adopters, returns are even more tangible. This group typically devotes at least 50% of its AI budget to deploying AI agents and has embedded AI deeply across its operational processes.
The study also highlights the areas where early adopters are realizing the most success: customer service, marketing, security operations, and software development. These organizations are not merely automating processes but redesigning business operations around AI—a significant distinction from companies dabbling at the surface level.
Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: Devoting 50% of your AI budget to one type of application, as the early adopters in the study do, is impractical for most enterprises. The vast majority are navigating resource constraints that include insufficient funding, inadequate talent, and overburdened IT systems. It’s no wonder so few enterprises find success with AI when limited buy-in, poor strategy, and fragmented execution remain pervasive roadblocks.
A skeptical eye on Google’s report
It’s worth mentioning that Google Cloud has released this report at a time when generative AI is at the center of intense business hype. With competition among tech giants in the AI space at an all-time high, Google isn’t publishing such studies as a neutral party. The company undoubtedly has a strong incentive to portray AI as a proven success, conveniently sidestepping instances of enterprises struggling or failing.
This bias is important to consider in light of the MIT report, which bluntly states that 95% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI. That figure isn’t an outlier in the broader discourse around AI. Time and time again, surveys have shown that many enterprises investing in AI face setbacks stemming from poor planning, unrealistic expectations, and the challenges of scaling initiatives across their organizations.
From my own experience working with enterprises, I can confirm these struggles are very real. While some companies tout their success stories, these tend to be the exceptions rather than the rule. Limited talent pools, undefined goals, and a lack of foundational data infrastructure are persistent hurdles. Many organizations are trying to run before learning how to walk. They would be better served by first mastering data management or setting realistic project milestones.
Ambition versus capability
The Google Cloud study and its upbeat conclusions raise a vital point: AI success favors the bold. Organizations willing to prioritize AI as a cornerstone of their operations, invest heavily, and rethink their processes are positioning themselves for greater payoffs. That said, this approach isn’t without risk, particularly for organizations that lack mature IT capabilities or access to the vast resources of tech giants or well-endowed startups. The reality is that AI success requires a rare blend of factors. Consider the prerequisites:
Budgets large enough to cover ongoing investments
Access to top-tier talent skilled in machine learning or natural language processing
A robust existing data ecosystem
Executive buy-in across all levels of the organization
Only a minority of enterprises meet these criteria. For the rest, dabbling in AI often turns into a frustrating exercise in overpromising and underdelivering.
A particularly difficult challenge is the scarcity of AI expertise. Hiring and retaining skilled data scientists or engineers is out of reach for many organizations, especially smaller players that can’t compete with salaries at big tech companies. Without the right people to guide strategy and execution, AI efforts often fail before they even begin.
Take studies with a grain of salt
One study cannot define the ultimate truth about the ROI of artificial intelligence—it depends entirely on who’s conducting the research, the sample of enterprises surveyed, and the vested interests at play. For example, Google Cloud has a clear incentive to highlight AI success stories that directly bolster its own cloud computing strategy. Meanwhile, academic studies like MIT’s prioritize rigor but can produce an overly grim portrayal due to strict definitions of ROI or failed projects.
As businesses, we must interpret these studies through a critical lens rather than accept them as gospel. What works for one company may not work for another, especially across different industries, budgets, and maturity levels in the digital transformation journey.
Hard truths and cautious optimism
AI is often described as a transformative technology, but transformation is anything but easy. For all the early adopters claiming swift wins and bragging about revenue growth, far more companies are still grappling with the fundamentals. Success, it appears, is very unevenly distributed. From where I’m sitting, enterprises are still in the early chapters of their AI journeys, and most are discovering how difficult it is to achieve meaningful results quickly. The challenges are daunting, ranging from data privacy, system integration, and ongoing investments in AI initiatives.
To me, the optimistic conclusions from studies like Google’s don’t erase the fact that AI success—in the cloud or otherwise—is still rare. Achieving ROI demands immense effort, vision, and commitment, and many enterprises simply aren’t equipped to overcome their internal barriers. Ultimately, businesses need to set realistic expectations about AI and move forward cautiously. Hype won’t close the gap between ambition and implementation, but thoughtful planning, achievable timelines, and resource allocation might. AI could become transformational eventually, but widespread success is likely to remain rare—at least for now.
