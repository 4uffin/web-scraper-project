GitHub Copilot app modernization now is generally available via agentic AI tools for Java and .NET, Github said. For both platforms, the intentions are to help modernize applications and move them to the Azure cloud.
In a blog post on September 23, GitHub said that developers using Copilot can access applications, apply code transformations, containerize services, and patch builds, all in days rather than months. App modernization support includes modernization reports, automated code transformations, containerization for cloud deployments, build patching, and dependency updates. These capabilities streamline upgrades and migrations, to help teams modernize existing Java and .NET projects faster.
Copilot app modernization features an AI assistant for modernizing applications faster, with a streamlined end-to-end migration processes from assessment to deployment. With GitHub Copilot app modernization, developers focus more on writing new code while AI handles the work of updating legacy code. The results are already showing up, according to GitHub owner Microsoft, with customers cutting timelines, reducing effort, and unlocking faster paths to innovation.
