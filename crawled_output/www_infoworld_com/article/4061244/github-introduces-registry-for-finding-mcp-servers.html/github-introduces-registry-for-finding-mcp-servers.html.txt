GitHub MCP Registry makes Model Context Protocol servers with GitHub repos discoverable from Visual Studio Code.

GitHub has launched the GitHub MCP Registry, a curated registry of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with repositories on GitHub.
The GitHub MCP Registry was launched September 16 with MCP servers from the likes of Figma, Postman, HashiCorp, and Dynatrace included in the registry. Developers are provided with a single, trusted environment to find the right tools faster and contribute to a more open, interoperable ecosystem on GitHub, the company said. Whether building with GitHub Copilot, agents, or any AI tool that speaks MCP, the registry is the place for developers to find what is needed, GitHub said.
The registry is intended to assist developers who have had difficulty finding MCP servers scattered across numerous registries and repositories and buried in community threads across the open-source ecosystem. With GitHub already home to most MCP servers, the GitHub MCP Registry makes them dramatically easier to discover, explore, and use, helping developers find the right tools faster and contribute to a more open, interoperable ecosystem, GitHub said.
The launch of GitHub MCP Registry follows the recent general availability of the GitHub MCP Server, which enables AI assistants to work directly with GitHub data through structured tool interactions. MCP enables integration of AI capabilities with other tools and services to enhance the development experience by providing context-aware AI assistance, GitHub explained.
