How to spin Python’s challenges into AI goldPython’s AI development ecosystem is hard to beat, but the path to choosing and using the right tools can be rocky. Make the most of Python’s AI dominance by learning which tools to use and how to use them—not just for good, but for the best.
Tiobe: Python popularity boosted by AI coding assistantsAs if you needed further proof artificial intelligence is Python’s A-game: Recent analysis from the Tiobe language index shows AI coding assistants taking Python’s growth to the next level.
Chat with data the easy way in R or PythonAre you sick and tired of SQL? Try using the querychat chatbot library to mine datasets using natural language instead. Run a data-analysis experiment with NFL game stats, then view the results in a shiny dashboard.
Amp your Python superpowers with ‘uv run’Here’s a wizardly Python skill for you: Execute Python packages and libraries with a single uv utility command, even if they’re not already installed.
