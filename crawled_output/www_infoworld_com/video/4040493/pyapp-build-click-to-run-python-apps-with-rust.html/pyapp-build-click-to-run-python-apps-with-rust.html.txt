Episode 229 PyApp: Build click-to-run Python apps with Rust

Python
OverviewPython programs aren't easy to bundle up into click-to-run installable packages. No native way to do this exists, and the various third-party solutions like PyInstaller have major shortcomings and quirks. The PyApp project, written in Rust, aims to make it easy to build standalone executables for Python apps, although you need to be familiar with the Rust toolchain to use it. This video shows a simple example of PyApp in action, and details some of its features and limitations.Register Now
