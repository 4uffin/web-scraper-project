Episode 234 Python 3.14’s live debugging interface
Sep 23, 20254 mins
Python
OverviewAmong the powerful new features in Python 3.14 is a new interface for attaching a live debugger to a running Python program. You can inspect the state of a Python app, make changes, single-step through it — all without having to modify the source code ahead of time to work with a debugger. This video shows a simple example of how it can be used, either with Python's own pdb debugging module, or with code you write for your own custom debugging scenarios.Register Now
