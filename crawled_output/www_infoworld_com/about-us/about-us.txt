About Us
About Us
InfoWorld covers software development, cloud computing, data analytics, and machine learning tools and technologies for an audience of information technology (IT) professionals, from CTOs and cloud architects to software engineers, developers, and data scientists.
In the past decade, two major forces—open source software and cloud computing—have completely transformed how businesses and their IT organizations operate. Software has become central to nearly every business activity, from manufacturing and the supply chain to ecommerce and customer interactions, and most business software is now being developed using open source code and being run on public cloud infrastructure.
Through news, analysis, expert commentary, hands-on reviews, and technical guides, InfoWorld strives to help both IT decision-makers and technical professionals understand and use the most important new technologies for building the next generation of business applications on modern cloud platforms.
