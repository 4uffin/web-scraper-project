pgdbtemplate – fast PostgreSQL test databases in Go using templates
#testing
#go

#performance
Tired of waiting for your test suite to slowly create and migrate PostgreSQL databases over and over again? If you're writing data-intensive applications in Go, you know this pain well. Your tests spend more time setting up the database than actually testing your logic.
What if I told you there's a way to make this process 1.5x faster, use 17% less memory, and scale effortlessly to hundreds of test databases?
Meet pgdbtemplate – a high-performance Go library that leverages PostgreSQL's native template databases to revolutionise your testing workflow.
The Problem: Traditional Database Setup is Slow
The classic approach for integration tests looks like this:
func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {
// 1. Create new database
// 2. Run all migrations (CREATE TABLE, INDEX, FK...)
// 3. Run your test
// 4. Drop the database
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Steps 1 and 2 repeat for every single test, consuming precious time and resources. The more complex your schema, the slower it gets.
The Solution: PostgreSQL Template Databases
PostgreSQL has a brilliant built-in feature: template databases. You can create a "golden" database with all your migrations applied once, and then use it as a template to create new, identical databases in milliseconds.
pgdbtemplate automates this process, providing a simple API that fits seamlessly into your existing test setup.
Get Started in Minutes
First, install the library:
go get github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Here's how you use it in your test suite:
package main
import (
"context"
"testing"
"github.com/andrei-polukhin/pgdbtemplate"
)
var templateManager *pgdbtemplate.TemplateManager
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
ctx := context.Background()
// Set up the template manager once
connStringFunc := func(dbName string) string {
return "postgres://user:pass@localhost/" + dbName
}
provider := pgdbtemplate.NewPgxConnectionProvider(connStringFunc)
migrationRunner := pgdbtemplate.NewFileMigrationRunner(
[]string{"./migrations"},
pgdbtemplate.AlphabeticalMigrationFilesSorting,
)
tm, _ := pgdbtemplate.NewTemplateManager(pgdbtemplate.Config{
ConnectionProvider: provider,
MigrationRunner:
migrationRunner,
})
// Initialize template with migrations (one-time operation)
tm.Initialize(ctx)
templateManager = tm
code := m.Run()
// Cleanup everything
tm.Cleanup(ctx)
os.Exit(code)
}
func TestUserRepository(t *testing.T) {
ctx := context.Background()
// Each test gets its own isolated database instantly!
testDB, testDBName, err := templateManager.CreateTestDatabase(ctx)
if err != nil {
t.Fatal(err)
}
defer testDB.Close()
defer templateManager.DropTestDatabase(ctx, testDBName)
// Run your test logic on a fresh database
repo := NewUserRepository(testDB)
user, err := repo.CreateUser("test@example.com")
// ... your assertions
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Real Performance Gains: The Numbers Don't Lie
We ran extensive benchmarks comparing traditional database creation versus the template approach. The results speak for themselves:

The template approach maintains consistent performance regardless of schema complexity, while the traditional approach gets progressively slower as you add more tables, indexes, and constraints.
Key Features
⚡ Blazing Fast: Create test databases in milliseconds instead of seconds
🔒 Thread-Safe: Perfect for parallel test execution (t.Parallel())
🔄 Dual Driver Support: Works with both database/sql + pq and pgx
🧹 Automatic Cleanup: Comprehensive cleanup of test databases
🐳 Testcontainers Ready: Easy integration with containerized PostgreSQL
📊 Migration Flexibility: Support for file-based and custom migration runners
How It Works Under the Hood
Initialization: Creates a template database and runs all migrations once
Testing: For each test, creates a new database using CREATE DATABASE... TEMPLATE
Cleanup: Drops test databases and finally cleans up the template
The magic happens in step 2 – PostgreSQL handles template database copying at the filesystem level, which is dramatically faster than running SQL migrations repeatedly.
Advanced Usage
Using with testcontainers-go
func setupTemplateManagerWithContainer(ctx context.Context) error {
pgContainer, _ := postgres.RunContainer(ctx,
testcontainers.WithImage("postgres:15"),
postgres.WithDatabase("testdb"),
// ... other config
)
connStr, _ := pgContainer.ConnectionString(ctx, "sslmode=disable")
provider := pgdbtemplate.NewStandardConnectionProvider(
func(dbName string) string {
return pgdbtemplate.ReplaceDatabaseInConnectionString(connStr, dbName)
})
// Create and use template manager as before
// ...
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Connection Pooling Options
Configure your connections for optimal performance:
// For database/sql + pq
provider := pgdbtemplate.NewStandardConnectionProvider(
connStringFunc,
pgdbtemplate.WithMaxOpenConns(25),
pgdbtemplate.WithMaxIdleConns(10),
)
// For pgx
provider := pgdbtemplate.NewPgxConnectionProvider(
connStringFunc,
pgdbtemplate.WithPgxMaxConns(10),
pgdbtemplate.WithPgxMinConns(2),
)
