Subscribe here.Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump took a chaotic, and at times, incoherent turn through the 80th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, upending US policy on the Russia-Ukraine war in the process.What just happened? Trump started his day with a bizarre speech to the assembled world leaders, at points attacking other countries, efforts to address climate change, and the United Nations itself. The address was noticeably light on policy and heavy on false claims.Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, Trump made at least two potentially significant pronouncements: NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets that violate their airspace, and Ukraine should push to reclaim all of its original territory from Russia.What’s the context? Trump has been inconsistent about US policy on the war. Last month, he hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, that was widely perceived as a win for the Russian president; today’s statement marks an about-face on Trump’s stated vision for an end to the war.Why does this matter? Trump has intermittently appeared disillusioned about his relationship with Putin, including in remarks today with French President Emmanuel Macron. Coupled with his answer on how NATO countries should respond to airspace violations and his new position on the war, this would be the most aggressive stance of his presidency toward Russia — if he sticks with it.The LogoffThe email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Trump changes his mind on even the biggest policy questions, and he’s often subject to the opinions of the people he last spoke with (in this case, Zelenskyy and European leaders supporting him, like Macron). That makes covering what he says in major moments like these difficult, but his pronouncements can have serious real-world implications. Whether they constitute a meaningful policy shift remains to be seen.And with that, it’s time to log off…Fat Bear Week has begun!
