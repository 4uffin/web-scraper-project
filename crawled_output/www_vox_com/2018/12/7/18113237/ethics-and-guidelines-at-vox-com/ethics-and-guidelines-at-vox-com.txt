Vox StaffUpdated Apr 8, 2020, 3:23 PM UTCShareGiftAs a part of Vox Media, Vox.com adheres to the Vox Media Editorial Ethics & Guidelines and to the following:Vox has evolved and will continue to evolve as it builds a portfolio of modern editorial networks and partners across multiple mediums driving the future of journalism and entertainment. However, our commitment to the core values of integrity and passion will never change.We believe in working with talented people, the judgment of our staff, and the transcendent importance of serving the interests of our audiences. Through the Vox Media editorial guidelines we aim to give our teams clear guidance about what to avoid and the public knowledge of what to expect. Simultaneously, we recognize the impossibility of reducing the complexity of real life to a simple checklist or rulebook and encourage conversation and dialogue with colleagues and supervisors about concrete situations as superior to trying to craft an ethics policy that would address every conceivable dilemma.As the needs of our newsrooms and audiences change, our guidelines will adapt in kind to ensure that Vox Media’s work is always deserving of our audiences’ trust.Advertising and Revenue PartnershipsVox Media is home to editorial networks and the businesses that enable them. In no case, however, do these efforts interfere with the integrity of our editorial teams or the content they create.This includes Vox Media divisions responsible for selling advertising and editorial sponsorships on our properties; advertising across the publisher-led marketplace Concert; branded content created in partnership with our in-house advertising practice Vox Creative; and podcast advertising across the Vox Media Podcast Network. In each case, the work of these independent groups is clearly marked or announced as “Advertiser Content” or “Presented by” a sponsor as applicable.Some of our content contains affiliate links, which means we will receive a commission for purchases made via those links; when our editorial or commerce teams have manually added affiliate links to our articles, we will include a disclosure within the content.Advertisements do not necessarily reflect the views of Vox Media or our editorial teams.Conflicts of Interest, Activism and Disclosures Vox Media’s newsrooms have complete editorial independence and our editorial staff and contributors take their beats seriously. Any editorial team member or contributors will be recused from a story and/or publicly disclose conflicts of interest when editorially appropriate. This may include a personal or family relationship, personal financial investment, or relevant political activity. Our staff will also refrain from demonstrating or donating to causes that could compromise their journalistic coverage of an issue.Some Vox Media editorial networks accept financial contributions from individual audience members and funding from grant organizations. However, this financial support does not affect editorial independence.Vox Media also has a number of investors, which are publicly disclosed here.Corrections, Updates and DeletionsVox Media makes every effort for content to be completely accurate upon publication. If a correction is required, however, we are transparent and update a story if new information either adds to or invalidates the original story. We will issue corrections for a factual error or if a typo in the copy could cause audiences to misunderstand the story.We almost always leave all editorial content live, with notes and corrections as needed. We may, in rare instances, remove content from our websites, social media pages, or related platforms for legal reasons or extenuating circumstances. Removal will never be at the direction of, or be influenced by, our advertisers and will always be approved by editorial leadership.Gifts and Giveaways We do not accept gifts or other consideration from companies as a condition or incentive to write a review or story, whether favorable or unfavorable. Any gifts accepted will be of minor value and in no way compromises or guarantees editorial coverage of the event, product, or service.Occasionally, Vox Media will conduct contests and giveaways for our audiences. We will post rules for each contest and giveaway that will be binding for those who decide to participate. While giveaways or contests may be sponsored by an advertiser or partner, they are not, and should never be, considered endorsements of the entities involved or their products.Social MediaVox Media hires our editorial employees for their strong, expert voices, and values their ability to build positive communities and influence on our platforms and their own. We implore all staff to wield their tool/voice with extra care. Behavior on social media is a reflection of both one’s personal and professional self and, as a voice of Vox Media and our editorial networks, we expect social posts to apply the same journalistic integrity required in our editorial content.Note: our editorial guidelines leave no room for indulging harassment on social media. All Vox Media employees are encouraged to access and review our protocol for reporting online abuse.SourcingVox Media obtains news and content from a variety of sources. Some of our sources do not wish to be named, and we grant anonymity when we know our sources to be credible and reliable, and that their story would otherwise not be told. We make best efforts to confirm the veracity of the information provided by anonymous sources and will not include any information we have not thoroughly vetted. It is our policy not to pay sources.Vox Media ValuesOur Vox Media Values remain our cornerstones at all times. In an industry that is constantly evolving, we will thrive on change and innovate to improve. We will always hold ourselves and our teammates to high standards and build an environment that cultivates passion, benefits collaboration, and respects all voices and identities.See More: archivesMost PopularEurope is readying for direct conflict with RussiaWhy voters keep shrugging off Trump’s corruptionTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordThe right wants Charlie Kirk’s death to be a “George Floyd moment”The Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
