<p class="has-text-align-none">As a person firmly ensconced in middle age — 57 percent of the way through life, to be precise, if <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">government actuarial tables hold</a> — I have begun to notice certain things not working quite as well as they used to. Specifically, my eyes and my ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can ask my family: My hearing is not what it once was, and not just because I have been known to hear selectively from time to time. As for my eyes, I had them zapped with lasers back in 2005, but the increasing squint as I read tells me the warranty may have expired on that. And I’m not alone — about 14 percent of Americans between 45 and 64 <a href="https://heardothan.com/hearing-resources/facts-about-hearing-loss/" data-type="link" data-id="https://heardothan.com/hearing-resources/facts-about-hearing-loss/">experience</a> hearing loss in some way,<strong> </strong>while over 90 percent of those over 45 <a href="https://www.aoa.org/news/clinical-eye-care/diseases-and-conditions/for-128-million-us-presbyopes-doctors-of-optometry-can-provide-treatment-options?utm_source=chatgpt.com">suffer from presbyopia</a>, or the declining ability to focus on near objects. Globally, the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss?utm_source=chatgpt.com">projects</a> that by 2050 nearly 2.5 billion people will have some form of hearing loss.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But I have good news for fellow aging people (which is, well, all of us eventually.) Our digital gadgets are increasingly being designed with features that can help users overcome both the usual sensory declines of age and more severe disabilities and diseases. From Apple AirPods that can act as <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/?afid=p240%7Cgo~cmp-22996441833~adg-190367116732~ad-774766374133_kwd-756942568996~dev-c~ext-~prd-~mca-~nt-search&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-airpods-noncore_p3-airpodspro3_hearinghealth-airpodspro3_hearinghealth_091925-AirPodsPro3-AirPodsPro3-Hearinghealth-airpods+hearing+aids">inexpensive hearing aids</a> — and now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/personaltech/new-airpods-language-translation-feature.html">on-the-go translators</a> — to the growing ubiquity of <a href="https://news.med.miami.edu/how-continuous-glucose-monitors-are-changing-diabetes-care/">continuous glucose monitors</a> for diabetics, some of the most promising uses of consumer tech involve propping up our failing organic meat-sacks.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can you hear me now?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest consumer tech nudge from “nice to have” toward “health tool” happened last year: the US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software?utm_source=chatgpt.com">authorized</a> the first over-the-counter hearing-aid software. It’s called “Hearing Aid Feature,” and it allows adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to use compatible AirPods as OTC hearing aids. Given that even over-the-counter hearing aids <a href="https://audiologists.org/resources/hearing-wellness/how-much-are-hearing-aids?utm_source=chatgpt.com">can run from several hundred dollars to over $1,000</a>, a roughly $200<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3">pair of AirPod Pro 2s</a> can feel like a bargain. For more complex hearing loss, the audiologist still matters, but the FDA’s endorsement lowers stigma and price barriers for millions who won’t (or can’t) get clinical devices. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And those same buds now speak multiple languages. Apple’s new <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/translate-in-person-conversations-dev9c215ca94/web">Live Translation</a>, part of this fall’s “Apple Intelligence” rollout, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/personaltech/new-airpods-language-translation-feature.html">pipes two-way conversation translation</a> straight through your AirPods when paired to an iPhone. In demos and early reviews it’s already proven good enough for everyday use, translating in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, with more languages promised. For anyone who’s ever tried to navigate a medical form, a parent-teacher conference, or a pharmacy pickup in a second language, this is less a party trick and more a social ramp.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Public places are catching up, too. Auracast — Bluetooth’s broadcast audio standard — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/628533/android-16-auracast-hearing-aid-support?utm_source=chatgpt.com">turns loud, crowded public venues</a> into accessible listening zones. Instead of borrowing sticky headsets at a theater, you can join a labeled audio stream with your own earbuds or hearing aids. Google has baked Auracast support into Android 16, and Pixel phones are starting to make “join broadcast” feel as normal as hopping on wifi. That’s dignity, not just decibels.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visionary</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our eyes are, if anything, almost as bad as our ears: at least 2.2 billion people around the world <a href="https://www.who.int/Publications/i/Item/9789241516570?utm_source=chatgpt.com">have some form of vision impairment</a>. And our addiction to digital devices is actively making that worse: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830598">Studies have found</a> that a daily 1-hour increment of digital screen time is associated with 21 percent higher odds of myopia, or nearsightedness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if phones are the cause of at least some of our vision problems, they have added features that can help people with vision impairment navigate the world. On the iPhone, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph35c335575/ios?utm_source=chatgpt.com">built-in Magnifier app</a> harnesses the device’s camera to do some beautifully practical things; Door Detection announces a door’s distance and how it opens; Point and Speak reads the labels on physical buttons when you aim your finger, decoding all too often inscrutable kiosks. And while automatic translation requires iPhones advanced (and expensive) enough to use Apple Intelligence, these are stock features, not add-ons.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over on Android, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-december-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Google’s Lookout app</a> now goes beyond “what’s in this picture?” to truly useful follow-ups for the vision impaired. Image Q&amp;A lets you ask for details about an image and get spoken, more helpful answers, and Google says those descriptions are now powered by its newer Gemini AI models. That translates to daily autonomy: “Is this the blue shirt?” “What does the sign say?” “Where’s the submit button?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s my number?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The consumer-to-care transition is happening in chronic disease, too. Continuous glucose monitors — medical implants that track glucose levels — have been available for diagnosed diabetics for some time. But in 2024, the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cleared</a> the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor, Dexcom’s Stelo, for adults who don’t use insulin (which includes diabetics who control their illness with oral medication and people who may be pre-diabetic). A few months later, the medical devices company Abbott <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2024-06-10-Abbott-Receives-U-S-FDA-Clearance-for-Two-New-Over-the-Counter-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-Systems">won clearance</a> for two over-the-counter sensors: Libre Rio (specifically for adults with type 2 diabetes not using insulin) and Lingo (which is aimed more at the wellness crowd).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No prescription needed; just a phone and a sensor. For the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html">38 million Americans with diabetes</a> — and the much larger group with pre-diabetes — that makes it simple to see how breakfast or a walk affects your glucose curve. Just remember that data is not a diagnosis.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assisted living</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These new technologies don’t just represent more convenience —&nbsp;they could literally make people healthier. Take hearing assistance: A landmark NIH-funded randomized trial <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/hearing-aids-slow-cognitive-decline-people-high-risk?utm_source=chatgpt.com">found that in older adults</a> at higher risk, treating hearing loss slowed cognitive decline over three years. That doesn’t turn earbuds into dementia shields, but it does show the value of removing hurdles to hearing support. The same is true for diabetes, which requires lifelong management. Anything that makes that easier can help improve lives.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Progress is when people no longer need expensive specialty devices; they can get the same benefits from the polished, affordable things they already own. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or low-vision, managing conditions like diabetes, or just getting up there in years like me, that rewiring adds up to something radical: more agency with less hassle.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now if only someone could design an implant that would instantly locate my remote control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a deep human impulse to whittle reality down into familiar and self-flattering fairy tales.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We all gravitate toward information that validates our preconceptions and vindicates our in-groups. It is cognitively taxing to revise one’s model of the world. And it is emotionally uncomfortable to recognize fault in our allies or merit in our adversaries. So, we are all tempted to sand the jagged edges off events until they fit into ideologically convenient frames.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If this impulse is universal, however, liberals (such as myself) like to believe that we are less vulnerable to it. After all, we are the side that favors scientific inquiry over religious fundamentalism, universalism over ethnocentrism, and critical accounts of American history over jingoistic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives, by contrast, often recoil at moral complexity. And their leadership is unbound by any sense of fealty to the truth. Or so the progressive historian <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-13-2025">Heather Cox Richardson suggested</a>, in a recent Substack post.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Richardson’s account, McCarthyism taught the American right the political utility of shameless lies. By crafting mendacious and simplistic “us” versus “them” narratives — and repeating them ceaselessly — conservatives found that they could “construct a fictional world,” which many voters would unknowingly come to inhabit. Liberals in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html">reality-based community</a>” — to use a phrase made famous by the George W. Bush administration — might feel compelled to align their claims with discernible facts. But the American right, feels no such obligation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As an example of conservatives’ mendacity, Richardson cites the Trump administration’s attempt to pin Charlie Kirk’s assassination on the left. And not without reason: The White House’s brazenly dishonest propaganda about that tragedy does much to support Richardson’s portrait of the right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, shortly after decrying the GOP’s privileging of “narrative” over “facts,” Richardson wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">[I]n fact, the alleged shooter was not someone on the left. The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, is a young white man from a Republican, gun enthusiast family, who appears to have embraced the far right, disliking Kirk for being insufficiently radical. Rather than grappling with reality, right-wing figures are using Kirk’s murder to prop up their fictional world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Richardson’s post in fact deftly illustrates the hazards of tribalistic thinking and epistemic immodesty, just not quite in the manner that it intended.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When Richardson published her column on September 13, there was no sound basis for asserting that Robinson was “not someone on the left,” much less that he was a far-right extremist who’d killed Kirk for being inadequately reactionary. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">charging documents</a> released Tuesday indicate that Richardson’s narrative was false.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, that narrative was briefly pervasive within social media’s left-wing corners. In fact, the idea that Robinson was a proven reactionary became so widespread among liberals that ABC’s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (apparently) felt safe <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">paying it lip service</a> on Monday.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even after Tuesday’s revelations, a few left-wing influencers continued promoting <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/confronting-a-fuller-picture-of-charlie-kirks-killer-tyler-robinson-political-violence">the idea that Robinson opposed Kirk</a> from the right, explaining away evidence to the contrary with conspiracy theories.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The left’s embrace of comforting fictions about Kirk’s assassination is understandable. But it is also irresponsible and politically self-defeating. To truly inhabit the “reality-based community,” progressives must not merely spotlight the right’s fantasies, but stand more watchful guard against our own. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What we know about Tyler Robinson’s motive</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, authorities in Utah filed charges against Tyler Robinson for aggravated murder. Three pieces of evidence in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">indictment suggest</a> that Robinson objected to Kirk’s politics from the left:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Robinson’s mother told investigators that her son “had become more political and had started to lean more to the left — becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.” His mother also said that he had begun “to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders.”</li>
<li>Robinson had texted a confession to his roommate after the shooting, referring to the roommate as “my love” and saying of Kirk, “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”</li>
<li>Robinson’s parents told investigators that he had explained his crime to them in similar terms, saying that Kirk “spreads too much hate.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The indictment is not the last word on Robinson’s motivations (or, for that matter, his guilt). But nothing in the assembled evidence supports the narrative that Robinson was far-right.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How many progressives came to believe that Robinson was a “groyper”</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It isn’t hard to understand why progressives found it plausible that Robinson was a reactionary extremist. The alleged killer engraved his bullet casings with references to a bizarre array of memes, including one that <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme">mocks so-called furries</a> (adults who dress up in animal costumes during sexual encounters), and another that informed observers, “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These etchings recalled the nihilistic, anti-LGBT trolling often found on the extremely online right. And Charlie Kirk had his reactionary enemies: The white nationalist podcaster Nick Fuentes’s fandom — a community known as “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/groyper-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes-tyler-robinson">groypers</a>” — had declared <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/a-groyper-war-struggles-to-exert-influence-but-paves-the-way-for-other-bad-actors/">a war</a> on Kirk’s organization, Turning Point USA, for failing to uphold Fuentes’s explicitly racist vision of America First.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From the beginning, there were reasons to doubt that Robinson was a rightist. Most obviously, Kirk earned far more enmity from the left than the right. And one of Robinson’s bullet casings read, “Hey, fascist! Catch” (though, this could be dismissed as <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme">an arbitrary video game reference</a>).</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The moment we deem ourselves immune to ideological chauvinism and unreason, we become more vulnerable to both.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Given this initial collection of facts, progressives had cause for <em>entertaining</em> the idea that Robinson was a white nationalist, but none for asserting it as an established fact.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the “groyper” theory lacked a solid factual basis, however, it offered considerable psychological appeal. It is uncomfortable to accept that you share a worldview — or even, a few strong moral convictions — with perpetrators of terrible crimes. To avoid such discomfort, people often latch onto improbable narratives. To absolve MAGA of January 6’s mayhem, many conservatives embraced the theory that the riot was orchestrated by <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot">antifa</a> (and/or the FBI). To avoid grappling with atrocities committed in the name of a cause they supported, some on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/">far-left</a> decided that the October 7 attacks were a false-flag operation. To deny Israel’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461977/un-commission-report-israel-genocide-gaza">inhuman crimes</a> against the people of Gaza, its defenders tell <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/coleman-hughes-the-simple-truth-about">themselves stories</a> that attribute all culpability for the Jewish state’s violence to its enemies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think some progressives’ misplaced confidence in Robinson’s conservatism was rooted in a similar impulse (which is not to say that hasty assumptions about a killer’s motives are <em>morally</em> comparable to apologetics for genocidal violence). And the psychic appeal of the “groyper” theory enabled it to become common sense among substantial portion of progressives, such that the writers of <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> evidently felt comfortable insinuating that Robinson was a conservative.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump wants to have a fight about Robinson’s motive</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of Tuesday’s indictment, many progressives have abandoned the notion that Kirk was killed for being insufficiently racist (on Wednesday, Richardson <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-16-2025">retreated to the claim</a> that Robinson’s motive “remains unclear”). </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But a few on the left have tried to <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/confronting-a-fuller-picture-of-charlie-kirks-killer-tyler-robinson-political-violence">salvage</a> the “groyper” theory, in part by <a href="https://x.com/JoJoFromJerz/status/1968137869765365879">questioning the authenticity of Robinson’s text exchanges</a> with his roommate. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such conspiracism is not just intellectually bankrupt, but politically self-defeating.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration wants to use Kirk’s killing as an excuse for cracking down on progressive dissent. Its argument for that assault on free expression includes one apparent truth (that Kirk’s killer shared some of the left’s objections to his work) and a whole host of claims that are either blatantly false or wholly unproven (that Robinson was affiliated with progressive organizations, that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">political violence in America</a> comes exclusively from the left, that the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">Federal Communications Commission</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">has the legal authority</a> to police the offhanded remarks of comedians). </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is therefore in the administration’s interest to focus public debate on Robinson’s apparent motive. That is the subject they <em>want</em> to fight about — which is why they tried to get <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">Jimmy Kimmel fired</a> for his misguided intervention into that argument.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives must not get baited into a losing fight. We don’t need to deny the facts about Kirk’s killing to refute the administration’s broader narrative about that tragedy. Whatever Robinson’s motive, the left is responsible for <a href="https://www.alexnowrasteh.com/p/deadly-politically-motivated-violence">a small minority</a> of political violence in the United States in recent decades. And there is no evidence that Kirk’s alleged killer belonged to any organized progressive group, much less that his violence was directly abetted by the liberal foundations that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/vance-white-house-promise-to-crack-down-on-radical-left-lunatics-00564766">has promised to destroy</a>. On every point that actually has bearing on the policy response to Kirk’s death, the facts are on progressives’ side. We should focus on those realities. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, liberals must strive to avoid further lapses of epistemic humility in the future. In my view, the broad left is correct to believe that it has more respect for empirical truth — and comfort with moral ambiguity — than the right does. But this advantage is strictly relative. And the moment we deem ourselves immune to ideological chauvinism and unreason, we become more vulnerable to both.</p>

Kash Patel has had a long week.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kash Patel has had a long week.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The FBI director and frequent social media poster faced scrutiny for how he handled the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation, including from members of his own party. Conservative <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1966520299723366534">activist Chris Rufo posted on X</a>: “We would be wise to take a moment and ask whether Kash Patel has what it takes to get this done.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before he was President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, Patel was a lawyer and national security aide in Trump’s first term. Not only that, but he was a MAGA golden child, reported conspiracy theorist, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjWCnh42Sc4">big-time critic of the FBI</a>, wanting the headquarters shut down on day one, and reopened “the next day as a museum of the deep state.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel had several stumbles early on in the Kirk investigation, <a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1965903392934633587">posting on X</a> that the FBI had someone in custody, only for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-director-kash-patel-faces-scrutiny-inaccurately-saying-kirk-killer-had-been-2025-09-11/">officials in Utah to announce</a>, around the same time, that they were still looking for the suspect. He was then called to Capitol Hill to testify in front of the Senate and the House, where he spent two days <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/g-s1-88926/fbi-director-patel-testimony-congress">being grilled by lawmakers</a> about the Epstein files, among other things.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To make sense of Patel’s recent blunders — and why Trump is backing him anyway — <em>Today, Explained</em>’s Sean Rameswaram talked to Axios White House reporter <a href="https://www.axios.com/authors/mcaputo">Marc Caputo</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We&#8217;ve come to you today to ask you how happy the Republicans are with the job Kash Patel is doing. Clearly, Democrats on Capitol Hill, not very happy. How about Republicans?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The most prominent voice online criticizing Kash Patel&#8217;s performance was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5iFYziMiT1o">Chris Rufo</a>. Rufo had, like a lot of people, just really disliked the performative nature of Patel online. And there are a few other conservatives in the administration who shared the belief. They just think that Patel is a little too much on Twitter or on X or on social media and sort of not more of your traditional hang-back, don&#8217;t-say-too-much FBI director.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do they want to see Kash Patel doing as director of the FBI?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just catching more bad guys. The big thing that is animating the right broadly is the idea that there are a number of leftist groups and organizations who are funneling money to violent, disruptive protests and illegal activity. And those need to be investigated, busted up, and the perpetrators of these alleged crimes brought to justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are those who believe that the FBI has too many deep staters and more firings need to happen. What just happened prior to the murder of Charlie Kirk, there was a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/g-s1-87947/fbi-lawsuit-firing-retribution">lawsuit</a> filed by three former FBI agents who alleged that their firing was illegal and unlawful [that] portrayed Kash Patel as sort of bumbling in his job and not knowing what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s the sort of downside of the mass firings. The upside of the mass firings is that is what the conservative MAGA base wants. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, had sort of leapt to the fore with that. She got in office and dismissed a lot of people. Kash Patel hasn&#8217;t done as many firings, and in the MAGA mind, that has been a mistake.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A lot of people were worried that Trump was going to remake the FBI in his image, and that of course would be an image of not only a president, but a convicted felon. Has Kash Patel yet accomplished that or is that still to come or is it unclear?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh no, I think a lot of these agencies, bureaus, whatever you want to call them, they have career service employees who are harder to fire, harder to dismiss. They have their own culture, history, and institutions, and perhaps none as storied and as solid as the FBI. The ability to really change that is going to be difficult. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not happening, but I know that people in Patel&#8217;s orbit have bemoaned how difficult it is to change things. One of them told me it&#8217;s like an asylum over here. So the “deep state” — I&#8217;m putting that in air quotes — is still resisting the Trump attempt to take over.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So it sounds like Kash Patel has lots of static with various people in this administration, with various people in the base. Does he have allies?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the people who wanted Kash Patel to become FBI director was Charlie Kirk. He advocated for him. Kirk had a very close relationship with Donald Trump, was very involved in the transition. Really, the closest person to Patel is Rick Grinnell, who was an ambassador and then the acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#8217;s first term, who is now a special envoy, including to Venezuela. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He and Kash Patel have a very close and good relationship. That was probably the closest thing to his upper-level sponsor. I understand from one source that Trump [last week]<strong> </strong>went golfing with Kash Patel and a Newsmax personality. So there was sort of a bonding moment there on the links with the president, and from what I&#8217;m told, all went well.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And of course, it&#8217;s only that person at the top who matters in this administration. How&#8217;s Trump feeling about Kash Patel, in light of recent events in Utah, the hearings on Capitol Hill this week?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump likes a winner, and in Trump&#8217;s mind, they got the guy [who killed Charlie Kirk]. Kash Patel has made a good argument as to him owning a share of the responsibility or being able to claim credit for catching the suspect by releasing his photo early. And one of the things that you&#8217;ll look at and notice in conservative or right-wing press is a very clear and very smart campaign by Kash Patel and the various people at the FBI and his orbit to make sure that he&#8217;s getting credit for that. And who reads conservative media, conservative publications, and pays attention to conservative influencers? Donald Trump!</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Kash Patel doing that Donald Trump likes? It certainly can&#8217;t just be that he raised his voice a bunch of times at Adam Schiff and Cory Booker this week on Capitol Hill.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump likes his people engaged and active in the fight. When [New Jersey Democratic Sen.] Cory Booker comes out there and says, “Oh, you&#8217;re not going to be here much longer. You’re gonna get fired.” When Donald Trump hears something like that, “Oh, Cory Booker thinks he should go. Well, I guess I&#8217;m going to keep him.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then secondly, when Patel and Booker went at it, and there was a sort of shouting match and going back and forth, and he held his own. &#8230; Donald Trump likes that stuff. He wants people engaged in the fighting; he wants them to mix it up. He wants them to go after Democrats, counterpunch, and hit hard. And Kash Patel does that.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t suspended because of poor ratings. He wasn’t suspended because he crossed some ethical red line. He was suspended because the president of the United States decided to make an example of him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The supposed justification came on Kimmel’s Monday night show. “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said in his monologue. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There was little evidence at the time to think the shooter was a MAGA supporter, as Kimmel’s comment seemed to imply, and nothing we’ve learned since suggests otherwise. If anything, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/us/kirk-shooting-suspect-ideology-partner.html">evidence points in the opposite direction</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But democracies are supposed to absorb careless speech. Bad jokes, bad takes, even vile remarks are the price of a free society. And the whole point of the First Amendment is to take the government out of the business of deciding what we can and can’t hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">Zack Beauchamp</a> argued, Kimmel’s suspension represents a remarkably brazen attack on free speech. And if it succeeds in setting the precedent that presidents can use regulators to muzzle their enemies, we’re in a political emergency. Because free expression is more than a democratic value. It’s the foundation that makes every other value possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But none of what’s happening should surprise us. The same openness that allows dissent and satire is also what makes democratic societies vulnerable to demagogues who can exploit them — what my co-author Zac Gershberg and I called in our book on the subject the “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo146792768.html">paradox of democracy</a>.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So there will always be moments when a culture that prides itself on tolerating every kind of speech will eventually have to decide whether it also tolerates efforts to silence speech. This is one of those moments.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How democratic spaces can give way to antidemocratic forces</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we’re seeing in the Kimmel case has precedents that go all the way back to the dawn of democracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Athens, the open legal forum that allowed Socrates to question authority also gave his enemies the power to put him on trial for “corrupting the youth.” The very openness that made debate possible also created the space for repressive forces to weaponize the system against him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Weimar Germany, the explosion of film, radio, and print paved the way for new art and progressive ideas, but those same media were quickly turned into tools of mass propaganda by Joseph Goebbels, drowning democratic culture in authoritarian messaging.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US today, the regulatory framework designed to safeguard open broadcasting is being wielded to punish a critic of the president. And more broadly, the same wide-open information environment that underpins free expression has made it possible for MAGA and its allies to increasingly dominate the public square — amplifying conspiracy theories, overwhelming fact-based journalism, and eroding the very conditions for shared reality.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Steve Bannon openly bragged about “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flooding the zone with shit</a>,” exploiting the sheer volume of the open information environment to break the press. President Donald Trump’s continual <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/26/13417532/donald-trump-lies">torrent of lies</a> works the same way. And hostile actors abroad — from <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/12/17/18145075/russia-facebook-twitter-internet-research-agency-race">Russia’s troll farms</a> wading into the 2016 US election to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/china-is-using-tiktok-for-influence-campaigns-odni-says-00146336">Chinese disinformation campaigns</a> on TikTok sowing division today — have learned to infiltrate these same open channels to destabilize democracies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of us celebrated the collapse of media gatekeepers and the rise of a free-for-all, digital public square in the 21st century. In its early days, the internet was hailed as a democratizing force. But the same qualities that made it feel liberating — openness, access, immediacy — also made it ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no easy way to resolve this tension. Free expression is both democracy’s strength and its weakness.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How much do Americans truly value free expression?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the liberal imagination, free speech is a neutral principle that guarantees a fair contest of ideas, protecting all sides equally. The post-liberal right and MAGA Republicans treat it like a weapon. Speech is power, and judging by their rhetoric and actions this past week, they’re happy to police it when it serves their side.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From their perspective, this is all fair game. Liberals, they say, aren’t really committed to free speech either. They sat by as their allies on the left brought the hammer of repression on “incorrect” beliefs for the last decade or more. They feel justified in using state power the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s truth in this critique. The left has its own illiberal reflexes. Cancel campaigns, deplatforming, disinvitations — from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/03/middlebury-students-shout-down-lecture-charles-murray">Middlebury students</a> shouting down Charles Murray to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/media/new-york-times-tom-cotton-op-ed">New York Times staffers</a> revolting over an op-ed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html">Hamline University</a> dismissing an art-history professor for showing images of the Prophet Muhammad — the left has had its turn at enforcing orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the difference is that the right now wields the machinery of government to enforce their reflexes in ways Democratic administrations have not done in any comparable way. We’re not talking about sophomores at Wesleyan storming the quad for Palestine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the crucial distinction, and how we’ve arrived at this juncture, where institutions powerful enough to shape the public square are giving way to political pressure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what happened here. Nexstar — which owns roughly 200 stations across the country — and ABC didn’t even attempt to defend their own autonomy. They apparently calculated that fighting the government was too costly, especially with billions in merger approvals on the line. So they surrendered. And when institutions with that much power fold, it sends a message to everyone else: Don’t push too far, don’t mock the wrong person, don’t risk your future. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is why you don’t have to care about Jimmy Kimmel to care about what just happened. The point isn’t whether you think his monologue was funny or offensive or worse. The point is whether you’re comfortable with the president of the United States using regulatory threats to remove a critic from national television. If the government can do it to Kimmel, it can — and eventually will — do it to anyone who stumbles over the wrong line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump got to where he is because he saw a vulnerability in our system. In a media environment like this, shamelessness is a superpower. You can push the bounds of polite discourse and flood the zone with bullshit as long as you have no scruples. And now, having benefited from the openness of our public square, he&#8217;s slamming the gates shut behind him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension</a> — the direct result of an FCC threat to pull the licenses of networks that aired him —&nbsp;has shown us how authoritarianism can come to America.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I mean this literally. The specific threats that Federal Communications Commission head Brendan Carr made against networks, involving a little-used doctrine called “<a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/fcc-chair-brendan-carr-abc-jimmy-kimmel/">news distortion</a>,” show how easy it is to weaponize vaguely worded statutes and the executive’s discretionary powers against the president’s enemies. Such tools can also be used to reward friends — to provide regulatory favors, like merger approvals and exemptions from tariffs — who  toe a politically correct line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is how authoritarianism has taken root in other democracies, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump">most notably Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</a>. And from the get-go, President Donald Trump’s second term had been <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/398068/trump-musk-power-grab-hungary-orban">moving the United States down this road</a>. But for much of the time his efforts appeared <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410966/trump-democracy-100-days-losing">too haphazard and poorly planned</a> to produce a <em>consolidated</em> authoritarian regime — meaning one that could durably compromise the basic ability of its opponents to contest elections under reasonably fair conditions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the past few weeks, a series of developments —&nbsp;most notably, but not exclusively, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/on-the-right-newsletter/461722/charlie-kirk-killing-trump-vance-miller-free-speech-cancel">authoritarian energies unleashed</a> after Charlie Kirk’s death — have revealed a disturbingly credible policy pathway to power consolidation. We can now see how American Orbánism could take full root before the 2028 elections. We now know what a Trump-led authoritarian state in America would look like — and how we would get there from here.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a future would unfold in roughly four parts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, using hiring and firing powers to purge career civil servants from key agencies, like the Justice Department, and erode the traditional barriers preventing undue political influence on law enforcement and regulatory decisions. We saw this in the DOGE cuts, in the appointment of political hacks like Carr and Pam Bondi to top positions, and (most recently) Trump’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-poised-fire-us-attorney-resisting-effort-charge/story?id=125700904">move to fire a federal prosecutor</a> who refused to file politically motivated charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, using the power of these newly Trumpified agencies to target dissent in civil society — a broadening of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/421954/columbia-brown-harvard-trump-settlement-antisemitism">assaults on Ivy League universities</a>. This would include following through on threats to use <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/trump-rico-liberal-groups">racketeering charges</a> against liberal NGOs and going after other prominent critics the way they went after Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Third, bullying and bribing large corporations until significant economic power is concentrated in the hands of regime allies dependent on the president’s goodwill for their survival. To a degree, this is already happening —  see Trump’s habits of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tariffs-exemptions-pet-lobbyists-asbestos-confusion-secrecy">granted tariff exemptions to connected companies</a> or using the <a href="https://www.promarket.org/2025/08/11/trump-is-weaponizing-antitrust-and-regulation-us-consumers-will-suffer/">threat of antitrust enforcement</a> to bend CBS to its will. In an authoritarian America, such politicization would be expanded and deepened to the point where any corporation that crossed the White House would expect to pay a crippling financial cost.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Fourth, turn this accumulated power against the political opposition — turning elections into facially free contests where, in fact, Democrats face enormously unfair hurdles (and would likely be unable to govern even if they managed to succeed). This began with a nationwide push for <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/422532/texas-redistricting-mid-decade-gerrymander-abbott-democrat-trump-explained">mid-cycle redistricting</a>, but would require further steps (like turning the Justice Department <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-actblue-democratic-fundraising-9f990e668572709ce0e3260bbdb6f61b">investigation into the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue</a> into actual criminal charges).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point in the Trump administration, only the first has been accomplished to any significant degree. The efforts in other areas have been of limited effectiveness, stymied both by the courts and the Trump team’s incompetence.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But recently, and especially in the immediate wake of Kirk’s death, the administration has taken startling new swings in the second and third areas. If these efforts succeed, the fourth will become a live possibility: That is, we could be living in a country whose elections are no longer free and fair in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There is still plenty of time to prevent this future. Much depends on whether the Trump administration can get better at the nuts and bolts of lawfare, developing tactics that avoid legal hurdles or provoking a potent backlash. Acts of courage in Congress, the courts, the streets, and even corporate boardrooms could stymie Trump until at least the midterms.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the risk of authoritarian consolidation is real and growing. Now that the endgame is clear, it’s time for all of us to start thinking about how to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The anatomy of American authoritarianism</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The kind of authoritarianism I fear is emerging in the United States, which political scientists call “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/15/22522504/republicans-authoritarianism-trump-competitive">competitive authoritarianism</a>,” doesn’t involve the outright criminalization of the opposition or formal martial law. Instead, it depends on perverting the law, modifying and twisting it with the intent of incrementally undermining the opposition’s ability to compete fairly in elections.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a government can be constructed along the lines of what Princeton University’s Kim Lane Scheppele calls a “<a href="https://www.democratic-erosion.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Scheppele-2013.pdf">Frankenstate</a>:” that is, “an abusive form of rule, created by combining the bits and pieces of perfectly reasonable democratic institutions in monstrous ways. … No one part is objectionable; the horror emerges from the combinations.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is probably necessary, for example, to give the president a degree of discretion when it comes to policy areas that affect national security. It is also true that tariffs are often just taxes, not a tool for authoritarian control.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you combine those two things — creating <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/guide-trumps-section-232-tariffs-nine-maps">a situation</a> where the president has wide latitude to raise tariffs and provide exemptions to them on vague national security grounds —&nbsp;you create a situation where it’s all too easy for the president to weaponize his powers against corporations that cross his administration politically.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Frankenstate targets opposition parties through burdensome tax audits, dubious criminal investigations, and uneven application of campaign finance regulations. It also focuses on attacking the civil <em>foundations</em> of the opposition —&nbsp;meaning attacking the donors who might fund them, the activist groups who might stand up for their rights, and the free media they depend on to get their message out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Silence or coopt enough of these voices, and the ruling party doesn’t actually have to outlaw political opposition or stuff ballot boxes. The opposition will simply be weak enough that letting them compete poses little threat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So what would this look like in the United States?</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/gettyimages-2217852566.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0.0063243106501432,0,99.9873513787,100" alt="In the Oval Office, Trump sits at his desk with Elon Musk beside him" title="In the Oval Office, Trump sits at his desk with Elon Musk beside him" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Elon Musk speaks alongside President Donald Trump to reporters in the Oval Office on May 30, 2025. | Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In this America, corporations depend on the goodwill of the White House to remain profitable&nbsp;— depending on White House tariff exemptions and staying in the good graces of policitized regulators to avoid crippling punishments. Liberal billionaires like George Soros, Warren Buffett, and Mark Cuban would be made into examples:&nbsp;their corporate interests targeted by antitrust regulators and tax enforcement, while corrupt Justice Department attorneys would launch selective civil and even criminal charges against them personally. The rest of the billionaire class, getting the message, would largely avoid funding liberal causes, let alone the Democratic Party.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In this America, the press would be owned —&nbsp;in large part, though not entirely — by the regime’s favored and trusted oligarchs. These individuals would be able to control what enough Americans see to swing several percentage points of marginal voters from the “persuadable” to “solid R” column, putting Democrats at a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And in this America, what remains of the independent media and liberal activist class would be subject to the same kind of harassment directed at left-leaning billionaires. Fighting back would drain valuable resources Democrats would require to overcome their other financial and attentional disadvantages, creating near-insurmountable barriers to national viability.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a future may sound impossible. But recently, the Trump administration has taken specific actions that could —&nbsp;left unchecked — would bring us far too close to comfort.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How we get there from here</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First is a pursuit of media control, which goes well beyond censoring Kimmel. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that it had struck a deal with China that would <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/tiktok-buyers-group-to-include-oracle-silver-lake-andreessen">spin off TikTok USA</a> as a separate entity. Eighty percent would be owned by three US firms — two of which, Andreessen Horowitz and Oracle, are themselves controlled by Trump-aligned billionaires.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oracle’s owner, Larry Ellison, is partnering with his son David to build a broader media empire. David owns CBS; he is reportedly about to buy Bari Weiss’ the Free Press and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-david-ellison-bari-weiss-b2827230.html">put the anti-woke conservative</a> in charge of CBS as well. The Ellisons are also in serious discussion to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/opinion/larry-ellison-paramount-cbs-tiktok.html">purchase Warner Bros. Discovery</a> — which operates, among other properties, CNN and HBO.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Two independent journalistic voices, CBS News and CNN, could soon be combined into something potentially almost unrecognizable, something way too close to what is served up on a daily basis by the Murdochs,” the business journalist William D. Cohan writes in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/opinion/larry-ellison-paramount-cbs-tiktok.html">the New York Times</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Imagine all of this together not just with the Murdoch network, but Jeff Bezos’ right-wing remaking of the Washington Post, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5279570/meta-trump-settlement-facebook-instagram-suspensions">Mark Zuckerberg’s pro-Trump turn</a>, and Elon Musk’s control over X.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The government and its allies would have control over a massive portion of the informational landscape for young and old Americans — encompassing unprecedented portions of television, digital, and social media, plus what remains of print. The vast nature of their empires would make them dependent on the goodwill of increasingly politicized regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department, meaning that they would have powerful incentives to ensure their audiences were getting Trump-friendly content.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This would matter a great deal. High-quality political science research has <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/wp/FoxVoteQJEAug07.pdf">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20160812">demonstrated</a> that Fox News significantly increased the GOP’s vote share, the effect large enough to swing presidential elections. Now imagine not one Fox, but several — spreading regime-friendly propaganda across new and old media.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats might try to compensate by leaning on activists and donors. But the Trump administration has long signaled an intent to attack those: In April, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/investigation-into-unlawful-straw-donor-and-foreign-contributions-in-american-elections/">opened an sketchy investigation into ActBlue</a>, by far the most important Democratic platform for political donations in the country. The investigation will issue a report next month; it is possible some attempt at charges will follow.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2232068201.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="US Attorney General Pam Bondi speaking in front of a DOJ podium." title="US Attorney General Pam Bondi speaking in front of a DOJ podium." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US Attorney General Pam Bondi. | Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The ActBlue investigation began before Kirk’s death. Since then, the Trump administration has engaged in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461254/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump-radical-left-violence">campaign of incitement</a> against liberal activists and donors — alleging, with absolutely no evidence, that they played some role in radicalizing Kirk’s killer. Now Stephen Miller, perhaps the most important White House policy official, is vowing to wield the power of the state to crush them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The last message that Charlie sent me was…that we need to have an organized strategy to go after the left-wing organizations that are promoting violence in this country. And I will write those words on my heart and I will carry them out,” <a href="https://x.com/theblaze/status/1967629142318285005">Miller said</a> during a podcast taping with Vice President JD Vance. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have to [at] the DOJ, DHS, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie’s name.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Defiance, <em>collective</em> defiance, can make a big difference.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During that taping, Vance specifically named two large liberal organizations — the Open Society Foundation, funded by billionaire George Soros, and the Ford Foundation — as potential targets of Trump’s wrath. Now, the administration is preparing specific plans to go after these organizations. The Wall Street Journal reports that they are planning to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-republican-reaction-456d6237?mod=politics_lead_story">strip liberal groups of their tax-exempt status</a>; Trump is openly talking about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/trump-rico-liberal-groups">prosecuting Soros under the RICO Act</a>, an anti-racketeering law primarily used against organized crime.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration does not need to win in court for such cases to end up as strategic victories. If they can impose steep litigation costs, or successfully inhibit the operation of liberal groups during the process of litigation, they will have <em>already</em> weakened the opposition. They would then put their opponents in a no-win situation: either have their resources tied up in court while trying to vindicate their rights, or else choose to fold and negotiate a surrender package.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the playbook that they ran against universities, with real and continuing success.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Harvard, the principal institution fighting back, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-university-college.html">suffered severely</a> <em>even though</em> it keeps winning in court. Despite its pushback, the school has still given the White House some of what it wants and has been widely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/23/us/harvard-changes-academic-freedom-trump-deal.html">reported to be negotiating</a> a broader settlement. Meanwhile, the first institution to capitulate — Columbia — has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/nyregion/columbia-trump-settlement-what-to-know.html">surrendered both money and institutional autonomy</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This “heads I win, tails you lose” dynamic shows how Trumpian lawfare could, if applied as aggressively as the administration has been threatening since Kirk’s death, end up starving the Democratic Party of vital resources ahead of the 2028 presidential election. The tactic could even be used to punish the independent press, as we’ve seen with Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5543030/donald-trump-nytimes-lawsuit">lawsuits targeting the New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/29/nx-s1-5482955/trump-epstein-murdoch-deposition-lawsuit">the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether all this would be enough to tip America over into a full-blown competitive authoritarian regime like Hungary’s is tough to say. But that’s by design: In such a Frankenstate, the entire government system is built such that each individual action can seem democratic (at least, on a surface level). The Trump regime would need this to give room for GOP partisans, who do not see themselves as authoritarian, to rationalize what’s happening in democratic terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without clear benchmarks like the abolition of elections, it’s impossible to tell precisely when democracy has been lost.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to fight back</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy to read all this and think the fight for democracy is already lost. The Supreme Court is controlled by a 6-3 conservative majority <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/460270/supreme-court-republican-partisan-hacks-donald-trump">in thrall to Trump</a>, and Democrats are a minority in both houses of Congress until <em>at least</em> the 2026 midterms. Aren’t we just cooked?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To which I say: No! This attitude is part of the problem.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The slide toward competitive authoritarianism in America depends, crucially, on acquiescence — on the idea that people are unwilling to bear the costs of standing up to each individual attack on liberty before they can combine into true authoritarian control over society.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even <a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/the-authoritarian-checklist">the most pessimistic assessments</a> would say we’re not there yet: that Trump can’t pull something like what he did with Kimmel and expect to avoid mass pushback. That doesn’t mean a wave of popular and media protest will soon win Kimmel back his job. But Trump is <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker">immensely unpopular</a>, and Republicans are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/">likely to lose at least one house of Congress</a> in the midterms — which could significantly limit his ability to silence other prominent voices. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s approach also depends on a tactic that political scientists call “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/asian-journal-of-comparative-law/article/when-the-first-brick-falls-of-the-fortress-of-democracy-dealing-with-the-first-slice-of-the-salami-tactic-for-eroding-democracy/624544D27E8D494E449062C2BE4A66AF">salami slicing</a>”: cutting off one little bit of democracy at a time by targeting one specific person or group, thus avoiding a sense that the collective needs to stand up for shared rights. That’s why we’ve seen not an attempt to criminalize dissent per se, but a series of discrete individual efforts like the Kimmel threats and the New York Times lawsuit.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Defiance, <em>collective</em> defiance, can make a big difference. The more that people across sectors take public and coordinated action —&nbsp;Congress, the media, the business world, even ordinary civil society — the more they can puncture Trump’s sense of inevitability, by fighting against and delaying his power grabs until 2027, when Democrats could hold real power to stop and hold him accountable for them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This means, specifically, that we need more senators <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lz354ik44c26">talking about democracy the way Chris Murphy does</a>. It means more business organizations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/costco-shareholder-proposal-diversity-dei-0330f448741b35f2f788a36948ff3f95">refusing to implement Trump’s directives</a> and working with <a href="https://www.leadershipnowproject.org/">pro-democracy organizations like Leadership Now</a> to demand nonpartisan regulatory policy. It means donors making a show of putting more money, not less, toward anti-Trump causes in general and toward the legal funds of targeted institutions in particular. It means media refusing to cow to Trump, and providing relentless coverage of situations like Kimmel’s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And it means individual citizens attending protests and volunteering with the organizations under threat, as well as with political campaigns that could change things in 2026.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We are where Hungarians were in 2010, where Russians were in 2000, and where Germans were in 1933. Those places’ futures were not inevitable; had elites and even ordinary people made different choices, catastrophes could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ours still can be too.</p>

The Trump administration is openly coercing media organizations into suppressing speech that it does not like.&#160; On Monday night, late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel (irresponsibly) seemed to suggest that Charlie Kirk’s killer had conservative sympathies, before making several unrelated jokes at Donald Trump’s expense.  Two days later, FCC chair Brendan Carr warned broadcasters that if they [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">openly coercing</a> media organizations into suppressing speech that it does not like.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday night, late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203n52x1y9o">irresponsibly</a>) seemed to suggest that Charlie Kirk’s killer had conservative sympathies, before making several unrelated jokes at Donald Trump’s expense. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Two days later, FCC chair Brendan Carr <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">warned broadcasters</a> that if they continued to disseminate Kimmel’s program, the government might fine them or revoke their licenses. Within hours, ABC had indefinitely suspended Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This has posed a dilemma to many conservative commentators. On the one hand, right-wing pundits spent much of the past decade decrying the left’s censoriousness and insisting on the vital importance of free speech. On the other hand, they tend to think that Jimmy Kimmel is bad and that Donald Trump is good.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To their credit, some conservatives have registered <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/jawboning-and-jimmy-kimmel-free-speech-censorship">their objections</a> to Trump’s embrace of state sanctions on speech. But others have chosen to rationalize the administration’s behavior.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As they tell it, the Biden administration perpetrated <a href="https://x.com/Heminator/status/1968663796756480116">more severe and illegitimate</a> attacks on the First Amendment than Trump ever has. Liberal <a href="https://x.com/politicalmath/status/1968503233627746368">complaints</a> about Kimmel’s suspension are therefore <a href="https://x.com/Breaking911/status/1968460247653040148">hypocritical</a> and hyperbolic.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth noting that this claim would not justify the Trump administration’s behavior, even if it were true. An attack on free speech does not need to be historically severe or unprecedented to be worthy of condemnation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In any case, the right’s apologia for Trump’s FCC isn’t merely irrelevant but false. The president has now trammeled free speech rights far more blatantly and profoundly than his predecessor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why the right believes that liberals are getting a taste of their own medicine</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Right-wing defenses of the Trump FCC tend to center on one fundamental grievance: During the COVID pandemic, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/biden-administration-circumvents-first-amendment-bullying-private-actors#:~:text=vaccine%20misinformation,run%20around%20the%20First%20Amendment">pressured</a> social media companies to deplatform conservative critiques of public health policy. Republicans believe that this was a violation of the First Amendment. And they therefore see hypocrisy in liberal protestations against Kimmel’s suspension: If the left truly opposed government suppression of speech, it would have stood up for anti-vaxxers in 2021. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, in the view of <a href="https://x.com/Heminator/status/1968663796756480116">right-wing writer Mark Hemingway</a>, Biden’s actions were much more lawless than Trump’s: The FCC has the &#8220;legitimate regulatory authority” to punish broadcasters who spread misinformation, in the manner that Kimmel did. By contrast, the Biden administration “had ZERO authority over social media and still pressured them to censor information they found inconvenient.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To appreciate the problems with these arguments, one needs to understand what the Biden administration did and did not do, in its efforts to influence social media firms’ content moderation policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the COVID crisis in 2021, the Biden administration sought to deter the spread of misinformation about the pandemic in general and vaccines in particular. In pursuit of this goal, it subjected social media companies to public criticism and private lobbying. At one point, President Biden accused Facebook of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/us/politics/biden-facebook-social-media-covid.html">killing people</a>” by disseminating vaccine misinformation, while the White House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/16/psaki-vaccine-misinformation-499850">flagged harmful posts</a> for the company, and requested their removal or algorithmic suppression.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This conduct raised legitimate civil libertarian concerns. Technically, the Biden administration was merely offering its opinion on what social media companies should do, not dictating their policies. As White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/16/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-july-16-2021/#:~:text=Obviously%2C%20those%20are%20steps%20they,more%20that%20can%20be%20taken">said</a> of Facebook in July 2021, “They’re a private-sector company. They’re going to make decisions about additional steps they can take.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the federal government has considerable power to affect social media firms’ businesses. Companies could therefore have reasonably believed that failing to comply with Biden’s content moderation requests would have invited greater regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump’s attack on free speech has no precedent</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the Trump FCC’s conduct constitutes a graver assault on the First Amendment than the Biden administration’s jawboning of social media firms, for two primary reasons.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump and Carr have <em>explicitly</em> threatened to take punitive regulatory actions against companies that air speech that they do not like. On Wednesday, Carr warned that ABC affiliates that continued to carry Kimmel’s program would risk <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1968392506711613526">suffering fines and license revocations</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In saying this, Carr was echoing threats that Trump had already leveled. Last month, long before Kirk’s killing and Kimmel’s scandal, the president <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-again-pushes-us-agency-revoke-nbc-abc-station-licenses-2025-08-25/">declared</a> that he was “totally in favor” of revoking the broadcast licenses of ABC and NBC because “they are so biased and untruthful.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, the Biden administration’s lobbying of Facebook was not aimed at stifling dissent against the government, but rather, furthering public health. Vaccine misinformation presented a genuine threat to Americans’ well-being. Although the COVID vaccines ultimately provided less protection from infection than hoped, they did substantially reduce individuals’ risk of dying from the virus. Following their release, COVID death rates in Democratic and Republican areas of the country <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/data-download/uneven-toll-coronavirus-pandemic-rcna97107">sharply diverged,</a> due to conservatives’ greater reluctance to get vaccinated. Some research indicates that universal vaccination could have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/05/13/1098071284/this-is-how-many-lives-could-have-been-saved-with-covid-vaccinations-in-each-sta">prevented</a> more than 300,000 COVID deaths.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t necessarily mean that the Biden administration’s behavior was justified. But it does suggest that its efforts were aimed at advancing a genuine public interest, not at undermining its political opposition.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump FCC, by contrast, has been targeting speech critical of the administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that Carr’s ostensible complaint with Kimmel was that the host spread misinformation about Kirk’s assassination. But we know that this administration does not harbor a principled objection to unfounded speculation about Kirk’s death — because it has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461254/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump-radical-left-violence">relentlessly engaged in such speculation itself</a>, suggesting repeatedly (and baselessly) that progressive organizations were implicated in the activist’s killing. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, the administration almost certainly jumped on Kimmel’s indiscretion because the host is a critic of their regime. We can discern as much from context: When the president threatened to revoke ABC’s license in August, he did so on the grounds that the network had been running “97% BAD STORIES” about him, despite his “very high popularity.” Thus, it is this administration’s <em>explicit</em> position that broadcasters who cover it too critically should be barred from the airwaves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Crucially, Trump’s FCC has not merely threatened to subject adversarial outlets to heightened regulatory scrutiny but actually done so. Upon taking office, Carr <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/news-distortion-the-new-fake-news/">launched</a> an investigation into ABC for fact-checking Trump during a 2024 presidential debate and another against CBS for its editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. These probes were both inspired by tendentious allegations of political bias — complaints that the FCC would lack legal authority to redress, even if they could be proved. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, by signaling its willingness to use regulatory discretion for partisan ends, the FCC succeeded in compelling America’s most-watched broadcast network into adopting more favorable editorial practices. Earlier this year, CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, was seeking to merge with Skydance Media, a transaction that required FCC approval. To secure the administration’s blessing, Paramount <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-again-pushes-us-agency-revoke-nbc-abc-station-licenses-2025-08-25/">pledged to ensure</a> that CBS’s news and entertainment programming would be free of bias. The company also committed to hiring an ombudsman who would review any complaints about its content’s political slant. The FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, decried these concessions as “never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This precedent may have contributed to Kimmel’s suspension. Shortly after Carr aired his threats against ABC affiliates, Nexstar — America’s largest owner of local TV stations — <a href="https://www.nexstar.tv/nexstar-abc-affiliates-to-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live-indefinitely-beginning-tonight/">announced</a> that its channels would not carry Kimmel’s show. Nextar is currently seeking to buy one of its rivals for $6.2 billion, a deal that will require FCC approval.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The FCC does not have the authority to punish Kimmel’s speculation about Charlie Kirk’s assassin</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, contrary to Hemingway’s suggestion, it is not true that the FCC has the regulatory authority to punish broadcasters for airing speech like Kimmel’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Commission <em>does</em> have the power to punish “<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/hoaxes">broadcast hoaxes</a>.” But these are defined as instances in which a broadcaster disseminates information that 1) it knows to be false and 2) foreseeably causes “direct” and immediate “public harm” — in the sense of “actual damage to property or to the health or safety of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public health and safety authorities from their duties.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel’s remarks do not remotely fit this description. In his controversial aside, the comedian said, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Interpreted literally, Kimmel’s line is not even indisputably false. Kimmel technically did not assert that Kirk’s suspected killer was a conservative, only that the “MAGA gang” was desperate to counter that impression. Regardless, there is no evidence that Kimmel knew what he said to be untrue, nor that any immediate public harm resulted from his misleading comment.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Hypocrisy is not a justification for tyranny</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives are not wrong to find <em>some</em> progressives’ advocacy for free speech hypocritical or opportunistic. Segments of the left really did embrace <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/opinion/sunday/harpers-letter-free-speech.html">illiberal attitudes</a> toward free expression in recent years and fought to punish the expression of <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24156540/israel-palestine-protests-columbia-universities-free-speech">legitimate (or even popular)</a> points of view on college campuses and in the media. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration’s efforts to counter COVID misinformation, meanwhile, arguably undermined First Amendment rights. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet a White House <em>explicitly</em> threatening to shut down adversarial broadcasts constitutes a greater assault on political liberty than anything that progressive activists or Joe Biden ever did. Left-wing hypocrisy does not justify right-wing tyranny. Those who suggest otherwise are confessing their contempt for constitutional rule.</p>

A United Nations commission published a 72-page report on Tuesday that concluded Israel has committed a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.&#160; “It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” said Navi Pillay, chair of the commission.

<p class="has-text-align-none">A United Nations commission published a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">72-page report</a> on Tuesday that concluded Israel has committed a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/israel-has-committed-genocide-gaza-strip-un-commission-finds">said Navi Pillay</a>, chair of the commission. The commission’s findings specifically determined that Israel has perpetrated at least four of the five acts of genocide as defined by the 1948 Genocide Convention. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report adds yet another voice to the growing consensus that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza constitutes a genocide. Leading <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/">international</a>, <a href="https://www.alhaq.org/publications/25781.html">Palestinian</a>, and <a href="https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20250728_our_genocide">Israeli</a> human rights organizations have already released reports saying so. More recently, the International Association of Genocide Scholars <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-worlds-top-scholars-on-the-say">passed a resolution</a> that stated the same conclusion. They have been joined by <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/who-says-israel-committing-genocide-gaza-list-politicians-countries">at least 20</a> members of Congress who have called the war in Gaza a genocide.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The two latest members of Congress to make that statement did so after the UN commission’s report was released. “The intent is clear. The conclusion is inescapable: Israel is committing genocide in Gaza,” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/op-eds/it-is-genocide/">wrote</a> in an op-ed on Wednesday. In another op-ed, Rep. Becca Balint, a Democrat from Vermont, echoed the sentiment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Today, I believe the Israeli government is committing a genocide against the Palestinian people,” <a href="https://couriernewsroom.com/news/rep-becca-balint-i-believe-israel-is-committing-a-genocide-in-gaza/">Balint wrote</a>. “As the granddaughter of a man murdered in the Holocaust, it is not easy for me to say that. But the trauma of the Holocaust serves as a reminder of the power of speaking out.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This growing consensus comes as Israel faces more and more pressure from the international community to stop the war, especially since the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) — the world’s leading authority on hunger crises — determined that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/422622/israel-famine-gaza-history-weaponizing-starvation-war">Israeli policy has created</a> a famine in Gaza. But Israel has ignored those calls and has instead <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/israel-gaza-city-occupation-ground-offensive">recently launched</a> a ground offensive to invade and occupy Gaza City.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the UN commission’s report says</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission — officially called the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel — was created in 2021 by the UN Human Rights Council. And since the start of the war in Gaza, it has been investigating violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Genocide Convention <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition">lays out five acts</a> that constitute genocide if any of them are undertaken with the “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The newly released report concludes that Israel is responsible for four of the five: “(i) killing members of the group; (ii) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (iii) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; and (iv) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” specifically by destroying health care infrastructure, including maternity wards and a fertility clinic. The report said there’s no evidence of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition#:~:text=A%20physical%20element%2C%20which%20includes,in%20whole%20or%20in%20part">fifth act of genocide</a>, which is forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report outlines various statements from Israeli officials to underscore intent. “Several statements by Israeli officials advocated for collective punishment against the Palestinian people as a whole or the population of Gaza in particular,” the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">report said</a>. “Some statements recognised that there was a difference between civilians and combatants but urged that all Gazans should be punished for the actions of the militants on 7 October 2023.”</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, invoked <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/facing-amalek">violent biblical references</a> in a letter to Israeli soldiers. “Remember what Amalek did to you,” the prime minister wrote. “This is a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness.” In the Book of Samuel, God tells the Israelites to “go and attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.”&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, implied that all Palestinians in Gaza should be held accountable for Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians who were not aware and not involved. It is absolutely not true.”&nbsp;</li>
<li>Yoav Gallant, then the Israeli defense minister, further dehumanized Palestinians, stating that Israel was fighting “human animals” and must “act accordingly.” Gallant also said, “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. There will be no Hamas. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if these official statements leave room for doubt, the report doesn’t solely rely on them to infer intent but also focuses on Israel’s pattern of conduct. That includes Israel blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza and the forced starvation of Palestinians; targeting Gaza’s health care system; destroying the enclave’s educational, religious, and cultural facilities; perpetrating sexual and gender-based violence; and deliberately targeting children.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s one example: “Sexual violence [against Palestinians in Gaza] was used as a means of punishment and intimidation from the moment of arrest and throughout detention, including during interrogations and searches,” the report stated. “Several male detainees reported that Israeli security forces personnel had beaten, kicked, pulled or squeezed their genitals, often while the detainees were naked. One detainee stated that he had been forced to strip and ordered to kiss the Israeli flag. When he refused, he had been beaten, and his genitals had been kicked so severely that he had vomited and lost consciousness.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report also said that the commission received credible information concerning “many cases of rape” and added that Israeli forces “sexually harassed and publicly shamed” Palestinian women.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission also documented how the mass killing of civilians — the death toll in Gaza has now reached <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-wars-09-17-2025-902e4a41eb3c5802fd18c598083d247a">more than 65,000 people</a> — has often been deliberate. “The Commission found that the Israeli security forces had clear knowledge of the presence of Palestinian civilians along the evacuation routes and within the safe areas but nevertheless they shot at and killed civilians, some of whom (including children) were holding makeshift white flags,” the report said. “Some children, including toddlers, were shot in the head by snipers.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These are just a few of the horrific details among the commission’s findings, which are worth <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">reading in full</a>. But Israel has denied the allegations made in the report, resorting to tired tactics of calling it “fake,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/09/16/gaza-genocide-un-israel/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">accusing</a> the report’s writers of being antisemitic, and even “serving as Hamas proxies.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What impact will this report have?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That this report is coming from an independent commission established by the UN only lends further credence to the piling charges and expert determinations that Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even for some skeptics, that conclusion is becoming harder and harder to avoid. Last month, for example, the president of J Street, a liberal-leaning Zionist lobbying group, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/j-street-head-says-hes-now-convinced-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/">said</a> that while he might not use the term “genocide” himself, he “cannot and will not argue any more against those using the term. I simply won’t defend the indefensible,” adding that he has “been persuaded rationally by legal and scholarly arguments that international courts will one day find that Israel has broken the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf">international genocide convention</a>.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The report was also published just before the UN General Assembly is set to convene next week, which will likely highlight Israel’s growing international isolation as world leaders gather to discuss the most pressing concerns around the globe. More and more Western states, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/458013/recognizing-palestinian-state-uk-france-australia">have already pledged</a> to recognize Palestine as a state, and the report’s conclusions will only add more pressure for states to take action to stop the genocide, such as arms embargos, boycotts, and sanctions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the report only adds to a growing chorus of experts and observers who have concluded that Israel is committing the crime of crimes. On its own, though, that will not carry much weight without corresponding government measures. And if Israel’s allies — chiefly, the United States — continue to support its military campaign while imposing few, if any, conditions on aid, then there is no end to the horror in sight.</p>

You’re a researcher working at International Business Machines, the world’s leading tabulating machine company, which has recently diversified into the brand-new field of electronic computers. You have been tasked with determining for what purposes, exactly, your customers are using IBM’s huge mainframes.</p>
<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer turns out to be pretty simple: computers are for the military, and for the military alone. In 1955, the year before, by far the biggest single revenue source for IBM’s computer division was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">SAGE Project</a>, a Defense Department initiative tasking IBM with creating a computer system capable of providing early warnings across the United States should nuclear-armed Soviet bombers attack the country. That brought in $47 million in 1955, and other military projects brought in $35 million. Programmable computers sold to businesses, meanwhile, brought in a paltry $12 million.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You send a memo to your boss explaining that computers’ impact on society will primarily be in giving the US an edge on the Soviets in the Cold War. The impact on the private sector, by contrast, seems minor. You lean back in your chair, light a cigarette, and ponder the glorious future of the defense-industrial complex.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You would, of course, be totally wrong — not just in the far future but in the very immediate one. Here’s what revenue looked like from each of IBM’s computing divisions in 1952 through 1964, compiled by company veteran <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/2730/Building-IBMShaping-an-Industry-and-Its-Technology">Emerson Pugh in his book <em>Building IBM</em></a>:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Emerson-W.-Pugh-Building-IBM_-Shaping-an-Industry-and-Its-Technology-1995-The-MIT-Press.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Appendix D in a history of IBM, showing company revenues from different forms of computing" title="Appendix D in a history of IBM, showing company revenues from different forms of computing" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Emerson Pugh, &lt;em&gt;Building IBM&lt;/em&gt;." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">A mere two years after 1956, programmable computers sold to private companies had matched SAGE as a revenue source. The year after that, the private sector was bringing in as much as the military as a whole. By 1963, not even a decade after the 1955 data you were looking at, the military appears to be a rounding error next to IBM’s ballooning private computer revenues, which have grown to account for a majority of the company’s entire US revenue.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whoops!</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can we learn from how people are using AI right now?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, impressive teams of economists at both <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w34255">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report">Anthropic</a> released big, carefully designed reports on how people are using their AI models —&nbsp;and one of my first thoughts was, “I wonder what an IBM report on how people used their first computers would’ve looked like.” (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent. Also, Future Perfect is funded in part by the BEMC Foundation, whose major funder was also an early investor in Anthropic; they don’t have any editorial input into our content.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear: the level of care the AI firms’ teams put into their work is many, many orders of magnitude greater than that shown by our fictional IBM analyst. Revenue isn’t the best measure of actual customer interest and use; everyone knew even in 1955 that computers were improving rapidly and their uses would change; the AI firms have access to an impressive array of real-time data on how their products are used that would have made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson">Watson</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson_Jr.">family</a> running IBM salivate.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, I think the IBM example is useful for clarifying what, exactly, we want to get out of this kind of data.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI firms’ reports are most useful at giving us a point-in-time snapshot, and a recent history over a couple of years, of what kind of queries are being sent to ChatGPT and Claude. You might have <a href="https://link.vox.com/view/6827a6294cfe5416df0e96f5orh4x.1iso/b6d0fe12">read my colleague Shayna Korol</a> in Wednesday’s Future Perfect newsletter laying out the OpenAI findings, and I also recommend the study coauthor and Harvard professor <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/how-people-use-chatgpt">David Deming’s summary</a> <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/chatgpt-really-does-offer-mundane">posts</a>. But some big picture, non-trivial things I’ve learned from the two reports are:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Uptake is skyrocketing: ChatGPT has gone from 1 million registered users in December 2022, to 100 million people using it at least weekly by November 2023, to over 750 million weekly active users now. If the number of messages sent to it keeps growing at the current pace, there will be more ChatGPT queries than Google searches by the end of next year.</li>
<li>Both OpenAI and Anthropic find that richer countries are using AI more than poor ones (no surprise there), but OpenAI intriguingly finds that middle-income countries like Brazil use ChatGPT nearly as much as rich ones like the US.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://forklightning.substack.com/p/chatgpt-really-does-offer-mundane">biggest use cases for ChatGPT</a> were &#8220;practical advice&#8221; like how-tos or tutoring/teaching (28.3% of queries), editing or translating or otherwise generating text (28.1%), and search engine-style information queries (21.3%). Anthropic uses different descriptive categories but finds that people using Claude.ai, the ChatGPT-like interface for its models, most commonly use it for computing and math problems (36.9% of usage), while an increasing share use it for &#8220;educational instruction and library&#8221; work (12.7%).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What <em>can’t</em> we learn?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’m greedy. I don’t just want to know the first-order descriptive facts about how these models are used, even though those are the kinds of questions these papers, and the internal data that OpenAI and Anthropic collect more generally, can answer. The questions I really want answered about AI usage, and its economic ramifications, are more like:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Will <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23787024/power-progress-book-ai-history-future-economy-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson">human and AI labor be complements or substitutes</a> for each other in five years? Ten years? Twenty?</li>
<li>Will <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-great-inflection-a-debate-about-ai-and-explosive-growth">wages go up because the economy is still bottlenecked</a> on things only humans can do? Or will they collapse to zero because those bottlenecks don’t exist?</li>
<li>Will AI enable the creation of <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace">“geniuses in data centers”</a> — AI agents doing their own scientific research? Will this lead the stock of scientific knowledge about the world to grow faster than ever before? Will that lead to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24108787/ai-economic-growth-explosive-automation">explosive economic growth</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people are asking these questions, and an impressive amount of theoretical work has been done in economics already on them. I’ve found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hS-Pu0gq22IwB9mWeig8Ui9kvUITgHj9eH3ik2zNVpo/edit?tab=t.0">this set of lecture slides and paper citations on the subjects from the economist Philip Trammell</a> very useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But that theoretical work is mostly in the form of, “what are some concepts that we could use to make sense of what is happening or will shortly happen?” —&nbsp;it’s theory, that’s the point! —&nbsp;and thus leaves a greedy, impatient man like myself without good answers, or even particularly good guesses, at the above questions. It’s a place where I want good empirical research to give me a sense of which theoretical frameworks are corresponding to ground reality.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My fear is that, for reasons the IBM parable explains, empirical details about how AI is being used now can mislead us about how it will be used in the future, and about its most important effects on our lives. If you cryogenically froze our IBM analyst in 1956 and resurrected them today to analyze the OpenAI and Anthropic reports, what would they say about the more speculative questions above?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They might point to the fact that the ChatGPT study found about half of all messages correspond to a pretty small number of &#8220;work activities,&#8221; as tracked by the Department of Labor, like &#8220;documenting/recording information&#8221; and &#8220;making decisions and solving problems.&#8221; Those are big categories for sure, but people have to do a lot else in their work that doesn&#8217;t fall under them. Our IBM analyst might conclude that AI is only automating a pretty small share of work tasks, meaning that human and AI labor will complement each other going forward.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, the analyst could look at the Anthropic report which found that &#8220;automation&#8221; use cases (where you just tell Claude to do something and it does the whole task, perhaps with periodic human feedback) are vastly more common among businesses using Anthropic&#8217;s backend to program their own specific Claude-enabled routines than &#8220;augmentation&#8221; use cases (where you ask Claude for feedback or for learning, etc., and work in concert with it). Augmentation still makes up a bigger share of usage on the <a href="http://claude.ai/">Claude.ai</a> website, but the automation share is growing there too. Our analyst might look at this and conclude that AI and human labor will wind up as substitutes, as Claude users are using it less as a sidekick than as an agent doing work on its own.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of these conclusions would be, I think, premature to the point of recklessness. This is why, to their credit, the authors of both the OpenAI and Anthropic reports are very careful about what they do and don’t know and can and cannot infer from their work. They’re not claiming these findings can tell us about the medium or long-run effects of AI on labor demand, or the distribution of economic growth, or the professions that will be most affected by AI — even though that’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/16/anthropic-economic-index-report-automation-entry-level-jobs-gen-z/">precisely what a lot of outside observers are doing</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI is different from corn (I promise this makes sense)</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So let me finish by focusing on something the reports do tell us that is, I think, crucially important. One of the oldest findings in the economics of innovation is that new technologies take time, often a long time, to “diffuse” through the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The classic paper here is <a href="https://iaes.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/pdf/77.pdf">Zvi Griliches in 1957 on the spread of hybrid corn</a>. Hybrid corn was not one specific product, but a particular approach to breeding corn seeds optimally for specific soil in specific areas. Once a few farmers in a state adopted hybrid corn, subsequent uptake seemed to be unbelievably fast. Look at those S-curves!</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/griliches_corn.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A chart showing the adoption of “hybrid corn” techniques from 1932 to 1956 in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama. They adopted the technology in that order, and it penetrated deeper into agriculture in Iowa than in later states like Texas." title="A chart showing the adoption of “hybrid corn” techniques from 1932 to 1956 in Iowa, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama. They adopted the technology in that order, and it penetrated deeper into agriculture in Iowa than in later states like Texas." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Zvi Griliches, “Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological Change&quot;" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But while diffusion within individual states was fast, diffusion between states wasn’t. Why did Texas need a decade after the rise of hybrid corn in Iowa to realize that this could greatly increase yields? Why did it seem to hit a much lower ceiling of 60-80% usage, compared to universal uptake in Iowa? You also see these kinds of lags when looking at cases like <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2006600">electricity</a> and in <a href="https://dcomin.host.dartmouth.edu/files/exploration_technology.pdf">datasets covering a wide array of inventions</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Something the Anthropic and OpenAI data tells us pretty clearly is that the diffusion lags for AI are, by historical standards, very short. Adoption of this tech has been rapid, indeed faster than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">earlier online products</a> like Facebook or TikTok, let alone hybrid corn.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Past general-purpose technologies like electricity or computing took years or decades to diffuse through the economy, which limited their benefit for a time but also gave us time to adapt. We will likely not get that time this go-around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> The Trump administration is leaning into its attack on free speech after pressuring ABC to take late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Kimmel was suspended by ABC on Wednesday after comments from President Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a podcast appearance Wednesday, Carr said, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Subsequently, two major broadcast groups announced their intent to pull Kimmel’s show from local stations; Nexstar, one of those groups, needs FCC approval for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/business/media/nexstar-tegna-deal.html">pending merger</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What did Kimmel say?</strong> Ostensibly, Kimmel’s suspension was over arguably misleading but relatively anodyne <a href="https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1968456521353756883">remarks</a> he made about the death of Charlie Kirk earlier this week. On Thursday, however, Trump gave away the game, <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1968739210376134781">telling reporters</a> that, “When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump…They’re not allowed to do that.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Under the First Amendment, the government cannot suppress speech, no matter how much it might disagree with it. Kimmel’s suspension didn’t require any concrete action by the FCC, but it clearly came in response to Carr’s comments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Carr also said Thursday that “I don’t think this is the last shoe to drop…the consequences are going to continue to flow.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">As my colleague Zack Beauchamp has written</a>, this is Trump’s most brazen attack on free speech yet, and right out of a familiar autocratic playbook. Trump has a long way to go before he achieves a level of media control like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán — but the speed with which he was able to get Kimmel suspended is a concerning sign. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the fatal shooting of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461408/charlie-kirk-shooting-killed-right-way-suspect">conservative influencer Charlie Kirk</a> last week, observers rushed to take part in what’s become one of America’s most gruesome past times: waiting to figure out the politics of the shooter, so blame could be assigned to one party or the other for the tragedy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservative politicians hurried to identify the shooter as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/5499567-reporter-mace-democrats-kirk-killing/">a far-left Democrat</a>. After Tyler Robinson was arrested for the shooting, left-wing commenters circulated unfounded theories that Robinson might be a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/groyper-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes-tyler-robinson">Groyper</a>, a white supremacist who thought Kirk’s racism didn’t go far enough. The war over Robinson&#8217;s identity reached a crescendo with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/461948/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-trump-fcc-charlie-kirk">Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s suspension</a>, after the late-night host seemed to imply Robinson was a MAGA supporter in a monologue Monday night. Meanwhile, the right, starting with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, has sought to spin Kirk’s killing into a larger narrative about the left’s propensity for political violence, a claim that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">isn’t backed by evidence</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, as Arie Perliger, a professor of criminology at UMass Lowell who has studied hundreds of political assassinations from the past century, has found, political violence is a much more complicated phenomenon than the current discourse would have us believe. “Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right?” he told Vox in a video interview.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And a closer look at assassinations reveals that the reasons for them run the gamut. For every assassin <a href="https://scout.lib.utk.edu/repositories/2/resources/1860">guided by a clearly comprehensive ideology of hatred and bigotry</a>, there’s one who thinks <a href="https://lblandmark.org/who-were-the-assassins-john-hinckley-jr-and-samuel-byck/">assassinating a US president will help him impress an actor</a> (Ronald Reagan and Jodie Foster, respectively). Thomas Matthew Crook, who shot at Donald Trump during a campaign event last summer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/08/us/thomas-crooks-trump-shooter-butler-rally.html">was a registered Republican who also donated to Joe Biden’s campaign</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perliger thinks that when we endlessly obsess over the individual politics of an assassin, we’re focusing on the wrong question.&nbsp; “I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson,” he said. Those conditions, per Perliger’s research, include political polarization and endemic dysfunction —&nbsp;two qualities the US government has in spades right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can read highlights from my conversation with Perliger below. They’ve been lightly edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Give me a quick overview of some of the research you&#8217;ve done on assassins.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten years ago, when I was faculty at West Point, we compiled a data set of around 700 political assassinations — not just of elected officials, but also judges and some other political figures.&nbsp; We tried to really understand if we could identify some patterns, some similarities, and if you could produce some kind of insights about the factors that can facilitate political assassinations.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we were able to find out is that political assassinations are a combination of two factors. First of all, there’s increasing political polarization and the overlap of different societal cleavages. The second thing is that in many cases, it is being utilized when groups, constituencies, individuals, movements are losing trust in the political system. In other words, they deem the political system as ineffective.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, when we want to promote political changes, it demands a lot of resources, time, money, mobilizing the masses, and so on. Political assassination is perceived as a very quick shock to the system that can really dramatically change the political landscape and as a result can help the assassin to promote their objectives, their agenda.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that is really striking is how frequently, for a lot of these very famous assassinations, the agenda at hand is hard to understand from the outside. How common is it for assassins to act for political reasons that the rest of us have a lot of trouble parsing?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our expectation to see someone in his 20s having some kind of a coherent ideological framework — it&#8217;s a bit unrealistic, even if they do extreme acts of violence or any kind of extreme act.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s very difficult to understand how attitudes, emotions, and perceptions intersect to lead a young person to perpetrate [a crime]. This is why I tend to focus more on how the environment leads those individuals or confused individuals, which are very common in that age, to engage in those kinds of acts of violence. I&#8217;m not just talking about political assassination. I&#8217;m talking in general about why we see young people much more comfortable in engaging in different acts of violence or extreme activities, including on campuses. I think that&#8217;s the real question that I&#8217;m trying to answer and to look at in my research.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do political assassins tend to be younger? Is age correlated with assassination in the data set?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not necessarily, actually. Our data set goes back to World War II, and it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that most political action until the early 2000s, most groups that challenged the government or challenged the social order, were very organized. They were actual institutionalized organizations. They actually met with each other. They actually distributed physical texts.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What happened in the last 20 years is that a lot of those movements and a lot of those ideas now are virtual ones, where part of the ethos is direct action: “If you&#8217;re really a believer, you should not expect any kind of organizational support. You should act.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We see that on the environmental side, for example. A lot of environmental groups encourage members to act independently to protest against environmental policy that they don&#8217;t like, and so on. We see that also in the extremities of the left and the right, the idea that, in this day and age, we need to engage in these kinds of little resistances. If you really believe in those goals, in those ideologies, if you are really committed to the cause, you should act based on your own resources, based on your own capabilities. That&#8217;s really the secret sauce that will enable the movement to be more effective and to move forward. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And this is why you see so many lone actors recently, including during assassinations, which is much different than what we&#8217;ve seen in the past.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One of the things that I&#8217;m interested in is that whenever a tragedy like this occurs, there&#8217;s a rush from observers and politicians and people in the media to try to figure out what side of the political aisle the perpetrator was on, so we can all decide who to blame for what they did. From your perspective, what do you think leads to that impulse? And is there any use to it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? “He talked with his parents about how much he hates Kirk, so he’s on the left. His parents are Republicans, so he actually grew up in a conservative family.” It&#8217;s completely unproductive, and it doesn&#8217;t really tell us anything. In general, I&#8217;m very reluctant to focus on specific individuals. I think that we can learn much more about the overall conditions that facilitate people like Tyler Robinson.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s really funny to see all this cherry-picking. Each side picks the details that fit their own narratives, right? </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that I really emphasize when I&#8217;m being asked about this is the fact that political polarization has created a dysfunctional political system. Politicians today have zero incentives to engage in bipartisan politics. Congress, for a long time, has not actually engaged in policy construction, and cannot really produce any kind of shared politics.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s this strong sense that the system is delegitimizing the democratic process, and it creates a vacuum where different groups can argue democracy doesn&#8217;t work. “It&#8217;s obvious democracy doesn&#8217;t work. We should engage in other means in order to promote our objectives, whether it&#8217;s engaging in mass disruption, whether it&#8217;s burning everything that we can burn or killing people.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second element is that the incentives to go to the extreme create an ongoing delegitimization and demonizations of political rivals. Every policy that the other side promotes is an existential threat, is a catastrophe coming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was tracking far-right online spaces during the Biden administration, every day they were sure that their constitutional rights were being violated, that their civil liberties were under threat. They were sure that antifa was at the gates. Every policy that Biden promoted was perceived as, “Okay, that&#8217;s the end of America.” In many ways, we see that now.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, we can have policy debates, but not every policy is an existential threat to the republic. We need to be able to actually have a discussion that is more nuanced. No wonder that people think that we have to do something, because things are going really, really bad. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The combination of all those things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned has created an environment which normalizes the usage of political violence, normalizes a consistent challenging of the system and the status quo. It’s created a situation where everybody feels that we&#8217;re in a very dark place. That&#8217;s because the mechanism that&#8217;s supposed to overcome those dark places is not really functioning anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of my colleagues don&#8217;t like me saying that. I got tons of emails of all the interviews I did in the last few days: How dare I blame both sides? I blame both sides because I think both sides are engaged in similar rhetorical practices, and both sides are involved in violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like you’re arguing that the political system has become so dysfunctional that a response of nihilism is, in some ways, quite rational. Is that a fair summary?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Definitely. In a different environment, people like Tyler Robinson would find more constructive ways to express their concerns. However, considering all the things that I&#8217;ve just mentioned to you, all those factors that work together, it&#8217;s no wonder that some of those individuals resort to those kinds of actions. It&#8217;s a broader theme that we see about how the entire societal discourse is normalizing these kinds of things. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/390911/luigi-mangione-uhc-shooter-manifesto-reddit-blackpill">Luigi Mangione</a> became a folk hero in some circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s going back to the lack of even basic empathy as human beings, and the fact that ideology basically encompasses everything, that we stop seeing people. We&#8217;re seeing everyone through ideological lenses and ideological prisms. We&#8217;re losing the basic understanding that our discourse would be much better if you maintain some of those aspects of some of those sentiments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m always being asked what&#8217;s the one thing that our leaders can do. I always tell them that they don&#8217;t need to talk. They actually need to engage in bipartisan behavior that will signal to their constituencies that the other side is not necessarily evil. Once you signal to your constituency that it is possible to work with the other side, that&#8217;s a strong enough message to understand that it&#8217;s actually possible to create things together, and not just each side engaging in performative politics that maybe give them some votes from their bases, but doesn&#8217;t really promote anything really constructive.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there anything we haven’t discussed about this assassination that you think is particularly of note?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s two things that I think are really interesting. First of all, the expansion of political assassinations outside the political system. Charlie Kirk was not an elected official. He was a public speaker, and you can argue he was probably more influential than many other elected officials. That created a different discourse among what we call the influencers on the right and the left. It&#8217;s not just that suddenly they are talking about their own sense of security, but it also shows that politics right now is probably much more combustible outside the institution. It created different dynamics of where politics is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second thing I think is it happened on a university campus. It&#8217;s another reflection of the fact that campuses are becoming spaces for very contentious acts and violent acts. Campuses are less and less becoming places where you can actually engage in intellectual debate and exchange of ideas. Most people on campus these days are reluctant to engage in any kind of political discourse or any kind of issues, because of the potential cost. So we are losing universities as spaces where there&#8217;s actual intellectual debate, and they are becoming more spaces where both sides are doing performative politics, just doing performance, rather than actually talking to each other.&nbsp;</p>
