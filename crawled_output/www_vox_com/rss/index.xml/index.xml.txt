<p class="has-text-align-none">Palestinian statehood has never had so much international support — or seemed less attainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As world leaders gather in New York City on Monday for the UN General Assembly, the question of Palestinian statehood is at the top of the agenda. On Sunday, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/21/world/europe/starmer-uk-recognize-palestinian-state.html?ref=abuaardvarkghost.ghost.io">confirmed</a> that they now recognize Palestine as an independent state, following France, which announced its intention to do so last July and formalized it with a speech by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, and Malta, among others,<strong> </strong>have announced plans to recognize Palestine as well. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, representatives of most of the world’s countries — but not the United States or Israel — gathered on the sidelines of the assembly for a <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/high-level-conference-two-state-solution-july2025/">meeting</a>, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, to discuss implementing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also missed the meeting after being denied a visa to travel to New York by the United States, but addressed the assembly by video. Monday’s meeting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-overwhelmingly-endorses-two-state-solution-declaration-that-condemns-hamas-2025-09-12/">followed the passage</a>, on September 12, of a UN General Assembly resolution now being referred to as the “<a href="https://onu.delegfrance.org/new-york-declaration">New York declaration</a>,” outlining &#8220;tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps&#8221; toward a two-state solution. The resolution was backed by<strong> </strong>142 of the assembly’s 193 members.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at Monday’s meeting. “Without two states, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and radicalism will spread around.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Washington, <a href="https://www.merkley.senate.gov/merkley-leads-historic-call-for-u-s-recognition-of-palestinian-statehood/">a new resolution cosponsored by eight senators</a> calls on President Donald Trump to recognize Palestinian statehood. Calling for a two-state solution is hardly a radical position in US politics, but calling for unilateral recognition of Palestine — rather than supporting a process by which a Palestinian state would emerge out of negotiations — is a more dramatic step, and it’s unlikely the resolution would have gotten even this level of support before the war in Gaza. Still, even though none of those senators are Republicans, and the resolution is unlikely to pass, the level of support for a measure that calls for unilateral recognition is an <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/09/18/america-is-falling-out-of-love-with-israel">indication of how politics on this issue have shifted in the United States</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not that any of this is swaying the Israeli government. “There will be no Palestinian state. This place is ours,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/netanyahu-vowsthere-palestinian-stateahead-meeting/story?id=125489981">declared earlier this month</a> at a ceremony announcing Israel’s expansion of the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim. In fact, his government is weighing formally annexing parts of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/01/middleeast/israel-west-bank-annexation-palestinian-state-intl">the West Bank in retaliation</a> for the wave of recognition by Western governments. This in turn prompted a warning from the United Arab Emirates — arguably the most significant of the Arab countries that normalized relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term — that it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uae-could-downgrade-diplomatic-ties-if-israel-annexes-west-bank-sources-say-2025-09-18/">downgrade diplomatic ties </a>if Israel went ahead with annexation. At the same time, the war in Gaza is only escalating, as the Israel Defense Forces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/hundreds-thousands-flee-israeli-militarys-devastating-assault-gaza-cit-rcna232359">advance into Gaza City and thousands flee</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality in Israel and Palestine is so intractable that it raises the question of whether the global mobilization behind statehood is anything more than political theater. It also raises the possibility that the world may be coming to consensus on Palestinian statehood just as it slips out of reach as a realistic possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Breakthrough or theater?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared independence in 1988, some 145 countries have recognized Palestine, including the recent additions, according to a tally by <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-recognizes-the-state-of-palestine-who-doesnt-and-why-does-it-matter/">Agence France Presse</a>. That includes nearly all of Africa, Latin America, and the former Communist bloc. Most of those who do <em>not </em>recognize it are close US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Western Europe had, for the most part, refrained from recognizing, but that has shifted rapidly during the war in Gaza, with Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia making the decision to recognize Palestine last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The additions of Britain and France to the list are particularly significant, as it means that the United States is now the last permanent member of the UN Security Council that does not recognize a Palestinian state. Palestine currently has “<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148351">permanent observer status</a>” at the UN, meaning it can participate in debates, but not vote on resolutions in the main UN bodies. The Security Council has to approve new members and all five permanent members have veto power, so membership is not on the table for now. But the Senate resolution suggests that won’t necessarily be the case forever. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), one of the cosponsors of the resolution, told Vox that the senators pursued it because “we have to create some light at the end of the very dark tunnel in the Middle East right now.” He added: “I do believe that the best way to ensure security and dignity and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians is through a two-state solution.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-face-the-nation-transcript-09-21-2025/">interview with CBS</a> on Sunday, Macron said that “recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1948551777504174570">has charged</a> that France’s move is a “reckless decision that only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace.” Macron countered that in fact it would “isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians” and provide an alternative political vision. Notably, the New York declaration, which the majority of Arab states supported, calls for disarming Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Skepticism about the recognition declarations has come not just from supporters of Israel, but also from its critics, who see recognition as a means for governments to deflect criticism over their failure to hold Israel to account for the carnage in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is worse than political theater,” said <a href="https://arabcenterdc.org/team/dr-tamara-kharroub/">Tamara Kharroub</a>, deputy executive director of the Arab Center in Washington, DC. “It’s a smokescreen to mask their decades-long failure to implement this very two-state solution and to end Israel’s occupation and apartheid, and their complicity in the genocide that has been taking place in Gaza for the past two years.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/richard-gowan">Richard Gowan</a>, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said the flurry of activity around Palestinian statehood at the UN this week would be a form of “fantasy diplomacy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that the leaders of these countries “felt they had to make a declaration, but there isn&#8217;t really a plan to go with it. The only way that you can really back this up would be for these countries and the wider UN membership to agree to some sort of framework for sanctions against Israel. I just don&#8217;t think the political will is there to put the amount of pressure on Israel that you would need to actually dissuade Netanyahu and his government from the current course of action.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Two-state dreams, one-state reality</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile on the ground in Israel and occupied territories, a two-state solution looks farther off than ever. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/03/israeli-public-is-increasingly-skeptical-about-lasting-peace/">Only 21 percent of Israelis</a> believe their country can coexist peacefully with a Palestinian state, according to a Pew poll, down 14 percentage points since before Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attacks. (The infeasibility of a two-state solution may ironically be one of the few things <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/650636/dim-outlook-peace-middle-east.aspx">Israelis and Palestinians can agree on</a>.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As the war in Gaza drags on, members of Netanyahu’s government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are now publicly discussing proposals to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/28/israels-smotrich-calls-for-phased-gaza-annexation-if-hamas-does-not-disarm">annex parts of the enclave if Hamas</a> does not surrender; late last week, Smotrich touted the territory as a potential “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y59z6rznvo">real estate bonanza</a>.” Those comments are in line with Trump’s apparently <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/31/trump-gaza-plan-riviera-relocation/">still active proposals</a> to turn Gaza into a tourist resort after the “voluntary” relocation of its civilian population.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Israeli officials have also discussed responding to the wave of Palestine recognitions by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c86cb087-da8c-4e4f-926c-40804b3992e2">formally annexing parts of the West Bank</a>. This could take several forms: from annexing Israeli settlements close to Israel, to annexing the area along the border between the West Bank and Jordan, to annexing all of what’s known as “Area C” — the 60 percent of the West Bank currently under Israeli security control. Far-right ministers like Smotrich have proposed going even further and dissolving the Palestinian Authority entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Van Hollen, who recently visited the West Bank, dismissed these threats, saying it’s clear that plans for annexation are already underway. “For them to pretend that the actions they&#8217;re taking in the West Bank are in response to calls for recognition of a Palestinian state is just a cover story,” he said. “It&#8217;s a big lie.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.inss.org.il/person/guzanskyyoel/">Yoel Guzansky</a>, a former Israeli government adviser who now leads the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, told Vox that Netanyahu “needs a green light from the Trump administration” to move ahead with annexation. “He could not do it without it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his advisers <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/what-the-hell-was-that-netanyahu-annexation-announcement-caught-trump-off-guard/">have sent mixed signals on the issue</a> over the years. Axios has reported, citing Israeli officials, that Rubio, who visited Israel earlier this month, has signaled that the Trump administration is not opposed to annexation, but other administration officials disputed the Israeli <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/13/rubio-netanyahu-israeli-annexation-west-bank">characterization</a>. While a “two-state solution” was long bipartisan orthodoxy in Washington, Trump has suggested in the past he’s not wedded to the idea, and some members of his administration, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/11/west-bank-annexation-evangelical/680658/">openly annexationist</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What may deter Trump from giving Netanyahu a green light is the effect that annexation would have on one of his signature accomplishments: the Abraham Accords. Even a “limited” annexation of West Bank territory would likely drive a deeper wedge between Israel and its erstwhile partners in the Arab world. West Bank annexation would be another red line crossed, and the government of the UAE — which has close relations with the Trump administration — has warned the White House <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/03/israel-annex-west-bank-uae-trump-abraham-accords">that it could unravel the accords</a>, entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Guzansky said that the Abraham Accords countries “might not cancel the agreement entirely” if Israel went ahead with annexation, but that the agreements are “becoming an empty shell of something that was once seen as a model peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors, a ‘Cold Peace’ agreement.” That could mean the Arab states continue cooperating with Israel on security, but do so without the people-to-people exchanges or deeper political and economic integration that the accords had promised.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Israel’s path toward isolation</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years ago, Netanyahu likely would have also pointed to normalizing relations between Israel and countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco as one of the crowning foreign policy achievements of his long era in office. The grand prize, normalization with Saudi Arabia, seemed at least a realistic possibility. The Abraham Accords saw many Arab governments willing to sidestep the Palestinian issue to find common ground with Israel on trade and their shared rivalry with Iran.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The sheer level of devastation in Gaza, though, and the global reaction to it, have made that sidestepping much more difficult for even the most jaded and autocratic governments to maintain. Israel’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/419650/israel-mowing-grass-iran-hezbollah-yemen">military strikes throughout the Middle East</a> in recent months, particularly the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/460845/qatar-hamas-israel-gaza">recent airstrike on Qatar</a>, have further convinced these governments that Israel is increasingly a source of regional instability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent speech, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-admits-israel-is-economically-isolated-will-need-to-become-self-reliant/">warned Israel</a> that it would likely have to accept an increasingly isolated position on the world stage for the time being, and transform into a “super Sparta” and “adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Regional integration and good relations with its neighbors would be nice, in other words, but in the Israeli government’s view, if the price is a negotiated end to the war in Gaza and serious steps toward accepting Palestinian statehood, it’s just not worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week’s events in New York<strong> </strong>are unlikely to bring about a Palestinian state in reality — or end the carnage in Gaza — but they may one day be seen as an inflection point in Israel’s path toward isolation on the world stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Trump administration pressured late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air last week, my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote about what it tells us about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462076/trump-democracy-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk">President Donald Trump&#8217;s roadmap to ending American democracy</a>. I spoke with him about some of his big takeaways, including what we can do to prevent that kind of democratic erosion,&nbsp;for Vox’s daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can also sign up for the newsletter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup">here</a>&nbsp;for more conversations like this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It was an eventful week. What changed in your understanding of the Trump administration and democracy?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My view for most of the second Trump administration has been that they are pursuing a policy agenda that threatens American democracy, but that they were doing so <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/458808/trump-dc-immigration-authoritarian-stephen-miller-democracy">poorly and haphazardly</a> (and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410966/trump-democracy-100-days-losing">thus were likely to ultimately fail</a>).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But recently, and especially since Charlie Kirk’s death, they seem to have gotten a lot more serious about consolidating power. By that, I meant that the White House has taken credible steps toward policies that would materially stack the deck in favor of the Republican Party.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A few examples include striking a deal to spin off TikTok USA and put it in the hands of MAGA-friendly ownership; threatening to go after leading liberal NGOs using RICO, an anti-racketeering law designed for mob prosecutions; and weaponizing a little-used FCC rule to threaten station licenses if they air Jimmy Kimmel, leading to his suspension.</p>

</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No single one of those policies, on its own, destroys democracy. But they point to a generalized pattern: one in which policy is bent toward crushing the financial and civil society support base that allows for meaningful democratic politics.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You write that you&#8217;re afraid of the US sliding toward “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/6/15/22522504/republicans-authoritarianism-trump-competitive">competitive authoritarianism</a>.” What is that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Authoritarian governments come in lots of different styles. This one doesn’t involve the outright criminalization of the opposition, formal martial law, or even Russian-style fake elections. Instead, it depends on perverting the law, modifying and twisting it with the intent of incrementally undermining the opposition’s ability to compete fairly in elections.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Competitive authoritarian regimes target opposition parties through burdensome tax audits, dubious criminal investigations, and uneven application of campaign finance regulations. They also focus on attacking the civil foundations of the opposition — meaning attacking the donors who might fund them, the activist groups who might stand up for their rights, and the free media they depend on to get their message out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Silence or co-opt enough of these voices, and the ruling party doesn’t actually have to outlaw political opposition or stuff ballot boxes. The opposition will simply be weak enough that letting them compete poses little threat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US, this would look like a country where corporations depend on the goodwill of the White House to remain profitable, leading the wealthy to cease meaningful support for Democrats. The press would be owned — in large part, though not entirely — by the regime’s favored and trusted oligarchs. And what remains of the independent media and liberal activist class would be subject to relentless state harassment, draining the resources they would need to fight back on an increasingly uneven playing field.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How far are we down that road?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are roughly four areas you should be watching for progress.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump using hiring and firing powers to purge career civil servants from key agencies, like the Justice Department, and erode the traditional barriers preventing undue political influence on law enforcement and regulatory decisions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Trump using the power of these newly Trumpified agencies to target dissent in civil society — a broadening of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/421954/columbia-brown-harvard-trump-settlement-antisemitism">assaults on Ivy League universities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Third, Trump bullying and bribing large corporations until significant economic power is concentrated in the hands of regime allies dependent on the president’s goodwill for their survival</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And fourth, Trump turning this accumulated power against the political opposition — turning elections into facially free contests where, in fact, Democrats face enormously unfair hurdles (and would likely be unable to govern even if they managed to succeed).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of these four, I think there has only been <em>significant</em> progress in the first. He has extensive control over the executive branch, thanks in part to the willingness of key officials like Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Andrew Ferguson, and Brendan Carr to play ball. But American civil society remains vibrant, large corporations and the media mostly independent, and the opposition still relatively free to act.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s happened recently looks a lot like Trump offensives in the other areas, especially the second and third. This is a serious emergency.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What can we do to prevent that future?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Actually, a lot!</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The slide toward competitive authoritarianism in America depends, crucially, on acquiescence — on the idea that people are unwilling to bear the costs of standing up to each individual attack on liberty before they can combine into true authoritarian control over society.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even <a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/the-authoritarian-checklist">the most pessimistic assessments</a> would say we’re not there yet: that Trump can’t pull something like what he did with Kimmel and expect to avoid mass pushback. Trump is <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/trump-approval-tracker">immensely unpopular</a>, and Republicans are <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-history-tells-us-about-the-2026-midterm-elections/">likely to lose at least one house of Congress</a> in the midterms, which could significantly limit his ability to silence other prominent voices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s approach also depends on a tactic that political scientists call “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/asian-journal-of-comparative-law/article/when-the-first-brick-falls-of-the-fortress-of-democracy-dealing-with-the-first-slice-of-the-salami-tactic-for-eroding-democracy/624544D27E8D494E449062C2BE4A66AF">salami slicing</a>”: cutting off one little bit of democracy at a time by targeting one specific person or group, thus avoiding a sense that the collective needs to stand up for shared rights. That’s why we’ve seen not an attempt to criminalize dissent per se, but a series of discrete efforts like the Kimmel threats and the New York Times lawsuit.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Defiance, collective defiance, can make a big difference. The more that people across sectors take public and coordinated action — Congress, the media, the business world, even ordinary civil society — the more they can puncture Trump’s sense of inevitability, by fighting against and delaying his power grabs until 2027, when Democrats could hold real power to stop and hold him accountable for them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This means, specifically, that we need more senators <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrismurphyct.bsky.social/post/3lz354ik44c26">talking about democracy the way Chris Murphy does</a>. It means more business organizations <a href="https://apnews.com/article/costco-shareholder-proposal-diversity-dei-0330f448741b35f2f788a36948ff3f95">refusing to implement Trump’s directives</a> and working with <a href="https://www.leadershipnowproject.org/">pro-democracy organizations like Leadership Now</a> to demand nonpartisan regulatory policy. It means donors making a show of putting more money, not less, toward anti-Trump causes in general and toward the legal funds of targeted institutions in particular. It means media refusing to bend to Trump and providing relentless coverage of situations like Kimmel’s.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And it means individual citizens attending protests and volunteering with the organizations under threat, as well as with political campaigns that could change things in 2026.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/your-mileage-may-vary-advice-column" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Your Mileage May Vary</a>&nbsp;is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It’s based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/418783/liberal-democracy-value-pluralism-isaiah-berlin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value pluralism</a>&nbsp;— the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other.</em>&nbsp;<em>To submit a question, fill out this&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctX2yDEss1RnRlesUBKc1vmCxneDRvsgJlGQ5pDsef39RKtA/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anonymous form</a>. Here’s this week’s question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity</em>:</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>My partner and I did IVF recently and luckily we ended up with several embryos. One of those will be implanted in me so I hopefully get pregnant. But which one?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>My fertility clinic is encouraging me to do PGT-A testing, which would screen for things like Down syndrome and would also let me see the sex of each embryo so I could potentially choose whichever I want. (And to be honest, I really want a girl!) I&#8217;m also hearing about these new companies that can test embryos for all kinds of things — like how smart the kid might be, how tall they&#8217;ll get, and whether they&#8217;ll have a lower chance of getting breast cancer, diabetes, mental illness, stuff like that.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I don’t know how to feel about any of this. On the one hand, it feels weirdly eugenics-y to do so much tinkering with embryos, and I can’t help feeling a little pressured into overmedicalizing everything with these expensive tests. But then again, if I could do something to make my baby healthier and happier, don&#8217;t I kind of have to do everything in my power? What does a parent owe their child?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Dear Expecting,</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is such an exciting —&nbsp;and also confusing —&nbsp;time. You’re about to have your first kid, and that comes with all sorts of fears and insecurities and hopes and dreams. You want to do the right thing —&nbsp;no, the best thing! — for your child. It’s a beautiful impulse. Unfortunately, it makes it easy for companies to prey on you.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So let me walk you through what these companies can and can’t really provide. After we talk about the science, we can talk about the ethics.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The simpler test you mentioned, PGT-A, has been around since the 1990s. It can indeed screen for conditions like Down syndrome and let you see the sex of each embryo. Mind you, that doesn’t predict what gender your child will ultimately end up identifying with —&nbsp;more on that soon.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The newer testing you mentioned is called polygenic testing. The conditions it screens for are complex ones, influenced by thousands of genes. We’re talking about everything from breast cancer to depression. Some companies even offer screenings not for disease prevention, but for genetic enhancement —&nbsp;so you can select for a taller kid or a kid with higher IQ.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Polygenic testing companies claim to predict each embryo&#8217;s risk for each condition, and the potential reduction of risk you’ll get if you choose one embryo over another. As the <a href="https://theinfinitesimal.substack.com/p/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about">statistical geneticist Sasha Gusev explains</a>, it’s very, very easy to be misled by this claim. If the company claims to lower absolute risk of Type 2 diabetes by 12 percent, you might think this means, “The chance of my kid ever developing diabetes just went down by 12 percent —&nbsp;great!” But really what it means is that, all else equal, a kid who would’ve developed diabetes is likely now at the high end of pre-diabetes instead, or just develops diabetes a few years later. The same holds true for other conditions, like breast cancer. Sure, if your kid is going to develop diabetes or breast cancer, you’d rather they develop it later —&nbsp;but it’s not the bill of perfect health customers might imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Typical risk reduction estimates tend to exploit statistical assumptions to overstate their benefits and lead to confusion,” Gusev writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also important to note that there’s a difference between a physical disease like cancer, which is straightforwardly and universally negative, and a complex mental health condition like depression. For one thing, <a href="https://ericturkheimer.substack.com/p/the-new-eugenics-companies">polygenic scores don’t perform as well in psychiatry</a>, as psychologist Eric Turkheimer notes. Plus, most mental health conditions come in mild to moderate to severe forms, and it’s not clear that we should want to get rid of mild or moderate manifestations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Sure, it would be nice if no one ever got depressed, but what would that actually mean?” Turkheimer writes. “People are going to be sad, and the most modern models of psychiatric disorders view most of them as extremes on continuous dimensions of normal behavior. I don’t think we want some kind of genetic version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(Brave_New_World)">Soma</a>.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To give a personal example: I have generalized anxiety with some obsessive tendencies. Is that a major pain in the butt sometimes? You bet. But if I could wave a magic wand and get rid of it, would I? No. In my experience, this trait is linked to another trait I deeply value: my creativity. The same thing that propels me down rabbit holes of worry also propels me down rabbit holes of getting super curious about some topic, researching it into the wee hours of the morning, and then writing a novel or children’s book about it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That brings me to one other scientific issue: pleiotropy. It’s a fancy term for a simple truth, which is that genes can have an effect on more than one trait. When it comes to behavioral polygenic testing, we actually know very little about which genes <em>cause</em> what — a gene that’s correlated with depression or anxiety may also be correlated with a bunch of other things. So, if everyone were to start selecting embryos to try to protect their kids from depression or anxiety, what would happen? We don’t know!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Pleiotropy is a scientific issue, but it’s also a moral issue, because in trying to protect your kid from a negative outcome, you could also be accidentally barring them from a positive one.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s just the tip of the moral iceberg.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another issue is the potential psychological harm that can result from commodifying our kids —&nbsp;treating them like consumer objects with selectable parts. Let’s say you use polygenic testing to try to select for high IQ. Even if the company’s predictor is right 80 percent of the time, that means it’s wrong 20 percent of the time. What happens if it’s wrong about your kid, and they end up with a low IQ instead of a high one? How will your kid feel? Unless you hide the truth from them, they’ll know that they are not what you wanted, that they failed to live up to the vision you went out of your way to chase.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The same goes for sex selection via good old PGT-A. I know you really want a girl. But what would happen if you select for a girl, and then your child grows up and turns out to be trans? They may feel an extra sense that they’re letting you down by not conforming to the gender expectations you had for them.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are the ethical questions around unequal access. Polygenic testing isn’t cheap. (One company, Orchid, charges $2,500 per screened embryo. Test 10 embryos and that’ll cost you $25,000.) So, at least in the short term, that raises the specter of entrenching a caste system, where the gap between rich and poor expands dramatically as the rich get smarter and stronger.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Technologies tend to get cheaper over time, so maybe everyone will ultimately be able to afford polygenic testing. But that raises another problem: implicit coercion. If more and more of us make ourselves smarter and stronger, we may create a society in which everyone feels pressure to alter their child’s biology — even if they don’t want to. To refuse embryo selection would mean to put a child at a huge professional disadvantage, or to face moral condemnation for making “suboptimal” kids when optimization is possible. Society may no longer offer health insurance benefits or accommodations for kids with disabilities (or even non-enhanced IQ), reasoning that “it was the parents’ choice.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some philosophers, like Julian Savalescu, already argue that parents have a “<a href="https://www.academia.edu/12965784/The_Moral_Obligation_to_Create_Children_with_the_Best_Chance_of_the_Best_Life">moral obligation to create children with the best chance of the best life</a>.” Polygenic testing companies love that argument; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/opinion/genetics-children-noor-siddiqui.html?unlocked_article_code=1.ck8.Z7vW.lKisTb4ZhtKn&amp;smid=url-share">Orchid founder Noor Siddiqui tells parents</a> that “the responsible decision” is to “protect their children” from disease, using language like, “What if you could have stopped it&#8230;but chose not to?” And we generally live in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/387570/moral-optimization">culture that’s obsessed with optimization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s no wonder that you find yourself asking, “If I could do something to make my baby healthier and happier, don&#8217;t I kind of have to do everything in my power?”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a view that will be very appealing to utilitarians, who believe the right action is the action that <em>maximizes</em> well-being or happiness. But maximizing principles can be dangerous. If we’re laser-focused on maximizing one value, however noble it may be, that can lead us to overlook a host of other important values. Think about diversity, for example; polygenic testing could lead to a less diverse world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s not even clear how to maximize well-being given that each embryo will have some downsides: How would you choose between one embryo with a slightly elevated risk for schizophrenia, another with a moderately elevated risk for cancer, and a third with a high risk for Alzheimer’s? You’d have to decide how to rank the importance of each condition, which would require a dizzying bit of moral math: How much weight do you put on the longevity associated with each condition, how much on patient-reported quality of life for each condition, and how much on your own ability to cope with each —&nbsp;and society’s ability (which will change over the years)? Plus, even if the screening does end up optimizing life for your individual child, it could have negative effects on the population level, for the reasons we covered above.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As Nobel laureate Herbert Simon pointed out, many problems contain way more variables and way too much uncertainty for maximizing along a single axis to be feasible or even desirable. So it often makes sense to just go with an option that’s “good enough.” He coined the term “satisficing” — a portmanteau of “satisfying” and “sufficing” — to describe opting for this good enough choice.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What would satisficing look like in the context of embryos? If there’s a very serious condition that runs in your family —&nbsp;like Tay-Sachs or the BRCA mutation that markedly increases cancer risk — then I do think there’s a strong case for screening for that. These conditions are debilitating and can lead to early death. Nobody wants them. Genetic testing that lets us prevent them is an awesome gift.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are conditions that can include suffering, like autism, but can also be very compatible with a happy life. Mental health conditions in particular are heavily socially constructed —&nbsp;a lot of the associated suffering comes about because society constructs a certain biological reality as a problem and doesn’t support the people who have it. In these cases, if you want to give your child a “good enough” or even “optimized” life, remember that you don’t have to achieve that by biological means; working to change the social environment can be just as important, and it doesn’t carry the societal risks associated with polygenic testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, when considering what counts as a “good enough” life, each parent will draw the line in a slightly different place. And there’s a part of that that can’t be boiled down to objective facts about disease, because this is also about how well-resourced the parent feels —&nbsp;emotionally, socially, and financially —&nbsp;to deal with a certain condition. What feels manageable to one parent may feel crushingly hard to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So, I can’t tell you exactly which screenings to do and which to forgo. What I do want to tell you is to resist being bullied or shamed by others, especially those with a profit incentive to push you in a certain direction.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As the epidemiologist Abby Lippman has noted, <a href="https://web.ntpu.edu.tw/~markliu/prenatal_genetic_testing.pdf">genetic testing is supposed to offer parents</a> more choice, but it too often has the opposite effect. When someone like Orchid’s Siddiqui says about a disease, “What if you could have stopped it&#8230;but chose not to?”&nbsp;—&nbsp;well, that language preys on parents’ worst fears and insecurities.&nbsp;It holds parents hostage while pretending to be giving them more autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You are nobody’s hostage. You are a moral agent free to look at the many different relevant factors, weigh them all in the balance, and then make the choice that works well enough for your family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bonus: What I’m reading</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Silicon Valley is obsessed with IQ, so it’s no surprise that tech execs there are using polygenic testing in hopes of creating supersmart babies. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/silicon-valley-high-iq-children-764234f8?mod=hp_lead_pos9">This article</a> shows the kind of mental pretzels customers get into when trying to figure out whether to select the embryo with the highest predicted IQ or that with the lowest risk of disorders. One couple asks: “How much additional risk of ADHD cancels out against 10 extra IQ points?”</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Rereading “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/the-last-children-of-down-syndrome/616928/">The Last Children of Down Syndrome</a>,” Sarah Zhang’s 2020 Atlantic feature on prenatal testing, it struck me that when people think “prenatal testing,” Down syndrome is often the first condition that comes to mind, even though it’s not the most severe or straightforwardly negative (it’s compatible with a happy life). It’s just that Down syndrome was easy to test for, so we started testing for it early. I wonder if that built up the condition as a bogeyman in the expectant parent’s imagination —&nbsp;if the fact that we <em>could </em>screen for it shaped the public&#8217;s perception of Down syndrome as something that <em>should</em> be screened for and potentially screened out.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One trait that many people assume we should select for is a great memory. But I highly recommend the short story “<a href="https://vigeland.caltech.edu/ist4/lectures/funes%20borges.pdf">Funes the Memorious</a>” by Jorge Luis Borges. It’s a reminder that having <em>too</em> good a memory is not always a benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All his life, Shea Mandli had a clear vision for his future. A wife who would see him through the ups and downs of life. Six, maybe seven, kids to whom he would pass on life lessons. So far, things haven’t panned out.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s single — and has been for about three years after ending a six-month relationship. He’s disillusioned both by online dating and how tough it can feel to approach women IRL. “No longer the ‘no’ is the worst thing that could happen,” says Mandli, a 31-year-old living in Minneapolis. “It&#8217;s almost like a humiliation tactic if you want to introduce yourself.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The gulf between Mandli’s goals and his reality has affected his well-being. He’s lonely, he says; he yearns for intimacy. When he looks at all the couples gathered around the table at Friendsgiving, he wonders what it would be like to have someone to experience it all with. At times, he wonders if he’ll ever meet someone. “I feel a void,” Mandli says. “I feel lonely that I don&#8217;t have a companion. Sometimes that may give me a tougher exterior, because I don&#8217;t want to project into the world that I&#8217;m lonely.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Mandli is among a growing cohort of young — often straight — unpartnered men who wish they weren’t. According to Pew Research Center, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/">63 percent of men under 30 are single</a>, compared to 34 percent of women. Half of these men are searching for a committed relationship or casual dates, compared to 35 percent of single women. Bucking against stereotypes painting single women as desperate for romantic partnership and men as content eternal bachelors reticent to be tied down, recent research has shown that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506241287960">single women are overall more satisfied </a>with their lives compared to single men. Another study from Germany found that men were less likely to initiate a breakup, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39418415/">were less satisfied with being single,</a> and wanted a partner more than women. Partnered gay men, according to a Chinese study, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1134198/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com">had better mental health</a> than those who were single. Other research has found unpartnered gay men associate <a href="https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/csp/2025.v41n7/e00228324/en">being single with loneliness.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Recent research has shown that single women are overall more satisfied with their lives.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Much has been made of the plight of young men recently: They’re falling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/upshot/boys-falling-behind-data.html">behind women in education</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/21/why-more-men-are-dropping-out-of-the-workforce.html">employment</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/04/17/the-shares-of-young-adults-living-with-parents-vary-widely-across-the-us/">independence</a>, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/690788/younger-men-among-loneliest-west.aspx">social connection</a>. Could the lack of romance in their lives — and their yearning for it — be the key to understanding their dissatisfaction? Or are they unlucky in love <em>because</em> they lack the tools to build a happy life with meaningful connections in myriad ways? It turns out rigid norms around masculinity may have a self-fulfilling effect, both contributing to unhappiness with being single while making it more difficult to find a partner, too.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How men become emotional castaways</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Being single is hardly a bad thing in and of itself — plenty of people happily choose to live unpartnered. But many men see a romantic relationship as their primary emotional outlet, which makes lacking one particularly unmooring. In his years of working with men in therapy, <a href="https://www.redlands.edu/faculty-and-staff-directory/psychology/fredric-rabinowitz">Fredric E. Rabinowitz,</a> a psychology professor at the University of Redlands, has noted “a lot of guys tend to put all their emotional eggs in one basket,” meaning they expect their partner to be their social be-all end-all: one person with whom they confide in, problem-solve, joke around, have sex, do chores.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“A lot of guys tend to put all their emotional eggs in one basket.”</p><cite>Fredric E. Rabinowitz, psychology professor at the University of Redlands</cite></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is mostly because, as boys, they’ve been taught that talking about their emotions in most contexts is <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6142169/">weak or unmasculine</a>. “What they learn to do is just keep it inside,” Rabinowitz says. To fill the emotional void, <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/en/press-portal/nachrichten-en/january-2025/nr-2517">men seek a romantic partner,</a> the one person with whom society permits men to be totally vulnerable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A tendency to bottle up emotions has implications for both romantic and platonic relationships. When adolescent boys learn the tenets of manhood — strength, stoicity, independence — <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ask-an-academic-the-secrets-of-boys">intimate friendship can seem at odds</a> with these ideals. Thus, platonic relationships may become more surface level, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2869101/">focusing on shared activities</a> over heartfelt connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, men who never learned to speak about their emotions, a core element of romance, may also find it difficult to date, says <a href="https://drronaldlevant.com/">Ronald Levant</a>, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Akron. “Emotional intimacy requires that you be open about how you&#8217;re feeling,” he says, “and if men can&#8217;t do that, they&#8217;re not going to be able to form relationships.” Men can easily become emotional castaways, struggling to open up with friends and potential romantic partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lack of social support has myriad negative effects, regardless of gender: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01617-6">higher risk of mortality</a>, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2014.0114">depression, poor sleep quality, weakened immunity</a>, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4274570/">anxiety, and low self-esteem</a>. Having a network of people to rely on has been found to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK585650/">strengthen a person’s coping abilities and quality of life</a>, even while stressed. Among single gay men, social support from friends and family <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1550428X.2012.705621">contributed to higher well-being</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also true that for men, having just one person in your corner — your romantic partner — does appear to be transformative, contributing to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31094543/">overall health and happiness</a>. Married men have better <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8888778/">mental and physical health than unwed ones</a>, perhaps due to the fact that in heterosexual relationships, their wives might undertake the bulk of the housework and remind them to go to the doctor. “A man in a relationship may have someone say, ‘Do you really want to have that third beer? Haven&#8217;t you had enough?’ Or ‘Shouldn&#8217;t you have more vegetables with your meals, rather than just pork chops?’” says Levant, the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-problem-with-men-insights-on-overcoming-a-traumatic-childhood-from-a-world-renowned-psychologist-ronald-f-levant/21578379?ean=9798888244302"><em>The Problem with Men: Insights on Overcoming a Traumatic Childhood From a World-Renowned Psychologist</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the obvious pros, men may feel like they have a lot to gain by partnering up. According to as-of-yet unpublished findings from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elainehoan/?originalSubdomain=ca">Elaine Hoan</a>, a researcher at the University of Toronto, simply expecting that a relationship will bring you happiness may be enough to make it true. Hoan and her colleagues found that when singles who believed romantic relationships will improve their lives actually pair off, they are indeed happier. “It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s backfiring,” Hoan says, “where you want it so badly and then you get it and it&#8217;s not what you want it to be.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For so long, Reuben Woodall was constantly reminded of what he was missing out on when he was single. Not only did he feel like romantic relationships were “put on a pedestal” in culture and media, but heterosexual depictions of “ideal” love only made him feel like queer love was unattainable. “Gay relationships are often seen as short-lived, lustful encounters rather than meaningful endeavors,” Woodall, a 29-year-old who lives in Bristol, UK, says in an email, “so pursuing a romantic relationship could feel hopeless.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At times, Woodall was empowered by singleness, other times, resentful and despondent, thinking that he’d be alone forever. During the three years he was single, Woodall focused on improving his life by pursuing hobbies “rather than wallowing in the pain of singleness,” he says. Now in a new relationship, his outlook has transformed. “My problems feel smaller,” he says, “knowing I have someone to hold, confide in, and encounter life alongside means a blanket of comfort has fallen over every experience. Romance is inherently exciting and that permeates through everything.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Masculine ideals shape relationships</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the benefits relationships confer, another reason some men may struggle with perpetual singledom: traditional views of masculinity about what a man could and should be. Having a partner aligns with this heteromasculine archetype — that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10192784/">men should be sexually active, have a romantic relationship, and head up a family</a> — and is seen as a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10713733/">status symbol for men</a>, especially if their partner is conventionally attractive, according to Hoan.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not being able to embody this archetype might conjure up feelings of self-consciousness, internalized homophobia, and shame, says Hoan.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In his experience, Rabinowitz, the men’s therapist, has found single guys tend to blame themselves for their circumstances. “It&#8217;s like, ‘What&#8217;s wrong with me? Why aren&#8217;t I attracting women? I&#8217;m not sure I know how to be in a relationship that works,’” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Research supports the idea that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10192784/">men feel deficient</a> without a partner. They attribute self-consciousness as one of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-018-0163-7">top reasons for their singleness,</a> along with poor flirting skills, bad looks, and shyness. “As a woman, I was really surprised by that, because I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s why women are not interested in you,” Hoan says. “Single men seem to be missing the point when it comes to what it is that women are looking for and I think they’re going the opposite way, honing in on the Andrew Tate-like mindset, or the inceldom, and doubling down on grasping onto these straws of masculinity when they feel like women are just rejecting me because I&#8217;m bad at this thing.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Men attribute self-consciousness as one of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-018-0163-7">top reasons for their singleness,</a> along with poor flirting skills, bad looks, and shyness.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When men feel like they have very little to offer a romantic partner, they might start to shift the blame away from themselves to the very object of their desires. Nowhere else is this more apparent than <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/10/23547393/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-qa">the manosphere</a> — hyper-masculine corners of the internet, home to the likes of influencers like Tate and Jordan Peterson, focused on misogyny and outdated sexist stereotypes of relationships. For these followers, women are <a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/camh.12747">weak and selfish</a> and <a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12308">must be dominated in relationships</a>. A recent survey from consumer research firm GWI found Gen Z men were almost three times as likely to prioritize dominance as a personality trait, compared to boomers. This, of course, is anathema to many young women&nbsp;— prospective partners — who are only becoming <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/649826/exploring-young-women-leftward-expansion.aspx">more socially progressive</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new model of masculinity</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Male disillusionment is a tightly wound knot composed of the pressure to adhere to traditional masculine ideals, socialization, and media narratives that perpetuate these stereotypes. There’s also just the universal human longing for companionship and connection. Instead of denying their feelings and need for intimate connections, men could embrace friendship and camaraderie and make attempts to be vulnerable with a diverse array of people. Not only would men feel more emotionally fulfilled, but they’d be better practiced in opening up to potential romantic partners, says Rabinowitz. They’d also <a href="https://www.vox.com/23130613/fewer-friends-how-many">probably be happier</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Shedding the rigid structures of masculinity requires bucking against socialization. It means, for men, giving yourself permission to be sad, to yearn, to be disappointed, to deeply feel without shame, Rabinowitz says. It also means taking responsibility for how their actions might contribute to their situation. Instead of blaming women for rejecting them, they could better pinpoint where they went wrong: <a href="https://www.vox.com/relationships/411480/bad-first-dates-quitting-apps-blind-dating-questions">not showing curiosity for their date</a> or being misaligned on values. “What I find is that once guys start feeling comfortable with themselves, they attract partners, they attract dates, they attract people to them,” Rabinowitz says. “My philosophy has been, get to know yourself really well, so you know your strengths and weaknesses, and you know the different parts of yourself.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To help them untangle this knot of masculinity, Rabinowitz hopes men can integrate different qualities from various aspects of masculinity to forge a new framework. Rather than feel like they must be a strong and domineering head of the family or relinquish masculinity entirely, can men adopt qualities that blend strength with openness? What kind of partner might this kind of man attract?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“That includes being open and vulnerable and compassionate, but also being strong and having strong values, and working hard and pressing through problems, and taking responsibility,” Rabinowitz says. “It&#8217;s not one or the other.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“My value is more based off of how I make other people feel,” Mike says. “Do I make them feel happy? Do they like being around me?”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In his lowest moments, Mike, a 32-year-old who lives in Portland, looked to the manosphere for advice. Constantly preoccupied with his singleness, Mike, who declined to share his last name in order to speak about his love life, felt depressed most of the time and Tate and Peterson’s masculine, vaguely self-improving messaging appealed to him. “You got to be a man. Just worry about money, getting rich,” Mike says, “and then from that point on, you can pick all the girls you want.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Mike made an effort to foster social connections through a local badminton league, he realized very few women cared about how much money he made. Being a good friend, an upbeat, socially engaged person, is what will attract a partner. His value doesn’t come from his height, or his salary, his looks, or the car he drives, he says. “My value is more based off of how I make other people feel,” Mike says. “Do I make them feel happy? Do they like being around me?”</p>

Before K-Anna Stephens posted her daughter’s name to the Facebook group “that name is a tragedeigh,” she knew that the response wasn’t going to be kind.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before K-Anna Stephens posted her daughter’s name to the Facebook group “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/199160118146465/">that name is a tragedeigh</a>,” she knew that the response wasn’t going to be kind. Internet strangers aren’t usually known for being nice, and  the more than 154,000 group members  were gathered specifically to mock and judge “tragic names.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Stephens herself knows how hard it is to have a distinctive name. Named after a grandmother and distant relative (Kay + Anna), she’s heard all kinds of pronunciations and remarks, and dealt with the never-ending headache of trying to submit the dash in “K-Anna” on government websites and filing systems. Still, she says, at almost 30 years old, she’s become desensitized to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, even K-Anna Stephens, with her three decades of unique name experience, didn’t know just how mean the internet could get when it came to her daughter’s name: Sadilynn.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s Say-di-lynne,” Stephens tells Vox of the pronunciation. “After the first 10 or 20 comments, I turned the comments off and tried to forget about the post.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sadilynn, Stephens says, came about because she liked the name “Sadie” pronounced like Sadie Hawkins. A relative told her he had a dog named Sadie, which prompted her to add -lynn, combining her first choice with another name she liked. In 2016, when Sadilynn was born, Stephens says she noticed parents using  -eigh and -lynn sounds in their children’s names and followed the trend.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When she submitted Sadilynn to the Facebook group — and it’s worth noting, there’s a similar congregation on Reddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/">r/Tragedeigh</a>, with 764,000 weekly users — she was looking for constructive criticism. What she got was a deluge of insults about her education, her sanity, her finances, her employment status, and her lack of compassion for her daughter.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“How would I put that into words? Like, <em>Oh, my God, she&#8217;s one of those people</em>. <em>Was she on drugs during pregnancy</em>? <em>What was going through her head</em>?” Stephens tells me. “Those comments, they’re quite literally what’s in the back of my head.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternatively spelled names are a peculiar trend — inherently hard to track, since uniqueness is a key factor. But they&#8217;re undoubtedly inspiring both copycats and vitriol, often rising into the public consciousness through mockery. What’s behind the drive to create these one-in-a-billion names? Why do they garner so much abuse, so much that they can sustain multiple internet forums with six-figure memberships? What do they mean for the children who bear them, and why do they make unrelated adult strangers so, so, so very upset? </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As with so many things we dislike, our ire says a lot more about us than it does about any child named Sadilynn.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Jetsyn? That’s a beautiful name for a girl!&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to baby name experts and <a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2022/6/6/23156718/byu-professor-figures-out-what-sets-utah-name-apart-from-rest-of-us/">linguists</a>, the insertion of Ys or addition of features like a -lynne or -eigh to a more common, already-existing name are part of a trend known as “alternatively spelled” or “uniquely spelled” names,  more colloquially and less professionally referred to as “Utah Mom” names.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Utah is sort of an early warning system for things that are going to become popular,” Cleveland Evans, a professor and former president of the American Name Society, told NPR earlier this year when speaking about the rise of <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/2025-05-12/oaklee-oakley-oakleigh-parents-branch-out-to-oak-based-names-especially-in-red-states">Oaklynne, Oaklee, Oakleigh,</a> and its variants. Perhaps the most internet famous example of Utah Mom naming conventions is “<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/chalk-board-mom-baby-name-laikynn-now-rcna201592">Chalkboard Mom</a>” aka Beehive State resident McKinli Hatch, who went viral standing beside a list of names like “Mckarty” and “Nayvie.” (She chose “Lakynn.”)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the naming phenomenon is not exactly exclusive to or even born from Utahns.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In July, the <a href="https://x.com/BlueJays/status/1947438638285148331">Toronto Blue Jays</a> honored pitcher Jeff Hoffman, who was born in New York, with a bobblehead giveaway. Accompanying Hoffman for the first pitch that night were his sons Tytan and Houstyn and his daughters Jetsyn and Lennyn. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Technically, it’s not a new concept,” says <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/753966/naming-bebe-by-colleen-slagen/">Colleen Slagen</a>, a baby name consultant, of the desire to purposely switch up conventional the spelling of a name and create a new one in the process. Slagen says that riffing on names goes back to the Puritans, the first Americans. The tradition goes back even further to William Shakespeare who Slagen says invented the name Jessica, the 775th most-popular girls’ name in 2025 as of this writing, according to <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/baby-names/details/jessica-2290">Babycenter</a>. Some scholars speculate that <a href="https://www.americannamesociety.org/about-names-shakespeare-invented-the-name-jessica/">Shakespeare anglicized the name</a> from the original Hebrew name “Jesca.” </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2234207538.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Jessica Simspon at a Paramount event." title="Jessica Simspon at a Paramount event." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;A famous Jessica!&lt;/p&gt; | Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the way we think of Oakleigh now is how Shakespeare’s peers thought of Jessica back in 1598. Maybe we’d think of Oakleighs differently if playwrights, poets, and pilgrims were the people trial-ballooning these monikers, instead of people we see on Instagram.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“These days, this style — intentionally changing the traditional spelling of a name — is getting more popularized through social media and influencers,” Slagen says. Familiarity breeds likeness. For those who enjoy an influencers’ aesthetics and see their lives as aspirational, a baby name is just one more facet of their lives to admire and perhaps copy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the names people are selecting to jazz up already exist, and spelling them differently gives them enough of a twist without going too far. “This is a way to choose a name that looks unique, but doesn’t sound unique — like spelling the name Peyton Paytyn,” Slagen says. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The motivation to spell a name differently may go beyond the craving for quirkiness. Taylor Humphrey, a <a href="https://www.whatsinababyname.com/">baby name consultant</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whatsinababyname">expert</a> in the immense world of things parents call their children, explains that certain sounds and features in names can connote things like femininity and masculinity. Changing the spelling of a traditional boy’s name and implementing a feminine feature can upend the binary.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The switch can offer “daughters the strength of masculine name, while simultaneously feminizing the name so as to make it clear it was a <em>girl&#8217;s name</em>,” Humphrey tells Vox. She explained that in the 1930s, increasingly popular names like Dolores, Frances, Florence, Beatrice, Gladys had the masculine “s” sound that appeared in historical names found in ancient Rome (e.g., Aurelius). </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Humphrey expanded on this theory, noting that more popular masculine names today end with a “n” sound (e.g., Benjamin, Tristan, Hudson). If parents want a name that has that girly twist on a traditional boy name, it would mean finding a way to incorporate that “n” sound. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think girl moms are once again opting for that masculine strength, and included the ‘n’ ending on names that may have otherwise ended in <em>a</em> or <em>y</em>.” Emily, then, becomes Emmersyn; Oakley, Oaklyn; and Trista, Tristan, or Tristyn.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need to talk about Bradleigh</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether it’s Sadilynn or Oaklee or Houstyn, these names strike a nerve. Jokes, insults, unserious accusations of “<a href="https://x.com/JetSetEsq/status/1948120703984865291">child abuse</a>,” concern about future <a href="https://x.com/Jburns404/status/1947965318623608968">bullying</a>, and comparisons to the characters from George R.R. Martin’s <a href="https://x.com/maxtmcc/status/1948219535170932862"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> tend to follow. With some regularity, they make their way to the Tragedeigh forums of Facebook and Reddit. Why all the anger?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While these names are still too new to be studied thoroughly, the existing research on how the general public views unique names isn’t too promising. It might explain, though, why people get so mad.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn’t.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over and over, researchers have found that people tend to judge others more <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Laham2012TNPEW.pdf">favorably</a> and as more <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2014/02/26/uc-irvine-led-study-finds-truthiness-in-peoples-names/">trustworthy</a> when they have easy-to-pronounce, familiar names (famously to the disadvantage of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2014/03/american-names-immigrants-benefit-economically-from-cultural-assimilation.html">immigrants</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/11/1243713272/resume-bias-study-white-names-black-names">people of color</a>). It seems that Americans are more likely to trust doctors and accountants with names like Pete and Laura rather than leave their taxes and health to Houstyns and Everleighs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">People like things they know, and don’t seem to trust other people’s novelty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“English doesn’t always have consistent spelling rules,” Humphrey says. “When parents add -eigh or swap in a y, it can feel like breaking the social contract of ‘how names <em>should</em> be spelled.’” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ashleigh Zosel-Harper has dealt with that disconnect her entire life. She says that about once a month, she’ll get asked why she spells her name with an -eigh instead of <em>Ashley</em>. It’s a question that her parents, whom she says wanted a more feminine version of the name, would be better equipped to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of curiosity though, may be specific to millennial Zosel-Harper’s age. In the late ’80s, <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/name/ashley/top/united-states">“Ashley” boomed in popularity</a>, and became the more common variation. “Ashleigh” had a small rise in popularity in the <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/name/ashleigh/top/united-states">early ’90s</a>, right after the “Ashley” boom — perhaps a reflection of how unique spellings are a response to how popular an existing name becomes. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Zosel-Harper notes that the questions and the implication that “Ashley” is the more correct spelling, never really bothered her too much. “I think it made me feel like less of a stereotypical <em>Ashley</em>,” Zosel-Harper tells me. “I didn&#8217;t fit that stereotype super well, so it made me feel more independent of my name.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But she also says that she never really “loved” the name in either spelling (the extra letters, she says, are “kind of fussy”). There were so many Ashleys growing up, that it didn’t feel unique. It was nothing compared to her high school classmate, Bradleigh.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Bradley but spelled B-R-A-D-L-E-I-G-H? It totally blew my mind,” Zosel-Harper says.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why some people can’t stand to see an Oakleigh winning</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But sometimes the backlash is more than just playful curiosity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Humphrey, the baby name consultant, explains that a part of the backlash to these names is rooted in classism. Humphrey cited an argument from <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/08/why-we-mock-baby-names.html">The Cut</a> in 2022 when the publication explored the backlash to names like Loyal, Ozzy, Emberlyn, and theorized it was due to those names projecting an idea of being poor or uneducated, or someone poor and uneducated enough not realize that a name could convey all of those things.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn’t.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently, there’s been a growing, vocal obsession of “old money” and “quiet luxury” aesthetics. It’s the idea of elegant consumption and behavior that only people with <em>real</em> wealth and class understand and access. This refined consumerism manifests itself in accessories, clothes, cars, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/old-money-blonde-11770812">hair color</a>, schools, home goods and, even <a href="https://www.parents.com/old-money-baby-names-11767405">names</a>. (Names considered “<a href="https://parade.com/living/old-money-baby-names">old money</a>” like Amelia, Charlotte, Olivia, and Emma are all in the top 10 girls names of 2024, while Theodore, James, Henry, and William are in the top 10 boys names).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The throughline between these seemingly vast and disparate items and identifiers is understatement and tradition. Only people who understand quiet luxury will be able to spot quiet luxury, and anyone who can’t is in the out-group.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Names like Tytan, Oakleigh, Jetsynn, Lennyn, are outliers. They’re flashy, attention-grabbing, and meant to be noticed. They threaten structure and usurp tradition. Parents like Stephens are well aware of how these names are supposed to be spelled, and still don’t follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Sarah, Hannah, Emily — they&#8217;re beautiful names, but I don&#8217;t know, they’re just not for me,” Stephens says. Despite the internet furor, Stephens says hasn’t received much pushback to Sadilynn’s name in real life except for when she asks teachers and faculty not to shorten it to Sadie.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I had no intention of trying to make Sadilynn stand out,” Stephens tells me. The name “just brought me a lot of happiness.”&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why a future of Lakynns and Houstyns is unlikely&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Humphrey pointed out to me that names were each given to less than 25 girls in 2024, like Tristyn (24), Lakynn (16), and Houstyn (5). Oaklynn, perhaps one of the most popular of these “Utah Mom” names, was given to 1,898 babies. Considering there were 3.6 million births in the US, the notion of these names becoming extremely popular feels a bit exaggerated.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It might be more helpful to look at the rise of these names (and the ensuing backlash) as part of a larger trend of Americans grappling with identity and tradition. Choosing a unique spelling for a name is a way for parents to signal individuality. They’re also a way for parents to shift the way we think about gender (i.e., giving girls names that sound like boys’ names but spelled with feminine features). Those trends feel more everlasting than the names people choose. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the idea of more -y, -leigh, and -lynn names troubles you <em>that</em> greatly, there may be light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Here’s the twist: Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular,” Humphrey tells me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Essentially, there are less people naming their babies <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/blog/the-most-common-baby-names-are-far-less-common">the most popular names.</a> Today, the most common names don’t dominate the way Michaels, Jessicas, and Sarahs did decades ago. Americans still have their favorites like Liam and Olivia — the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/">top names in 2024</a> — but they aren’t as saturated.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Parents are naturally spreading out across a wider pool of options, which means the need for creative spellings may eventually solve itself,” Humphrey says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Or maybe — maybeigh — it won’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> The Trump administration has ended a federal bribery investigation into one of its top immigration officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Last year, President Donald Trump&#8217;s “border czar” Tom Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from “businessmen” — undercover FBI agents — in exchange for promising to help secure government contracts, spurring a Justice Department investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan was a private citizen when he is said to have accepted the cash, but he had boasted about playing a prominent role in a potential second Trump administration in the months leading up to the payment. The investigation was closed earlier this year by the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Homan?</strong> As border czar, Homan has been one of the public faces of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown. He served as acting ICE director in Trump’s first term, and claimed last year that he would “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What has the Trump administration said about the case?</strong> The White House denied Homan accepted the money — despite the reported existence of an audio recording of him doing so — and described the investigation into Homan as entrapment and “another example of the weaponization of the Biden DOJ.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> The Homan story — thousands in cash delivered clandestinely in a takeout bag — would be a major scandal in any other era, under any other administration. Here, it’s one data point in a growing body of evidence for the politicization of Trump’s DOJ, including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/19/trump-letitia-james-erik-siebert-virginia/">Friday resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert</a> and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/20/trump-bondi-truth-social-00574380">subsequent Truth Social post</a> by Trump calling for criminal charges against his political opponents. </p>

Support our journalism by </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-membership?itm_campaign=jan-2025-critical&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>becoming a member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During a highly anticipated announcement today, President Donald Trump urged pregnant people to avoid taking Tylenol if possible because of the painkiller’s possible link to autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, Trump promoted <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/leucovorin-oral-route-intravenous-route-injection-route/description/drg-20064503">leucovorin</a>, a decades-old medication that mimics folic acid and is often used to restore nutrients in patients who are taking chemotherapy drugs. The folate-based treatment has been investigated in a few small clinical trials as a possible therapeutic for children with autism.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before we get any further: The link between Tylenol and autism is unclear, and physician groups still <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ACOGNational/posts/acetaminophen-remains-a-safe-trusted-option-for-pain-relief-during-pregnancy-des/1180418200784501/">recommend</a> the medicine for pregnant people experiencing pain or fever, in consultation with their doctor. The link between vaccines and autism has been studied exhaustively, and <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism">no connection has been found</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Delivering leucovorin could, in theory, improve symptoms —&nbsp;and, in those small experiments, some parents and investigators have been thrilled with the results, as well as the strong safety profile.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the evidence here is also still very limited; one study involved fewer than 50 patients. It is not clear whether this drug would work for all patients on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/rfk-interview-kaitlan-collins-maha-report">promising</a> the American public answers on autism for months. But Monday’s announcement outpaces any science that could adequately back up the administration’s guidance. The National Institutes of Health has undertaken a massive review of autism science, but, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/">according to the Washington Post</a>, that research review was not completed in time for Trump’s White House announcement.’</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has long <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103">theorized</a> that there is a link between vaccines and autism, and Trump, too, indulged in the debunked theory that autism could be caused by vaccines during Monday’s announcement. Kennedy promised during the press conference to continue that search, accusing the medical establishment of “gaslighting” mothers who are concerned about the impact on their children. The Make America Healthy Again movement <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/390309/maha-rfk-make-america-healthy-again-slippery">emphasizes</a>, in general, the possibility that pharmaceutical drugs could be causing a number of health problems in America’s children.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, many autism scientists and advocates are alarmed by the administration’s announcement. The evidence linking Tylenol to autism’s development is mixed — some studies have found an association, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31664451/">a cohort study based out of Boston</a> cited by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary at the press conference. The cohort research<strong> </strong>involved 1,000 children; <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406">a 2024 study</a> that covered 2.5 million children in Sweden, however, concluded that no link&nbsp;exists.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s and Kennedy’s fixation that autism rates are rising — and that <em>something </em>must be driving that increase — misses some important context: Most autism scientists believe that increase is actually largely the result of more public awareness about autism, and the subtle ways that it can manifest, as well as a changing and expanding definition of what is classified as autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As for autism’s underlying causes, <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning">as I reported earlier this year</a>, our country’s leading autism scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with the development of autism-like symptoms. Those scientists acknowledge there may be some non-genetic factors that play a role&nbsp;— such as more people giving birth at a later age — but they dismiss previous claims by Kennedy that a single chemical toxin can explain the uptick in autism diagnoses.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House press conference “alarms us researchers who have committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said a statement from <a href="https://www.coalitionofautismscientists.org/members">the Coalition of Autism Scientists</a>. “The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we actually know about Tylenol and autism, about the autism treatment that Trump pushed in his announcement, and about what may actually be driving the increase in autism cases.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evidence linking Tylenol to autism is muddy</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump said in his Oval Office announcement that the FDA would be notifying physicians of the risk of Tylenol during pregnancy. He said repeatedly, “Don’t take it,” unless you have an extremely high fever. (Current medical guidance already stipulates that a pregnant person should talk with their doctor before taking acetaminophen for fever or pain.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some scientists have argued in recent years that there may be a link between taking Tylenol during pregnancy and the development of autism. Most recently, <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0">a systematic review of six studies on the matter</a>, co-authored by the Harvard School of Public Health’s dean in August of this year, concluded there was an association between Tylenol (also known as acetaminophen in its generic form) and the onset of autism. But finding an association is not the same thing as proving a cause, and the authors of the systematic review acknowledged this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other scientists, too, pointed out limitations with the Harvard evidence review. For one, <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0/tables/2">several of the studies included</a> were small: One involved only 215 children. Second, most were observational studies that could have difficulty controlling for confounding factors, like the parents’ genetic disposition toward autism, or other drugs the pregnant person may have taken. For example, <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/autism-risk-linked-fever-during-pregnancy">fever itself</a> is already known to be a risk factor for autism and other neurodevelopmental problems in fetuses. If a pregnant person took Tylenol to treat their fever, an observational study would struggle to differentiate between whether the pain medication or the fever contributed to a child being born with autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And lastly, by far the largest study included in the analysis — the one that covered 2.5 million children in Sweden; the next largest study involved 73,000 children across Europe — <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406">concluded</a> there was no link between Tylenol and autism after controlling for confounding factors.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When taken together, the link between Tylenol and autism is still unclear, and Monday’s announcement risks overstating the painkiller’s dangers to developing babies. “Regarding Tylenol in pregnancy, this is rushed science and not yet borne out in the data,” Stephen Scherer, director of the Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, told me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Discouraging pregnant people from taking Tylenol has its own risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the authors of the meta-analysis that showed a link argued only for judicious use of the drug, not eliminating it entirely. Pregnant people are already discouraged from taking ibuprofen because of a more serious risk of birth defects, leaving acetaminophen as their first and most reliable choice for relieving pain and fevers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we really know about the increase in autism rates</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The increase in autism diagnoses is very real: According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5601a1.htm">a sweeping 2000 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, a range of 2 to 7 per 1,000, or roughly 0.5 percent of US children, were diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. That figure has risen to one in 35 kids, or roughly 3 percent. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a long time, the process for diagnosing a person with autism was strictly based on speech development. But today we have criteria that include a wide range of social and emotional symptoms with three subtypes — the autism spectrum disorder we’re familiar with today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It makes sense, then, that as the criteria for autism expanded, more and more children would meet it, and autism rates would rise. And that’s precisely what happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other known risk factors — like more people now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/us-fertility-rates-down-teens-women-40-first-time-moms-rcna196809">having babies later in their life</a>, given that parental age is linked to a higher likelihood of autism — are more likely to be a factor than anything Kennedy has been pointing at, experts told me earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s very clear it’s not going to be one environmental toxin,” Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation and parent of a child with profound autism, told me back in May. “If there were a smoking gun, I think they would have found it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, many autism scientists continue to focus on genetics. Multiple studies have attributed about 80 percent of a person’s risk of <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/majority-of-autism-risk-resides-in-genes-multinational-study-suggests/">developing autism to their inherited genetic factors</a>. Clinical trials for gene-based therapies are getting underway, offering another avenue for providing relief to patients and families&nbsp; —&nbsp;but one that Kennedy, who called genetics a dead end for understanding autism, and the Trump administration have so far ignored.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration itself seems to acknowledge that Tylenol is far from a smoking gun; that’s why the NIH’s research efforts are still ongoing. But after promising for months to deliver some kind of answer on autism, this seems to be the best they could come up with. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Peruse the self-help aisle at your local neighborhood bookstore, and you’ll likely find tomes giving you all kinds of advice.

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the <a href="https://www.ifbookspod.com/">critiques</a> of the <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/self-improvement-market-recovers-from-the-pandemic-worth-13.4-billion-in-the-u.s">multibillion-dollar self-help industry</a>, it sells, launching the <a href="https://www.melrobbins.com/">high-profile careers</a> of authors and influencers and <a href="https://therulesbook.com/">ways of life</a> for its followers. What is it about self-help that we find irresistible?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the question author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro set out to answer with her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Land-Journey-Americas-Self-Help/dp/1439100195"><em>Promise Land: My Journey Through America&#8217;s Self-Help Culture</em></a>. It’s a topic she has personal investment in. “My dad was a child psychologist, and he wrote parenting books. And I later found out that he used me as an example,” she says. Her experience left her skeptical of self-help culture, so she set out to explore it by trying the guidance in several self-help guides.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Though her experience was unique, she says it’s not all that different from the culture of self-help we all interact with. “That kind of stuff percolates, even if you&#8217;re not reading self-help books,” Lamb tells Vox. “It’s so woven into the fabric of our experience that I think everyone grew up with self-help, even if they didn&#8217;t grow up reading self-help books or having a self-help book writer for a dad.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems that when it comes to self-improvement, we just can’t help ourselves. But is this attempt at optimization actually leading to our isolation? That’s what we discuss on this week’s episode of <em>Explain It to Me</em>, Vox’s weekly call-in podcast.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Lamb-Shapiro, edited for length and clarity.

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How long have self-help books been around?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first incarnation of self-help was in the mid-1800s. There was a writer named Samuel Smiles. He wrote for the Leeds Times, and there was a society called the Mutual Improvement Society. They invited him to give a lecture, and he told these anecdotes about working men rising from poverty into positions of power. It was hugely successful. People loved the stories. So he started doing more and more lectures and then eventually made it into a book. The book was called <em>Self-Help</em>. It came out in 1859. It was immediately a bestseller. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So it was popular way before I thought. You can also find predecessors in the Greek Stoics, from around 160, 180 AD. There was a Roman emperor named Marcus Aurelius who wrote a book called <em>Meditations</em>. That book is actually sold as a self-help book today. If you go to your bookstore and you look in the self-help section, you could find Marcus Aurelius’s self-help.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Every man I know reads about stoicism. So yes, I do know that name quite well.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was writing the book, I was like, oh, this is <em>Don&#8217;t Sweat the Small Stuff.</em> Do you remember that book?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a bestselling book when I was growing up — so ’80s, ’90s. And it basically is the same thing with a different, more dire message: “We&#8217;re all going to die one day, so who cares?” It’s repackaged for today&#8217;s happy America, but it is basically the same message. So any self-help book you find today, there&#8217;s always a predecessor of a hundred years or earlier.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How big is the self-help industry?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The global self-help industry is worth <a href="https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-personal-development-market">between $45 billion and $59 billion</a>. It&#8217;s also called personal growth or self-improvement, not always self-help. And this isn&#8217;t just books, but it&#8217;s also courses and TikToks and affirmation-a-day calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You did all of this work, and part of it was to find out if self-help books are a scam. Are they?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a very difficult question. I wouldn&#8217;t say that they&#8217;re a scam. There are so many self-help books. There&#8217;s good ones, there&#8217;s bad ones, there&#8217;s bad ones that have some good qualities. If you don&#8217;t take everything as gospel, you can kind of pick and choose what&#8217;s helpful and what&#8217;s not helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why are we so drawn to these books?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that whatever your life is, it could be better is really appealing. You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster. It&#8217;s just an idea that&#8217;s very appealing to us as human beings: that we could just be more awesome than we are right now or have more awesome stuff than we have right now. I mean, I&#8217;m always trying to do things better. I&#8217;m trying to learn, I&#8217;m trying to be smarter. I&#8217;m trying to be more social, leave my house more, be a better dog owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It&#8217;s interesting because you started out pretty skeptical of self-help, going into writing this book. Do you still feel that way or have you found redeeming things in it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ve definitely found redeeming things in it. I also absolutely think you should always retain a bit of skepticism and a little bit of cynicism when you&#8217;re encountering self-help. I was in my 30s when I wrote the book. I&#8217;m in my 40s now, and a lot has happened politically and socially. The pandemic happened, and those were some tough times for me and for everybody. So I feel like I have a lot more sympathy for the urge to self-help and the idea of it, even if it doesn&#8217;t get realized in the books.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What&#8217;s changed about self-help in recent years? Anything at all?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that self-help has&nbsp;become better and more mainstream. I&#8217;m thinking of someone like Brené Brown, who is an academic researcher and actually has studies to back up the things she&#8217;s saying, but also is sometimes seen as a self-help writer. Certainly, her books have helped people. So there&#8217;s kind of an elevation of the discussion, where it&#8217;s a little bit more intellectual. I think that appeals to more people. They&#8217;ve brought in a whole new audience to self-help, and I think in a way the books have become better as a result.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you think we&#8217;re overdoing it on self-help? Are we trying too hard to fully optimize ourselves to be our best selves?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, absolutely. I think we&#8217;re obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s healthy, necessarily. Self-help books are appealing if you’re thinking, “I&#8217;m going to go to therapy for years and I&#8217;m going to spend thousands of dollars, or I could just buy this book for 20 bucks, and feel better immediately, and maybe get something out of it.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We&#8217;re obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s healthy, necessarily.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;But I think we&#8217;re really losing the community aspect. When you&#8217;re talking about self-help, everything is done by yourself. When you do that, you lose the opportunity to have a community and to strengthen your relationships with other people. When I try to help myself on my own, I&#8217;m still by myself. Whereas if I ask for help, I am strengthening my relationships, and I&#8217;m getting a lot more out of it than just the help that I was looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That sense of community is really important, and so many people are feeling lonely and alienated. To actually make contact with another person or an organization is really beneficial. Not just to society — because it&#8217;s definitely beneficial to society to have people invested in the community — but also to the individual to feel like they have community support and they&#8217;re not just completely isolated and alone.</p>

We have books getting published like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Married-Americans-Families-Civilization/dp/0063210851"><em>Get Married</em></a>: <em>Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization</em> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Parent-Privilege-Americans-Stopped-Getting/dp/0226817784/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dz5a4x6-iU2iMt7uHM2-GFO4f0nITcj6exfBYMcPdtrzUeuzyPJUPnmgmRcf24PdbUeZZNsKJUOusR-Zf3whaE1v3qx2KoycoEV6TK43Lroz4edIsXE1nsUVc4gv-9Q1v8KvyDa4ahVNxUvtQPgDVw.iytoPlBC6D38yq-YNrcBUowc55GlX56yG54tMmQNgIk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=693355919886&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=67&amp;hvlocphy=9007538&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=11731164257905207372--&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11731164257905207372&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2086404357326&amp;hydadcr=22163_13517541&amp;keywords=the+two-parent+privilege&amp;mcid=727f6a60e1da387ea93ed239aa14783f&amp;qid=1758015260&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Two-Parent Privilege</em></a><em>: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind</em>. Social conservatives are talking about establishing a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/03/heritage-foundation-parents-children-birth/">“Manhattan Project” for boosting birth rates</a> and nuclear families, and some on the right are even musing about <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/354635/divorce-no-fault-states-marriage-republicans">ending no-fault divorce</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sociologist Christina Cross’s new book, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674278493"><em>Inherited Inequality</em></a>: <em>Why Opportunity Gaps Persist Between Black and White Youth Raised in Two-Parent Families</em>, seeks to challenge these stories and solutions. Cross studies the outcomes of kids who grow up in two-parent Black families — a group of people she argues tends to “escape our collective imagination” — despite all the intense focus on single-parent households.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cross’s work bucks an idea that has fundamentally shaped government policy since the Moynihan Report in 1965 through welfare reform and contemporary marriage promotion initiatives: that if Black families just got married and stayed together, racial inequality would largely disappear. Her research reveals that Black kids raised by two parents still struggle far more than white kids from two-parent families, and do only about as well as white kids who only had one parent at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The numbers are stark. Black children in two-parent homes were two to four times more likely to get suspended or kicked out of school than white children with both parents. When it came time for college, there was a 25-point gap between how many Black versus white kids from two-parent families actually enrolled. By their mid-20s, Black young adults from these families were three times more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite representing half of all Black children in America, these two-parent Black families have been virtually ignored by researchers — just two out of 163 family structure studies published in leading journals between 2012 and 2022 examined their outcomes. Cross and senior correspondent Rachel Cohen Booth discussed the hidden costs of America’s marriage promotion spending, the research gaps that have allowed myths about Black families to persist, and why even two-parent Black households can’t escape structural racism. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Your research strongly suggests that promoting these traditional two-parent families is not going to reduce racial inequality, but you do find some advantages for Black children raised in these kinds of households. Given that, do you think encouraging marriage is still a worthy policy goal or cultural aim, even if it doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems marriage advocates claim it could?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things I focus on in my book is that there’s been such a singular emphasis on promoting marriage and the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, and that this laser focus on this one intervention really limits our ability to close gaps between groups.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My research shows that even amongst Black and white children in two-parent families, inequality is very high. So the question we need to be asking ourselves is: Is this the best use of our time, attention, and resources? And are there other strategies and interventions that we could be focusing on that might be more effective? And my research suggests that yes, that is the case.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A lot of people probably will wonder why we should object to something that yes, isn’t a silver bullet, but still seems to offer some help and protection. But I think you do find costs and consequences to this approach. Could you just walk me through the costs you see of prioritizing a focus on two-parent families?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So one cost, as I was mentioning, is that when we focus simply on promoting two-parent families, it limits our ability to explore other strategies that could be more effective. There are also real economic costs as well. Many people are surprised to find that currently our federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year promoting marriage and the two-parent families.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, is our largest cash assistance program in the US, and this program has outlined four goals, three of which focus on promoting marriage and the two-parent family. The government spends between $250 and $400 million each year on these efforts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re in a moment where federal funding for key safety net programs is being cut drastically. With the limited resources that are available, might we be more effective at improving children&#8217;s outcomes and reducing gaps between groups by offering direct cash assistance or assistance for child care subsidies or for education or so many other really important things that families need?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In your book you identified a theory called the Family Resource Perspective as the principal framework used by social scientists and family demographers to explain how family structure influences well-being, which seems to basically boil down to more parents raising a kid means more money and more hands on deck. That sounds intuitive, certainly, but can you talk a little bit about how your research complicates that framework?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Family Resource Perspective really emphasizes how having two parents in the home leads to more resources, more income, more wealth, more time to spend with children. But one of the things that often gets overlooked and that I highlight in my research is that these key resources are not evenly distributed, not everyone in two parent families has access to them. And unfortunately, that is especially the case when we look at Black two-parent families.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So I found that when it comes to income, Black two-parent families had about 60 percent of the income of white two-parent families and only 25 percent of the wealth. And so when we&#8217;re thinking about how important these resources are for improving child outcomes, we need to remember that if we don&#8217;t have equal inputs, we cannot expect equal outcomes,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I know this wasn&#8217;t directly in your book, but I was curious. What do we know about kids who grow up in more affluent, divorced families?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Actually, that&#8217;s a next step for me and my own research that I want to explore. Because we tend to focus on average differences. So on average, two-parent families have more resources than single-parent families. But what would it look like for a child to be raised in a single-parent family that was high-income? Or that even included other adults in the household who may not be a biological parent but who could help with child rearing? We can imagine that if resources are really driving family structures&#8217; impact on children, then more resources, and more adults in the household, could lead to better outcomes for children, even if they don&#8217;t grow up in a two-parent family.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In that same vein, what if anything did you find regarding bad marriages? Do we know if they bring any kind of different level of harm or benefit to children compared to divorce or single parenthood?</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“My work shows that even when Black people raise their children in two-parent families, inequality is still very high.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I didn&#8217;t focus specifically on marriage quality, but we know that not all marriages are created equally. It really is important to keep that in mind because we know that a child who is in a household where there is a significant amount of stress and conflict is going to be negatively impacted by that. That&#8217;s not from my own research, but there are a number of studies that do show that.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You found that Black two-parent families have increased by 15 percent over the last decade, whereas Black single-mother families have declined by roughly the same amount. What do you think is driving that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You know, it&#8217;s funny because as I was doing background research for my book, I was surprised to find this because the story has been for so long that Black two-parent families are so small and we talk about them as if they don&#8217;t even exist. So I was surprised to find that they&#8217;re increasing and actually for every Black child who lives in a single-mother family, there&#8217;s a Black child who&#8217;s growing up in a two-parent family, but so much of our focus has been on single-parent families. And so in uncovering this finding, I&#8217;m also curious to know what&#8217;s driving it. For my book, I was not pursuing that direction, but that&#8217;s actually one of the next things on my research agenda as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You have this pretty striking statistic that between 2012 and 2022, there were 163 articles published on family structure effects in the five leading family studies journals, but just two of them looked at the outcomes of Black youth in two-parent families. Why do you think that is? Were you surprised to find that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I was very surprised. I mean, I had a sense that there was less research on Black two-parent families just based on where much of our conversation currently sits focused on Black single-parent families. But to find that there were so few studies, I mean, two out of more than 160, it&#8217;s just very striking. We&#8217;ve really only begun to scratch the surface of understanding what it means to live with two parents in the home for Black children, and there&#8217;s very little empirical evidence to support some very strong claims about the power of the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, which is why I decided to write this book.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I wanted to be able to provide some foundational facts for us to have a more accurate conversation about the role of the two-parent family and improving child outcomes and addressing one of our most intractable issues, which is racial inequality. And unfortunately, I&#8217;m finding that this family structure cannot do what we imagine that it should be doing. And that&#8217;s really, really important.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Given your critiques of America’s current approach, what policies or cultural shifts would you recommend to better help Black families and children?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So I think about these things as being two-pronged. As you mentioned, part of this is about culture and then the other part is about structure. So when thinking about culture, I think it&#8217;s important to remember the power of narrative, the power of story, because it shapes the way we think about problems and how to address them. And for so long, we&#8217;ve had a cultural narrative that says that the main reason that Black people have a harder time getting ahead is because they don&#8217;t live in the “right” type of family, that they&#8217;re less likely to raise their children within the context of a two-parent family. And as we can see in terms of our federal programming like TANF, that has led us to focus on trying to promote this family structure.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“There&#8217;s been such a focus on the nuclear family in terms of how we craft social policy. And sometimes that actually limits our ability to support families that might arrange themselves differently.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My work shows that even when Black people raise their children in two-parent families, inequality is still very high. So part of what I hope to do in my book is to change the narrative, to present evidence that we really have not had access to because there has been so few studies on Black two-parent families. So that&#8217;s the cultural component.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But also in thinking about structure, I think it&#8217;s important for us to know that one of the main reasons why there are such huge opportunity gaps between Black and white children is that there are huge gaps in resources. Right now, we&#8217;re in a moment in which many social safety net programs are being cut — like SNAP, Medicaid, and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program. These changes in our structure are likely to widen many of the gaps that I witnessed in my book.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve seen recently some strategies that have been effective that we could potentially implement. One of them in particular is the expanded Child Tax Credit, which lifted millions of kids out of poverty in the pandemic. Another policy is marriage penalties. For some couples, it costs them more in taxes when they file as a married household than if they were to file as single individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I know a lot of conservatives </strong><a href="https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/understanding-marriage-penalties-welfare-and-their-impact-society"><strong>want to get rid of those penalties</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s true. And so that could be one strategy, but also leveraging existing assets of families. There&#8217;s been such a focus on the nuclear family in terms of how we craft social policy. And sometimes that actually limits our ability to support families that might arrange themselves differently. Black Americans are more likely to live in extended families, and there are some policies that would limit Black families’ ability to provide support to one another in this arrangement. Family leave policy, as an example: With family leave policy, folks are allowed to take leave to take care of a nuclear family member, like a spouse or child, but some people are responsible for taking care of their parents or grandparents. They might be in a situation where they&#8217;re living with siblings or cousins or other individuals who are not necessarily considered within the family leave policy. And that means that when it comes to taking care of them, they have to choose between missing out on pay.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Last year, you came in the crosshairs of Christopher Rufo, who labeled you a “Black Critical Race Theory/DEI scholar” and leveled charges of plagiarism. I know the scholars from whom you were accused of plagiarizing have </strong><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/22/cross-plagiarism-harvard-anonymous-complaint/"><strong>all rejected</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/25/cross-plagiarism-colleagues-support/"><strong>the allegations</strong></a><strong>. Harvard’s sociology department </strong><a href="https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/news/public-statement-attacks-christina-cross%E2%80%99s-scholarship-harvard-university-department"><strong>rejected it</strong></a><strong>, the head of Plagiarism Today rejected it, and the American Sociological Association </strong><a href="https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/asa-statement-in-defense-of-christina-cross-march-2024.pdf"><strong>also rejected it</strong></a><strong>. What did you make of this kind of attack on your work, and were you surprised?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, in moments like this, I think even being singled out really speaks to the work that I&#8217;ve been doing and the fact that it has had reach outside of academia. We know that Chris Rufo is not an academic. And so, as difficult as that moment was, what that really signals to me is that I have been able to contribute to national conversations and hopefully to be able to help generate more productive conversations. And I plan on continuing to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And as you mentioned, there was so much widespread support for the work that I was doing inside and outside of academia, which I found to just be very encouraging and heartening. And so I&#8217;m gonna continue to do the work, and I&#8217;m very excited to see what will come of this book that I have written for a much broader audience.</p>

Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. Even the good news, on the rare occasion we get some, feels hollow. But for the most part, it’s bad news. The planet keeps heating up.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. Even the good news, on the rare occasion we get some, feels hollow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But for the most part, it’s bad news. The planet keeps heating up. So many of the disasters we were warned about years ago are starting to pile on. Meanwhile, the oil keeps flowing, the politicians keep punting, and the systems meant to save us keep failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we’re staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency and the potential unraveling of what little climate progress we’ve made. But there’s a twist: Solar and wind are booming, and they’re now the world’s cheapest energy sources. Many cities, towns, and in some cases countries are running almost entirely on renewables. That is all <em>great</em> news.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But what does it actually mean? Is it too late to turn this thing around?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Bill McKibben is one of the most influential voices on the climate over the past four decades. He sounded the alarm in his 1989 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812976088?ref=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;bestFormat=true&amp;csmig=1"><em>The End of Nature</em></a>, which many consider a foundational text of the modern environmentalist movement. He’s also founded organizations like Third Act and <a href="http://350.org">350.org</a>, the latter of which remains one of the biggest climate activist groups in the world.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">His new book, <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Here-Comes-the-Sun/"><em>Here Comes the Sun</em></a>, is about the revolution in solar and wind power and it might be the most hopeful thing he’s ever written. And that’s because we now have the tools we need to tackle this problem. The question is, do we have the political will to do it?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited McKibben onto <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about that and the many possibilities in front of us. As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This book is much more optimistic than I expected. It doesn’t feel forced; it feels like you’re genuinely excited about what’s possible.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an odd moment for me. Much of what I’ve been describing since <em>The End of Nature</em> in the late ’80s is now happening in real time. We’re watching the climate system come apart. Politically, I don’t think I’ve lived through a bleaker period. And yet, at the same time, I have news of one big good thing: a transformation in how we make and use energy that’s actually moving fast enough to matter. So I get to be the bearer of some good news, for once.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You’re clear that we’re past being able to “stop” global warming. So what’s the plausible goal now?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Stopping warming entirely isn’t on the menu. What might still be on the menu is stopping it short of the point where it cuts civilization off at the knees. That’s the goal here. Recent science about the jet stream, the Gulf stream, and the atmosphere’s moisture content is scary. These are enormous systems with momentum. But every tenth of a degree matters. Each tenth we avoid keeps tens or hundreds of millions of people within a livable climate zone. That remains the biggest task humans have ever had: Keep the damage within survivable limits.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Right — this isn’t binary. Degrees matter. Fractions of degrees matter.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why the clean energy news is so important. I’ve covered this long enough to feel the ground shifting, and the pace has surprised even people in the climate and energy world. California, which is the fourth-largest economy on Earth, has quietly hit a tipping point. On many days, it supplies more than 100 percent of its power for long stretches from clean energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When the sun goes down, batteries that spent the afternoon soaking up surplus sunshine now become the biggest source of electricity. The net result is that California used about 40 percent less natural gas for electricity this summer than two years ago. If that spreads globally, you start shaving tenths of a degree off the future. That’s the best number I’ve heard in almost 40 years of doing this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We’re talking in mid-August, more than six months into President Donald Trump’s second term. He ran promising to “drill, baby, drill” and to kneecap electric vehicles. Has he delivered?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s doing extraordinary damage and he’s doing it with the spineless support of a lot of Republicans who know better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll make two points. First, this is a global crisis and a global energy market. What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here<em>.</em> We invented the solar cell and the lithium-ion battery. Now we’re practically handing the future to Beijing on a platter. In the long run, that might still be good for the planet because they’re pushing these technologies everywhere, but it’s a staggering abdication by the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, even here at home, the story isn’t finished. The most interesting state in America for energy right now is Texas. It’s installing renewables faster than California. In the spring, fossil fuel interests tried to ram through a “DEI for gas” bill, which is basically forcing one unit of gas buildout for every unit of solar. People in rural Texas came out of the woodwork to say, <em>Don’t do this.</em> Wind and solar keep schools open, fund elder care. These are real, tangible benefits. The legislature backed down. So even in red states, the economics and the local benefits are changing the politics.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And one reason I’m optimistic is that a lot of this is now mundane economics. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey. It’s the Costco of energy: cheap, abundant, on the shelf, ready to go.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The federal picture is obviously grim. The EPA under Trump revoked a long-held scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, which is the legal basis for a lot of climate regulation. Is this as bad as it looks? Do you think the courts will stop it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It will be challenged. We’ll see what happens. But it’s an “up is down” administration. They insist DC is a crime-ridden hellscape when the data say otherwise, and they insist climate’s no big deal as entire neighborhoods burn, as Texas floods, as wildfire smoke becomes a seasonal feature in the East, and as we log the hottest months in recorded history. But physics doesn’t care about press releases. The danger is the damage they can do in the meantime. So we can’t just rely on the superior economics of solar, wind, and batteries. We also need activism to change laws and minds. There’s a lot that states and cities can do — even with Washington hostile.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Give me a concrete example.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rooftop solar in the US costs roughly three times as much, and takes far longer, than in many other countries. In Australia, you can call on Monday and have panels up by Friday; 40 percent of homes there have rooftop solar. The difference isn’t the price of panels; it’s our baroque, Byzantine permitting across 15,000 municipalities. We’re treating a safe, standardized appliance like it’s a bespoke construction project. The National Renewable Energy Lab built an instant-permitting tool — SolarAPP+ — and states like California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted it. We should scale that everywhere.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another example is “balcony solar.” In the past two years, millions of Europeans — apartment-dwellers! — have bought a plug-in panel that hangs off the balcony and instantly supplies around 20 percent of a home’s power. That’s illegal across the US, except in Utah, where a libertarian state senator asked the obvious question: Why can Hamburg do it but Provo can’t? The law changed unanimously. Now you can find people in Utah happily plugging in balcony panels and watching the meter spin backward.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why did so many people — including environmentalists — so badly underestimate how fast solar and wind would scale?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For decades, fossil energy was cheap and renewable energy was expensive. That got lodged in our heads. Even climate advocates focused on things like carbon taxes to raise fossil prices so renewables could compete. But about four or five years ago we crossed an invisible line and people didn’t update. Today, it’s often twice as cheap to make power from sun as from fire.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want a date, I’d circle June 2023. That’s when global temperatures began their latest spike. Some of the hottest months in at least 125,000 years, and it’s also the month humanity started installing a gigawatt of solar every day. Since then the pace has only accelerated. In April, China alone was installing around 3 gigawatts per day, which is the equivalent of a coal plant’s capacity every eight hours.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In your book, you note that in 2022, China spent 26 times as much on the clean energy supply chain as Europe and the US combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was starting to narrow that gap. With Trump back, how dramatically will that change? Will we get anywhere close to that expected number or will China just continue to lap us?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ll lap us. The IRA was our best chance to catch up; parts may survive, but a lot won’t. Twenty years from now, the US may be a kind of theme park where tourists come to see how people used to make energy by setting things on fire. Eventually, we’ll try to catch up, but we won’t be owning that future anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I wanted to ask about movement politics since you’ve been so involved for so long. For decades, climate politics was about stopping bad things — pipelines, leases, drilling. But the economics have flipped. The movement now has to be about building. What does that shift look like?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been writing for a year that people like me — old white guys — should stop reflexively suing to block projects we don’t like. It’s absurd to block solar farms because you don’t like looking at them. The imperative is to make it easier to build the clean stuff. That’s why we’re focused on permitting reform at the local and state level.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Washington is a write-off for the moment; rational thought has left the building. But states — red and blue — can move. Texas and Utah show it. And the appeal is broad. If you’re a “my home is my castle” American, solar makes that literally truer; if you love the idea of a network powered by something elegant and natural, you’re on board for different reasons. Small versus big is the fault line — not left versus right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why did this become a red-blue cultural fight when it really doesn’t have to be?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fossil fuel industry spent decades and billions making it partisan. The Koch network effectively bought one of our political parties. Fifty years ago, environmentalism was bipartisan. [Republican President Richard] Nixon signed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and created the EPA under pressure from the first Earth Day. The science has been clear since the ’80s, and the oil companies knew. They treated it as a threat to their business model, not to the planet, and were willing to wreck our democracy as well as our atmosphere to defend it. The wild card is that we’ve now introduced the cheapest, most beautiful form of energy into this mix and that changes the politics.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>“Beautiful” isn’t a word people associate with utility-scale power — but you lean into it.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It matters! The sun already gives us light, warmth, and photosynthesis. Now it can power everything else. People respond to that. The Vatican just announced it’s building a solar farm outside Rome that will make the Vatican the first fully solar-powered nation. That’s not just a tech story; it’s a civilizational story. Big Oil is still powerful, but a lot of what they’re pushing — like leaning on countries to lock themselves into US liquefied natural gas — may backfire. If you’re Indonesia or Vietnam, do you really want to tie your future energy supply to a fickle superpower? Or do you want to harvest the sun and wind that fall on your own land and sea?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s a perverse wrinkle here: Sun and wind are so cheap they don’t fit neatly into a profit model built on scarcity.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an investment problem for some incumbents. Returns aren’t as juicy as selling fuel forever. But for countries, cheap power is a competitive advantage. If you can run your industries on electricity, your economy hums. That’s what China is aiming at. Meanwhile, if the US insists on expensive options — coal, gas, or boutique nuclear — we handicap ourselves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You also make the blunt point that breaking the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a big deal if we do want a more humane politics. What’s the argument there?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s liberating in multiple senses. Cut emissions or the planet fries — that’s incentive enough. But we also save lives. About 9 million people die each year from air pollution tied to fossil combustion. We prevent childhood asthma. We reduce the leverage of petro-authoritarians. And we unlock a wave of useful appliances: heat pumps that use a little electricity to move latent heat in the air and keep homes comfortable year-round; EVs and e-bikes that make cities quieter and cleaner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You really believe there’s hope?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I have hope that it’s worth the try. I can’t think of a better way to spend a life than working on the gravest problem our species has stumbled into.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>On page one you say there’s still a path forward. When is that path foreclosed? How much warming is too much?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, we don’t know. We’ve never run this experiment with people watching. The last five times the atmosphere filled with carbon — because of massive volcanic eruptions — there were mass extinctions. We’re adding carbon faster now than in those episodes. But unlike volcanoes, our “eruptions” are cars, factories, and power plants we could shut down quickly if we chose. It may be that we’ve already waited too long. The momentum in polar melt and the knock-on effects on jet and Gulf streams are frightening. I’m not a Pollyanna. My first book was called <em>The End of Nature</em>. But for the first time, we have a scalable response. So we should try like hell and hope the Hollywood ending works at least a little.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paint the bleak alternative plainly. If we don’t get this right, what’s the world like in 10, 50, 100 years?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If it’s not hell, it’s close in temperature. Smokier. Harder to grow food. Biology in shock. Extinctions accelerating. At 3 degrees Celsius, the UN estimates 1 to 3 billion climate refugees. That would mean up to a quarter of humanity forced to move. A couple of million people at our southern border nearly broke American politics; now multiply by a thousand. That’s why every tenth of a degree we avoid is the most important political work humans have ever undertaken.</p>
