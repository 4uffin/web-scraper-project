<p class="has-text-align-none">It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk’s death without understanding who he was in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberals had a dim view of that track record — focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to President Donald Trump’s authoritarian project (like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461408/charlie-kirk-shooting-killed-right-way-suspect">sending seven buses</a> to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I must admit that this second perspective doesn’t come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer —&nbsp;a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/">The Scholar’s Stage</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/bullets-and-ballots-the-legacy-of-charlie-kirk/">his piece</a>, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left’s turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood <em>against</em> MAGA’s most radical anti-democratic voices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance. Now, much of the right believes it’s their turn to seize control of culture, to have a version of the left’s “George Floyd moment” of 2020.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I didn’t agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk’s killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk’s passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second only to Donald Trump himself, Kirk is probably the most important individual in creating the current intellectual and organizational landscape of the MAGA movement. You wouldn&#8217;t get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who&#8217;s willing to say shocking things on the internet.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the piece, I suggest there&#8217;s [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the size of his audience. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. His TikTok channel had 7 million followers. He&#8217;s had campus debates that had upwards of 2 billion views in total all across the world. Five million Twitter followers on top of that.&nbsp;So he had this giant megaphone. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second thing that he had was TPUSA and the little organizations that were built off of it. TPUSA is a very large, 850- to 900-chapter organization. This is a mass mobilization machine. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA&#8217;s Turning Point Action Committee might&#8217;ve gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPUSA’s organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your third source of power is that he&#8217;s this connector.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donors love him. He&#8217;s famously charismatic. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. There are several congressional candidates who came from TPUSA and are in Congress right now. And because he was running this podcast where he&#8217;s talking to the existing class of staffers, the existing media magnates, the existing politicians, he&#8217;s at the center of this network of people. And this is probably one of his most important roles in the right, especially the more MAGA right. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You wrote,</strong> <strong>“There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. And this was not only true of the Trump administration, but also across Congress and state governments and in news agencies like Fox News.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a guesstimate. The number might be underestimated —&nbsp;because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration&#8217;s appointments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA —&nbsp;people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here&#8217;s somebody who might be good for this position, here&#8217;s somebody who shouldn&#8217;t be in that position.” And he wasn&#8217;t the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But this isn&#8217;t just true for little [roles]. This is true for Cabinet members. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During [2016], Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.&#8217;s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he&#8217;s had a conversion. He&#8217;s one of us now. You need to meet with him. You need to take him seriously. You need to introduce him to your dad.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s how JD Vance got in with cahoots with Trump in the first place, just because of Charlie Kirk. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There&#8217;s half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, &#8220;Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. They all say that they genuinely cared for Kirk.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk’s death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that&#8217;s correct. If you look at the MAGA movement as a whole, Kirk was a lot of people&#8217;s friend. That&#8217;s why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We&#8217;re going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This position at the center of the MAGA world network —&nbsp;in addition to these kind of institutional things that he built up, the big megaphone he had, his ability to basically leverage all of that into helping other people make connections —&nbsp;made him sort of an indispensable pillar of the movement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So when he was shot, that was really not just an attack on somebody who says very controversial things. This is a person who helped pioneer [not only] the message, but also the institutions and the organizational networks of the current version of the right. And he did it by the time he was 31. An immensely talented individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One thing that&#8217;s also struck me in the responses and the way that these figures talk about Kirk&#8217;s death is the omnipresence of the word “they.” It&#8217;s “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there&#8217;s no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what do people on the right mean by “they?”</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem&#8217;s over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who&#8217;s willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he&#8217;s just arrested until he dies —&nbsp;this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there&#8217;s larger structural problems —&nbsp;that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. If you didn&#8217;t agree with that stuff, this felt very oppressive to you, like you were being chased out of the public sphere.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take Jimmy Kimmel off the air.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would&#8217;ve been taken off the air without the state. And we don&#8217;t have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it’s pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin’s actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But in the Kirk case, what’s the equivalent&nbsp;force that created Kirk’s killer? Is it left-wing animosity toward conservatism? Is it mainstream liberal ideology? What is the thing that the violence against Kirk is supposed to be an outgrowth of? Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This “they” will differ from person to person. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a consensus. The possible options for “they” range from, at the narrowest, the kind of antifa people who are willing to use or at least endorse violence on the left. [At the broadest], it’s all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. That was cited as an example of the left&#8217;s inherent desire to kick us out of public spaces. Very similar to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/09/10/493427601/hillary-clintons-basket-of-deplorables-in-full-context-of-this-ugly-campaign">when Hillary Clinton says</a>, &#8220;[Half of] Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you&#8217;re dehumanizing us, if you&#8217;re calling us deplorable, you&#8217;re basically saying we&#8217;re outside of the pale of American politics — then you are part of the “they” who basically dehumanizes someone like Kirk enough that he should be killed. I think that&#8217;s how they would say it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I&#8217;m not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? Because to me, it seems analytically incoherent. JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk&#8217;s death. But it was one of Vance’s political enemies.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don&#8217;t think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that&#8217;s one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that&#8217;s where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, [liberal philanthropist George] Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. That&#8217;s where they&#8217;ll kind of all connect that together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Someone like you, you&#8217;ll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. All you guys excused the violence in 2020, excused antifa, excused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/chaz-seattle-autonomous-zone-police-protest">taking over CHAZ</a>, excused all this stuff because you normatively agreed with it and thought that Trump was bad enough that that this sort of violence was okay. And that&#8217;s the same attitude, that&#8217;s the same world that creates young guys who want to go and shoot one of our most prominent leaders.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that&#8217;s how they would connect those dots.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk&#8217;s role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The way I explain it in this piece —&nbsp;this is really hard for liberals to believe —&nbsp;is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people&#8217;s reactions to Kirk&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were a young person on the right —&nbsp;you believe something like transgenderism is a lie or a mental disease, which is a pretty standard belief on the right — you were afraid to say what you believed because you felt like you would be socially ostracized, people on campus would bully you, harass you, treat you differently, you would have professors who might grade you differently, you wouldn&#8217;t have good job prospects, you would be afraid of becoming a viral example.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk&#8217;s campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they&#8217;re designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. Because Kirk was a campus activist first, a media figure second.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2236161830.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0062492188476426,100,99.987501562305" alt="A young person raises their hands while singing at the crowded memorial" title="A young person raises their hands while singing at the crowded memorial" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A mourner during a memorial service for Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on September 21, 2025. | Rebecca Noble/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Rebecca Noble/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. There are more of you than it seems. You guys are all afraid to stand up and show you&#8217;re conservative. I&#8217;m going to come here, I&#8217;m going to organize a TPUSA chapter, and you&#8217;re going to see that you&#8217;re not alone. Second, I&#8217;m going to go and debate all these people around you, anyone who wants to come up. A professor, a student, anyone who wants to can come and debate me. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. We can stand up, we can be part of the public sphere.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And so there&#8217;s a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve probably met both of those sorts when you were in college. If you want to have a movement that isn&#8217;t just people like that, you have to find some way to inspire people to stand up. And that&#8217;s what Kirk was doing. He&#8217;s modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that&#8217;s who was murdered. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don&#8217;t have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>That&#8217;s where I wanted to bring us to at the end: how both sides should feel about their enemies.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I have this fear, given Kirk&#8217;s personal significance, that the right’s authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. It&#8217;s making it very, very, very difficult for people across partisan lines to view each other with anything but mistrust and suspicion.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what are we supposed to do about that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think there&#8217;s a little bit of a crossroads here. I think the right has to decide whether Kirk’s life or his death is the thing that should be remembered.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that Kirk&#8217;s life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we&#8217;d be stupid if we left it for something that we don&#8217;t know if it will work.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What I&#8217;ve been telling people on the right is, if you seriously believe you&#8217;re going to have a 2020 moment, you guys are somewhat deluding yourselves. Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously, you had a pandemic, everyone was cooped in their house and wanted to get out and be out. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. Black Lives Matter started seven years before 2020. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And in many ways, 2020 was the culmination of a decade&#8217;s worth of theorizing and activism and changing public opinion. So I don&#8217;t think this attempt to use the state to have a 2020 moment is going to work. I just don&#8217;t think the public is there: I think it&#8217;s going to backfire.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we&#8217;re being censored if we don&#8217;t see otherwise” —&nbsp;to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate the right has been having for a long time is “Do we think that the other side can live with us? How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of people, a lot of politicians, understand this and have gone out of their way not to be inflammatory on all this. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html">wrote that editorial</a>. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe it&#8217;s helpful if folks on the left don&#8217;t just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that&#8217;s the message you took away from all this, I think you&#8217;ll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. All these diagnoses and concepts were exciting, Nucci says, and helped explain so much. But as he continued his schooling, he realized that applying those terms in everyday life could be perilous.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23769973/limits-therapy-speak-narcissist-gaslighting-trauma-toxic">boundaries or narcissism</a> — or have <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24140293/anxiety-catchall-unpleasant-emotion-emotional-intelligence-mental-health">internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions</a>. “I was noticing that not only was some of it just technically incorrect, but it was being explained or applied in a way that ultimately was harmful,” Nucci says. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So Nucci, a licensed psychotherapist in private practice with over 250,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joenuccitherapy">Instagram</a>, set out to dispel some of those myths — to correct the therapy-speak that has come to dominate mental health. In <a href="https://joenuccitherapy.com/psychobabble-viral-mental-health-myths-the-truths-to-set-you-free/"><em>Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free</em></a>, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Here, he discusses seven of the most pervasive, how we got here, and how to fight back.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Your diagnosis explains who you are</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Diagnoses are best utilized to inform a treatment plan to promote better functioning, Nucci says. But when people wear their diagnoses like a label, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. “With the right medication, with the right mindset shifts, with the right coaching and executive functioning training, you can actually minimize how often you run late and to the point where you&#8217;re not running late any more than the typical person,” he says. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of relying on one term to define yourself, Nucci suggests highlighting many of your qualities using a variety of words: creative, outgoing, scatterbrained at times. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You’re a people pleaser&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn’t specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So-called people pleasing becomes problematic when it’s motivated by conflict aversion — you’re afraid of upsetting a friend so you don’t voice your opinion even when you want to. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are&nbsp;mad at him — he’s been open with friends and family about it. “People, overall, were really supportive,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Your date is a love bomber</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. Originally intended to refer to a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201703/the-danger-of-manipulative-love-bombing-in-a-relationship">manipulation tactic</a> where love and affection are used to control another person, the understanding of love bombing tends to point to any relationship that’s progressing quickly. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean they’re attempting to manipulate their romantic partner.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you’ve seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean they’re attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you’re considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You’re powerless to solve your problems&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Inspired by a metaphor he often saw online — “A flower isn&#8217;t doing well. Do you blame the flower, or do you blame the quality of the soil, the air, the sunlight?” — Nucci believes both systemic societal issues and personal autonomy play a role in mental health. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it’s important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you&#8217;re on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there&#8217;s going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. You don&#8217;t want to be so rigid in that stance that you miss the easy wins of stuff you can do and stuff that you can work on.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can’t control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “You&#8217;re not actually advancing towards the goals that you value,” Nucci says. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you&#8217;re in? Maybe that&#8217;s your family, maybe that&#8217;s your culture or country. … That can also be really, really healing.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You should learn as much about mental health as you can&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn’t equate with healing, Nucci says. In therapy, counselors typically begin by helping patients name their experiences, process them, and analyze them, he explains. “Sometimes, when people are able to articulate a cogent analysis, their symptoms go away — not always, but sometimes,” Nucci says. “At that point you want to stop analyzing, because if you continue, it quickly becomes obsessing, ruminating.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You can never have enough emotional intimacy</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. You shouldn’t feel bad if you don’t want to tell your partner what you’d tell your therapist. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The same goes for your children. Just because you’d confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn’t mean it’s necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn’t mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. “Maybe it&#8217;s your partner, maybe it&#8217;s your therapist, maybe it&#8217;s a friend.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You need therapy if you want a relationship</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won’t replace the experience of actually dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“You’ve got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that&#8217;s all any of us can do,” Nucci says. “If that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re struggling with, therapy can be a great intermediate support for you, but I think it&#8217;s inaccurate to say that it will make you completely ready.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Charlie Kirk has been turned into the first martyr of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/416042/religion-politics-trump-christian-nationalism-liberty-maga">the MAGA faith</a>. And this matters because it is martyr veneration that helped both Christianity and Islam transform from small local movements centered on charismatic preachers <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Witnesses_to_Faith/3n_P0Fztsn8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0">into global religions</a>. In launching its own martyrs, MAGA may be moving from a movement focused on one beguiling leader in the person of Donald Trump to a broader faith that could outlast him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the assassination, a variety of MAGA-foe pundits have compared the <a href="https://www.laprogressive.com/progressive-issues/charlie-kirk-echoes-horst-wessel">MAGA response to Kirk’s murder</a> — including Stephen Miller’s convenient claim that Kirk’s last message to him was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3806525/charlie-kirks-last-message-to-stephen-miller-dismantle-the-radical-left/">a call to “dismantle the radical Left”</a> — to the response to the killing of <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/11/2343074/-Is-Charlie-Kirk-MAGA-s-Horst-Wessel-Song-call-to-arms-with-poll">Horst Wessel</a>, a German Nazi murdered by two members of Communist Party of Germany in 1930. In the hands of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Wessel’s death became a rallying cry, and Wessel himself a heroic martyr whose death symbolized the Nazi struggle against Communism. Goebbels had Wessel mythologized through songs, rallies, and public ceremonies, creating a cult around him that galvanized support for the Nazi movement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The comparisons to Horst Wessel are not without merit. His death was a major boon for Nazi propaganda, just as Kirk’s death has given MAGA and the Trump administration proximate cause to escalate attacks on their political adversaries. But those comparisons miss something crucial. Goebbels himself was consciously drawing on an earlier model, and it is that model, <a href="https://uni-goettingen.de/en/martyrdom+in+late+antiquity/205597.html">the Late Antique cult of the martyrs</a>, that the MAGA faithful are now, consciously or not, also invoking.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Until now, the evangelical Christianity that Kirk embraced — and still the default mode of worship for American Christian nationalists — has had only a tenuous relationship with martyrdom. There have been powerful stories, to be sure: <a href="https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/cassie-bernalls-faith-at-gunpoint-reverberates-nationally-globally/">Cassie Bernall, the teenager at Columbine</a> who supposedly declared her faith before being shot, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/03/john-chau-christian-missionary-death-sentinelese">John Allen Chau, the young missionary</a> killed on North Sentinel Island. But these episodes are remembered as isolated moments of witness-inspiring stories of faith, rather than built into an ongoing culture of veneration as evidenced by the official support for the efforts to celebrate Kirk’s memory, including from the president of the United States. Evangelicals have often been suspicious of martyr-saints in part because this brand of martyr veneration smacks of “works” and Catholic hagiography rather than the Evangelical emphasis on personal salvation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That reluctance has been a weakness, because martyrs inspire the faithful, galvanize movements, and spread a message far more effectively than any sermon. After all, what better evidence of truth than that there were hundreds, nay thousands, prepared to die in witness to that truth? &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>As MAGA’s first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions’ martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, while it is now common to claim that Christians were relentlessly persecuted by the Roman Empire, in recent years this idea has been widely challenged. Scholars like <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-myth-of-persecution-candida-moss?variant=32206054129698">Candida Moss</a> have convincingly argued that while individual Christians were persecuted and occasionally killed for their beliefs, the idea of persistent and widespread persecution was largely an invention of Christians themselves. Researchers have argued that stories of Christian persecution were insidiously crafted not just to inspire the faithful, but also to silence and shame nonconformists and keep the churches funded.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a similar vein, the MAGA movement, ever resourceful and idiosyncratic, has seemingly turned to the medieval Christian traditions, creating a martyr who would be at home in any sixth-century book or church. And as MAGA’s first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions’ martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith, including the reshaping of the Pentecostal Kirk into a generic “Christian,” who really loved America, by the way.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to create a martyr</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On September 9, Kirk had been a member of the MAGA manosphere, a community college dropout who argued with college students. The co-founder and face of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, Kirk entered the national political scene as a teenager. At that time, he was part of what was even then a dying breed of secular American conservative, and, at least publicly, did not show much interest at all in religion, except to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/charlie-kirk-turning-point-donald-trump-christian-nationalism-rcna156565">urge his fellow conservatives to respect the separation of church and state</a>. Then, in 2021, Kirk partnered with Rob McCoy, the senior pastor of Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks, California, to found <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/pastor-rob-mccoy-charlie-kirks-190801887.html">TPUSA Faith</a>, a faith-based version of Turning Point. This was part of an increasingly religious tenor in Kirk’s public statements and views; however, on September 9, few would have thought of Kirk as primarily — or even particularly — a religious figure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, the moment he was pronounced dead that began to change: Alongside <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/09/16/dont-shut-down-free-speech-in-charlie-kirks-name/">portrayals of Kirk</a> as a defender of free speech, there was the explicitly religious veneration and storytelling. All over the MAGA internet, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/unite-kingdom-rally-drew-millions-133000346.html">and even in reactionary circles abroad</a>, people said: Kirk was an evangelist, even a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1317843273399984">modern-day John the Baptist</a>. His death will be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/opinion/charlie-kirk-memorial-christianity.html">impetus for revival</a>. Mainstream media <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/14/charlie-kirk-christian-religious-beliefs-shaped-advocacy/86116403007/">repeated the claim that Kirk wanted Christianity</a> to be his legacy. And official White House social media, too, referred to his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1867299070516318">memorial as a “revival.”</a> The hagiography of Charlie Kirk had begun.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s especially clear that Kirk is being made into a martyr for the MAGA movement because he’s being celebrated as a generic “Christian.” In the process, his real religious background is blurred or even completely ignored. Kirk’s wife, Erika, is a Roman Catholic and Kirk has had nice things to say both about Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians. But make no mistake: Charlie Kirk himself, to the extent he had developed an adult religious identity over the past five years, <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/nov/24/in-california-charlie-kirks-pastor-sees-gods-hand-in-trumps-win/">was a Pentecostal</a>, a particularly<strong> </strong>evangelical brand of Christianity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet that hasn’t stopped both the reactionary American Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan from comparing Kirk to a “<a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/nov/24/in-california-charlie-kirks-pastor-sees-gods-hand-in-trumps-win/">modern-day St. Paul</a>.” Nor, most bizarrely of all, has it prevented Metropolitan Tikhon Shevkunov, an influential bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/09/22/putins-confessor-metropolitan-tikhon-hails-charlie-kirk-as-a-martyr-a90588">known as “Putin’s Confessor,”</a> from calling Kirk’s death “martyric” and declaring that Kirk “<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/624999-top-russian-orthodox-cleric-honors/">is truly effective in missionary work</a>.” On social media and message boards, traditionalist Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOcO1-QjWt5/?hl=en">have declared with certainty</a> that Kirk would have converted to their favored church if only permitted to live a bit longer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gIyNhNP3mo">he was “interested” after all</a>, although he never gave any real indication of any pending conversion (and many <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOvbsY4Fado/">evangelical influencers have pushed back</a> against this idea). It is a blurring of lines Kirk might have approved of. He has an upcoming book advocating that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/09/15/charlie-kirks-books-and-podcasts-top-charts-following-assassination/">Christians adopt the Jewish practice</a> of keeping the Sabbath, putting him in a long line of <a href="https://ccj.org.uk/sites/ccj.hocext.co.uk/files/2023-03/CCJ%202023%20Explainer.pdf">evangelicals who co-opt Jewish practice</a> to their own ends.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflation of Kirk’s religious identity, both by him and his would-be hagiographers,&nbsp;makes most sense when placed within the larger story of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/416042/religion-politics-trump-christian-nationalism-liberty-maga">how MAGA is remaking religion itself</a>. For decades, the religious right sought to apply Christian scripture to American life; they were traditionalists, often theocrats, who wanted the law to conform to the church. But Trump’s new religious right reverses that relationship. In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump. The Religious Liberty Commission —&nbsp;packed not with the mainline Protestants that have dominated American religious life but with evangelicals, conservative Catholics, Orthodox Jews, and even Muslim converts — makes this explicit: It is not doctrine that binds them but a shared sense of cultural siege.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That is why Kirk’s memory works best for the movement if he is treated not as a Pentecostal, but as a generic “Christian” and specifically as a Christian whose Christian faith was explicitly tied to the MAGA cause. Theological specifics — once so divisive between Catholics, evangelicals, and Orthodox — matter far less than political utility. In a movement that builds theology to fit politics, Kirk can be cast as an evangelical evangelist, a Catholic saint, or even a hero for Russian Orthodoxy, because the point is not religious accuracy but political cohesion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And frankly, the generalization of Kirk’s religious identity is only possible because he was part of the MAGA faithful and came to his faith that way. Thus, it was a “MAGA Christianity.” Take, for example, Kirk’s praise of the role of the <a href="https://thecatholicherald.com/article/charlie-kirk-was-close-to-becoming-a-catholic-as-he-meditated-on-virgin-mary-as-solution-to-toxic-feminism">Virgin Mary in Catholicism</a>, which Catholics and Orthodox have cited as proof he would have eventually joined them. Kirk had not come to believe in the intercessory powers of Mary or been bowled over by the countless Marian miracles that dot the history of Christianity. No, Kirk thought the veneration of Mary was an antidote to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzUBMlqF1tA">toxic feminism</a>,” teasing in his noncommittal way it might even be enough to make him convert.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Medieval at the memorial</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oddly, those social media commentators desperate to be Kirk’s co-religionists might be on to something. On the surface, the memorial for Kirk on Sunday in Arizona has largely <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5549402/charlie-kirk-evangelical-christian-worship-martyr">been noted for its evangelical character.</a> And it is true, the event had contemporary Christian worship music and plenty of pleas for people to “read their Bibles,” subtle hints to experience the personal conversion at the heart of evangelicalism. But these aspects of evangelical worship and theology have long found their way into other parts of Christianity. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/the-catholic-charismatic-renewal">Charismatic Catholics exist</a>. And what took place at Kirk’s memorial, from the speeches to the memorabilia, was not simply evangelical enthusiasm. It echoed much older patterns, drawn straight out of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, eras that predate evangelicalism altogether.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, there is the much-discussed contrast between the speeches given by Erika Kirk and Donald Trump. As many progressive commentators have pointed out, Erika Kirk said she forgave her husband’s killer. She was followed by the president, who immediately called for revenge. Both drew applause from the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This may simply reflect an audience willing to cheer anything, but it also echoes the world of the medieval saint. In that world, the virtuous woman, often a virgin or widow, pleads for mercy and forgiveness for the saint’s persecutors, while the strong Christian king seeks vengeance. The idea was central to <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/queens-gold-and-intercession-the-case-of-eleanor-of-aquitaine/">medieval notions of queenship</a>. It is a model that allows the language of Christian mercy to coexist with the harsh realities of authoritarian rule, which is exactly what MAGA is aiming for. It was also a model that allowed for women to have a significant public role while not transgressing normative ideas of femininity. Say, for example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/erika-kirk-turning-point-ceo">Erika Kirk becoming the CEO of Turning Point USA</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, there’s the merch: hats, T-shirts, and cups sold bearing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/turning-point-usa-expands-its-merchandise-collection-items-commemorating-charlie-kirk">images of Kirk with a halo above his head</a> or walking hand in hand with Christ in paradise; these would find more home in medieval Catholicism than among idol-fearing Evangelicals. These are all part of medieval Christianity, a pre-evangelical way of making and celebrating a martyr. It is a way of celebrating the saints that the evangelicals of the MAGA faith have seemingly embraced, a part of Catholicism they have embraced despite the theological contradictions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The earliest Christians celebrated the Eucharist over the tombs of martyrs. To this day, the relics of saints are buried in the altars of Orthodox and Catholic churches. That is how central the cult of the martyrs was to the early Christian churches&#8217; self-understanding, even if most of the stories were simply made up. Today, the religious movement that is being built in America at this moment is as dangerous and unprecedented as its new politics. And, just like Christianity two millennia ago, this new MAGA faith is going to need martyrs for all the reasons Christianity did: to inspire the faithful, punish dissenters, and keep the money flowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Martyrs made Christianity more than a small sect that would soon die out like so many before and after it; they made it a religion, offering the movement the political tools to grow and consolidate. The MAGA movement has, consciously or not, learned from this history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these hosts, who appeal to a young, male, and politically disengaged audience, now seem less excited about the administration’s actions and focus. While some remain loyal, others are more critical or have shifted away from politics entirely. This fragmentation could pose a challenge for Trump, the MAGA movement, and the Republican Party in future elections as they try to hold together the unconventional coalition of voters that helped him win reelection.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-top-50-podcasts-in-the-u-s-for-q1-2025-from-edison-podcast-metrics/">tens of millions of listeners</a>, these podcasts have a <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2025/">significant reach</a>. They frequently top podcast charts and attract a large audience, particularly among men. Recent data shows that the share of podcast listeners who <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-evolving-demographics-of-podcast-listeners/">identify as Republican has been growing</a>, and millions more Americans have become regular podcast consumers, making these hosts’ shifts in loyalty and tone all the more important.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump’s loyal broadcasters</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2.2 million subscribers (8.4 million on their</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nelkfilmz"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> prank channel); pranks, pop culture, and sports; weekly</em></p>

The Nelk group began their media and entertainment business as party-boy influencers, known <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/canadian-pranksters-nelk-have-millions-of-young-followers-their-dangerous-decision-to-party-during-the/article_5b904c5e-e3c4-5ab0-ade4-54e6cb5a403a.html">as early as 2020</a> as “the most recognizable personalities for young people in North America,” when they gained notoriety for hosting parties during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And they built on that brand of performative hypermasculinity, organizing “brotests” to reopen gyms, traveling across the US and essentially taking contrarianism as far as they could. One fan <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/canadian-pranksters-nelk-have-millions-of-young-followers-their-dangerous-decision-to-party-during-the/article_5b904c5e-e3c4-5ab0-ade4-54e6cb5a403a.html">told the Toronto Star</a> back in 2020 that “a large part of ‘Nelk’ is not listening” and not following rules.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That spirit brought them millions of followers, views, and financial success through partnerships, promotions, and subscriptions. And through their vlogging and prank videos, they have been able to mainstream and promote a variety of right-leaning and far-right commentators on their show, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/manosphere/how-nelk-boys-went-viral-pranksters-right-wing-media-stars">leading to accusations</a> of “extreme misogyny” and bigotry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last few years, Forgeard and his collaborators have <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/youtube-donald-trump-nelk-boys-full-send-podcast-interview-1320041/">interviewed</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6So8DTFq0RFf67hTGsY2cu"> Trump</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2AzudK4Bars1p1mCGDs4RF"> repeatedly</a> and talked with him and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-re1pBdMD8I">JD Vance</a> during the 2024 campaign. Trump, in turn, has shouted the boys out in speeches and praised them and their work, noting in 2023 that many in the political and media establishment “don’t realize that the NELK boys are probably a lot more powerful than them.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since January, they’ve been more or less supportive of Trump — praising his foreign policy and negotiating over the Russia-Ukraine war. Still, more recently, they have said that they want “to maybe stay out of politics for a little bit because we just want to have fun, too,” after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/24/netanyahu-nelk-boys-podcast?utm_source=chatgpt.com">getting intense criticism</a> for interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">PBD Podcast</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2.69 million subscribers; current events and business; two to three times each week</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hosted by businessman Patrick Bet-David in a panel-style discussion with three to four co-hosts, <em>PBD Podcast</em> tends to talk about all kinds of current events, ranging from celebrity news to hard politics. Trump has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dmwG54QsKc">appeared</a> on the show before, visiting Bet-David during the 2024 campaign, and Bet-David has called himself a staunch Trump ally.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the shows feature some debate over Trump’s policies, those conversations tend to end by criticizing Democrats and boosting the Trump stance. During the rollout of “Liberation Day” tariffs in spring, for example, the panel was torn and confused about the impact of tariffs on the global markets, before criticizing the Federal Reserve and endorsing Trump’s negotiations. Similarly, they have long praised Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, calling Trump an “alpha” male for his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. And they show no signs of slowing their support soon.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The jaded or disappointed critics</h2>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The Joe Rogan Experience</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>20 million subscribers; interviews, commentary; about four times per week</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2194402282.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.031867431485026,100,99.93626513703" alt="Joe Rogan during the inauguration" title="Joe Rogan during the inauguration" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Media personality Joe Rogan, center left, during the 60th presidential inauguration in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt; | Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest podcaster in the world <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/438944/joe-rogan-experience-podcast-america-mirror-2020s-politics-truth-young-men">wasn’t always</a> a Trump fan, but became one over the course of the last five years as his show became one of the most influential platforms for politicians, celebrities, thinkers, and more. Rogan’s October <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnY">Trump interview</a> broke <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-social-media-surge-trump-interview-1975885">records</a> (it’s been viewed 60 million times now) and kicked off a frenzy on the Democratic side when he didn’t agree to the terms set by Kamala Harris’s campaign to get her on the show.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last few months, however, Rogan’s support for Trump has been much more muted. He’s been critical of tariffs, government <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-rogan-trump-palestine-student-protest_n_68893085e4b07dfa117e4b72">censorship</a> and pseudo-policing language, the extent to which <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rogan-says-voters-frustrated-because-expected-trumps-ice-raids-nab-gang-members-not-landscapers">mass deportations</a> are being carried out, and, more recently, the obfuscation over the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-rogan-slams-trump-claim-epstein-scandal-hoax_n_68a5e505e4b0d31656202e09">supposed Epstein Files</a> and the administration “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xCsQGI9p1M">gaslighting</a>” supporters. The podcaster sounds more jaded. As opposed to becoming a full-throated critic, he seems less enthusiastic about the president’s embrace of big tech CEOs, the lack of promised transparency by the administration on things like government spending, censorship, and the Epstein case. Instead, Rogan demonstrates disillusionment and disengagement.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">This Past Weekend With Theo Von</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>4.1 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; about twice a week</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2199791458.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Theo Von" title="Theo Von" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Theo Von attends “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert” at Radio City Music Hall on February 14, 2025, in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; | Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Theo Von, the comedian and host of <em>This Past Weekend</em>, has started to split with Trump more visibly over the Epstein episode. Von used to be a bigger Trump fan; he hosted Trump a year ago, when in the span of a week he talked to both Trump and Bernie Sanders, and this May, he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-theo-von-qatar-military-jokes-6cb21a321a1ed806577b84dfbf9ea9ab">delivered a stand-up set</a> during Trump’s visit to a Qatari American military base.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, Von seems to be a lot more skeptical of Trump this summer — criticizing his tariffs, America’s involvement in the Middle East by attacking Iran, American support for Israel and “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMvtbldNuUk/">helping</a>” support a “genocide in Gaza,” and the administration’s response to calls for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0oMuwGYgDM">transparency</a> on the Epstein case.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Von himself has started to host Trump critics, having on Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw">discuss</a> the Epstein case, and using social media to <a href="https://x.com/TheoVon/status/1945590466441081144?lang=en">criticize Vance</a> (a former guest of Von’s) for reneging on his promise to “release” the Epstein files. In more recent episodes of his show, Von sounds more muted about Trump — still hosting conversations with a variety of guests and telling jokes but also talking about how “corrupt” the “system” is, how nothing really seems to be changing, and how depressing politics is.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Andrew Schulz’s Flagrant With Akaash Singh</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; weekly</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2217766222.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Andrew Schulz" title="Andrew Schulz" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Andrew Schulz speaks onstage at a Netlfix comedy night at the Comedy Store on May 29, 2025, in West Hollywood, California.&lt;/p&gt; | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The host of the <em>Flagrant</em> comedy podcast, Andrew Schulz, is disillusioned with Trump, but much more vocally. Schulz was a big Trump supporter in the past, also hosting him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c">his show</a> in 2024. Schulz has now<strong> </strong>turned into Trump’s loudest former-fan-turned-critic in this universe. The sharp break came in July, during the Epstein debacle, when he began to express more regret for his Trump support, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/did-trump-betray-his-voters-feat-pod-save-america-ro-khanna/id1288641267?i=1000717378615">saying that</a>, “If I wanted to vote for somebody that was going to keep the Epstein files under wrap, that was going to extend the foreign wars and was going to increase the budget, I would have voted for Kamala.” And he is communicating a lot of what new 2024 Trump voters who weren’t huge supporters of the president have been saying in polling. “Everything he campaigned on I believe he wanted to do, and now he’s doing the exact opposite thing of every single fucking thing,” Schulz <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-trump-is-covering-for-epstein-how-diddy-got-off/id1288641267?i=1000716694325">said in July</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Schulz, like Von, has started to host more liberal and Trump-critical voices: Sanders, Khanna, Pete Buttigieg, the <em>Pod Save America</em> hosts, and the journalist Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder). He now teases himself for his past support for Trump and has essentially turned his show into a vehicle for those expressing regret over their Trump support to feel better about looking for other options.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As Schulz said recently, Democrats have an opportunity to win back voters like him. “You have an opportunity to be like, hey, we told you he was a liar. Here’s the proof that he’s a liar. Come over here, here are some ideas that might be better. You might like these. If you just go, hey, fuck you, you’re dumb, the people that are called dumb are never going to come to your side.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The apathetic or neutral voices</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A handful of podcasters and influencers have pulled back from discussing current events and politics, or if they delve into Trump-related topics, they do so carefully. Shawn Ryan (4.8 million subscribers) and Lex<strong> </strong>Fridman<strong> </strong>(4.79 million subscribers), for example, host interview shows that delve into hyper-specific and niche topics with guests who don’t talk too much about political news of the day, but they both conducted softball interviews with Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G80iLTctFuY">last</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCbfTN-caFI"> autumn</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Both have continued speaking with businessmen, authors, former military officers, historians, and thinkers since the election but have not been vocal defenders or commentators on Trump’s presidency so far. Fridman interviewed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but they only talked about Trump in passing for a few moments, and it was never critical. The same situation applies to Ryan, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrgmwtpAsWc">also interviewed Vance</a> last year, but hasn’t talked much about the Epstein debacle, tariffs, or immigration.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Two other big Trump supporters have pulled back from political discussions and promoting Trump. Adin Ross (4.6 million) and Logan Paul (4.8 million) both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s11uIW7wi-E">interviewed</a> Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrFdHO7FH8w">last year</a> but pivoted back to their original style of video livestreaming pranks, commentary on internet culture, and challenges (like Ross having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSbjUskLBA8">his back waxed</a> on a livestream with MrBeast).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The shifting loyalties within the manosphere could be a sign of broader changes among the young, male voters who helped elect Trump —&nbsp;the current tensions at least suggest early challenges to the durability of the president&#8217;s coalition. Still, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will actively work to win back the support of these creators and their audiences&nbsp;—&nbsp;he hasn’t returned to most of these shows since taking office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our great national censorship nightmare is over — but only for about three-quarters of the ABC stations in America.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air Tuesday night after Disney, the parent company of ABC, reversed its decision last week to suspend his talk show over comments he made about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462173/charlie-kirk-killer-motive-tyler-robinson-jimmy-kimmel">MAGA supporters’ response to</a> the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. That initial pause came after increasing pressure from the Trump administration and <a href="https://wtop.com/tv/2025/09/who-are-nexstar-and-sinclair-the-abc-affiliate-owners-who-issued-statements-against-jimmy-kimmel/">two TV station groups</a> — Nexstar and the conservative-leaning Sinclair — which said last week they would not air Kimmel’s show.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not you like Kimmel, his show’s return Tuesday night was a triumph for a few reasons. First, it was a victory for free speech: the return of a show that was taken off the airwaves in part because of oblique threats from the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission’s leadership, and the rebuffing of what my colleague Zack Beauchamp has called a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">climate of fear and censorship</a>” in the wake of Kirk’s death, championed by conservative activists.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, it was also a new kind of (partial) victory for liberals and their resistance efforts in the second Trump term.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Led by celebrities, podcasters, influencers, and the grassroots — as opposed to any institutions, corporations, billionaires, or political parties —&nbsp;it managed to get a major corporation to resist Trump and restore Kimmel, even though his show is only returning to about three-quarters of the ABC-affiliated TV stations in America.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While a variety of voices pushed back against this attempt at corporate censorship, Nexstar and Sinclair continued to boycott Kimmel’s show last night — airing local news segments instead of <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> in the nearly 25 percent of local ABC affiliates across the country that they own. They don’t show signs of reversing course yet. And it’s not clear what mechanism — if any — Kimmel supporters have to influence either corporation to change its policy for now.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kimmel goes “full resistance”</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday night’s monologue might end up being the moment Kimmel revived this new type of resistance — or it might get lost in another wave of Trump-induced news and scandal. It will surely be one of his best-rated shows. He came out swinging against Trump, his efforts to punish his critics, and the FCC’s chief, Brendan Carr. Kimmel didn’t directly apologize — and instead made an impassioned case for further Trump resistance, called in surprise guest (and Trump archenemy) Robert De Niro, and joked about Trump’s physical appearance and the likelihood of an Epstein Files drop “to distract us from this now. … He tried his best to cancel me, instead he forced millions of people to watch the show. That backfired bigly.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">His case against Trump was simple. “The president of the United States made it very clear he wants to see me and the hundreds of people who work here fired from our jobs. Our leader celebrates Americans losing their livelihoods because he can’t take a joke,” he said, holding back tears throughout the address. “A government threat to silence a comedian the president doesn’t like is anti-American. There is some solidarity on that from the right and the left and those in the middle. Maybe the silver lining from this is we found one thing we can agree on, and maybe we&#8217;ll even find another one.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No less potently, Kimmel didn’t identify as a liberal or a Democrat when attacking Trump, but as an American. Kimmel, who joked that he barely paid attention in school, said he never expected to be in his current position — fighting a war of principle against a would-be American despot — but that he was taught by comedians such as Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, and Howard Stern that censoring comedians is “un-American.” This was not a progressive or a liberal’s cry of rage; Kimmel attacked Trump from the absolute dead-center. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The angry affiliates problem</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Kimmel came out strong in his return, there are still other obstacles to reclaiming his former audience. Sinclair and Nexstar are continuing their boycott of his show, setting up a potential showdown with Disney and ABC in the coming days. Sinclair’s position seems ideological — demanding Kimmel apologize to Kirk’s family and make a “meaningful” contribution to Kirk’s activist group Turning Point USA. Nexstar argues that Kimmel’s speech was harmful — though the company has a deal merging with Tegna, another major station owner, pending before Trump’s FCC. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Combined, their stations reach nearly a quarter of the American viewing public —&nbsp;meaning millions of Americans (in cities like Washington, DC, Nashville, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and St Louis) who <em>might</em> want to watch Kimmel’s show simply can’t turn on their televisions and do so (I, for one, had to watch his monologue on a clandestine TikTok livestream from my phone).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel noted much of this during his monologue — citing pressure on affiliates in cities to not air his show and the slippery slope it might create in the future: “Should the government be able to regulate which podcasts the cellphone companies and wifi providers are allowed to let you download to make sure they serve the public interest?” His studio audience responded with a resounding, “No!” Kimmel and the decision-makers at the Mickey Mouse company might be hoping the rest of the country will keep feeling this way — but who knows if this fracas will be remembered beyond being just one more Trump scandal. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As the first few months of the second Trump term have shown, other major companies, law firms, universities, and organizations have acquiesced in the face of confrontation with the president. And massive street protests have been absent. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s part of what makes this moment of individual-led backlash seem so noteworthy — and one reason why it’s not clear that it can be replicated. Kimmel raised this specter Tuesday night too, noting Trump’s apparent desire to go after late-night comics specifically will probably continue.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Somehow, [he was able to] squeeze Colbert out of CBS, then he turned his sights on me, and now he’s openly rooting for NBC to fire Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers and the hundreds of Americans who work for their shows,” he said. “And I hope that if that happens, or if there&#8217;s even any hint of that happening, you will be 10 times as loud as you were this week. We have to speak out against this. He is not stopping. And it’s not just comedy. He’s gunning for our journalists too.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Celebrities, influencers, and everyday people forced Disney’s hand</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the week or so that Kimmel was off the air, the strongest efforts to push back against Trump and conservative efforts to censor Kimmel did not come from corporations, the stock market, or a major political institution. Instead, it was primarily driven by “talent” — actors, comedians, podcasters, and other individuals with a built-in audience and a public platform.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It came from the hundreds of Hollywood movie stars, comedians, and other celebrities who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5550202/jimmy-kimmel-aclu-letter">signed open letters</a>: one from the ACLU with more than 400 A-list signers, including De Niro, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, and Lin-Manuel Miranda; and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2025/09/22/jimmy-kimmel-open-letter-talk-show-suspension/86296790007/">another</a> of more than 600 comedians, including Rosie O’Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and Chelsea Handler.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was musicians like <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/sarah-mclachlan-opts-out-performing-abc-news-lilith-fair-1236552063/">Sarah McLachlan, Jewel</a>, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/olivia-rodrigo-speaks-out-on-blatant-censorship-of-jimmy-kimmels-suspension-3894366">Olivia Rodrigo</a> who backed out of promotional events and appearances for Disney-backed projects, and at least one TV writer who said they <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/damon-lindelof-supports-jimmy-kimmel-boycotts-disney-1236548613/">wouldn’t work</a> with Disney in protest.

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it was other current or former late-night and TV show hosts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GXNJ3V9lzg">Jon Stewart</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1N3vT_qb_8">Stephen Colbert</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohPToBog_-g">John Oliver</a>, <a href="https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/jimmy-fallon-reacts-to-jimmy-kimmels-suspension-wtf">Jimmy Fallon</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/09/david-letterman-jimmy-kimmel-atlantic-festival/684254/">David Letterman</a>, and <a href="https://people.com/seth-meyers-reacts-to-return-of-jimmy-kimmel-live-11814951">Seth Meyers</a> that dedicated their monologues, segments of their shows, or in-person appearances over the last week to pillory Trump and the FCC, and to support Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was “a blatant assault on freedom of speech,” Colbert, whose own show is being scrapped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/18/jimmy-kimmel-stephen-colbert-cancelled-free-speech">under dubious circumstances</a>, warned in his monologue last week. “We all see where this is going. … You can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian — a criminal — administration in the Oval Office,” Letterman warned at a festival appearance last week. “It <em>is</em> possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship,” Meyers said to his own audience on Monday night.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even some of the podcasters and new media stars that often sympathize with MAGA voiced concerns over the last week. “Manosphere” influencers like the comedians Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh spent time <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/andrew-schulzs-flagrant-with-akaash-singh/id1288641267?i=1000727387035">on their show</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO00tOukkT3/?igsh=NjZnNWhkeW16ZWd1">on social media</a> explaining why conservatives should be outraged. Meanwhile, media personalities at the sports and pop culture brand Barstool Sports <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOuNhUujH6m/">debated</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/18/sports/dave-portnoy-doubles-down-on-unique-jimmy-kimmel-take/">each</a> <a href="https://x.com/kirkminshow/status/1968682787176685954">other</a> on whether the suspension was<em>,</em> in fact, government censorship.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And though it took him some time to record an episode and he didn’t call out Trump by name, Joe Rogan, probably the most vocal “free speech” defender of the podcasting world, ultimately <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084272?i=1000728088453">criticized the FCC</a>, too, and warned those cheering Kimmel’s silencing that the same powers could be used on them in the future on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Individually, each of these statements, posts, and actions reached very different segments of the American public; in today’s siloed media and information ecosystem, perhaps none of them share an audience. But combined, they helped to spur on a tidal wave of pressure and criticism on Disney, its leadership, and its bottom line. Many of <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/celebrities-disney-boycott-kimmel-1236548919/">these</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-boycott-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk.html">same celebrities</a> helped to encourage <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/time-stand-now-disney-adults-140000185.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGAnjk5MAYTYSJl60f5HYf6mN3R0PLr1wA0pU_1PmSW2Z1702_4QJntvwrnex0MGoyuZFXLECOxqnNIwq2bIT6EZXZ0I3egIcri5zFXRoUOGqNuG8gEz_VF5Kox7fhaDK-cMXO9AKdRQ_YKjyiMGn0vaYvzDli4fu5SOyVhIppid">grassroots</a> cancellations and boycotts of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions, as well as its <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/tv/articles/thank-disney-adults-172655366.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGAnjk5MAYTYSJl60f5HYf6mN3R0PLr1wA0pU_1PmSW2Z1702_4QJntvwrnex0MGoyuZFXLECOxqnNIwq2bIT6EZXZ0I3egIcri5zFXRoUOGqNuG8gEz_VF5Kox7fhaDK-cMXO9AKdRQ_YKjyiMGn0vaYvzDli4fu5SOyVhIppid">theme parks</a> — which seem to have actually caused <a href="https://x.com/brooksbarnesNYT/status/1970491996214358254">some economic damage</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimmel referenced almost all of this during his opening monologue last night: He thanked his fellow comedians; he joked about the mass subscription cancellations; he thanked those “people who don’t support my show and what I believe, but support my right to share those beliefs anyway,” including Rogan, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other conservative media voices. And he set himself up to be, if only for one night, Hollywood’s Resistance leader. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The saga continues</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, Trump weighed in before Kimmel even started speaking with another threat: “I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative,” he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115256938634035559">posted on Truth Social</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the meantime, Disney will continue to allow streaming subscribers to watch Kimmel on Hulu (whose price is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/disney-plus-hulu-espn-streaming-price-hikes-kimmel-2025.html">about to get higher</a>), even if Nexstar and Sinclair-run local affiliates maintain their refusal to play his show on their stations. And while ABC and Disney’s brass may feel they deserve some credit for Kimmel’s reinstatement — Kimmel thanked them for bringing him back and supporting his show over the years, though “unfortunately, and I think unjustly, this puts them at risk” — the extent of their willingness to fight Trump and a weaponized FCC remain open questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One day, Mars might become a home to humans. But first, there’s the cinematic, sci-fi challenge of making the Red Planet suitable for life. There’s a problem, though: The typical person can’t get to space safely. That throws a wrench into the whole “let’s move to Mars” plan in the face of extreme climate change and other existential risks on Earth.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, the path to becoming an astronaut is “littered with the hopes and dreams of medically disqualified candidates,” said Shawna Pandya, a research astronaut with the <a href="https://astronauticsinstitute.org">International Institute for Astronautical Sciences</a> (IIAS) and the director of its Space Medicine Group. “Once upon a time, kids being diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the doctor’s office would be told, ‘Well, you could still be anything, except an astronaut.’”&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Have space aspirations?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some of the common <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ochmo-std-100-1a-rev-a-signed.pdf?emrc=9334bc">reasons</a> why you might be medically disqualified from becoming an astronaut:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tobacco use</li>
<li>Autoimmune disorders</li>
<li>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sleep apnea</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Migraines</li>
<li>Anxiety and depression</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Astronauts inherently aren’t representative of the broader population —&nbsp;they’re selected for being in very good health. The stress of existing in essentially weightless <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/what-is-microgravity/#:~:text=But%20they're%20not%20falling,%C3%9710%2D6%20g.)&amp;text=The%20condition%20of%20microgravity%20comes,object%20is%20in%20free%20fall.">microgravity</a> conditions, like those on the International Space Station (ISS), can be incredibly tough on the human body. Astronauts <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/bone-and-mineral-evaluation-and-analysis/">face heightened risks</a> of early-onset osteoporosis, insulin resistance, and significant muscle mass loss. Naturally, government space agencies want people whose bodies are more resilient to such pressures, and who can perform necessary duties without a ton of medical intervention.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Haig Aintablian, director of the <a href="https://emergencymedicine.ucla.edu/education/fellowships/space-medicine">UCLA Space Medicine Program</a>, “just as pregnancy causes the body to undergo complex and unique changes, spaceflight also produces distinct and significant physiological changes.” It also requires its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/space-medicine-new-frontier-aspiring-physicians">own medical specialty to manage</a>&nbsp;(aptly called space medicine).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot scientists don’t know, from the physical to the psychological. That&#8217;s a problem — for the future of science, space travel, and maybe even human existence at large.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/humans-to-mars/#preparing">wants</a> to go to Mars for research, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/humans-to-mars/">aims</a> to send humans there as early as the 2030s. As the most similar planet to Earth in our solar system, Mars may have once <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/mars/could-life-exist-below-mars-ice-nasa-study-proposes-possibilities/">harbored</a> life, or may even currently. And in the future, we may even need it to support us.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Decades ago, seriously engaging with the idea of moving to Mars was extremely fringe for a multitude of reasons, ranging from a lack of technical feasibility to the desire to put scientific resources toward solving problems on Earth. Elon Musk — founder of the spaceflight company SpaceX — became a famed advocate for colonizing Mars in the early 2000s. He still is. Musk, who is currently <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/if-elon-musks-net-worth-was-evenly-distributed-across-america-how-much-money-would-each">worth</a> around $410 billion, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/9/27/13081488/elon-musk-spacex-mars-colony-space-travel-funding-rocket-nasa">claims</a> that he is only accumulating assets for the purpose of Martian space settlement. Last year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/technology/elon-musk-spacex-mars.html">he said</a> that he wants 1 million human settlers on the Red Planet in a self-sustaining city by 2050.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now Musk isn’t alone. NASA experts, biologists, academics, futurists, disaster resilience researchers, and physicians are seriously <a href="https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/departments/will-humans-ever-permanently-settle-on-mars/">considering</a> the possibility of making humanity an interplanetary species.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The biggest problem for humanity to solve is the guaranteed survival of our species — which the logical answer is to become multiplanetary,” Aintablian said. “I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a better solution than Mars.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While we know some of the health effects of being on the ISS, we can’t really replicate the effects of Martian radiation exposure. Kelly Weinersmith — a biologist and co-author of <em>A City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through</em>? — thinks that settling Mars on Musk’s timescale will be catastrophic. She argues that we shouldn’t rush to set up shop before understanding — and mitigating — the risks, even if this takes centuries rather than decades.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But many advocates for settling Mars are much more impatient. The only way to get there safely would be to unlock significant advances in space medicine, a nascent field that has just barely scratched the surface in its approximately 75-year history.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nothing that humanity has done that has been worthwhile has been easy,” Aintablian told me. “So much in our development as a civilization has been difficult, and the reason why we&#8217;re able to live such comfortable lives now is because of the extremely difficult challenges that humans have had to solve in the past.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know — and don’t — about human health on Mars&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since extremely few people end up in space right now, the researchers trying to understand how to improve human health there have a limited sample size to work with. Yuri Gagarin <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/resource/yuri-gagarin-first-human-in-space/">became</a> the first human in space in 1961, and more than 600 astronauts have <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/local/jupiter/2025/03/13/women-in-space-a-timeline-of-their-journeys-to-the-stars-and-back/80712696007/">followed</a> him. Only about a sixth of them are women.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">NASA researchers have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/the-human-body-in-space/#:~:text=The%20simple%20answer%20is:%20No,%2C%20and%20Hostile/Closed%20Environments.">identified</a> some key ways that time in space can impact human health — radiation exposures, isolation, distance from Earth, altered gravity, and environmental consequences like an altered immune system. But we&#8217;re still lacking many specific examples of how these different dynamics play out in real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-1136290464.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10,0,80,100" alt="Scott and Mark Kelly in their NASA jackets with arms crossed" title="Scott and Mark Kelly in their NASA jackets with arms crossed" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Former astronaut Scott Kelly, right, who commanded a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station, along with his twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the best studies we have is NASA’s famous 2019 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aau8650">twins study</a>. Twin studies allow researchers to separate the effects of genetic predispositions from environmental influences on health outcomes. NASA compared the health of identical twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly over the course of a year. Scott went into orbit on the ISS while Mark remained on Earth. Both underwent the same battery of physiological tests, and the results indicated some surprising new differences between the two men.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Scott’s <a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Telomere">telomeres</a> — the bits of DNA at the end of our chromosomes&nbsp;— lengthened while he was in space and (mostly) reverted to normal once he returned to Earth, possibly <a href="https://cvmbs.source.colostate.edu/research-provides-new-insights-on-nasa-twins-study-and-health-effects-of-long-duration-space-flight/">indicating</a> radiation-induced DNA damage and potential increased cancer risk. Scott also lost body mass, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasas-twins-study-results-published-in-science-journal/">developed</a> signs of cardiovascular damage that were not present in Mark, and experienced some short-term cognitive changes after returning to Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While survivable with the right training, equipment, and precautions, the twin study demonstrated how space’s unique environment can have significant consequences for gene expression and overall health while in orbit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the best of the best struggle, what about the rest of us? We’re getting some insights here now, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since space tourism has literally taken off, astronauts aren’t the only ones going to space now: Wealthy non-astronauts, like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/20/1018279093/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-flight#:~:text=Liftoff!,Back%20In%20Under%2015%20Minutes&amp;text=Raedle/Getty%20Images-,Blue%20Origin's%20New%20Shepard%20rocket%20lifts%20off%20from%20the%20launch,morning%20in%20Van%20Horn%2C%20Texas.&amp;text=Wearing%20a%20cowboy%20hat%20under,Origin's%20New%20Shepard%20launch%20vehicle.">Jeff Bezos</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gayle-king-describes-blue-origin-space-launch/#:~:text=%22CBS%20Mornings%22%20co%2Dhost,This%20was%20not%20a%20ride.">Gayle King</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8e5gq8ljo">Katy Perry</a>, have recently taken short, recreational jaunts into outer space through Bezos’s space tech company, Blue Origin.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aintablian is very excited about the prospect of civilian access to space increasing, which will inherently mean people with medical issues are also flying. This represents a huge opportunity for scientists to study the medical management of a much wider range of conditions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, 10 or 15 minutes in space is hardly comparable to the conditions on the ISS. And Mars poses even worse consequences in terms of hostile environments and time spent away from Earth. Mars has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/science/mars-toxic-dust-scli-intl">toxic dust</a>, lacks plant life and a breathable atmosphere, and only has about 40 percent of Earth’s gravity. Earth’s global magnetic field <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/earths-magnetosphere">protects</a> our planet from harmful radiation, and the Martian counterparts are localized, not planet-wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The longest time someone has been in space consecutively is 438 days aboard a space station.<strong> </strong>But crewed missions to Mars would probably take at least <a href="https://www.space.com/24701-how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-mars.html">nine months</a> just to get there, let alone stay or travel back (which could take up to three years). Mars is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/hrp/hazard-distance-from-earth/">usually</a> around 140 million miles from Earth based on its orbital path around the sun, with up to a 20-minute communication delay one way. If they experienced a medical emergency, astronauts likely wouldn’t be able to access telemedicine instructions in time, and they couldn’t turn back around for treatment.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A crewed mission to Mars would have to take all of their supplies with them before they left our planet. And when the first people heading to Mars set foot on the planet, they won’t have access to the intense support astronauts receive when landing back on Earth.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting to Mars is only part of the challenge. We’ve been to space, but so far, humans have only ever sent robots to the Red Planet. We are making educated guesses at what Mars is like for living things. Earth analogues aren’t able to truly replicate the closed, hostile conditions of the space environment, which can wreak havoc on astronauts’ mental health. Desert research stations have an atmosphere, while the moon <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/moon/lunar-atmosphere/">barely</a> has one — and setting up that modest base was a huge mission in its own right. Weinersmith told me that scientists at polar research stations are isolated in remote, inhospitable environments, but they can “still open the door, take a deep breath, and not die.”&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Medicine’s new frontier</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re still pretty far from being able to breathe in Mars’ atmosphere — but it <em>would</em> be nice to get there one day and simply not die.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Enter: space medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Programs dedicated to figuring out how to get humans safely into space for long periods of time are popping up, and non-physician health care providers are getting in on the action too. UCLA is planning to launch a space nursing program and possibly space paramedic training. <a href="https://space-med.eu/#:~:text=SPACEMED%20is%20a%202%2Dyear,particularly%20space%20flight%2C%20on%20humans.">SpaceMed</a> is a European master’s program focused on human health in spaceflight and other extreme conditions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, astronauts receive most of their care from Earth-based aerospace medicine physicians called flight surgeons through telemedicine. Aintablian envisions a future where health care providers directly accompany astronauts on their expedition-class missions, like to the moon or Mars.<strong> </strong>Artificial intelligence can act as a resource for the on-board flight surgeon, he predicted, and aid in the development of other technologies that will bring us closer to Mars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such technology is already in the works. Google recently <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-sector/how-google-and-nasa-are-testing-ai-for-medical-care-in-space?utm_source=www.therundown.ai&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=openai-s-gpt-5-crisis-mode&amp;_bhlid=a3259e79928d770b69b372e2c39c344b0ee5c95c">collaborated</a> with NASA to develop an AI system that could guide astronauts in diagnosing and treating medical conditions that arise in-flight when they lack access to telemedicine.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the devil is in the details, Pandya told me. AI can help with just-in-time training for medical emergencies and diagnostics, but the data requirements would be massive. Since extremely few people end up in space — and the ones who do are overwhelmingly male — models might be trained on an unrepresentative dataset that could lead to inaccurate predictions of physiological changes in space. These kinks need to be worked out first.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, there’s a gendered gap in the research — so much so that Weinersmith told me there’s never a line to the women’s restroom at space settlement conferences. Human reproduction and development in space, as a result, is wildly understudied.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as we know, no human being has ever been to space while pregnant, and we don’t know of any humans who have been conceived in space. We’re going to learn a lot about reproduction on Earth from the first human space pregnancy and space birth, a prerequisite for a self-sustaining settlement on Mars. (Plus, space tourism companies are <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/space-hotels-future-of-travel">talking</a> <a href="https://orbitaltoday.com/2025/06/07/worlds-first-space-hotel-to-open-in-2027/">about</a> hotels in space, and we know what people do in hotels.) Ideally, you want to have an idea of what will happen to someone giving birth in space before they actually go through it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we&#8217;re arguing is that we should do the research to understand those risks before we go out there because if there are massive risks, there usually are technological solutions for some of these,” Weinersmith said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">NASA will <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-opens-simulated-mars-habitat-to-media-ahead-of-second-mission/">begin</a> its second Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog this October, a year-long “mission” to Mars in a 3D-printed habitat at Johnson Space Center in Houston, where it will collect behavioral health data on the effects of isolation and confinement. Scientists are conducting <a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/projects-and-missions/bed-rest-studies">bed rest studies</a>, which simulate the physiological effects of altered gravity and weightlessness. And as funding cuts transform the future of scientific research on Earth and beyond, space medicine researchers are among those <a href="https://spacenews.com/this-is-not-the-time-to-cut-space-enabled-medical-research/#:~:text=Research%20that%20leverages%20space%20to,they%20ought%20to%20be%20reversed.">advocating</a> for continued investment in space and biomedical science.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maedeh Mozneb, a biomedical engineer and project scientist in the Sharma Lab at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told me that the ultimate goal is to send “avatars” of astronauts to space by taking their stem cells and creating 3D tissue cultures called organoids that represent different parts of their body — yes, miniature hearts, kidneys, and even brains made from Earth-dwelling humans. From there, scientists can determine personalized countermeasures such as workout plans or supplements tailored to each astronaut’s needs, before they actually end up in space.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope, for those space medicine physicians like Pandya, is that in a spacefaring future, all medical disciplines — from neurology to radiology — will be represented in space medicine.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Red planet, blue planet</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Space medicine research and practice isn’t cheap.&nbsp;“I often get asked,” said Pandya, “‘Why are you spending money on space health when we have all of these problems on Earth?’” But that’s the wrong way to think about it, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Research conducted in space has already improved health on this planet. Advances in digital imaging for moon photography during the 1972 Apollo 17 mission later <a href="https://appel.nasa.gov/2025/02/24/nasa-technology-improves-life-on-earth/">played</a> a crucial role in CT scans and MRIs. Remote health monitoring tools designed for astronauts in space are now widely used in hospitals.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>One of the next big things in space medicine “is probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,” Aintablian told me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Space medicine research will also allow more people to go to space. In 2023, Pandya’s team <a href="https://astronauticsinstitute.org/flight-opportunities-program">demonstrated</a> the safety and functionality of a continuous glucose monitor in the spaceflight environment. This could eventually allow diabetics to check their blood sugar in space. It has implications for current astronauts, who can develop insulin resistance and pre-diabetes symptoms in longer-duration spaceflights. The child diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes who wants to be an astronaut may actually have the chance to live out their dream now, and studying how the body metabolizes glucose in space helps us better understand health on Earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are the diseases that take decades to unfold. Muscle loss in space can help scientists better understand how to treat conditions like Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy. On Earth, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s often aren’t apparent <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-symptoms-and-diagnosis/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease">until</a> a person is in their late 60s.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In microgravity, said Shelby Giza, the director of business development at <a href="https://spacetango.com">Space Tango</a>, a company that facilitates automated research and development in microgravity conditions, “you can see that kind of disease output in a matter of weeks.” Research on these conditions can be conducted much faster — and hopefully accelerate the pace of medical breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The same can be said for cancer. Not all radiation exposures are made equal, and susceptibility to the harmful effects of radiation varies between individuals. Since the ISS is within the protection of Earth’s magnetosphere, it’s not the best comparison to the elevated radiation levels astronauts would face on Mars.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">According to former NASA astronaut and biologist Kate Rubins, most astronauts are healthy people in their 30s and 40s, an age when cancer typically doesn’t develop. Scientists must track astronauts for decades after their last spaceflight to see if cancer or other adverse health conditions occur. NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/lifetime-surveillance-of-astronaut-health-lsah/">Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health</a> program, which is voluntary for former astronauts and not specific to cancer alone, monitors the health status of people like Kelly and Rubins for the rest of their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Exposure to space radiation is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/analog-field-testing/why-space-radiation-matters/">linked</a> to developing cancer and degenerative diseases. To mitigate the risk of developing fatal cancers, NASA currently <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/radiation-protection-technical-brief-ochmo.pdf">limits</a> astronauts’ spaceflight radiation exposure to 600 millisieverts (mSv) — roughly the <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000026.htm#:~:text=10%20millisieverts%20equal%201%20roentgen,will%20die%20within%2030%20days.">equivalent</a> of 60 CT scans of the torso and pelvis — over the course of their entire career. A 2023 NASA white paper <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/human-health-and-performance.pdf">estimates</a> that a healthy astronaut will have a 33 percent increased risk of dying from cancer in their lifetime after a 1,000-day mission to Mars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the next big things in space medicine “is probably going to be the development of radiation protection mechanisms,” Aintablian told me. “I do believe that with the amount of emphasis being placed on radiation protection, we&#8217;re going to figure out ways to actually protect against significant amounts of radiation for the general public for multiple uses.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s still relatively early days for the space pharma industry, life science companies are <a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-development/Pharma-goes-space-drug-development/100/i40">taking</a> note, seeing microgravity as a platform for better drug discovery.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/optical-fiber-production/">fiber optic cables</a> used for telecommunications, some pharmaceuticals are better synthesized in microgravity conditions. Scientists can <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/creating-new-and-better-drugs-with-protein-crystal-growth-experiments/">produce</a> more uniform protein crystals in microgravity, which can improve drug injectability and reduce the need for refrigeration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Raphael Roettgen, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of space biotech startup Prometheus Life Technologies, told me that organoids — those 3D cell models replicating human organs — grow more cleanly in space without Earth’s gravity weighing them down. Derived from non-embryonic stem cells, these miniature organ models have tremendous potential for personalized medicine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Roettgen hopes that human space organoids could reduce the need for animal testing in the near term. Eventually, he hopes that new organs could be regenerated for patients needing transplants. Since the new tissue would be derived from the patient’s own stem cells, there would not be a risk of immune rejection, saving transplant patients astronomical costs and immense suffering. He estimates that liver regeneration and transplants from these organoids could become a reality in patients within the next 20 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microgravity is an “expensive tool,” but an important one nonetheless, said Mozneb, who studies the effects of low earth orbit on stem cell differentiation. She hopes increasing commercialization and new technologies will significantly decrease the cost of launching experiments into orbit over the next 10 years.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we already know about space medicine is a drop in the ocean of what we will discover as more people — astronauts and otherwise — venture into space.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s like if you were studying genetics back in the ’90s,” Mozneb said. “Everything is a discovery.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> President Donald Trump took a chaotic, and at times, incoherent turn through the 80th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, upending US policy on the Russia-Ukraine war in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What just happened?</strong> Trump started his day with a bizarre speech to the assembled world leaders, at points attacking other countries, efforts to address climate change, and the United Nations itself. The address was noticeably light on policy and heavy on false claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, Trump made at least two potentially significant pronouncements: NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets that violate their airspace, and Ukraine should push to reclaim all of its original territory from Russia.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the context?</strong> Trump has been inconsistent about US policy on the war. Last month, he hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, that was widely perceived as a win for the Russian president; today’s statement marks an about-face on Trump’s stated vision for an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Trump has intermittently appeared disillusioned about his relationship with Putin, including in remarks today with French President Emmanuel Macron. Coupled with his answer on how NATO countries should respond to airspace violations and his new position on the war, this would be the most aggressive stance of his presidency toward Russia — if he sticks with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> Trump changes his mind on even the biggest policy questions, and he’s often subject to the opinions of the people he last spoke with (in this case, Zelenskyy and European leaders supporting him, like Macron). That makes covering what he says in major moments like these difficult, but his pronouncements can have serious real-world implications. Whether they constitute a meaningful policy shift remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week in “science” according to politicians, President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are now warning pregnant women to avoid Tylenol — yes, <em>Tylenol </em>— because of its supposed link to autism. Never mind that there’s no strong scientific evidence to back that up. It’s just the latest example of a clear trend in this administration: ideology-first policymaking.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, a low-profile but high-stakes meeting on the country’s vaccine guidance flew under the radar, but there was major drama —&nbsp;and again more ideology on display than science.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy’s handpicked vaccine advisory committee met to update the schedule recommended to millions of parents across the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The meeting was chaotic and confusing — even to some of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices members. “I’m not sure what I’m voting on,” said Cody Meissner, one of its members. By the end of a grueling two-day session, the results were mixed. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations">committee walked back</a> its previous recommendation of the Covid vaccines and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5546769/cdc-vaccine-acip-hepatitis-b-covid">postponed</a> a vote that would delay the first vaccination for hepatitis B in newborns. But it <em>did</em> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-jr-trump-panel-covid19-mmr-e4d5564178cfd01f5abafe74e6d7d57a">recommend</a> that children under 4 years old shouldn’t get a combined MMRV shot — and should instead get separate ones for MMR and chickenpox, or varicella.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The chaotic meeting underscored our fractured state of public health guidance and what it means for our future. If even top government health officials can’t agree on immunizations, how are parents supposed to know what’s best for their kids?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To untangle all of this, we spoke with Dr. William Moss, a former pediatrician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center. We get into the history of vaccination schedules, why countries can’t agree on the same one, and how public health officials should build trust with vaccine-hesitant parents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The way I kind of look at it when I put my pediatrician&#8217;s hat on is that all parents want to do what&#8217;s right for their child. “But,” Moss told <em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Noel King, “sometimes the risk of the disease can be underestimated. And that&#8217;s a large part due to the success of vaccines and the fact that we don&#8217;t see many of these vaccine diseases anymore.”&nbsp;</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP5496865472" width="100%"></iframe>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://pandora.app.link/jgYqd4gxyWb">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When and why did we first start thinking that kids should be getting vaccines on this unified schedule?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s actually a long history of guidance on immunizations here in this country, and it&#8217;s gotten obviously more complicated as more vaccines have been introduced, but you can trace it all the way back to the 1930s when the <a href="https://www.aap.org/?srsltid=AfmBOooZ6JEgrGjL14DNKU9kdqIxhk7FDETv0PNiC4I_4Bm8oCuniiyK">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> started issuing guidance on childhood vaccines.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At that time, it was really just the smallpox vaccine, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine. Then, as more vaccines got added: In the mid-1950s, the inactivated polio vaccine, in the early 1960s, the measles vaccine, and the oral polio vaccine. It was recognized that we needed experts to think through what the appropriate schedule should be for children.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And so in 1964, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was established. For many years, they issued ad hoc recommendations, and the American Academy of Pediatrics continued to issue its own guidelines. But in the mid-1990s, ACIP got together with the American Academy of Pediatrics and issued what is really considered the first unified immunization schedule for children.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I don&#8217;t know if you were around and working in the field in 1995, but I would imagine that the feeling at the time was, “Okay, we are now organized. We have this under control. Everybody&#8217;s gonna be more or less following the same rules.” Do I have that right?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I think there was. I was in my early days of my pediatric training in 1995. There was a recognition that we needed to have this unification of the immunization schedule or standardization of this immunization schedule. And it was really bringing together the key expert groups, getting them aligned. There were some differences before that, which created some confusion, so having this unified immunization schedule in the mid 1990s was a big advance.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“When I put my pediatrician&#8217;s hat on, I see parents who want to do what&#8217;s right for their child. But what I also see sometimes is that the risk of the disease can be underestimated.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You&#8217;ve worked throughout the world, and so you know that these vaccine schedules differ, even across developed countries. If the schedule that we have here in the US is what is best, why do Denmark and the UK have different schedules for childhood vaccinations?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The way I would think about it is that there&#8217;s not one true, you know, “the best” immunization schedule. These immunization schedules involve trade-offs. So, for example, one thing of big consideration is just the disease burden, the epidemiology of a particular disease. How big of a problem is it in a particular country? What age group is most impacted by that disease? Is it multiple doses or a single dose of a vaccine? Can the vaccine doses be aligned so that you can minimize the number of healthcare visits? </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there are economic considerations: the cost of the vaccine. Who&#8217;s paying for the vaccine in that setting? The UK and the United States have very different health care financing systems, so that can drive differences in decisions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You can see that not having one right answer gives people pause.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, I can understand that, but I don&#8217;t think it should. I think people can understand that, in many things in life, there&#8217;s not <em>one</em> right answer. That opens the door for some flexibility. If a parent wants to space out a vaccine, they can do that in consultation with their health care provider. There are risks, obviously, in delaying vaccination because then their child is at risk for that disease during that longer period before they&#8217;re vaccinated.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Vaccines and their schedules have become highly contentious, with a lot of confusing and unhelpful noise out there. It’s not surprising that many well-meaning parents feel overwhelmed and uncertain. One common question I keep hearing is: Are infants getting too many vaccines at once? How should parents realistically approach and think about this question?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a couple of things nested within that. One is just seeing their child get multiple injections with a needle at the same time, knowing that that causes their child discomfort. And I think that is part of it. Sometimes parents are concerned — and this is where the evidence is less supportive — that their child&#8217;s immune system is being exposed to too much at one time. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any kind of biological or immunological basis for that. Our bodies are being exposed to foreign antigens, as we call them, all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s very important for those of us in public health and certainly those on the front line, administering vaccines, to listen to parents, to hear their concerns, but to also try to allay unfounded fears.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There has been a drawing of sides here that seems very unfortunate to me. For example, if you have questions about the vaccine schedule, people might say, “You&#8217;re a conspiracist. You’re a threat to public health. You’re a threat to my kids.” If you feel comfortable with the existing science around vaccines, then you&#8217;re participating in a broken system. You&#8217;re not asking the kinds of questions you should ask on behalf of your kids. What do you make of this divide?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I put my pediatrician&#8217;s hat on, I see parents who want to do what&#8217;s right for their child. But what I also see sometimes is that the risk of the disease can be underestimated. And that&#8217;s a large part due to the success of vaccines and the fact that we don&#8217;t see many of these vaccine-preventable diseases anymore.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is there any room for improvement on our childhood vaccine schedules? The design of them, the way that they&#8217;re updated, the messaging around them? Or is everything being done exactly right?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I would certainly say not everything&#8217;s being done exactly right, and there&#8217;s always room for improvement. But what I&#8217;ll emphasize is — what&#8217;s really important — is that process by which the immunization schedule is reviewed and updated. That&#8217;s so critical to making sure that good, sound decisions are being made and to ensure the trust in those decisions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump just transformed America’s high-skill immigration system.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/">proclamation</a> Friday, the president imposed a $100,000 fee on all new applications for H-1B visas (although the administration would retain the right to offer companies exemptions at will).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such visas have long <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/395516/musk-sanders-h1b-visa-immigration-trump">been controversial</a>. The H-1B program is meant to help American employers hire foreign workers with rare intellectual abilities. It aims to ensure that the US “knowledge economy” is not undermined by shortfalls of highly skilled labor. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some companies have used the program to essentially <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1628728/southern-california-edison-it-workers-beyond-furious-over-h-1b-replacements-2.html">replace</a> US workers with immigrants — less because the latter boast exceptional skills than because they have lower wage expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s $100,000 fee is ostensibly meant to fix this problem. In theory, employers won’t pay that hefty charge to hire a garden-variety foreign coder over an American one. Rather, a company would only be willing to foot that bill for extraordinary foreign talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the president’s policy addresses legitimate complaints with the H-1B system, however, it does so in a needlessly costly manner. Trump’s exorbitant fee would undermine American scientific research, technological progress, and economic growth. And this would translate into lower wages for American workers in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<li>The H-1B visa is a temporary US work visa for people in “specialty occupations” — jobs that typically require at least a bachelor’s degree.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Its aim is to help American employers hire foreign workers with advanced intellectual skills, when they are unable to find similarly capable laborers domestically.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The number of annual H-1B visas is capped for private-sector employers at 85,000 (20,000 of those slots are reserved for workers who have attained a master&#8217;s degree or higher from a US institution of higher education). For many universities, nonprofits, and government research institutions, there is no cap.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Demand for private-sector visas far outstrips supply. So eligible applicants are entered into a lottery and then chosen at random.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The problem with the H-1B visa program, briefly explained</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems with H-1B visas mostly stem from how they’re allocated.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Demand for such visas far outstrips their supply: In 2023, <a href="https://archive.ph/fdVF7">446,000</a> people sought an H-1B visa, but America only provides 85,000 of them each year (20,000 of which are reserved for workers who have attained a master&#8217;s degree or higher from a US institution of higher education).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether a given worker secures an H-1B visa is left largely to chance. Instead of prioritizing the most skilled applicants — or those pursuing the highest-paid jobs — the government selects them at random through a lottery.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This process actually favors low-wage employers seeking to hire workers with middling abilities. If you’re an AI firm that’s looking to hire one particular machine learning engineer who holds superlative skills, you will probably lose the H-1B lottery. After all, any individual applicant has a low chance of getting selected.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, if you’re an outsourcing company that’s looking to hire lots of foreign workers with basic IT skills, your odds of winning the lottery are quite good. Such companies don’t need any specific candidate, only a large number of interchangeable laborers. So, they can sponsor many more workers than they actually need and then take whichever ones happen to make it through the filter. If too many of their workers get selected, they can simply decline to complete all of their applications. By flooding the lottery in this way, IT staffing and outsourcing firms secured 40 percent of all H-1B visas in 2023, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-staffing-firms-game-h1b-visa-lottery-system/">a Bloomberg investigation</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is suboptimal for the American economic dynamism. Helping cutting-edge tech firms access top talent is better for innovation than helping outsourcing companies hire mediocre IT support specialists. And doing the latter also entails higher tradeoffs for native-born workers, since outsourcing firms subvert the H-1B program’s labor protections.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To secure an H-1B visa, companies <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/new-evidence-widespread-wage-theft-in-the-h-1b-program/#epi-toc-4">must pledge</a> that they will pay their applicant at least as much as they currently pay similar American employees. A company, therefore, cannot lay off its existing IT workforce and then hire lower-wage H-1B workers in their place.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet a firm can eliminate its IT department — and then delegate those functions to an outsourcing company, which is largely staffed by H-1B workers. In this way, companies can use the H-1B program to effectively replace domestic workers. And some <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/h-1b-visas-and-prevailing-wage-levels/">have in fact done this.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why Trump’s fee would make the H-1B system worse</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s $100,000 application fee constitutes one answer to the H-1B program’s allocation problem. Outsourcing companies aren’t going to shell out that kind of money for entry-level IT specialists.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, a well-capitalized firm seeking a specific, exceptionally talented foreign worker may consider $100,000 to be a “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/s16h_if-youre-on-an-h-1b-visa-and-your-company-activity-7375265801223974912-nWCP/">rounding error</a>” (as one tech CEO called it Sunday).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s policy is therefore likely to increase the proportion of H-1B visas going to immigrants with genuinely rare skills,</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Trump’s fee entails far greater costs than benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the latter front, the White House’s policy won’t necessarily safeguard the jobs and wages of native-born IT specialists. Companies can often replace their American tech support staff with remote workers abroad. And <a href="http://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/22/the-perverse-consequence-of-americas-100000-visa-fees">as the Economist </a>notes, top outsourcing companies responded to the last crackdown on their H-1B access by shifting their hiring towards India. Meanwhile, AI is enabling<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/01/it-support-at-work-is-one-of-the-first-jobs-on-ais-replacement-ticket.html"> the rapid automation</a> of many IT functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump’s policy would do relatively little to insulate American IT workers from competition, it would do a great deal to undermine economic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is because the president’s fee wouldn’t merely change the distribution of H-1B visas, but dramatically reduce their total supply.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, it’s not clear that private sector employers would be willing to sponsor 85,000 visas a year, at the price of $100,000 per application.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More critically, the statutory cap on H-1B visas does not apply to many universities and nonprofits. If forced to pay $100,000 per worker, however, such research institutions would likely need to turn away many exceptional foreign scholars. Scientific research often generates large economic and social benefits in the long term, but scant profits in the short run. Thus, in many cases, universities will not be able to finance guest workers’ applications, even if their labor is highly valuable to the United States.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the very least, many schools and smaller American companies would struggle to offer foreign workers competitive wages, if they were forced to eat $100,000 on each hire: A European university that has a $350,000 budget for a research position could actually offer a higher salary than an American university with a $400,000 for an analogous position, because the latter school would need to spend $100,000 just to get its applicant into the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">American science is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/407586/immigration-crackdown-foreign-students-science-innovation-funding">already reeling</a> from the Trump administration’s cuts to NIH grants and revocation of student visas. The president’s H-1B policy threatens to further undermine the competitiveness of US research institutions and chase more academic talent abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>High-skill immigration is good for Americans</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To some on the populist right, sustaining American universities’ access to international scholars may seem like an elitist concern. From this perspective, the priority must be improving American workers’ wages and job opportunities. If US schools can’t find enough native-born scientists to staff their labs, then they should do a better job of educating their American students.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But this perspective grossly underestimates the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/392104/immigration-surge-trump-biden-democrats-moderate-border">economic benefits</a> of immigration in general, and high-skill migration in particular.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even in its current, dysfunctional form, the H-1B visa program appears to boost wages and employment opportunities for American workers. This is true for at least three reasons:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A larger workforce enables a greater degree of <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15507">labor specialization</a> and, thus, productivity.</li>
<li>H-1B workers specifically facilitate higher rates of innovation, which in turn enables companies to increase profits and hiring.&nbsp; Economists have found that increases in the H-1B visa cap are associated with <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/09-005_005359f2-2ee8-4d73-b248-af492e44ecb4.pdf">a jump in patents</a>, and that winners of the H-1B lottery subsequently introduce <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3207942">more new products</a> and hire <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/KKL-JOLE15_06018502-4e9b-45de-8631-e57223499317.pdf">more native-born workers</a>.</li>
<li>The presence of skilled labor can attract investment: The larger the pool of STEM workers in a given city, the more incentive that tech companies have to open or expand operations there. And the entrance of such firms into an area can improve conditions throughout its labor market. A <a href="https://giovanniperi.ucdavis.edu/uploads/5/6/8/2/56826033/stem-workers.pdf">2015 study</a> found that increases in H-1B holders at the municipal level correlated with wage gains for native-born workers, both college-educated and non-college-educated.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s reason to think this same pattern holds at the national level — that companies are more likely to invest in countries that have lots of highly skilled labor. Researchers <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27538">have found</a> that when multinational firms lose access to H-1B workers, they tend to replace them by increasing hiring abroad. This effectively transfers dollars out of the US economy and into foreign ones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For these reasons, any reform of the H-1B system that reduces high-skill immigration in the US will hurt American workers in the aggregate.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are better ways to fix the H-1B program</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The H-1B visa program is falling short of its official objectives: It leaves many cutting-edge firms unable to hire top foreign talent, and undermines the bargaining power of some native-born workers.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are better ways to address these issues than Trump’s $100,000 fee. For example, the government could distribute visas on the basis of compensation rather than a lottery: Rather than distributing 85,000 slots at random each year, it could award them to the 85,000 applicants offered the highest-paying jobs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the president’s approach would reduce America’s dynamism and living standards — while tilting the economic playing field towards the administration’s cronies (who are liable to have an easier time securing fee exemptions). In this way, it is of a piece with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462076/trump-democracy-jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk">Trump’s broader agenda</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Palestinian statehood has never had so much international support — or seemed less attainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As world leaders gather in New York City on Monday for the UN General Assembly, the question of Palestinian statehood is at the top of the agenda. On Sunday, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/21/world/europe/starmer-uk-recognize-palestinian-state.html?ref=abuaardvarkghost.ghost.io">confirmed</a> that they now recognize Palestine as an independent state, following France, which announced its intention to do so last July and formalized it with a speech by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, and Malta, among others,<strong> </strong>have announced plans to recognize Palestine as well. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, representatives of most of the world’s countries — but not the United States or Israel — gathered on the sidelines of the assembly for a <a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/high-level-conference-two-state-solution-july2025/">meeting</a>, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, to discuss implementing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also missed the meeting after being denied a visa to travel to New York by the United States, but addressed the assembly by video. Monday’s meeting <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-overwhelmingly-endorses-two-state-solution-declaration-that-condemns-hamas-2025-09-12/">followed the passage</a>, on September 12, of a UN General Assembly resolution now being referred to as the “<a href="https://onu.delegfrance.org/new-york-declaration">New York declaration</a>,” outlining &#8220;tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps&#8221; toward a two-state solution. The resolution was backed by<strong> </strong>142 of the assembly’s 193 members.<strong> </strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at Monday’s meeting. “Without two states, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and radicalism will spread around.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Washington, <a href="https://www.merkley.senate.gov/merkley-leads-historic-call-for-u-s-recognition-of-palestinian-statehood/">a new resolution cosponsored by eight senators</a> calls on President Donald Trump to recognize Palestinian statehood. Calling for a two-state solution is hardly a radical position in US politics, but calling for unilateral recognition of Palestine — rather than supporting a process by which a Palestinian state would emerge out of negotiations — is a more dramatic step, and it’s unlikely the resolution would have gotten even this level of support before the war in Gaza. Still, even though none of those senators are Republicans, and the resolution is unlikely to pass, the level of support for a measure that calls for unilateral recognition is an <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/09/18/america-is-falling-out-of-love-with-israel">indication of how politics on this issue have shifted in the United States</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not that any of this is swaying the Israeli government. “There will be no Palestinian state. This place is ours,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/netanyahu-vowsthere-palestinian-stateahead-meeting/story?id=125489981">declared earlier this month</a> at a ceremony announcing Israel’s expansion of the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim. In fact, his government is weighing formally annexing parts of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/01/middleeast/israel-west-bank-annexation-palestinian-state-intl">the West Bank in retaliation</a> for the wave of recognition by Western governments. This in turn prompted a warning from the United Arab Emirates — arguably the most significant of the Arab countries that normalized relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term — that it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uae-could-downgrade-diplomatic-ties-if-israel-annexes-west-bank-sources-say-2025-09-18/">downgrade diplomatic ties </a>if Israel went ahead with annexation. At the same time, the war in Gaza is only escalating, as the Israel Defense Forces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/hundreds-thousands-flee-israeli-militarys-devastating-assault-gaza-cit-rcna232359">advance into Gaza City and thousands flee</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality in Israel and Palestine is so intractable that it raises the question of whether the global mobilization behind statehood is anything more than political theater. It also raises the possibility that the world may be coming to consensus on Palestinian statehood just as it slips out of reach as a realistic possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Breakthrough or theater?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared independence in 1988, some 145 countries have recognized Palestine, including the recent additions, according to a tally by <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-recognizes-the-state-of-palestine-who-doesnt-and-why-does-it-matter/">Agence France Presse</a>. That includes nearly all of Africa, Latin America, and the former Communist bloc. Most of those who do <em>not </em>recognize it are close US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Western Europe had, for the most part, refrained from recognizing, but that has shifted rapidly during the war in Gaza, with Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia making the decision to recognize Palestine last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The additions of Britain and France to the list are particularly significant, as it means that the United States is now the last permanent member of the UN Security Council that does not recognize a Palestinian state. Palestine currently has “<a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148351">permanent observer status</a>” at the UN, meaning it can participate in debates, but not vote on resolutions in the main UN bodies. The Security Council has to approve new members and all five permanent members have veto power, so membership is not on the table for now. But the Senate resolution suggests that won’t necessarily be the case forever. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), one of the cosponsors of the resolution, told Vox that the senators pursued it because “we have to create some light at the end of the very dark tunnel in the Middle East right now.” He added: “I do believe that the best way to ensure security and dignity and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians is through a two-state solution.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/french-president-emmanuel-macron-face-the-nation-transcript-09-21-2025/">interview with CBS</a> on Sunday, Macron said that “recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/SecRubio/status/1948551777504174570">has charged</a> that France’s move is a “reckless decision that only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace.” Macron countered that in fact it would “isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians” and provide an alternative political vision. Notably, the New York declaration, which the majority of Arab states supported, calls for disarming Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Skepticism about the recognition declarations has come not just from supporters of Israel, but also from its critics, who see recognition as a means for governments to deflect criticism over their failure to hold Israel to account for the carnage in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is worse than political theater,” said <a href="https://arabcenterdc.org/team/dr-tamara-kharroub/">Tamara Kharroub</a>, deputy executive director of the Arab Center in Washington, DC. “It’s a smokescreen to mask their decades-long failure to implement this very two-state solution and to end Israel’s occupation and apartheid, and their complicity in the genocide that has been taking place in Gaza for the past two years.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/richard-gowan">Richard Gowan</a>, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said the flurry of activity around Palestinian statehood at the UN this week would be a form of “fantasy diplomacy.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that the leaders of these countries “felt they had to make a declaration, but there isn&#8217;t really a plan to go with it. The only way that you can really back this up would be for these countries and the wider UN membership to agree to some sort of framework for sanctions against Israel. I just don&#8217;t think the political will is there to put the amount of pressure on Israel that you would need to actually dissuade Netanyahu and his government from the current course of action.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Two-state dreams, one-state reality</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile on the ground in Israel and occupied territories, a two-state solution looks farther off than ever. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/03/israeli-public-is-increasingly-skeptical-about-lasting-peace/">Only 21 percent of Israelis</a> believe their country can coexist peacefully with a Palestinian state, according to a Pew poll, down 14 percentage points since before Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attacks. (The infeasibility of a two-state solution may ironically be one of the few things <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/650636/dim-outlook-peace-middle-east.aspx">Israelis and Palestinians can agree on</a>.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As the war in Gaza drags on, members of Netanyahu’s government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are now publicly discussing proposals to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/28/israels-smotrich-calls-for-phased-gaza-annexation-if-hamas-does-not-disarm">annex parts of the enclave if Hamas</a> does not surrender; late last week, Smotrich touted the territory as a potential “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y59z6rznvo">real estate bonanza</a>.” Those comments are in line with Trump’s apparently <a href="http://washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/31/trump-gaza-plan-riviera-relocation/">still active proposals</a> to turn Gaza into a tourist resort after the “voluntary” relocation of its civilian population.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Israeli officials have also discussed responding to the wave of Palestine recognitions by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c86cb087-da8c-4e4f-926c-40804b3992e2">formally annexing parts of the West Bank</a>. This could take several forms: from annexing Israeli settlements close to Israel, to annexing the area along the border between the West Bank and Jordan, to annexing all of what’s known as “Area C” — the 60 percent of the West Bank currently under Israeli security control. Far-right ministers like Smotrich have proposed going even further and dissolving the Palestinian Authority entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Van Hollen, who recently visited the West Bank, dismissed these threats, saying it’s clear that plans for annexation are already underway. “For them to pretend that the actions they&#8217;re taking in the West Bank are in response to calls for recognition of a Palestinian state is just a cover story,” he said. “It&#8217;s a big lie.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.inss.org.il/person/guzanskyyoel/">Yoel Guzansky</a>, a former Israeli government adviser who now leads the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, told Vox that Netanyahu “needs a green light from the Trump administration” to move ahead with annexation. “He could not do it without it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his advisers <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/what-the-hell-was-that-netanyahu-annexation-announcement-caught-trump-off-guard/">have sent mixed signals on the issue</a> over the years. Axios has reported, citing Israeli officials, that Rubio, who visited Israel earlier this month, has signaled that the Trump administration is not opposed to annexation, but other administration officials disputed the Israeli <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/13/rubio-netanyahu-israeli-annexation-west-bank">characterization</a>. While a “two-state solution” was long bipartisan orthodoxy in Washington, Trump has suggested in the past he’s not wedded to the idea, and some members of his administration, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/11/west-bank-annexation-evangelical/680658/">openly annexationist</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What may deter Trump from giving Netanyahu a green light is the effect that annexation would have on one of his signature accomplishments: the Abraham Accords. Even a “limited” annexation of West Bank territory would likely drive a deeper wedge between Israel and its erstwhile partners in the Arab world. West Bank annexation would be another red line crossed, and the government of the UAE — which has close relations with the Trump administration — has warned the White House <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/03/israel-annex-west-bank-uae-trump-abraham-accords">that it could unravel the accords</a>, entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Guzansky said that the Abraham Accords countries “might not cancel the agreement entirely” if Israel went ahead with annexation, but that the agreements are “becoming an empty shell of something that was once seen as a model peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors, a ‘Cold Peace’ agreement.” That could mean the Arab states continue cooperating with Israel on security, but do so without the people-to-people exchanges or deeper political and economic integration that the accords had promised.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Israel’s path toward isolation</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years ago, Netanyahu likely would have also pointed to normalizing relations between Israel and countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco as one of the crowning foreign policy achievements of his long era in office. The grand prize, normalization with Saudi Arabia, seemed at least a realistic possibility. The Abraham Accords saw many Arab governments willing to sidestep the Palestinian issue to find common ground with Israel on trade and their shared rivalry with Iran.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The sheer level of devastation in Gaza, though, and the global reaction to it, have made that sidestepping much more difficult for even the most jaded and autocratic governments to maintain. Israel’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/419650/israel-mowing-grass-iran-hezbollah-yemen">military strikes throughout the Middle East</a> in recent months, particularly the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/460845/qatar-hamas-israel-gaza">recent airstrike on Qatar</a>, have further convinced these governments that Israel is increasingly a source of regional instability.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent speech, Netanyahu <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-admits-israel-is-economically-isolated-will-need-to-become-self-reliant/">warned Israel</a> that it would likely have to accept an increasingly isolated position on the world stage for the time being, and transform into a “super Sparta” and “adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Regional integration and good relations with its neighbors would be nice, in other words, but in the Israeli government’s view, if the price is a negotiated end to the war in Gaza and serious steps toward accepting Palestinian statehood, it’s just not worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This week’s events in New York<strong> </strong>are unlikely to bring about a Palestinian state in reality — or end the carnage in Gaza — but they may one day be seen as an inflection point in Israel’s path toward isolation on the world stage.&nbsp;</p>
