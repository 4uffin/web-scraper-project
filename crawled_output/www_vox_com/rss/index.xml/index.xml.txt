<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Welcome to The Logoff:</strong> The Trump administration has ended a federal bribery investigation into one of its top immigration officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong> Last year, President Donald Trump&#8217;s “border czar” Tom Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from “businessmen” — undercover FBI agents — in exchange for promising to help secure government contracts, spurring a Justice Department investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan was a private citizen when he is said to have accepted the cash, but he had boasted about playing a prominent role in a potential second Trump administration in the months leading up to the payment. The investigation was closed earlier this year by the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Homan?</strong> As border czar, Homan has been one of the public faces of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown. He served as acting ICE director in Trump’s first term, and claimed last year that he would “run the biggest deportation operation this country’s ever seen.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What has the Trump administration said about the case?</strong> The White House denied Homan accepted the money — despite the reported existence of an audio recording of him doing so — and described the investigation into Homan as entrapment and “another example of the weaponization of the Biden DOJ.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> The Homan story — thousands in cash delivered clandestinely in a takeout bag — would be a major scandal in any other era, under any other administration. Here, it’s one data point in a growing body of evidence for the politicization of Trump’s DOJ, including the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/19/trump-letitia-james-erik-siebert-virginia/">Friday resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert</a> and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/20/trump-bondi-truth-social-00574380">subsequent Truth Social post</a> by Trump calling for criminal charges against his political opponents. </p>

Support our journalism by </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/support-membership?itm_campaign=jan-2025-critical&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=in-article"><em>becoming a member today</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During a highly anticipated announcement today, President Donald Trump urged pregnant people to avoid taking Tylenol if possible because of the painkiller’s possible link to autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, Trump promoted <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/leucovorin-oral-route-intravenous-route-injection-route/description/drg-20064503">leucovorin</a>, a decades-old medication that mimics folic acid and is often used to restore nutrients in patients who are taking chemotherapy drugs. The folate-based treatment has been investigated in a few small clinical trials as a possible therapeutic for children with autism.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before we get any further: The link between Tylenol and autism is unclear, and physician groups still <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ACOGNational/posts/acetaminophen-remains-a-safe-trusted-option-for-pain-relief-during-pregnancy-des/1180418200784501/">recommend</a> the medicine for pregnant people experiencing pain or fever, in consultation with their doctor. The link between vaccines and autism has been studied exhaustively, and <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism">no connection has been found</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Delivering leucovorin could, in theory, improve symptoms —&nbsp;and, in those small experiments, some parents and investigators have been thrilled with the results, as well as the strong safety profile.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the evidence here is also still very limited; one study involved fewer than 50 patients. It is not clear whether this drug would work for all patients on the autism spectrum.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/rfk-interview-kaitlan-collins-maha-report">promising</a> the American public answers on autism for months. But Monday’s announcement outpaces any science that could adequately back up the administration’s guidance. The National Institutes of Health has undertaken a massive review of autism science, but, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/">according to the Washington Post</a>, that research review was not completed in time for Trump’s White House announcement.’</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has long <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103">theorized</a> that there is a link between vaccines and autism, and Trump, too, indulged in the debunked theory that autism could be caused by vaccines during Monday’s announcement. Kennedy promised during the press conference to continue that search, accusing the medical establishment of “gaslighting” mothers who are concerned about the impact on their children. The Make America Healthy Again movement <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/390309/maha-rfk-make-america-healthy-again-slippery">emphasizes</a>, in general, the possibility that pharmaceutical drugs could be causing a number of health problems in America’s children.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, many autism scientists and advocates are alarmed by the administration’s announcement. The evidence linking Tylenol to autism’s development is mixed — some studies have found an association, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31664451/">a cohort study based out of Boston</a> cited by Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary at the press conference. The cohort research<strong> </strong>involved 1,000 children; <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406">a 2024 study</a> that covered 2.5 million children in Sweden, however, concluded that no link&nbsp;exists.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s and Kennedy’s fixation that autism rates are rising — and that <em>something </em>must be driving that increase — misses some important context: Most autism scientists believe that increase is actually largely the result of more public awareness about autism, and the subtle ways that it can manifest, as well as a changing and expanding definition of what is classified as autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As for autism’s underlying causes, <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning">as I reported earlier this year</a>, our country’s leading autism scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with the development of autism-like symptoms. Those scientists acknowledge there may be some non-genetic factors that play a role&nbsp;— such as more people giving birth at a later age — but they dismiss previous claims by Kennedy that a single chemical toxin can explain the uptick in autism diagnoses.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House press conference “alarms us researchers who have committed our entire careers to better understanding autism,” said a statement from <a href="https://www.coalitionofautismscientists.org/members">the Coalition of Autism Scientists</a>. “The data cited do not support the claim that Tylenol causes autism and leucovorin is a cure, and only stoke fear and falsely suggest hope when there is no simple answer.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we actually know about Tylenol and autism, about the autism treatment that Trump pushed in his announcement, and about what may actually be driving the increase in autism cases.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evidence linking Tylenol to autism is muddy</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump said in his Oval Office announcement that the FDA would be notifying physicians of the risk of Tylenol during pregnancy. He said repeatedly, “Don’t take it,” unless you have an extremely high fever. (Current medical guidance already stipulates that a pregnant person should talk with their doctor before taking acetaminophen for fever or pain.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some scientists have argued in recent years that there may be a link between taking Tylenol during pregnancy and the development of autism. Most recently, <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0">a systematic review of six studies on the matter</a>, co-authored by the Harvard School of Public Health’s dean in August of this year, concluded there was an association between Tylenol (also known as acetaminophen in its generic form) and the onset of autism. But finding an association is not the same thing as proving a cause, and the authors of the systematic review acknowledged this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other scientists, too, pointed out limitations with the Harvard evidence review. For one, <a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01208-0/tables/2">several of the studies included</a> were small: One involved only 215 children. Second, most were observational studies that could have difficulty controlling for confounding factors, like the parents’ genetic disposition toward autism, or other drugs the pregnant person may have taken. For example, <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/autism-risk-linked-fever-during-pregnancy">fever itself</a> is already known to be a risk factor for autism and other neurodevelopmental problems in fetuses. If a pregnant person took Tylenol to treat their fever, an observational study would struggle to differentiate between whether the pain medication or the fever contributed to a child being born with autism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And lastly, by far the largest study included in the analysis — the one that covered 2.5 million children in Sweden; the next largest study involved 73,000 children across Europe — <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406">concluded</a> there was no link between Tylenol and autism after controlling for confounding factors.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When taken together, the link between Tylenol and autism is still unclear, and Monday’s announcement risks overstating the painkiller’s dangers to developing babies. “Regarding Tylenol in pregnancy, this is rushed science and not yet borne out in the data,” Stephen Scherer, director of the Center for Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, told me.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Discouraging pregnant people from taking Tylenol has its own risks. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the authors of the meta-analysis that showed a link argued only for judicious use of the drug, not eliminating it entirely. Pregnant people are already discouraged from taking ibuprofen because of a more serious risk of birth defects, leaving acetaminophen as their first and most reliable choice for relieving pain and fevers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we really know about the increase in autism rates</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The increase in autism diagnoses is very real: According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5601a1.htm">a sweeping 2000 analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, a range of 2 to 7 per 1,000, or roughly 0.5 percent of US children, were diagnosed with autism in the 1990s. That figure has risen to 1 in 35 kids, or roughly 3 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a long time, the process for diagnosing a person with autism was strictly based on speech development. But today we have criteria that include a wide range of social and emotional symptoms with three subtypes — the autism spectrum disorder we’re familiar with today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It makes sense, then, that as the criteria for autism expanded, more and more children would meet it, and autism rates would rise. And that’s precisely what happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other known risk factors — like more people now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/us-fertility-rates-down-teens-women-40-first-time-moms-rcna196809">having babies later in their life</a>, given that parental age is linked to a higher likelihood of autism — are more likely to be a factor than anything Kennedy has been pointing at, experts told me earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s very clear it’s not going to be one environmental toxin,” Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation and parent of a child with profound autism, told me back in May. “If there were a smoking gun, I think they would have found it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, many autism scientists continue to focus on genetics. Multiple studies have attributed about 80 percent of a person’s risk of <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/majority-of-autism-risk-resides-in-genes-multinational-study-suggests/">developing autism to their inherited genetic factors</a>. Clinical trials for gene-based therapies are getting underway, offering another avenue for providing relief to patients and families&nbsp; —&nbsp;but one that Kennedy, who called genetics a dead end for understanding autism, and the Trump administration have so far ignored.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration itself seems to acknowledge that Tylenol is far from a smoking gun; that’s why the NIH’s research efforts are still ongoing. But after promising for months to deliver some kind of answer on autism, this seems to be the best they could come up with. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the <a href="https://www.ifbookspod.com/">critiques</a> of the <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/self-improvement-market-recovers-from-the-pandemic-worth-13.4-billion-in-the-u.s">multibillion-dollar self-help industry</a>, it sells, launching the <a href="https://www.melrobbins.com/">high-profile careers</a> of authors and influencers and <a href="https://therulesbook.com/">ways of life</a> for its followers. What is it about self-help that we find irresistible?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the question author Jessica Lamb-Shapiro set out to answer with her book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Land-Journey-Americas-Self-Help/dp/1439100195"><em>Promise Land: My Journey Through America&#8217;s Self-Help Culture</em></a>. It’s a topic she has personal investment in. “My dad was a child psychologist, and he wrote parenting books. And I later found out that he used me as an example,” she says. Her experience left her skeptical of self-help culture, so she set out to explore it by trying the guidance in several self-help guides.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Though her experience was unique, she says it’s not all that different from the culture of self-help we all interact with. “That kind of stuff percolates, even if you&#8217;re not reading self-help books,” Lamb tells Vox. “It’s so woven into the fabric of our experience that I think everyone grew up with self-help, even if they didn&#8217;t grow up reading self-help books or having a self-help book writer for a dad.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems that when it comes to self-improvement, we just can’t help ourselves. But is this attempt at optimization actually leading to our isolation? That’s what we discuss on this week’s episode of <em>Explain It to Me</em>, Vox’s weekly call-in podcast.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of our conversation with Lamb-Shapiro, edited for length and clarity.

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How long have self-help books been around?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The first incarnation of self-help was in the mid-1800s. There was a writer named Samuel Smiles. He wrote for the Leeds Times, and there was a society called the Mutual Improvement Society. They invited him to give a lecture, and he told these anecdotes about working men rising from poverty into positions of power. It was hugely successful. People loved the stories. So he started doing more and more lectures and then eventually made it into a book. The book was called <em>Self-Help</em>. It came out in 1859. It was immediately a bestseller. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So it was popular way before I thought. You can also find predecessors in the Greek Stoics, from around 160, 180 AD. There was a Roman emperor named Marcus Aurelius who wrote a book called <em>Meditations</em>. That book is actually sold as a self-help book today. If you go to your bookstore and you look in the self-help section, you could find Marcus Aurelius’s self-help.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Every man I know reads about stoicism. So yes, I do know that name quite well.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was writing the book, I was like, oh, this is <em>Don&#8217;t Sweat the Small Stuff.</em> Do you remember that book?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a bestselling book when I was growing up — so ’80s, ’90s. And it basically is the same thing with a different, more dire message: “We&#8217;re all going to die one day, so who cares?” It’s repackaged for today&#8217;s happy America, but it is basically the same message. So any self-help book you find today, there&#8217;s always a predecessor of a hundred years or earlier.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How big is the self-help industry?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The global self-help industry is worth <a href="https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-personal-development-market">between $45 billion and $59 billion</a>. It&#8217;s also called personal growth or self-improvement, not always self-help. And this isn&#8217;t just books, but it&#8217;s also courses and TikToks and affirmation-a-day calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You did all of this work, and part of it was to find out if self-help books are a scam. Are they?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a very difficult question. I wouldn&#8217;t say that they&#8217;re a scam. There are so many self-help books. There&#8217;s good ones, there&#8217;s bad ones, there&#8217;s bad ones that have some good qualities. If you don&#8217;t take everything as gospel, you can kind of pick and choose what&#8217;s helpful and what&#8217;s not helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why are we so drawn to these books?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that whatever your life is, it could be better is really appealing. You could be richer, you could be hotter, you could be smarter, you could be more popular, you could be faster. It&#8217;s just an idea that&#8217;s very appealing to us as human beings: that we could just be more awesome than we are right now or have more awesome stuff than we have right now. I mean, I&#8217;m always trying to do things better. I&#8217;m trying to learn, I&#8217;m trying to be smarter. I&#8217;m trying to be more social, leave my house more, be a better dog owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It&#8217;s interesting because you started out pretty skeptical of self-help, going into writing this book. Do you still feel that way or have you found redeeming things in it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ve definitely found redeeming things in it. I also absolutely think you should always retain a bit of skepticism and a little bit of cynicism when you&#8217;re encountering self-help. I was in my 30s when I wrote the book. I&#8217;m in my 40s now, and a lot has happened politically and socially. The pandemic happened, and those were some tough times for me and for everybody. So I feel like I have a lot more sympathy for the urge to self-help and the idea of it, even if it doesn&#8217;t get realized in the books.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What&#8217;s changed about self-help in recent years? Anything at all?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that self-help has&nbsp;become better and more mainstream. I&#8217;m thinking of someone like Brené Brown, who is an academic researcher and actually has studies to back up the things she&#8217;s saying, but also is sometimes seen as a self-help writer. Certainly, her books have helped people. So there&#8217;s kind of an elevation of the discussion, where it&#8217;s a little bit more intellectual. I think that appeals to more people. They&#8217;ve brought in a whole new audience to self-help, and I think in a way the books have become better as a result.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you think we&#8217;re overdoing it on self-help? Are we trying too hard to fully optimize ourselves to be our best selves?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, absolutely. I think we&#8217;re obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s healthy, necessarily. Self-help books are appealing if you’re thinking, “I&#8217;m going to go to therapy for years and I&#8217;m going to spend thousands of dollars, or I could just buy this book for 20 bucks, and feel better immediately, and maybe get something out of it.”</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We&#8217;re obsessed with betterment and productivity. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s healthy, necessarily.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;But I think we&#8217;re really losing the community aspect. When you&#8217;re talking about self-help, everything is done by yourself. When you do that, you lose the opportunity to have a community and to strengthen your relationships with other people. When I try to help myself on my own, I&#8217;m still by myself. Whereas if I ask for help, I am strengthening my relationships, and I&#8217;m getting a lot more out of it than just the help that I was looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That sense of community is really important, and so many people are feeling lonely and alienated. To actually make contact with another person or an organization is really beneficial. Not just to society — because it&#8217;s definitely beneficial to society to have people invested in the community — but also to the individual to feel like they have community support and they&#8217;re not just completely isolated and alone.</p>

Our society has actively promoted two-parent families for decades, but today we&#8217;re in a particularly intense moment. We have books getting published like Get Married: Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization and The Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind. Social conservatives are talking about [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our society has actively promoted two-parent families for decades, but today we&#8217;re in a particularly intense moment. We have books getting published like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Married-Americans-Families-Civilization/dp/0063210851"><em>Get Married</em></a>: <em>Why Americans Must Defy the Elites, Forge Strong Families, and Save Civilization</em> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Two-Parent-Privilege-Americans-Stopped-Getting/dp/0226817784/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.dz5a4x6-iU2iMt7uHM2-GFO4f0nITcj6exfBYMcPdtrzUeuzyPJUPnmgmRcf24PdbUeZZNsKJUOusR-Zf3whaE1v3qx2KoycoEV6TK43Lroz4edIsXE1nsUVc4gv-9Q1v8KvyDa4ahVNxUvtQPgDVw.iytoPlBC6D38yq-YNrcBUowc55GlX56yG54tMmQNgIk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;hvadid=693355919886&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvexpln=67&amp;hvlocphy=9007538&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvocijid=11731164257905207372--&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=11731164257905207372&amp;hvtargid=kwd-2086404357326&amp;hydadcr=22163_13517541&amp;keywords=the+two-parent+privilege&amp;mcid=727f6a60e1da387ea93ed239aa14783f&amp;qid=1758015260&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Two-Parent Privilege</em></a><em>: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind</em>. Social conservatives are talking about establishing a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/03/heritage-foundation-parents-children-birth/">“Manhattan Project” for boosting birth rates</a> and nuclear families, and some on the right are even musing about <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/354635/divorce-no-fault-states-marriage-republicans">ending no-fault divorce</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sociologist Christina Cross’s new book, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674278493"><em>Inherited Inequality</em></a>: <em>Why Opportunity Gaps Persist Between Black and White Youth Raised in Two-Parent Families</em>, seeks to challenge these stories and solutions. Cross studies the outcomes of kids who grow up in two-parent Black families — a group of people she argues tends to “escape our collective imagination” — despite all the intense focus on single-parent households.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cross’s work bucks an idea that has fundamentally shaped government policy since the Moynihan Report in 1965 through welfare reform and contemporary marriage promotion initiatives: that if Black families just got married and stayed together, racial inequality would largely disappear. Her research reveals that Black kids raised by two parents still struggle far more than white kids from two-parent families, and do only about as well as white kids who only had one parent at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The numbers are stark. Black children in two-parent homes were two to four times more likely to get suspended or kicked out of school than white children with both parents. When it came time for college, there was a 25-point gap between how many Black versus white kids from two-parent families actually enrolled. By their mid-20s, Black young adults from these families were three times more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite representing half of all Black children in America, these two-parent Black families have been virtually ignored by researchers — just two out of 163 family structure studies published in leading journals between 2012 and 2022 examined their outcomes. Cross and senior correspondent Rachel Cohen Booth discussed the hidden costs of America’s marriage promotion spending, the research gaps that have allowed myths about Black families to persist, and why even two-parent Black households can’t escape structural racism. This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Your research strongly suggests that promoting these traditional two-parent families is not going to reduce racial inequality, but you do find some advantages for Black children raised in these kinds of households. Given that, do you think encouraging marriage is still a worthy policy goal or cultural aim, even if it doesn&#8217;t solve all the problems marriage advocates claim it could?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things I focus on in my book is that there’s been such a singular emphasis on promoting marriage and the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, and that this laser focus on this one intervention really limits our ability to close gaps between groups.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My research shows that even amongst Black and white children in two-parent families, inequality is very high. So the question we need to be asking ourselves is: Is this the best use of our time, attention, and resources? And are there other strategies and interventions that we could be focusing on that might be more effective? And my research suggests that yes, that is the case.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A lot of people probably will wonder why we should object to something that yes, isn’t a silver bullet, but still seems to offer some help and protection. But I think you do find costs and consequences to this approach. Could you just walk me through the costs you see of prioritizing a focus on two-parent families?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So one cost, as I was mentioning, is that when we focus simply on promoting two-parent families, it limits our ability to explore other strategies that could be more effective. There are also real economic costs as well. Many people are surprised to find that currently our federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year promoting marriage and the two-parent families.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">TANF, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, is our largest cash assistance program in the US, and this program has outlined four goals, three of which focus on promoting marriage and the two-parent family. The government spends between $250 and $400 million each year on these efforts.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re in a moment where federal funding for key safety net programs is being cut drastically. With the limited resources that are available, might we be more effective at improving children&#8217;s outcomes and reducing gaps between groups by offering direct cash assistance or assistance for child care subsidies or for education or so many other really important things that families need?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In your book you identified a theory called the Family Resource Perspective as the principal framework used by social scientists and family demographers to explain how family structure influences well-being, which seems to basically boil down to more parents raising a kid means more money and more hands on deck. That sounds intuitive, certainly, but can you talk a little bit about how your research complicates that framework?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Family Resource Perspective really emphasizes how having two parents in the home leads to more resources, more income, more wealth, more time to spend with children. But one of the things that often gets overlooked and that I highlight in my research is that these key resources are not evenly distributed, not everyone in two parent families has access to them. And unfortunately, that is especially the case when we look at Black two-parent families.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So I found that when it comes to income, Black two-parent families had about 60 percent of the income of white two-parent families and only 25 percent of the wealth. And so when we&#8217;re thinking about how important these resources are for improving child outcomes, we need to remember that if we don&#8217;t have equal inputs, we cannot expect equal outcomes,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I know this wasn&#8217;t directly in your book, but I was curious. What do we know about kids who grow up in more affluent, divorced families?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Actually, that&#8217;s a next step for me and my own research that I want to explore. Because we tend to focus on average differences. So on average, two-parent families have more resources than single-parent families. But what would it look like for a child to be raised in a single-parent family that was high-income? Or that even included other adults in the household who may not be a biological parent but who could help with child rearing? We can imagine that if resources are really driving family structures&#8217; impact on children, then more resources, and more adults in the household, could lead to better outcomes for children, even if they don&#8217;t grow up in a two-parent family.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In that same vein, what if anything did you find regarding bad marriages? Do we know if they bring any kind of different level of harm or benefit to children compared to divorce or single parenthood?</strong></p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“My work shows that even when Black people raise their children in two-parent families, inequality is still very high.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I didn&#8217;t focus specifically on marriage quality, but we know that not all marriages are created equally. It really is important to keep that in mind because we know that a child who is in a household where there is a significant amount of stress and conflict is going to be negatively impacted by that. That&#8217;s not from my own research, but there are a number of studies that do show that.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You found that Black two-parent families have increased by 15 percent over the last decade, whereas Black single-mother families have declined by roughly the same amount. What do you think is driving that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You know, it&#8217;s funny because as I was doing background research for my book, I was surprised to find this because the story has been for so long that Black two-parent families are so small and we talk about them as if they don&#8217;t even exist. So I was surprised to find that they&#8217;re increasing and actually for every Black child who lives in a single-mother family, there&#8217;s a Black child who&#8217;s growing up in a two-parent family, but so much of our focus has been on single-parent families. And so in uncovering this finding, I&#8217;m also curious to know what&#8217;s driving it. For my book, I was not pursuing that direction, but that&#8217;s actually one of the next things on my research agenda as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You have this pretty striking statistic that between 2012 and 2022, there were 163 articles published on family structure effects in the five leading family studies journals, but just two of them looked at the outcomes of Black youth in two-parent families. Why do you think that is? Were you surprised to find that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I was very surprised. I mean, I had a sense that there was less research on Black two-parent families just based on where much of our conversation currently sits focused on Black single-parent families. But to find that there were so few studies, I mean, two out of more than 160, it&#8217;s just very striking. We&#8217;ve really only begun to scratch the surface of understanding what it means to live with two parents in the home for Black children, and there&#8217;s very little empirical evidence to support some very strong claims about the power of the two-parent family for addressing racial inequality, which is why I decided to write this book.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I wanted to be able to provide some foundational facts for us to have a more accurate conversation about the role of the two-parent family and improving child outcomes and addressing one of our most intractable issues, which is racial inequality. And unfortunately, I&#8217;m finding that this family structure cannot do what we imagine that it should be doing. And that&#8217;s really, really important.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Given your critiques of America’s current approach, what policies or cultural shifts would you recommend to better help Black families and children?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So I think about these things as being two-pronged. As you mentioned, part of this is about culture and then the other part is about structure. So when thinking about culture, I think it&#8217;s important to remember the power of narrative, the power of story, because it shapes the way we think about problems and how to address them. And for so long, we&#8217;ve had a cultural narrative that says that the main reason that Black people have a harder time getting ahead is because they don&#8217;t live in the “right” type of family, that they&#8217;re less likely to raise their children within the context of a two-parent family. And as we can see in terms of our federal programming like TANF, that has led us to focus on trying to promote this family structure.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“There&#8217;s been such a focus on the nuclear family in terms of how we craft social policy. And sometimes that actually limits our ability to support families that might arrange themselves differently.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">My work shows that even when Black people raise their children in two-parent families, inequality is still very high. So part of what I hope to do in my book is to change the narrative, to present evidence that we really have not had access to because there has been so few studies on Black two-parent families. So that&#8217;s the cultural component.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But also in thinking about structure, I think it&#8217;s important for us to know that one of the main reasons why there are such huge opportunity gaps between Black and white children is that there are huge gaps in resources. Right now, we&#8217;re in a moment in which many social safety net programs are being cut — like SNAP, Medicaid, and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program. These changes in our structure are likely to widen many of the gaps that I witnessed in my book.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve seen recently some strategies that have been effective that we could potentially implement. One of them in particular is the expanded Child Tax Credit, which lifted millions of kids out of poverty in the pandemic. Another policy is marriage penalties. For some couples, it costs them more in taxes when they file as a married household than if they were to file as single individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I know a lot of conservatives </strong><a href="https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/understanding-marriage-penalties-welfare-and-their-impact-society"><strong>want to get rid of those penalties</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s true. And so that could be one strategy, but also leveraging existing assets of families. There&#8217;s been such a focus on the nuclear family in terms of how we craft social policy. And sometimes that actually limits our ability to support families that might arrange themselves differently. Black Americans are more likely to live in extended families, and there are some policies that would limit Black families’ ability to provide support to one another in this arrangement. Family leave policy, as an example: With family leave policy, folks are allowed to take leave to take care of a nuclear family member, like a spouse or child, but some people are responsible for taking care of their parents or grandparents. They might be in a situation where they&#8217;re living with siblings or cousins or other individuals who are not necessarily considered within the family leave policy. And that means that when it comes to taking care of them, they have to choose between missing out on pay.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Last year, you came in the crosshairs of Christopher Rufo, who labeled you a “Black Critical Race Theory/DEI scholar” and leveled charges of plagiarism. I know the scholars from whom you were accused of plagiarizing have </strong><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/22/cross-plagiarism-harvard-anonymous-complaint/"><strong>all rejected</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/25/cross-plagiarism-colleagues-support/"><strong>the allegations</strong></a><strong>. Harvard’s sociology department </strong><a href="https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/news/public-statement-attacks-christina-cross%E2%80%99s-scholarship-harvard-university-department"><strong>rejected it</strong></a><strong>, the head of Plagiarism Today rejected it, and the American Sociological Association </strong><a href="https://www.asanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/asa-statement-in-defense-of-christina-cross-march-2024.pdf"><strong>also rejected it</strong></a><strong>. What did you make of this kind of attack on your work, and were you surprised?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, in moments like this, I think even being singled out really speaks to the work that I&#8217;ve been doing and the fact that it has had reach outside of academia. We know that Chris Rufo is not an academic. And so, as difficult as that moment was, what that really signals to me is that I have been able to contribute to national conversations and hopefully to be able to help generate more productive conversations. And I plan on continuing to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And as you mentioned, there was so much widespread support for the work that I was doing inside and outside of academia, which I found to just be very encouraging and heartening. And so I&#8217;m gonna continue to do the work, and I&#8217;m very excited to see what will come of this book that I have written for a much broader audience.</p>

Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. Even the good news, on the rare occasion we get some, feels hollow. But for the most part, it’s bad news. The planet keeps heating up.

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Talking about climate change can feel hopeless. Even the good news, on the rare occasion we get some, feels hollow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But for the most part, it’s bad news. The planet keeps heating up. So many of the disasters we were warned about years ago are starting to pile on. Meanwhile, the oil keeps flowing, the politicians keep punting, and the systems meant to save us keep failing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now we’re staring down the barrel of another Trump presidency and the potential unraveling of what little climate progress we’ve made. But there’s a twist: Solar and wind are booming, and they’re now the world’s cheapest energy sources. Many cities, towns, and in some cases countries are running almost entirely on renewables. That is all <em>great</em> news.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But what does it actually mean? Is it too late to turn this thing around?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Bill McKibben is one of the most influential voices on the climate over the past four decades. He sounded the alarm in his 1989 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0812976088?ref=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;social_share=cm_sw_r_ffobk_cp_ud_dp_NACXYR2VV16M7Q0R3Q3C_1&amp;bestFormat=true&amp;csmig=1"><em>The End of Nature</em></a>, which many consider a foundational text of the modern environmentalist movement. He’s also founded organizations like Third Act and <a href="http://350.org">350.org</a>, the latter of which remains one of the biggest climate activist groups in the world.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">His new book, <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Here-Comes-the-Sun/"><em>Here Comes the Sun</em></a>, is about the revolution in solar and wind power and it might be the most hopeful thing he’s ever written. And that’s because we now have the tools we need to tackle this problem. The question is, do we have the political will to do it?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited McKibben onto <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about that and the many possibilities in front of us. As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This book is much more optimistic than I expected. It doesn’t feel forced; it feels like you’re genuinely excited about what’s possible.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an odd moment for me. Much of what I’ve been describing since <em>The End of Nature</em> in the late ’80s is now happening in real time. We’re watching the climate system come apart. Politically, I don’t think I’ve lived through a bleaker period. And yet, at the same time, I have news of one big good thing: a transformation in how we make and use energy that’s actually moving fast enough to matter. So I get to be the bearer of some good news, for once.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You’re clear that we’re past being able to “stop” global warming. So what’s the plausible goal now?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Stopping warming entirely isn’t on the menu. What might still be on the menu is stopping it short of the point where it cuts civilization off at the knees. That’s the goal here. Recent science about the jet stream, the Gulf stream, and the atmosphere’s moisture content is scary. These are enormous systems with momentum. But every tenth of a degree matters. Each tenth we avoid keeps tens or hundreds of millions of people within a livable climate zone. That remains the biggest task humans have ever had: Keep the damage within survivable limits.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Right — this isn’t binary. Degrees matter. Fractions of degrees matter.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why the clean energy news is so important. I’ve covered this long enough to feel the ground shifting, and the pace has surprised even people in the climate and energy world. California, which is the fourth-largest economy on Earth, has quietly hit a tipping point. On many days, it supplies more than 100 percent of its power for long stretches from clean energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When the sun goes down, batteries that spent the afternoon soaking up surplus sunshine now become the biggest source of electricity. The net result is that California used about 40 percent less natural gas for electricity this summer than two years ago. If that spreads globally, you start shaving tenths of a degree off the future. That’s the best number I’ve heard in almost 40 years of doing this.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We’re talking in mid-August, more than six months into President Donald Trump’s second term. He ran promising to “drill, baby, drill” and to kneecap electric vehicles. Has he delivered?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s doing extraordinary damage and he’s doing it with the spineless support of a lot of Republicans who know better.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll make two points. First, this is a global crisis and a global energy market. What Trump is really doing — and this should make any American furious — is ceding the energy future to China, often for technologies that were developed here<em>.</em> We invented the solar cell and the lithium-ion battery. Now we’re practically handing the future to Beijing on a platter. In the long run, that might still be good for the planet because they’re pushing these technologies everywhere, but it’s a staggering abdication by the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, even here at home, the story isn’t finished. The most interesting state in America for energy right now is Texas. It’s installing renewables faster than California. In the spring, fossil fuel interests tried to ram through a “DEI for gas” bill, which is basically forcing one unit of gas buildout for every unit of solar. People in rural Texas came out of the woodwork to say, <em>Don’t do this.</em> Wind and solar keep schools open, fund elder care. These are real, tangible benefits. The legislature backed down. So even in red states, the economics and the local benefits are changing the politics.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And one reason I’m optimistic is that a lot of this is now mundane economics. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy — nice but pricey. It’s the Costco of energy: cheap, abundant, on the shelf, ready to go.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The federal picture is obviously grim. The EPA under Trump revoked a long-held scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger health and welfare, which is the legal basis for a lot of climate regulation. Is this as bad as it looks? Do you think the courts will stop it?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It will be challenged. We’ll see what happens. But it’s an “up is down” administration. They insist DC is a crime-ridden hellscape when the data say otherwise, and they insist climate’s no big deal as entire neighborhoods burn, as Texas floods, as wildfire smoke becomes a seasonal feature in the East, and as we log the hottest months in recorded history. But physics doesn’t care about press releases. The danger is the damage they can do in the meantime. So we can’t just rely on the superior economics of solar, wind, and batteries. We also need activism to change laws and minds. There’s a lot that states and cities can do — even with Washington hostile.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Give me a concrete example.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rooftop solar in the US costs roughly three times as much, and takes far longer, than in many other countries. In Australia, you can call on Monday and have panels up by Friday; 40 percent of homes there have rooftop solar. The difference isn’t the price of panels; it’s our baroque, Byzantine permitting across 15,000 municipalities. We’re treating a safe, standardized appliance like it’s a bespoke construction project. The National Renewable Energy Lab built an instant-permitting tool — SolarAPP+ — and states like California, Maryland, and New Jersey have adopted it. We should scale that everywhere.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another example is “balcony solar.” In the past two years, millions of Europeans — apartment-dwellers! — have bought a plug-in panel that hangs off the balcony and instantly supplies around 20 percent of a home’s power. That’s illegal across the US, except in Utah, where a libertarian state senator asked the obvious question: Why can Hamburg do it but Provo can’t? The law changed unanimously. Now you can find people in Utah happily plugging in balcony panels and watching the meter spin backward.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why did so many people — including environmentalists — so badly underestimate how fast solar and wind would scale?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For decades, fossil energy was cheap and renewable energy was expensive. That got lodged in our heads. Even climate advocates focused on things like carbon taxes to raise fossil prices so renewables could compete. But about four or five years ago we crossed an invisible line and people didn’t update. Today, it’s often twice as cheap to make power from sun as from fire.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want a date, I’d circle June 2023. That’s when global temperatures began their latest spike. Some of the hottest months in at least 125,000 years, and it’s also the month humanity started installing a gigawatt of solar every day. Since then the pace has only accelerated. In April, China alone was installing around 3 gigawatts per day, which is the equivalent of a coal plant’s capacity every eight hours.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In your book, you note that in 2022, China spent 26 times as much on the clean energy supply chain as Europe and the US combined. The Inflation Reduction Act was starting to narrow that gap. With Trump back, how dramatically will that change? Will we get anywhere close to that expected number or will China just continue to lap us?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ll lap us. The IRA was our best chance to catch up; parts may survive, but a lot won’t. Twenty years from now, the US may be a kind of theme park where tourists come to see how people used to make energy by setting things on fire. Eventually, we’ll try to catch up, but we won’t be owning that future anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I wanted to ask about movement politics since you’ve been so involved for so long. For decades, climate politics was about stopping bad things — pipelines, leases, drilling. But the economics have flipped. The movement now has to be about building. What does that shift look like?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve been writing for a year that people like me — old white guys — should stop reflexively suing to block projects we don’t like. It’s absurd to block solar farms because you don’t like looking at them. The imperative is to make it easier to build the clean stuff. That’s why we’re focused on permitting reform at the local and state level.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Washington is a write-off for the moment; rational thought has left the building. But states — red and blue — can move. Texas and Utah show it. And the appeal is broad. If you’re a “my home is my castle” American, solar makes that literally truer; if you love the idea of a network powered by something elegant and natural, you’re on board for different reasons. Small versus big is the fault line — not left versus right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why did this become a red-blue cultural fight when it really doesn’t have to be?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fossil fuel industry spent decades and billions making it partisan. The Koch network effectively bought one of our political parties. Fifty years ago, environmentalism was bipartisan. [Republican President Richard] Nixon signed the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and created the EPA under pressure from the first Earth Day. The science has been clear since the ’80s, and the oil companies knew. They treated it as a threat to their business model, not to the planet, and were willing to wreck our democracy as well as our atmosphere to defend it. The wild card is that we’ve now introduced the cheapest, most beautiful form of energy into this mix and that changes the politics.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>“Beautiful” isn’t a word people associate with utility-scale power — but you lean into it.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It matters! The sun already gives us light, warmth, and photosynthesis. Now it can power everything else. People respond to that. The Vatican just announced it’s building a solar farm outside Rome that will make the Vatican the first fully solar-powered nation. That’s not just a tech story; it’s a civilizational story. Big Oil is still powerful, but a lot of what they’re pushing — like leaning on countries to lock themselves into US liquefied natural gas — may backfire. If you’re Indonesia or Vietnam, do you really want to tie your future energy supply to a fickle superpower? Or do you want to harvest the sun and wind that fall on your own land and sea?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s a perverse wrinkle here: Sun and wind are so cheap they don’t fit neatly into a profit model built on scarcity.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an investment problem for some incumbents. Returns aren’t as juicy as selling fuel forever. But for countries, cheap power is a competitive advantage. If you can run your industries on electricity, your economy hums. That’s what China is aiming at. Meanwhile, if the US insists on expensive options — coal, gas, or boutique nuclear — we handicap ourselves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You also make the blunt point that breaking the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a big deal if we do want a more humane politics. What’s the argument there?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s liberating in multiple senses. Cut emissions or the planet fries — that’s incentive enough. But we also save lives. About 9 million people die each year from air pollution tied to fossil combustion. We prevent childhood asthma. We reduce the leverage of petro-authoritarians. And we unlock a wave of useful appliances: heat pumps that use a little electricity to move latent heat in the air and keep homes comfortable year-round; EVs and e-bikes that make cities quieter and cleaner.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You really believe there’s hope?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I have hope that it’s worth the try. I can’t think of a better way to spend a life than working on the gravest problem our species has stumbled into.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>On page one you say there’s still a path forward. When is that path foreclosed? How much warming is too much?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Honestly, we don’t know. We’ve never run this experiment with people watching. The last five times the atmosphere filled with carbon — because of massive volcanic eruptions — there were mass extinctions. We’re adding carbon faster now than in those episodes. But unlike volcanoes, our “eruptions” are cars, factories, and power plants we could shut down quickly if we chose. It may be that we’ve already waited too long. The momentum in polar melt and the knock-on effects on jet and Gulf streams are frightening. I’m not a Pollyanna. My first book was called <em>The End of Nature</em>. But for the first time, we have a scalable response. So we should try like hell and hope the Hollywood ending works at least a little.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paint the bleak alternative plainly. If we don’t get this right, what’s the world like in 10, 50, 100 years?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If it’s not hell, it’s close in temperature. Smokier. Harder to grow food. Biology in shock. Extinctions accelerating. At 3 degrees Celsius, the UN estimates 1 to 3 billion climate refugees. That would mean up to a quarter of humanity forced to move. A couple of million people at our southern border nearly broke American politics; now multiply by a thousand. That’s why every tenth of a degree we avoid is the most important political work humans have ever undertaken.</p>

Even though a major hurricane has yet to make landfall this season, 2025 has been a year of devastating floods. Thousands of flash floods across the country this summer sent torrents of water into people’s homes, swept away cars, knocked down trees, and ripped bridges away. Floods over the July 4 weekend in Central Texas [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though a major hurricane has <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/09/the-atlantics-remarkable-20-day-quiet-period-finally-ends/">yet to make landfall</a> this season, 2025 has been a year of devastating floods. Thousands of <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-2025-became-the-summer-of-flash-flooding-in-america-261650">flash floods</a> across the country this summer sent torrents of water into people’s homes, swept away cars, knocked down trees, and <a href="https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-07-10/fm-1431-cow-creek-bridge-lago-vista-marble-falls-sandy-creek-ranches-bridge-flooded-floods-july-fourth-fix">ripped bridges away</a>. Floods over the July 4 weekend in Central Texas <a href="https://www.kut.org/transportation/2025-07-10/fm-1431-cow-creek-bridge-lago-vista-marble-falls-sandy-creek-ranches-bridge-flooded-floods-july-fourth-fix">killed at least 135 people</a> and caused upward of <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/blogs-webinars/texas-flash-flood-tragedy-lives-lost-and-billions-in-damages/1792503">$22 billion in damages</a> according to one estimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Though lost lives can never be recovered, the US has long had a program designed to help surviving homeowners financially devastated by floods. But at a moment when so many are trying to return home and the costs of flood recovery are rising, the National Flood Insurance Program is sinking deeper into the red.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the program borrowed $2 billion from the US Treasury to help cover claims from major storms in 2024 like Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. Even though the program previously had <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN10784">$16 billion in debt</a> forgiven in 2017 — the year <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/28/16362522/hurricane-maria-2017-irma-harvey-rain-flooding-climate-change">Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and Irma</a> struck — NFIP’s total debt is now more than <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN10784">$22.5 billion</a>, and is likely to rise further as claims from floods this year complete processing. And an overwhelmed flood insurance system could be devastating for the homeowners who depend on it — whether they want to or not.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sharon Cozort said that floods were always in the back of her mind when she bought her house in Houston in 2006. “The [500-year] flood plain went right through the middle of our living room,” Cozort said. She and her husband carried flood insurance for about 25 years, paying about $100 to $500 per year, but never needed to use it. Then came Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2017/08/31/harvey-is-a-1000-year-flood-event-unprecedented-in-scale/">one in a thousand-year flood event</a>. It dumped a <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/28/16217626/harvey-houston-flood-water-visualized">gargantuan amount of water</a> on Houston and forced the reservoir system to release water to avoid overflowing out of control, which then flooded Cozort’s house for a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">She thought about relocating to a neighborhood outside the flood zone, or out of the city entirely. But the existence of government flood insurance made coming back the most financially viable option, if not the most comfortable one.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“My husband dragged me back to Houston kicking and screaming,” Cozort said. “The whole town was calling each other, ‘What are you going to do? Are you going to repair? Are you going to rebuild? Are you going to elevate?’ It was kind of a mass panic.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cozort is clear-eyed about the risks she faces and knows that the flood insurance system, as it stands, is unsustainable. It’s just that there aren’t any practical alternatives for her and her husband, who are hoping to use their home’s equity to retire and invest. For individual homeowners, there isn’t much they can do on their own to reduce the systemic flood risk for their cities, or to change the structure of flood insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the other parts of the country she was considering are facing their own mounting insurance costs from <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377094/hurricane-milton-helene-home-insurance-flooding-damage">severe weather</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/397756/la-wildfire-insurance-palisades-california-fair-plan-climate">wildfires</a>. “This house will flood again,” Cozort said. “This is a new world.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And indeed, we are living in a new world. Flooding is the <a href="https://www.iii.org/article/spotlight-on-flood-insurance">most frequent and most expensive</a> disaster in the US. More Americans are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acadf5">living in areas prone to flooding</a>, even as property values are increasing and construction costs are rising, making it more expensive to rebuild after a disaster. And due to how humanity has altered the landscape and warmed the climate, the devastation of inundation is growing. “The baseline is that flood risk is definitely increasing,” said <a href="https://www.edf.org/people/carolyn-kousky">Carolyn Kousky</a>, an insurance expert at the Environmental Defense Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The current national flood insurance system was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44593">founded in 1968</a>. Today, the federal program has <a href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance">4.7 million policyholders</a> and provides $1.3 trillion in flood coverage. Unlike other perils such as fire and earthquakes, there are few private companies willing to insure properties against floods. For the vast majority of homeowners, NFIP is the only game in town, or the only plan within their budget. The program is funded through short-term authorizations from Congress. The program is currently authorized <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44593">until September 30, 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/GettyImages-2174887967.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Flood waters inundate a main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida, after Hurricane Helene passed offshore on September 27, 2024." title="Flood waters inundate a main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida, after Hurricane Helene passed offshore on September 27, 2024." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Flood waters inundate a main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida, after Hurricane Helene passed offshore on September 27, 2024.&lt;/p&gt; | Joe Raedle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Joe Raedle/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge for the NFIP is that it’s boxed in by mandates set by Congress that make it almost impossible for it to balance its books. NFIP must make flood insurance available to homeowners in areas that face flood risks, and it has to keep rates affordable, even as risks increase. “The tension between widespread access and being fiscally sound has been there since the beginning,” Kousky said. The federal program can’t simply jack up its prices or cut off its riskiest customers the way private companies do. It’s a crude, blunt tool for mitigating an expansive, evolving, and complicated problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And in many ways, the program makes the problems it&#8217;s trying to solve worse, creating a moral hazard that can encourage people to remain in flood-prone areas because they know the federal government is picking up most of the tab after a flood. “There are areas where we’re spending more to rebuild than the properties are worth,” Kousky said. These costs are shouldered by all of us, whether we’re in a flood zone or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But even with broad agreement that the current situation is untenable, the nation’s flood insurance is stuck in place. The Trump administration has also been slowing efforts to <a href="https://undark.org/2025/08/19/flood-map-reform-trump/">redraw maps of floodplains</a> to better account for evolving risks. President Donald Trump said he was considering <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/politics/fema-hurricane-season-phase-out-trump">closing the Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA), which manages NFIP, leaving its future less certain. And there are signs that the administration of the program itself is shaky: Homeowners like Cozort have also reported recent hiccups in accessing NFIP’s website and communicating with the program this year, leaving them worried that their coverage may have lapsed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the growing threat from floods will force a difficult political reckoning over who gets to live where and how much the rest of us should pay to protect them.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our federal flood insurance system is its own disaster</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The business model of a private insurance company is straightforward: take in more money in premiums than it pays out. However, the math of figuring out just how much to charge gets complicated fast, demanding a sophisticated understanding of hazards, exposure, economics, and human psychology.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Floods are especially difficult to insure because the damages are highly correlated. A house fire may destroy or damage several homes on a block, but a torrential downpour can flood thousands of properties at the same time. Fulfilling all those claims at once can overwhelm even a large insurance company.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another issue is that the homeowners who most expect to see floods are the ones most inclined to buy flood insurance, while those on higher ground or outside of designated flood zones often don’t. That means the pool of properties covered by flood insurance is much riskier than the housing market as a whole, a phenomenon known as adverse selection.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Faced with these circumstances, most private property insurance companies decided the best bet was not to be in the business of providing flood insurance at all. But there are still tens of millions of people who live close to the coast or in places where rivers can swell. About <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/economics-and-demographics.html">40 percent of the US population</a> lives in a coastal county, accounting for just over <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy">one-third of the country’s economic output</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Between 1970 and 2020, the coastal US population has increased <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/states/fast-facts/economics-and-demographics.html">by 40.5 million people</a>. Most banks require homes in known flood risk areas to have flood insurance in order to get a mortgage. Add to that the millions who live alongside inland rivers, low-lying farms, and valleys where the natural geography shunts water toward towns, and you have a huge portion of the US population and economy facing some type of flood risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government stepped in to help manage some of these risks with NFIP. The goal over time was to spend <em>less</em> on disaster recovery by encouraging people and communities to invest in flood protection — things like levees and drainage systems — or to relocate to lower-risk areas.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But that hasn’t really happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply assessing the risks accurately as they stand today is an arduous task. The main benchmark the federal program uses is the 100-year flood zone, the regions of the US where a major flood is expected at least once every 100 years. Put another way, these are the places where there’s a 1 percent chance of a major flood in any given year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is that flood risks change over time. As we’ve built new housing developments, for example, we’ve cleared landscapes and put down more pavement, and that alters where water flows. Because of climate change, sea levels are rising, leading to more extensive coastal flooding. Hotter air can also hold onto more moisture, so severe rainfall events are pouring out more rain, increasing the intensity of flooding in some areas, including outside of tropical storms. But climate change is complex. Other parts of the country are drying out and seeing a drop in flood risk and decline in flood insurance rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition, homeowners aren’t keen to find out their house is now suddenly in a flood zone, which means they may have to buy flood insurance, their property value could drop, and if they want to sell, it could be difficult to find a buyer. That’s why some property developers have <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2012/06/colbert-spoofs-north-carolina-on-sea-level-rise-legislation/">lobbied to change federal and state flood risk assessments</a> to downplay the dangers to their real estate. On the other hand, FEMA has long been criticized for using <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/joel-scata/femas-outdated-and-backward-looking-flood-maps">outdated flood maps</a>, let alone anticipating future changes in the climate. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In an attempt to resolve some of these tensions, NFIP in 2022 implemented <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN11777">Risk Rating 2.0</a>, the biggest revisions to its flood mapping and risk calculations since the program was founded. While it brought flood risk assessments closer to the real world, the changes made flood insurance premiums for many homeowners more expensive, leading <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/hundreds-of-thousands-drop-flood-insurance-as-rates-rise/">hundreds of thousands to drop their coverage</a> entirely. Already, some lawmakers are calling for <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/23/cassidy-calls-an-end-risk-rating-20-amid-rising-flood-insurance-premiums/">Risk Rating 2.0 to be repealed</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even with this revised methodology, many observers say NFIP doesn’t adequately measure flood risks as they exist today. “We’re definitely seeing more and more flooding in places where we didn’t expect to see it,” said Jeremy Porter, chief economist at First Street, a climate risk modeling group. Porter told Vox that First Street found there are more than twice as many properties in the 100-year flood risk zone than FEMA shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And just because a home or business is outside of a known flood zone doesn’t mean it will never flood. <a href="https://www.terry.uga.edu/directory/marc-ragin/">Marc Ragin</a>, an associate professor in the Department of Insurance, Legal Studies, and Real Estate at the University of Georgia, studied how flood maps can create a false sense of security. “We did a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/financing-negative-shocks-evidence-from-hurricane-harvey/CB196DE16C10A6758A73C8BE7B2FAF6A">survey of small businesses</a> in Houston after Hurricane Harvey. We flew down there and met with probably 20-25 business owners,” Ragin said. “In every conversation, we would ask them, ‘Did you have flood insurance?’ And almost every one of them said, ‘No.’ And we would say, ‘Why not?’ And they would say, ‘Well, I&#8217;m not in a flood zone.’”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How NFIP prices these risks poses another problem. While the price of insurance normally serves as a clear signal of risk — higher risk, higher premiums —&nbsp; a subsidized rate from the federal government’s program masks that signal.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of NFIP, providing insurance policies at below-market rates reduces the incentive for people who live in risky areas to move out of flood zones, and may even do the opposite. <a href="https://www.jon-sc.in/">Jonathan Scott</a>, an assistant professor at the Jindal School of Management at the University of Texas Dallas, coauthored <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/726155">a paper last year</a> that found that NFIP was actually encouraging <em>more</em> people to move to high-risk areas for flooding. “We&#8217;re looking at this moral hazard where if risk is priced below the actuarially fair level, it&#8217;s going to encourage an inefficient level of migration to these locations because consumers are essentially getting a bargain on this,” Scott said. “A lot of these properties were getting charged like $500 premiums when they should have been something closer to like $5,000, $10,000, or something like that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first step is to have a blunt, realistic assessment of the risks, particularly those exacerbated by climate change. “I would anticipate a continuing pattern of worsening storm damage from rainfall, flooding events, and also from hurricane and tropical storm events,” said <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jim-blackburn">Jim Blackburn</a>, a professor in the civil engineering department at Rice University in Houston studying severe storms and floods. “I don’t think we’ve been honest about these facts about our changing risk profile.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting people to take flood risks seriously, even in areas that have seen extensive floods in recent memory, has been difficult. In 2011, after Hurricane Ike, the Houston suburb of Clear Lake <a href="https://abc13.com/archive/7946821/">installed signs around town</a> showing that storm surge could reach as high as 20 feet. But residents complained that the signs were hurting property values and they were soon taken down. Houston itself has built up <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/2025/houston-metro-floodplain-construction/">thousands more properties</a> in flood-prone areas since Harvey. The local flood control district is <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/old-fema-map-harris-county-hurricane-harvey-20771294.php">still using old flood maps</a> that predate the damage revealed from the storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The next step is to act on these risk assessments. The Environmental Defense Fund’s Kousky said FEMA could restore and enhance grant programs that help communities mitigate risks, like restoring watersheds and building levees. Federal, state, and local governments also need to put more money toward adaptation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also important to remember insured losses don’t tell the whole story. Increasingly, Americans are facing greater flood risks in places that lack any financial protection. A 2024 working paper from the <a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2024/wp24-23.pdf">Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia</a> found that 70 percent of property losses to floods are uninsured, totaling $17.1 billion in damages. Even for those who are insured, as flood policies get more expensive, more homeowners are <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/hundreds-of-thousands-drop-flood-insurance-as-rates-rise/">letting their coverage lapse</a>, and the total damage from floods is far outpacing what’s covered by insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-17-at-10.08.53%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The total cost of flood damages far exceeds what’s covered by insurance. | Federal Reserve Bank of New York" data-portal-copyright="Federal Reserve Bank of New York" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And flood insurance loss tallies mainly capture homeowners, not renters. Apartment dwellers also get displaced during floods, but don’t get as much help in relocating or returning after a disaster.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth rethinking the role of NFIP. It may never work as a business proposition, and there’s no way around the core fact that losses from floods are growing. If NFIP charges for its policies in line with the risk, few people would be able to afford them. And if they continue to subsidize rates, homeowners will continue to live in risky areas, damages will continue to rise, and the program will keep losing money.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Should it be viewed as a public service, like the Marine Corps or the Postal Office, something that serves a purpose but is not designed to turn a profit? In that case, we may just have to let NFIP again slide on the money it owes the Treasury.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The real challenge is for states and local governments to say no to new buildings and pulling people back from existing structures in high-risk areas. In places like Florida and Texas that don’t have income taxes, the states get much of their money from property taxes, which gives state lawmakers an incentive to encourage more property development, particularly in high-value areas like riverfronts and coasts. “If you think about these communities just in terms of economic incentives, the tax revenue that they&#8217;re going to get from this high-value home that&#8217;s got this beautiful view of the water, that&#8217;s a big boon to the community,” said University of Georgia’s Ragin.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There needs to be a strong message from policymakers that building in a floodplain is dangerous. That’s not just a signal from insurance companies, but from policymakers to actively discourage and relocate people. “In my opinion, federal, state, and local policies need to be to move people out of the floodplain over time,” Blackburn said. “These areas are only going to get more and more water.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A home is often the single most expensive thing anyone buys, and people spend years paying it off. Getting people to adapt or retreat will be a slow process, even as disaster losses continue to mount. “You have to do that in a gradual manner,” said Scott at the University of Texas Dallas. “It could take decades.” In the meantime, America’s main financial tool for dealing with floods will plummet even further underwater.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a person firmly ensconced in middle age — 57 percent of the way through life, to be precise, if <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">government actuarial tables hold</a> — I have begun to notice certain things not working quite as well as they used to. Specifically, my eyes and my ears.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can ask my family: My hearing is not what it once was, and not just because I have been known to hear selectively from time to time. As for my eyes, I had them zapped with lasers back in 2005, but the increasing squint as I read tells me the warranty may have expired on that. And I’m not alone — about 14 percent of Americans between 45 and 64 <a href="https://heardothan.com/hearing-resources/facts-about-hearing-loss/" data-type="link" data-id="https://heardothan.com/hearing-resources/facts-about-hearing-loss/">experience</a> hearing loss in some way,<strong> </strong>while over 90 percent of those over 45 <a href="https://www.aoa.org/news/clinical-eye-care/diseases-and-conditions/for-128-million-us-presbyopes-doctors-of-optometry-can-provide-treatment-options?utm_source=chatgpt.com">suffer from presbyopia</a>, or the declining ability to focus on near objects. Globally, the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss?utm_source=chatgpt.com">projects</a> that by 2050 nearly 2.5 billion people will have some form of hearing loss.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But I have good news for fellow aging people (which is, well, all of us eventually.) Our digital gadgets are increasingly being designed with features that can help users overcome both the usual sensory declines of age and more severe disabilities and diseases. From Apple AirPods that can act as <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/?afid=p240%7Cgo~cmp-22996441833~adg-190367116732~ad-774766374133_kwd-756942568996~dev-c~ext-~prd-~mca-~nt-search&amp;cid=wwa-us-kwgo-airpods-noncore_p3-airpodspro3_hearinghealth-airpodspro3_hearinghealth_091925-AirPodsPro3-AirPodsPro3-Hearinghealth-airpods+hearing+aids">inexpensive hearing aids</a> — and now, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/personaltech/new-airpods-language-translation-feature.html">on-the-go translators</a> — to the growing ubiquity of <a href="https://news.med.miami.edu/how-continuous-glucose-monitors-are-changing-diabetes-care/">continuous glucose monitors</a> for diabetics, some of the most promising uses of consumer tech involve propping up our failing organic meat-sacks.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Can you hear me now?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest consumer tech nudge from “nice to have” toward “health tool” happened last year: the US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software?utm_source=chatgpt.com">authorized</a> the first over-the-counter hearing-aid software. It’s called “Hearing Aid Feature,” and it allows adults with mild to moderate hearing loss to use compatible AirPods as OTC hearing aids. Given that even over-the-counter hearing aids <a href="https://audiologists.org/resources/hearing-wellness/how-much-are-hearing-aids?utm_source=chatgpt.com">can run from several hundred dollars to over $1,000</a>, a roughly $200<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3">pair of AirPod Pro 2s</a> can feel like a bargain. For more complex hearing loss, the audiologist still matters, but the FDA’s endorsement lowers stigma and price barriers for millions who won’t (or can’t) get clinical devices. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And those same buds now speak multiple languages. Apple’s new <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/airpods/translate-in-person-conversations-dev9c215ca94/web">Live Translation</a>, part of this fall’s “Apple Intelligence” rollout, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/technology/personaltech/new-airpods-language-translation-feature.html">pipes two-way conversation translation</a> straight through your AirPods when paired to an iPhone. In demos and early reviews it’s already proven good enough for everyday use, translating in English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish, with more languages promised. For anyone who’s ever tried to navigate a medical form, a parent-teacher conference, or a pharmacy pickup in a second language, this is less a party trick and more a social ramp.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Public places are catching up, too. Auracast — Bluetooth’s broadcast audio standard — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/628533/android-16-auracast-hearing-aid-support?utm_source=chatgpt.com">turns loud, crowded public venues</a> into accessible listening zones. Instead of borrowing sticky headsets at a theater, you can join a labeled audio stream with your own earbuds or hearing aids. Google has baked Auracast support into Android 16, and Pixel phones are starting to make “join broadcast” feel as normal as hopping on wifi. That’s dignity, not just decibels.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Visionary</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our eyes are, if anything, almost as bad as our ears: at least 2.2 billion people around the world <a href="https://www.who.int/Publications/i/Item/9789241516570?utm_source=chatgpt.com">have some form of vision impairment</a>. And our addiction to digital devices is actively making that worse: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830598">Studies have found</a> that a daily 1-hour increment of digital screen time is associated with 21 percent higher odds of myopia, or nearsightedness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if phones are the cause of at least some of our vision problems, they have added features that can help people with vision impairment navigate the world. On the iPhone, the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph35c335575/ios?utm_source=chatgpt.com">built-in Magnifier app</a> harnesses the device’s camera to do some beautifully practical things; Door Detection announces a door’s distance and how it opens; Point and Speak reads the labels on physical buttons when you aim your finger, decoding all too often inscrutable kiosks. And while automatic translation requires iPhones advanced (and expensive) enough to use Apple Intelligence, these are stock features, not add-ons.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over on Android, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-december-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Google’s Lookout app</a> now goes beyond “what’s in this picture?” to truly useful follow-ups for the vision impaired. Image Q&amp;A lets you ask for details about an image and get spoken, more helpful answers, and Google says those descriptions are now powered by its newer Gemini AI models. That translates to daily autonomy: “Is this the blue shirt?” “What does the sign say?” “Where’s the submit button?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s my number?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The consumer-to-care transition is happening in chronic disease, too. Continuous glucose monitors — medical implants that track glucose levels — have been available for diagnosed diabetics for some time. But in 2024, the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cleared</a> the first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor, Dexcom’s Stelo, for adults who don’t use insulin (which includes diabetics who control their illness with oral medication and people who may be pre-diabetic). A few months later, the medical devices company Abbott <a href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2024-06-10-Abbott-Receives-U-S-FDA-Clearance-for-Two-New-Over-the-Counter-Continuous-Glucose-Monitoring-Systems">won clearance</a> for two over-the-counter sensors: Libre Rio (specifically for adults with type 2 diabetes not using insulin) and Lingo (which is aimed more at the wellness crowd).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">No prescription needed; just a phone and a sensor. For the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html">38 million Americans with diabetes</a> — and the much larger group with pre-diabetes — that makes it simple to see how breakfast or a walk affects your glucose curve. Just remember that data is not a diagnosis.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Assisted living</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These new technologies don’t just represent more convenience —&nbsp;they could literally make people healthier. Take hearing assistance: A landmark NIH-funded randomized trial <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/hearing-aids-slow-cognitive-decline-people-high-risk?utm_source=chatgpt.com">found that in older adults</a> at higher risk, treating hearing loss slowed cognitive decline over three years. That doesn’t turn earbuds into dementia shields, but it does show the value of removing hurdles to hearing support. The same is true for diabetes, which requires lifelong management. Anything that makes that easier can help improve lives.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Progress is when people no longer need expensive specialty devices; they can get the same benefits from the polished, affordable things they already own. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or low-vision, managing conditions like diabetes, or just getting up there in years like me, that rewiring adds up to something radical: more agency with less hassle.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now if only someone could design an implant that would instantly locate my remote control.</p>

There is a deep human impulse to whittle reality down into familiar and self-flattering fairy tales.

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a deep human impulse to whittle reality down into familiar and self-flattering fairy tales.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We all gravitate toward information that validates our preconceptions and vindicates our in-groups. It is cognitively taxing to revise one’s model of the world. And it is emotionally uncomfortable to recognize fault in our allies or merit in our adversaries. So, we are all tempted to sand the jagged edges off events until they fit into ideologically convenient frames.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If this impulse is universal, however, liberals (such as myself) like to believe that we are less vulnerable to it. After all, we are the side that favors scientific inquiry over religious fundamentalism, universalism over ethnocentrism, and critical accounts of American history over jingoistic ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives, by contrast, often recoil at moral complexity. And their leadership is unbound by any sense of fealty to the truth. Or so the progressive historian <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-13-2025">Heather Cox Richardson suggested</a>, in a recent Substack post.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Richardson’s account, McCarthyism taught the American right the political utility of shameless lies. By crafting mendacious and simplistic “us” versus “them” narratives — and repeating them ceaselessly — conservatives found that they could “construct a fictional world,” which many voters would unknowingly come to inhabit. Liberals in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html">reality-based community</a>” — to use a phrase made famous by the George W. Bush administration — might feel compelled to align their claims with discernible facts. But the American right, feels no such obligation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As an example of conservatives’ mendacity, Richardson cites the Trump administration’s attempt to pin Charlie Kirk’s assassination on the left. And not without reason: The White House’s brazenly dishonest propaganda about that tragedy does much to support Richardson’s portrait of the right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, shortly after decrying the GOP’s privileging of “narrative” over “facts,” Richardson wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">[I]n fact, the alleged shooter was not someone on the left. The alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, is a young white man from a Republican, gun enthusiast family, who appears to have embraced the far right, disliking Kirk for being insufficiently radical. Rather than grappling with reality, right-wing figures are using Kirk’s murder to prop up their fictional world. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Richardson’s post in fact deftly illustrates the hazards of tribalistic thinking and epistemic immodesty, just not quite in the manner that it intended.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When Richardson published her column on September 13, there was no sound basis for asserting that Robinson was “not someone on the left,” much less that he was a far-right extremist who’d killed Kirk for being inadequately reactionary. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">charging documents</a> released Tuesday indicate that Richardson’s narrative was false.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, that narrative was briefly pervasive within social media’s left-wing corners. In fact, the idea that Robinson was a proven reactionary became so widespread among liberals that ABC’s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (apparently) felt safe <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">paying it lip service</a> on Monday.  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even after Tuesday’s revelations, a few left-wing influencers continued promoting <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/confronting-a-fuller-picture-of-charlie-kirks-killer-tyler-robinson-political-violence">the idea that Robinson opposed Kirk</a> from the right, explaining away evidence to the contrary with conspiracy theories.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The left’s embrace of comforting fictions about Kirk’s assassination is understandable. But it is also irresponsible and politically self-defeating. To truly inhabit the “reality-based community,” progressives must not merely spotlight the right’s fantasies, but stand more watchful guard against our own. </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What we know about Tyler Robinson’s motive</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, authorities in Utah filed charges against Tyler Robinson for aggravated murder. Three pieces of evidence in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/09/16/us/tyler-robinson-charges.html">indictment suggest</a> that Robinson objected to Kirk’s politics from the left:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Robinson’s mother told investigators that her son “had become more political and had started to lean more to the left — becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.” His mother also said that he had begun “to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders.”</li>
<li>Robinson had texted a confession to his roommate after the shooting, referring to the roommate as “my love” and saying of Kirk, “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.”</li>
<li>Robinson’s parents told investigators that he had explained his crime to them in similar terms, saying that Kirk “spreads too much hate.”</li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The indictment is not the last word on Robinson’s motivations (or, for that matter, his guilt). But nothing in the assembled evidence supports the narrative that Robinson was far-right.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How many progressives came to believe that Robinson was a “groyper”</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It isn’t hard to understand why progressives found it plausible that Robinson was a reactionary extremist. The alleged killer engraved his bullet casings with references to a bizarre array of memes, including one that <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme">mocks so-called furries</a> (adults who dress up in animal costumes during sexual encounters), and another that informed observers, “If you read this, you are gay LMAO.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These etchings recalled the nihilistic, anti-LGBT trolling often found on the extremely online right. And Charlie Kirk had his reactionary enemies: The white nationalist podcaster Nick Fuentes’s fandom — a community known as “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/15/groyper-charlie-kirk-nick-fuentes-tyler-robinson">groypers</a>” — had declared <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/a-groyper-war-struggles-to-exert-influence-but-paves-the-way-for-other-bad-actors/">a war</a> on Kirk’s organization, Turning Point USA, for failing to uphold Fuentes’s explicitly racist vision of America First.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From the beginning, there were reasons to doubt that Robinson was a rightist. Most obviously, Kirk earned far more enmity from the left than the right. And one of Robinson’s bullet casings read, “Hey, fascist! Catch” (though, this could be dismissed as <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/charlie-kirk-was-killed-by-a-meme">an arbitrary video game reference</a>).</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The moment we deem ourselves immune to ideological chauvinism and unreason, we become more vulnerable to both.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Given this initial collection of facts, progressives had cause for <em>entertaining</em> the idea that Robinson was a white nationalist, but none for asserting it as an established fact.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the “groyper” theory lacked a solid factual basis, however, it offered considerable psychological appeal. It is uncomfortable to accept that you share a worldview — or even, a few strong moral convictions — with perpetrators of terrible crimes. To avoid such discomfort, people often latch onto improbable narratives. To absolve MAGA of January 6’s mayhem, many conservatives embraced the theory that the riot was orchestrated by <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/conspiracy-theories-paint-fraudulent-reality-of-jan-6-riot">antifa</a> (and/or the FBI). To avoid grappling with atrocities committed in the name of a cause they supported, some on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/">far-left</a> decided that the October 7 attacks were a false-flag operation. To deny Israel’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461977/un-commission-report-israel-genocide-gaza">inhuman crimes</a> against the people of Gaza, its defenders tell <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/coleman-hughes-the-simple-truth-about">themselves stories</a> that attribute all culpability for the Jewish state’s violence to its enemies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think some progressives’ misplaced confidence in Robinson’s conservatism was rooted in a similar impulse (which is not to say that hasty assumptions about a killer’s motives are <em>morally</em> comparable to apologetics for genocidal violence). And the psychic appeal of the “groyper” theory enabled it to become common sense among substantial portion of progressives, such that the writers of <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> evidently felt comfortable insinuating that Robinson was a conservative.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump wants to have a fight about Robinson’s motive</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of Tuesday’s indictment, many progressives have abandoned the notion that Kirk was killed for being insufficiently racist (on Wednesday, Richardson <a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-16-2025">retreated to the claim</a> that Robinson’s motive “remains unclear”). </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But a few on the left have tried to <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/confronting-a-fuller-picture-of-charlie-kirks-killer-tyler-robinson-political-violence">salvage</a> the “groyper” theory, in part by <a href="https://x.com/JoJoFromJerz/status/1968137869765365879">questioning the authenticity of Robinson’s text exchanges</a> with his roommate. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Such conspiracism is not just intellectually bankrupt, but politically self-defeating.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration wants to use Kirk’s killing as an excuse for cracking down on progressive dissent. Its argument for that assault on free expression includes one apparent truth (that Kirk’s killer shared some of the left’s objections to his work) and a whole host of claims that are either blatantly false or wholly unproven (that Robinson was affiliated with progressive organizations, that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461314/charlie-kirk-death-trump-political-violence-source">political violence in America</a> comes exclusively from the left, that the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">Federal Communications Commission</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462012/kimmel-suspension-trump-fcc-kirk-free-speech">has the legal authority</a> to police the offhanded remarks of comedians). </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It is therefore in the administration’s interest to focus public debate on Robinson’s apparent motive. That is the subject they <em>want</em> to fight about — which is why they tried to get <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar">Jimmy Kimmel fired</a> for his misguided intervention into that argument.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives must not get baited into a losing fight. We don’t need to deny the facts about Kirk’s killing to refute the administration’s broader narrative about that tragedy. Whatever Robinson’s motive, the left is responsible for <a href="https://www.alexnowrasteh.com/p/deadly-politically-motivated-violence">a small minority</a> of political violence in the United States in recent decades. And there is no evidence that Kirk’s alleged killer belonged to any organized progressive group, much less that his violence was directly abetted by the liberal foundations that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/vance-white-house-promise-to-crack-down-on-radical-left-lunatics-00564766">has promised to destroy</a>. On every point that actually has bearing on the policy response to Kirk’s death, the facts are on progressives’ side. We should focus on those realities. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More broadly, liberals must strive to avoid further lapses of epistemic humility in the future. In my view, the broad left is correct to believe that it has more respect for empirical truth — and comfort with moral ambiguity — than the right does. But this advantage is strictly relative. And the moment we deem ourselves immune to ideological chauvinism and unreason, we become more vulnerable to both.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kash Patel has had a long week.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The FBI director and frequent social media poster faced scrutiny for how he handled the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation, including from members of his own party. Conservative <a href="https://x.com/realchrisrufo/status/1966520299723366534">activist Chris Rufo posted on X</a>: “We would be wise to take a moment and ask whether Kash Patel has what it takes to get this done.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before he was President Donald Trump’s pick for FBI director, Patel was a lawyer and national security aide in Trump’s first term. Not only that, but he was a MAGA golden child, reported conspiracy theorist, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjWCnh42Sc4">big-time critic of the FBI</a>, wanting the headquarters shut down on day one, and reopened “the next day as a museum of the deep state.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Patel had several stumbles early on in the Kirk investigation, <a href="https://x.com/FBIDirectorKash/status/1965903392934633587">posting on X</a> that the FBI had someone in custody, only for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-director-kash-patel-faces-scrutiny-inaccurately-saying-kirk-killer-had-been-2025-09-11/">officials in Utah to announce</a>, around the same time, that they were still looking for the suspect. He was then called to Capitol Hill to testify in front of the Senate and the House, where he spent two days <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/16/g-s1-88926/fbi-director-patel-testimony-congress">being grilled by lawmakers</a> about the Epstein files, among other things.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To make sense of Patel’s recent blunders — and why Trump is backing him anyway — <em>Today, Explained</em>’s Sean Rameswaram talked to Axios White House reporter <a href="https://www.axios.com/authors/mcaputo">Marc Caputo</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. Listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trumps-chief-culture-warrior/id1346207297?i=1000725937911">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://pandora.app.link/jgYqd4gxyWb">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5oPbXLokOOJp6SmihchBtz?si=786ca5a143a94e34">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We&#8217;ve come to you today to ask you how happy the Republicans are with the job Kash Patel is doing. Clearly, Democrats on Capitol Hill, not very happy. How about Republicans?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The most prominent voice online criticizing Kash Patel&#8217;s performance was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5iFYziMiT1o">Chris Rufo</a>. Rufo had, like a lot of people, just really disliked the performative nature of Patel online. And there are a few other conservatives in the administration who shared the belief. They just think that Patel is a little too much on Twitter or on X or on social media and sort of not more of your traditional hang-back, don&#8217;t-say-too-much FBI director.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What do they want to see Kash Patel doing as director of the FBI?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just catching more bad guys. The big thing that is animating the right broadly is the idea that there are a number of leftist groups and organizations who are funneling money to violent, disruptive protests and illegal activity. And those need to be investigated, busted up, and the perpetrators of these alleged crimes brought to justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are those who believe that the FBI has too many deep staters and more firings need to happen. What just happened prior to the murder of Charlie Kirk, there was a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/10/g-s1-87947/fbi-lawsuit-firing-retribution">lawsuit</a> filed by three former FBI agents who alleged that their firing was illegal and unlawful [that] portrayed Kash Patel as sort of bumbling in his job and not knowing what he&#8217;s doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s the sort of downside of the mass firings. The upside of the mass firings is that is what the conservative MAGA base wants. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, had sort of leapt to the fore with that. She got in office and dismissed a lot of people. Kash Patel hasn&#8217;t done as many firings, and in the MAGA mind, that has been a mistake.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A lot of people were worried that Trump was going to remake the FBI in his image, and that of course would be an image of not only a president, but a convicted felon. Has Kash Patel yet accomplished that or is that still to come or is it unclear?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oh no, I think a lot of these agencies, bureaus, whatever you want to call them, they have career service employees who are harder to fire, harder to dismiss. They have their own culture, history, and institutions, and perhaps none as storied and as solid as the FBI. The ability to really change that is going to be difficult. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not happening, but I know that people in Patel&#8217;s orbit have bemoaned how difficult it is to change things. One of them told me it&#8217;s like an asylum over here. So the “deep state” — I&#8217;m putting that in air quotes — is still resisting the Trump attempt to take over.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So it sounds like Kash Patel has lots of static with various people in this administration, with various people in the base. Does he have allies?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the people who wanted Kash Patel to become FBI director was Charlie Kirk. He advocated for him. Kirk had a very close relationship with Donald Trump, was very involved in the transition. Really, the closest person to Patel is Rick Grinnell, who was an ambassador and then the acting director of national intelligence during Trump&#8217;s first term, who is now a special envoy, including to Venezuela. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He and Kash Patel have a very close and good relationship. That was probably the closest thing to his upper-level sponsor. I understand from one source that Trump [last week]<strong> </strong>went golfing with Kash Patel and a Newsmax personality. So there was sort of a bonding moment there on the links with the president, and from what I&#8217;m told, all went well.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And of course, it&#8217;s only that person at the top who matters in this administration. How&#8217;s Trump feeling about Kash Patel, in light of recent events in Utah, the hearings on Capitol Hill this week?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump likes a winner, and in Trump&#8217;s mind, they got the guy [who killed Charlie Kirk]. Kash Patel has made a good argument as to him owning a share of the responsibility or being able to claim credit for catching the suspect by releasing his photo early. And one of the things that you&#8217;ll look at and notice in conservative or right-wing press is a very clear and very smart campaign by Kash Patel and the various people at the FBI and his orbit to make sure that he&#8217;s getting credit for that. And who reads conservative media, conservative publications, and pays attention to conservative influencers? Donald Trump!</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Kash Patel doing that Donald Trump likes? It certainly can&#8217;t just be that he raised his voice a bunch of times at Adam Schiff and Cory Booker this week on Capitol Hill.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump likes his people engaged and active in the fight. When [New Jersey Democratic Sen.] Cory Booker comes out there and says, “Oh, you&#8217;re not going to be here much longer. You’re gonna get fired.” When Donald Trump hears something like that, “Oh, Cory Booker thinks he should go. Well, I guess I&#8217;m going to keep him.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then secondly, when Patel and Booker went at it, and there was a sort of shouting match and going back and forth, and he held his own. &#8230; Donald Trump likes that stuff. He wants people engaged in the fighting; he wants them to mix it up. He wants them to go after Democrats, counterpunch, and hit hard. And Kash Patel does that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jimmy Kimmel wasn’t suspended because of poor ratings. He wasn’t suspended because he crossed some ethical red line. He was suspended because the president of the United States decided to make an example of him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The supposed justification came on Kimmel’s Monday night show. “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said in his monologue. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There was little evidence at the time to think the shooter was a MAGA supporter, as Kimmel’s comment seemed to imply, and nothing we’ve learned since suggests otherwise. If anything, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/14/us/kirk-shooting-suspect-ideology-partner.html">evidence points in the opposite direction</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But democracies are supposed to absorb careless speech. Bad jokes, bad takes, even vile remarks are the price of a free society. And the whole point of the First Amendment is to take the government out of the business of deciding what we can and can’t hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461887/jimmy-kimmel-suspension-air-abc-charlie-kirk-nexstar?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjhoMGxra29nNmkiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGl0aWNzLzQ2MTg4Ny9qaW1teS1raW1tZWwtc3VzcGVuc2lvbi1haXItYWJjLWNoYXJsaWUta2lyay1uZXhzdGFyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzU5MzczNTQzLCJpYXQiOjE3NTgxNjM5NDN9.YM3GMYWJWySd9trlimPmYwiNoO-8KQ_Sth7eMJ9pICM&amp;utm_medium=gift-link&amp;utm_source=sailthru&amp;utm_campaign=SSSCOTUSTrumpsTeam&amp;ueid=10b3a670165430d31fdd98f5af631883&amp;utm_term=Highly%20engaged%20non-contribs">Zack Beauchamp</a> argued, Kimmel’s suspension represents a remarkably brazen attack on free speech. And if it succeeds in setting the precedent that presidents can use regulators to muzzle their enemies, we’re in a political emergency. Because free expression is more than a democratic value. It’s the foundation that makes every other value possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But none of what’s happening should surprise us. The same openness that allows dissent and satire is also what makes democratic societies vulnerable to demagogues who can exploit them — what my co-author Zac Gershberg and I called in our book on the subject the “<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo146792768.html">paradox of democracy</a>.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So there will always be moments when a culture that prides itself on tolerating every kind of speech will eventually have to decide whether it also tolerates efforts to silence speech. This is one of those moments.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How democratic spaces can give way to antidemocratic forces</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What we’re seeing in the Kimmel case has precedents that go all the way back to the dawn of democracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Athens, the open legal forum that allowed Socrates to question authority also gave his enemies the power to put him on trial for “corrupting the youth.” The very openness that made debate possible also created the space for repressive forces to weaponize the system against him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In Weimar Germany, the explosion of film, radio, and print paved the way for new art and progressive ideas, but those same media were quickly turned into tools of mass propaganda by Joseph Goebbels, drowning democratic culture in authoritarian messaging.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US today, the regulatory framework designed to safeguard open broadcasting is being wielded to punish a critic of the president. And more broadly, the same wide-open information environment that underpins free expression has made it possible for MAGA and its allies to increasingly dominate the public square — amplifying conspiracy theories, overwhelming fact-based journalism, and eroding the very conditions for shared reality.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Steve Bannon openly bragged about “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">flooding the zone with shit</a>,” exploiting the sheer volume of the open information environment to break the press. President Donald Trump’s continual <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/26/13417532/donald-trump-lies">torrent of lies</a> works the same way. And hostile actors abroad — from <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/12/17/18145075/russia-facebook-twitter-internet-research-agency-race">Russia’s troll farms</a> wading into the 2016 US election to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/china-is-using-tiktok-for-influence-campaigns-odni-says-00146336">Chinese disinformation campaigns</a> on TikTok sowing division today — have learned to infiltrate these same open channels to destabilize democracies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of us celebrated the collapse of media gatekeepers and the rise of a free-for-all, digital public square in the 21st century. In its early days, the internet was hailed as a democratizing force. But the same qualities that made it feel liberating — openness, access, immediacy — also made it ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no easy way to resolve this tension. Free expression is both democracy’s strength and its weakness.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How much do Americans truly value free expression?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the liberal imagination, free speech is a neutral principle that guarantees a fair contest of ideas, protecting all sides equally. The post-liberal right and MAGA Republicans treat it like a weapon. Speech is power, and judging by their rhetoric and actions this past week, they’re happy to police it when it serves their side.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From their perspective, this is all fair game. Liberals, they say, aren’t really committed to free speech either. They sat by as their allies on the left brought the hammer of repression on “incorrect” beliefs for the last decade or more. They feel justified in using state power the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s truth in this critique. The left has its own illiberal reflexes. Cancel campaigns, deplatforming, disinvitations — from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/03/middlebury-students-shout-down-lecture-charles-murray">Middlebury students</a> shouting down Charles Murray to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/03/media/new-york-times-tom-cotton-op-ed">New York Times staffers</a> revolting over an op-ed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/us/hamline-university-islam-prophet-muhammad.html">Hamline University</a> dismissing an art-history professor for showing images of the Prophet Muhammad — the left has had its turn at enforcing orthodoxy.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the difference is that the right now wields the machinery of government to enforce their reflexes in ways Democratic administrations have not done in any comparable way. We’re not talking about sophomores at Wesleyan storming the quad for Palestine.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the crucial distinction, and how we’ve arrived at this juncture, where institutions powerful enough to shape the public square are giving way to political pressure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what happened here. Nexstar — which owns roughly 200 stations across the country — and ABC didn’t even attempt to defend their own autonomy. They apparently calculated that fighting the government was too costly, especially with billions in merger approvals on the line. So they surrendered. And when institutions with that much power fold, it sends a message to everyone else: Don’t push too far, don’t mock the wrong person, don’t risk your future. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is why you don’t have to care about Jimmy Kimmel to care about what just happened. The point isn’t whether you think his monologue was funny or offensive or worse. The point is whether you’re comfortable with the president of the United States using regulatory threats to remove a critic from national television. If the government can do it to Kimmel, it can — and eventually will — do it to anyone who stumbles over the wrong line.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump got to where he is because he saw a vulnerability in our system. In a media environment like this, shamelessness is a superpower. You can push the bounds of polite discourse and flood the zone with bullshit as long as you have no scruples. And now, having benefited from the openness of our public square, he&#8217;s slamming the gates shut behind him.</p>
