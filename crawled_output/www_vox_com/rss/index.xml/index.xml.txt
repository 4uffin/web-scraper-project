<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early months of the war in Ukraine, Gen. Mark Milley, then chair of the joint chiefs of staff, carried a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2022/ukraine-road-to-war/">note card in his briefcase outlining</a> what he saw as the main priorities when it came to the US and NATO approach to the war. As reported by the Washington Post, they were: No. 1: “Don’t have a kinetic conflict between the U.S. military and NATO with Russia.” No. 2: “Contain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.” No. 3: “Strengthen and maintain NATO unity.” No. 4: “Empower Ukraine and give them the means to fight.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The order is telling. Supporting Ukraine has been a priority, but preventing escalation outside of Ukraine has often been a greater one, sometimes to the frustration of Ukrainian leaders who have at times felt that Western governments were too timid in supporting actions like long-range strikes into Russian territory. Milley is long gone from American leadership, but that attitude carried over with the return of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed concerns that the conflict could escalate to World War III.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s been remarkable over the past week to see the degree to which NATO leaders appear to have come around to the view that NATO-Russia conflict — hopefully only limited conflict — may be inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The reason is a series of increasingly brazen incursions into NATO airspace. On September 8, 21 <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/461211/drones-poland-russia-ukraine">Russian drones entered Polish territory</a>, where some of them were shot down by an unprecedented Polish-German-Italian-Dutch military operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s at least plausible, though somewhat hard to believe given the number of them, that those drones entered Polish airspace inadvertently while on their way to strike targets in Ukraine. Drones have periodically crossed into and crashed on the territory of several NATO countries bordering Ukraine since the start of the war. The fact that they were unmanned vehicles also made the situation easier to deescalate: that drones can be shot down without human casualties is one reason leaders are often willing to take more controversial or riskier actions with them. (In a notable 2023 incident, Russian jets collided with and <a href="https://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/The-US-Russia-drone-collision-over-the-Black-Sea-is-a-sign-of-increasingly-unfriendly-skies-a719f67c24a634630858ef7c18abd5356">downed an American MQ-9 Reaper drone</a> over the Black Sea.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The incident last Friday, in which three <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/world/europe/russian-fighter-jets-estonia-nato.html">Russian fighter jets violated Estonia’s airspace</a> for 12 minutes, where they were intercepted by NATO jets, had the potential to become something much more dangerous. Unlike Poland, Estonia does not border Ukraine; it’s hundreds of miles away. And in this case, the aircraft were manned. The Russian government has denied that it violated Estonian airspace.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/drone-incursions-force-airport-closures-in-copenhagen-oslo-ee49ba4d?mod=world_lead_story">series of drone sightings forced airports</a> in Copenhagen and Oslo to close for several hours. On Thursday, drones shut down a second Danish airport, this one used for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmarks-aalborg-airport-closed-due-drones-airspace-2025-09-24/">commercial and military flights</a>. Norwegian and Danish authorities did not initially confirm widespread allegations — including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — that these drones were Russian, but Danish authorities have concluded they were linked to a “state actor,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-reopens-airports-after-drone-disruption-2025-09-25/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">These incidents took center stage at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York City this week, with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski explicitly threatening to shoot down any additional aircraft that entered his country’s airspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“If another missile or aircraft enters our space without permission, deliberately or by mistake, and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don’t come here to whine about it. You have been warned,” he said, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/22/at-unsc-meeting-west-and-russia-clash-over-nato-airspace-violations">addressing the Russian delegation</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We stand ready to take all steps necessary to defend NATO’s skies and NATO’s territory against Russia’s imperialist warmongering,” <a href="https://x.com/YvetteCooperMP/status/1970212309504041026">UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper</a>&nbsp;said.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More surprisingly, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-shifts-from-talk-action-targeting-nato-homeland-amid-fears-global-war">responded,</a> “Yes, I do,” on Tuesday when asked by a reporter if he believed NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their territory. “<a href="https://kyivindependent.com/poland-estonia-react-to-trumps-calls-to-shoot-down-russian-fighter-jets/">Roger that</a>,” Sikorski posted on X in response.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This comes amid this week’s hawkish turn in Trump’s frequently shifting views on the war in Ukraine, which also included a Truth Social post arguing that Ukraine will be able to retake all of its original territory, contradicting recent statements from many of his own senior officials.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this talk went over well with Russian officials. In a radio interview on Thursday, Russia’s ambassador to France <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/russia-ukraine-war/russian-ambassador-warns-of-war-if-nato-countries-shoot-down-aircraft/3699007">warned</a> that if a Russian jet were shot down over NATO territory, “it would mean war.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the warnings will be enough to deter future Russian provocations. History suggests they will not. And if Russia persists, we appear to be headed for the type of clash that not so long ago was viewed as the nightmare scenario. The question is whether it can be contained.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sending signals; testing unity</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Putin wants to signal to us, to say, ‘You Lithuanians, you Poles, if you continue to support Ukraine, the war will come to you. You will feel this,’” Eitvydas Bajarūnas, a veteran Lithuanian diplomat and former ambassador to Russia, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The incursions have spurred calls for increased NATO investment in air defense and drone detection. They have also highlighted how Russia’s cheap, replaceable kamikaze drones can provide a strategic advantage. One Estonian official described them to the Associated Press as a “lottery ticket that always wins” — either <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-nato-drones-estonia-latvia-lithuania-50636d55bff486b74e73ab947076744f">they hit their target</a> or the enemy has to down them with a missile that costs far more than the drone. European diplomats are <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/estonia-ukraine-meet-drone-wall-proposal-airspace-russia-warplanes/">planning for a meeting</a> Friday to discuss planned investments in a so-called drone wall: a system of sensors, electronic warfare systems, and weapons to prevent further violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the shorter term, the countries along NATO’s eastern border are planning for more Russian provocations. Lithuania’s parliament, to take one example, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lithuania-authorises-army-shoot-down-drones-violating-its-airspace-2025-09-23/">authorized the country’s</a> military to shoot down any drones that enter its airspace.&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“If the Europeans are repeatedly warning Russia not to violate its airspace over and over and over again, and nothing happens, then what kind of message does that send?”</p><cite>Rachel Rizzo, senior fellow and NATO analyst at the Atlantic Council</cite></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Bajarūnas, now a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, acknowledged that a violation by manned aircraft, as happened in nearby Estonia last week, would pose tougher decisions for NATO leaders. “There will be no automaticity,” he said of the decision on whether to shoot down an aircraft. “Each case will be weighed and discussed among allies as much as possible, but sometimes you need to make decisions in minutes.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Russian government may also be looking to test whether all those allies are on the same page. Western European countries have traditionally been thought of as less hawkish on Russia than Poland and the Baltic states, given those countries’ fraught history with Russia and the Soviet Union. In a meeting on Tuesday, CNN reports, representatives of NATO governments were divided on whether to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/25/politics/nato-divided-repeated-russian-incursions-response">make it a policy</a> to meet any additional incursions by force, including manned aircraft, with Germany and some southern European countries opposed. They settled on a policy that countries should take whatever steps they feel are necessary. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The even bigger question mark may be whether Washington is on board, says Liana Fix, senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. While Trump, this week anyway, is standing behind Eastern Europe’s right to defend its airspace, “I don’t believe this is the view of the vice presidency or the Pentagon, who want to prevent, above being drawn into a conflict with Russia and have viewed the Baltics with suspicion in that regard,” Fix said.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the Financial Times’s Gideon Rachman reported this week that Trump administration officials have complained about the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2ee21b5c-24fc-400e-a51d-2c197d09c471">“Estonization” of European defense policy</a>, referring to former Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who is now the EU’s foreign policy chief. The Baltic countries are viewed by some in power in Washington as dangerously “ideological” in their opposition to Putin. During this week’s meeting, the top US general for Europe, Alexus Grynkewich, reportedly ruffled some feathers by suggesting the Estonian incursion was likely accidental.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Not the end of the world?</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tensions are high as a war that has raged for years threatens to spill across international borders. Russia’s military is accused of war crimes as it targets civilians and bombs cities to rubble. As the blistering air campaign continues, Russian aircraft repeatedly fly — if only briefly — into NATO airspace, prompting fears that a shooting war could erupt between Russia and the Western military alliance, both armed with thousands of nuclear weapons. After repeated incursions, a Russian fighter jet that ignored multiple warnings from the ground is shot down over NATO territory — one of the two airmen is killed. #WorldWar3 trends on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The year is 2015, and the Russian jet was shot down <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/24/9790990/turkey-russia-plane-shootdown">over NATO member Turkey</a> after bombing nearby rebel targets in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad’s government. World War III, suffice to say, did not break out. Turkey and Russia restored relations in 2016 when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36643435">apologized for the incident</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2015 precedent is likely one on the minds of NATO policymakers as they contemplate a response to the recent air incursions. The growing consensus appears to be that the risks of allowing these provocations to continue outweigh the risks of responding to them. The Russian government has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/europe/putin-nuclear-warns-west-missile-strikes-ukraine-intl-latam">warned NATO countries of the prospect of all-out war</a> in the past, without following through on those threats. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"> “If the Europeans are repeatedly warning Russia not to violate its airspace over and over and over again, and nothing happens, then what kind of message does that send?” Rachel Rizzo, a senior fellow and NATO analyst at the Atlantic Council told Vox, summarizing this emerging thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it is notable that the sustained efforts by NATO governments and militaries to keep this raging war within Ukraine’s borders appear to be failing already. They may hope that a decisive show of force — perhaps even including NATO defenses downing a Russian jet or killing a pilot — is a necessary response to Russia’s latest escalation. But that doesn’t mean the escalation will end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Years of uncertainty around a possible TikTok ban in the United States may finally be coming to an end.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration is reportedly very close to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/tiktok-deal-us-china-details-b383abe4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiEuUpxelkTegVBycww_zGgdwQBtVqvOYVTTLKdoBBmDRITK_taipQD_YOTBUk%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d4346d&amp;gaa_sig=723nz_cHLmKSCQ9_WdR-aq9pinwne8o4GT2qTy2qo3Tx5ix5wVX8MYJyhY1ZnB9rbHGbxT06vAA29f8Rg5aPxA%3D%3D">finalizing a deal with China</a> to transfer US operations of the app to American control. Details are still murky, but right now it looks like the social media behemoth, which has around 170 million American users, will be run by a consortium of rich, right-wing investors, notably including the tech company Oracle and the Fox Corporation, which owns Fox News.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If — and it is still an <em>if</em> — this deal is finalized, it would mark the end of a five-year-plus odyssey for TikTok’s American presence. President Donald Trump attempted to ban the app over <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/06/900019185/trump-signs-executive-order-that-will-effectively-ban-use-of-tiktok-in-the-u-s">concerns about its Chinese ownership</a> during his first term, without success. Congress acted more definitively in 2024, passing a law that required<strong> </strong>TikTok to be sold to American operators or shut down. But when Trump came back into office, he had a change of heart — young voters shifted toward Trump in 2024, and his campaign attributed some of its success to its presence on the platform. Since then, Trump has signed a series of (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china">possibly illegal</a>) executive orders delaying implementation of the ban. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Noel King talked with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/amrith-ramkumar">Wall Street Journal reporter Amrith Ramkumar</a> about this backstory, what a US version of TikTok might look like, and the low-key billionaire who stands to get the keys to the app. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140">Pandora</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We are seeing a headline that suggests America is going to get TikTok. What is America going to get, exactly?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest thing is that the app will continue operating in the US. You&#8217;re going to be able to continue using it. So that&#8217;s step number one, I think, and that&#8217;s what the administration is focusing a lot on, that they&#8217;re the ones that prevented the app from going dark and any changes there.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you dig a little deeper, it is also very important that a group of US investors will now gain control of TikTok’s US operations. That&#8217;s been something a lot of people in Washington have been pushing for over five years, and it seems like they&#8217;re on the doorstep of making that happen.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What about the thing that makes TikTok TikTok, which is the algorithm? Does the US get that too?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That is the tens-of-billions-of-dollars question. Essentially the answer would be yes, based on what the administration and people around TikTok have said. There’d be a complex way of doing this where ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, would copy the algorithm it uses globally and then lease it to this new [US] entity that is being created by this transaction. The new entity would then control it and they would run it. It would be a US-specific algorithm, sort of.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>President Trump says he&#8217;ll sign an executive order about it later this week. What is in the deal? What do we know?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The deal&#8217;s not done. That&#8217;s the first thing to understand. It&#8217;s a preliminary agreement, sort of a framework. This executive order that the president is going to sign is basically going to say, from what we can tell, that we have the contours of the deal and they satisfy the law and the national security conditions. That&#8217;s one step in the process of finalizing things. </p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It&#8217;s not in their financial interest to come in and make a bunch of changes that overhaul things.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Basically, under this deal, US investors and allies essentially will take control of this new entity that&#8217;s created to run TikTok in the US. The understanding is that this new group of US investors, this consortium, featuring the private equity firm Silver Lake and cloud computing company Oracle, would be part of this group and they would own roughly half of this new entity. Existing ByteDance investors, which include some Trump allies, would own roughly 30 percent. That&#8217;s what lets ByteDance&#8217;s ownership stake drop just below the 20 percent outlined in the law. And it&#8217;s also important to note that that consortium has been changing by the day.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump mentioned the Murdochs over the weekend. He said Lachlan [Murdoch] might be involved.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. And we&#8217;re told that basically means Fox would invest. He mentioned Michael Dell, who&#8217;s also been reported around this. He could be involved. But Trump loves that element, right? Because now he has this framework agreement and investors are calling saying, <em>We want to be part of this deal because we know this is a very valuable company and a lucrative opportunity</em>. And so now he can sort of pick and choose who he lets in.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So Oracle has a significant stake. Others may join, others may drop out, but Oracle is a real player here, and we can&#8217;t talk about Oracle without talking about Larry Ellison. Who is Larry Ellison?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How much time do you have? Larry Ellison is one of the richest men in the world. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/23/technology/larry-ellison-oracle-tiktok.html">co-founded Oracle</a>. Start there. Oracle is one of the most important tech companies that most regular people have never heard about. They&#8217;re experts at working with large databases, which are key to the social media industry. More importantly now, Oracle is now seen as one of the leading AI companies because they do AI infrastructure and they work with companies like OpenAI. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But Larry Ellison has also expanded in other ways. His family is now preparing a bid for Warner Bros. through their company, Paramount Skydance. He has a lot of money. He&#8217;s pretty strategic with what he does with it. But yes, this TikTok deal would be his latest big win.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This has made a lot of people quite leery. You have a wealthy old man, a lot of wealthy old men involved in this consortium, Trump-aligned for the most part, controlling TikTok. Will they be able to manipulate the algorithm? Are they the ones who are going to be deciding what I see on TikTok?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s another really good question and something that hasn&#8217;t been fully addressed yet. I think priority one is showing they can run the app. They still have to prove the basic business case, the justification for doing a deal worth many billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s not in their financial interest to come in and make a bunch of changes that overhaul things. These people just want this deal done. TikTok just wants to operate in the US and users just want the experience to remain the same. Making changes or doing things that would be very disruptive seems against their own interests there.</p>

It’s one thing to get on a plane you think is heading to France and end up bound for North Africa.

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s one thing to get on a plane you think is heading to France and end up bound for North Africa. It’s another thing to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittneydzialo_/video/7546595810889305399">post that big oops on the internet</a> to millions of people ready to laugh and scrutinize your foolishness.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is reportedly what happened earlier this month when two American women traveling from Rome told an airline representative they wanted a flight “to Nice,” and the employee supposedly heard them say “Tunis,&#8221; as in the capital of Tunisia. They posted the video of the sitcom-esque saga — from the pair <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittneydzialo_/video/7547316930995031309">cracking up</a> as a flight attendant explained the error to their <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittneydzialo_/video/7547379016106396942">journey</a> after they elected to stay on the flight — to TikTok, and it quickly went viral. While many laughed at the farce, some were left confused as to how the women made such a huge mistake. One would assume that there were a few indications at the airport that they were boarding a plane to Tunis — including the fact that they were flying on Tunisair.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole “To Nice” versus Tunis fiasco feels emblematic of a sort of shamelessness that seems to fuel our most-watched content these days. This past year, it seems like the primary way to be online is to be kind of embarrassing, if not fully indulge in a rising subgenre of what we can only call &#8220;embarrassment porn.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most obvious example is the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/travel/new-york-floods-tiktok-meme.html">Jet2 holiday memes</a> where TikTok users uploaded videos of themselves getting thrown off towable tubes, surfboards, and engaging in other accidental physical comedy set to a cheery advert for the British budget airline. But that&#8217;s mortification on the fun, easy, and only-physically-harmful setting. Other entries in the genre include everything from posting about the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristatorres/womans-husband-packed-her-dog-food-for-lunch">sorry state of your marriage</a> to announcing your <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lina.ayalew/video/7545227885980781831?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7478002616509793838">lack</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@izathindwaofficial/video/7545910612207996173?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7478002616509793838">knowledge</a> about a sporting event you&#8217;re attending (let alone at the very costly <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/460328/us-open-2025-etiquette-worst-grand-slam">US Open</a>). The past year has seen one viral TikToker eagerly share their disregard for the boundaries and norms of the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/kendra-hilty-fell-in-love-with-psychiatrist-tiktok.html">therapist-client relationship</a>, while another was willing to broadcast that they were <a href="https://www.today.com/food/trends/tiktok-4th-of-july-antipasto-salad-drama-explained-rcna217998">kicked out of a party</a>. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It raises some questions for a generation known for dictating the boundaries of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/biggest-dating-app-faux-pas-for-gen-z-being-cringe/">what is awkward behavior and what isn’t</a>. What exactly counts as embarrassing nowadays? Is anything truly shameful in our ever-chaotic age?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, embarrassing content is not a new phenomenon. One of the first viral offerings of the early YouTube era was a woman standing on a table in wedge heels while belting a song, and subsequently suffering a violent fall (otherwise known as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lW1s575U5KE">Scarlet Takes a Tumble</a>”). The calamitous Jet2 Holiday memes mimic the decades-spanning clip show <em>America’s Funniest Home Videos </em>and the popular game show <em>Wipeout</em>. In fact, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/356854/cue-the-sun-review-emily-nussbaum-book-reality-tv-history-bethenny-frankel-survivor">entire genre of reality TV</a>, dating back to the 1940s, is built on average people being humiliated via planted microphones and later planted cameras.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cornell University professor and social researcher Brooke Erin Duffy also connects this sort of mortifying content to a bygone paparazzi culture.&nbsp;She says our collective glee in watching&nbsp;celebrities get caught looking foolish was “inflected with privilege” and had a &#8220;transactional&#8221; nature but it’s now trickled down to the average person.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s always been a grotesque fascination with seeing people at their worst,” says Duffy. “The paparazzi industry was predicated on capturing the rawness and vulnerability of famous people, people not like us. It’s interesting to see how that provided precursors for this era of vulnerability and where celebrities are managing their own social media presence.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the saturation of this content hasn’t totally normalized it, as young people are simultaneously if not equally concerned with what’s socially acceptable behavior and what’s not. Nothing is seemingly more undignified than coming off as “cringe.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8">viral 2020 video essay</a>, YouTuber Natalie Wynn (aka ContraPoints) describes cringe as “an electric shock, the emotional punishment for being awkward.” Cringe notably describes secondhand embarrassment by the person observing the behavior, not the feeling of shame experienced by the person doing the action. That said, cringe is relative and dependent on your environment. According to my 17-year-old-niece, markers of cringe include being a “Gen Z Trump supporter” or engaging in nerd cultures, like anime. If you look online, certain derided archetypes like “pick me’s” and “<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/459062/performative-male-gen-z-soft-boy-tiktok-harry-styles-jacob-elordi">performative males</a>” can fall under the cringe category.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to a certain age group, though, Gen Z has curated a much more <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/05/06/pop-culture/millennial-cringe-canon-pause-habits-tendencies">specific moodboard</a> for what’s cringe. According to various social media posts, including TikTok accounts dedicated to the aesthetic of “millennial cringe,” practically any hallmark of the late 2000s and early 2010s carries this mortifying sheen. Skinny jeans are cringe. Avocado toast is cringe. The pause before millennials start speaking in a selfie video is cringe. The Fox show <em>Glee</em> is cringe. The Broadway musical <em>Hamilton</em> is cringe. Millennials who feel targeted by these definitions might find themselves baffled to see Zoomers eagerly posting their own Ls online.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kaley Mullin, a youth and trends insight lead at YouTube and a contributor to the newsletter <a href="https://coolshinyculture.substack.com/">Cool Shiny Culture</a>, says that cringe often just encompasses anything that feels outdated to Gen Z. “A lot of it seems like it has to do with language and affect, slang like ‘pupper,’ ‘doggo,’ ‘but first, coffee’ seems especially ripe for Zoomer ridicule. An overly effusive, quirky affect feels like it gets dinged in the same way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That effusiveness speaks to the most common understanding of what causes “millennial cringe,” or possibly just cringe writ large: anything earnest. When the 2010 Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes song “Home” went viral last month after an X user declared it was the worst song ever made, it seemed to highlight an extreme level of sincerity, a disregard for seeming awkward, maybe just unabashed joy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s an ungenerous way to read all of this: that being ignorant or clumsy has a social currency, but being enthusiastic and genuine does not. The reality isn’t that simple, though. Gen Z is plenty emotional and socially uncomfortable online; in fact, the current cohort of youngsters have built a reputation for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/379902/viral-breakup-song-drama-tiktok-spritely">crying on camera</a>, broadcasting their angry outbursts (labeled “<a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/418072/crash-out-slang-justin-bieber-love-island-usa-huda-tiktok-therapy">crash outs</a>”), and oversharing details of their personal lives and relationships. Yet, this vulnerability is often displayed with a level of social media savviness and self-awareness. Whereas millennials, as Duffy argues, “came of age lacking a sense of social media performativity.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This distinction, some argue, keeps these current soul-baring users from stepping into “cringe” territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“What&#8217;s unique and cool about Gen Z is they&#8217;re more aware that embarrassment loses its power when it&#8217;s owned and shared,” says Mullin. “Being the one to address an embarrassing thing you did by posting about it destigmatizes that thing. It turns it into an amusing anecdote versus something that keeps you up at night.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, it’s even more than an amusing anecdote, it’s an opening. In 2024, when a TikTok user named Reesa Teesa shared upward of 50 videos about her experience being duped by her pathological-liar husband in a series titled “<a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/who-tf-did-i-marry-summary-reesa-teesa-legion.html">Who TF Did I Marry?</a>,” one can at least assume she was operating partly under an awareness that there’s some sort of power, if not just attention, to be gained from publicly sharing these. For <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/tareasa-reesa-teesa-johnson-signs-caa-1235843279/">her</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011201176/new-movie-zola-is-based-on-a-long-series-of-tweets">others</a>, they have even resulted in career opportunities. The same can be speculated about the “To Nice vs. Tunis” girls. It’s probably not a coincidence that the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittneydzialo_">poster</a> was already a fairly successful influencer, seemingly with an understanding of what would grab her feed’s attention.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to what can be gained from these moments, Duffy says that Gen Z may also feel like they have less risk in looking silly or embarrassing, specifically on an app like TikTok where posts are largely viewed by strangers because of the algorithmic system.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“On TikTok, there seems to be less of a sense of fear over what we call ‘imagined surveillance’ because you aren’t necessarily coming into contact with these people on a daily basis,” she says. “People have a following on Instagram and Facebook, but it’s kind of predicated on individuals who you come into contact with in your offline life.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To form a theory of Gen Z cringe would probably just mean looking to Gen Alpha in the next few years. So far, it seems like they’ve mostly just accepted the trends that have been passed down to them from the past generation. A <a href="https://www.accelerationcc.com/intelligence/gen-alpha-mini-mighty-and-market-ready">study</a> by marketing firm Acceleration found that today’s kids are similarly interested in following average people who they perceive as relatable, as opposed to traditional, lofty celebrities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, in a moment where Americans are purportedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/378924/loneliness-epidemic-solutions-religion-volunteering-community-purpose-meaning">more isolated</a> than ever before, there’s a level of capital in being someone people can see themselves in, even at the expense of looking embarrassing. “The important thing to note about posting something cringy is that it reinforces relatability in an era where relatability is everything,” Mullin says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Especially for influencers who are making serious money and getting amazing access to exclusive events, it&#8217;s less cool to flaunt an unattainable aspirational lifestyle and more cool to show off how starstruck you were when a celebrity walked past you,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe the rise in mortifying videos is a natural changing of the tides following a decade of tightly curated, highly airbrushed Instagram posts and the initial perfection-obsessed wave of influencers. The most cringe thing for Gen Z might just be pretending that life isn’t naturally debasing.&nbsp;</p>

Tom Homan, the White House border czar, allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as business executives during a sting operation last year, according to MSNBC.

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tom Homan, the White House border czar, allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as business executives during a sting operation last year, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/tom-homan-cash-contracts-trump-doj-investigation-rcna232568">according to MSNBC</a>. The payment was made after Homan implied that he could help the agents secure government contracts in a second Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In layperson’s terms, this is what bribery looks like: officials promising favors in exchange for money. In this case, Homan was not a government official at the time of the sting, though he had said during the 2024 election that he would likely have a role <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/tom-homan-cash-contracts-trump-doj-investigation-rcna232568">in a second Trump term</a>. The investigation related to Homan — which was launched during the Biden administration and was first reported by MSNBC this past weekend — was only recently shut down. FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that prosecutors “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, we don’t know the full details of the case, and, in the absence of a full investigation or a trial, we can’t know that Homan is guilty of hatching a bribery scheme. But to say this should raise eyebrows is an understatement.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Homan story raises a question that has come up over and over again since President Donald Trump catapulted himself to the White House: Do American voters actually care about corruption? After all, Trump has so far gotten away with <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/403900/trump-musk-conflicts-of-interest-ethics-rules">maintaining unprecedented conflicts of interest</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/412901/trump-qatar-plane-gift-air-force-one">accepting gifts from foreign governments</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/460757/trump-crypto-presidency-profits-corruption">turning the presidency into a giant cash grab</a>. And despite his history of fraud and corruption, he still won a second term last November.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/51398-most-americans-see-corruption-as-serious-problem">polls consistently indicate</a> that a majority of Americans think that corruption is a serious problem that plagues Congress, the presidency, and the Supreme Court. And there’s evidence that corruption scandals can drag down politicians. One recent example is Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, who was indicted last year on corruption charges. An overwhelming majority of New Yorkers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/nyregion/eric-adams-resign-poll.html">believe that Adams should resign</a>, and his reelection bid seems all but doomed: Most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html">recent polls show</a> Adams’s support is in single-digits.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So why is it that no level of corruption in the Trump administration — no matter how brazen or how high up it goes, from Homan to <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/tracker-trump-appointees-in-the-pocket-of-big-corporations/">other members of Trump’s Cabinet</a> to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/460757/trump-crypto-presidency-profits-corruption">first family</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/412901/trump-qatar-plane-gift-air-force-one">the president himself</a> — seems to ever stick?</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump broke one of the biggest guardrails against corruption</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Trump’s first term, a lot has been said about his attacks on institutions and his utter disregard for the rules and norms that preserve American democracy. But one of the biggest guardrails that Trump quickly shattered isn’t any kind of institution or law; it’s the effectiveness of public shaming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Public shaming can be a powerful weapon for citizens protesting their government. It creates an environment that makes the shamed person lose legitimacy, and it puts pressure on institutions or other people in power to take action. And the prospect of public shaming likely deters some politicians from taking shortcuts or engaging in petty corruption, not out of principle or ethics but out of fear of getting caught. After all, public shaming was a tool that ultimately helped push many politicians to resign in disgrace, from President Richard Nixon to former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has discovered that not caving to shame eventually leads people to let go and move on. His seeming inability to feel shame has allowed him to plow through scandals — like <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/07/10/american-carnage-excerpt-access-hollywood-tape-227269/">the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape</a> — that would have easily ended other politicians’ careers. It’s also allowed him to maintain a sprawling web of conflicts of interest without feeling the need to answer to anyone. Throughout his time in politics, Trump has shown little remorse for his misdeeds, and his strategy to simply power through scandals, often with no apologies, has proven remarkably effective.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And other politicians have taken notice. For example, Cuomo, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-resigns.html">resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct</a> in 2021, has tried to stage a comeback by running for mayor of New York City. But that doesn’t mean that shaming no longer works at all. Cuomo couldn’t outrun his past as his opponents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/nyregion/cuomo-sexual-harassment-women.html">reminded voters</a> of why he resigned in the first place, and he eventually went on to lose the Democratic primary earlier this year. And, if the polls are accurate, he is on track to lose the general election in November as well. But when it comes to Trump, Americans have yet to find the scandal that can shame his way to political irrelevance.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trump’s assault on public shaming has disempowered voters</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two main reasons why Trump and his administration are so often able to avoid any accountability for potential corruption, even though there is evidence that voters do care about corrupt governance, as Eric Adams’s downfall shows. First, Trump’s core supporters are willing to look the other way because their priority is supporting Trump’s broader political project. In some cases, some of the president’s supporters might not believe any of the allegations of corruption or might point to how the president’s opponents are corrupt as well. In fact, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-democrats-more-corrupt-than-republicans-poll-1235396092/">many American voters believe</a> the Democratic Party is more corrupt than the GOP.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, and more importantly, while the president’s opponents might care about the corruption in his administration, Trump’s ability to wiggle out of any consequences and ignore public shaming tactics has made people feel powerless. He won a second term, for example, despite being <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rape-carroll-trial-fe68259a4b98bb3947d42af9ec83d7db">found liable for sexual abuse and defamation</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0">getting convicted</a> of crimes, including falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments. So while incidents of potential corruption might draw a lot of voters’ ire, they’re unlikely to break through and become full-fledged scandals because many Democratic voters seem resigned to the fact that Trump will likely get away with the story of the day, just as he has over and over again since his first campaign for president in 2016.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of what might be driving that general sense of apathy in the opposition is that Trump is term-limited, and unlike his first term, he can’t run for reelection. That leaves many people in the mindset of waiting out Trump’s second term instead of actively resisting it as they did during his first presidency. So while they know they’re stuck with him for now, they also know they’re not going to be stuck with him forever.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that corruption and abuse of power won’t ever galvanize resistance to Trump, especially as the midterms get underway next year. Democrats hoping to win back the House will likely highlight how a Democratic majority in at least one chamber of Congress would be a check on the president’s corruption. In fact, some Democratic operatives are pushing Democrats to embrace that message and focus on Trump’s “culture of corruption” as their midterm strategy, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/every-day-another-grotesque-secret">according to a memo obtained by the Bulwark</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Democrats go with that advice will depend on whether they believe Americans care enough about Trump’s corruption. And so far this year, it seems the answer to that question is no. But that might not always be the case, especially if an anti-corruption coalition finds the right messenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been five or six years since I stopped answering my phone. With the exception of family or work calls, most of which I’m expecting, everyone now goes straight to voicemail, where my iPhone software dutifully transcribes the messages, which are almost always robocalls or spam. And my text messages are even more of a mess than my unanswered calls.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple has promised to help with a couple of new features in iOS 26. You might not have noticed, even if you’ve updated your iPhone, because the most ambitious feature, which uses AI to screen calls, is off by default. (You’ll be prompted to turn it on when you first open the Phone app after updating to iOS 26, or you can turn it on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/111106">in your Phone app settings</a> by selecting “Ask Reason for Calling.”) Another new feature that filters out spam texts is on by default, but it’s a little bit confusing to figure out how it works. I am nevertheless down to try anything.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some 80 percent of Americans are like me and don’t answer calls from unknown numbers. That’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/12/14/most-americans-dont-answer-cellphone-calls-from-unknown-numbers/">according to a 2020 Pew Survey</a>, and I’d guess the percentage is higher today, especially after the scam-bonanza that the pandemic launched. Meanwhile, text spam is definitely increasing, at least according to <a href="https://www.robokiller.com/spam-text-insights">an ongoing tally from Robokiller</a>, which makes spam-blocking software. This past August alone, Americans received a head-spinning 19.2 billion spam texts, which amounts to 63 spam texts per person that month. The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/04/new-ftc-data-show-top-text-message-scams-2024-overall-losses-text-scams-hit-470-million?utm_source=chatgpt.com">estimates</a> that Americans lose $470 billion a year to text-based scams.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Who’s to blame for this mess? The state of accountability looks like <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man">that Spider-Man meme</a>, except everyone is pointing at the scammers and spammers. But really, carriers, regulators, and tech companies are all to blame, and the problem is getting worse.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“This should be a collective, societal solution, because this is such a horrible problem in this country, and it has been for years and years and years,” <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/people/teresa-murray/">Teresa Murray</a>, a consumer watchdog at the US PIRG Education Fund, told me. “Most people that I know, old people, young people, middle-aged people, professionals, students, no matter what they do, everybody that I talk to has a certain amount of skepticism answering their phone, and that&#8217;s unfortunate.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Apple gets more serious screening calls</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple’s new features both improve and complicate the situation. Once you’ve turned on the iPhone’s new call screening features, unknown callers are greeted by Siri instead of you or your voicemail. Siri asks them to state their name and the reason for their call before your phone even rings, their answer gets transcribed in real time, and a notification is sent to your iPhone. If you ignore it, the call goes straight to voicemail. If you tap the alert, you’ll see the transcription, and from there, you can type in a response to the person calling, answer the call, or just hit stop to disconnect. If it’s someone you want to talk to in the future, you can later mark them as “Known” so they don’t have to go through the screening process again.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a lot of steps, just to decide if you want to answer a phone call. It’s also giving you a lot more agency over the situation, which is out of control. Caller ID is so easily spoofed that even the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/spoofing">recommends you don’t answer calls</a> from unknown numbers. If you do pick up, there’s a chance it’s a scammer using widely available AI tools <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/privacy-identity-protection/artificial-imposters-cybercriminals-turn-to-ai-voice-cloning-for-a-new-breed-of-scam/">to clone the voice of a loved one</a> — they can find their voice from video clips on social media — and talk you into sending them money. At the very least, picking up a call will let scammers and spammers know your number is active and that you’ll answer it, two pieces of information that <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/unknown-number-do-not-answer/">could lead to even more scams and spam</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new call screening feature on iPhones protects you from a couple of these problems but not all of them. By forcing the bad actor to engage with Siri and try to convince you they’re legitimate, the software gives you an extra line of defense. Of course, scammers will come up with new tricks for this, too. When Siri asks them to identify themselves, the person on the other end can say whatever they want, including, “Hey, it’s me, and I’m in trouble.” There’s also <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/articles/call-screening-in-iphone-ios26-nice-effort-to-combat-robocalls-but/'">no option to hear that recording</a> and confirm it’s your loved one or even a human. It’s also unclear if Siri answering the call will also tell the bad actors that they’ve reached an active phone number, setting you up for more fake calls.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other tech companies have their own solutions to unwanted calls. A few months ago, Google released <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-call-assist-call-notes-tips/">a suite of AI-powered call screening features</a> for its Pixel phones, some of which work a lot like what Apple now has for iPhones. A similar call screening option <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-8-5-automatic-call-screening-3599737/">is reportedly coming to Samsung Galaxy phones</a> in the future, too. But regardless of what kind of phone you have, the Google Voice app has offered <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/9262934?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid%27">a dead-simple way</a> to screen calls: It just asks unknown callers to state their names, and then it plays that recording for you when you pick up but before the call is actually connected. It’s a lot like what Apple, Google, and Samsung are doing now — but with actual human interaction instead of AI flourishes.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Text messages are starting to look more like email</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there are the unwanted text messages. You’d think that blocking unwanted texts would be as easy as sending all your spam emails to a junk folder. The text messaging infrastructure is fundamentally different than that of email, however, and it’s harder to build in certain filters. The FCC did <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fcc-orders-phone-companies-to-block-scam-text-messages/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">finalize its first-ever rules</a> on scam texts last year, but as you’re surely well aware, the unwanted texts keep coming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple is tackling this problem with new text message screening options in iOS 26. They’re confusing, so bear with me. First of all, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/08/07/to-no-ones-surprise-politicians-are-wrong-about-ios-26-message-filtering">since 2019</a>, you’ve been able to toggle on the “Filter Unknown Senders” feature in the Messages app settings on iPhones. If you did, messages from anyone who wasn’t in your contacts or whom you’d never texted would get sent to a different inbox, which was kind of hard to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In iOS 26, if you turn on “Screen Unknown Senders,” those messages are two taps away from your main inbox: Just look for the three lines in the upper right-hand corner of the Messages app. You can also manage whether you get notifications when these messages arrive, and you can mark senders as “Known” if you don’t want them ending up in the “Unknown Senders” inbox again —&nbsp;or delete the whole conversation and flag it as spam.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s the new “Filter Spam” feature, which uses constantly updated on-device spam detection software to keep junk out of your main Messages inbox. This one is on by default, and you can find the messages in a “Spam” folder right below the “Unknown Senders” folder in the menu you access by tapping the three lines (you can’t reply to messages in the “Spam” folder and their links are disabled, unless you move them out of that folder). Additionally, you can activate even more filters by turning on Apple’s standard “Text Message Filter,” which creates folders for “Transactions” and “Promotions” and automatically sends those kinds of messages there (this option has been available in Brazil and India <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15s-new-sms-spam-filtering-feature-is-limited-to-brazil-heres-why/">for a few years</a>). You also have the option to add a third-party filter from apps, like <a href="https://www.hiya.com/">Hiya</a>, <a href="https://www.nomorobo.com/">Nomorobo</a>, and <a href="https://www.robokiller.com/">Robokiller</a>, that promise to help you tame your texting chaos (they can handle spam phone calls, too).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If all these text message folders are starting to sound a lot like your email inbox, that’s probably by design. Over the years, we’ve made progress in taming the torrent of email spam, so why not try to take text messages down a similar path? Still, once I activated all of Apple’s various text message screens and filters and inboxes, I found that it was easier to miss messages I may have otherwise wanted to see, like the invitation to a party I found only after the party was over.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no silver bullet to eliminate all spam calls and texts. In fact, a little bit getting through is probably the best option for most people. If you see a new doctor, for instance, you’ll want to know they called, even if their specific extension isn’t in your contacts or recognized as a frequent contact. And even if you spend money on a sophisticated filtering app and take the time to get all the settings right, you’re bound to miss something important. I talked to someone recently whose spam filter kept blocking the passport agency’s phone call. She ended up having to cancel a vacation because of it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the big problem with scammers is that they scam. Over 70 percent of Americans say they know someone who’s been a victim of an online scam, and 30 percent say they’ve fallen for one themselves, <a href="https://media.mcafeeassets.com/content/dam/npcld/ecommerce/en-us/msd/resources/mcafee-scam-detector-factsheet.pdf">according to McAfee consumer research</a>. I almost fell for a sophisticated IRS phone scam a few years ago, and a New York Times reporter who covers scams recently wrote about coming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/zelle-chase-banking-scam.html">dangerously close to falling for a Zelle scam</a>. All scammers need to get started on you is a nugget of data, something that might get you to pick up the phone or reply to a text to get more information.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“By harvesting that information on the fly, they&#8217;re either able to scam you on the spot, or be able to enrich their database so that the next time around they can target you in a more directed manner,” said <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/author/abhishek-karnik/">Abhishek Karnik</a>, director for threat research and response at McAfee.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, each scam attempt feeds into the next, and the attempts are never-ending. It’s nice that tech companies are giving us more tools to fight back. But it’s still not enough.</p>

The typical story is similar to a recent New York magazine feature in which a college student openly admits to <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html">using generative AI to “to cheat on nearly every assignment.”</a></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/07/the-end-of-the-english-paper?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhfacebook&amp;utm_content=null">so</a> <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/opinion-the-ai-cheating-crisis-education-needs-its-anti-doping-movement/2024/02">many</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/15/i-received-a-first-but-it-felt-tainted-and-undeserved-inside-the-university-ai-cheating-crisis">news</a> <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/new-data-reveal-how-many-students-are-using-ai-to-cheat/2024/04">headlines</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/advice/413189/ai-cheating-college-humanities-education-chatgpt">anecdotes</a> like these circulating, it feels like the rug is being pulled out from beneath the educational system. The exams, readings, and essays that were hallmarks of school now seem to be littered with AI cheating. In the most extreme cases, students use tools like ChatGPT to write and turn in full essays.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It can feel disheartening — but that common narrative is far from the full story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheating is not a new phenomenon. I am an education researcher who studies AI cheating and our early evidence suggests that AI has changed the method but not necessarily the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560"><em>amount</em> of cheating</a> that was already happening.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t to say that cheating using AI is nothing to worry about or that it doesn’t pose new concerns. There are still important questions to figure out: Will cheating eventually increase in the future because of AI? Is <em>all</em> AI use for schoolwork cheating? How should parents and schools respond when we want to prepare our kids to succeed in a world that looks so different from what we experienced?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There are no easy answers yet, but to have a better understanding of our generational angst and growing worries, we need to unpack our understanding of cheating and how that affects what we know about how kids are using AI in school.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The ubiquity of cheating&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheating has been around for a very long time — probably as long as schools have been around. In the 1990s and 2000s, Don McCabe, a business school professor at Rutgers University, documented very high levels of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327019eb1103_2">cheating in university students</a>. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-997-0046-y">One study</a> from the ’90s, for example, broke down instances of cheating by major and found that up to 96 percent of students pursuing business majors reported engaging in “cheating behavior.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">How could McCabe get such surprising numbers? He used anonymous student surveys that asked students to report approximately how often they engaged in particular behaviors. These questions are worded carefully to withhold judgment or obvious negative associations. For example, a student would be asked how many times in the past year they had used an electronic device to find information during a test. Compared to other methods that asked students to state whether they had cheated, McCabe’s method resulted in far higher numbers of self-reported cheating behaviors.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Our early evidence suggests that AI has changed the method but not necessarily the <em>amount</em> of cheating that was already happening.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Those methods persist in much of the research today. Other, more recent studies from McCabe’s group showed that, up to 2020, more than 60 percent of students <a href="https://www.academicintegrity.org/aws/ICAI/pt/sp/facts">reported engaging in cheating behaviors</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">College students cheat for a range of reasons. For instance, students who feel <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40979-022-00117-w">very anxious about math</a> have incentive to cheat in a subject where they believe they cannot otherwise succeed. On the other hand, for assignments that seem like low priority, busy-work — such as excessively long problem sets — cheating feels like a time-saver. If students think that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-018-9680-x">everyone else around them is cheating</a>, they are prone to view certain behaviors as more acceptable. Similarly, students consider cheating more acceptable if they sense that a class (or teacher or school) just <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508422.2025.2514577">does not really care</a> about what students are getting from the class.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For high schoolers, the cheating numbers have long been high as well. <a href="https://www.plagiarism.org/article/plagiarism-facts-and-stats">Multiple</a> <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/wancac-2">studies</a> in the 2010s had the figure above 80 percent, drawing from samples across many high schools in many regions. Again, this was all <em>before</em> ChatGPT and its ilk had entered the scene. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X01910884">High schoolers have named similar reasons</a> for cheating as compared to undergraduates. However, for many high schoolers, there is also an <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/doing-school-denise-clark-pope/1111656895;jsessionid=0E076A17A746C04630389F57AD29F50F.prodny_store02-atgap09?ean=9780300098334">intense pressure</a> to do too much with too little time to get into the college of their (or their parents’) choice. This makes cheating — even if only on the assignments that don’t feel worth their time — seem like an acceptable option to get by.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason these numbers may seem high is because, in these types of studies, “cheating” and “cheating behaviors” can encompass a broad set of behaviors. It’s not merely a student submitting an assignment that someone else — or some technology&nbsp;— completed and calling it their own. Depending on the study, cheating can range from using a third party service or website (like <a href="https://www.chegg.com/">Chegg</a> or <a href="https://www.coursehero.com">Course Hero</a>) to get answers or prewritten essays, copying from a classmate when coming to class unprepared, or making up an excuse to get an extension. (Professors like to joke that by moving classes from early morning to mid-afternoon, they see huge drops in the number of family funerals taking place during midterms and finals weeks.)&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><br><strong>Cheating in the AI age</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So what about now? Has there been an increase in AI-specific cheating?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">From the 2018–2019 and 2021–2022 school years, my colleagues Denise Pope, Sarah Miles, Rosalia Zarate, and I reviewed anonymous survey data from over 1,900 students at three high schools (one private, one charter, and one public). This was before ChatGPT was released and we were interested in how different school and situational factors (like the pandemic) had affected cheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, in the 2022–2023 school year, we went back to these same schools to see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560">how cheating behaviors might have changed</a> after ChatGPT was introduced. The data suggested that cheating numbers stayed the same before and immediately after the release of ChatGPT and were even in the same range as the numbers before the pandemic.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the pandemic, 61.3 percent to 82.7 percent of students had reported engaging in any “cheating behavior” in the prior month. In late spring of 2023, after ChatGPT came out, the number ranged from 59 percent to 64.4 percent. Those numbers did not show an increase (though the decrease could be statistical noise). Of course, this is partly because the numbers were <em>already</em> high.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We can be more specific. For behaviors related to copying other work, whether from a peer or online, there was little to no change. Before ChatGPT, 21 percent to 30.6 percent of students reported behaviors like paraphrasing or copying just a few sentences from another written source without attribution. After ChatGPT came out, this range was 24.8 percent to 31.2 percent.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While the overall numbers are similar before and after ChatGPT, this does not mean that students were abstaining from AI. Taking the public school as an example, about 30 percent of students were copying and pasting from another source in <em>some</em> capacity both before and after generative AI entered the scene. Once generative AI was widely available, 11 percent of students were using it to write <em>all</em> of a paper, project or assignment. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our research involved a lot of complicated numbers and methodology but does suggest that AI seemed to get some market share in the world of copy-paste cheating. But we have to wonder: Would those same 11 percent of students have gone to an online service like Chegg, Bartleby, or Course Hero or otherwise copy-pasted text from Wikipedia if ChatGPT were not around?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, we do not have access to the multiverse where we can study the present world without AI to know for sure. But we do have ongoing research. With funding from the <a href="https://www.templeton.org/">John Templeton Foundation</a> and through collaboration with <a href="https://challengesuccess.org/">Challenge Success</a>, an educational nonprofit, we are continuing to track AI cheating as it unfolds over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One limitation of our high school study was that not everyone knew enough about ChatGPT. The TikToks and tips on using it had not yet gone viral when we completed our earlier study, and it was possible that the study was too early. Now, we are analyzing data from the last two years (the 2023–2024 school year and 2024–2025 school year) with larger numbers of students (over 28,000 in 2024 and over 39,000 in 2025) and more schools (22 public and charter high schools in 2024, 24 public and charter high schools in 2025) in the sample.&nbsp;(We chose to focus on public and charter schools because they represent the vast majority of schools in the US. As we are still analyzing the data, it is currently unpublished.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the same earlier patterns continue. In 2024, 11 percent of these students were using AI to complete all of a paper, project, or assignment — that figure grew to 15 percent in 2025. In 2024, a substantial number of students —&nbsp;over half of students — were using AI to generate ideas. In 2025, about 40 percent are using AI to improve the work they produced. This can look like having AI suggest (or make) revisions on a paper the student wrote, check the answers they got on an assignment, or provide information that they may have previously Googled.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To investigate this in more detail, we also sent trained staff to talk more with high school students about AI. They report that some use AI but have a sense of what would be egregiously inappropriate and plagiaristic AI use. Most students try to stay away from that extreme and it is the moderate use of AI and the reasons for using it that are more complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The complexities of using AI</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One focus group student reported that they do not get to their homework until late at night, and when they need help with questions, everyone is already asleep. AI, however, does not sleep, so it is available to provide help or work them through an assignment, though the student doesn’t use it to&nbsp; complete the assignment for them entirely. Their message to educators was, “So just remember that if I used it, it was probably like 11:30 and my assignments due at 11:59, and I don&#8217;t know what else to do.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another student had gotten in trouble at school for allegedly plagiarizing from ChatGPT — although he insisted he did not use it or any other AI tool. In his telling, he simply was not an exceptional writer. Because of that incident, however, that student now feels he “has to use ChatGPT, in order to make his writing seem more human.” This tracks with reports elsewhere of how fear of being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/style/ai-chatgpt-turnitin-students-cheating.html">wrongly accused of using AI</a> is changing behavior and eroding trust between students and teachers.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Students feel like their teachers are using AI, and many report seeing their parents doing it at home or professors doing it in the classroom.&nbsp; It can feel hypocritical and unfair to be punished for using AI for their work when the adults in their lives are doing it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another focus group student shared that she had been accused of using AI, and that a subsequent investigation concluded that she did not. However, she saw it as a “reputation hit” at school, because all her teachers could see a misconduct allegation related to AI in her record, even though the case was ultimately ruled in her favor.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of our conclusions is that teachers and students may not see eye-to-eye on which uses of AI count as cheating. We heard some students say that they use AI because their teacher encouraged it — as a way to generate computer code quickly or to get started on ideas for writing projects —&nbsp;so there are mixed messages about whether it is acceptable to use. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is consistent with a study of over 1,400 teachers, in which my colleagues Ruishi Chen, Monica Lee, and I found that only 10 percent of high school teachers had set <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-025-13350-w">explicit policies about AI in their classes</a>. It gets complicated quickly, considering districts are <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/schools-are-taking-too-long-to-craft-ai-policy-why-thats-a-problem/2024/02">still figuring out what policies make sense</a> and are equitable. They are aware that for some classes, AI use may seem like a helpful tool to allow. That leaves a lot of room for <a href="https://digitalpromise.org/2025/07/21/hearing-from-students-how-learners-experience-ai-in-education/">uncertainty or ambiguity for students</a> to navigate. If no one is clearly helping to clarify what is or is not acceptable, should we be surprised by these numbers?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, we can still feel alarmed that 10 percent to 15 percent of students are submitting fully AI-generated writing. In a class of 30 students, this means an average of four or five students would submit work <em>completely</em> done by AI. Those same students also may be doing it multiple times too. </p>
<div class="create-charts-and-maps-with-datawrapper-embed"><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/xeqEo/?v=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Link</a></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the portrait now for high schools, but based on the earlier studies of college cheating behaviors, we can expect similar results for colleges. Cheating has long happened and will continue to happen there too. At the same time,&nbsp;college students are often a self-selected population, their course structures and formats can be very different, and the students there are often facing a different set of stressors than the high schoolers. The numbers are likely high — maybe even higher, as the reasons students feel more emboldened to use AI in college are going to be a little different.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that these behaviors have been going on for a while, just without AI as the tool of choice, this invites us to think about why AI use specifically bothers us so much.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does student AI use mean for schools?</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Our current education system — and the assignments, tests, and essays that are part of it — were never designed with generative AI in mind. We have longstanding assumptions that our writing and other academic products are the product of intensive labor, and school was the training center. The value of our intellectual products were largely defined by the presumption that someone’s intensive labor was involved. Now, that <a href="https://www.edweek.org/technology/opinion-the-ai-cheating-crisis-education-needs-its-anti-doping-movement/2024/02">labor is being removed</a> from the equation.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We may think that decreasing mental labor demands in school is just a bad idea. A growing fear is that students who use AI all the time for school will lose their critical thinking capabilities. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872v1">One recent study</a>, out of MIT and reported in pre-print form, showed that people who composed writing with AI had less coupling of brain activity between key brain regions and less recall of what they had written than those who were not allowed to use AI.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While that sounds alarming, there is important fine print. The tasks the participants did in that study were fairly artificial in nature — everyone had to write in a strict window of 20 minutes, the participants were Boston-area adults, and there wasn’t an expectation when they began the experiment that they would be expected to quote what they wrote as a sign of recall. (For some perspective, this article — as an example of a real-life writing task — has definitely taken me more than 20 minutes to write.) Still, among those who fear AI will degrade critical thinking, this study is the new bogeyman.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One response to this shift is to preserve the status quo. We may try to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/01/18/chatgpt-in-schools-heres-where-its-banned-and-how-it-could-potentially-help-students/">ban or restrict AI use in schools</a>. We may end up deciding that AI is inappropriate for certain ages and want legislation or schools to help support us in that position. Research still needs to be done on the influence of AI in childhood, and we do not really know if such restriction policies will actually work. Students whose access to technology is restricted in school have a track record of getting access to it <a href="http://how-students-are-dodging-cellphone-restrictions">anyway</a>. Colleges have an especially hard time creating and enforcing these restrictions, with high-speed internet built into the campus infrastructure and the assumption that everyone is expected to use some technology for school.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another response is to accept that AI is here to stay and that new mental skills in a world of AI — such as knowing when to strategically choose automation or evaluating trustworthiness of information from AI — should be expected and taught. Similarly, AI optimists say that the skills tested in the MIT study, like recalling the phrases used in some earlier piece of writing, are not the mental labor that will be needed in an age of AI. That would mean overhauling classroom instruction. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But any teacher or curriculum developer will tell you that preparing a high-quality lesson for a new topic is a lot of work, as is preparing the associated assignments, grading rubrics, and tests. When we hear that everything needs to change, we are also making a call for teachers to accept more labor above and beyond what they are already expending now. In a climate where <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2024/beyond-bls/the-decline-of-the-teaching-profession.htm">interest</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/the-status-of-the-teaching-profession-is-at-a-50-year-low-what-can-we-do-about-it/2022/11">status</a> for the teaching profession is hitting new lows and education infrastructure is <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-may-soon-defy-congress-and-cut-5-billion-more-from-schools/2025/06">under threat</a>, this may not feel like the message educators need to hear, especially if we do not give the time, resources, and support (which costs money) to help them do this work well.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;Ultimately, it seems we are unlikely to eliminate AI — and the new skills it demands — from our entire lives.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Four questions for the future</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;AI did not unleash cheating on schools that were otherwise free of such behaviors. Rather, AI is taking its place as one more route for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Having done many consulting sessions and group discussions with teachers and district leaders, these are the questions that I think are key to think about moving forward:&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Why are students cheating? </strong></h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the schoolwork feels too high-stakes or there is so much going on in students’ lives that cheating is the best choice, we need to address stress and time management. One high school teacher shared that his school discovered that different teachers were putting all their big tests at the same time of the school year, creating intense high-stress weeks for the students. Pre-planning and spreading things out helped. If a college student feels they are one of hundreds of students in a required class unrelated to their interests, we have an opportunity to really think about the curriculum we require and the manner in which courses are taught.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) Are educators practicing what they are preaching? </h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Students feel like their teachers are using AI, and many report seeing their parents doing it at home or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/technology/chatgpt-college-professors.html">professors doing it in the classroom</a>.&nbsp;It can feel hypocritical and unfair to be punished for using AI for their work when the adults in their lives are doing it. With so much buzz about how important it is to know how to use AI in the future, we need to consider that many students are feeling arbitrarily deprived of the experiences and training that they think they most need and already see being used around them.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Have we clearly communicated what is and is not acceptable academic behavior, and why? </h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A common complaint from students is that they do not know what is permissible with AI. They may be having a hard time distinguishing between why it is less acceptable to have AI make edits to major points in a paper compared to having AI auto-fix spelling and grammar. Different teachers are establishing different rules, which complicates things further.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) What is important for students to know as they face a future filled with AI?</h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Calculators have been debated for decades in math classes because we wanted everyone to know how to do the calculations manually. But now, with mobile phones in so many pockets and handbags, we all have calculators with us all the time. Some algorithms that were essential before the calculator age may not be as important for everyone to know now. Similarly, the five-paragraph essay might be a relic ready to sunset.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, we all need to be working together to figure out what education and responsible AI use looks like in the future. We may feel like we are in panic mode, but it can be a good exercise to look at the past and see how we have responded to new technology developments in their early years. People feared that television would turn people into mindless vegetables, and that video games would cause violence. Now, these are part of our daily lives and represent complex and formidable industries that demand new talents and skills in their own rights. We can entertain the possibility that AI could be going a similar route in that regard.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At a minimum, we can all start by reading beyond shock headlines about cheating, looking to what the research says as the situation unfolds, and focusing on having good conversations with students and teachers about AI, schooling, and our expectations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is impossible, I think, to grasp the terrible consequences of Charlie Kirk’s death without understanding who he was in life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberals had a dim view of that track record —&nbsp;focusing on his often-offensive radio broadcasts and contributions to President Donald Trump’s authoritarian project (like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/461408/charlie-kirk-shooting-killed-right-way-suspect">sending seven buses</a> to the January 6 protest). However, to conservatives, he was something very different: not just an effective political organizer but a living symbol of democratic politics done the right way.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I must admit that this second perspective doesn’t come naturally to me. But I wanted to understand it better, so I reached out to Tanner Greer, a conservative author and essayist who had written brilliantly about what Kirk meant to the right on his blog <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/">the Scholar’s Stage</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://scholars-stage.org/bullets-and-ballots-the-legacy-of-charlie-kirk/">his piece</a>, Greer argues that Kirk was “the indispensable man” on the populist right: Nobody else had his genius for organization or his extensive connections with nearly everyone of note in the MAGA movement. On an ideological level, per Greer, Kirk represented a vision of politics in which the populist right competes on the left’s turf, from universities to elections, and wins in direct political combat. In this, he stood <em>against</em> MAGA’s most radical anti-democratic voices.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So when he was killed, Greer explains, his many friends and allies saw it as proof that the broader left was now incapable of coexisting with even someone as genial and small-d democratic as Kirk — giving rise to the vehement, even authoritarian, response of people like Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance. Now, much of the right believes it’s their turn to seize control of culture, to have a version of the left’s “George Floyd moment” of 2020.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I didn’t agree with much of the thinking Greer described. But I found his explanation of it, to borrow a phrase, “indispensable.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He helped me understand why leading Republicans blame an ill-defined “they” for Kirk’s killing, rather than a shooter who seemingly acted alone, and just how emotional these conservatives must be in the wake of Kirk’s passing. If we are to keep sharing a country, you need to understand this perspective — perhaps especially if you disagree with it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What follows is a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Tell me what you think most people who only knew Kirk from his radio broadcasts missed about him.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Second only to Donald Trump himself, Kirk is probably the most important individual in creating the current intellectual and organizational landscape of the MAGA movement. You wouldn&#8217;t get any of this at all if all you knew of him was some guy who&#8217;s willing to say shocking things on the internet.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the piece, I suggest there&#8217;s [several] aspects of Charlie Kirk that made him a very powerful individual.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the size of his audience. His radio show had about 500,000 people who listened to it. His TikTok channel had 7 million followers. He&#8217;s had campus debates that had upwards of 2 billion views in total all across the world. Five million Twitter followers on top of that.&nbsp;So he had this giant megaphone. If he wanted to come out and publicly take a position, Republicans would listen.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The second thing that he had was TPUSA and the little organizations that were built off of it. TPUSA is a very large, 850- to 900-chapter organization. This is a mass mobilization machine. This is a mass talent-building machine, as future political leaders often come from people who were TPUSA chapter leaders in their universities. And then on top of that, he builds these other outreach organizations. He has a giant outreach organization for evangelical church leaders.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then he has a vote-getting machine that is very active in swing states in the 2024 election — most Republicans seem to think that TPUSA&#8217;s Turning Point Action Committee might&#8217;ve gotten 10 to 20,000 votes in Arizona, which is basically the margin of a [close] election. They had perfected the strategy of basically primarying people for not being MAGA enough in Arizona, which is TPUSA’s organizational home, and they were going to go state to state to state in the near future.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2167287751.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Charlie Kirk during a Trump campaign rally" title="Charlie Kirk during a Trump campaign rally" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk speaks during a campaign rally for then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at Desert Diamond Arena on August 23, 2024, in Glendale, Arizona. | Rebecca Noble/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Rebecca Noble/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Your third source of power is that he&#8217;s this connector.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donors love him. He&#8217;s famously charismatic. Because he himself had kind of raised up this whole generation of new activists, he knew who was the best potential staffers or the best potential state House candidates or congressional candidates. There are several congressional candidates who came from TPUSA and are in Congress right now. And because he was running this podcast where he&#8217;s talking to the existing class of staffers, the existing media magnates, the existing politicians, he&#8217;s at the center of this network of people. And this is probably one of his most important roles in the right, especially the more MAGA right. He was constantly working to get people from one part or one of these constituencies to meet them with somebody else.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You wrote,</strong> <strong>“There are a good four dozen people in the Trump administration who owe their appointments to an introduction Kirk made on their behalf. And this was not only true of the Trump administration, but also across Congress and state governments and in news agencies like Fox News.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a guesstimate. The number might be underestimated —&nbsp;because Kirk was involved in a very personal way in vetting for this administration&#8217;s appointments.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You have to understand the right has a problem: We have a much smaller talent pool than the left. And if you are restricting it even further, if you need to restrict your talent pool to people who are more MAGA —&nbsp;people [who] can pass a Laura Loomer test — then you have an even smaller number of potential people. And so Kirk basically spends all the months of November and December and January, every day, meeting with [then-White House personnel director] Sergio Gor, talking about, “Here&#8217;s somebody who might be good for this position, here&#8217;s somebody who shouldn&#8217;t be in that position.” And he wasn&#8217;t the only one doing that, but he was a big part of getting people in the door and keeping some people out.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But this isn&#8217;t just true for little [roles]. This is true for Cabinet members. JD Vance is there because of Charlie Kirk.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During [2016], Charlie Kirk took a three-month break from TPUSA to basically be Don Jr.’s manager. And Kirk sends a text to Don and says [something like], “I know that this guy [Vance] said these things about how Trump was Hitler back in the time, but he&#8217;s had a conversion. He&#8217;s one of us now. You need to meet with him. You need to take him seriously. You need to introduce him to your dad.&#8221; </p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><br>“Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable.”</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s how JD Vance got in with cahoots with Trump in the first place, just because of Charlie Kirk. If you listen to the Charlie Kirk radio show that JD Vance hosted, he mentions this story. And almost every single person they had from the administration come on has a very similar story. There&#8217;s half a dozen Cabinet-level or people just below that who can say, &#8220;Kirk advocated for me to have this position, and that helped tip the balance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You can hear that not just in what they said, but the way in which they said it, in the obvious pathos and emotionality that came across in the discussions of Kirk during that radio broadcast or during the funeral on Sunday night. They all say that they genuinely cared for Kirk.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Part of me thinks, “Well, everybody on the right wants to have been close to him now.” But listening to you talk and listening to some of the stories people tell, I think this is just actually true: that he really did mean a lot to a lot of the people that are in power right now. And so part of this vehement political reaction to Kirk’s death is born out of this deep emotional and personal connection with him.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that&#8217;s correct. If you look at the MAGA movement as a whole, Kirk was a lot of people&#8217;s friend. That&#8217;s why all these donors are able to give him so much money. He was very good at being very optimistic and being like, “We&#8217;re going to win, we can do this,” cheering people up.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This position at the center of the MAGA world network —&nbsp;in addition to these kind of institutional things that he built up, the big megaphone he had, his ability to basically leverage all of that into helping other people make connections —&nbsp;made him sort of an indispensable pillar of the movement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So when he was shot, that was really not just an attack on somebody who says very controversial things. This is a person who helped pioneer [not only] the message, but also the institutions and the organizational networks of the current version of the right. And he did it by the time he was 31. An immensely talented individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>One thing that&#8217;s also struck me in the responses and the way that these figures talk about Kirk&#8217;s death is the omnipresence of the word “they.” It&#8217;s “they” killed Charlie, “they” took Charlie from us, even though there&#8217;s no evidence that the shooter was in any kind of conspiracy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what do people on the right mean by “they?”</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When George Floyd died in 2020, there was not a sense that this was the action of a single policeman, and if we put him in jail, then the problem&#8217;s over. There was rather a sense that you could only have a person like this policeman, who&#8217;s willing to stand on the neck of a Black man he&#8217;s just arrested until he dies —&nbsp;this could only happen if you have a larger systemic problem in America.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think many, many people on the right want to have their own version of the 2020 moment, partially because their analysis is very structurally similar to how leftists thought about racism in 2020. They think there&#8217;s larger structural problems —&nbsp;that [the shooter] only can exist because of a larger culture that supports his conduct, excuses it, and allows it to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">All these people went through 2020 and they want to have a similar reckoning, because that was experienced by the right as a very harrowing event — where essentially every single institution in the United States, every university, every provost, most corporations all gave out statements talking about how what happened was an act of evil and we need to nationally atone for the sin. If you didn&#8217;t agree with that stuff, this felt very oppressive to you, like you were being chased out of the public sphere.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think this is the easiest way to make sense of why some people on the right feel very strongly that we need to do things like, say, take <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/462570/jimmy-kimmel-trump-abc-disney-boycott-hulu-show-kirk-sinclair-nexstar">Jimmy Kimmel off the air</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would&#8217;ve been taken off the air without the state. And we don&#8217;t have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Help me understand that comparison a little bit more. In the George Floyd scenario, it’s pretty easy to see what the structural roots of Derek Chauvin’s actions are — a policing sector, and a society more broadly, shot through with racism.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But in the Kirk case, what’s the equivalent&nbsp;force that created Kirk’s killer? Is it left-wing animosity toward conservatism? Is it mainstream liberal ideology? What is the thing that the violence against Kirk is supposed to be an outgrowth of? Who specifically are “they” that embody whatever the structure is?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This “they” will differ from person to person. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a consensus. The possible options for “they” range from, at the narrowest, the kind of antifa people who are willing to use or at least endorse violence on the left. [At the broadest], it’s all the way to a [liberal] culture that sees Trump as inherently illegitimate and un-American and [as someone who] should be deplatformed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just to give you an example: Somebody was making a big deal out of a tweet that Vice President Harris had written in 2019, saying how basically, if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves, Trump should be kicked off Twitter by now because of his bad comments. That was cited as an example of the left&#8217;s inherent desire to kick us out of public spaces. Very similar to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/09/10/493427601/hillary-clintons-basket-of-deplorables-in-full-context-of-this-ugly-campaign">when Hillary Clinton says</a>, &#8220;[Half of] Trump supporters are a basket of deplorables.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you&#8217;re dehumanizing us, if you&#8217;re calling us deplorable, you&#8217;re basically saying we&#8217;re outside of the pale of American politics — then you are part of the “they” who basically dehumanizes someone like Kirk enough that he should be killed. I think that&#8217;s how they would say it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I&#8217;m not trying to weigh in with my own opinions on this. I just want to understand better what is this “they”? Because to me, it seems analytically incoherent. JD Vance, for example, has brought up the Open Society Foundation, which in no plausible world had anything to do with Charlie Kirk&#8217;s death. But it was one of Vance’s political enemies.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many actors on the right have for many years believed — and I have a lot of sympathies with this set of beliefs — that a lot of what the left has been about for the last decade, since the Great Awokening started, is basically making it difficult for conservatives to be part of the public sphere in a safe and confident way.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that word “safe” is interesting because when you start talking about safety, you can start roping in several different streams, which I don&#8217;t think liberals would necessarily associate with each other, into one system. This allows you to say, okay, people being deplatformed on campuses, that&#8217;s one version of us not being able to participate publicly. All the way to the riots in 2020, which a lot of conservatives felt Democratic cities and the sitting government allowed — which made it impossible for a person like me to be in these urban spaces for X amount of time. They made these cities too dangerous for us to be in.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that&#8217;s where people will do this kind of mining, where, okay, [liberal philanthropist George] Soros funded this Black Lives Matter-adjacent organization, which was making excuses for rioters here. That&#8217;s where they&#8217;ll kind of all connect that together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Someone like you, you&#8217;ll look at that and say, “Well, what does that have to do with Charlie Kirk being assassinated by this [lone wolf]?” And I think a lot of people on the right will say, “No, no, no, this is a large systemic thing. All you guys excused the violence in 2020, excused antifa, excused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/11/chaz-seattle-autonomous-zone-police-protest">taking over CHAZ</a>, excused all this stuff because you normatively agreed with it and thought that Trump was bad enough that that this sort of violence was okay. And that&#8217;s the same attitude, that&#8217;s the same world that creates young guys who want to go and shoot one of our most prominent leaders.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that&#8217;s how they would connect those dots.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Now, how does that attitude relate to something you talk about in the article at length, which is Kirk&#8217;s role in giving young conservatives permission to be themselves publicly in places like a university?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This question of what he meant to the young conservatives is quite relevant to this larger question: What is the “they”?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The way I explain it in this piece —&nbsp;this is really hard for liberals to believe —&nbsp;is that, if you were a young conservative on campus from 2013 to 2022, you felt afraid. Even when Trump was in power, a lot of these conservatives felt afraid. And this fear is really core to a lot of what has happened, I mean, really in this administration as well as people&#8217;s reactions to Kirk&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you were a young person on the right —&nbsp;you believe something like transgenderism is a lie or a mental disease, which is a pretty standard belief on the right — you were afraid to say what you believed because you felt like you would be socially ostracized, people on campus would bully you, harass you, treat you differently, you would have professors who might grade you differently, you wouldn&#8217;t have good job prospects, you would be afraid of becoming a viral example.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the environment in which TPUSA begins its giant rise. And Kirk&#8217;s campus tours, the sort of thing he was doing when he was shot, this is actually what they&#8217;re designed to combat. Yes, they created some viral clips, but that really was not their main purpose. Because Kirk was a campus activist first, a media figure second.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2236161830.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0062492188476426,100,99.987501562305" alt="A young person raises their hands while singing at the crowded memorial" title="A young person raises their hands while singing at the crowded memorial" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A mourner during a memorial service for Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on September 21, 2025. | Rebecca Noble/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Rebecca Noble/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The purpose of these was for Kirk to go into these universities and say, “Hey, guys, look, we can be part of the public sphere. There are more of you than it seems. You guys are all afraid to stand up and show you&#8217;re conservative. I&#8217;m going to come here, I&#8217;m going to organize a TPUSA chapter, and you&#8217;re going to see that you&#8217;re not alone. Second, I&#8217;m going to go and debate all these people around you, anyone who wants to come up. A professor, a student, anyone who wants to can come and debate me. And I can show you guys that these beliefs we have are defendable. We can stand up, we can be part of the public sphere.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And so there&#8217;s a lot of young conservatives who basically say, “Charlie Kirk made me unafraid to be an activist. Charlie Kirk is the one who made me unafraid to stand up for what I believed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Without someone like Charlie, the only people who would stand up for their conservative beliefs tended to be either extremely principled people or they were just assholes who like to be disagreeable. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve probably met both of those sorts when you were in college. If you want to have a movement that isn&#8217;t just people like that, you have to find some way to inspire people to stand up. And that&#8217;s what Kirk was doing. He&#8217;s modeling to all these kids, look, you guys can do this too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And that&#8217;s who was murdered. And so when the guy whose whole message is “you don&#8217;t have to be afraid” is shot, then it makes some sense why people might be feeling afraid.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>That&#8217;s where I wanted to bring us to at the end: how both sides should feel about their enemies.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I have this fear, given Kirk&#8217;s personal significance, that the right’s authoritarian reaction to his death is not going to be a short-lived thing — you may disagree. But if Charlie Kirk was trying to create a politics where people who disagree could engage, the aftermath of his death is destroying that possibility. It&#8217;s making it very, very, very difficult for people across partisan lines to view each other with anything but mistrust and suspicion.</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So what are we supposed to do about that?</strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think there&#8217;s a little bit of a crossroads here. I think the right has to decide whether Kirk’s life or his death is the thing that should be remembered.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that Kirk&#8217;s life, although many aspects of it are very repellent to people on the left, is an example of how this conservative national populist thing can be done without authoritarian measures and be very popular. I personally am on the side of saying, “Guys, look, Kirk actually showed us the path for how to make this work, and we&#8217;d be stupid if we left it for something that we don&#8217;t know if it will work.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">What I&#8217;ve been telling people on the right is, if you seriously believe you&#8217;re going to have a 2020 moment, you guys are somewhat deluding yourselves. Because 2020 had very many special things that led up to it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously, you had a pandemic, everyone was cooped in their house and wanted to get out and be out. But in addition to that, you had years of activism. Black Lives Matter started seven years before 2020. And the New York Times had basically doubled its reporting on racism and racial problems in America in the three years that preceded 2020.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You had a huge amount of intellectual work being done. You had a huge amount of activism being done. And in many ways, 2020 was the culmination of a decade&#8217;s worth of theorizing and activism and changing public opinion. So I don&#8217;t think this attempt to use the state to have a 2020 moment is going to work. I just don&#8217;t think the public is there: I think it&#8217;s going to backfire.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And I understand, too, that certain people have a bad opinion of Kirk. But I do think that the impulse of some on the left to take this moment to say, “Well, Charlie Kirk was just this terrible person in all these ways, he said this terrible and that terrible thing, and we&#8217;re being censored if we don&#8217;t see otherwise” —&nbsp;to put it very frankly, lots of people on the [more radical] right are very happy to see those takes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate the right has been having for a long time is, “Do we think that the other side can live with us? How much of a threat really are they to us?” And so when the reaction of some people is to condemn the violence, but then talk about how actually it&#8217;s good that he&#8217;s gone, which is more or less what these people do, it sounds more like you are part of this structure of ideas that makes it acceptable for right-wing people to be killed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of people, a lot of politicians, understand this and have gone out of their way not to be inflammatory on all this. I think clearly this is what [former Vox co-founder and now New York Times columnist] Ezra Klein was thinking when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html">wrote that editorial</a>. But he got dragged through the mud for that, and he really had to justify himself showing up, talking to people on the right.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe it&#8217;s helpful if folks on the left don&#8217;t just discount Kirk as that terrible racist who says all these terrible things. If that&#8217;s the message you took away from all this, I think you&#8217;ll really misunderstand both what Kirk meant to the movement, but also what his death means to the movement as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joe Nucci, like many brand-new therapists, loved showing off his fancy new psychology vocabulary during grad school. All these diagnoses and concepts were exciting, Nucci says, and helped explain so much. But as he continued his schooling, he realized that applying those terms in everyday life could be perilous.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some self-help creators online could use a bit of that wisdom. As the stigma surrounding mental health has waned over the last 10 years, an influx of well-meaning influencers and consumers looking to understand more about themselves may have bought into flattened descriptions of popular terms — like <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23769973/limits-therapy-speak-narcissist-gaslighting-trauma-toxic">boundaries or narcissism</a> — or have <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24140293/anxiety-catchall-unpleasant-emotion-emotional-intelligence-mental-health">internalized simplistic ideas about their emotions</a>. “I was noticing that not only was some of it just technically incorrect, but it was being explained or applied in a way that ultimately was harmful,” Nucci says. “If people were taking that advice too literally or without the important missing nuance, it could lead to decisions that would actually hurt mental health and not help it.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So Nucci, a licensed psychotherapist in private practice with over 250,000 followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joenuccitherapy">Instagram</a>, set out to dispel some of those myths — to correct the therapy-speak that has come to dominate mental health. In <a href="https://joenuccitherapy.com/psychobabble-viral-mental-health-myths-the-truths-to-set-you-free/"><em>Psychobabble: Viral Mental Health Myths and the Truths to Set You Free</em></a>, Nucci outlines over three dozen misconceptions that have rampantly circulated online. Here, he discusses seven of the most pervasive, how we got here, and how to fight back.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Your diagnosis explains who you are</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade or so, Nucci has noticed discussions around diagnoses morph from “You have X disorder” and “You are so much more than a label” to “almost a personality feature,” he says. Diagnoses are best utilized to inform a treatment plan to promote better functioning, Nucci says. But when people wear their diagnoses like a label, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Those with ADHD, for example, may run late because they are distracted, he explains. “With the right medication, with the right mindset shifts, with the right coaching and executive functioning training, you can actually minimize how often you run late and to the point where you&#8217;re not running late any more than the typical person,” he says. But if you believe running late is an unchangeable facet of your personality, you may make the symptoms worse and close yourself off to improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of relying on one term to define yourself, Nucci suggests highlighting many of your qualities using a variety of words: creative, outgoing, scatterbrained at times. “We need to be using more language,” he says, “not less.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You’re a people pleaser&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nucci takes issue with the term “people pleaser” because it isn’t specific and could refer to any number of behaviors. “Are you going along with things and then elevating your sense of moral superiority?” he says. “Are you self-sacrificing for one reason or another?” Some people may just be more agreeable than others and take pleasure when deferring to loved ones.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So-called people pleasing becomes problematic when it’s motivated by conflict aversion — you’re afraid of upsetting a friend so you don’t voice your opinion even when you want to. In his own life, Nucci has been working on standing his ground and trying not to assume others are&nbsp;mad at him — he’s been open with friends and family about it. “People, overall, were really supportive,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: Your date is a love bomber</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Like many pop psychology-related concepts, the widely accepted definition of “love bombing” has shifted. Originally intended to refer to a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201703/the-danger-of-manipulative-love-bombing-in-a-relationship">manipulation tactic</a> where love and affection are used to control another person, the understanding of love bombing tends to point to any relationship that’s progressing quickly. “There are so many reasons why people move fast in dating,” Nucci says: lust, infatuation, falling for an idea of a person, confused expectations.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean they’re attempting to manipulate their romantic partner.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other popular mental health-related terms have also followed a similar trajectory: think about the social media posts you’ve seen referring to people as “toxic” or “narcissists.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As for love bombing, just because someone has intense feelings early in a relationship doesn’t necessarily mean they’re attempting to manipulate their romantic partner. Nor does taking a pause to slow things down if you’re considering whether to continue dating after the initial infatuation has worn off.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You’re powerless to solve your problems&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Inspired by a metaphor he often saw online — “A flower isn&#8217;t doing well. Do you blame the flower, or do you blame the quality of the soil, the air, the sunlight?” — Nucci believes both systemic societal issues and personal autonomy play a role in mental health. Racism, sexism, discrimination, and any number of systemic issues have certainly impacted his patients, Nucci says, but it’s important for mental health practitioners to remember their patients have agency, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, repeatedly reminding people of all the ways the world is unfair may prevent them from seeing a way forward. “If you&#8217;re on the really extreme end of prioritizing systemic justice,” Nucci says, “there&#8217;s going to be situations in which you could actually do something as an individual. You don&#8217;t want to be so rigid in that stance that you miss the easy wins of stuff you can do and stuff that you can work on.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, it is important to acknowledge external forces you can’t control. Being wholly committed to the idea that you can change your circumstances if you just work hard enough might only lead to burnout, exhaustion, and frustration. “You&#8217;re not actually advancing towards the goals that you value,” Nucci says. “Is it adaptive of you to take a step back, to take a deep breath and look at your context, look at the system that you&#8217;re in? Maybe that&#8217;s your family, maybe that&#8217;s your culture or country. … That can also be really, really healing.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You should learn as much about mental health as you can&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Becoming an amateur expert in mental health concepts doesn’t equate with healing, Nucci says. In therapy, counselors typically begin by helping patients name their experiences, process them, and analyze them, he explains. “Sometimes, when people are able to articulate a cogent analysis, their symptoms go away — not always, but sometimes,” Nucci says. “At that point you want to stop analyzing, because if you continue, it quickly becomes obsessing, ruminating.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In which case, learning more or digging deeper emotionally might not help. Instead, therapists could turn their approach to other forms of treatment, like cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on shifting thought patterns, or behavioral therapy, where you work on changing your actions. Suffice to say, endlessly trying to learn about mental health concepts and terminology online can also become counterproductive outside of a therapeutic environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You can never have enough emotional intimacy</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people differ in how open and vulnerable they expect their romantic relationships to be. Some want their significant other to be extremely expressive and raw; others might not be comfortable divulging everything to their spouse. You shouldn’t feel bad if you don’t want to tell your partner what you’d tell your therapist. “The type of intimacy that you would give your therapist, the types of details, the types of stuff you would talk about, I would not necessarily recommend speaking to your partner that way,” Nucci says.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The same goes for your children. Just because you’d confide in a friend about trauma from your past doesn’t mean it’s necessarily appropriate to disclose that to your kids.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Vulnerability is important in close relationships, but it doesn’t mean you have to be totally vulnerable with every person you meet. “Maybe only one person gets that vulnerability with you,” Nucci says. “Maybe it&#8217;s your partner, maybe it&#8217;s your therapist, maybe it&#8217;s a friend.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Myth: You need therapy if you want a relationship</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While therapists are certainly qualified to treat patients on their mental health journeys, they are not “wise sages” on all topics, Nucci says, especially love. Therapy can help you identify unhelpful patterns in relationships and give you skills to help fix them, but it won’t replace the experience of actually dating.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“You’ve got to learn to put yourself back out there, and that&#8217;s all any of us can do,” Nucci says. “If that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re struggling with, therapy can be a great intermediate support for you, but I think it&#8217;s inaccurate to say that it will make you completely ready.”</p>

Charlie Kirk has been turned into the first martyr of the MAGA faith.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Charlie Kirk has been turned into the first martyr of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/416042/religion-politics-trump-christian-nationalism-liberty-maga">the MAGA faith</a>. And this matters because it is martyr veneration that helped both Christianity and Islam transform from small local movements centered on charismatic preachers <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Witnesses_to_Faith/3n_P0Fztsn8C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0">into global religions</a>. In launching its own martyrs, MAGA may be moving from a movement focused on one beguiling leader in the person of Donald Trump to a broader faith that could outlast him.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the assassination, a variety of MAGA-foe pundits have compared the <a href="https://www.laprogressive.com/progressive-issues/charlie-kirk-echoes-horst-wessel">MAGA response to Kirk’s murder</a> — including Stephen Miller’s convenient claim that Kirk’s last message to him was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3806525/charlie-kirks-last-message-to-stephen-miller-dismantle-the-radical-left/">a call to “dismantle the radical Left”</a> — to the response to the killing of <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/11/2343074/-Is-Charlie-Kirk-MAGA-s-Horst-Wessel-Song-call-to-arms-with-poll">Horst Wessel</a>, a German Nazi murdered by two members of Communist Party of Germany in 1930. In the hands of Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Wessel’s death became a rallying cry, and Wessel himself a heroic martyr whose death symbolized the Nazi struggle against Communism. Goebbels had Wessel mythologized through songs, rallies, and public ceremonies, creating a cult around him that galvanized support for the Nazi movement.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The comparisons to Horst Wessel are not without merit. His death was a major boon for Nazi propaganda, just as Kirk’s death has given MAGA and the Trump administration proximate cause to escalate attacks on their political adversaries. But those comparisons miss something crucial. Goebbels himself was consciously drawing on an earlier model, and it is that model, <a href="https://uni-goettingen.de/en/martyrdom+in+late+antiquity/205597.html">the Late Antique cult of the martyrs</a>, that the MAGA faithful are now, consciously or not, also invoking.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Until now, the evangelical Christianity that Kirk embraced — and still the default mode of worship for American Christian nationalists — has had only a tenuous relationship with martyrdom. There have been powerful stories, to be sure: <a href="https://www.baptistpress.com/resource-library/news/cassie-bernalls-faith-at-gunpoint-reverberates-nationally-globally/">Cassie Bernall, the teenager at Columbine</a> who supposedly declared her faith before being shot, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/03/john-chau-christian-missionary-death-sentinelese">John Allen Chau, the young missionary</a> killed on North Sentinel Island. But these episodes are remembered as isolated moments of witness-inspiring stories of faith, rather than built into an ongoing culture of veneration as evidenced by the official support for the efforts to celebrate Kirk’s memory, including from the president of the United States. Evangelicals have often been suspicious of martyr-saints in part because this brand of martyr veneration smacks of “works” and Catholic hagiography rather than the Evangelical emphasis on personal salvation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That reluctance has been a weakness, because martyrs inspire the faithful, galvanize movements, and spread a message far more effectively than any sermon. After all, what better evidence of truth than that there were hundreds, nay thousands, prepared to die in witness to that truth? &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>As MAGA’s first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions’ martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, while it is now common to claim that Christians were relentlessly persecuted by the Roman Empire, in recent years this idea has been widely challenged. Scholars like <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-myth-of-persecution-candida-moss?variant=32206054129698">Candida Moss</a> have convincingly argued that while individual Christians were persecuted and occasionally killed for their beliefs, the idea of persistent and widespread persecution was largely an invention of Christians themselves. Researchers have argued that stories of Christian persecution were insidiously crafted not just to inspire the faithful, but also to silence and shame nonconformists and keep the churches funded.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In a similar vein, the MAGA movement, ever resourceful and idiosyncratic, has seemingly turned to the medieval Christian traditions, creating a martyr who would be at home in any sixth-century book or church. And as MAGA’s first martyr, the myth being crafted around Kirk both mirrors that of earlier religions’ martyrs while still bearing the unique marks of the MAGA faith, including the reshaping of the Pentecostal Kirk into a generic “Christian,” who really loved America, by the way.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to create a martyr</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On September 9, Kirk had been a member of the MAGA manosphere, a community college dropout who argued with college students. The co-founder and face of the conservative activist group Turning Point USA, Kirk entered the national political scene as a teenager. At that time, he was part of what was even then a dying breed of secular American conservative, and, at least publicly, did not show much interest at all in religion, except to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/charlie-kirk-turning-point-donald-trump-christian-nationalism-rcna156565">urge his fellow conservatives to respect the separation of church and state</a>. Then, in 2021, Kirk partnered with Rob McCoy, the senior pastor of Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Thousand Oaks, California, to found <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/pastor-rob-mccoy-charlie-kirks-190801887.html">TPUSA Faith</a>, a faith-based version of Turning Point. This was part of an increasingly religious tenor in Kirk’s public statements and views; however, on September 9, few would have thought of Kirk as primarily — or even particularly — a religious figure.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, the moment he was pronounced dead that began to change: Alongside <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/09/16/dont-shut-down-free-speech-in-charlie-kirks-name/">portrayals of Kirk</a> as a defender of free speech, there was the explicitly religious veneration and storytelling. All over the MAGA internet, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/unite-kingdom-rally-drew-millions-133000346.html">and even in reactionary circles abroad</a>, people said: Kirk was an evangelist, even a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1317843273399984">modern-day John the Baptist</a>. His death will be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/22/opinion/charlie-kirk-memorial-christianity.html">impetus for revival</a>. Mainstream media <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/09/14/charlie-kirk-christian-religious-beliefs-shaped-advocacy/86116403007/">repeated the claim that Kirk wanted Christianity</a> to be his legacy. And official White House social media, too, referred to his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1867299070516318">memorial as a “revival.”</a> The hagiography of Charlie Kirk had begun.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s especially clear that Kirk is being made into a martyr for the MAGA movement because he’s being celebrated as a generic “Christian.” In the process, his real religious background is blurred or even completely ignored. Kirk’s wife, Erika, is a Roman Catholic and Kirk has had nice things to say both about Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians. But make no mistake: Charlie Kirk himself, to the extent he had developed an adult religious identity over the past five years, <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/nov/24/in-california-charlie-kirks-pastor-sees-gods-hand-in-trumps-win/">was a Pentecostal</a>, a particularly<strong> </strong>evangelical brand of Christianity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet that hasn’t stopped both the reactionary American Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan from comparing Kirk to a “<a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/nov/24/in-california-charlie-kirks-pastor-sees-gods-hand-in-trumps-win/">modern-day St. Paul</a>.” Nor, most bizarrely of all, has it prevented Metropolitan Tikhon Shevkunov, an influential bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/09/22/putins-confessor-metropolitan-tikhon-hails-charlie-kirk-as-a-martyr-a90588">known as “Putin’s Confessor,”</a> from calling Kirk’s death “martyric” and declaring that Kirk “<a href="https://www.rt.com/news/624999-top-russian-orthodox-cleric-honors/">is truly effective in missionary work</a>.” On social media and message boards, traditionalist Catholics and Eastern Orthodox Christians <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOcO1-QjWt5/?hl=en">have declared with certainty</a> that Kirk would have converted to their favored church if only permitted to live a bit longer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gIyNhNP3mo">he was “interested” after all</a>, although he never gave any real indication of any pending conversion (and many <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOvbsY4Fado/">evangelical influencers have pushed back</a> against this idea). It is a blurring of lines Kirk might have approved of. He has an upcoming book advocating that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/09/15/charlie-kirks-books-and-podcasts-top-charts-following-assassination/">Christians adopt the Jewish practice</a> of keeping the Sabbath, putting him in a long line of <a href="https://ccj.org.uk/sites/ccj.hocext.co.uk/files/2023-03/CCJ%202023%20Explainer.pdf">evangelicals who co-opt Jewish practice</a> to their own ends.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflation of Kirk’s religious identity, both by him and his would-be hagiographers,&nbsp;makes most sense when placed within the larger story of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/416042/religion-politics-trump-christian-nationalism-liberty-maga">how MAGA is remaking religion itself</a>. For decades, the religious right sought to apply Christian scripture to American life; they were traditionalists, often theocrats, who wanted the law to conform to the church. But Trump’s new religious right reverses that relationship. In this movement, theology is bent to serve the nation, and churches exist to strengthen an America defined by nationalism, whiteness, and loyalty to Trump. The Religious Liberty Commission —&nbsp;packed not with the mainline Protestants that have dominated American religious life but with evangelicals, conservative Catholics, Orthodox Jews, and even Muslim converts — makes this explicit: It is not doctrine that binds them but a shared sense of cultural siege.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That is why Kirk’s memory works best for the movement if he is treated not as a Pentecostal, but as a generic “Christian” and specifically as a Christian whose Christian faith was explicitly tied to the MAGA cause. Theological specifics — once so divisive between Catholics, evangelicals, and Orthodox — matter far less than political utility. In a movement that builds theology to fit politics, Kirk can be cast as an evangelical evangelist, a Catholic saint, or even a hero for Russian Orthodoxy, because the point is not religious accuracy but political cohesion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">And frankly, the generalization of Kirk’s religious identity is only possible because he was part of the MAGA faithful and came to his faith that way. Thus, it was a “MAGA Christianity.” Take, for example, Kirk’s praise of the role of the <a href="https://thecatholicherald.com/article/charlie-kirk-was-close-to-becoming-a-catholic-as-he-meditated-on-virgin-mary-as-solution-to-toxic-feminism">Virgin Mary in Catholicism</a>, which Catholics and Orthodox have cited as proof he would have eventually joined them. Kirk had not come to believe in the intercessory powers of Mary or been bowled over by the countless Marian miracles that dot the history of Christianity. No, Kirk thought the veneration of Mary was an antidote to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzUBMlqF1tA">toxic feminism</a>,” teasing in his noncommittal way it might even be enough to make him convert.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Medieval at the memorial</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Oddly, those social media commentators desperate to be Kirk’s co-religionists might be on to something. On the surface, the memorial for Kirk on Sunday in Arizona has largely <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/22/nx-s1-5549402/charlie-kirk-evangelical-christian-worship-martyr">been noted for its evangelical character.</a> And it is true, the event had contemporary Christian worship music and plenty of pleas for people to “read their Bibles,” subtle hints to experience the personal conversion at the heart of evangelicalism. But these aspects of evangelical worship and theology have long found their way into other parts of Christianity. <a href="https://www.catholic.com/qa/the-catholic-charismatic-renewal">Charismatic Catholics exist</a>. And what took place at Kirk’s memorial, from the speeches to the memorabilia, was not simply evangelical enthusiasm. It echoed much older patterns, drawn straight out of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, eras that predate evangelicalism altogether.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, there is the much-discussed contrast between the speeches given by Erika Kirk and Donald Trump. As many progressive commentators have pointed out, Erika Kirk said she forgave her husband’s killer. She was followed by the president, who immediately called for revenge. Both drew applause from the crowd.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This may simply reflect an audience willing to cheer anything, but it also echoes the world of the medieval saint. In that world, the virtuous woman, often a virgin or widow, pleads for mercy and forgiveness for the saint’s persecutors, while the strong Christian king seeks vengeance. The idea was central to <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/queens-gold-and-intercession-the-case-of-eleanor-of-aquitaine/">medieval notions of queenship</a>. It is a model that allows the language of Christian mercy to coexist with the harsh realities of authoritarian rule, which is exactly what MAGA is aiming for. It was also a model that allowed for women to have a significant public role while not transgressing normative ideas of femininity. Say, for example, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/18/politics/erika-kirk-turning-point-ceo">Erika Kirk becoming the CEO of Turning Point USA</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, there’s the merch: hats, T-shirts, and cups sold bearing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/turning-point-usa-expands-its-merchandise-collection-items-commemorating-charlie-kirk">images of Kirk with a halo above his head</a> or walking hand in hand with Christ in paradise; these would find more home in medieval Catholicism than among idol-fearing Evangelicals. These are all part of medieval Christianity, a pre-evangelical way of making and celebrating a martyr. It is a way of celebrating the saints that the evangelicals of the MAGA faith have seemingly embraced, a part of Catholicism they have embraced despite the theological contradictions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The earliest Christians celebrated the Eucharist over the tombs of martyrs. To this day, the relics of saints are buried in the altars of Orthodox and Catholic churches. That is how central the cult of the martyrs was to the early Christian churches&#8217; self-understanding, even if most of the stories were simply made up. Today, the religious movement that is being built in America at this moment is as dangerous and unprecedented as its new politics. And, just like Christianity two millennia ago, this new MAGA faith is going to need martyrs for all the reasons Christianity did: to inspire the faithful, punish dissenters, and keep the money flowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Martyrs made Christianity more than a small sect that would soon die out like so many before and after it; they made it a religion, offering the movement the political tools to grow and consolidate. The MAGA movement has, consciously or not, learned from this history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Six months into Donald Trump&#8217;s second term, the “manosphere” — an ecosystem of right-leaning podcasts and YouTube shows that helped elect him — appears to be losing some of its enthusiasm for him.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these hosts, who appeal to a young, male, and politically disengaged audience, now seem less excited about the administration’s actions and focus. While some remain loyal, others are more critical or have shifted away from politics entirely. This fragmentation could pose a challenge for Trump, the MAGA movement, and the Republican Party in future elections as they try to hold together the unconventional coalition of voters that helped him win reelection.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-top-50-podcasts-in-the-u-s-for-q1-2025-from-edison-podcast-metrics/">tens of millions of listeners</a>, these podcasts have a <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2025/">significant reach</a>. They frequently top podcast charts and attract a large audience, particularly among men. Recent data shows that the share of podcast listeners who <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-evolving-demographics-of-podcast-listeners/">identify as Republican has been growing</a>, and millions more Americans have become regular podcast consumers, making these hosts’ shifts in loyalty and tone all the more important.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump’s loyal broadcasters</h2>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Full Send Podcast</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2.2 million subscribers (8.4 million on their</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nelkfilmz"><em>YouTube</em></a><em> prank channel); pranks, pop culture, and sports; weekly</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fratty young <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/canadian-pranksters-nelk-have-millions-of-young-followers-their-dangerous-decision-to-party-during-the/article_5b904c5e-e3c4-5ab0-ade4-54e6cb5a403a.html">Canadian and American</a> men of the <em>Full Send Podcast</em>, Kyle Forgeard and Aaron &#8220;Steiny&#8221; Steinberg, part of the prank group called the Nelk Boys, are two of Trump’s most loyal podcasters. The Nelk group began their media and entertainment business as party-boy influencers, known <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/canadian-pranksters-nelk-have-millions-of-young-followers-their-dangerous-decision-to-party-during-the/article_5b904c5e-e3c4-5ab0-ade4-54e6cb5a403a.html">as early as 2020</a> as “the most recognizable personalities for young people in North America,” when they gained notoriety for hosting parties during the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And they built on that brand of performative hypermasculinity, organizing “brotests” to reopen gyms, traveling across the US and essentially taking contrarianism as far as they could. One fan <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/canadian-pranksters-nelk-have-millions-of-young-followers-their-dangerous-decision-to-party-during-the/article_5b904c5e-e3c4-5ab0-ade4-54e6cb5a403a.html">told the Toronto Star</a> back in 2020 that “a large part of ‘Nelk’ is not listening” and not following rules.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That spirit brought them millions of followers, views, and financial success through partnerships, promotions, and subscriptions. And through their vlogging and prank videos, they have been able to mainstream and promote a variety of right-leaning and far-right commentators on their show, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/manosphere/how-nelk-boys-went-viral-pranksters-right-wing-media-stars">leading to accusations</a> of “extreme misogyny” and bigotry.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2185337311.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Kyle Forgeard smiles on a red carpet" title="Kyle Forgeard smiles on a red carpet" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The Nelk Boys’ Kyle Forgeard attends the 2024 PrizePicks World Championship at Pullman Yards
in Atlanta on November 17, 2024. | Paras Griffin/Getty Images for PrizePicks" data-portal-copyright="Paras Griffin/Getty Images for PrizePicks" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last few years, Forgeard and his collaborators have <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/youtube-donald-trump-nelk-boys-full-send-podcast-interview-1320041/">interviewed</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6So8DTFq0RFf67hTGsY2cu"> Trump</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2AzudK4Bars1p1mCGDs4RF"> repeatedly</a> and talked with him and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-re1pBdMD8I">JD Vance</a> during the 2024 campaign. Trump, in turn, has shouted the boys out in speeches and praised them and their work, noting in 2023 that many in the political and media establishment “don’t realize that the NELK boys are probably a lot more powerful than them.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since January, they’ve been more or less supportive of Trump — praising his foreign policy and negotiating over the Russia-Ukraine war. Still, more recently, they have said that they want “to maybe stay out of politics for a little bit because we just want to have fun, too,” after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/24/netanyahu-nelk-boys-podcast?utm_source=chatgpt.com">getting intense criticism</a> for interviewing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">PBD Podcast</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2.69 million subscribers; current events and business; two to three times each week</em></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hosted by businessman Patrick Bet-David in a panel-style discussion with three to four co-hosts, <em>PBD Podcast</em> tends to talk about all kinds of current events, ranging from celebrity news to hard politics. Trump has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dmwG54QsKc">appeared</a> on the show before, visiting Bet-David during the 2024 campaign, and Bet-David has called himself a staunch Trump ally.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the shows feature some debate over Trump’s policies, those conversations tend to end by criticizing Democrats and boosting the Trump stance. During the rollout of “Liberation Day” tariffs in spring, for example, the panel was torn and confused about the impact of tariffs on the global markets, before criticizing the Federal Reserve and endorsing Trump’s negotiations. Similarly, they have long praised Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, calling Trump an “alpha” male for his treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. And they show no signs of slowing their support soon.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The jaded or disappointed critics</h2>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The Joe Rogan Experience</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>20 million subscribers; interviews, commentary; about four times per week</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2194402282.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.031867431485026,100,99.93626513703" alt="Joe Rogan during the inauguration" title="Joe Rogan during the inauguration" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Media personality Joe Rogan, center left, during the 60th presidential inauguration in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt; | Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Saul Loeb/AFP/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest podcaster in the world <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/438944/joe-rogan-experience-podcast-america-mirror-2020s-politics-truth-young-men">wasn’t always</a> a Trump fan, but became one over the course of the last five years as his show became one of the most influential platforms for politicians, celebrities, thinkers, and more. Rogan’s October <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBMoPUAeLnY">Trump interview</a> broke <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-rogan-social-media-surge-trump-interview-1975885">records</a> (it’s been viewed 60 million times now) and kicked off a frenzy on the Democratic side when he didn’t agree to the terms set by Kamala Harris’s campaign to get her on the show.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last few months, however, Rogan’s support for Trump has been much more muted. He’s been critical of tariffs, government <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-rogan-trump-palestine-student-protest_n_68893085e4b07dfa117e4b72">censorship</a> and pseudo-policing language, the extent to which <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/rogan-says-voters-frustrated-because-expected-trumps-ice-raids-nab-gang-members-not-landscapers">mass deportations</a> are being carried out, and, more recently, the obfuscation over the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-rogan-slams-trump-claim-epstein-scandal-hoax_n_68a5e505e4b0d31656202e09">supposed Epstein Files</a> and the administration “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xCsQGI9p1M">gaslighting</a>” supporters. The podcaster sounds more jaded. As opposed to becoming a full-throated critic, he seems less enthusiastic about the president’s embrace of big tech CEOs, the lack of promised transparency by the administration on things like government spending, censorship, and the Epstein case. Instead, Rogan demonstrates disillusionment and disengagement.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">This Past Weekend With Theo Von</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>4.1 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; about twice a week</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2199791458.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Theo Von" title="Theo Von" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Theo Von attends “SNL50: The Homecoming Concert” at Radio City Music Hall on February 14, 2025, in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; | Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Theo Von, the comedian and host of <em>This Past Weekend</em>, has started to split with Trump more visibly over the Epstein episode. Von used to be a bigger Trump fan; he hosted Trump a year ago, when in the span of a week he talked to both Trump and Bernie Sanders, and this May, he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-theo-von-qatar-military-jokes-6cb21a321a1ed806577b84dfbf9ea9ab">delivered a stand-up set</a> during Trump’s visit to a Qatari American military base.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, Von seems to be a lot more skeptical of Trump this summer — criticizing his tariffs, America’s involvement in the Middle East by attacking Iran, American support for Israel and “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMvtbldNuUk/">helping</a>” support a “genocide in Gaza,” and the administration’s response to calls for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0oMuwGYgDM">transparency</a> on the Epstein case.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Von himself has started to host Trump critics, having on Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jiUhCKhpw">discuss</a> the Epstein case, and using social media to <a href="https://x.com/TheoVon/status/1945590466441081144?lang=en">criticize Vance</a> (a former guest of Von’s) for reneging on his promise to “release” the Epstein files. In more recent episodes of his show, Von sounds more muted about Trump — still hosting conversations with a variety of guests and telling jokes but also talking about how “corrupt” the “system” is, how nothing really seems to be changing, and how depressing politics is.</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Andrew Schulz’s Flagrant With Akaash Singh</h4>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>2 million subscribers; comedy and interviews; weekly</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/gettyimages-2217766222.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="Andrew Schulz" title="Andrew Schulz" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Andrew Schulz speaks onstage at a Netlfix comedy night at the Comedy Store on May 29, 2025, in West Hollywood, California.&lt;/p&gt; | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix" data-portal-copyright="Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for Netflix" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The host of the <em>Flagrant</em> comedy podcast, Andrew Schulz, is disillusioned with Trump, but much more vocally. Schulz was a big Trump supporter in the past, also hosting him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ry1IjOft95c">his show</a> in 2024. Schulz has now<strong> </strong>turned into Trump’s loudest former-fan-turned-critic in this universe. The sharp break came in July, during the Epstein debacle, when he began to express more regret for his Trump support, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/did-trump-betray-his-voters-feat-pod-save-america-ro-khanna/id1288641267?i=1000717378615">saying that</a>, “If I wanted to vote for somebody that was going to keep the Epstein files under wrap, that was going to extend the foreign wars and was going to increase the budget, I would have voted for Kamala.” And he is communicating a lot of what new 2024 Trump voters who weren’t huge supporters of the president have been saying in polling. “Everything he campaigned on I believe he wanted to do, and now he’s doing the exact opposite thing of every single fucking thing,” Schulz <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-trump-is-covering-for-epstein-how-diddy-got-off/id1288641267?i=1000716694325">said in July</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Schulz, like Von, has started to host more liberal and Trump-critical voices: Sanders, Khanna, Pete Buttigieg, the <em>Pod Save America</em> hosts, and the journalist Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder). He now teases himself for his past support for Trump and has essentially turned his show into a vehicle for those expressing regret over their Trump support to feel better about looking for other options.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As Schulz said recently, Democrats have an opportunity to win back voters like him. “You have an opportunity to be like, hey, we told you he was a liar. Here’s the proof that he’s a liar. Come over here, here are some ideas that might be better. You might like these. If you just go, hey, fuck you, you’re dumb, the people that are called dumb are never going to come to your side.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The apathetic or neutral voices</strong></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">A handful of podcasters and influencers have pulled back from discussing current events and politics, or if they delve into Trump-related topics, they do so carefully. Shawn Ryan (4.8 million subscribers) and Lex<strong> </strong>Fridman<strong> </strong>(4.79 million subscribers), for example, host interview shows that delve into hyper-specific and niche topics with guests who don’t talk too much about political news of the day, but they both conducted softball interviews with Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G80iLTctFuY">last</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCbfTN-caFI"> autumn</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Both have continued speaking with businessmen, authors, former military officers, historians, and thinkers since the election but have not been vocal defenders or commentators on Trump’s presidency so far. Fridman interviewed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but they only talked about Trump in passing for a few moments, and it was never critical. The same situation applies to Ryan, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrgmwtpAsWc">also interviewed Vance</a> last year, but hasn’t talked much about the Epstein debacle, tariffs, or immigration.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Two other big Trump supporters have pulled back from political discussions and promoting Trump. Adin Ross (4.6 million) and Logan Paul (4.8 million) both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s11uIW7wi-E">interviewed</a> Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrFdHO7FH8w">last year</a> but pivoted back to their original style of video livestreaming pranks, commentary on internet culture, and challenges (like Ross having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSbjUskLBA8">his back waxed</a> on a livestream with MrBeast).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The shifting loyalties within the manosphere could be a sign of broader changes among the young, male voters who helped elect Trump —&nbsp;the current tensions at least suggest early challenges to the durability of the president&#8217;s coalition. Still, it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration will actively work to win back the support of these creators and their audiences&nbsp;—&nbsp;he hasn’t returned to most of these shows since taking office.</p>
