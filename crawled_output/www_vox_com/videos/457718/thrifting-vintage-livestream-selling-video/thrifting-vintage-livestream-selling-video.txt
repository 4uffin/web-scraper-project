Dolly LiAug 12, 2025, 11:00 AM UTCShareGiftDolly Li is Lead Producer, Shortform Vertical Video, at Vox.The future of thrift and vintage reselling is rapidly evolving.Thrifting has taken off in the last decade, from secondhand fashion to vintage records, especially with younger consumers wanting to shop more sustainably, tap into nostalgia, and curate unique styles that reject algorithmic trends.However, with less foot traffic, high rent prices, and more people choosing to shop online rather than in-store, many brick-and-mortar businesses have been forced to change the way they reach their customers. Some have taken to listing their items on platforms like eBay or Depop, but an emerging group of vintage resellers are going a more active and rapid route: livestream selling. These small business owners have learned to pivot multiple times in their careers, and live shopping is just another avenue to help them connect more with their customers.We sat down with Chris Honetschlaeger (The Record Parlour), Janelle Adviento (@bleumi on Whatnot), Libby Rodney (The Harris Poll), and Darko Pavic (member of the Forbes Technology Council) to explore how livestream shopping could be the future of thrifting — especially for younger audiences — and the roadblocks to mass adaptation of this technology.Watch Vox’s latest to learn more, and subscribe to our channel on YouTube.This video is presented by Verizon Business.
