Dolly LiAug 28, 2025, 7:50 PM UTCShareDolly Li is Lead Producer, Shortform Vertical Video, at Vox.A third of the US population lives in wildfire risk zones. And fire season is only growing.Climate change, drier conditions, and the fact that many more people are moving into the wildland-urban interface (WUI) ‚Äî where human development meets heavily forested landscapes ‚Äî are three key factors. And in rural America, these fire-prone conditions are even more extreme.Wildfires are now happening year-round, and they‚Äôre taking a toll on firefighters, especially those who work in the wildlands of the western US. From exposure to carcinogens, long hours, and low wages, fire seasons are only getting longer as the wildland firefighter workforce faces more pressures than ever.In this video, we speak to first responders from all over rural America, including wildland firefighters, fire chiefs, and community advocates who shed light on how our fire ‚Äúseasons‚Äù are shifting, the ways that homeowners can protect themselves and their communities, especially if they live in WUI zones, and fire management strategies that firefighters have adopted from Indigenous communities.Thanks to our sponsor, T-Mobile: http://t-mobile.com/FirstResponders.
