Its main goal is to protect one of our most vulnerable populations: children, especially those under the age of 1. And it’s been wildly successful at doing just that. Diseases like polio or measles that, at one time, left children paralyzed, brain damaged, or even dead were eliminated in the United States.

Attitudes around vaccines are shifting, and the consequences of that are playing out in real time.In recent years, more and more parents are choosing to delay or even outright omit parts of the vaccine schedule. To be fair, it is a very overwhelming thing. There are 16 different diseases listed, some of them requiring up to five doses before a child hits 15 months.
