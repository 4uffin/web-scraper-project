Telehealth can help.by
Kim MasSep 15, 2025, 12:30 PM UTCShareGiftRural health care has been in crisis mode for decades, due to a wide range of issues from distance, to care, to provider shortages, and budget shortfalls. Rural residents may have to travel up to twice as far to access a hospital as those in urban areas. Staffing shortages mean that, even when they do arrive, they’re less likely to find the correct specialist. The American Medical Association reported that about 65 percent of rural areas have a shortage of primary care physicians. The list goes on, and despite multiple grants or special designations meant to help close these gaps, the issues persist. The reality is that rural areas need a range of options to better serve their communities. One that’s working right now is the use of telehealth to supplement care. The trouble is, telehealth is frequently overlooked and underfunded. But, if used correctly, proponents say it could be a game changer for rural communities — where about 20 percent of Americans live.Thanks to our sponsor T-Mobile: t-mobile.com/FirstResponders.
