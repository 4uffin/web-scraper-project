Train and serve a TensorFlow model with TensorFlow Serving
This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts, saves the trained model, and then serves it with TensorFlow Serving. The focus is on TensorFlow Serving, rather than the modeling and training in TensorFlow.
Intermediate
Create TFX pipelines hosted on Google Cloud
An introduction to TFX and Cloud AI Platform Pipelines to create your own machine learning pipelines on Google Cloud. Follow a typical ML development process, starting by examining the dataset, and ending up with a complete working pipeline.
Intermediate
Use TFX with TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference
Learn how TFX can create and evaluate machine learning models that will be deployed on-device. TFX now provides native support for TFLite, which makes it possible to perform highly efficient inference on mobile devices.
