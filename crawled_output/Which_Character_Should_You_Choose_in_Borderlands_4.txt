Since each vault hunter has three action skills, each with their own skill tree, there’s a pretty wide variety in terms of playstyles within each class. After some time with the game, we’ve broken down each Vault Hunter so you can decide who is best for you in Borderlands 4.

Vex - The Siren Overview Amon - The Forgeknight Overview Rafa - The Exo-Soldier Overview Harlowe - The Gravitar OverviewPlease note that this guide was written from the perspective of four different IGN staff members, as this allowed us adequate time to invest into each character, so we could provide the most comprehensive breakdowns possible.Which Vault Hunter Are You Playing as First?VexRafaAmonHarloweAnswerSee ResultsVex - The Siren OverviewVex is a lot of fun if you enjoy wreaking havoc and commanding units from a distance. At times, it felt like a lite version of an RTS since two of her trees focus on phantoms or creatures that fight alongside her.
Vex’s trait, Phase Covenant, attunes her action skill and melee damage to whatever element gun she’s using. It makes her uniquely adept at harnessing a variety of elemental damage types, and she can even apply a status effect when using kinetic weapons without elements.
Vex has two action skills that allow her to control other units on the field, and a third that condenses power into herself, if you’d rather not fuss with other creatures.
Speaking of skills, let’s take a closer look at Vex’s three skill trees and what they offer.
Dead Ringer - The Fourth Seal Skill TreeDead Ringer allows Vex to create clones of herself with various uses, like drawing enemy aggro or multiplying damage.
You can summon up to three clones, and they don’t have to be all at once, so you can only send them out when you need them.
There are two types of clones you can summon: Spectors, who can’t move but can shoot enemies, and Reapers, who are mobile, pull aggro, and use melee attacks.
The later augments and capstones in the tree give new skills or buffs to your various minions, like giving one of your Spectors Vex’s current gun, or spawning a much more powerful Grim Reaper. There’s also a unique capstone called Dark Pact that actually gives Vex two augment slots, as well as extra buffs to minions. If you want to feel like a battlefield commander, delegating death from a distance, Dead Ringer may be what you’re looking for.
Incarnate - Vexcalation Skill TreeRather than focusing on creatures or clones that Vex can summon, Incarnate focuses the power in Vex herself, becoming an incarnation of her abilities. She lets out a damaging Phase Explosion upon activation, gains various buffs when in this state, and the use of an offhand ability, Eldritch Blast. Unique to Vex is also the ability to apply Bleed as status effect damage while using kinetic weapons, meaning you’re not beholden to elemental guns, and there are useful passives that let you lean into that if you just can’t get the weapon drop you need.
Dealing gun damage reduces Eldritch Blast’s cooldown by a huge amount, even right from the beginning, so much of your Incarnation playstyle will be balancing firing off Eldritch Blasts with your offhand and shooting with the other.
What your Eldritch Blast actually does depends on your later Augments and Capstones, as it can restore shields, refill your ammo, ricochet, use your own health to increase its damage, or even create Damaging fields. If you want to focus all of Vex’s power on herself, this is the branch to take.
Phase Familiar - Here Comes Trouble Skill TreeWhen Vex has Phase Familiar equipped as her action skill, she’ll always have her familiar Trouble with her, even when not using the skill. Instead, Phase Familiar teleports Trouble to where you’re aiming while turning him into a Badass, and granting various effects.
You can buff his tankiness, his critical hit damage, or even turn him into a grenade. Trouble can die, putting his respawn on a cooldown timer, but using your action skill will revive him early.
Phase Familiar feels like Dead Ringer but with less micro-management, condensing all your different clones into one creature. You can also command him more directly, such as his aforementioned ability to explode. He can also Blink Strike an enemy or gain periods of invincibility. If you like the idea of commanding someone else to do your dirty work, but not having to keep track of several rotating clones, try out Phase Familiar.
Amon - The Forgeknight OverviewIf you’re the kind of player who likes to yell battle cries at the top of your lungs and charge in headfirst with your trusty shotgun at the ready, set a ton of things on fire (or freeze them to death), and would prefer your quips to be medieval flavored, well then, do we have the character for you.
Amon is Borderlands 4’s big, burly brawler with skills that bolster his close-range damage and survivability, and he even has an option to spec more into incendiary and cryo damage. Let’s take a look at his skills and get into the finer details.
Onslaughter - Calamity Skill TreeYou know the Vanguard class in Mass Effect 2? How they have that cool charge ability that lets them zoom towards an enemy and crash into them, dealing big damage while also putting you right into the fray? Well, Onslaughter lets you do basically the same thing.
Upon activation, Amon gains constant shield regeneration, bonus incendiary damage with guns, and increased movement speed. If you press the melee button while Onslaughter is active, your melee attack becomes a rocket punch that sends you flying towards an enemy for an explosive, high-damage punch.
You can augment the skill to basically use it as a immediate full health restore and make it so that each kill extends its duration, giving you more survivability; or if you’re already tanky and want to use that tankiness to boost your offense, you could go for the Thermal Diffusion augment, which grants bonus damage based on your max shield capacity, on top of also adding cryo damage to the attack.
Scourge - Vengeance Skill TreeIf you’re looking to play with a squad, the Vengeance Skill Tree is a great choice, as many of its skills are all about helping the team. The main attraction is the Scourge action skill, which lets you hold up a shield to absorb all damage from the front and turn into a resource called Vengeance. You can press the action button again to swing a flail that sends a wave of ice forward called a Forgewave, which deals more damage the more vengeance you have stored up.
This skill tree is also very Cryo damage forward, meaning if you have some really good Cryo damage guns, it might be worth a respec to make the best use of them. You can also do some very good damage with ordinances, like grenades or heavy weapons, by investing in skills such as Scorched Kairos, and Tail of the Comet.
Scourge’s Forgeskill is Firewall, which allows you to deploy a stationary wall that deals Incendiary damage to anyone close to it and also increases damage and projectile speed for your whole party when they shoot through the shield, making it, once again, a great choice if you’re playing with a squad. Any damage absorbed will also be converted to Vengeance if you have your action skill active, allowing you to use your flail for cryo damage even more frequently.
Crucible - Cybernetics Skill TreeIf you like the Forgeknight’s overall vibe but aren’t really about diving headfirst into the fray or tanking tons of damage, you might want to look at investing in the Cybernetics skill tree with the Crucible action skill. When activated, you spawn two forge axes with two different elemental affinities attached to them.
To start, you’ve got fire on the left axe and frost on the right, but later augments allow you to specialize in Frost and Shock, or Fire and Shock, or you can stick with fire and frost and just make the fire axes pass through enemies and the frost axes freeze enemies in place. Hitting an enemy with an axe also primes them for an explosion if you follow up with your Forgeskill, which throws out a double-sided axe that does both fire and frost damage.
You have to play a little bit more conservatively if you go down this road as a Forgeknight, as you have fewer skills to choose from that focus on survivability, but on the flip side, you’ll be able to put out massive damage by speccing into critical damage, critical chance, and can dump your points into a Forgedrone that will attack enemies autonomously whenever you activate the skill.
Rafa - The Exo-Soldier OverviewRafa is for the players who miss Axton, Zero, and a little bit of Salvador from Borderlands 2. While you aren’t going to be able to merge the three into one play style, Rafa is the character to choose if you want that soldier class with a focus on explosive turrets that operate independently from the character, or that blade-wielding ninja zipping between enemies in a frenzy of fast-paced melee action.
Rafa's main trait is Overdrive, a major boost to movement speed and gun damage that is intrinsic during any action skill duration, and can be scaled to remain active long after his action skill has ended. Here’s everything you need to know about Rafa’s different skill trees:
Apophis Lance - People Person Skill TreeWith the action skill Apophis Lance, you sacrifice some gun accuracy and lose the ability to ADS with your main weapon, but the upside is you get to dual-wield with a cannon in your other hand that deals shock damage to anything hit by its projectiles. If you aren’t a fan of just a shock projectile, you can scale the cannon to turn it into an incendiary laser that melts enemies, or a corrosive bomb that poisons everything in the splash zone.
Peacebreaker Cannons - Remote Agent Skill TreeDo you like guns with your guns? Well then, the Peacebreaker Cannons are what you’re looking for. The cannons are mounted on Rafa’s back and shoot enemies as you move throughout the playing field.
They’ll mostly target enemies within your line of sight, but can and will target enemies that you may be shooting at with your standard guns in hand.
These turrets can be augmented to shoot countless bullets, send out copies of your grenade, dish out rockets at nearby enemies, ricochet from a distance, and even detach to fire at enemies from their set location. Rest in Peace, Roland.
Arc-Knives - This Year’s Gimmick Skill TreeSick of using your guns and just want to face tank everything? Arc-Knives it is! This action skill puts your weapons away and shifts Rafa into third person, wielding a set of large knives on either arm. Zip and dodge from enemy to enemy, dealing massive shock melee damage. These knives can be scaled to include other status effects like corrosion to keep the fights interesting against more shock-resistant enemies.
Fret not, however. You don’t have to go it alone with Arc-Knives. As you progress through the skill tree, damaging enemies with the blades will spawn drones that seek out other enemies and crash into them for added corrosive infliction. Alternatively, you can spin-to-win. Rafa can turn his blades into a singularity that draws enemies in as they spin.
Harlowe - The Gravitar OverviewIf you’re looking for a run-and-gun class with an elemental twist, Harlowe the Gravitar might be the perfect fit. While she doesn’t boast the heaviest raw firepower, she more than makes up for it with her mastery of deadly Cryo and Radiation damage.
Harlowe’s class trait, Entanglement, activates every time you use one of her action skills. Any damage dealt – whether from guns or skills – is shared across all entangled foes. The result? Harlowe can shred entire groups of enemies in record time. Speaking of action skills, here’s everything you need to know about her different skill trees:
CHROMA Accelerator – Creative Bursts Skill TreeCHROMA Accelerator is the most straightforward of Harlowe’s action skills, unleashing the full power of both Cryo and Radiation. When fired, Harlowe launches an energy pocket that leaves a freezing trail of Cryo damage, immobilizing enemies caught in its path. Press the action button again to detonate the pocket, triggering a massive blast of Radiation damage. Surviving enemies are blasted into the air while continuing to suffer lingering radiation burns. Best of all, the cooldown is only 38 seconds – so feel free to spam this devastating ability often.
To further enhance the CHROMA Accelerator, the Creative Bursts skill tree offers several early buffs worth considering. In addition to core improvements to Harlowe’s gunplay, like faster fire rate and quicker reloads, you’ll gain the option to augment the Accelerator in unique ways.
For example, the Voidstar augment boosts the Cryo phase’s damage output, not only stripping away more total health from enemies but also freezing them solid. On the other hand, the Neutron Capture augment reduces the immediate radiation damage when igniting the Accelerator’s energy pocket, but stores some of that power and channels it into Harlowe’s weapon. This temporarily infuses her bullets with bonus radiation damage.
We recommend using Neutron Capture for boss fights, while Voidstar excels at clearing out large enemy groups. If you’re looking for a big, explosive Action Skill that doesn’t require a ton of thought, then CHROMA Accelerator is the one for you!
Zero-Point - Seize the Day Skill TreeZero-Point is easily the most fun skill in Harlowe’s kit, and way more interactive than the rest. When you hit the Action Skill button, Harlowe fires up the HALO Accelerator and locks an enemy in Stasis for a short time. If the enemy can’t be frozen, they’ll just take damage instead.
Here’s where it gets really fun: press the Action Skill again, and you’ll slam that frozen enemy straight into the ground in front of Harlowe, triggering a small explosion for bonus damage. Just keep in mind you can’t spam it – there’s a cooldown before Stasis can be used again. Crashing enemies into each other is super satisfying, and the skill only gets better once you start investing in the Seize the Day tree.
You’ll find plenty of nodes that reduce Zero-Point’s cooldown and add some powerful augments to push it even further. Strange Attractor is great for quick crowd control. While an enemy is in Stasis, any bullets from Harlowe’s gun will ricochet off any enemy and hit the enemy that's currently suspended. Even better, critical hits will cause the enemy to become entangled – meaning all entangled targets share incoming gun damage. Before long, you’ll have entire groups melting under the crossfire.
Then there’s Peer Review, which gives Zero-Point a valuable support twist. Whenever an enemy enters Stasis, it spawns a homing Rejuvenating Projectile that seeks out Harlowe or one of her allies after the enemy is slammed, killed, or once Stasis ends. This projectile grants a buff that shortens Action Skill duration rate while boosting cooldown rate, letting you cycle skills more efficiently. And if it hits someone who’s in Fight for Your Life, they’ll instantly get a Second Wind – like they’d just scored a kill themselves.
Flux Generator - Cosmic Brilliance Skill TreeIf you’re looking for more control over Harlowe’s Action Skill, the Flux Generator might be the perfect fit. When activated, Harlowe drops the generator onto the field, creating a dome that deals continuous Cryo damage to enemies inside. At the same time, Harlowe and her allies gain an Overshield while standing within the dome.
One of the best things about Flux Generator is its uptime. It remains active on the battlefield for a full 22 seconds, and once you’ve cleared out enemies in its radius, you can press the action button to redeploy it somewhere else – as long as those 22 seconds haven’t run out. The tradeoff is its hefty 55-second cooldown. Still, with such a long duration on the field, it’s more than capable of saving you in a tough fight or helping burn down a large target.
Flux Generator pairs with the Cosmic Brilliance skill tree, which unlocks two strong early augments to enhance its power. Coronal Mass Ejection strips enemies inside the dome of all elemental resistances, while also boosting Status Effect chance for Harlowe and her allies – making status-based weapons far more effective.
On the other hand, Blue Giant adds powerful mobility. Each time you retrieve the generator, it leaves behind a Cryo Hazard that freezes enemies in place, and when you redeploy it, a Radiation Hazard erupts at the new location.
For general play, I recommend using Blue Giant during big crowd-control moments where you need to lock down waves of enemies. Switch to Coronal Mass Ejection against tougher, resistance-heavy foes to shred their defenses and maximize your team’s status damage.
That’s Harlowe in all her chaotic, cryo-radiated glory. So, whether you’re freezing mobs, slamming bosses, or saving your squad with some slick support skills, the Gravitar always finds a way to steal the spotlight.
