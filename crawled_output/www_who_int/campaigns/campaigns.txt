Global health days and weeks
Mark these days and weeks for health in your calendarGlobal public health days and weeks offer great potential to raise awareness and understanding about health issues and mobilize support for action, from the local community to the international stage. There are many world days observed throughout the year related to specific health issues or conditions – from Alzheimer's to zoonoses.However, WHO focuses particular attention on the 11 days and 2 weeks that WHO Member States have mandated as "official" global public health days and weeks.
