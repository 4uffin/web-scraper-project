World Patient Safety Day 2025
World Patient Safety Day
17 September 2025
Every child has the right to safe, quality health care — from the very beginning. Yet, newborns and young children face higher risks due to their rapid development, evolving health needs and different disease patterns. They rely on adults to speak up and make decisions for them. Children may also face added challenges depending on their socio-economic circumstances, such as not being able to get the care they need. These factors make them more susceptible to harm if care isn’t specifically adapted to their age, size, health condition and context. A single safety incident can have lifelong consequences for a child’s health and development. That’s why World Patient Safety Day 2025 is dedicated to ensuring safe care for every newborn and child, with a special focus on those from birth to nine years old. This year’s slogan, “Patient safety from the start!”, emphasizes the urgent need to act early and consistently to prevent harm throughout childhood, and yield benefits across the life course. WHO calls on parents, caregivers, health practitioners, health care leaders, educators and communities, to unite in action to prevent avoidable harm in paediatric care and to build a safer, healthier future for every child, as part of the global effort to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3.Campaign materials can be found on the campaign essentials page.

Campaign key messages
Children aren’t small adults. They require individualized safe care.
Children need care that fits them—their age, weight, developmental stage, medical needs, ability to communicate and specific context.
Safety first, always and in every health care setting.
Children are most at risk in intensive care and during complex treatments. Protecting them from unsafe care must come first.
The most common causes of harm are known.
These include errors with medications and diagnosis, infections caught during care, problems with medical equipment, such as tubes or monitors, and missed warning signs when a child’s condition starts getting worse.
Safer care depends on safe systems and teamwork.
Well-designed systems, supported staff and engaged caregivers keep children safe. Every voice counts.

From hospitals to homes, every child deserves a safe start in life. Let’s illuminate buildings, landmarks, and monuments as beacons of our shared commitment to protecting the youngest and most vulnerable among us. This year, WHO will light up the iconic Jet d’Eau in Geneva, symbolizing our global dedication to patient safety from the very beginning.Join the worldwide wave—light up the night in orange and stand for safer care for every child!
