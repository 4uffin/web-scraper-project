The Integrity hotline provides a safe and independent mechanism to report allegations of wrongdoing involving WHO
The hotline is managed by a professional company selected competitively by WHO, which is contractually bound not to share an individual’s personal details with WHO without permission from that individual. Reports made to the Integrity hotline are accessible only by WHO’s Office of Internal Oversight Services (IOS). This Office will assess allegations and may decide to initiate investigations, in accordance with its mandate. Reports can be made confidentially and anonymously.

Ethical principles
As a specialized agency of the UN system, WHO is firmly committed to the following ethical principles:Integrity: To behave in accordance with ethical principles, and act in good faith, with honesty and fairness.Accountability: To take responsibility for one’s actions, decisions, and their consequences.Independence and impartiality: To conduct oneself with the interests of WHO only in view and under the sole authority of the Director-General, and to ensure that personal views and convictions do not compromise ethical principles, official duties, or the interests of WHO.Respect: To respect the dignity, worth, equality, diversity, and privacy of all persons.Professional commitment: To demonstrate a high level of professionalism and loyalty to the Organization, its mandate, and objectives.We encourage everyone to report concerns of unethical behaviour by individuals working for WHO should they experience this themselves or be a witness to such behaviour.WHO is committed to addressing and responding to allegations of wrongdoing.
Integrity Hotline
Reports can be made confidentially or anonymouslyConfidentiality will only be waived with the express consent of the person making the report. We encourage anyone making an allegation to provide as much information and evidence as possible. This is particularly important in the case of anonymous reports, to enable the Organization to independently assess and corroborate the information reported.Not providing a means for investigators to contact you and ask for specific information will make the investigation more complex and less likely to succeed. If you wish to remain anonymous, consider including a valid email address in the Anonymous Email Address field. This address will not be shared with WHO; it will be used only to send you notifications when IOS posts a new message to you on the hotline. Please provide the following informationWhat alleged wrongdoing are you reporting?Describe in detail what happened.Who committed the alleged wrongdoing? Was anyone else involved? Provide full names and titles if possible.When and where did it happen? Indicate location, dates and times, if possible.How did the individual commit the alleged wrongdoing?Why do you believe the activity was improper?
