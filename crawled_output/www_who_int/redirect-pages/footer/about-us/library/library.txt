The WHO Library is the world’s leading library on public health. It provides access to knowledge from WHO as well as to other sources of scientific literature produced around the world. WHO Library resources and expertise also provide scientific
evidence and knowledge to low- and middle- income countries through a set of low-cost/high-use initiatives.
Networks and partnerships are an essential component in ensuring that our global initiatives reach a world-wide audience. Using a suite of collaborative tools, librarians and information specialists have a close understanding of country realities and
needs. This helps keep focus on adequate and cost-effective information and knowledge sharing solutions.The WHO Library holds and stores all the published information produced by WHO, including proceedings of the World Health Assembly and Executive Board, monographs, periodicals, unpublished technical documents, press releases, fact sheets and administrative
documents of the governing bodies.
Practical informationWHO Library visits and reference services are limited as the organization’s main building, in which the WHO Library was located, is currently under renovation that will last until end of 2024. During this time, WHO Library print collections will remain inaccessible to users.
