Why invest in WHO?
Investing in the World Health Organization is an investment in the health of all people, at all ages, everywhere.Since 1948, WHO has played a pivotal role in advancing global health, ensuring equitable access to essential health services, responding to health emergencies, and setting standards for all areas of health. WHO has made some remarkable achievements including the eradication of smallpox, reductions in child mortality, and significant progress in combating diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. WHO offers unparalleled global reach, legitimacy and expertise. It translates science and evidence into proven, affordable and effective solutions and action for physical and mental health. With presence in more than 150 countries, across all regions of the world, it works hand-in-hand with its 194 Member States, partners, health workers and communities to build the systems and implement interventions needed to keep people healthy and achieve health for all. WHO supports countries to make healthy choices the easiest choices for their citizens, from promoting healthy diets and creating tobacco- and pollution-free environments, to scaling up access to safe life-saving tools like vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.  WHO coordinates humanitarian action in emergencies, scales up in-country action for people in need, and quickly mobilizes support through trusted and committed global networks.And WHO is the only global convening place where all countries and partners committed to health come and work together for the well-being of everyone, everywhere, no matter age, income levels, gender or birthplace.
For over 70 years, WHO has been the world’s health organization. Giving to WHO is a gift to the world.Donate nowHow your donation makes a difference:  your donations go to help keep the world safe from outbreaks and future pandemics, to deliver life-saving treatment to the most vulnerable people, to help people live healthier lives, and to ensure access to the latest technology.Read more about our work
WHO's Investment Round
The WHO Investment Round is a new approach to mobilizing resources for WHO’s core work for the next 4 years (2025–2028). WHO has made significant progress through this mechanism towards more flexible, predictable, and resilient funding.But in a challenging funding environment, much remains to be done. Learn more about the Investment Round
Investment case
There has never been a more critical moment to invest in WHO, and strengthen the unique role it plays in global health. The investment cases describe how a stronger, more efficient and results-oriented WHO can serve and guide governments and partners in their efforts to improve the health of their populations and to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.
All for Health, Health for All: investment case 2025–2028
All for Health, Health for All is WHO’s third investment case and has been produced alongside the Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14) to capture the impact of a fully funded WHO over the period 2025–2028.
