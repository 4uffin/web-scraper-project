The Programme budget is a critical tool for Member States to set and approve the priorities of the Organization, define the targets to be delivered, and to monitor their achievement. It sets out the resource levels required to deliver this work, and provides the tool for the Member States to control these, so as to balance the Organization’s work across the different areas for which it is accountable.The biennial Programme budgets themselves are derived from the General Programme of Work approved by the Member States, which sets out the strategic direction of WHO. At present, WHO is operating within the scope of the 13th General Programme of Work, which
started in 2019, and was extended by two years by the World Health Assembly, to cover through to 2025.
The Programme Budget digital platform provides key information on the draft Proposed programme budget 2024-2025, including the governing bodies document, outputs narrative, digital dashboards and more.Programme budget digital platform 2024-25Programme budget digital platform 2026-27
