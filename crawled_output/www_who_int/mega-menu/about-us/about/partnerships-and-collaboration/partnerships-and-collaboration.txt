How we collaborate
WHO / M. Sethi
Monitoring diseases and identifying health trends - Data provided by countries allows WHO to obtain a clearer picture of who is falling sick, from which disease, when and where, so that efforts can be targeted where they are needed most.

Working together for the good of all people, everywhereCollaboration is at the heart of all we do. Every day we connect nations, partners and experts so that we can go further, together. Our partners help support WHO’s scientific work and field programmes, contribute funding and resources, engage in
our campaigns and programmes and join us in advocacy to bring policy and behaviour change for better health. Partnerships help us to deliver life-saving vaccines and supplies, raise funds for the Triple Billion Targets, establish consensus among leading
scientists and much more. From world leaders to international organizations, civil society, foundations, researchers and health workers, we mobilize every part of society to achieve health and safety for all.
Why we collaborateOur health goals require strong support from experts around the world. WHO currently works with 5 hosted partnerships, more than 100 collaborative arrangements and over 800 collaborating centres. These collaborations are the best way to extend
the reach of our programmes, learn from the knowledge and expertise of those in the field and support the objectives of national health systems. We believe improving health care is a global effort, and we are proud to work with a network of collaborators in over 80 countries. Together, we can improve the health and well-being of everyone.
