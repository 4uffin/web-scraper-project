More about Weekly bulletin →
The Weekly Bulletin focuses on public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. Each week, a brief description, followed by public health measures implemented and an interpretation of the situation is provided for a few selected events.
A table is provided at the end of the bulletin with information on all new and ongoing public health events currently being monitored in the region, as well as recent events that have largely been controlled and thus closed.
