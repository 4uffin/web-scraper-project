Advancing national and global health goalsSince WHO was founded in 1948, its presence in countries, territories and areas has been its primary mode of delivering technical cooperation to Member States. Today, WHO has dedicated staff working in 152 WHO country offices, some of which support more than one Member State.

WHO country teams play a crucial and catalytic role in providing leadership in the health sector and advancing national and global health goals. They provide technical assistance to governments, help plan and implement health programmes, and support advocacy and resource mobilization. In addition, WHO country teams also lead and convene joint action among health partners, working closely with other United Nations agencies, nongovernmental organizations, foundations, the private sector and communities. WHO also facilitates exchanges between countries, to promote cooperation and sharing of solutions to common challenges.WHO delivers its technical cooperation based on its country cooperation strategies. To oversee and strengthen WHO’s work in countries, the Department of Country Strategy and Support, based within the Office of the Director-General at WHO’s headquarters, together with country support units in the regions, works closely with country offices and all other stakeholders. WHO has been working to accelerate the strengthening of its country offices through an initiative led by WHO representatives in countries: the Action for Results Group. An Action Plan proposed by the group in February 2023 has kickstarted work to ensure country offices are empowered, predictably and appropriately staffed and financed, and operate in streamlined ways, so WHO is able to deliver impact where it matters – at the country level.

They also highlight ongoing challenges and represent the experience of a diverse range of countries, each with different population health needs, health system development, and recourse levels.
