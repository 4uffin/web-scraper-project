WHO country offices
WHO maintains a vital global presence through a network of 153 country offices. They support Member States in achieving their health priorities by providing tailored support to meet local needs, ranging from policy support to field operations. The term “WHO country office” refers to WHO offices in countries, territories and areas where WHO has a physical presence and where offices were operational in 2024. However, WHO has a physical presence in 166 of the 194 Member States. This total includes: 146 Member States served by a dedicated single country office (including four offices that also serve more than one territory or area); 19 Member States served by five multi-country offices; and one Member State (Israel) where WHO is represented by a Special Representative.
