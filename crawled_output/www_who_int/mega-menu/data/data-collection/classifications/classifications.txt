Benefits of WHO-FICICD-11, ICF and ICHI are key for effective knowledge representation and interoperability.WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) allows all healthcare workers (and patients) to communicate using one (technical) language.In a hyper-connected world, WHO-FIC with their shared terminology are key for supporting natural language processing (NLP).WHO-FIC with their shared terminology are key for effective text mining or text analytics (the process of deriving high-quality information from plain and unstructured text).ICD-11, ICF, and ICHI: empowering better health with smarter use of resources.

Common Foundation - Terminology components
The Foundation Component represents the entire WHO-FIC universe. It is a multidimensional collection of interconnected entities and synonyms. These entities consist of diseases, disorders, injuries, external causes, signs and symptoms, functional descriptions,
interventions, and extension codes.
ICD-11 statistical core (MMS) is derived from this foundation, ICF and ICHI will follow. Currently, with over hundred thousand entities and the ontological design of the foundation component, more than one million terms can be captured. The Foundation Component also includes WHO terminologies such as: WHO INN (non proprietary names - medicaments)/ATCWHO DevicesHistopathology (tumours)AnatomyDetails of external causesSeverityInfectious agentsSites and activities Rare diseases
Derived classificationsDerived classifications are extensions of reference classifications, and are created for use within a specialty setting and are derived from the common foundation.See all derived classifications  Related classificationsRelated classifications are complementary to reference and derived classifications, and cover specialty areas not otherwise described in the Family of International Classifications (FIC). See all related classifications
