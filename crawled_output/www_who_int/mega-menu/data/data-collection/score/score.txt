The SCORE for Health Data Technical Package was developed by WHO and partners to assist Member States in strengthening country data systems and capacity to monitor progress towards the health-related SDGs, Triple Billion targets, and other national and
subnational health priorities.
It provides a comprehensive framework which enables national policymakers and planners to:
Focus investments on priority interventions (“best buys”) – proven to be effective, feasible, affordable, scalable, and sustainable;
Access recommended actions, good practices, tools and standards;
Identify critical gaps and needs and allow for continuous monitoring, based on a set of simple, standardized, verifiable core indicators.
