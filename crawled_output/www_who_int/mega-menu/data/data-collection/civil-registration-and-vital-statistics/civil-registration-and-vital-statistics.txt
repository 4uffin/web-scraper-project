Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)
Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS)A well-functioning civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system registers all births and deaths, issues birth and death certificates, and compiles and disseminates vital statistics, including cause of death information. It may also record marriages and divorces.

Background to CRVS
Despite the well-documented benefits of CRVS, many countries do not have adequate systems in place. The births of tens of millions of children are known to be unregistered every year, and it is estimated that two-thirds of deaths are never registered and are thus not counted in the vital statistics system.Why counting births and deaths is important
Critical gaps remain in birth, death & cause of death data. WHO’s civil registration plan can help
Health sector and civil registration: Role of the health sector in CRVS strengthening
A well-functioning Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System, better known as CRVS, uses inputs into and exits from a population register to provide governments with critical information on their population by age, sex and location, on which to develop policies and plan services. Good public health decision-making requires timely, reliable and actionable data on births and deaths, including cause of death, collected through these systems. CRVS partners are encouraged to join forces towards the implementation of the WHO CRVS strategic plan, so that together everyone is counted because everyone counts.
This video by the World Health Organization describes how linking the health sector to the civil registration authority can lead to Universal Civil Registration for Universal Health Coverage.

OverviewThis guidance aims to support health-related programme managers and civil registrars as they define strategies to strengthen CRVS systems and leverage global and regional initiatives aiming to achieve universal registration of births, deaths and stillbirths. The guidance is based on the premise that the health sector can play a proactive role in ensuring that births and deaths are officially registered by national civil registration systems. This follows because vital events such as births and deaths often take place within a health institution; health workers are in contact with people at key moments in the life course – at the time of birth and at the moment of death.The guidance describes the mutual benefits that would accrue to individuals and societies from enhanced collaboration between civil registrars, health entities and other stakeholders with a role in vital statistics. It describes some common scenarios in which births and deaths occur and outlines key steps that health workers can take to enable them to be registered.
