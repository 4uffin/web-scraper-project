Introduction
Toolkit for Routine Health Information Systems data
Health facilities submit regular (e.g. monthly) reports on health service activities and the conditions for which people seek care through the RHIS. The RHIS provides frequent, up-to-date information on service performance at all levels of the health system, enabling regular analysis of progress and timely identification of problems.The Toolkit for analysis and use of routine health facility data provides standards and guidance for analysis of RHIS data for individual health programmes as well as integrated analysis for general health service management.
Introduction
Health service data are essential for patient management, facility management, disease surveillance and monitoring of service provision and resource use. Countries also need reliable facility data to assess the performance of their health services as
they work towards the UHC targets and the SDGs. Health facilities continuously generate data as part of their service delivery activities. Routine health facility data are collected and reported on a regular basis through Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS). These data are analysed and used at
all levels of the health system to improve access and quality of care.This toolkit is a set of capacity-building resources to optimize analysis and use of routine facility data and represents a collaborative effort among multiple WHO programmes and partners. It promotes an integrated, standards-based approach using a limited
set of standardized core indicators with recommended analyses, visualizations and dashboards. The RHIS toolkit consists of a series of integrated general and programme-specific modules which contain guidance documents, electronic configuration packages and training materials. These modules are designed to be software agnostic. However, with the
collaboration of the University of Oslo, the modules have been digitalized into DHIS2 configuration packages.This toolkit will be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure  alignment with the most recent guidelines and evidence and its evolution and improvement over time.SCOREThe triple billion targets: A visual summary of methods to deliver impactDHIS2 Explore available modules
This effort is led by WHO and its Collaborating Centre on Innovation and Implementation Research for Health Information System Strengthening at the University of Oslo, with support from Health Data Collaborative partners, including UNICEF,
Global Fund, GAVI and PEPFAR.For questions or comments, please contacthealthinfo@who.int
