Health Inequality Monitor
Health equity is the absence of unfair, avoidable or remediable differences in health among population groups, defined by social, economic, demographic or geographic characteristics. Health inequalities are measurable differences in health across population subgroups. Monitoring health inequalities provides evidence on who is being left behind and informs health policies, programmes and practices that aim to close existing gaps and achieve health equity.Contact: inequality_monitoring@who.int
