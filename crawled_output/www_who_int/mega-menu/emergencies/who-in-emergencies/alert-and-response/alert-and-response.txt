Alert and Response
Alert and response
Early detection and rapid response to signals of potential public health events can prevent local events from becoming global emergencies.  WHO works to quickly detect health threats, assess their risks, and send timely alerts. Under the International Health Regulations, WHO is mandated to detect and assess public health risks and events, help countries respond to them, and share critical information with other countries.
Framework of public health intelligence activities
WHO then conducts initial risk assessments for all verified public health events.In 2016 WHO formalized the methodological approach for more in-depth rapid risk assessments for events that may require additional operational support from WHO. This process supports efforts to control and mitigate the public health risk, prevent further spread, and reduce associated morbidity and mortality.The early warning function conducted by WHO, is implemented through the dissemination of information related to public health events and their associated risk, using a variety of channels reaching different audiences. Dissemination channels include posting on the secure Event Information Site, accessible to States Parties to the IHR; reports on the WHO website (Disease Outbreak News, Situation reports, Weekly epidemiological record, Dashboards), and scientific publications.
