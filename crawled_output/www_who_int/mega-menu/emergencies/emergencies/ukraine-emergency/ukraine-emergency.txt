Ukraine emergency
WHO is working through our offices in Ukraine and neighboring countries, and with partners, to respond to the health emergency triggered by the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. We are delivering specialized medical supplies, coordinating the deployment of medical teams, and working with health authorities to minimize disruptions to the delivery of critical healthcare services within Ukraine and in countries hosting refugees.WHO continues to deliver much-needed support on urgent health needs, with urgent priorities being mental health, rehabilitation – of the health systems and the affected populations - and community access to health services.During the crisis, health must remain a priority pillar, with health workers being protected so they can continue to save lives and with health systems and facilities being protected so that they remain functional, safe and accessible to all who need essential medical services. It is imperative to ensure that life-saving medical supplies – including oxygen – reach those who need them. WHO is coordinating nearly 200 health partners to deliver various health services across the country, reaching 8.5 million people in 2022.
