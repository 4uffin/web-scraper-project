Mpox outbreak
An upsurge of mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its spread to neighbouring countries was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 14 August 2024.Mpox is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus. It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever.  It can make people very sick and leave scars. A global outbreak of mpox began in May 2022 and continues to this day. In recent months, cases have been increasing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A new strain of the virus, called Clade Ib, is causing outbreaks in previously unaffected areas of the country and has spread to countries that had not previously reported mpox. WHO is working with affected countries and partners to contain these outbreaks.
