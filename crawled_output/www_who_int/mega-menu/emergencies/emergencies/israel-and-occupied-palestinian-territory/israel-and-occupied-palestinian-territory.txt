Conflict in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory
Since 7 October 2023, the escalating crisis in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory has caused large numbers of civilian deaths and injuries. In the Gaza Strip, airstrikes and a lack of medical supplies, food, water and fuel have virtually depleted an already under-resourced health system. Hospitals have been operating far beyond capacity due to rising numbers of patients as well as displaced civilians seeking shelter. The provision of essential health services – from maternal and newborn care to treatment for chronic conditions – has been severely compromised, due to the lack of access and hostilities near hospitals. In Gaza, about fifty people are still being held hostage.Attacks on health have been reported in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, killing and injuring health workers and patients, and damaging health facilities and ambulances. WHO is working with partners to address the most urgent health needs, supporting the health systems to continue functioning. We deliver life-saving supplies, organize external medical help, and monitor and respond to disease outbreaks. WHO urges all parties to protect health and ensure safe access to healthcare for their populations. Ultimately, WHO calls for peace.
