The Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) was first issued in 1926 by the Health Office of the League of Nations. It was entrusted to the World Health Organization (WHO) when it was created in 1948 and has appeared every week since then.  The WER is the official, legally recognized organ of communication between WHO and its Member States for all matters pertaining to the revised International Health Regulations (IHR).It serves as an essential instrument for the rapid and accurate dissemination of epidemiological information on cases and outbreaks of diseases under the IHR and on other communicable diseases of public health importance, including emerging or re-emerging infections.An electronic bilingual English/French version of the WER is accessible every Friday and can be downloaded free of charge.
