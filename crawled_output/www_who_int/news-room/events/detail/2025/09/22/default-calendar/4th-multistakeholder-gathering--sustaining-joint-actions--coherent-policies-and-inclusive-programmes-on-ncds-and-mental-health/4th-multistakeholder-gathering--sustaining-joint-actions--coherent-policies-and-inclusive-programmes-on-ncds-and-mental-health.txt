4th Multistakeholder Gathering: Sustaining joint actions, coherent policies and inclusive programmes on NCDs and mental health
4th Multistakeholder Gathering: Sustaining joint actions, coherent policies and inclusive programmes on NCDs and mental health
22 September 2025 18:00 – 20:00 ET
58 Park Ave, New York, United States of America
4th Multistakeholder Gathering, co-sponsored by the WHO Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs (GCM/NCD), NCD Alliance and World
Diabetes Foundation.Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health conditions
continue to pose one of today’s most pressing global health and equity
challenges. Effective NCD prevention and control require coordinated
action across sectors, as many root causes and consequences lie beyond
health.Governance and public policies must be coordinated and coherent
across finance, trade, social affairs, economic development, treasury,
technology and education sectors, among others. Multistakeholder action,
including whole-of-government & whole-of-society approaches, is
widely recognised as a successful factor for effective NCD prevention
and control.Supporting multistakeholder engagement in the global NCD response, the WHO Global Coordination Mechanism on NCDs, and the NCD Alliance, in collaboration with World Diabetes
Foundation (WDF) and other partners, have since 2022 co-sponsored a
yearly Multistakeholder Gathering on NCDs alongside the UN General
Assembly (UNGA). This fourth Multistakeholder Gathering, held on the margins of the UN
High-Level Meeting on NCDs and Mental Health, will provide high-level
political leaders, technical government staff and leading civil society
actors with practical insights on how countries can advocate for,
implement and sustain multisectoral governance and multistakeholder
engagement for NCD and mental health response. The event will spotlight country experiences, highlight data-driven
and evidence-informed approaches, introduce powerful narratives to
mobilise action. At the event, we will also launch three new thematic
issue briefs on governance, data sharing, and narrative-building to
drive multisectoral action in the NCD and mental health response.Registration
