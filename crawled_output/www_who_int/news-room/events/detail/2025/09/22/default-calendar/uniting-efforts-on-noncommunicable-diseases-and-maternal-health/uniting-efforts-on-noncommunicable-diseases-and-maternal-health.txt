Uniting efforts on noncommunicable diseases and maternal health
Uniting efforts on noncommunicable diseases and maternal health
22 September 2025 16:00 – 18:00 ET
Virtual or UNFPA Headquarters, 605 Third Ave. New York, Orange Café, New York, USA
From integration to impactOn the sidelines of the 4th United Nations High-Level Meeting (HLM) on the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases, there will be an event to spotlight the growing issue of maternal health and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).  “Uniting Efforts on Noncommunicable Diseases and Maternal Health: From Integration to Impact”, co-hosted by UNFPA, World Diabetes Foundation, Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (PMNCH), Jhpiego, Maternity Foundation and HRP, the United Nations Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction, will take place on 22 September 2025, at UNFPA Headquarters, 605 Third Ave. New York, Orange Café from 4-6 pm EST.  Since the 3rd UN HLM on NCDs in 2018, the global health community has endorsed the promotion of integrated primary health care and community health as prerequisite for an effective NCD response and for the attainment of universal health coverage (UHC). The Political declaration of the 4th HLM on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and well-being is calling explicitly for integrating prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and long-term care into existing programmes for communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and sexual and reproductive health programmes. This event will assess the progress made in integrating maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) care and health promotion with strategies addressing NCDs. It will focus on specific, high-burden examples and include case presentations from low- and middle-income countries.
