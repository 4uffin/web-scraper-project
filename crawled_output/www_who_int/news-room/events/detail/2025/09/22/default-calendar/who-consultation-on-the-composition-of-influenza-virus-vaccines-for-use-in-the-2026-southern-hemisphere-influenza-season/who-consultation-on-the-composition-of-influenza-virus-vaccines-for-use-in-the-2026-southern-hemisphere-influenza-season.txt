WHO Consultation on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2026 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season
22 – 25 September 2025
Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan
WHO ConsultationBackgroundThe periodic replacement of viruses contained in influenza vaccines is necessary for the vaccines to be effective due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, including those circulating and infecting humans.Twice annually, WHO organizes consultations with an advisory group of experts to analyze influenza virus surveillance data generated by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and issues recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccines for the following influenza season. These recommendations are used by the national vaccine regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to develop, produce and license influenza vaccines.ObjectivesAnalyze the antigenic and genetic characteristics of seasonal influenza viruses circulating and infecting humans, taking into consideration the available epidemiological and clinical information from individual countries and regions;Make recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2026 Southern Hemisphere influenza season; andReview the antigenic and genetic characteristics of recent A(H5) and other subtypes or variant zoonotic influenza viruses, that the WHO Collaborating Centres of GISRS received and assess the need to develop new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes.Participants (by invitation)Representatives from WHO Collaborating Centres for influenza (CCs) of GISRS;Representatives from WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) of GISRS;Representatives from National Influenza Centres and WHO H5 Reference Laboratories of GISRS;Representatives from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Modelling, Evolution, and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases; Representatives from the FAO/WOAH Network of Expertise on Animal Influenza (OFFLU); andOther subject matter experts.Provisional main agenda itemsReview of antigenic and genetic characterization data of seasonal, A(H5) and other subtypes or variant influenza viruses analysed by the WHO Collaborating Centres and other reference laboratories;Review of the global influenza activity;Analysis of results from vaccine serological studies;Recommendations for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the 2026 Southern Hemisphere influenza season; andReview of the need and subsequent selection of new A(H5) and other subtypes or variant viruses for the development of new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes.
