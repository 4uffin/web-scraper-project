New language editions of the Clinical practice handbook for quality abortion care
New language editions of the Clinical practice handbook for quality abortion care
23 September 2025 14:00 – 15:30 CET
French, Portuguese, Spanish The webinar will mark the launch of the French, Portuguese, and Spanish editions of the Clinical practice handbook for quality abortion care. This handbook complements the WHO Abortion care guideline by translating its clinical recommendations into practical guidance for health workers. Designed for a broad range of providers – including nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and clinicians – it reflects the latest recommendations in abortion care included in the Abortion care guideline, supports health workers in applying their existing competencies, and promotes safe self-management of abortion. Additionally, it offers examples of how health care providers can apply human rights principles while they provide comprehensive abortion care.
