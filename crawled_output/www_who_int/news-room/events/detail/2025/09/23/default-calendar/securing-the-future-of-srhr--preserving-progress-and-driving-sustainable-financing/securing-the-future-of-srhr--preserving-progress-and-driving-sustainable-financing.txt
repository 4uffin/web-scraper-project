Securing the future of SRHR: preserving progress and driving sustainable financing
Securing the future of SRHR: preserving progress and driving sustainable financing
23 September 2025 14:00 – 15:30 CET
On the virtual sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly discussions on multilateralism, peace, and development, the WHO-UNFPA Learning by Sharing Portal (LSP) and Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevölkerung (DSW) invite you to engage in a discussion with representatives from government, civil society, and donors on sustainable financing for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). With evidence from DSW’s 2025 Donors Delivering for SRHR report, panelists will assess the impact of declining global SRHR funding on access to essential reproductive health services and discuss strategies for strengthening sustainable funding. The reductions in foreign aid threaten to reverse decades of progress in access to essential services, exacerbate inequalities, with devastating impacts, particularly on women and girls around the world. Low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) reliant on donor funding are already reporting shortages or stockouts of contraceptives, antiretrovirals, STI prevention and treatment as well as for and closures of health facilities. These disruptions are expected to lead to increases in unintended pregnancies, unsafe deliveries and abortions, HIV transmission, and AIDS-related illness. At the same time, a growing global pushback against gender equality and women’s rights has resulted in increased restrictions on abortion, contraception, comprehensive sex education, and other reproductive health services.    The current moment presents an opportunity to reassess the global funding landscape and implement measures that protect hard-won progress, expand access, and promote sustainable financing.
