About the eventWHO is launching the 2025 edition of the Global Hypertension Report during the United Nations General Assembly. The event will bring together ministers and global health leaders to spotlight the urgent need for expanded and accelerated action to control hypertension worldwide.Why it mattersHypertension remains one of the world’s leading causes of death and disability, affecting 1.4 billion people globally. Yet, only 1 in 5 individuals with hypertension have it under control. Scaling up access to simple, affordable, and effective treatment for just 50% of affected individuals could prevent 76 million deaths by 2050 and save USD 100 billion annually in health care costs.This event coincides with the Fourth High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) and Mental Health, taking place on 25 September 2025. This meeting is a pivotal moment for global health, where world leaders will adopt a new Political Declaration to accelerate progress on NCD prevention and control. Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is central to this agenda. What the report coversThe new WHO Global Hypertension Report 2025 will:highlight the global burden of hypertension and the devastating health and economic consequences of inaction;present country-level data on hypertension prevalence and control;outline policy recommendations and evidence-based interventions; andshowcase progress and challenges in different regions and settings.SpeakersDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, WHODr Tom Frieden, President and CEO, Resolve to Save LivesDr Kelly Henning, Bloomberg PhilanthropiesDr Mekdes Daba, Minister of Health, Federal Republic of EthiopiaMrs. Murti Utami, Acting Director General for Disease Control, IndonesiaDr Víctor Atallah Lajam, Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance, Dominican RepublicDr Gloria Balboa, Assistant Secretary, Department of Health, PhilippineDr Jarbas Barbosa da Silva Jr, Director, Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization Ms Leanne Riley, Unit Head, Surveillance, monitoring and reporting, World Health OrganizationModerator: Ms Alice Park, Senior correspondent, TIMEWebcast
