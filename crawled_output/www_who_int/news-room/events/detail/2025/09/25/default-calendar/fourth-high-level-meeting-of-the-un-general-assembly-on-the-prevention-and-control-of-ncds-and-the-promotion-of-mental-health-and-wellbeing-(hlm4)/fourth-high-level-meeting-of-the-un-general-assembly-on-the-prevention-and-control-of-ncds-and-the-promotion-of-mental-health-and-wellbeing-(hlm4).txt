Fourth High-level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and wellbeing (HLM4)
Fourth High-level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on the prevention and control of NCDs and the promotion of mental health and wellbeing (HLM4)
25 September 2025
New York, United States of America
On 25 September 2025, Heads of States and Government will meet at the UN General Assembly to set a new vision for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and the promotion of mental health and wellbeing towards 2030 and beyond through a new, ambitious and achievable Political Declaration.
The Fourth UN High-level Meeting on NCDs marks a unique, decennial opportunity to adopt a new, ambitious and achievable political declaration on NCDs and mental health conditions towards 2030 and beyond. Building on evidence and grounded in human rights, the declaration will form the core framework to accelerate global NCD prevention and control from 2025. Halfway to 2030, progress towards achieving SDG target 3.4 and reducing premature mortality from NCDs by one third through prevention and treatment and the promotion of mental health and well-being are off track. Underinvestment in health services has created a significant equity gap in care and support for people affected by NCDs and mental health conditions. Unless urgent action is taken, the health of individuals, households and societies will be significantly affected in the long term.The global NCD burden and the urgency of promoting mental health and well-being are no longer just a health system problem. HLM4 calls upon Member States and global partners to renew and reinforce their committed to addressing NCDs and mental health challenges – through stronger whole-of-government and whole-of society collaboration, and by reshaping health systems, supporting sustainable financing mechanisms, and tackling the underlying social, economic, commercial and environmental drivers of risk and inequities.Ahead of HLM4, WHO urges countries, nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies, citizens and people living with a health condition to join forces, take action and support local and global efforts to accelerate an inclusive, equitable and quality NCD and mental health response.Read more
