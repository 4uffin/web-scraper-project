Webinar: global guidance on the prevention of re-establishment of malaria transmission
25 September 2025 08:30 – 10:00 CET
Virtual
WHO and the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN), hosted by the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance (APLMA), are convening a high-level webinar to introduce the new global guidance on the prevention of establishment of malaria transmission and share country experiences.Preventing the re-establishment of malaria is a core goal of the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2015. With progress towards elimination in many countries, the risk of imported cases leading to renewed transmission remains a major concern – particularly in the context of population movement, climate change, weakened surveillance, and health system challenges.The new WHO guidance provides technical direction for near- and post-elimination settings, as well as countries at high risk of re-establishment.SpeakersProfessor Emeritus Dr Kamini Mendis – moderatorDr Daniel Ngamije – introduction and high-level overview of the guidanceDr Li Xiao Hong – key components of the guidanceMs Maria de Fatima Mota – country perspectives and challengesTo register for the webinarClick here
