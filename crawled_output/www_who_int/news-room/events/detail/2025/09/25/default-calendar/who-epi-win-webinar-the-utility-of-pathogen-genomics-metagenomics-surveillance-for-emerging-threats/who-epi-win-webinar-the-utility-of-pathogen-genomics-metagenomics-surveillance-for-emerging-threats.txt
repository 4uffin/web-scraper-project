WHO EPI-WIN Webinar: the utility of pathogen genomics - metagenomics surveillance for emerging threats
25 September 2025 13:00 – 14:00 CET
Virtual meeting
The International Pathogen Surveillance Network (IPSN) is a global network of pathogen genomic actors, brought together by the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, to accelerate progress in pathogen genomics, and improve public health decision-making.  To inform country capacity building activities the webinar series aims to provide a forum for expert and evidence-based discussions on the role of genomics with a focus on providing high level context to countries and funders about its utility in various settings. This webinar series has been prepared in collaboration with colleagues at Taskforce for Global Health and Science for Africa Foundation. Increasing numbers of countries are considering the use of metagenomics, i.e. the direct sequencing of DNA/RNA from clinical samples, as a public health surveillance tool, with the promise of “unbiased” pathogen surveillance and a single methodological approach that does not require culture. This webinar will show it’s emerging use as applied in a variety of public health settings.Metagenomics has the potential to simplify and democratize the application of genomics for pathogen surveillance increasing the potential for equitable access to this technology.This webinar will spotlight the utility of metagenomics as a public health surveillance tool to support the detection and characterisation of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. Participants will have an expanded understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this methodology including on the evidence base guiding its use. Speakers will present current and future perspectives on the applicability of metagenomics to surveillance of respiratory pathogen; its use in characterising outbreaks of unknown origin and its applicability in detecting animal spill over events.Speakers
