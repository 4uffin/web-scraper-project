UNGA80 Side event: Advancing noncommunicable diseases and mental health equity for refugees and migrants
25 September 2025 08:00 – 09:30 ET
Global, Live-streamed from NYC, USA
Format: Hybrid event: Instituto Cervantes; Live-streamed globally from New York, USA. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 70% of global deaths and disproportionately affect refugees, migrants, and displaced populations. These groups often face barriers to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and continuity of care. These challenges are intensified by displacement, social and economic inequities, and climate-related risks. With over 1 billion people on the move today, ensuring their inclusion in the 2025 Political Declaration on NCDs and Mental Health is critical to advancing equity, Universal Health Coverage, and the Sustainable Development Goals. This high-level side event, held on the margins of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, will bring together representatives from Member States, UN agencies, and non-state actors to highlight evidence, share best practices, and strengthen collective support for inclusive, rights-based, and evidence-informed approaches to NCD and mental health care, while catalyzing political commitment to migrant- and refugee-inclusive strategies.The is event is co-hosted by Spain, Egypt, WHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, IOM, and IFRC.Agenda Moderat​ed by Dr Revati Phalkey.
