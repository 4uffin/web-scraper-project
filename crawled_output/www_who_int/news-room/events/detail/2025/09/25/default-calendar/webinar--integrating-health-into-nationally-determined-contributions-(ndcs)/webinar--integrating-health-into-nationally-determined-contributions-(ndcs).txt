Webinar: Integrating Health into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
Webinar: Integrating Health into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
25 September 2025
online
Climate change poses a serious and escalating threat to public health and healthcare systems. Yet, the health sector accounts for 4.6% of global emissions. By embedding health considerations within Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), we can both strengthen health sector mitigation and adaptation efforts and fully capture the health benefits of climate action across all sectors. A resilient health sector is critical for building adaptive capacity and responding to climate-related public health emergencies and extreme weather events. NDCs are central to the 2015 Paris Agreement, serving as a key climate action plan that 195 Parties (countries and territories) have agreed to create, enact and regularly update, as well as report progress to the UNFCCC. Updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are due to be submitted in 2025, providing a critical opportunity to strengthen the integration of health. This webinar is a focused training session designed to support meaningful integration of health into NDCs. Using the WHO guidance Quality criteria for integrating health into Nationally Determined Contributions (‎NDCs), the webinar will feature presentations from experts, real-world case studies from countries, and a Q&A session.  The webinar is available in two sessions to suit global timezones. Participants will only need to attend one session as the agenda will be the same in both sessions: September 25, 2025, 09:00 CET/Geneva time or 15:00 CET/Geneva time.Register for the AM session (09:00 CET) Register for the PM session (15:00 CET)
