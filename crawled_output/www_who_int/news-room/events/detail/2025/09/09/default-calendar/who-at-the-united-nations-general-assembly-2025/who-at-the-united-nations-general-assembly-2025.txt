WHO at the United Nations General Assembly 2025
9 – 28 September 2025
New York, USA
The World Health Organization and partners will raise global awareness during the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on progress in addressing a range of critical issues impacting people’s health worldwide, and urgent work that needs to be scaled up.These will include protecting people from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases; advocating for scale up of mental health services; addressing the common risks caused by tobacco, unhealthy diet, alcohol, physical inactivity and climate change; and finding solutions to raise resources to finance national health systems. Promoting peace as the best medicine to protect health and end conflicts in various parts of the world will also feature prominently during UNGA.On 25 September, the Fourth UNGA High-level Meeting on NCDs and mental health will be held, with the aim of setting a new vision to protect people from the world's leading killers. NCDs account for nearly 75% of all deaths globally, and over a billion people are living with mental health conditions. The WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is expected to address the opening of this event, joined by leadership of the United Nations, Member States and other key partners.In addition, strategic events held on 24 September, in collaboration with partners, including the
Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum, will focus on how pro-health taxes on harmful products such as tobacco can protect people’s health and raise needed resources for national health services. The challenge of the global obesity epidemic will also be a subject of major attention. In addition, WHO will release the Global Hypertension Report during the Assembly, warning that uncontrolled high blood pressure remains one of the world’s leading causes of premature death.This year’s General Assembly takes place at a critical time for the multilateral system as it adapts to a range of new realities. WHO has been working closely with fellow UN agencies, through the UN80 Initiative, to improve efficiencies in its operations while remaining committed to deliver on its mission of advancing health for all.WHO and partners will also be advocating for action to reduce the threats to health that people face worldwide from the impacts of conflicts, such as those in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, climate change and diseases such as polio. WHO events at UNGA 8021 September 15:00–17:15 | Safeguarding progress for adolescent girls in a shifting global landscapeSponsors: Partnership for Women’s Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (PMNCH), Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (WHO/HRP), International Association of Adolescent HealthLocation: Westin Grand CentralBy invitation only 22 September 07:30–08:45 | United to finish the job: high-level side event on polio eradicationSponsors: KSRelief, WHO, UNICEF, Polio Global Eradication Initiative (GPEI)Location: UNICEF HouseBy invitation only 22 September 08:00–10:00 | PMNCH annual accountability breakfastSponsors: PMNCH and Global Leaders Network (GLN).
