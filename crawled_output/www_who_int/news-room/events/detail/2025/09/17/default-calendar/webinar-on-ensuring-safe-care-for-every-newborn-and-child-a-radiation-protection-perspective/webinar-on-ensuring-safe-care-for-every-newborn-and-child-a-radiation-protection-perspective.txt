Webinar on Ensuring safe care for every newborn and child:
A radiation protection perspective
17 September 2025 12:30 – 14:00 CET
Online
World Patient Safety Day 2025BackgroundEnsuring safe care for patients is a fundamental priority, yet newborns and children remain especially vulnerable to patient safety risks. To bring attention to this critical issue, “Safe care for every newborn and every child” has been selected as the theme for World Patient Safety Day 2025. This is especially relevant when it comes to medical imaging and radiation safety where an understanding of benefits and risks is important. Through the slogan “Patient safety from the start!”, WHO calls for concerted efforts for stronger measures to protect children from preventable harm in health care. Addressing this challenge requires comprehensive efforts across key patient safety areas, such as safe childbirth and postnatal care, medication safety, diagnostic safety, infection prevention and early recognition of clinical deterioration. The World Patient Safety Day 2025 aims to drive meaningful improvements and reaffirm every child's right to safe and quality care. The Webinar aims to raise global awareness of safety risks in paediatric and newborn care in all health care settings, emphasizing the specific needs of children, families and caregivers when using radiation for diagnosis and treatment. It will bring together a number of Non-State Actors in official relations with WHO involved in radiation safety and medical imaging to discuss strategies for improving patient safety and radiation protection in paediatric and newborn care. A panel will discuss possible collaboration to strengthen radiation protection for paediatric and newborn care across different regions. This Webinar is organized by WHO, kindly hosted by ISR with contributions from WFPI and the following NSAs in official relations with WHO: ICNIRP, ICRP, IOMP, ISR, ISRRT, WFNMB and WFUMB.AgendaWelcoming remarks – Dr Rüdiger Krech, Director a.i., Environment, Climate Change One Health and Migration (WHO)  World Patient Safety Day 2025 – Dr Ayda Taha, Technical Officer (WHO) DG recorded message WHO activities on radiation protection of children and newborns – Dr Ferid Shannoun, Scientist (WHO)Paediatric Imaging in newborns and children - why radiation protection matters from day one – Dr Elaine Kan, Radiologist and Dr Kevin Fung, Radiologist (WFPI) Panel discussion with Non-State Actors in official relations with WHO on:Their role in enhancing radiation protection for newborns and children; and Their collaboration through a multidisciplinary approach to strengthen radiation protection for paediatric and newborn care across different regions.
