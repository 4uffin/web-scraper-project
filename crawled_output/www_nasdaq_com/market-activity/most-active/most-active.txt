About Most Active
How does Nasdaq define the "Ten Most Advanced" and "Ten Most Declined" on the "Most Active" page? The Advanced/Declined information is based on the percentage increase/decrease in stock price of Nasdaq Global and Global Select Market securities (does not include warrants and units). The tables contain only securities whose last sale price is greater than $2 and whose daily volume is greater than 3000 shares. The information is updated every minute. Most Active is available for:
