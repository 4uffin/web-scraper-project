Where this Privacy Policy states that a provision applies “to the extent required by applicable law,” such provision will be applicable only to the extent that Nasdaq is subject to legal requirements imposing it.For purposes of data protection laws, except where this Privacy Policy does not apply, as described below, the Nasdaq entity that will be the “controller” of your Personal Data will be the entity that is contracted to deliver the products or services you (or the company for whom you are working or have a business relationship) are receiving or maintains the Site that you are using.
