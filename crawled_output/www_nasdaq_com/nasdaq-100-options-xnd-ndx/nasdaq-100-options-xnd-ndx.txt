The Nasdaq-100 Index® (NDX®)
Capitalize on the performance of the world’s most innovative companies
Home to some of the most innovative companies in the world, the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) features modern-day industrials. It is made up of 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization.Investing in the NDX® allows investors to gain exposure to leading businesses that drive the economy across a broad swath of industries including technology, health care, and consumer staples. Diversity is critical to the index’s outstanding success over the past two decades, with a total return of nearly 985% from 2007 to 2024—over 3.5 times that of the S&P 500.
Why Trade Options?
Tracking the NDX through NDX® index options offers investors the opportunity to capitalize on the performance of these innovative companies. Whether to protect a portfolio against a market correction, hedge risks, or generate yield enhancement, NDX index options give both retail and institutional investors the ability to stay invested in equities, while reducing downside risk. Think of options as buying an insurance policy with a one-time premium payment.

Benefits of Nasdaq-100 Index Options
#1
Cash Settled
With an NDX option contract, cash is delivered instead of the asset. This can make it easier to manage contracts around expiration dates since investors don’t need to have a closing position prior to the expiration. In addition, there’s no risk of forced delivery.
#2
European Style
Most equity options are American style, meaning they can be exercised at any point prior to expiration. European style is the opposite. These types of contracts can only be exercised upon expiration. Why does this matter? American-style options can carry higher costs to account for the fact that sellers take on more risk by not knowing when a buyer might decide to exercise their contract. Sellers of European-style options don’t have to price that risk in.
#3
Tax-Favorable Treatment
Like most other investments, options contracts are subject to taxes. However, index options benefit from a more favorable tax treatment: 40% of any gain (or loss) is taxed at the short-term capital gains rate, and 60% is taxed at the appropriate long-term tax rate. This 60/40 split is applicable even if the index option is held for less than a year.
#4
Various & Flexible Expiration Dates
Equity and index options both typically expire on the third Friday of the expiration month. But index options offer greater flexibility by allowing for AM and PM expirations. NDX has Monday, Wednesday and Friday PM expirations, as well as AM expirations for traditional third Friday monthly options.
#5
Multiple Contract Sizes
The underlying value of an equity option is 100 shares of the security. With an index option, an investor can trade reduced value options. These are designed primarily for retail investors and asset managers who handle smaller accounts since the cost is lower than trading options at the full price of the Nasdaq-100. XND is the micro value NDX index option. It provides the same broad-based exposure of the index at a fraction of the cost.
