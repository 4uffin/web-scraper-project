Opportunities Nasdaq Global Indexes Can Help Address
01
Explosion of Investable Products
We’re seeing an explosion of investment products as asset managers try to differentiate themselves in a saturated market. However, that’s adding to the overwhelm many advisors and investors had already been feeling. Meanwhile, increased competition from lower-cost players and fee compression continue to squeeze profitability. Nasdaq Solution: Total lifecycle support with co-development, co-marketing, distribution, and liquidity for $600B+ in Nasdaq-linked products.
02
Massive Shifts in Investor Demographics
At the same time, investor demographics and behavior are shifting fast. An aging population of retirees is looking for distribution. Enormous amounts of wealth are transferring to younger investors. And groups like Gen Z are using the latest tech to self-educate—which means they increasingly expect personalized service and solutions. In short, it's getting tougher to engage different individuals in all the ways—and across all the channels—they prefer. Nasdaq Solution: Market-driving innovation, including the Nasadq-100 Index®, which has outperformed the S&P 500 by 300 basis points annually, offering differentiated, future-ready solutions tailored to evolving investor needs.
03
Dynamic Macroeconomic & Regulatory Trends
All of this is happening amidst an ongoing backdrop of macroeconomic volatility. Interest rate fluctuations; underperformance of traditional/active investment vehicles; increased scrutiny around fee transparency and risk management—they’ve all raised the stakes for every decision made. Nasdaq Solution: A trusted ecosystem spanning 90 markets, partnerships with 90+ issuers, and a network of capital markets experts to ensure adaptability, resilience, and compliance.
