FAQ
What is Nasdaq Dorsey Wright?
Nasdaq Dorsey Wright is a registered investment advisory firm headquartered in Richmond, VA that specializes in technical analysis. Our expertise is in Point & Figure charting and Relative Strength analysis, which we use to analyze market data and deliver actionable insights. Our suite of technical analysis tools and investment strategies help cut through the clutter of day-to-day market action, identifying meaningful patterns in daily share price movements and momentum.
What is Point & Figure charting?
Point & Figure charting is a method of technical analysis developed by Charles Dow as a means of reducing market noise in a security chart to focus on the all-important relationship between supply and demand in the markets. We believe technical analysis offers an objective, logical approach that can reduce uncertainty in the market, aid in effectively allocating assets, and enable you to manage risk.
What is Relative Strength?
Relative Strength, also known as Momentum, has been proven to be one of the premier investment factors in use today. Numerous studies by both academics and investment professionals have demonstrated that winning securities continue to outperform and that momentum can perform well both within and across markets. Relative Strength is an adaptive, tactical investment strategy based on objective inputs like share price that is designed to participate in long-term themes of strength by providing a method for identifying market leadership. Relative Strength strategies focus on purchasing securities that have already demonstrated the ability to outperform a broad market benchmark or the other securities in the investment universe.
Why use the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Platform?
Using a clear, rules-based methodology, the platform gives you the ability to streamline your investment process with technical tools thereby freeing up your most precious commodity: your time. With tools designed to help you determine the proper asset allocation, select securities, and develop custom rules-based strategies, you can effectively manage your portfolios with greater confidence and still have time to focus on building strong, trusted relationships with every client.
What if I don't want to manage everything myself?
Nasdaq Dorsey Wright has partnered with many leading fund providers, including First Trust, iShares, and Invesco, to offer a full suite of ETFs and Mutual Funds that leverage our Relative Strength expertise and offer professional management. Additionally, Nasdaq Dorsey Wright’s own portfolio management team manages a suite of Separately Managed Accounts that focus on delivering long-term outperformance through actively managed Relative Strength portfolios.
Isn't momentum only for day traders and short-term investors?
Momentum is actually an investment factor that has been shown to work very well when implemented consistently over longer time horizons. Relative Strength’s foundational concept is that those securities, sectors, or markets that have proven the ability to outperform will continue to outperform into the future. As a result, you can use Relative Strength to develop a rules-based process for identifying leadership trends, sticking with those trends for as long as that strength remains, and adapting as new trends emerge. When applied diligently and consistently, a simple process focused on investing in leadership becomes a powerful instrument for driving long-term outperformance.
