oSumAtrIX/README.md
My interests and expertise expand from graphics-, motion- and sound design in dedicated software like Adobe Suite and Image-Line FL Studio up to programming in lots of different languages like Kotlin, Rust, C#, Java, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, MySQL, Objective-C, C, Python and Visual Basic, with the first
being my most and last being my least used languages. I mostly use my brief time productively, but I usually play chess, osu!, or Krunker if I don't.
Because of peer pressure, I generally hang around on Discord but maintain daily activity on my email inbox and a couple of other forums.
