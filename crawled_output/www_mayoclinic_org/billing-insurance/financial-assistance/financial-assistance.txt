Mayo Clinic strives to benefit humanity through work in these three areas while supporting the communities in which people live and work. Mayo Clinic appropriately serves patients in difficult financial circumstances and offers financial assistance to those who have an established need to receive medically necessary services and meet criteria for assistance.
Mayo Clinic seeks to provide support for those unable to pay for medically necessary care. This includes:
Using fair and consistent billing and collection practices, including charitable care and financial assistance policies and a standard application process
Providing extended payment plan options and medically necessary services at reduced rates or at no cost for patients eligible for financial assistance
Providing emergency care, regardless of ability to pay
Mayo Clinic determines the need for financial assistance by reviewing the medically necessary services requested by the referring provider; any care previously provided; available insurance coverage or other sources of payment; and an applicant's financial profile. This method allows for a fair and accurate way to assist patients who are experiencing financial hardship.
Required financial information may include annual household income, applicable assets, household size and confirmation of application for all sources of coverage, including Medicaid, if eligible. International patients are not generally eligible for financial assistance.
If you're experiencing financial hardship, please contact Patient Account Services to discuss options such as a payment plan or financial assistance. You may visit Registration and Business Services offices in any of the following locations:

Collaborating to Help You
Mayo Clinic collaborates with Elevate Patient Financial Solutions (ElevatePFS) to provide free financial advocacy for patients who do not have medical insurance.  ElevatePFS will work with patients to identify what assistance they may qualify for.   Special programs are available to those who meet certain eligibility requirements such as:
Eligibility-Medicaid, Medicare, COBRA
Disability (SSDI/SSI)
You may be referred to ElevatePFS if you received care from Mayo Clinic without insurance or if a financial counselor identified that you might need or qualify for more insurance coverage.

How do I apply?
The most convenient option for most people is to submit a financial assistance application through their Patient Online Services accounts.
Applying through Patient Online Services lets you submit all documentation online.
Please note that you must have a patient account already established with Mayo Clinic to use this option.
Log in or create your patient account now.
Alternatively:
A second option is to submit an electronic application and mail supporting documentation. Use these instructions to review and submit the form.
As a third option, you can print the Mayo Clinic Financial Assistance Application (PDF) and mail it along with supporting documentation.
Please note that if you choose either alternative option, you must mail or fax your supporting documentation and/or PDF application, whereas applying via Patient Online Services lets you submit the supporting documentation online.
