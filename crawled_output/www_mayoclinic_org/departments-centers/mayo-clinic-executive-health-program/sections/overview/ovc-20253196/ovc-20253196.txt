Comprehensive — customized — dedicatedMany Executive Health Program participants remark that the comprehensive nature of our executive physicals, the ability to customize the assessments based on their needs, dedicated time with physicians and the warmth of our staff are what distinguish our program.
The Executive Health Program is available at our campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida, as well as at Mayo Clinic Healthcare's London clinic in the United Kingdom.
One-on-one consultation
"Executive Health’s premier experience focuses on preventive health and wellness. Using the best integrated multi-disciplinary evaluation and health therapeutics, we meet your health goals together."
— Brian Dougan, M.D., Director of Executive Health, Mayo Clinic Rochester
We offer a comprehensive, holistic preventive health evaluation using a thorough set of evidence-based assessments to develop a complete understanding of your health status. Each executive health physical starts with an in-depth meeting with your executive health physician to understand your overall health and identify any concerns.
Our testing protocol is customized for your stage in life and any risk factors that have been identified. By scheduling a range of assessments during your visit, we develop an extensive and wide-ranging understanding of your health profile and provide you the convenience of completing these tests in one place at one time.
Executive Health Program visits conclude with a detailed meeting with your physician to review your results and develop a plan to improve your health, address any issues that were identified and target any risk factors that may impact your health.
Designed with your time in mindYour time is precious and your calendar is full. We understand. Our program works within the constraints of your schedule to provide you with efficient yet complete medical evaluations.
Spending time doing what you love
"Choosing this program is all about convenience. The efficient planning makes the best use of my time so that I can spend more time doing what I love. And of course, Mayo Clinic delivers top-quality care."
— Paul Rossberger
Comprehensive care and a seamless experiencePreventive health and wellness is different for everyone. A key to long-term success is a strong relationship with a medical provider and dedicated time to have a thorough discussion of what is required to attain and maintain peak heath.
