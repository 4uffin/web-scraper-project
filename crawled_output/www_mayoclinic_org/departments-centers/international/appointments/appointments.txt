In most cases, Mayo Clinic physicians can diagnose your condition and develop a treatment plan during your visit. Most often, doctors can give you results within a day or two after finishing tests.
For those traveling from abroad, Mayo Clinic often adjusts test scheduling, medical appointments and even surgery so that you spend less time away from home, incur lower costs, and can make better use of your and your family's time.
Make appointments directly with Mayo Clinic
In most cases, a physician referral is not necessary to set up an appointment. Many international patients schedule their own medical appointments directly with Mayo Clinic.
To request an appointment at Mayo Clinic, please email intl.isit@mayo.edu or call +1 507-738-4021. The International Appointment Office is open Monday through Friday, 07:00 – 19:00 U.S. Central Time.
