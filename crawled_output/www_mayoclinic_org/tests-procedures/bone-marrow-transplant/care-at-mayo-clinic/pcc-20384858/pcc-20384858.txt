AboutDoctors &DepartmentsCare atMayo Clinic

Mayo Clinic's approachMayo Clinic experts have extensive experience using bone marrow transplants to treat a variety of conditions, including cancers. Mayo Clinic offers bone marrow transplants for adults and children using their own cells (autologous transplant), cells from a donor (allogeneic transplant) or cells from an umbilical cord (cord blood transplant).
People who choose Mayo Clinic for their care receive comprehensive, compassionate and personalized attention from health care providers and staff who are committed to providing exactly the care they need. In addition, several support groups are offered at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.
TeamworkAt Mayo Clinic, health care providers who specialize in blood diseases (hematologists) form a multidisciplinary team with other experts to provide personalized, whole-person care to adults and children undergoing bone marrow transplants.
Your transplant team may include hematologists, cancer specialists (oncologists), mental health specialists (psychologists and psychiatrists), a bone marrow transplant scheduling coordinator, transfusion medicine nurses, trained and specialized nurses, physician assistants, social workers, a nurse coordinator, a clinical nurse specialist, a dietitian, pharmacists, a chaplain and a child life specialist for children undergoing bone marrow transplant.
Children and adolescents undergoing bone marrow transplants receive care at the Children's Center at Mayo Clinic's campus in Minnesota. At Mayo Clinic's campus in Arizona, pediatric experts collaborate with the Phoenix Children's Hospital to provide care to young patients. Together the two oversee a single bone marrow transplant program for children. Pediatric patients receive care from Mayo Clinic specialists in Florida through a partnership with Nemours Children's Specialty Care and Wolfson Children's Hospital.
Working together
Mayo Clinic health care providers and staff collaborate to provide you with exactly the care you need.
ExperienceMayo Clinic specialists have extensive experience performing bone marrow transplants for adults and children with a variety of cancerous and noncancerous diseases. Mayo's physicians have performed more than 16,300 procedures since the program began in 1972.
Providing compassionate care
Mayo Clinic experts draw on their extensive experience to provide personalized care to people considering bone marrow transplant.
Bringing research advances to patient careMayo Clinic scientists are involved in cutting-edge research that allows them to apply the latest advances to patient care.
Innovations include:
Haploidentical transplant. This type of transplant uses stem cells from donors who aren't perfect matches. Research is helping to bring understanding about how to reduce the risk of complications and improve recovery for people whose stem cell donors aren't perfect matches.
Reduced-intensity conditioning. Using lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation before a transplant may allow older people and those who aren't healthy enough for conditioning to undergo bone marrow transplants.
Cord blood transplant. This type of transplant is done using stored and frozen umbilical cord blood. There are fewer stem cells in cord blood, but those stem cells can grow more blood cells than can those collected from bone marrow. Using cells from cord blood reduces the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Researchers are identifying the best ways to use cord blood for bone marrow transplants and finding new ways to track these cells after transplant.
Expanding indications for bone marrow transplant. Researchers are studying ways to use this treatment for a wider variety of conditions, including complicated and rare diseases.
New medication options. Mayo Clinic researchers study medications and treatments for people who have had bone marrow transplants, including new medications to help people stay healthy after a bone marrow transplant.
Reduced time in the hospital. At Mayo Clinic, some bone marrow transplants are performed as hospital-based outpatient procedures, which reduces the amount of time spent in the hospital.
Nationally recognized expertiseMayo Clinic bone marrow transplant specialists are respected for their knowledge, experience and expertise.
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, and Mayo Clinic in Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona, are ranked among the Best Hospitals for cancer by U.S. News & World Report.

Social worker helps patients on transplant 'journey of cautious hope'When Tiffany Coco steps into a room at Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona, she focuses on the patient's needs beyond the medical updates. "Often, patients put their best face forward with the physicians," says Coco, "And when they talk to us, they let their guard down and open up about how transplant affects their day-to-day life." As a licensed clinical social worker embedded in multidisciplinary care teams, Coco uses her clinical expertise to assess…
FISH testing helps detect unseen cancer cellsOn the brink of losing her battle with acute myeloid leukemia, Shannon Camlek arrived at Mayo Clinic as a last hope. Her chances didn’t look good, but with the help of specialized genetic testing, particularly FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) studies, doctors were able to detect the specific gene mutations responsible for her symptoms and disease. The test results also helped Shannon’s care team target her treatment accordingly, and finally put an end to what…
No Place Like Home: David Elder's Post-Transplant Care a 'Blessing'When David Elder’s back started to hurt in the fall of 2022, he thought his recurrent spasms had returned. But when medication didn’t help like before, his doctor sent him to the ER – and soon after, he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a treatable but incurable form of cancer that had caused several painful breaks in his spine. “It just hit us out of nowhere,” he says of the diagnosis. “It was shocking.” Five…

EligibilityIf your bone marrow stops working or doesn't produce healthy stem cells, you may benefit from a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants are used to treat people whose stem cells have been damaged by disease or the treatment of a disease, or as a way to have the donor's immune system fight a blood disorder, such as leukemia.
Experts will determine whether a bone marrow transplant may be safe and beneficial for you. Your treatment team will explain the benefits and risks of a bone marrow transplant.
Your treatment team will also evaluate you to determine whether a bone marrow transplant or an alternative therapy may be the most appropriate treatment option for your condition.

Costs and insuranceBone marrow transplant costs and insurance informationMayo Clinic has dedicated transplant financial services representatives and social workers who can assist you with insurance and financial questions regarding your transplant.
Mayo Clinic works with hundreds of insurance companies and is an in-network provider for millions of people. In most cases, Mayo Clinic doesn't require a physician referral. Some insurers require referrals or may have additional requirements for certain medical care. Many insurance companies require you to get preapproval authorization prior to transplant services.
Insurance informationBefore your transplant, it's important that you work closely with your insurance company to understand your benefit plan. You'll be responsible for any of your transplant and medical care costs not covered by your insurance company.
You may want to ask your insurance company several questions regarding your transplant expenses, including:
What is the specific coverage of my plan? What are my deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, lifetime maximum amount and annual maximum amounts for both medical care and transplant services?
Does my plan have a preexisting or waiting period clause? If so, what is the time frame? Can this be waived?
Does my plan include pharmacy coverage? If so, will my plan cover my current medications and immunosuppressant medications?
Does my plan require any special approvals for evaluation or transplant? How long does the approval process take once submitted to insurance?
Does my plan cover my transportation and lodging expenses during my transplant care?
Does my current insurance require enrollment in Medicare when eligible?
Does my insurance follow Medicare Coordination of Benefits guidelines?
How will my current coverage change after enrolling in Medicare? Will my plan become a supplemental or secondary plan?
If your plan is a Medicare supplement, ask questions including:
Does my plan follow Medicare guidelines?
Does my plan cover Medicare Part A and B deductible and coinsurance?
Does my plan have a preexisting or waiting period? If so, what is the time frame?
Does my plan offer an option for Medicare Part D coverage?
Other expensesPlease plan for other expenses that may occur related to your transplant, which may include follow-up medical appointments, long-term medications, caregiver expenses, travel, parking, lodging and other expenses.
If you have an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, your donor's transplant-related medical care may be paid by your insurance company.
For international patientsMayo Clinic has dedicated international patient account representatives who can assist you with questions regarding your costs and insurance. Read more about international financial services.
Case managersMayo Clinic financial staff will work closely with your case managers from your insurance company. Your case manager, who is assigned to you, is available to answer questions and calls related to your insurance costs.
