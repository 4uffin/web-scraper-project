Mayo Clinic's approach
Team approach
At Mayo Clinic, a team of doctors and staff work together to evaluate and treat people who may need lung transplants.
Multidisciplinary team approachAt Mayo Clinic, doctors trained in lung conditions (pulmonologists), chest surgery (thoracic surgeons), heart surgery (cardiac surgeons), infectious disease management, mental health conditions (psychiatrists) and other specialties may collaborate as a multidisciplinary team to provide you with coordinated, comprehensive care. Doctors work together with health care professionals in many areas to evaluate you, determine your eligibility for a lung transplant, perform your lung transplant and coordinate follow-up care.
Care team roles
Health care professionals trained in many medical specialties work together as a team to ensure favorable outcomes from your lung transplant.
Common recommendations and treatment at Mayo ClinicMayo Clinic's Transplant Center staff at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota works together to evaluate and treat people who may need a lung transplant. Mayo Clinic offers common recommendations, evaluation processes, treatment, post-surgical care and follow-up care for lung transplant candidates at Mayo Clinic's campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. Mayo Clinic uses technology to help make patient information available as needed at campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota.
Mayo Clinic staff coordinates care as needed between the three sites. You may be evaluated for a lung transplant at one Mayo Clinic location, but you may have a lung transplant at another location if it's in your best interests. If you have your evaluation and transplant surgery at different locations, Mayo staff from both locations collaborates as a team to provide you with comprehensive care through the transplant process.
After transplant, pulmonary rehabilitation is offered at each Mayo Clinic campus.
Individualized approach
Individualized care
Mayo Clinic doctors take the time to discuss each person's individual needs.
Mayo doctors take the time to get to know you and work with you to provide exactly the care you need. Your doctors and transplant team will work with you and discuss your individual needs to determine the most appropriate treatment for you.
The opportunity to share your experienceMayo Clinic has a Transplantation at Mayo Clinic Facebook page dedicated to helping transplant recipients and donors connect to each other online. Mayo Clinic also offers a Transplants group in Mayo Clinic Connect.
Multiorgan transplant experienceMayo Clinic offers the full spectrum of options for lung transplantation, including multi-organ transplant procedures such as heart-lung transplantation. Mayo Clinic doctors and surgeons have experience evaluating and treating people with complex conditions who may need multiorgan transplants.
A team of doctors trained in a wide array of specialties works together in Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center to treat people who may need multiorgan transplants.
Collaboration
Mayo Clinic doctors collaborate to provide care for people who may need lung transplants.
Research and innovationMayo doctors conduct research in diagnostic tests and treatments for a variety of lung diseases.
Mayo Clinic researchers in the Transplant Center conduct ongoing studies and clinical trials in improving surgical procedures, improving outcomes and caring for people who need transplants. Researchers also study alternative therapies for people who may not need a transplant.
For example, Mayo doctors study potential ways of using stem cell therapy to treat many lung conditions in lung regeneration research. Researchers study how reprogrammed stem cells can be turned into specialized cells that can replace, repair or regenerate diseased lung cells.
Mayo Clinic is also creating a lung restoration center with the goal of increasing the number of lungs available for transplant at Mayo Clinic and other transplant centers throughout the United States. At the lung restoration center at Mayo Clinic's campus in Florida, a team conducts trials hoping to preserve and restore donor lungs — using a method called ex vivo lung perfusion — so donor lungs that previously may not have been appropriate for transplant can be used in lung transplantation.
Work at the lung restoration center will support and extend Mayo's regenerative medicine research program.
Mayo Clinic researchers also study medications and treatments for people with lung transplants, including new medications (immunosuppressant medications) to keep the body from rejecting a lung transplant.
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, Mayo Clinic in Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona, and Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, are ranked among the Best Hospitals for respiratory disorders by U.S. News and World Report.
