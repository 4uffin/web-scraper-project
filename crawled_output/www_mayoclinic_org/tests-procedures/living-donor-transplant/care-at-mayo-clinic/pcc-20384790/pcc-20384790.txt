Mayo Clinic's approach
Living-donor transplant consultation at Mayo Clinic
Start your donor evaluation
Begin the process of becoming a living kidney or liver donor by clicking here to complete a health history questionnaire.
Living-Donor Toolkit
Learn what transplant recipients and living donors can expect: tests, screening, the procedures, risks, recovery, financial information and more.
Mayo Clinic has one of the largest transplant practices in the United States. Our transplant doctors, surgeons and other transplant staff members at the Mayo Clinic campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota have extensive experience with living-donor kidney and liver transplantation.
The living-donor process at Mayo Clinic starts with completing a health history questionnaire.
Care team roles
Health care professionals trained in many medical specialties work together as a team to ensure favorable outcomes for living donors.
Team approach. Mayo Clinic's integrated teams of surgeons, doctors, transplant nurses, pharmacists and others work together to provide your care, from your evaluation through post-surgery care.
The transplant team will evaluate you to determine if you can donate a kidney or part of your liver. You'll have blood tests as well as a thorough physical examination and psychological evaluation. Several other tests, including detailed imaging of your liver or kidneys, will be performed to ensure that you're in good health and you meet donation criteria.
After you donate an organ, living-donor coordinators and other transplant staff members will offer you support and follow-up care for several months after your surgery.
Coordinated care. Having all of this subspecialized expertise in a single place, focused on you, means that you're not just getting one opinion — your care is discussed among the team, your test results are available quickly, appointments are scheduled in coordination, and your transplant care team works together to determine what may be most appropriate for you.
Surgical expertise. Mayo Clinic surgeons perform living-donor transplant surgery for liver transplant and kidney transplant. Surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery to remove a living donor's kidney (laparoscopic donor nephrectomy) for a kidney transplant, which is less painful and has a shorter recovery time for the donor compared with open surgery.
Research. Mayo Clinic researchers actively study the health of donors after transplant surgery to improve results. At Mayo Clinic, you may have access to ongoing clinical trials, research and new treatments as part of your living-donor transplantation experience.

A living legacy: Donors who give hope and healingCharnel Golis-Tabag stands with sign showing why she donated a kidney When Charnel Golis-Tabag picked up her sister from the airport in her home state of Hawaii, she didn't expect to hear that her sister's kidney function had dropped below 11%. That moment changed everything. "She told me she was on the transplant list," Charnel recalls. "Two days later, I called Mayo Clinic to start the living kidney donation process." Charnel had seen too many…
