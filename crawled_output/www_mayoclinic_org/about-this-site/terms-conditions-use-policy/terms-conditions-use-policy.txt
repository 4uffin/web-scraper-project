Payment. A valid credit card number, expiration date, and card security code is required for all purchases on the Mayo Clinic Store and Mayo Clinic Marketplace. If we are unable to charge the full cost of your purchase to the credit card you provide, we may cancel your order or request an alternate form of payment. Mayo Clinic's designated credit card processor will collect your credit card information and related personal information for its use in processing your payment for the products or services ordered by you. Any complaints or grievances regarding the processing of your payment should be addressed to Mayo Clinic at mayoclinicsupport@mayoclinic.com. You understand that the prices for products and services may be changed from time to time.
If you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process. If you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online. This may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.

If a Provider prescribes a Prescription Product, he/she will limit supply based upon state regulations and will only prescribe a Prescription Product as determined in his/her own discretion and professional judgment. There is no guarantee a prescription will be written. You agree that any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider will be solely for your personal use. You agree to fully and carefully read all provided product information and labels and to contact a physician or pharmacist if you have any questions regarding the prescription. Mayo Clinic fully honors patient freedom of choice and, if you receive a prescription for a Prescription Product from Mayo Clinic or a Mayo Provider, you always have the option to instruct Mayo Clinic to transmit that prescription to the pharmacy of your choice. Any questions about prescriptions for Mayo Clinic Store purchases should be directed to accounts@store.mayoclinic.com.
Responsibility for charges and fees; Insurance. You are solely responsible for all charges and applicable fees (including delivery charges, taxes and any fees assessed by your bank) associated with your order from the Mayo Clinic Store. Some products or charges may be eligible for payment or reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, out-of-state workers' compensation payer, or other insurance plan. Regardless of insurance coverage and reimbursement amounts, you will be responsible for the purchase price and all charges associated with your order and product purchase. Any questions about insurance coverage for Mayo Clinic Store purchases should be directed to accounts@store.mayoclinic.com.
