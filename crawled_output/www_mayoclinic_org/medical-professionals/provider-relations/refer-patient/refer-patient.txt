Why refer to Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic respects the relationships you have with your patients and is committed to open communication and prompt follow-up after your patient is seen.
We recognize that your patient looks to you as his or her primary provider — and we expect to entrust your patient back to your ongoing care after being seen at Mayo Clinic. Mayo sees patients from all walks of life and is an in-network provider for millions of people. To refer a patient, you don't need to know a Mayo Clinic staff member or have a previous relationship with us. Let us collaborate with you to provide the highest quality patient care.
Quality and expertise. Mayo Clinic is continually developing new diagnosis and treatment techniques and refining and improving existing ones. Mayo Clinic has tertiary and quaternary expertise found in few other medical centers, including novel treatment options and clinical trials.
Collaboration. Working together with medical professionals in the community and around the world has been part of Mayo's culture since our founding over 150 years ago. Let us collaborate with you to provide the highest quality patient care.
Ease. Click, call or fax — we offer several ways to refer patients, all streamlined to save time for you and your colleagues. Use Mayo Clinic CareLink when it's convenient for you to view patient appointment times and subsequent clinical notes and test results.
Locations. We have major campuses in three regions of the U.S. — Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Phoenix/Scottsdale, Arizona — as well as Mayo Clinic Health System locations that serve more than 60 communities in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota. This offers your patients multiple ways to access Mayo Clinic, no matter where they live.

With CareLink, you can submit referrals at anytime, you can also submit records and images. In addition, you can see the progress of your referral, view the patient's upcoming itinerary, and look at notes or records from the Mayo Clinic team. Signing up takes just a few minutes. Click on "Create your account". Simply request an account for your organization, and then for each user. Requests will be processed in about seven business days. Once approved, you will be notified via email.
This is the Mayo Clinic CareLink homepage. There are tabs across the top, as well as additional links on the page. Let's take a quick look at some key features. Click on "Upcoming appointments" to view your patient's future visits to Mayo Clinic. Click on "Requests" to monitor the progress of a record request you have already submitted.

These patients will remain on your active list for 120 days after you have taken action on them. The patient's name is clickable, allowing you to take additional action such as viewing their records or submitting a referral. When ordering a referral, you will be able to share information including the reason for the referral, scheduling instructions, upload records or images, and general comments for the Mayo Clinic provider. Your order screen will vary based on the type of request. Here's an example of an ancillary service order page.
