Heart valve disease care at Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic team discussion
A team of doctors collaborate and discuss heart valve disease.
Your Mayo Clinic care teamAt Mayo Clinic, doctors trained in heart disease (cardiologists), doctors trained in heart surgery (cardiovascular surgeons) and other heart valve disease specialists work together to provide you with coordinated, comprehensive care. This collaborative approach means your care team can often evaluate you and develop a treatment plan within 2 to 3 days.
Advanced diagnosis and treatmentMayo Clinic offers many diagnostic tests and treatment options for heart valve disease, including aortic valve disease, mitral valve disease, pulmonary valve disease and tricuspid valve disease.
Your Mayo Clinic care team uses advanced imaging techniques to accurately diagnose heart valve disease and other heart conditions. These techniques include echocardiography, 3D echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography.
Imaging discussion
Mayo Clinic doctors collaborate and discuss a 3D echocardiogram.
Research and technology at Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic doctors discuss research and technology, such as the 3D printing of models of the heart.
Innovative heart valve surgeryMayo Clinic heart surgeons have experience and training in innovative techniques used to perform heart valve surgery. When possible, surgeons repair heart valves instead of replacing them.
Robot-assisted heart surgery at Mayo Clinic
A Mayo Clinic surgeon sits at a remote computer station and uses finger tools to control the arms of a robot to do robot-assisted heart surgery. A surgical team assists at the operating table.
Mayo surgeons may perform minimally invasive heart surgery, which involves the use of smaller incisions than those used in open-heart surgery. Sometimes, doctors perform robot-assisted heart surgery to repair heart valves.
Mayo doctors may do less invasive heart procedures using long, thin tubes called catheters to repair or replace some heart valves. Sometimes clips or plugs are used to make the repairs.
Expertise and rankingsMayo Clinic cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and other care professionals have experience diagnosing and treating all types of heart valve disease. Each year, Mayo doctors evaluate or treat about 37,000 people with heart valve disease.
