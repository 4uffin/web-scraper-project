Adult congenital heart disease care at Mayo ClinicYour Mayo Clinic care teamMayo Clinic doctors trained in heart disease (cardiologists) and heart surgery (cardiovascular surgeons) have experience evaluating and treating adults with congenital heart disease and all types of heart conditions.
Collaborative care. Mayo cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and other health professionals work together to provide coordinated, comprehensive care. This collaborative approach means that they can often evaluate you and develop a treatment plan within 2 to 3 days. Mayo Clinic provides care for you as a whole person. We take the time to get to know you and work with you to provide exactly the care you need.
