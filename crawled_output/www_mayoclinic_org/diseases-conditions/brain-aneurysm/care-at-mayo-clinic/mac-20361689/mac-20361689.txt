Brain aneurysm care at Mayo ClinicYour Mayo Clinic care team
Mayo Clinic neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and others work together for brain aneurysm care.
Mayo Clinic specialists trained in brain conditions (neurologists), brain surgery (neurosurgeons) and endovascular treatments (neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists) have experience treating people who have brain aneurysms and other brain and blood vessel conditions, also called cerebrovascular diseases.
Mayo Clinic's team approach means your healthcare professionals often can diagnose your particular condition and develop a treatment plan within a few days.
Advanced diagnosis and treatment
Highly ranked Mayo Clinic doctors use CT scanning, MRI, computerized tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, cerebral arteriography, cerebrospinal fluid examination and other tests to diagnose and treat brain aneurysm.
The latest diagnostic tests. Mayo Clinic experts evaluate people who have brain aneurysms with computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, cerebral arteriography, cerebrospinal fluid examination and other tests.
Your healthcare professional may use these tests to diagnose an unruptured aneurysm and determine its size, location and other characteristics and assess the aneurysm's risk of rupture. Healthcare professionals also use these tests to diagnose a ruptured aneurysm, which needs emergency treatment.
Treatment expertise. Mayo Clinic specialists have wide and varied expertise treating brain aneurysms using the most current approaches:
Endovascular techniques such as coiling or coiling in combination with stenting.
Flow diverters for larger or more complex aneurysms.
Other new endovascular techniques and surgery.
Experience. Mayo Clinic is one of the nation's largest treatment and research centers for cerebrovascular diseases.
Individualized treatment. Mayo Clinic specialists work closely with you to develop an individualized treatment plan to prevent brain hemorrhage. The plan is based on your brain aneurysm's size and location and other aneurysm features. It's also based on the predicted risk of rupture, consideration of any family history of aneurysm rupture, your medical condition and your preference after consulting with your Mayo Clinic healthcare professionals.
Research. Mayo Clinic specialists conduct research in potential causes, risks, diagnostic tests and treatments for brain aneurysms and other brain conditions and conduct clinical trials.
