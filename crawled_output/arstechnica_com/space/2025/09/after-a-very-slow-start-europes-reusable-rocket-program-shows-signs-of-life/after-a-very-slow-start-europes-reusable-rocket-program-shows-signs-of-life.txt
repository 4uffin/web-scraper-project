Themis not on their side
After a very slow start, Europe’s reusable rocket program shows signs of life
Although Themis is making progress, the program is several years behind schedule.

No one could accuse the European Space Agency and its various contractors of moving swiftly when it comes to the development of reusable rockets. However, it appears that Europe is finally making some credible progress.
This week, the France-based ArianeGroup aerospace company announced that it had completed the integration of the Themis vehicle, a prototype rocket that will test various landing technologies, on a launch pad in Sweden. Low-altitude hop tests, a precursor for developing a rocket's first stage that can vertically land after an orbital launch, could start late this year or early next.
"This milestone marks the beginning of the 'combined tests,' during which the interface between Themis and the launch pad's mechanical, electrical, and fluid systems will be thoroughly trialed, with the aim of completing a test under cryogenic conditions," the company said.
Finally getting going
The advancement of the Themis program represents a concrete step forward for Europe, which has had a delayed and somewhat confusing response to the rise of reusable rockets a decade ago.
After several years of development and testing, including the Grasshopper program in Texas to demonstrate vertical landing, SpaceX landed its first orbital rocket in December 2015. Weeks earlier, Blue Origin landed the much smaller New Shepard vehicle after a suborbital hop. This put the industry on notice that first stage reuse was on the horizon.
At this point, the European Space Agency had already committed to a new medium-lift rocket, the Ariane 6, and locked in a traditional design that would not incorporate any elements of reuse. Most of its funding focused on developing the Ariane 6.
However, by the middle of 2017, the space agency began to initiate programs that would eventually lead to a reusable launch vehicle. They included:
Prometheus engine: In mid-2017, the space agency started funding the reusable Prometheus engine, fueled by methane and liquid oxygen, with a thrust comparable to SpaceX's Merlin 1-D engine. Designed by ArianeGroup, Prometheus completed two long test firing campaigns this year.
Callisto program: France, Germany, and Japan began collaborating in late 2017 to develop a subscale demonstrator of vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies. It was a smaller-scale version of SpaceX's Grasshopper program and used propulsion based on liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Flights of this vehicle have been repeatedly delayed, and now will occur no earlier than 2027.
Themis program: This program started later, but is further along. After Themis' adoption by member states in November 2019, The European Space Agency contracted directly with ArianeGroup to build a first stage rocket, with landing legs, and using the Prometheus engine. This program sought to be less experimental than Callisto, and feed directly into a rocket that could succeed Ariane 6. This is the vehicle on the pad in Sweden.
So what’s next?
The Themis T1H vehicle will likely undergo only short hops, initially about 100 meters. A follow-up vehicle, Themis T1E, is intended to fly medium-altitude tests at a later date. Some of the learnings from these prototypes will feed into a smaller, reusable rocket intended to lift 500 kg to low-Earth orbit. This is under development by MaiaSpace, a subsidiary of ArianeGroup.
Eventually, the European Space Agency would like to use technology developed as part of Themis to develop a new line of reusable rockets that will succeed the Ariane 6 rocket.
Although Themis is making progress, it's worth noting that the program is several years behind schedule. At its inception in late 2019, Themis was intended to make its first hop tests in 2022.
It also underscores how far Europe has fallen behind SpaceX and other competitors in reusable launch technology. SpaceX began its first Grasshopper tests in 2012, landed an orbital booster in 2015, and re-flew a first stage for the first time in 2017. Other US companies, including Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and Stoke Space, plan to launch and land orbital rockets in the next two years, along with a host of Chinese companies.
