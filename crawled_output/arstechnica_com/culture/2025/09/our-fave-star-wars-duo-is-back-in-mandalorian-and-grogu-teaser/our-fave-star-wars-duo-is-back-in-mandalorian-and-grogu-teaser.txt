Our fave Star Wars duo is back in Mandalorian and Grogu teaser
There is almost no dialogue and little hint of the plot, but the visuals should delight fans.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has been under fire for several days now for pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air "indefinitely," with Disney+'s cancellation page actually crashing a couple of times from all the traffic as people rushed to make their displeasure known. So what better time for the studio to release the first teaser trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, a feature film spinoff from its megahit Star Wars series The Mandalorian? Grogu and Mando, together again on an exciting space adventure, will certainly be a crowd-pleaser.
Grogu (aka Baby Yoda) won viewers' hearts from the moment he first appeared onscreen in the first season of The Mandalorian, and the relationship between the little green creature and his father-figure bounty hunter has only gotten stronger. With the 2023 Hollywood strikes delaying production on S4 of the series, director Jon Favreau got the green light to make this spinoff film.
Per the official logline:
The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.
In addition to Pascal, the cast includes Sigourney Weaver as Ward, a veteran pilot, colonel, and leader of the New Republic's Adelphi Rangers. Jeremy Allen White plays Rotta the Hutt (son of Jabba, first introduced in 2008's The Clone Wars), Jonny Coyne reprises his Mandalorian S3 role as an Imperial warlord leading a surviving faction of the Galactic Empire, and we can expect to see Garazeb ("Zeb") Orrelios from the Star Wars Rebels animated series, too. And yes, that's a shiny new version of Mando's ship (destroyed in S2).

The teaser opens with a shot of the Razor Crest approaching a sandy beach. Cut to Mando and Grogu crouched behind a sand dune as Grogu looks through a telescope to monitor Stormtroopers at a military base. We also see the pair have a sit-down with Weaver's Ward, who refuses to allow a mischievous Grogu to use the Force to steal her snacks. There are lightsaber fights, robot battles, and exploding AT-ATs. Grogu swims. Rotta appears to wild cheers in what seems to be a fighting tournament featuring other monstrous alien species.
There is almost no dialogue and little hint about the film's plot, but the visuals should delight fans. The Mandalorian and Grogu hits theaters on May 22, 2026.
