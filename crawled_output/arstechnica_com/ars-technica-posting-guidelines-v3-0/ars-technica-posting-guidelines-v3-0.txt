The Ars OpenForum and article discussion threads are moderated by a group of Ars staff and volunteer moderators who make complex judgment calls for the benefit of the community as a whole. These Posting Guidelines form the core of this effort, establishing a set of rules to foster open, frank, and diverse discussions.
These Posting Guidelines work in concert with the Conde Nast User Agreement and the Ars Technica Addendum (protecting your rights to your own posted content).
Most infractions will come with a warning. Stacking warnings or ignoring moderation directives will result in longer temporary bans and ultimately a permanent ban.
Particularly egregious violations may result in the omission of the warning process altogether, and accounts without an established posting history may be banned outright at our discretion.
Our goal at all times is to promote the well-being of our community and maintain conversations that are respectful and productive.
The Posting Guidelines
Ad hominem or personal attacks against other community members (including Ars staff) are prohibited.
No posting content that is hateful, violent, or that victimizes, degrades, defiles or disparages any group based on race, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, or age, or otherwise engage in what we deem to be racism, sexism, ageism, religious intolerance, bigotry, ethnic slurs, or homophobia.
No trolling. In general, this means avoiding posts that are inflammatory and intended to rile people up, but it will always be a matter of moderator judgment.
No pornographic, sexually offensive, sexually explicit, or objectifying material is allowed.
Respect the privacy of others. Do not post others' private phone numbers, addresses, pictures, etc., without permission.
Abuse of editing privileges is not permitted. Users may not delete/edit content to evade possible moderation (removing flames, trolls, etc.). Do not edit quotes in your own posts to change what people said.
Each forum member is limited to one account.
Do not use Ars to spread misinformation. Moderators are not the argument police, but promoting unscientific or false narratives about things like vaccinations, water fluoridation, or climate change may lead to bans, possibly permanent.
Pay attention to moderation directives, and refrain from arguing moderation in-thread. No armchair moderating. Start a thread in the Feedback forum if you wish to debate a matter of moderation.
Even with all of this spelled out, there is still plenty of gray area. Moderators will always use their best judgment in moderation.
How moderation works
The moderators have the following tools:
Moderation directives in threads. Directives might be to stop going off-topic, to refrain from hostility, or to cease some other ongoing concern that has not yet warranted outright moderation.
Issuing private warnings that are logged to your account. Warnings can be permanent or set to expire at a specific time. Accumulating multiple warnings will result in increased ban lengths.
Thread Eject can be used to eject someone from a specific thread, making it impossible for them to continue contributing to said thread. This does not constitute a warning and will not be recorded on your permanent record. Ejections can be temporary or permanent.
Temporary Bans can be issued for periods ranging from a few hours to as long as a month.
Permanent Bans can be issued, which effectively bar someone from future participation in the community.
