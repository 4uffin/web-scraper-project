Developers joke about “coding like cavemen” as AI service suffers major outage
Anthropic outage takes down AI tools some developers rely on to create software.

On Wednesday afternoon, Anthropic experienced a brief but complete service outage that took down its AI infrastructure, leaving developers unable to access Claude.ai, the API, Claude Code, or the management console for around half an hour. The outage affected all three of Anthropic's main services simultaneously, with the company posting at 12:28 pm Eastern that "APIs, Console, and Claude.ai are down. Services will be restored as soon as possible." As of press time, the services appear to be restored.
The disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. "Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow," joked one Hacker News commenter. Another user recalled a joke from a previous AI outage: "Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024."
The most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user observed: "It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages." Another user also noted this pattern, saying that "early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle."
While some users criticized Anthropic for reliability issues in recent months, the company's status page acknowledged the issue within 39 minutes of the initial reports, and by 12:55 pm Eastern announced that a fix had been implemented and that the company's teams were monitoring the results.
Growing dependency on AI coding tools
The speed at which news of the outage spread shows how deeply embedded AI coding assistants have already become in modern software development. Claude Code, announced in February and widely launched in May, is Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent that can perform multi-step coding tasks across an existing code base.
The tool competes with OpenAI's Codex feature, a coding agent that generates production-ready code in isolated containers, Google's Gemini CLI, Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which itself can use Claude models for code, and Cursor, a popular AI-powered IDE built on VS Code that also integrates multiple AI models, including Claude.
During today's outage, some developers turned to alternative solutions. "Z.AI works fine. Qwen works fine. Glad I switched," posted one user on Hacker News. Others joked about reverting to older methods, with one suggesting the "pseudo-LLM experience" could be achieved with a Python package that imports code directly from Stack Overflow.
While AI coding assistants have accelerated development for some users, they've also caused problems for others who rely on them too heavily. The emerging practice of so-called "vibe coding"—using natural language to generate and execute code through AI models without fully understanding the underlying operations—has led to catastrophic failures.
In recent incidents, Google's Gemini CLI destroyed user files while attempting to reorganize them, and Replit's AI coding service deleted a production database despite explicit instructions not to modify code. These failures occurred when the AI models confabulated successful operations and built subsequent actions on false premises, highlighting the risks of depending on AI assistants that can misinterpret file structures or fabricate data to hide their errors.
Wednesday's outage served as a reminder that as dependency on AI grows, even minor service disruptions can become major events that affect an entire profession. But perhaps that could be a good thing if it's an excuse to take a break from a stressful workload. As one commenter joked, it might be "time to go outside and touch some grass again."
