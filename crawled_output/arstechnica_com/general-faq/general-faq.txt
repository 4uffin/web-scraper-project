Welcome to our FAQ. Below are some of the more common questions we get asked, and their answers. Feel free to contact us if your answer is not addressed below, but we do ask that you check the FAQ first, to ensure the best service possible.
Do you accept news tips / suggestions?
We love tips, we really do. Steak tips, news tips, you name it. Hit our contact page to let us know what you'd like to share. If you want credit for passing along a tip, be sure to let us know.
Where can I get help with my subscription?
We're glad you asked. Check out our subscriber support page for more information!
How do I contact the OpenForum moderators?
Information on contacting our moderation team is available here. Please note that we receive many moderation requests, often stemming from the same incident or post. We do not always respond to reports, but we do investigate all of them.
I sent Ars an email, and never heard back. Are you ignoring me?
The spam filtering on the Ars mail server is set to reject anything vaguely suspicious. Kill the HTML and eliminate any words frequently associated with porn, drugs, or lottery winnings, and your mail has a better chance to get through.
That said, we collectively receive thousands of emails every day, and simply cannot respond to all of them. We read your messages, we really do. If you are looking for interaction, we do recommend  that you use the discussion threads for articles and reports, and that you turn to the OpenForum for general technology questions.
How can I correct the record? a.k.a., You made an error!
If you think you've spotted an error of syntax, style, or fact, please let us know using the contact form, and selecting "Corrections." Generally speaking, posting in the comments is not a reliable way to notify our editors of critical problems.
Why was my comment edited or erased?
While the OpenForum is a wild and fun place, we take the discussion threads of our articles quite seriously. To keep them on topic, we routinely remove comments that point out errors that we can fix. No one wants to see "hey dude, you made a typo" as the first post in a discussion if it has already been corrected. We also reserve the right to remove any and all spam, and we will also remove posts that are highly offensive in nature.
