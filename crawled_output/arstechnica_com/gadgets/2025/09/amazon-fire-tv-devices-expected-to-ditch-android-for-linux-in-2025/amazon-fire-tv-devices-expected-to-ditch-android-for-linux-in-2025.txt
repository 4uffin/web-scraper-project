After the posting—and apparent editing—of a job opening spotted this week, it's expected that Amazon will bring its homegrown operating system to Fire TV devices this year.
Most of Amazon’s Fire-branded devices, which include tablets, currently run some version of Fire OS, which is an Android fork based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is based on 2020’s Android 11.
Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS. The current Echo Hub smart home control panel, Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) smart home display, and Echo Spot smart speaker all run an OS based on the Linux 5.16 kernel, per details in Amazon’s source code notice for Alexa devices. However, Amazon has never publicly acknowledged that the OS exists.
A new job listing, as seen by Lowpass’ Janko Roettgers, however, points to the OS coming to Fire TV devices this year. In an archived version of the job listing that Lowpass shared from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, Amazon seeks a software development manager for the “Prime Video Fire TV" team who will have “full responsibility for the Vega OS experience.” The job listing continues:
The team is responsible for the dedicated Prime Video app on Vega OS, as well as all [Prime Video] experiences on the Vega Launcher. With the app launching in 2025, you will get to shape the future of this product as well as the culture of the team.
Lowpass reported that the job listing's language was edited to remove mentions of Vega after Roettgers asked Amazon for comment. Amazon has declined to comment. You can see the job listing here.
Notably, Amazon isn’t expected to update current Fire TV devices with Vega, Lowpass reported today.
Breaking away from Google
Amazon is not publicly saying so, but it would be smart for it to own the OS used in its proprietary streaming devices. Having full control over the OS running Fire streaming sticks, boxes, and TVs would give Amazon a stronger footing in one of the fastest-growing consumer tech markets. Seeking recurring revenue over hardware unit sales, TV industry players have been shifting focus toward software, and OS operators are seeing success in monetizing ads, tracking, and services.
Vega would also give Amazon greater flexibility and power in integrating Alexa+, the new generative AI voice assistant that it's desperate to monetize, with its streaming devices. Because of the potential for generative AI to bring valuable smart TV capabilities, such as suggesting content based on conversational requests from viewers, Fire TVs may be one of Amazon's best shots at making money from its AI assistant.
Lessening dependence on Google could also help Amazon expand its streaming business. In 2022, Amazon accused Google of preventing Android partners from creating third-party Fire TVs. Soon after, Protocol reported that Amazon and Google made a deal allowing some TV OEMs, like Hisense, to make Fire TVs. Google and Amazon never publicly confirmed such an agreement, but a proprietary OS would help Amazon break from any expectations that might have been set by Google.
Finally, running Android on streaming devices comes with unnecessary cruft, as the code required for smartphones is not needed in devices like smart TVs.
Lowpass cited three anonymous sources who claimed that Amazon will announce Vega OS for TVs at its devices event planned for New York City on Tuesday. However, Amazon has been expected to announce Vega before, but it has not.
