Report: Apple inches closer to releasing an OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro
More iPad-like Mac hardware would balance Apple’s push for Mac-like iPads.

At multiple points over many years, Apple executives have taken great pains to point out that they think touchscreen Macs are a silly idea. But it remains one of those persistent Mac rumors that crops up over and over again every couple of years, from sources that are reliable enough that they shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand.
Today’s contribution comes from supply chain analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who usually has some insight into what Apple is testing and manufacturing. Kuo says that touchscreen MacBook Pros are “expected to enter mass production by late 2026,” and that the devices will also shift to using OLED display panels instead of the Mini LED panels on current-generation MacBook Pros.
Kuo says that Apple’s interest in touchscreen Macs comes from “long-term observation of iPad user behavior.” Apple’s tablet hardware launches in the last few years have also included keyboard and touchpad accessories, and this year’s iPadOS 26 update in particular has helped to blur the line between the touch-first iPad and the keyboard-and-pointer-first Mac. In other words, Apple has already acknowledged that both kinds of input can be useful when combined in the same device; taking that same jump on the Mac feels like a natural continuation of work Apple is already doing.
Touchscreens became much more common on Windows PCs starting in 2012 when Windows 8 was released, itself a response to Apple’s introduction of the iPad a couple of years before. Microsoft backed off on almost all of Windows 8’s design decisions in the following years after the dramatic UI shift proved unpopular with traditional mouse-and-keyboard users, but touchscreen PCs like Microsoft’s Surface lineup have persisted even as the software has changed.
The last major contribution to The Great Touchscreen Mac Rumor Cycle came from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in early 2023. Gurman claimed that Apple was “actively engaged” in designing and testing touchscreen Macs, but that we probably wouldn’t see the fruits of that labor until 2025 at the earliest. Apple still has a little bit of 2025 left to go, but it does seem as though the company is going to miss that time window.
Kuo’s post also makes reference to another perennial Mac rumor: the existence of a low-cost MacBook model that slides in well underneath the $999 baseline that Apple’s entry-level laptops have stuck to for a couple of decades now. Kuo claims this Mac is entering production in the fourth quarter of 2025, suggesting that we could see it in the next few months.
This low-cost MacBook is said to use an A-series iPhone processor to cut costs, and it seems likely that it would be a replacement of sorts for the old M1 MacBook Air that Apple still sells through Walmart for $650 (currently $600). If Apple introduced a low-cost MacBook, one big question would be whether it would remain retailer-exclusive, or if Apple would sell it in its own stores like it has done with its low-cost iPhone and iPad models.
