Google has so many products that it can be near-impossible to keep track. And yet, the company has rarely created desktop apps to go with those services. There are a handful, like Drive and Quick Share, but the company's flagship product is only now coming to the desktop. The new Google app for Windows is available now, allowing you to search the web, Google Drive, and even your local files.
The company stresses that the new app is experimental—it's limited to personal Google accounts, and you may encounter some bugs. The core functionality appears to be solid because it's not trying to do too much. After installation, you can press Alt+Space (or a shortcut of your choice) at any time to bring up a floating Google search bar. Just type your query, and the results page appears in a small window directly below the bar. It can also pull in select Knowledge Graph content, so you may not even have to type the whole query to get the information you need.
Microsoft's built-in Windows search functionality is notoriously crummy, and even in this experimental form, Google's Chrome OS-style search experience is better. It's fast, pulling up local files, Drive documents, and installed apps in a single interface. Both local files and Drive are optional, so you can use them only for search if you prefer. The app also includes Google Lens, which allows you to select anything on your PC's screen for image search or translation.

Despite Google's obsession with all things AI, the default search experience in the new app is the traditional results page. You can, however, switch it to AI Mode in the settings. If you're going to use Google's AI bot, this is a pretty good way to do it. The app doesn't take up much space and can float on top of other windows. It won't clutter up your browser tabs, either.
When you're done with the conversation (or search page), you can close the search bar with Alt+Space or Esc. You can also leave it floating on the screen, and the shortcut will move your cursor to the search bar. However, while the bar is resizable, the minimum size is still quite large.
The Google app for Windows is available for Windows 10 and Windows 11. You will need to opt in via Google's search labs before you can download it. Currently, the app is only available in the US and in the English language. Unfortunately, you do need to be logged in to use the Windows app.
