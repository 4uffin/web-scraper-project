What is "hard" anyway?

For seven years, the discussion around Hollow Knight: Silksong focused on the cult-like levels of devotion among fans patiently waiting for the sequel. Now that Silksong has been available for about a week, though, that discussion has turned decisively toward seemingly endless takes on the game's relative difficulty (or lack thereof). The discussion has gotten so loud that the developers at Team Cherry have vowed to implement a "slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter" in a coming patch.
So is Silksong too difficult for its own good? Or do players just have to "get good" and stop whining?
To help answer those questions, we felt it was a good time to bust out the Ars Difficulty Matrix (ADM™), which we first used to analyze Elden Ring's difficulty in 2022. By breaking down the various ways a game can be "difficult," the ADM™ can more precisely critique the ways Silksong is and is not designed to challenge players, both for good and for ill.
Each section of the ADM™ starts with a broad definition of the specific questions we're attempting to answer, followed by an analysis of how Silksong fits into that paradigm of the long history of video game difficulty.
Note: The remainder of this piece has very minor spoilers for some of the earlier portions of Silksong.
Mechanical difficulty
Does the game require players to hit a specific sequence of buttons in a certain tight timing window to succeed? Also sometimes referred to as a "reflex test."
Hollow Knight Silksong requires pretty good gaming reflexes. There's no way around it.
This is especially true when facing the game's many bosses, who often only briefly telegraph their intentions before unleashing attacks that can fill a huge portion of the screen. Players need to keep a careful eye on the sometimes small animation cues that presage an attack, move quickly and precisely to avoid that specific attack, and then dart back in during a quick counterattack window to do some damage before starting the cycle over again.
Unlike many Souls-like games, Silksong doesn't have a spammable dodge button that offers the player brief invulnerability to almost every attack, regardless of location. That means players must actually carefully plan and execute quick movements to a safe region of the screen, which can be exceedingly difficult in tight timing windows.

Bosses aside, Silksong's platforming often requires players to bounce off of aerial enemies or objects using a series of mid-air downward attacks. These precisely timed bounces are especially difficult early in the game, when the downward attack launches diagonally forward in an arc that can be challenging to aim precisely.
Later upgrades that allow you to float and/or dash in mid-air help reduce the challenge of these multi-bounce strings, as do optional upgrades that straighten out your downward slash. Even so, Silksong's platforming challenges will likely trip up a lot of players without extensive run-and-jump gaming experience.
Punishing difficulty
How much of a penalty does the game extract for mistakes? How many mistakes can you make before "dying"? And when you do die, how much progress do you lose?
On the plus side, Silksong never extracts the ultimate punishment by sending you all the way back to the start of the game. You have effectively infinite lives, and death never pushes back farther than your last save point.
On the downside, those save points are often spaced quite far apart, meaning death can require a good deal of backtracking through treacherous areas to get back to where you were (and to recover the crucial rosaries you collected in your previous life). This can be especially punishing when you reach a new region of the game and are forced to search for a convenient save point without the aid of a map, which makes retracing your steps all the more fraught and confounding.
It might be a while until you find the next resting place to save your game in Silksong.

The individual enemies in Silksong aren't very forgiving, either—just a few false moves can allow even random scrubs to get in enough damage to lead to a premature death. Bosses can do even more damage with a single attack and can also absorb a lot more damage than your poor avatar. Getting in five or 10 hits against a boss might be relatively simple, but getting in 50 or so before dying yourself often requires near-perfect levels of focus and execution across multiple challenging attack phases.
Like its predecessor, Silksong allows players to refill some of their health after gathering enough silk by hitting enemies. But even this nod to forgiveness is relatively punishing, since the health refill freezes your character in a defenseless pose for a few seconds. There's nothing quite so deflating as seeing an attempted health recharge get thwarted by an enemy lunging in for an inopportune attack.
Arcane difficulty
How well does the game explain its inner workings? Are there detailed tutorials explaining the basic controls and deeper strategies? Or do you have to figure it all out on your own? Are there signposts showing you what to do next?
The most difficult part of Silksong, for me, is often figuring out where I should be going. Before I find a map in a new region, I often find myself flummoxed trying to remember which paths I've already explored and which I still need to work through. And even with an in-game map in hand, it's difficult for me to remember which previously inaccessible corners might now be opened thanks to a new ability.

I'm willing to allow that this might be a personal problem with my sense of direction. Still, I'd imagine I'm not the only one who finds navigating Silksong's labyrinthine halls to be unexpectedly difficult.
The in-game map also purposefully obscures some of the game's secret nooks and crannies, which can only be found with careful observation (or a handy walkthrough). Many players could miss some of the game's most useful abilities if they're not observant. And while the game gives some basic tutorials for new abilities, a few mechanics seem intentionally obscured. I didn't know until hearing about the move in a YouTube video that you could dash downward to quickly reach the ground, for instance.
Grindable difficulty
Does the game give a patient player enough additional power, upgrades, tools, or knowledge to defeat difficult challenges? Or are you pretty much stuck with the techniques and abilities given to you at the outset?
For players willing to do a little optional exploring, Silksong can actually be pretty generous with the power upgrades. Hidden paths and missions can often lead directly to improvements for your health, weaponry, and move set that can pay huge dividends for later challenges in the game. And the required upgrades that you receive after certain bosses (see "Gated Difficulty," below) can often make earlier challenges in the game that much simpler if and when you backtrack a bit.

That said, there are limits to how much this additional power can help Silksong players. This isn't like some old-school RPGs where dozens of hours of grinding can lead to a Level 99 character that can take out the final boss in a single attack. Even with all the extra upgrades you can muster, you still have to struggle through the same basic dodge-and-counterattack repetition to get through some extremely difficult and unavoidable bosses.
Gated difficulty
Are large portions of the game hidden behind in-game challenges that need to be bested before you can move on? Or does the game offer alternative options for getting around what might be impassable progression walls?
Like any Metroidvania worth the genre name, large portions of Silksong require finding and unlocking new movement or attack capabilities. And in Silksong, those required abilities are usually gated behind major bosses that you'll need to take down before accessing massive chunks of the expansive in-game map.
If and when you do get stuck on one of these bosses, you're not necessarily trapped. You'll usually be able to backtrack a bit to explore a few optional side paths and missions, which can offer power boosts that can make the boss a bit easier (see "Grindable Difficulty" above). Speedrunners have also found some arcane sequence skips to get around certain bosses or methods for putting off some boss fights until later than the developers intended.

These will be of little use to many casual players, though, who may well give up on Silksong after banging their head against a progress-blocking boss for an hour or two.
Tunable difficulty
Does the game offer explicit options for players to change the difficulty level or make the game generally more accessible? If not, does the game tune its difficulty automatically based on a player's performance?
The lack of any difficulty-tuning options seems like a major omission for a modern title like Silksong. The game's options menu includes toggles for screen shake and HUD size, but nothing in the way of difficulty adjustments.

Here, the developers at Team Cherry would have done well to take a few lessons from Celeste. While the default Celeste experience requires extremely precise jumps and split-second reflexes, designer Maddy Thorson also felt it was important to offer an extremely forgiving "Assist Mode" for players who want or need a little boost.
“From my perspective as the game’s designer, Assist Mode breaks the game,” Celeste's Thorson said in an interview with Vice. "I spent many hours fine-tuning the difficulty of Celeste, so it’s easy for me to feel precious about my designs. But ultimately, we want to empower the player and give them a good experience, and sometimes that means letting go.”
A similar Assist Mode in Silksong would be easy for "serious" players to ignore while still allowing all players to at least have some access to the full breadth of Silksong's intriguing world. Even a Nintendo-style "invincibility" mode that appears after a couple-dozen failed boss encounters could give frustrated players an option to unstick themselves from the game's toughest sticking points.
ADM™ roundup
From a holistic point of view, Silksong is definitely on the tougher side of most dimensions on the Ars Difficulty Matrix™. The game requires good reflexes—especially for bosses and platform challenges—that can punish even small mistakes with relatively large penalties and hides large chunks of the game behind difficulty gates with no tuning options that might offer some relief. Plenty of players are going to be forced to give up long before they fight their way through some of the game's most difficult bits, and that's a shame.
But I think the passage of time has obscured just how much most of these critiques also applied to the original (and beloved) Hollow Knight. While Silksong's bosses might be a little tougher, and its jumping challenges a little more precise, its predecessor was also often unforgiving and gated in almost the exact same ways (though some of this difficulty was eventually rebalanced). Only 22 percent of Hollow Knight's Steam players have obtained the "Hollow Knight" achievement for reaching the first of the game's multiple endings, and I'm willing to bet most of the remainder gave up out of frustration rather than boredom [the original version of this story cited the incorrect Achievement. Ars regrets the error].
There's definitely room in the world of popular gaming for titles like Silksong that push even experienced players to their limits. But it's still a shame that this extreme level of challenge is going to prevent a large portion of the player base from ever directly experiencing everything Silksong has to offer.

I adored Hollowknight (Got the plushie, wall art, etc) - so going into Silksong, I was hyped.
I think they tuned the game a bit too heavy towards combat compared to the original (faster, harder hitting enemies and obstacles in the early game especially).
My favorite part of the genre is exploration; so not a huge fan myself.
One thing that isn't mentioned is the way health works in the game:
You start with 5 "hearts" (Ala Zelda, etc).
You heal in 3 heart chunks.
Many enemies (and hazards, like lava) do 2 hearts of damage in the very early game.
So, going into a fight… you have 5 hearts.
You take a hit.
You're down to 3/5.
You could heal, but you'd be wasting a third of the heal.
So you wait and take another hit - now you're at 1/5 and on deaths door.
Dangerous!
Worse, let's say you spend literal hours finding the pieces for another heart container.
Great, you're up to 6 hearts!
But wait, since everything is doing 2 hearts of damage, having 5 or 6 hearts doesn't matter - you still die in 3 hits. Whomp Whomp.
I know there are lots of folks who combat is their favorite part of the series; and this is all good stuff for them.
Frankly, the excessive runbacks (after you die) are even more obnoxious to me than the combat.
But for me, the wonder of exploration is what draws me in - and the combat isn't even my second favorite thing of the series.
Oh, and don't get me started on how so many bosses have no reward for killing them: No fancy new items or abilities, not even basic money…

Skimming this article as somebody with hardwired poor gross & fine motor skills (almost certainly related to being AuDHD, there is a definite correlation) kinda begs a question about accessibility in video games.
I don't play many video games in part due to the first family computer in the late 1980s being terrible for it and thus setting me on a different path, but also in very large part because I can never get good at games which require me to "hit a specific sequence of buttons in a certain tight timing window to succeed," no matter how much I practice, because my physiology simply can't reliably do it.
The only rare exception in twitch type gaming is some first-person shooters with a full keyboard & mouse, because the "button sequences" are more directly wired to movement (rather than an A-B-A-B-left-right type thing) and on a full keyboard which is more forgiving of fine errors, and because I can get good enough at mouse aiming to progress pretty well on some of these games at medium difficulty. But that's my ceiling. I'm hopeless on anything fast on a hand controller.
I also suck at every sport which requires coordination, always have and always will, and played hackeysack for hundreds of hours with my friends as a teen and never got better than comically bad.
So like ... should there be accommodations for people like me in games like this, since it's technically possible? Or (assuming I cared much about it, anyway) should I just always be left out and have to play a more limited selection?
Fortunately for me I like much less demanding (button-mashing-wise) MMOs, and walking simulator type games, and games like Sky and Journey and Flower from thatgamecompany. But it would be nice to be able to use a console controller for faster games and have a prayer of actually enjoying it.

It is okay for players to want hard games. It is okay for players to want easy games.
Stating that the game shouldn't have a more approachable difficulty is just gatekeeping and dumb.
Silksong is a phenomenal piece of art. It is a beautifully built world with so many wondrous ideas and characters. I want more people to be able to experience that. Whether they're older or disabled gamers who have more challenge with reaction times, parents who have less time to try-and-retry difficult challenges, or folks who just don't want to invest 3 hours into learning and conquering a tough boss. (Just to name a few examples)
I want gaming to be accessible, not a thing just for elitist college students.
As for difficulty: There are a host of mods available on Nexus Mods. You can make the game a bit easier to much easier. Here are some of my thoughts on mods I've seen/tried/considered.
Things that reduce friction
Always Compass: This is something you can usually deduce, but it takes time and it doesn't really benefit anything by needing that extra time-waste step.
Always Collect Rosaries: This trinket I think does change your play a bit. Rosaries are valuable, and forcing a player to spend a slot to have the magnet vs other benefits feels meaningful. It will get you certain rosaries you'd otherwise lose. I didn't run this one. I can also see this being a 'But its annoying, not fun' argument.
2x Shards: so you don't need to grind shards before returning to a boss grind. Enemies are definitely balanced around using tools to deal more damage, but the low maximum on shards punishes you for wanting to quickly get to Phase 2 of a boss and learn that phase.
2x Silk: Makes it easier to get resources to heal. You still need to find the moment to heal. Honestly one of the best improvements to the game I made. It lets you use offensive silk a bit more often which speeds up HP sponge mobs.
Enemies drop more rosaries: You can grind rosaries. That's just tedium. I didn't resort to this mod but I can see folks liking it.
Rosaries never lost: When you die, it adds rosaries to the cocoon, rather than loses them. If you don't cheese it, it makes the game more forgiving.
Enemy Healthbars: Useful for tracking your progress on bosses. Does minorly spoil when boss encounters are, but usually you can see when you're about to go into a locked room.
Death Counter: This is good for content creators. It's also good for casuals to recognize how many times they're dying. I started with few mods and slightly increased it as I need to go back to my other life things. I'd like to not spend more than 100 hours on Silksong. There's other life objectives I want to spend my time on.
Things that make the game meaningfully easier:
Deal double damage: This makes bosses less of a slog fest of doing tiny bits of damage. The downside is you can burst down certain enemies before they do anything.
No Double Damage: So many enemies do 2 masks of damage, or have chain attacks. Some mods just remove the double damage, others remove the 2-hit. I'm a fan of removing environment hazards that do 2 hits of damage.
Instant Cocoon Recover: I didn't try any of these mods.
Heal Over Time: I haven't tried this one, but every 15 seconds you heal a mask. If you take damage it goes dormant for like 20s. This takes some of the teeth out of attrition zones which I don't mind that much. Like I got to a location once, I can get there again, but not wasting 5 minutes for the privilege is fine by me.
Other Mods:
There are a host of 'Always on trinket' like the compass, magnetic rosaries, etc. Heal Shield was one.
Things that are funny:
No Double Damage: Makes things deal Triple instead. Good laugh.
Hope this helps folks who feel obstructed by Silksong's approachability.

Having slower reflexes in your 40's, 50's, and beyond isn't a character flaw, it's a fact of life. I'm definitely in favor of a world where a hypothetical 75-year-old-me can still enjoy the latest releases in series I love. Team Cherry is under zero obligation to make that a reality in their games. But wouldn't it be nice if they tried?
