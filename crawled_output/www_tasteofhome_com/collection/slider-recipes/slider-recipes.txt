Your party needs our slider recipes, because mini food is more fun!
ⓘ
You’re planning a party, and it’s time for the very best part: creating the menu. While you could order a big party sub or whip up potluck-ready sandwiches, we think these slider recipes should be the star of your spread. They’re bite-sized and warm, which most guests appreciate over cold sandwiches.
A common slider myth is that all sliders are burgers. Our best recipes can be made with a variety of proteins, like pulled pork, brisket, salmon and even eggs. The mini sandwiches are cute and filling—and they’re a fun, easy way to feed a crowd. While more elaborate entrees might require forks, knives and a place to sit, sliders can be eaten while standing. They’re the perfect finger food!
Best of all, sliders can be customized with any bread you like, from Hawaiian dinner rolls to pretzel buns. Once you choose a slider recipe and the perfect bun, you can move on to the rest of the menu. You can’t go wrong with a crudités platter or a few burger sides to pair with them.

The homemade sesame slaw calls for Sriracha sauce, so it definitely has a kick to it. If you prefer to skip the heat, simply omit the Sriracha from the sliders.Slider Recipes FAQWhy are my sliders soggy on the bottom?While saucy pulled pork and coleslaw are delicious sandwich ingredients, they contain moisture that can make tiny slider buns mushy. To prevent soggy sliders, assemble the dish right before the party to keep the sauce from soaking into the bread.You could also try soaking up some of the sauce with a paper towel before placing wetter toppings onto the buns. Additionally, try toasting the buns in advance to help them stay sturdy, or use chewy bread (like sourdough, ciabatta or pretzel rolls) instead of soft Hawaiian rolls.What side dishes go well with sliders?Most sliders are basically tiny sandwiches, so I love serving them with easy picnic sides. You could stay classic with french fries or potato chips, or think outside the box with sides like grilled corn in husks, caprese pasta salad or dill potato salad.How do you make burger sliders for a party?When I’m throwing a party, the last thing I want to worry about is cooking a million tiny burgers, so I always prep as many of the ingredients as I can ahead of time. I whip up the sauces, shred the lettuce, slice the tomatoes, and, yes, even cook the burgers in advance and reheat them right before the party. Store the ingredients separately and wait until right before your guests arrive to assemble the sliders.Another brilliant idea is to make one large, square burger (as we do in our cheeseburger sliders recipe). You can bake it in the oven and, when your guests arrive, cut it into smaller pieces to form individual burgers.
