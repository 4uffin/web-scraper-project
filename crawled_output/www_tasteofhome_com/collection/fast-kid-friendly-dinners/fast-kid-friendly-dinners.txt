My preschooler doesn’t eat ground beef unless it’s taco flavored, so I came up with this casserole we all like. To make assembly easy, I prepare the taco meat and freeze several bags at a time. —Kathy Wilson, Romeoville, Illinois

We love casseroles because of their dump-and-go ease. Cook your pasta, brown the beef, dump all the ingredients and watch them bubble to perfection in the oven. Love to meal prep? This taco casserole can be prepped ahead and reheated in the same pan. For maximum freshness, wait to sprinkle the crushed tortilla shells on top so they don’t get soggy sitting in the fridge.

Italian Submarine Recipe photo by Taste of Home
From the Recipe Creator:
My Italian husband grew up eating this flavorful sandwich, which his mother used to make it after Saturday chores were finished. Put the sub together a few hours ahead and refrigerate, then serve with chips, veggies and dip for a delicious meal. —Christine Lupella, Fifty Lakes, Minnesota

Sometimes, the best dinners are the most simple. Get the kids involved in assembling these sub sandwiches. They can choose their favorite ingredients to put in the sandwich to guarantee the perfect bite.

From the Recipe Creator:
This hearty dish is fast and easy to fix after a busy workday. We like to use hickory and bacon baked beans and serve it with fruit or a green salad for a complete meal. —Karen Roberts, Lawrence, Kansas
go to recipe
This easy dinner dish is packed with flavor and the kids will love munching on cheesy tortilla chips. The recipe makes 7 servings in only 15 minutes, so it’s perfect for a quick meal when you have to run out the door to the next activity. Of course, dinner wouldn’t be complete without some easy dessert ideas.
