From bubbling mac and cheese to glazed carrots, these slow-cooker side dishes have little prep but still deliver big flavor.
ⓘ
Money can’t buy time, unless you are talking about a slow cooker. More than just an appliance, it lets you focus on family while dinner gently cooks itself, so you aren’t missing out. Our slow-cooker side dishes are easy to prep and can be served right from the pot, so you can enjoy a comforting meal without being tied to the kitchen or creating a mountain of dishes.
This collection includes everything from hearty slow-cooker casseroles to lightly spiced and glazed vegetables. Plus, there are plenty of potato favorites, which are always a popular side. They pair beautifully with pork chops, roast chicken or grilled salmon, so no matter what you make, there is a side to match. Make these recipes your own by swapping in seasonal produce, adjusting the spice level or adding protein to transform them into a main course.
Perfect as make-ahead side dishes for a crowd or weeknight meals at home, these recipes store well, reheat without losing flavor and travel easily for potlucks. These slow-cooker recipes for sides take the stress out of mealtime and still deliver rich flavors.

Slow-Cooker Side Dishes FAQWhat easy slow-cooker side dishes will kids enjoy?Kids often love slow-cooker mac and cheese, creamy potatoes and vegetables with a touch of sweetness, like carrots and corn. A slow cooker makes vegetables velvety soft, for kids with wiggly teeth or those who struggle with hard textures.What are the best vegetables to cook in a slow cooker?Root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, turnips and butternut squash are ideal for a slow cooker since they hold their shape while becoming tender and don’t release much water when cooking. Delicate vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers and peas can also be prepared in a slow cooker, but they should be cooked for much less time than sturdy vegetables to prevent mushiness.Can you make mashed potatoes in a slow cooker?Making mashed potatoes in a slow cooker is easy, and they turn out fluffy and perfectly tender. Add chopped potatoes, broth or water and seasonings to the bowl of a slow cooker, cover and cook until tender. Then, mash with as much butter and milk as you like until smooth and creamy. Set the slow cooker to the warm setting until it’s time to eat for a hands-off way to prepare holiday side dishes in advance.
