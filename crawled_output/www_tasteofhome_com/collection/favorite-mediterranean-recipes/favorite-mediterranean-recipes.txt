From orzo salad and chickpea stew to baklava, these Mediterranean recipes cover easy dinners, shareable appetizers and fresh flavors for every mood.
ⓘ
Mediterranean recipes celebrate food at its freshest, relying on olive oil, herbs, grains and seasonal produce. From zesty lemon over crisp greens to grilled seafood with briny olive tapenade, these dishes show how easy Mediterranean dishes can be—simple to prepare yet full of flavor. Many of the same wholesome ingredients appear in healthy salads with a distinctly coastal flair.
The cuisine adapts beautifully to every occasion. A Greek salad piled with cucumbers, tomatoes and feta is a healthy Mediterranean meal that feels right at home on a weeknight, while creamy red pepper hummus with warm pita makes a natural centerpiece for gatherings. Honey-soaked baklava and nutty semolina cake bring a sweet finish, balancing the savory flavors of slow-simmered lamb with red wine and oregano. Even the dips bring their own twist—chocolate hummus that’s smooth and just sweet enough or a beet version that’s as colorful as it is nourishing. Each recipe reflects the essence of Mediterranean cooking: bold flavors, unfussy preparation and food meant to be shared. With its balance of proteins, legumes and greens, this cuisine fits seamlessly into everyday eating, much like these easy low-carb dinner ideas.
There’s no shortage of inspiring Mediterranean dinner ideas, from grain bowls to grilled fish with lemon and herbs. With vegetables, legumes and lean proteins at the center, these meals come together naturally as heart-healthy dinners that feel more like a getaway than a weeknight routine. When the flavors are this big, the cooking can stay simple; that’s the Mediterranean way.

Fill your house with the delicious aroma of spit-roasted gyros with this homemade version. Place the well-seasoned meat on warm pita bread; top it with tangy tzatziki, onions and tomato; and you'll have restaurant-quality Greek food straight from your kitchen. —Risa Lichtman, Portland, Oregon

Making a gyro at home is similar to making a meat loaf. You combine the ground lamb and beef in a food processor to create a sort of paste, which is then baked, weighed down and sliced. For the final step, sear the pieces to achieve a crispy outer layer like a rotisserie gyro. The melt-in-your-mouth meat can be used for salads and pitas.

We love toasted chickpeas, a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of sumac. There are plenty of ways to make hummus taste better.

Falafel is a common street food in the Middle East. They are gluten free, crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and full of flavor from cilantro, mint, coriander and nutty sesame seeds. Parsley can be added or used instead of mint. The classic version is deep-fried, but they can also be pan-fried, baked or cooked in an air fryer. Serve in or alongside pita bread with red onion, tomato, pickled cucumber and tahini sauce. —Nithya Narasimhan, Chennai, India

1 cookie: 172 calories, 9g fat (1g saturated fat), 0 cholesterol, 27mg sodium, 20g carbohydrate (7g sugars, 1g fiber), 2g protein.
go to recipe
Sinfully rich from olive oil and sweetened from a honey syrup bath, these must-bake Greek Christmas cookies are a welcome addition to any holiday fête. Although they call for a festive smidge of Cognac, you can make an alcohol-free treat by replacing the Cognac with orange juice.

From the Recipe Creator:
This tart, refreshing salad is a big hit in my home. All the tasty toppings—including red onions, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and a zesty dressing—give it extra interest. —Judy Roberts, Las Vegas, Nevada
Nutrition Facts:
3/4 cup: 167 calories, 6g fat (1g saturated fat), 4mg cholesterol, 427mg sodium, 24g carbohydrate (3g sugars, 2g fiber), 6g protein. Diabetic Exchanges: 1-1/2 starch, 1 fat.
go to recipe
Pasta salads are a forever favorite at summer gatherings and barbecues, and this Greek orzo salad ranks right up there with the best of them. Cooked orzo is tossed with tangy feta, crisp cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, briny olives and a zesty dressing, but the best part is that it gets even better as it sits in its marinating juices. While vegetarian as is, you could add marinated chicken skewers or gyro meatloaf to transform this side dish into an entrée for your whole family.

TASTE OF HOME
From the Recipe Creator:
While this rich, sweet Greek Easter bread, also known as tsoureki, is traditionally served during the spring, it can be served any time of year without the red eggs. Mahleb and mastic are customary, but they can be difficult to find and are often omitted. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen
Nutrition Facts:
1 piece: 203 calories, 7g fat (3g saturated fat), 89mg cholesterol, 113mg sodium, 27g carbohydrate (5g sugars, 1g fiber), 6g protein.
go to recipe
If you’re Greek, nothing says Easter quite like a loaf of tsoureki adorned with hard-boiled red eggs at the center of your dining table. While the process of making it is a little more involved than some of our other favorite Easter bread recipes, it yields a stunningly beautiful, symbolic and delicious loaf that’s well worth the effort.

My version of hummus features a delightful nuttiness from tahini, a peanut butter-like paste made from ground sesame seeds. The beans pack a lot of protein, so it's a healthy snack for kids. —Marina Castle Kelley, Canyon Country, California

go to recipe
Don’t have chickpeas on hand? Cannellini beans work just as well for hummus, given their buttery, creamy nature. You can always omit the crushed red pepper flakes for little eaters.

When comfort food cravings strike, a cheesy pasta bake loaded with chicken and all sorts of veggies satisfies.Mediterranean Recipes FAQWhat are traditional Mediterranean ingredients?Traditional Mediterranean ingredients include olive oil, garlic, ripe tomatoes, fresh herbs like oregano and basil, lemons and plenty of seasonal vegetables. Whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds round out the pantry. Tangy cheeses like feta, plain yogurt, olives, and lean proteins such as fish, chicken or lamb are staples across the region. They work together in the Mediterranean diet to build layers and satisfying flavors without relying on heavy sauces or processed foods. If you’re missing something, swap in a close alternative. Try sunflower seeds for pine nuts in pesto or barley for farro in a grain salad.Can I follow a healthy Mediterranean diet on a budget?Yes, it’s possible to enjoy healthy Mediterranean meals on a budget with some planning. Buy whole grains in bulk, choose affordable proteins like canned tuna or chicken thighs, and build meals around vegetables, legumes and grains. Batch-cook recipes like lentil stew or bulgur pilaf to stretch ingredients across the week. Frozen vegetables are another smart way to cut costs. They work well in soups, pasta tosses or roasted frozen vegetable recipes when fresh produce isn’t available.What are quick Mediterranean dinner ideas?Easy Mediterranean dinner ideas include Greek salad wraps, chickpea stir-fries and simple grilled fish recipes finished with lemon and herbs. Grain bowls with roasted vegetables, olives and a sprinkle of feta come together fast, especially if you prep a few components ahead of time. You can stock staples like hummus, canned beans and whole grain pita for easy, low-calorie Mediterranean diet dinners in minutes. Roasting a tray of vegetables on the weekend or cooking extra grains also makes it simple to get a head start for the week.
