These fall dessert bars combine seasonal flavors like pumpkin, maple and apple, with chewy, crunchy and fudgy textures for a taste of autumn in every bite.
ⓘ
Autumn is the bridge between the warm days of summer and the busy, chilly holidays, and these fall dessert bars welcome and celebrate the flavors of the changing seasons. Filled with pumpkin, maple, apple and cranberry, these comforting treats are easy to slice, simple to serve and fit for both weeknight cravings and festive gatherings.
As expected, pumpkin dessert recipes are prevalent throughout the collection, whether paired with chocolate, cream cheese or warm fall spices. But these easy fall dessert bar recipes also offer many other flavor options. Try buttery squares of apple-filled bars reminiscent of a classic apple pie, or easy treats full of crunchy nuts complemented by caramel, white chocolate or cinnamon.
Most recipes are made from scratch, perfect for a cozy afternoon baking project. If you are short on time, try a no-bake cereal treat bar or one that uses cake mix, so it takes minutes to assemble and get into the oven. Many of these recipes freeze well, so you can bake once and enjoy for months whenever you need something sweet.

Fall Dessert Bars FAQWhat are some quick fall dessert bar ideas?Some of the quickest fall dessert bars require minimal prep and little to no bake time, such as stovetop cereal treats or bars that start with shortcut ingredients, like cake mix. Adding maple extract, cinnamon, dried fruit or chopped nuts boosts the autumnal flavor of the desserts.Can I make fall dessert bars ahead of time?Fall dessert bars are excellent make-ahead treats that stay fresh for weeks or months if stored properly. Transfer cooled bars to airtight food storage containers, adding a piece of parchment between layers of sticky or delicate bars. Most bars can be stored at room temperature for two to three weeks. Dairy-based bars, like cheesecake, should be stored in the refrigerator for up to seven days.What are some gluten-free or vegan options for fall dessert bars?The best gluten-free or vegan options for fall dessert bars use pumpkin or applesauce instead of eggs, oil instead of butter and oats or a gluten-free flour mix instead of flour, like these gluten-free pumpkin bars. You can also adapt most recipes with vegan butter, dairy-free cream cheese or egg substitutes for baking, such as chia or flaxseed. Look for gluten-free cake mixes to use and check each product’s label, as some can also be vegan.
