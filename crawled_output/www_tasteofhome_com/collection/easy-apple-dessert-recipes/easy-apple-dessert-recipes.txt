Our best apple desserts bake fall's favorite fruit into glorious apple cakes, loaded breads and multi-layered bars that are a textural treat.
ⓘ
Shifting into autumn promises the return of our coveted fall desserts, and with the season’s prized fruit, apple desserts are the most anticipated. Their versatility is overwhelming, and toting home a bag of apples is giddying—what do you make?
We’ve rounded up our best apple desserts to help you decide. Want something classic? Our best apple pie, sugar-coated apple cider doughnuts and truly German apple strudel are textbook fall desserts. Looking for something a little more modern? That’ll be our caramel apple cheesecake, apple pear cake with cream cheese frosting or multi-layered apple crumb bars. How about something easy? Our apple cake, apple cobbler and apple crisp all have the word easy in their titles.
Our list includes all these recipes and so much more. As always, serve your apple dessert with vanilla ice cream, homemade whipped cream or salted caramel sauce. And if you’re an avid baker, I totally recommend playing around with other types of cinnamon, like Ceylon or Saigon, for more nuanced flavors.

Apple Desserts FAQWhat easy apple recipes can I make for dessert?Easy apple recipes for dessert include apple crisp, caramel apple dump cake, apple cobbler, apple cake and apple cookies. The hardest part of all these recipes is peeling, coring and cutting the apples. For an easy garnish, stick to store-bought ingredients like the best vanilla ice cream, canned whipped cream or a thawed tub of Cool Whip.What is the best dessert apple?The best dessert apples are Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, Braeburn, Cameo, Cortland, Crispin, Granny Smith and Jonagold. These are the best apples for apple pie and any other apple desserts! Always avoid mealy, bland apples like McIntosh or Red Delicious.What desserts and creative apple treats can I make to use up a lot of apples?Desserts and creative apple treats that use up a lot of apples include apple pies, candy apples, apple crumbles and apple bars. Usually, any dessert that has an apple filling will use around five or more apples. Homemade apple butter is another apple treat that uses a lot of apples. Our apple butter recipe calls for 5-1/2 pounds of apples, which is about 16 apples!
