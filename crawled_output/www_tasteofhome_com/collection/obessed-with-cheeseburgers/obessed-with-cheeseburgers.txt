Bacon Cheeseburger Pasta
I try to make foods that are not only kid friendly, but are also easy to reheat since my husband works long hours and often eats later than our children. If you like, use reduced-fat cheese and ground turkey for a lighter version. —Melissa Stevens, Elk River, Minnesota

Smash Burgers Recipe photo by Taste of Home
From the Recipe Creator:
Now is not the time to cut the calories or skimp on the salt. Go for ground chuck that is at least 80/20. If you can find a blend with ground brisket or short rib, all the better. The best burger comes with being liberal with the kosher salt—it's beef's best friend, trust me. — James Schend, Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin
Nutrition Facts:
