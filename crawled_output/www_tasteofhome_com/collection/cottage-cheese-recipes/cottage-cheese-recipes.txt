Cottage cheese is our favorite way to quickly add protein to any meal, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or even dessert! You and your family will love all our creative recipes using cottage cheese.
ⓘ
Just a few years ago, cottage cheese was one of those ingredients I (and so many others) hadn’t touched in about 20 years. But thanks to the internet, cottage cheese made a comeback. It all started with immersion-blending cottage cheese into eggs, then cooking them into super fluffy and high-protein scrambled eggs that everyone went crazy over. Now we’re adding this cheap, protein-rich ingredient to everything, from pancakes to lasagna and even ice cream.
Looking to incorporate cottage cheese into your diet? These recipes using cottage cheese will get you started. We have ideas for every meal of the day—including dessert! Easy cottage cheese dishes for breakfast include all kinds of pancake and breakfast casserole recipes, while lunch and dinner have an abundance of pasta bakes, sandwiches and enchiladas.
The sweet cottage cheese recipes might be the most exciting. Our cottage cheese cookie dough encourages you to eat cookie dough straight from the fridge, and our cottage cheese bananas Foster and cottage cheese ice cream are frozen treats packed with protein. Don’t forget our cottage cheese cheesecake, which is absurdly decadent and has 9 grams of protein per slice. We officially can’t get enough of cottage cheese!
