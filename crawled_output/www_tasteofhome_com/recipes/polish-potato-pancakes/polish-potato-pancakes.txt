Polish potato pancakes are a comfort food favorite. They're pan-fried until golden and crispy on the outside and soft and creamy in the center.
Made with simple ingredients, these Polish potato pancakes are pan-fried to golden perfection with crispy edges and tender, creamy centers. The secret to the standout texture? Finely grated potatoes and onion create a perfect balance of crunch and softness.
Like many of our best potato recipes, this Polish potato pancake recipe is pure comfort food. It’s also incredibly versatile. Serve potato pancakes dolloped with sour cream for a snack, topped with a hearty meat stew to soak up all the juices or alongside eggs for a savory breakfast. No matter how you enjoy Polish latkes potato pancakes, they’re downright delicious.
What’s the difference between Polish potato pancakes and latkes?
There’s not much difference between Polish potato pancakes and latkes, which makes sense since potato pancakes are a beloved dish across many European cuisines. Latkes are a traditional Hanukkah food, while Polish potato pancakes are enjoyed year-round as a snack, side dish or comfort food.
Both are made from grated potatoes and fried in oil until crispy.  One key distinction is the texture: Polish potato pancakes use finely grated potatoes, resulting in a creamier, more tender interior. Latke recipes typically call for coarser shreds that give a thicker, heartier bite. Latkes are also fried in more oil, making them extra-crispy.
Ingredients for Polish Potato Pancakes
Potatoes: Starchy potatoes like Russets work best for potato pancakes. The starch content is key to getting crispy edges and a fluffy, tender interior.
Onion: A yellow or sweet onion is your best bet here. Avoid the more pungent varieties, like white or red onions, which can overpower the flavor. Grate it finely so it blends smoothly with the potatoes.
Flour: A little all-purpose flour helps bind the grated potatoes and onion together. You can substitute a gluten-free flour blend if needed, but the texture might be slightly different.
Eggs: Eggs also act as a natural binder, helping the pancakes hold their shape during frying.
Oil: The best oils for frying are neutral in taste and have a high smoke point. Vegetable, canola, peanut or sunflower oil are all excellent choices for getting crispy, golden pancakes without burning the batter. You can use olive oil for extra flavor, but be careful not to overheat it since it has a lower smoke point.
Toppings: Potato pancakes are usually served with dollops of sour cream, and we like to add a sprinkle of minced chives for a baked potato vibe.  You can also go sweet with a spoonful of applesauce, fruit compote or jam.
Directions
Step 1: Prepare the potatoes and onion
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
Peel the potatoes and the onion. Using the fine side of a box grater (or a food processor with a fine shredding blade), grate both into a large mixing bowl. Drain the excess liquid.
Editor’s Tip: Extra moisture in the batter can leave you with soggy potato pancakes. For the crispiest texture, drain the mixture through a colander and press down, squeezing out as much liquid as possible, then return the veggies to the mixing bowl.
Step 2: Combine the ingredients
Add the flour, eggs, salt and pepper. Stir until everything is evenly combined and no streaks of flour remain.
Editor’s Tip: The potato pancake batter should be thick enough to hold together when scooped. If it feels too loose or wet, sprinkle in a little extra flour to bring it together.
Step 3: Pan-fry the potato pancakes
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
In a large skillet, heat 1/4 inch oil over medium heat. Drop the batter into the skillet by 1/4 cupfuls, pressing lightly with the back of a spoon or the bottom of the measuring cup to flatten it into a pancake shape. Fry the potato pancakes until they’re golden brown on both sides.
Editor’s Tip: For the crispiest edges, give each pancake plenty of breathing room in the skillet. You’ll likely need to fry in batches, so transfer the pancakes to a baking sheet in a 200°F oven to keep warm until serving.
Step 4: Garnish and serve
Serve the potato pancakes hot, garnished with dollops of sour cream and sprinkles of fresh chives, if desired.

Recipe Variations
Spice it up: Season the batter with paprika, garlic powder or cumin for earthy warmth, or add a sprinkle of cayenne for a bit of heat.
Add fresh herbs: Stir chopped dill, parsley or chives into the batter for a bright, fresh flavor that cuts through the richness of the potatoes and oil.
Include garlic: Squeeze one or two grated garlic cloves through a garlic press and stir it into the batter for extra savory, aromatic flavor.
Mix in other veggies: Replace one of the potatoes with grated zucchini or carrot—just be sure to squeeze out the extra moisture the same way.
Make sweet potato pancakes: Swap in finely grated sweet potatoes for a sweeter, more colorful version.
How to Store Polish Potato Pancakes
Polish latkes potato pancakes taste best when served hot and crispy from the skillet. If you happen to have leftovers, let them cool completely, then transfer them to an airtight container and store them in the refrigerator for up to three days.
Can you freeze Polish potato pancakes?
Polish potato pancakes are best fresh, but you can freeze them for up to three months. Let them cool, then spread them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for several hours until firm. Transfer them to a freezer-safe container or resealable bag.
How do you reheat potato pancakes?
To reheat potato pancakes, warm them in a 375° oven or air fryer for 5 to 10 minutes until crispy. If reheating from frozen, heat them for 10 to 15 minutes until warmed through. Avoid microwaving, which will make the Polish potato pancake recipe soggy.
Polish Potato Pancake Tips
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
What are the best potatoes for a Polish potato pancake recipe?
Starchy potatoes like Russets are ideal for potato pancakes. The higher starch content helps bind the batter, and they fry up crisp on the outside and tender inside. Yukon Golds will work, but your potato pancakes will be slightly softer and not quite as crispy.
Do you have to peel potatoes for Polish potato pancakes?
Most potato pancake recipes call for peeled potatoes, but no rule says you have to. Leaving the skins on will give your potato pancakes a rustic appearance and add a little extra fiber. If you skip peeling, be sure to scrub the potatoes well before grating.
Why aren’t my potato pancakes crispy?
There are a few reasons why your potato pancakes may not get crispy. Extra liquid from the potatoes and onion can make pancakes soggy, so squeeze out as much liquid as possible before mixing the batter.
If the frying oil is too cool, the pancakes will absorb the oil instead of crisping. Make sure to heat the oil until it’s shimmering, and test its temperature by dropping in a small spoonful of batter—it should sizzle right away. And don’t crowd the pan. Use a large skillet and leave space between the pancakes so the edges brown and turn extra-crispy.
What do you eat with Polish potato pancakes?
Polish potato pancakes can be served as a snack, appetizer or side dish. They’re perfect alongside hearty, comforting meals, like meaty goulash, roast chicken, or pork and sauerkraut. You can even serve them instead of hash browns with fluffy scrambled eggs and crispy bacon for breakfast. Don’t forget your favorite toppings—whether you like them sweet, savory or a little of both.
