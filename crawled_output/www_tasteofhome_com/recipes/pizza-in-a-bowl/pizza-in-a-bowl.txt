This skillet pizza pasta is your tasty new solution to the pizza vs. pasta night question.
Pizza pasta is a dinner experiment gone right. You get all the pizza awesomeness, like tomato sauce, pepperoni and melty mozzarella, but also with ground beef and rigatoni. It’s chewy, bouncy, saucy and a little indulgent—a layered pizza-pasta hybrid you can scoop or straight-up shovel. If you have strong opinions on pizza toppings (pineapple lovers, I’m looking at you), this dish is your playground. Think of it as a pizza night that doesn’t require plates, just bowls and big appetites. And I promise, it’s even better than delivery.
Pizza Pasta Ingredients
ALLISON CEBULLA FOR TASTE OF HOME
Rigatoni: This pasta shape is sturdy enough to hold all the beefy, cheesy sauce. It’s the perfect pick to catch pepperoni and melty mozzarella in every bite.
Ground beef: Browning ground beef before adding the sauce creates a topping similar to a classic meat lover’s pizza.
Onion: Chopped onion adds depth and sweetness as it cooks with the beef. It’s a simple way to bring balance to all that rich cheese.
Pizza sauce: A can of pizza sauce brings instant flavor without extra fuss. It’s already seasoned with herbs and garlic, saving you time in the kitchen. It’s a good option when you don’t have time for homemade pizza sauce.
Cream of mushroom soup: Condensed soup might sound unexpected in a pizza pasta recipe, but it adds creaminess and body to the sauce. It’s what makes this dish feel indulgent and a little casserole-like.
Mozzarella cheese: What’s pizza without cheese? Shredded mozzarella melts into gooey, stringy perfection, coating every noodle in cheesy goodness.
Pepperoni: Sliced pepperoni adds a smoky, salty, spicy flavor to every bite.
Fresh basil or arugula (optional): A sprinkle of fresh basil or a handful of peppery arugula at the end cuts through the richness of the sauce and cheese.
Directions
Step 1: Cook the pasta
Cook the rigatoni according to package directions and drain.
Editor’s Tip: Salting your pasta water is the best way to season the noodles from the inside out. It makes a big difference in flavor!
Step 2: Brown the beef and onion

Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook the beef and onion over medium heat for six to eight minutes or until the meat is no longer pink, breaking the beef into crumbles. Drain any excess fat.
Step 3: Stir in the sauce, soup and cheese

Add the pizza sauce, soup and cheese. Cook and stir over low heat until the cheese melts.
Step 4: Add the pasta and pepperoni

If desired, top with basil or arugula before serving.

Pizza Pasta Variations
Swap in different meats: Try Italian sausage, ground turkey or shredded rotisserie chicken instead of ground beef. Each brings its own personality to the dish.
Use other pasta shapes: Penne, shells or bow ties all work well and hold plenty of sauce.
Play with pizza toppings: Add sliced mushrooms, black olives, green peppers or jalapenos to make it taste like your favorite specialty pizza.
Try a meatless version: Skip the beef and pepperoni and load it up with extra veggies like zucchini, spinach or roasted red peppers.
Change the cheese blend: Use provolone, cheddar or other good melting cheeses for a new flavor profile.
How to Store Pizza Pasta
This pizza pasta recipe is just as good the next day, which makes it perfect for meal prep or leftovers. Once it’s cooled to room temperature, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
How long does pizza pasta last?
Pizza pasta will last for three to four days in the refrigerator. Just be sure to reheat it thoroughly before serving.
Can you freeze pizza pasta?
Yes, pizza pasta freezes beautifully. Store it in a freezer-safe container for up to two months. Thaw it overnight in the fridge before reheating.
How do you reheat pizza pasta?
You can reheat this pizza pasta recipe on the stovetop over low heat, adding a splash of water or sauce if needed. It also reheats well in the microwave, though stirring halfway through helps keep it evenly warm.
Pizza Pasta Tips
ALLISON CEBULLA FOR TASTE OF HOME
Can you bake pizza pasta?
Yes, you can absolutely bake pizza pasta. In fact, baking it in a casserole dish with an extra sprinkle of mozzarella on top gives you a bubbly, cheesy crust—almost like a pizza lasagna.
What else can you serve with pizza pasta?
This dish is rich and filling, so light and refreshing is the order of the day side-wise. Salad is always a good place to start, so check out a cucumber salad or a Parmesan arugula salad. Finish with some lemon ice and Prosecco for a truly Italian experience.
