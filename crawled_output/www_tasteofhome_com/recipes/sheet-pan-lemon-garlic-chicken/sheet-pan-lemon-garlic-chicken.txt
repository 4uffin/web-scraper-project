Lemon sheet-pan chicken features juicy chicken and tender potatoes drizzled with a zesty garlic-lemon marinade. Everything roasts together in one pan for an easy family-friendly meal with minimal cleanup.
Say goodbye to bland chicken dinners! This lemon sheet-pan chicken recipe is one of the easiest sheet-pan dinners you can make. Juicy chicken thighs, drumsticks and tender baby potatoes are coated in a zesty lemon, garlic and herb marinade. Everything bakes together in one pan, which means less mess in the kitchen—perfect for a busy weeknight or a casual weekend dinner. Wholesome, hearty and family-friendly, this is the kind of meal that feels special without much fuss.
Ingredients for Lemon Sheet-Pan Chicken
Olive oil: The lemon marinade begins with peppery olive oil, which helps coat the chicken and potatoes for maximum flavor in every bite. Any good quality olive oil works, but extra virgin olive oil will give you the brightest flavor.
Lemons: Fresh lemon juice gives the marinade its bright, tangy flavor. We also tuck fresh lemon slices alongside the chicken and potatoes for an extra-citrusy aroma and a pop of color.
Garlic: Minced garlic brings savory depth and aroma to help balance the lemon’s acidity. Fresh garlic is best, but you can swap in 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder in a pinch.
Herbs: Thyme and rosemary infuse an earthy, aromatic flavor into the chicken and potatoes as they roast. Finish the dish with a sprinkle of parsley for extra freshness and color.
Chicken: Bone-in dark meat thighs and drumsticks roast up juicy and full of rich, meaty flavor. Boneless skinless cuts work too, but you’ll need to reduce the cooking time so they don’t overcook and dry out.
Potatoes: Creamy, tender baby red potatoes soak up the lemon-herb marinade and roast to crispy, golden perfection.  If baby reds aren’t available, try Yukon Golds or fingerling potatoes.
Directions
Step 1: Marinate the chicken
Preheat the oven to 425°F. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper. Pour 1/4 cup of the marinade into a large bowl or shallow dish, then add the chicken and turn to coat each piece. Cover and refrigerate the bowl of chicken and the bowl of remaining marinade for 30 minutes.
Editor’s Tip: Marinate the chicken in a zip-top bag for easy cleanup.
Step 2: Prepare the sheet pan
Drain the chicken and discard any marinade left in the bowl. Arrange the chicken on a greased rimmed 15×10-inch sheet pan. Scatter the halved potatoes around the chicken in a single layer. Drizzle the reserved marinade over the potatoes, and top with lemon slices.
Step 3: Bake
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken reads 170° to 175°. If you want the chicken to have a crispy, golden exterior, switch the oven to broil and cook for three to four more minutes, keeping a close eye on it to prevent burning. Sprinkle with fresh parsley, then serve.
Editor’s Tip: Garnish each serving with lemon zest before serving for even more citrus flavor.

Lemon Sheet-Pan Chicken Variations
Add more veggies: Toss carrots, zucchini, onion, asparagus or Brussels sprouts onto the sheet pan for extra color and flavor. Cut the veggies into pieces similar in size to the potatoes so everything roasts evenly.
Try another protein: This recipe also works with chicken breasts or salmon fillets. If using salmon, roast the potatoes for 25 to 30 minutes first, then add the salmon to the pan and bake for about 10 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork.
Switch up the herbs: Try fresh or dried oregano, basil or dill in place of thyme and rosemary, or reach for Italian seasoning as a seasoning shortcut.
Make it spicy: Add red pepper flakes or a pinch of cayenne to the marinade for a kick.
Serve it Mediterranean-style: After baking, top the chicken and potatoes with kalamata olives, marinated artichoke hearts, chopped tomatoes or crumbled feta.
How to Store Lemon Sheet-Pan Chicken
Let the chicken and potatoes cool slightly, then transfer them to an airtight container. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to four days.
How do you reheat sheet-pan lemon chicken?
For the best texture, reheat leftovers in a 350° oven until the chicken and potatoes are warmed through. If you’re in a hurry, the microwave works, but the potatoes won’t be as crisp. After reheating, garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices to brighten everything back up.
Lemon Sheet-Pan Chicken Tips
TASTE OF HOME
Can I use boneless chicken instead of bone-in?
Yes! You can make this sheet-pan lemon chicken dish with boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, but they cook faster than bone-in cuts. Start checking the internal temperature after 25 to 30 minutes in the oven. The chicken is finished cooking when it reaches 170° to 175°.
Can you make sheet-pan lemon chicken with other types of potatoes?
Absolutely! Most types of potatoes, except russets, will work well in this sheet-pan lemon garlic chicken recipe. If you don’t have baby red potatoes, Yukon Golds, fingerlings or even sweet potatoes are all great choices. Cut them into 1-inch chunks so they cook evenly alongside the chicken.
What else can you serve with sheet-pan lemon chicken?
This sheet-pan lemon garlic chicken recipe already includes potatoes, so all you need is a simple vegetable side to complete the meal. Try a simple green salad, steamed asparagus or broccoli, garlicky green beans and mushrooms, or a scoop of sauteed spinach for a healthy and fresh meal.
