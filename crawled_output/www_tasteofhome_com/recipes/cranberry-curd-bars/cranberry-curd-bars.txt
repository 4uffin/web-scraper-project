A festive fall twist on classic lemon bars, these cranberry curd bars feature a homemade cranberry filling that delivers vibrant color and bright, seasonal flavor.
Cranberries don’t always get as much love as apples or pumpkins when it comes to fall baking, but these beautiful berries aren’t just for Thanksgiving. Colorful, cozy cranberry desserts are a wonderful way to enjoy this seasonal fruit all autumn long. Plus, their signature tart flavor makes for a refreshing palate cleanser after any hearty meal—yes, even a turkey feast.
Cranberry curd bars are a festive spin on classic lemon bars. They start with a simple, three-ingredient buttery shortbread crust topped with a creamy, homemade cranberry curd. Making the curd is surprisingly easy and similar to making cranberry sauce. Once baked and chilled, the bars slice beautifully and bring a cheerful pop of color to dessert trays, bake sales and holiday tables.
Ingredients for Cranberry Curd Bars
All-purpose flour: Everyday all-purpose flour forms the base of the shortbread crust. Be careful not to overfill your measuring cup, otherwise the crust may end up with a dry or crumbly texture. The best way to measure flour is to spoon it into the cup, then level it with a straight edge, like a knife.
Confectioner’s sugar: The fine, powdery texture easily dissolves into the shortbread dough to create a soft, tender crust. It also gives the bars a pretty finish when it’s dusted over the top after baking and chilling.
Butter: Softened butter gives the crust its rich, buttery shortbread flavor, while melted butter makes the cranberry curd smooth and silky. Use unsalted butter to control the amount of salt in the recipe.
Cranberries: The seasonal star of this recipe, cranberries give the filling a vibrant ruby hue and sweet-tart flavor. Fresh or frozen cranberries both work well here.
Granulated sugar: Use regular white sugar to sweeten the cranberry curd and balance the tartness of the berries. It also helps thicken the cranberry mixture as it cooks.
Orange juice and zest: Technically, this is a cranberry-orange dessert. We use juice and zest in the cranberry curd to add a bright, citrusy note and more complex flavor. Use freshly squeezed juice and zest the orange before cutting it.
Egg yolks: Yolks, not whole eggs, thicken the curd, give it a glossy texture and help it set in the oven. Separate the eggs, then let the yolks sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes for smoother mixing.
Directions
Step 1: Make the dough
Allison Cebulla for Taste of Home
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, letting the ends extend up the sides (this will make it easier to lift the bars out later).
In a bowl, combine the flour, butter and confectioners’ sugar.
Step 2: Bake the crust
Allison Cebulla for Taste of Home
Pat the combined ingredients into the prepared pan. Bake the crust until it’s golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.
Step 3: Make the filling
Allison Cebulla for Taste of Home
Meanhwhile, to make the cranberry curd, add the cranberries, sugar and orange juice to a large saucepan. Cook them over medium heat until the cranberries burst, about 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Let the mixture slightly cool.

Transfer it to a blender and puree until smooth.

Send the mixture through a fine mesh sieve, and discard the solids.

Stir in the orange zest, butter and egg yolks until the curd mixture is smooth.
Step 4: Bake the curd
Allison Cebulla for Taste of Home
Pour the cranberry curd evenly over the crust. Bake the bars until the curd is set and top appears dull, 15 to 20 minutes. Let the pan cool to room temperature on a wire rack.
Step 5: Chill and finish
Refrigerate until the bars are fully chilled, about one hour. Sprinkle them with confectioners sugar, if desired, before serving them.

Recipe Variations
Coconut cranberry curd bars: Add shredded coconut to the dough for a tropical flavor twist. Toast extra shredded coconut to sprinkle on top after baking and cooling the bars.
Swap the  citrus: Swap lemon or lime for the orange juice and zest to make the filling tangier and punchier.
Add nuts: Mix finely chopped almonds, pecans, walnuts or pistachios into the shortbread dough for a bit of crunch and a nutty flavor.
Try an herbal infusion: Add a sprig of fresh rosemary or thyme while cooking the cranberries to infuse the curd with earthy, aromatic flavor. Just be sure to remove it before blending the cranberry mixture.
Amp up the flavor: Add vanilla extract to the dough for floral warmth, or try almond extract for a subtle, nutty sweetness that pairs beautifully with the tart cranberries.
How to Store Cranberry Curd Bars
Once the bars have cooled and chilled, transfer them to an airtight container with parchment or waxed paper between layers to prevent sticking. Since the cranberry curd contains eggs, the bars need to be refrigerated. They’ll stay fresh for up to four days, but the confectioners’ sugar garnish may dissolve over time.
Can you freeze cranberry curd bars?
Yes, just like lemon bars, cranberry curd bars will freeze beautifully. After chilling and slicing the bars, place them on a parchment-lined tray or baking sheet and freeze them until they’re firm. Wrap each bar tightly in storage wrap and transfer them to a freezer-safe container or resealable bag. Keep them frozen for up to three months. Thaw the bars in the fridge overnight and finish them with a fresh dusting of confectioners’ sugar before serving.
Cranberry Curd Bars Tips
Allison Cebulla for Taste of Home
Can I use frozen cranberries instead of fresh?
Absolutely, frozen cranberries work just as well for making the cranberry curd. Add them frozen (no thawing required) to the saucepan and increase the cooking time by a few minutes.
Can I double this recipe for cranberry curd bars?
Yes, you can double the ingredients and bake the bars in a 13×9-inch pan, similar to our Meyer lemon bar recipe. You may need to increase the baking time to between 20 to 25 minutes for the curd layer to set.
Why didn’t my cranberry curd set?
If your cranberry curd still looks jiggly in the center, it probably needs a few more minutes in the oven. Bake until the center is set and the top looks dull and slightly matte, not shiny. Don’t skip the chilling step—refrigerating helps the filling firm up so it doesn’t ooze when you slice the bars.
What’s the best way to cut cranberry curd bars?
The best way to cut the cranberry curd bars into neat squares is with a sharp chef’s knife. Use the parchment paper overhang to lift the entire slab from the baking dish and place it on a cutting board for easier slicing. Cut the bars into a three-by-three grid to get nine equally sized squares. For clean edges, run the knife under hot water and wipe it dry between slices.
