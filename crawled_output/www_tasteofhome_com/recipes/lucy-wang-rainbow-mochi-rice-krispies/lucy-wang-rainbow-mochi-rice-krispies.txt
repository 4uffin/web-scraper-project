Rainbow mochi Rice Krispies is an Asian-inspired twist on a classic treat. Mochi is made of rice flour, so this whole sheet is gluten-free! —Lucy Wang, Los Angeles, California

Text Ingredients
Directions
In a large bowl, mix together cereals; set aside.
In a large saucepan, cook the butter over medium heat until golden brown, 5-7 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add the marshmallows and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Working quickly, add the cereal. Once combined, add the mochi and stir until well distributed.
Spread the mixture onto a greased baking sheet, pressing lightly to shape it. Top with sprinkles, pressing to adhere as needed. Let cool completely. Once cool, cut into bars.
