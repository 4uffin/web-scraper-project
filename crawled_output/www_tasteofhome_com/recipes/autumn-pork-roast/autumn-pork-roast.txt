8 medium potatoes, peeled and quartered
8 carrots, halved lengthwise
2 medium onions, quartered
1 small pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1-1/2-inch chunks

Text Ingredients
Directions
Place roast in a large baking pan. Arrange potatoes, carrots, onions and pumpkin around roast. Add water to the pan. Sprinkle meat and vegetables with sage, salt and pepper; dot vegetables with butter.
Bake, uncovered, at 400° for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°; bake, uncovered, for 1 hour. Place the apples around roast; cover and bake until a thermometer inserted in pork reads 145°, 45-60 minutes, basting every 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. If desired, thicken pan juices for gravy.
