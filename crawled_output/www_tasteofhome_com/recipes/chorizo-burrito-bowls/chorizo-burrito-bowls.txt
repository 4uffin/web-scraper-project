This chorizo bowl is the kind of fast weeknight dinner that actually tastes like a treat.
Browned sausage, earthy beans and blistered corn kernels jostle for space in this satisfying chorizo bowl. The heat from the pan pulls sweetness from the onions and coaxes the tomatoes and green chiles into a bubbling sauce. Then comes the spinach, just before the whole thing is crowned with crumbled queso fresco and a confetti of fragrant, fresh cilantro. If you don’t lean over the skillet at least once and breathe deeply, you’re missing the point.
You could call this a burrito bowl, but it’s better than that. This is a weekday triumph that looks like leftovers but eats like a reward. You get the richness of sausage without things getting greasy, and the satisfaction of a one-pan dinner you wouldn’t trade for a bowl of takeout.
Chorizo Bowl Ingredients
Canola oil
Chorizo or jalapeno chicken sausage
Onion
Black beans
Diced tomatoes and green chiles
Corn
Brown rice
Baby spinach
Queso fresco or Monterey Jack cheese
Cilantro
Directions
Step 1: Brown the sausage
In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the sausage, then cook and stir it until it’s lightly browned. Remove it from the pan.
Step 2: Add the vegetables and simmer
Add the onion to the same skillet, then cook and stir for three to five minutes or until it’s tender. Stir in the beans, tomatoes, corn and sausage, and bring the pan to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, for five minutes.
Step 3: Add the rice and spinach
Stir in the rice and spinach, and cook for two to three minutes or until everything has heated through and the spinach is wilted. Sprinkle bowls with the cheese and cilantro before serving.

How to Store a Chorizo Bowl
Let the chorizo bowl cool completely, then transfer it to a food storage container and refrigerate. It will keep well for up to four days and reheats nicely in the microwave or a skillet. For the best results, store the cheese and cilantro separately and add them just before serving.
Chorizo Bowl Tips
Eric Kleinberg for Taste of Home
Can you use cilantro lime rice instead of brown rice in this chorizo bowl?
Yes, you can swap cilantro lime rice for the brown rice in this chorizo bowl to add a fresh, zesty flavor. It pairs especially well with the chorizo and black beans, and adds extra flair to each bite.
What are some good add-ins to bulk up this chorizo burrito bowl?
To add bulk to this chorizo bowl recipe, try tossing in roasted sweet potatoes or sauteed bell peppers, or put a fried egg on top. These ingredients bring more color, flavor and texture to the bowl while keeping the prep simple.
What can you serve with chorizo bowls?
For a full meal, serve this chorizo bowl with a side of tortilla chips and guacamole or a simple green salad. A fruit salad or mango salsa would also complement the smoky, savory flavors nicely.

I'm always on the hunt for fast and filling meals. Chicken sausage makes an awesome one-dish dinner by itself or served with brown rice in a burrito. —Elisabeth Larsen, Pleasant Grove, Utah
