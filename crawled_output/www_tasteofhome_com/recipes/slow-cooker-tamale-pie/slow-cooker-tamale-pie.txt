Slow-cooker tamale pie is a flavorful, stick-to-your-ribs meal. Since it's easy to prepare, this recipe is great for potlucks or family dinners.
Slow-cooker tamale pie has the same flavors and textures of a traditional tamale, but is so much easier to make. Cooked slowly on the low setting, this dish is best assembled about seven to eight hours before you plan on eating it.
Authentic Mexican recipes are known for their fresh, savory flavors, their beautiful array of chiles and of course, their frequent use of corn. This recipe takes those attributes and packs them into a more Americanized casserole.
Ingredients for Slow-Cooker Tamale Pie
Ground beef: Most often, ground beef is made from chuck, a cut located near the neck and shoulders.
Cumin: Native to both Egypt and the Mediterranean region, cumin has become a popular spice worldwide, and is very common in Mexican cuisine.
Chili powder: Feel free to choose the variety of chili powder that fits your tastes. For example, ancho or chipotle chili powder are both popular.
Pepper: Peppercorns are actually the small fruits of the pepper plant. Mild in heat, pepper is mainly added for flavor.
Black beans: Due to their earthy flavor and creamy texture, black beans combine wonderfully with ground beef.
Tomatoes: We recommend using canned tomatoes for this recipe. Since the tomatoes will be cooked for a few hours, fresh tomatoes won’t have a chance to shine.
Green chiles: Canned green chiles are usually made with Hatch or Anaheim chiles, which are mild in heat. Feel free to dice fresh ones or use an equivalent amount of fresh poblano peppers.
Corn: As one of the iconic ingredients of Mexican cuisine, using whole corn kernels adds both color and flavor.
Enchilada sauce: While Mexican food uses both green and red enchilada sauce, the latter works better in this slow-cooker tamale pie recipe.
Green onion: We like the mild sweetness of green onion, but most types of onions work well in this recipe.
Cilantro: This herb gives a fresh flavor to this otherwise very savory dish.
Cornbread mix: Traditional tamale dough is made with corn flour and pork lard, but this process can take some time. Using cornbread mix creates a similar effect, but in a fraction of the time.
Eggs: The eggs in this recipe help the cornbread mix form a dough.
Mexican cheese blend: This blend of cheeses usually includes both American and Mexican cheeses.
Sour cream (optional): If you want to try a traditional Mexican ingredient that’s similar to sour cream, crema or nata are both good options.
Directions
Step 1: Cook the ground beef
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
In a large skillet, cook the beef over medium heat until it’s no longer pink. Drain any excess liquid, then stir in the cumin, salt, chili powder and pepper.
Step 2: Slow-cook the tamale filling
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
Transfer the seasoned beef to a 4-quart slow cooker. Stir in the black beans, tomatoes, corn, enchilada sauce, onions and cilantro. Cover the slow cooker and cook the tamale filling on low for six to eight hours or until it’s heated through.
Step 3: Add the cornbread topping
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
In a small or medium bowl, combine the cornbread mix and eggs. Spoon the mixture over top of the tamale pie filling. Cover and cook the tamale pie for one hour longer or until a toothpick inserted into the cornbread comes out clean.
Step 4: Top with cheese and serve
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
Uncover the slow-cooker and sprinkle this slow-cooker tamale pie with cheese. Cover the pot and let the cheese melt for five minutes. Serve the tamale pie with sour cream and cilantro, if desired.

Slow-Cooker Tamale Pie Variations
Substitute the ground beef: This recipe can be made with chicken, pork, ground turkey or almost any meat you desire. If you choose a white meat, you may enjoy this recipe with pinto beans instead of black beans, or salsa verde instead of tomatoes and enchilada sauce.
Make it vegetarian or vegan: Instead of ground beef, use a meat substitute, like soy chorizo, or simply make this slow-cooker tamale pie with extra beans. To make it vegan, use an egg substitute with the cornbread mix and nutritional yeast instead of cheese.
How to Store Slow-Cooker Tamale Pie
Once this dish has cooled, transfer any leftovers to an airtight container and store them in the fridge for up to four days. To extend the tamale pie’s freshness as long as possible, make sure you place the slow-cooker tamale pie toward the back of the fridge. While this tip may seem obvious, it’s one of the most common food storage mistakes that home cooks make.
Can I freeze slow-cooker tamale pie?
This recipe freezes well, so it’s a great one to make ahead of time and keep for those moments when all you want to do is reheat and eat. First, allow your leftovers to cool, then transfer them to a freezer-safe container. You can then store them in the freezer for up to three months. Thaw the tamale pie in the fridge overnight before enjoying it.
Slow-Cooker Tamale Pie Tips
ERIC KLEINBERG FOR TASTE OF HOME
What are tamales made of?
Traditionally, tamales are made of soft corn dough stuffed with an assortment of ingredients. Next, they’re steamed in a corn husk (or sometimes banana leaves). Making tamales from scratch can take all day, so this slow-cooker tamale pie gives you a similar flavor, without the need to commit as much time and effort.
What can I add to cornbread to make it taste better?
If you’d like to make your cornbread more flavorful, we suggest working some cumin and chili powder straight into the dough. You can also add some of the whole corn kernels or incorporate the cheese right into the dough.
Can you put raw beef into the slow-cooker?
Technically, ground beef can cook in the slow-cooker without a problem. That said, if you do this you’ll end up with a lot of excess liquid and grease, which can turn your slow-cooker tamale pie into a mess. Browning the meat first will add more flavor.
