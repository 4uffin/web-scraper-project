'Tis the season for homemade pumpkin spice lattes and copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread baked right in your own kitchen.
It’s no surprise that Starbucks bakes a great pumpkin loaf. From their beloved lemon loaf to the iconic cheese Danish, Starbucks has its pastry case down pat. But in the midst of fall, the pumpkin loaf reigns supreme: Tender, fall-spiced and abundantly pumpkin-y, it’s almost worth the $4.75 for a 1-inch-thick slice. Almost. That’s why our Test Kitchen pros decided to crack the code on the recipe, creating a copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread that can be made right at home as a much more economical option.
Our recipe uses an entire can of pumpkin between two loaves, so it’s full of great pumpkin flavor, plus a perfected spice blend that helps it taste just like the pumpkin loaf at Starbucks. Before they hit the oven, the loaves are sprinkled with pumpkin seeds, mimicking the shop’s iconic pumpkin bread from the inside out.
To make it feel as if you’re buying the pumpkin bread right from Starbucks, cut the loaves into 1-inch-thick slices and pair a slice with a copycat Starbucks pumpkin spice latte.
Ingredients for Copycat Starbucks Pumpkin Bread
Canned pumpkin: Not all canned pumpkins are created equal. In fact, some brands are better than others. Our Test Kitchen pros taste-tested eight different brands to find the best canned pumpkin.
Eggs: Bring the four eggs to room temperature so they blend better into the batter. Four eggs seem like a lot, but they add structure and volume to the bread.
Canola oil: Since canola oil is liquid at room temperature, it helps maintain moisture in the pumpkin loaves. Butter, even melted butter, will resolidify at room temperature, making the loaves a little drier.
Sugar: Granulated sugar sweetens the pumpkin loaves. Feel free to use light brown sugar in its place.
Honey: Honey’s nuanced flavor goes beyond simple sweetness, creating lightly floral, earthy flavors in the pumpkin loaves.
All-purpose flour: For the lightest pumpkin loaves, measure the flour properly (so you’re not accidentally adding too much flour) and then sift it so it blends into the batter easily. The less mixing, the lighter the loaves.
Baking soda: Baking soda makes the pumpkin loaves rise.
Spices: We’ve perfected the spice blend used in the pumpkin loaf at Starbucks: It’s a specific mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.
Pumpkin seeds: Also called pepitas, pumpkin seeds bake on top of the Starbucks pumpkin bread recipe. You can find them among the nuts and seeds at the grocery store.
Directions
Step 1: Mix the batter
Josh Rink for Taste of Home
Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to beat the pumpkin, eggs, canola oil, water, sugar, honey and vanilla extract until well blended.

In another large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.

Gradually beat the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture just until combined.
Step 2: Portion into loaf pans
Josh Rink for Taste of Home
Evenly divide the batter between two greased 9×5-inch loaf pans.

Sprinkle the tops with the pumpkin seeds.
Step 3: Bake
Bake the pumpkin loaves until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Let the loaves cool in their pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and onto a wire rack to cool at room temperature.

Recipe Variations
Make it gluten-free: Whenever I need to make baked goods gluten-free, I use King Arthur Flour’s Measure for Measure gluten-free flour. In my experience, it’s one of the best gluten-free flour blends available.
Add mix-ins: Numerous mix-ins work well with pumpkin bread. We recommend adding chocolate chips, nuts or dried fruit.
Top with streusel: If you love texture in desserts, add unbaked streusel to the batter in the loaf pans just before baking.
How to Store Copycat Starbucks Pumpkin Bread
To store copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread (and keep it ultra moist), allow it to cool completely to room temperature, then wrap it tightly in storage wrap and seal it in an airtight container. It can be kept at room temperature for up to two days or in the fridge for one week.
Can you freeze copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread?
Yes, you can freeze copycat Starbucks pumpkin bread, and it freezes beautifully! Once the loaves have cooled to room temperature, wrap them tightly in storage wrap, followed by a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze them for up to two months, then thaw on the counter.
Copycat Starbucks Pumpkin Bread Tips
Josh Rink for Taste of Home
Why did my pumpkin bread sink in the middle?
If the pumpkin bread sinks in the middle, that probably means either you let the batter stand for too long before baking or the bread is underdone. Here’s how to fix undercooked bread if you’re stuck with a sinking middle.
Can you bake the batter into muffins?
Yes, you can bake the batter into muffins. Divide the batter evenly between 24 greased, regular-sized muffin cups, then bake them at 400° until a toothpick inserted into the center of a few in the middle rows comes out clean, 15 to 22 minutes.
Can you use homemade pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin?
You can use homemade pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, but we don’t recommend it. Homemade pumpkin puree is often a bit more watery than canned pumpkin, which can negatively alter the texture of your baked loaves.
