A dirty chai espresso martini is where cozy fall flavor meets speakeasy glamour.
A dirty chai espresso martini tastes like sweater weather in a glass. For those of us who can never say no to an espresso martini, this version is a dreamy, autumnal upgrade. Chai lovers will already know that a dirty chai latte just is a chai latte with a shot of espresso or two. In this case, we flipped the script by making an espresso martini and adding chai. To do this, you’ll simmer chai tea bags with sugar and water to create a chai simple syrup that’s chock-full of cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and black-pepper flavors. It only takes a few minutes, and you’ll even end up with leftovers you can use to sweeten your tea or morning latte the next morning.
Shake it all up and you’ve got yourself cocktail magic: a drink that balances cozy fall vibes with undeniable going-out energy.
Ingredients for a Dirty Chai Espresso Martini
Chai tea: Chai tea has a long history, beginning in India almost 5,000 years ago. This singular blend of warm spices is known across the world as a luxury, yet you can pick up great chai tea right at your local grocery store. I used the Tazo brand for my simple syrup.
Sugar and water: The foundational elements of simple syrup are just granulated white sugar and water (filtered water if you’re feeling fancy).
Espresso or cold brew concentrate: Dirty chai isn’t dirty without that strong, bitter coffee flavor to balance all the spices. Pick up a couple shots from your local coffee house when you’re getting your morning brew, pull shots from your espresso machine or a handy dandy Nespresso machine. The real shortcut is to buy or make cold brew concentrate, which packs a punch of flavor and is already cool—it just won’t be as frothy as brewed espresso.
Vodka: A clean, neutral base spirit lets the coffee and spice flavors shine. Use your favorite brand of vodka.
Kahlua: This coffee liqueur adds a touch of sweetness and extra depth. Don’t skip this one; it really supports both the coffee and tea flavors—even if it seems like overkill.
Garnishes: Coffee beans float on top for that classic espresso martini garnish, while star anise leans into the chai spice theme and indicates that this isn’t your run-of-the-mill espresso martini.
Directions
Step 1: Make the chai simple syrup
Sarah Tramonte for Taste of Home
Add the sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium-high heat and bring them to a boil. Cook the mixture until the sugar is dissolved, four to five minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat, add the tea bags and simmer them until they’re fragrant, about five minutes. Remove the syrup from the heat and discard the tea bags. Let the syrup cool completely before using it.
Editor’s Tip: Leave the tea bags in the syrup as it cools for more chai flavor. This makes enough syrup for many martinis, but is also great in your morning coffee or even drizzled over pancakes.
Step 2: Build the martini

Chill a martini glass or coupe. Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice. Add the chai syrup, coffee liqueur, vodka and cold brew or espresso.
Step 3: Shake it up
Place the lid on the shaker. Shake it hard for about 20 seconds, or until the shaker is icy cold and the drink inside is frothy.
Step 4: Strain and serve

Strain the cocktail into your chilled martini glass or coupe.
Step 5: Garnish and enjoy
Float a few coffee beans or a star anise pod on top. Then sip it immediately while the foam is fresh.

Dirty Chai Espresso Martini Variations
Spice it up even more: Use spiced rum instead of vodka to lean even harder into those warm chai flavors.
Adjust your amounts: If you prefer a stronger dirty chai flavor or a lighter drink, reduce the vodka to 1 ounce or 3/4 ounce.
Serve on the rocks: A tall iced dirty chai martini tastes great over ice, especially if your espresso didn’t have quite enough time to cool. Add a little milk too, if you want (we won’t tell anyone).
How to Store Dirty Chai Syrup
Chai simple syrup should be stored in an airtight jar or container in the refrigerator. It will keep for up to two weeks and is handy for adding to coffee, tea or cocktails on a whim.
Can you make chai espresso martinis ahead of time?
You can batch the espresso, vodka, Kahlua and chai syrup in a pitcher ahead of time and keep it chilled. When it’s party time, shake individual servings with ice to get that signature frothy top.
Dirty Chai Espresso Martini Tips
Sarah Tramonte for Taste of Home
Can you use Bailey’s Irish Cream in a dirty chai espresso?
You can absolutely use Baileys Irish Cream in a dirty chai espresso martini, but shaking it directly into the drink changes the vibe, making the cocktail sweeter, creamier and less frothy. If you love a bold, coffee-forward martini with that classic foamy top, the better move is to keep the Baileys in a topping of flavored whipped cream instead. That way, you still get all the cozy chai spices and espresso punch in the cocktail, plus a fluffy, boozy topping you can swirl in, sip by sip.
To make the whipped cream, start with a chilled bowl and whisk (or a hand mixer if you want to save your biceps). Pour in one cup of cold heavy cream and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of Baileys Irish Cream. Whip it until soft peaks form (think pillowy clouds that hold their shape but still look smooth). Taste the whipped cream and adjust: Add confectioners’ sugar if you want it sweeter, or another splash of Baileys for more of a kick. Dollop it on top of your dirty chai espresso martini for a cozy cocktail-meets-dessert moment.
What other flavored cold foams could you put on top of a dirty chai espresso martini?
Pumpkin cold foam would be absolutely delicious on top of an already autumnal dirty chai martini. A cookie butter cold foam or a brown sugar cold foam would be great garnishes as well. Feel free to get creative: Anything that would taste great with chai spices and coffee would make a great flavor for cold foam!
