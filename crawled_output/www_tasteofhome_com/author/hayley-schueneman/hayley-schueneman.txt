Experience
Hayley Schueneman (she/her) is an editor and writer for Taste of Home. She's loved all things food for as long as she can remember. Hayley has worked in media, marketing, food service and as a supervisor at Whole Foods, where a customer once threw a bag of quinoa at her head. (Don't worry, she still loves quinoa.) Her areas of expertise include vegan and vegetarian recipes, budget-friendly recipes and hacking fast-food menus. Her cooking mantra is that everything tastes better with the right sauce.
When she isn't reporting on the latest food news and trends for Taste of Home, Hayley is probably crushing bar trivia or cooking at home. She lives in the Chicago suburbs with her 70-pound rescue dog, Tilly.
Education
Knox College, bachelor's in international relations and French
