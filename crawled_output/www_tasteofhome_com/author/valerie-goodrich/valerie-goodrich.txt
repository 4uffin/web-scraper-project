Experience
Val has 12 years' experience writing about and cooking food. With degrees in Baking & Pastry Arts and Applied Food Studies from The Culinary Institute of America in tow, Val excitedly shares her knowledge about all things food and recipes with Taste of Home readers. She especially loves to get into the science behind different baking techniques and why certain ingredients are better than others for baking (looking at you, Kerrygold butter!).
Outside Taste of Home, Val is always planning her next all-about-food trip abroad, dusting off a vintage cookbook or watching "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" for the millionth time.
Education
