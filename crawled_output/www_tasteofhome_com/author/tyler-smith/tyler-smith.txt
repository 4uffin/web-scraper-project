Tyler Smith’s Barbecue Smash Tacos Turn yesterday’s backyard barbecue into something totally new! We’re transforming leftovers into barbecue smashed tacos using smoky grilled flavors you already love. By crisping up the meat for that irresistible crunch and topping it with a zesty, spicy coleslaw, you'll create a fresh, flavorful twist on a classic taco. It’s the perfect way to repurpose good eats into an easy, exciting weeknight meal. —Tyler Smith, Virginia Beach, Virginia
Tyler Smith’s French Onion Sliders These French onion cheeseburger sliders are the ultimate bite-sized indulgence. Juicy beef patties are topped with caramelized onions and melted cheese, all tucked into soft slider buns for a savory, melty twist on a classic. Perfect for game day parties or anytime you’re craving big flavor in a small package. —Tyler Smith, Virginia Beach, Virginia
