Experience
Kate is a writer and hospitality aficionado who is always on the lookout for the next best bite (or sip.) Whether behind the bar or at her keyboard, Kate loves sharing unique stories about food, cocktails, wines and spirits, and the people who make them. She believes strongly that community is created when people come together over a great meal, and the more we all eat together, the more we might understand each other.
Baking cakes and breads since she was a kid, Kate’s style in the kitchen is notoriously messy and experimental but delicious. Influenced by the chefs she has worked with across the country, including Chad Colby, Steve Samson, Paul Kahan and Nancy Silverton, Kate favors cooking Italian dishes and pasta for her friends. When she’s not hosting dinner parties or writing, you will find her walking around the north side of Chicago trying to wear out her cattle dog/bully mix, Mason.
