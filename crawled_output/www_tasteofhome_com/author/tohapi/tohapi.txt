Articles & Recipes
Crunchy Cheesy Crisps I found a recipe in one of my cookbooks, which I've had for quite some time, and tweaked it to make these cracker-like crisps. They go well with any dip or spread. —Dawn Lowenstein, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania
Spicy Cantaloupe Bites Juicy melon, tangy sauce and assorted peppers come together to create a sweet and spicy tidbit. Combine these peppered melon balls with plain melon for a refreshing salad. —Aysha Schurman, Ammon, Idaho
Pimiento Thumbprint Shortbreads with Jam A twist on the classic jam-filled shortbreads, these savory and sweet treats are packed with flavor. Try mixing things up by using tomato bacon jam or raspberry jam instead of hot pepper jelly. —Courtnee Williams, Luray, Tennessee
