Blind Mice These easy, decadent and chocolatey mice-shaped truffles are perfect for Halloween (or Christmas!). They're a cute addition to your holiday charcuterie boards. —CJ Hathway, San Francisco, California
Halloween Salad This sweet and savory Halloween salad combines the best of fall produce. With pumpkin, spinach and cranberries, it looks just as good as it tastes, with a maple and pumpkin dressing tying it all together. —Joan Hallford, North Richland Hills, Texas
Jalapeno Mummies I like to take appetizers to my daughter's home before we trick-or-treat with the grandkids. They all love jalapeño poppers, so these easy and cheesy bites were perfect for the occasion. —Lori Stefanishion, Drumheller, Alberta
