No, his favorite food is not moonbeam ice cream.
Benson Boone is everywhere. You might know him as the guy who did a flip off of a piano at this year’s Grammy Awards. Even if you didn’t catch the Grammys, I absolutely guarantee that you know at least one of his songs, “Beautiful Things.” It won 2025 Song of The Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards and has been the song in one out of every three TikToks or Instagram Reels you’ve seen over the last year.
When he isn’t releasing new music or filming new videos, he’s probably refueling with one of his favorite foods. Since he calls out moonbeam ice cream in another one of his songs, “Mystical Magical,” I had to assume that ice cream would be at the top of his list. But to my surprise, he actually prefers a savory dish—and what’s more, it’s one of his mom’s recipes. Aww, Benson!
What is Benson Boone’s favorite food?
Benson Boone loves his mom’s lasagna! He’s mentioned it in a few different interviews over the years. While tasting a pavlova for a Kiwi Snacks review on YouTube, he mentions that the fluffy white dessert is nearly perfect. The caveat? “I mean, nothing can be perfect,” he says. “Except maybe my mom’s lasagna.”
I am in the same camp as Benson Boone and Garfield the Cat: I think lasagna is incredible. My mom actually makes a protein-packed plant-based version with tofu and spinach in place of ricotta cheese, and it’s such a genius swap that I always forget that it’s vegan. And Julianne Moore is also famous for having a really great vegetable lasagna. Her recipe, which included asparagus and zucchini, was even included in a charity cookbook.
Aside from his mom’s lasagna, Benson Boone’s other favorite food is probably cereal. He considers himself a bit of a breakfast cereal enthusiast, with his favorite being Lucky Charms. They’re mystically magically delicious!
