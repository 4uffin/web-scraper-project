Protect your pans and don't make these mistakes.
Sometimes, you need a pan that works both on the stovetop and in the oven. For example, when searing a steak on the stovetop before cooking it through in the oven, or sauteeing vegetables for a frittata then letting the eggs gently set in the oven. But can stainless steel go in the oven? It’s one of the most popular cookware materials thanks to its durability, even heating and cleanability. It turns out you can add versatility to that list, since most stainless steel is oven-safe.
Can stainless steel go in the oven?
Broadly speaking, yes: Many pieces of stainless steel cookware can go in the oven. High-quality stainless steel is almost always oven-safe. Look for cookware labeled as “cladded” stainless steel, which is made by layering different metals to make a stronger, more durable pan. Steel labeled as 18/10, 304 or 430 are also good quality options.
The best way to tell if a stainless steel piece can go in the oven is to consult the manufacturer’s specifications when you purchase it. If that’s not possible—maybe you found a great deal at Goodwill—check the bottom of the pan, which is often marked with information about the material, or even with labels like “oven-safe.”
Is all stainless steel oven-safe?
There are several kinds of stainless steel that should not go into the oven. Thinner, lower-quality stainless steel isn’t strong enough to stand up to high heat heat, and can discolor or warp. Stainless steel pots and pans with aluminum bases aren’t a good choice, either. And you should never put a piece with a wooden or plastic handle into the oven.
So far, we’ve mostly focused on stainless steel cookware. Stainless steel tools—ladles, spoons, spatulas, etc.—are not likely to be oven-safe. Ditto for stainless steel bowls or accessories. They’re simply not designed with heat in mind.
