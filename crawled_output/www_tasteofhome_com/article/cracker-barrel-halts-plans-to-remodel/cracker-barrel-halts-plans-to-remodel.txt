The Southern-themed restaurant will keep its current logo and discontinue plans for an interior redesign.
If you’re a foodie like me, there’s no doubt you’ve heard about Cracker Barrel and its talks of remodeling the restaurant interiors and refreshing the logo. Overall sales were not where the chain wanted them to be, and a revamp could potentially expand its customer base. However, due to heavy customer criticism, Cracker Barrel decided to halt any further rebranding. Isn’t it a little funny how restaurants had suggestion boxes that were probably never opened, and now everyone on the internet has their opinions? We can’t say it’s not effective, though.
Cracker Barrel Will Remain the Same After All
Cracker Barrel was hoping to upgrade the interiors of its restaurants for a modernized look. On August 19, Cracker Barrel also presented a new logo. It was an updated version of the current logo with a sleeker font and without the recognizable “old timer” figure. However, longtime customers of the Southern-themed restaurant steadily voiced their opinions.
Due to the massive amount of customer criticisms and comments, Cracker Barrel decided to put a pause on its current remodel strategy and reverted back to the classic logo just a week later. The chain also issued a statement about the pause.
While some were upset about the remodel itself, many others voiced concern about the food. If you know anything about Cracker Barrel, it’s that it sure knows how to serve up a tasty Southern breakfast. However, customers were hoping to see as much passion put into the food as was going into the remodel. Quite a few comments were about the quality of the food, saying the comfort dishes felt more like diner food as of late. If the chain’s next focus is on the menu itself, I just hope the spiced apple butter doesn’t change!
