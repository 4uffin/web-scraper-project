For anyone in their sourdough "Lover" era.
Taylor Swift is releasing her twelfth studio album on October 3. It’s called The Life of a Showgirl, but considering how much Taylor Swift loves baking, it could also be called The Rise of a Doughgirl. Listen, Taylor likes puns so I bet she would loaf that one too!
When Taylor Swift appeared on her fiance Travis Kelce’s podcast, New Heights, and mentioned how she’s obsessed with baking bread, it wasn’t exactly news. Real fans know that baking has always been a part of Taylor’s hobby DNA. It’s how we got her homemade pop tart recipe, as well as her viral chai cookies. And apparently, she’s a big fan of sourdough bread.
On the podcast, though, Taylor mentioned making a Funfetti sourdough for Jason Kelce’s daughters, “because they love everything rainbow.” Many fans sprang into action to figure out how to make this on their own, but Pillsbury took it one step further and made Funfetti Sourdough Bread Mix.
When is the Funfetti Sourdough Bread Mix available?
VIA FUNFETTI.COM
Apparently, Pillsbury is taking a page out of Taylor Swift’s song book, because the rollout of this bread mix feels a lot like an album drop. There are only 1,500 boxes available, so cue those Eras Tour Ticketmaster flashbacks. On Wednesday, Sept. 24, starting at 12:00 p.m. EST, you’ll be able to preorder a box on the Funfetti website. The bread mix will cost $9.99 and includes free shipping. The box should arrive just in time for The Life of a Showgirl’s release on October 3.
If you are one of the lucky 1,500 fans to score a box, then you’ll be able to celebrate the new album in style! My only hope is that Funfetti sent some boxes to Taylor so she can surprise Jason Kelce’s kids with a perfect rainbow-sprinkle loaf.
