There’s one piece of furniture I’ll always remember: my parents’ kitchen table. Growing up, this was our family hub. It’s where we shared spaghetti dinners, rolled out Christmas cookies and prepped Thanksgiving stuffing. It’s where I spent countless hours doing homework or thumbing through my mom’s magazines. It’s the spot where many conversations started—and lasted until the wee hours of the morning. That table has been a gathering spot for loved ones all throughout my life.
So, when my husband and I needed to find a table for our kitchen, I took the task seriously. As you’ll learn in my LoveSac Sactional review, I’m a big proponent of “forever furniture.” I want pieces that will carry us through every stage of life. But in a world of flat-pack, budget-friendly options, those heirloom-worthy pieces can be tricky to find. Especially on the internet!
When I came across an Instagram ad for Castlery, I was intrigued. The brand claims to produce high-quality furniture in mid-century and contemporary styles, with reasonable prices to boot. Thinking this viral find was too good to be true, I tested the Castlery Seb dining table set so I could evaluate the craftsmanship in my own kitchen.

What is Castlery?
Founded in 2013, Castlery is an online-only furniture brand selling goods for every room of your house. You can find sofas, tables, chairs, beds, storage, patio furniture and accessories. The furniture is made in China and Southeast Asia.
The Seb dining table set I chose is just one part of a larger collection. You can find a Seb bed, desk, TV stand, dresser, console—you name it. These large collections are perfect for anyone who loves a matchy-matchy look. But there are plenty of cohesive pieces if you prefer to mix it up. Most everything on the Castlery site has a classic look that would suit many interior design styles, from farmhouse to Scandinavian.
Castlery Seb Dining Table Set Features
When researching the best kitchen and dining tables, one of the things that drew me to Castlery was the ability to customize furniture to your needs. We have a pretty small kitchen nook to fit seating, and thanks to baseboard radiators, a built-in banquette was out of the question.
The Seb is sold in individual pieces and as a set. For the latter, you can choose between two table lengths, three bench options, two or four chairs and wood or fabric chair finishes. There are also extendable table options.
The pieces are made from solid Acacia wood and include a 1-year warranty.
How We Tested It
I received the Seb dining table set in May 2024. I chose the 59-inch table with two wood chairs and a 51.2-inch bench.
Delivery and Assembly
KATIE BANDURSKI FOR TASTE OF HOME
I opted for standard service delivery, which allows for drop-off in the first dry area of your home. I received a text to schedule my delivery window. Then, on delivery day, two kind workers brought three large cardboard boxes into my entryway. Each box was fairly heavy and bulky, so I needed help from my husband to move them into the kitchen.
Luckily, assembly was a breeze. The first box I opened contained two chairs; all I had to do was lift them out and remove any packing materials. Next, I tackled the bench, which required screwing in the legs. The table was similar—just at a larger scale. All I had to do was attach the legs, and voila! The assembly was complete. I did need a hand to lift the table right-side up, but everything else was manageable by myself.
First Impressions
KATIE BANDURSKI FOR TASTE OF HOME
I could tell during delivery and assembly that this set was going to be sturdy. Each piece was heavily weighted—a stark contrast to the MDF flat-pack furniture I’m used to assembling.
More importantly, the set looked exactly like the listing photo. Everything from the cozy wood tone to the rustic, distressed finish matched my expectations. We have a lot of different wood tones throughout our kitchen. Specifically, the retro cabinets. And the table’s muted, honey tone was a classic complement. Plus, if we ever decide to update the kitchen in the future, I’m confident this set will still look timeless.
Additional Uses
KATIE BANDURSKI FOR TASTE OF HOME (2)
Since it was delivered, my family has eaten several meals a week at our new kitchen table. While we’ve only had a max of four people around it, you could comfortably fit up to six.
We try to use placemats, trivets and coasters as much as possible, but there have been a few slip-ups. I’ve noticed some very slight water rings, but the table’s surface is surprisingly forgiving. For the sake of testing, I purposefully spilled some wine on the table. If you wipe it up immediately, there are no issues. However, the online listing makes it clear that this is a table surface that needs a little TLC, so, this may not be the most practical option if you’re cleaning up substantial messes on a daily basis.
The chairs and bench are incredibly sturdy. I’ve used them both to stand on when I need a little extra height, and they support my weight with ease. The padded fabric bench is definitely more comfortable than the plain wood chairs—especially if you’ve been sitting for a long time.
Beyond dining, this set has been useful for a bounty of tasks. We’ve used it to hold food for a family potluck, unpack groceries and sort mail. Since my kitchen is short on counter space, I’m excited to have a designated space for rolling out holiday cutout cookies and pie crusts.
Cleaning and Care
This set has required very little maintenance since its inaugural assembly. I wipe crumbs up after we eat, but that’s about it.
Castlery recommends using a slightly damp cloth to clean and avoid harsh chemicals. They also suggest avoiding direct heat or sunlight to prevent fading. My kitchen is very sunny, but so far, I have had no issues.
I will say that this table is not as forgiving as materials like laminate or glass. So, if you have young kids or messy eaters who require substantial clean-up after a meal, the wood will likely show signs of wear.
15-Month Update
Katie Bandurski for Taste of Home
After more than a year of daily use, the Seb dining set still looks as good as new. I’m careful to use placemats, coasters and hot pads, but there have definitely been some forgetful moments—and the table’s wood surface hasn’t deteriorated one bit. The sun also hasn’t made an impact, even though the table gets at least six hours of direct sunlight exposure a day. The bench, chair and table legs are still very sturdy, but I have had to tighten the legs on the bench and chairs occasionally.
The Seb set has replaced our formal dining room as the go-to eating area, and it’s a cozy spot to entertain a few guests. When my sister is in town, her golden retriever, Luna, loves to curl up beneath the table, too.
My only complaint thus far is the chair’s comfort. I wish I had opted for fabric chairs because, frankly, they’re pretty hard to sit on for hours on end. I’ve looked into cushions, but I’ve yet to find a pair that matches the size and my color preferences.
Pros
Incredibly sturdy, heirloom-quality construction
Modest price point
Easy assembly
Customizable set with a variety of sizes and seating options
Part of a larger furniture collection
Timeless style
Cons
Wood surface may not be suitable for families with little kids
Chairs are a bit uncomfortable for long periods
What Other Reviewers Had to Say
I’m not the only one who gives 5-star Castlery reviews. Over 190 reviewers love their Seb set.
“I recently purchased [the] Seb dining table, and I must say, it has exceeded all my expectations,” says Igor B. “The craftsmanship is evident in every inch. This dining table feels substantial and built to last, instilling a sense of confidence in its durability.”
If you’re short on space, this table has uses beyond dining, too. “It’s a great size and very sturdy. Very well made and easy to put together,” says Allison B. “I’m actually using it as a desk because it holds my three monitors, my laptop, a desk lamp and all the notebooks I need to do my job.”
Product Comparison: Seb vs. Other Castlery Dining Sets
VIA MERCHANT (4)
We tested the Seb Dining Table Set, but Castlery offers a few other stylish dining sets that cater to different spaces and tastes. Here’s a quick breakdown of how they compare.
Seb Dining Table Set: Seats 4–6 with 4 chairs and a bench, making it great for flexible seating and casual dining. Its minimalist design and warm wood tones suit most interiors, and the bench can tuck under the table to save space. Best for families or small gatherings who want versatility and a modern look.
Vincent Dining Set: Similar in size to the Seb, but includes 4 chairs only (no bench). It has a more traditional aesthetic with clean, classic lines and a timeless finish. Best for those who prefer a more formal dining setup with uniform seating.
Brighton Oval Dining Table with Carrie Chairs: A compact oval table paired with 4 upholstered Carrie chairs, ideal for intimate meals. The elegant shape and soft chair curves bring a slightly dressier vibe. Best for smaller dining areas or anyone looking for a cozy, stylish feel.
Theo Dining Table with Joshua Chairs: A round table with 4 sleek chairs, perfect for casual meals and conversation. The compact size and modern style make it a smart choice for apartments or kitchens. Best for: small spaces and open layouts where flow and flexibility matter.
Bottom Line: Choose the Seb if you want bench seating and space-saving flexibility. The Vincent is more classic, Brighton adds elegance with its oval shape, and Theo is ideal for tighter spaces with a modern touch.
Final Verdict
I consider Castlery to be the Goldilocks of online furniture. It’s not too cheap nor too expensive; the designs are contemporary yet classic, offering a timeless feel; the construction is sturdy, allowing solid materials like 100% acacia wood to sing. The Seb dining table set, in particular, is a solid option that I expect to last for many stages of life.
