What is the Lenox Spice Village Christmas collection?
The 2025 Lenox Spice Village Christmas collection brings all the retro charm of the iconic Spice Village—first released in 1989—into the holiday season. We’re smitten with the hand-painted porcelain and cozy dollhouse vibes that remind us of Christmas at grandmas.
In addition to the Spice Village’s iconic pastel hues, you’ll also find festive light-up details and rich red, green and gold accents. It’s a nod to Lenox’s roots, reimagined with a little holiday magic.

Lenox Spice Village Christmas Train Server
Shop at Lenox
My personal favorite from the Lenox Spice Village Christmas collection? This charming train server decked out in holly, poinsettias and trimmed with 24-karat gold. The four-piece set includes an engine with a lid, a train car with a lid and two open cabooses—perfect for loading up with cookies, candy or whatever keeps your holiday spirit on track.

Lenox Spice Village Christmas Lit Church Figurine
Shop at Lenox
This light-up church figurine is adorned with wreaths, bows and glowing candlelit windows that feel straight out of a vintage Christmas postcard. We’re obsessed with the powder blue roof (so dreamy!). It would look beyond adorable nestled next to your Spice Village setup.

Lenox Spice Village Christmas Lit House Figurine
Shop at Lenox
This little lit house is giving major Victorian Christmas vibes. We love the petal pink roof—a major nod to the pastel hues in the signature Spice Village—which adds the perfect pop of color and pairs beautifully with the powder blue on the church. It’s the kind of duo that deserves a front-and-center spot in your holiday village display.

2025 Lenox Spice Village Ornament
Shop at Lenox
Want to bring that iconic Lenox Spice Village charm to your Christmas tree? The 2025 Spice Village ornament has you covered. This tiny treasure features a snowy blue roof, stained-glass-style windows, classic red and green accents, and a gold hanging cord. It’s the perfect gift for any ornament collector—or let’s be real, a must-have for your own tree.
Where to Buy
You can shop the new Lenox Spice Village Christmas pieces, along with plenty more holiday items, directly on the Lenox website. The pieces we’ve highlighted range from $41 to $130, so there’s something for every budget (and every corner of your holiday display).
And if you need a holiday gift for the Lenox lover in your life, don’t sleep on other Spice Village gear like cozy patterned pajamas or the darling canister set.
