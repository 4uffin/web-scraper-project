LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by 💤 lazy.nvim
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.
Rather than having to choose between starting from scratch or using a
pre-made distro, LazyVim offers the best of both worlds - the flexibility
to tweak your config as needed, along with the convenience of a pre-configured setup.
✨ Features
🔥 Transform your Neovim into a full-fledged IDE
💤 Easily customize and extend your config with lazy.nvim
🚀 Blazingly fast
🧹 Sane default settings for options, autocmds, and keymaps
📦 Comes with a wealth of plugins pre-configured and ready to use
⚡️ Requirements
Neovim >= 0.11.2 (needs to be built with LuaJIT)
Git >= 2.19.0 (for partial clones support)
a Nerd Font (optional)
a C compiler for nvim-treesitter. See here
🚀 Getting Started
You can find a starter template for LazyVim here
Try it with Docker
docker run -w /root -it --rm alpine:edge sh -uelic '
apk add git lazygit fzf curl neovim ripgrep alpine-sdk --update
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim
nvim
'
Install the LazyVim Starter
Make a backup of your current Neovim files:
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
Clone the starter
git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
Remove the .git folder, so you can add it to your own repo later
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
Start Neovim!
nvim
Refer to the comments in the files on how to customize LazyVim.
There's a great video created by @elijahmanor with a walkthrough to get started.
@dusty-phillips wrote a comprehensive book called
LazyVim for Ambitious Developers
available for free online.
📂 File Structure
The files under config will be automatically loaded at the appropriate time,
so you don't need to require those files manually.
LazyVim comes with a set of default config files that will be loaded
before your own. See here
You can add your custom plugin specs under lua/plugins/. All files there
will be automatically loaded by lazy.nvim
