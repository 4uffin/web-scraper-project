Overview
Perplexica is an open-source AI-powered searching tool or an AI-powered search engine that goes deep into the internet to find answers. Inspired by Perplexity AI, it's an open-source option that not just searches the web but understands your questions. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms like similarity searching and embeddings to refine results and provides clear answers with sources cited.
Using SearxNG to stay current and fully open source, Perplexica ensures you always get the most up-to-date information without compromising your privacy.
Want to know more about its architecture and how it works? You can read it here.

Features
Local LLMs: You can utilize local LLMs such as Qwen, DeepSeek, Llama, and Mistral.
Two Main Modes:
Copilot Mode: (In development) Boosts search by generating different queries to find more relevant internet sources. Like normal search instead of just using the context by SearxNG, it visits the top matches and tries to find relevant sources to the user's query directly from the page.
Normal Mode: Processes your query and performs a web search.
Focus Modes: Special modes to better answer specific types of questions. Perplexica currently has 6 focus modes:
All Mode: Searches the entire web to find the best results.
Writing Assistant Mode: Helpful for writing tasks that do not require searching the web.
Academic Search Mode: Finds articles and papers, ideal for academic research.
YouTube Search Mode: Finds YouTube videos based on the search query.
Wolfram Alpha Search Mode: Answers queries that need calculations or data analysis using Wolfram Alpha.
Reddit Search Mode: Searches Reddit for discussions and opinions related to the query.
Current Information: Some search tools might give you outdated info because they use data from crawling bots and convert them into embeddings and store them in a index. Unlike them, Perplexica uses SearxNG, a metasearch engine to get the results and rerank and get the most relevant source out of it, ensuring you always get the latest information without the overhead of daily data updates.
API: Integrate Perplexica into your existing applications and make use of its capibilities.
It has many more features like image and video search. Some of the planned features are mentioned in upcoming features.
Installation
There are mainly 2 ways of installing Perplexica - With Docker, Without Docker. Using Docker is highly recommended.
Getting Started with Docker (Recommended)
Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
Clone the Perplexica repository:
git clone https://github.com/ItzCrazyKns/Perplexica.git
After cloning, navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Rename the sample.config.toml file to config.toml. For Docker setups, you need only fill in the following fields:
OPENAI: Your OpenAI API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use OpenAI's models.
CUSTOM_OPENAI: Your OpenAI-API-compliant local server URL, model name, and API key. You should run your local server with host set to 0.0.0.0, take note of which port number it is running on, and then use that port number to set API_URL = http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER. You must specify the model name, such as MODEL_NAME = "unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_XL". Finally, set API_KEY to the appropriate value. If you have not defined an API key, just put anything you want in-between the quotation marks: API_KEY = "whatever-you-want-but-not-blank" You only need to configure these settings if you want to use a local OpenAI-compliant server, such as Llama.cpp's llama-server.
OLLAMA: Your Ollama API URL. You should enter it as http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER. If you installed Ollama on port 11434, use http://host.docker.internal:11434. For other ports, adjust accordingly. You need to fill this if you wish to use Ollama's models instead of OpenAI's.
LEMONADE: Your Lemonade API URL. Since Lemonade runs directly on your local machine (not in Docker), you should enter it as http://host.docker.internal:PORT_NUMBER. If you installed Lemonade on port 8000, use http://host.docker.internal:8000. For other ports, adjust accordingly. You need to fill this if you wish to use Lemonade's models.
GROQ: Your Groq API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use Groq's hosted models.`
ANTHROPIC: Your Anthropic API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use Anthropic models.
Gemini: Your Gemini API key. You only need to fill this if you wish to use Google's models.
DEEPSEEK: Your Deepseek API key. Only needed if you want Deepseek models.
AIMLAPI: Your AI/ML API key. Only needed if you want to use AI/ML API models and embeddings.
Note: You can change these after starting Perplexica from the settings dialog.
SIMILARITY_MEASURE: The similarity measure to use (This is filled by default; you can leave it as is if you are unsure about it.)
Ensure you are in the directory containing the docker-compose.yaml file and execute:
docker compose up -d
Wait a few minutes for the setup to complete. You can access Perplexica at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Note: After the containers are built, you can start Perplexica directly from Docker without having to open a terminal.
Non-Docker Installation
Install SearXNG and allow JSON format in the SearXNG settings.
Clone the repository and rename the sample.config.toml file to config.toml in the root directory. Ensure you complete all required fields in this file.
After populating the configuration run npm i.
Install the dependencies and then execute npm run build.
Finally, start the app by running npm run start
Note: Using Docker is recommended as it simplifies the setup process, especially for managing environment variables and dependencies.
See the installation documentation for more information like updating, etc.
Troubleshooting
Local OpenAI-API-Compliant Servers
If Perplexica tells you that you haven't configured any chat model providers, ensure that:
Your server is running on 0.0.0.0 (not 127.0.0.1) and on the same port you put in the API URL.
You have specified the correct model name loaded by your local LLM server.
You have specified the correct API key, or if one is not defined, you have put something in the API key field and not left it empty.
Ollama Connection Errors
If you're encountering an Ollama connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Ollama's API. To fix this issue you can:
Check your Ollama API URL: Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
Update API URL Based on OS:
Windows: Use http://host.docker.internal:11434
Mac: Use http://host.docker.internal:11434
Linux: Use http://<private_ip_of_host>:11434
Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.
Linux Users - Expose Ollama to Network:
Inside /etc/systemd/system/ollama.service, you need to add Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434". (Change the port number if you are using a different one.) Then reload the systemd manager configuration with systemctl daemon-reload, and restart Ollama by systemctl restart ollama. For more information see Ollama docs
Ensure that the port (default is 11434) is not blocked by your firewall.
Lemonade Connection Errors
If you're encountering a Lemonade connection error, it is likely due to the backend being unable to connect to Lemonade's API. To fix this issue you can:
Check your Lemonade API URL: Ensure that the API URL is correctly set in the settings menu.
Update API URL Based on OS:
Windows: Use http://host.docker.internal:8000
Mac: Use http://host.docker.internal:8000
Linux: Use http://<private_ip_of_host>:8000
Adjust the port number if you're using a different one.
Ensure Lemonade Server is Running:
Make sure your Lemonade server is running and accessible on the configured port (default is 8000).
Verify that Lemonade is configured to accept connections from all interfaces (0.0.0.0), not just localhost (127.0.0.1).
Ensure that the port (default is 8000) is not blocked by your firewall.
Using as a Search Engine
If you wish to use Perplexica as an alternative to traditional search engines like Google or Bing, or if you want to add a shortcut for quick access from your browser's search bar, follow these steps:
Open your browser's settings.
Navigate to the 'Search Engines' section.
Add a new site search with the following URL: http://localhost:3000/?q=%s. Replace localhost with your IP address or domain name, and 3000 with the port number if Perplexica is not hosted locally.
Click the add button. Now, you can use Perplexica directly from your browser's search bar.
Using Perplexica's API
Perplexica also provides an API for developers looking to integrate its powerful search engine into their own applications. You can run searches, use multiple models and get answers to your queries.
For more details, check out the full documentation here.
Expose Perplexica to network
Perplexica runs on Next.js and handles all API requests. It works right away on the same network and stays accessible even with port forwarding.
