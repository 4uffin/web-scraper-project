Early-access notice
Memvid v1 is still experimental. The file format and API may change until we lock in a stable release.
Memvid v2 – what's next
Living-Memory Engine – keep adding new data and let LLMs remember it across sessions.
Capsule Context – shareable .mv2 capsules, each with its own rules and expiry.
Time-Travel Debugging – rewind or branch any chat to review or test.
Smart Recall – local cache guesses what you’ll need and loads it in under 5 ms.
Codec Intelligence – auto-tunes AV1 now and future codecs later, so files keep shrinking.
CLI & Dashboard – simple tools for branching, analytics, and one-command cloud publish.
Sneak peek of Memvid v2 - a living memory engine that can be used to chat with your knowledge base.
Memvid v1
Memvid - Turn millions of text chunks into a single, searchable video file
Memvid compresses an entire knowledge base into MP4 files while keeping millisecond-level semantic search. Think of it as SQLite for AI memory portable, efficient, and self-contained. By encoding text as QR codes in video frames, we deliver 50-100× smaller storage than vector databases with zero infrastructure.
Why Video Compression Changes Everything 🚀
What it enables
How video codecs make it possible
50-100× smaller storage
Modern video codecs compress repetitive visual patterns (QR codes) far better than raw embeddings
Sub-100ms retrieval
Direct frame seek via index → QR decode → your text. No server round-trips
Zero infrastructure
Just Python and MP4 files-no DB clusters, no Docker, no ops
True portability
Copy or stream memory.mp4-it works anywhere video plays
Offline-first design
After encoding, everything runs without internet
Under the Hood - Memvid v1 🔍
Text → QR → Frame
Each text chunk becomes a QR code, packed into video frames. Modern codecs excel at compressing these repetitive patterns.
Smart indexing
Embeddings map queries → frame numbers. One seek, one decode, millisecond results.
Codec leverage
30 years of video R&D means your text gets compressed better than any custom algorithm could achieve.
Future-proof
Next-gen codecs (AV1, H.266) automatically make your memories smaller and faster-no code changes needed.
Installation
pip install memvid
# For PDF support
pip install memvid PyPDF2
Quick Start
from memvid import MemvidEncoder, MemvidChat
# Create video memory from text
chunks = ["NASA founded 1958", "Apollo 11 landed 1969", "ISS launched 1998"]
encoder = MemvidEncoder()
encoder.add_chunks(chunks)
encoder.build_video("space.mp4", "space_index.json")
# Chat with your memory
chat = MemvidChat("space.mp4", "space_index.json")
response = chat.chat("When did humans land on the moon?")
print(response)
# References Apollo 11 in 1969
Real-World Examples
Documentation Assistant
from memvid import MemvidEncoder
import os
encoder = MemvidEncoder(chunk_size=512)
# Index all markdown files
for file in os.listdir("docs"):
if file.endswith(".md"):
with open(f"docs/{file}") as f:
encoder.add_text(f.read(), metadata={"file": file})
encoder.build_video("docs.mp4", "docs_index.json")
PDF Library Search
# Index multiple PDFs
encoder = MemvidEncoder()
encoder.add_pdf("deep_learning.pdf")
encoder.add_pdf("machine_learning.pdf")
encoder.build_video("ml_library.mp4", "ml_index.json")
# Semantic search across all books
from memvid import MemvidRetriever
retriever = MemvidRetriever("ml_library.mp4", "ml_index.json")
results = retriever.search("backpropagation", top_k=5)
Interactive Web UI
from memvid import MemvidInteractive
# Launch at http://localhost:7860
interactive = MemvidInteractive("knowledge.mp4", "index.json")
interactive.run()
Advanced Features
Scale Optimization
# Maximum compression for huge datasets
encoder.build_video(
"compressed.mp4",
"index.json",
fps=60,
# More frames/second
frame_size=256,
# Smaller QR codes
video_codec='h265',
# Better compression
crf=28
# Quality tradeoff
)
Custom Embeddings
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
encoder = MemvidEncoder(embedding_model=model)
Parallel Processing
encoder = MemvidEncoder(n_workers=8)
encoder.add_chunks_parallel(million_chunks)
CLI Usage
# Process documents
python examples/file_chat.py --input-dir /docs --provider openai
# Advanced codecs
python examples/file_chat.py --files doc.pdf --codec h265
# Load existing
python examples/file_chat.py --load-existing output/memory
Performance
Indexing: ~10K chunks/second on modern CPUs
Search: <100ms for 1M chunks (includes decode)
Storage: 100MB text → 1-2MB video
Memory: Constant 500MB RAM regardless of size
What's Coming in v2
Delta encoding: Time-travel through knowledge versions
Streaming ingest: Add to videos in real-time
Cloud dashboard: Web UI with API management
Smart codecs: Auto-select AV1/HEVC per content
GPU boost: 100× faster bulk encoding
