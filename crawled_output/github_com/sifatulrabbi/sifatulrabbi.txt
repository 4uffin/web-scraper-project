Hi, I'm
Sifatul Rabbi
I love building software and collaborating with awesome people. Particularly, I dive into things I don't know and produce results. However, my attention span is limited to system design, server apps, web apps, and gen-AI. I enjoy exploring the tech world and mostly use Go, Python, and TypeScript to hack out my curiosities.
