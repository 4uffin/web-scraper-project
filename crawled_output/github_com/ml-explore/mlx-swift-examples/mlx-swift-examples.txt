Developers can use these examples in their own programs -- just import the swift package!
Porting and implementing models
MLXLLMCommon -- common API for LLM and VLM
MLXLLM -- large language model example implementations
MLXVLM -- vision language model example implementations
MLXEmbedders -- popular Encoders / Embedding models example implementations
StableDiffusion -- SDXL Turbo and Stable Diffusion model example implementations
MLXMNIST -- MNIST implementation for all your digit recognition needs
MLX Swift Examples
Example MLX Swift programs.
MNISTTrainer: An example that runs on
both iOS and macOS that downloads MNIST training data and trains a
LeNet.
LLMEval: An example that runs on both iOS
and macOS that downloads an LLM and tokenizer from Hugging Face and
generates text from a given prompt.
VLMEval: An example that runs on iOS, macOS and visionOS to download a VLM and tokenizer from Hugging Face and
analyzes the given image and describe it in text.
MLXChatExample: An example chat app that runs on both iOS and macOS that supports LLMs and VLMs.
LinearModelTraining: An example that
trains a simple linear model.
StableDiffusionExample: An
example that runs on both iOS and macOS that downloads a stable diffusion model
from Hugging Face and
and generates an image from a given prompt.
llm-tool: A command line tool for generating text
using a variety of LLMs available on the Hugging Face hub.
ExampleLLM: A command line tool using the simplified API to interact with LLMs.
image-tool: A command line tool for generating images
using a stable diffusion model from Hugging Face.
mnist-tool: A command line tool for training a
a LeNet on MNIST.
Interacting with LLMs
See also MLXLMCommon.
You can easily use
a wide variety of open weight LLM and VLMs in your code.
You can use
this simplified API:
let model = try await loadModel(id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit")
let session = ChatSession(model)
print(try await session.respond(to: "What are two things to see in San Francisco?")
print(try await session.respond(to: "How about a great place to eat?")
Or use the underlying API to control every aspect of the evaluation.
Running
The application and command line tool examples can be run from Xcode or from
the command line:
./mlx-run llm-tool --prompt "swift programming language"
Note: mlx-run is a shell script that uses xcode command line tools to
locate the built binaries. It is equivalent to running from Xcode itself.

Installation of libraries
The MLXLLM, MLXVLM, MLXLMCommon, MLXMNIST, MLXEmbedders, and StableDiffusion libraries in the example repo are available
as Swift Packages.
Add the following dependency to your Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/", branch: "main"),
Then add one or more libraries to the target as a dependency:
.target(
name: "YourTargetName",
dependencies: [
.product(name: "MLXLLM", package: "mlx-swift-examples")
]),
Alternatively, add https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples/ to the Project Dependencies and set the Dependency Rule to Branch and main in Xcode.
