This repository contains the code and scripts responsible for caching actions locally on a GitHub Actions Runner.
This allows you to speedup actions execution without the cost of downloading actions during the course of your job during the Setup Job step. This repository only caches the most popular first party actions, to save disk space.
A configuration file exists for each repository (see config/actions/). The refs are pinned to specific commit SHAs.
Which refs are included?
By default only main and version tags are included. For example: v1 or v2.0.1
Preview versions are intentionally excluded. For example: v2-beta
Optional args may be supplied to control which refs are included. See script/add-action.sh --help for more info.
How to use this in the self-hosted runner?
Please read the doc @kenmuse has put together at: https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/building-github-actions-runner-images-with-an-action-archive-cache/
