Dependency License Management
This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow,
licensed.yml, that uses
Licensed to check for dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses. This workflow is initially disabled. To
enable the workflow, follow the below steps.
Open licensed.yml
Uncomment the following lines:
# pull_request:
#
branches:
#
- main
# push:
#
branches:
#
- main
Save and commit the changes
Once complete, this workflow will run any time a pull request is created or
changes pushed directly to main. If the workflow detects any dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses, it will fail the workflow and provide details
on the issue(s) found.
Updating Licenses
Whenever you install or update dependencies, you can use the Licensed CLI to
update the licenses database. To install Licensed, see the project's
Readme.
To update the cached licenses, run the following command:
licensed cache
To check the status of cached licenses, run the following command:
licensed status
