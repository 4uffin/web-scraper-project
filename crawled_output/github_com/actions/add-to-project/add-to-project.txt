Use this action to automatically add the current issue or pull request to a GitHub project.
Note that this action does not support GitHub projects (classic).
Current Status
Usage
See action.yml for metadata that defines the inputs, outputs, and runs configuration for this action.
For more information about workflows, see Using workflows.
Create a workflow that runs when Issues or Pull Requests are opened or labeled in your repository; this workflow also supports adding Issues to your project which are transferred into your repository. Optionally configure any filters you may want to add, such as only adding issues with certain labels. You may match labels with an AND or an OR operator, or exclude labels with a NOT operator.
Once you've configured your workflow, save it as a .yml file in your target Repository's .github/workflows directory.

Inputs
Supported Events

License
Inputs
project-url (required) is the URL of the GitHub project to add issues to.
eg: https://github.com/orgs|users/<ownerName>/projects/<projectNumber>
github-token (required) is a personal access
token with repo and project scopes.
See Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository for more details
labeled (optional) is a comma-separated list of labels used to filter applicable issues. When this key is provided, an issue must have one of the labels in the list to be added to the project. Omitting this key means that any issue will be added.
label-operator (optional) is the behavior of the labels filter, either AND, OR or NOT that controls if the issue should be matched with all labeled input or any of them, default is OR.
Supported Events
Currently this action supports the following issues events:
opened
reopened
transferred
labeled
and the following pull_request events:
opened
reopened
labeled
Using these events ensure that a given issue or pull request, in the workflow's repo, is added to the specified project. If labeled input(s) are defined, then issues will only be added if they contain at least one of the labels in the list.
Creating a PAT and adding it to your repository
Create a new personal access token. See Creating a personal access token for more information
For Tokens (classic) include the project scope; for private repos you will also need repo scope.
For Fine-grained tokens, you must first select the appropriate owner and associated repositories. Then select Organization permissions -> projects read & write, and Repository permissions -> issues read-only and pull requests read-only.
add the newly created PAT as a repository secret, this secret will be referenced by the github-token input
See Encrypted secrets for more information
Setting a specific status or column name to the project item
If you want to add an issue to a custom default column in a project (i.e. other than 'Todo'), you can do this directly via the project UI. You don't need to add anything else to your YAML workflow file to get this to work.
Use the Add To GitHub Projects action to assign newly opened issues to the project. And then in the project UI simply specify which column to use as the default!
Development
To get started contributing to this project, clone it and install dependencies.
Note that this action runs in Node.js 20.x, so we recommend using that version
of Node (see "engines" in this action's package.json for details).
> git clone https://github.com/actions/add-to-project
> cd add-to-project
> npm install
Or, use GitHub Codespaces.
See the toolkit
documentation
for the various packages used in building this action.
Publish to a distribution branch
Actions are run from GitHub repositories, so we check in the packaged action in
the "dist/" directory.
> npm run build
> git add lib dist
> git commit -a -m "Build and package"
> git push origin releases/v1
Now, a release can be created from the branch containing the built action.
