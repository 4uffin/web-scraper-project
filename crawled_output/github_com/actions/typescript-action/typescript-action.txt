Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action. 🚀
This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow,
publishing, and versioning guidance.
If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction in the
Hello world JavaScript action repository.
Create Your Own Action
To create your own action, you can use this repository as a template! Just
follow the below instructions:
Click the Use this template button at the top of the repository
Select Create a new repository
Select an owner and name for your new repository
Click Create repository
Clone your new repository
Important
Make sure to remove or update the CODEOWNERS file! For
details on how to use this file, see
About code owners.
Initial Setup
After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.
Note
You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
Node.js handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
using a version manager like nodenv or
fnm, this template has a .node-version
file at the root of the repository that can be used to automatically switch to
the correct version when you cd into the repository. Additionally, this
.node-version file is used by GitHub Actions in any actions/setup-node
actions.
🛠️ Install the dependencies
npm install
🏗️ Package the TypeScript for distribution
npm run bundle
✅ Run the tests
$ npm test
PASS
./index.test.js
✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
✓ test runs (95ms)
...
Update the Action Metadata
The action.yml file defines metadata about your action, such as
input(s) and output(s). For details about this file, see
Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions.
When you copy this repository, update action.yml with the name, description,
inputs, and outputs for your action.
Update the Action Code
The src/ directory is the heart of your action! This contains the
source code that will be run when your action is invoked. You can replace the
contents of this directory with your own code.
There are a few things to keep in mind when writing your action code:
Most GitHub Actions toolkit and CI/CD operations are processed asynchronously.
In main.ts, you will see that the action is run in an async function.
import * as core from '@actions/core'
//...
async function run() {
try {
//...
} catch (error) {
core.setFailed(error.message)
}
}
For more information about the GitHub Actions toolkit, see the
documentation.
So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and start customizing your action!
Create a new branch
git checkout -b releases/v1
Replace the contents of src/ with your action code
Add tests to __tests__/ for your source code
Format, test, and build the action
npm run all
This step is important! It will run rollup to
build the final JavaScript action code with all dependencies included. If
you do not run this step, your action will not work correctly when it is
used in a workflow.
(Optional) Test your action locally
The @github/local-action utility
can be used to test your action locally. It is a simple command-line tool
that "stubs" (or simulates) the GitHub Actions Toolkit. This way, you can run
your TypeScript action locally without having to commit and push your changes
to a repository.
The local-action utility can be run in the following ways:
Visual Studio Code Debugger
Make sure to review and, if needed, update
.vscode/launch.json
Terminal/Command Prompt
# npx @github/local action <action-yaml-path> <entrypoint> <dotenv-file>
npx @github/local-action . src/main.ts .env
You can provide a .env file to the local-action CLI to set environment
variables used by the GitHub Actions Toolkit. For example, setting inputs and
event payload data used by your action. For more information, see the example
file, .env.example, and the
GitHub Actions Documentation.
Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "My first action is ready!"
Push them to your repository
git push -u origin releases/v1
Create a pull request and get feedback on your action
Merge the pull request into the main branch
Your action is now published! 🚀
For information about versioning your action, see
Versioning
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.
Validate the Action
You can now validate the action by referencing it in a workflow file. For
example, ci.yml demonstrates how to reference an
action in the same repository.
steps:
- name: Checkout
id: checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Test Local Action
id: test-action
uses: ./
with:
milliseconds: 1000
- name: Print Output
id: output
run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
For example workflow runs, check out the
Actions tab! 🚀
Usage
After testing, you can create version tag(s) that developers can use to
reference different stable versions of your action. For more information, see
Versioning
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.
To include the action in a workflow in another repository, you can use the
uses syntax with the @ symbol to reference a specific branch, tag, or commit
hash.
steps:
- name: Checkout
id: checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Test Local Action
id: test-action
uses: actions/typescript-action@v1 # Commit with the `v1` tag
with:
milliseconds: 1000
- name: Print Output
id: output
run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
Publishing a New Release
This project includes a helper script, script/release
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.
GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:
Retrieving the latest release tag: The script starts by fetching the most
recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
available in your repository.
Prompting for a new release tag: The user is then prompted to enter a new
release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
Tagging the new release: The script then tags a new release and syncs the
separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
auto-detects this and creates a releases/v# branch for the previous major
version.
Pushing changes to remote: Finally, the script pushes the necessary
commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
in their workflows.
Dependency License Management
This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow,
licensed.yml, that uses
Licensed to check for dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses. This workflow is initially disabled. To
enable the workflow, follow the below steps.
Open licensed.yml
Uncomment the following lines:
# pull_request:
#
branches:
#
- main
# push:
#
branches:
#
- main
Save and commit the changes
Once complete, this workflow will run any time a pull request is created or
changes pushed directly to main. If the workflow detects any dependencies with
missing or non-compliant licenses, it will fail the workflow and provide details
on the issue(s) found.
Updating Licenses
Whenever you install or update dependencies, you can use the Licensed CLI to
update the licenses database. To install Licensed, see the project's
Readme.
To update the cached licenses, run the following command:
licensed cache
To check the status of cached licenses, run the following command:
licensed status
