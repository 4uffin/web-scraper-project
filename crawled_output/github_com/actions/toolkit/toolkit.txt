Creating an Action with the Toolkit
❓ Choosing an action type
Outlines the differences and why you would want to create a JavaScript or a container based action.
➰ Versioning
Actions are downloaded and run from the GitHub graph of repos.
This contains guidance for versioning actions and safe releases.
⚠️ Problem Matchers
Problem Matchers are a way to scan the output of actions for a specified regex pattern and surface that information prominently in the UI.
⚠️ Proxy Server Support
Self-hosted runners can be configured to run behind proxy servers.
Hello World JavaScript Action
Illustrates how to create a simple hello world javascript action.
...
const nameToGreet = core.getInput('who-to-greet');
console.log(`Hello ${nameToGreet}!`);
...
JavaScript Action Walkthrough
Walkthrough and template for creating a JavaScript Action with tests, linting, workflow, publishing, and versioning.
async function run() {
try {
const ms = core.getInput('milliseconds');
console.log(`Waiting ${ms} milliseconds ...`)
...
PASS ./index.test.js
✓ throws invalid number
✓ wait 500 ms
✓ test runs
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:
3 passed, 3 total
TypeScript Action Walkthrough
Walkthrough creating a TypeScript Action with compilation, tests, linting, workflow, publishing, and versioning.
import * as core from '@actions/core';
async function run() {
try {
const ms = core.getInput('milliseconds');
console.log(`Waiting ${ms} milliseconds ...`)
...
PASS ./index.test.js
✓ throws invalid number
✓ wait 500 ms
✓ test runs
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:
3 passed, 3 total
Docker Action Walkthrough
Create an action that is delivered as a container and run with docker.
FROM alpine:3.10
COPY LICENSE README.md /
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
Docker Action Walkthrough with Octokit
Create an action that is delivered as a container which uses the toolkit.
This example uses the GitHub context to construct an Octokit client.
FROM node:slim
COPY . .
RUN npm install --production
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/lib/main.js"]
const myInput = core.getInput('myInput');
core.debug(`Hello ${myInput} from inside a container`);
const context = github.context;
console.log(`We can even get context data, like the repo: ${context.repo.repo}`)
Note
Thank you for your interest in this GitHub repo, however, right now we are not taking contributions.
We continue to focus our resources on strategic areas that help our customers be successful while making developers' lives easier. While GitHub Actions remains a key part of this vision, we are allocating resources towards other areas of Actions and are not taking contributions to this repository at this time. The GitHub public roadmap is the best place to follow along for any updates on features we’re working on and what stage they’re in.
We are taking the following steps to better direct requests related to GitHub Actions, including:
We will be directing questions and support requests to our Community Discussions area
High Priority bugs can be reported through Community Discussions or you can report these to our support team https://support.github.com/contact/bug-report.
