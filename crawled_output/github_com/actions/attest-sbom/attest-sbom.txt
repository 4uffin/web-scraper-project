Generate signed SBOM attestations for workflow artifacts. Internally powered by
the @actions/attest package.
Attestations bind some subject (a named artifact along with its digest) to a a
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using the in-toto format. The action
accepts SBOMs which have been generated by external tools. Provided SBOMs must
be in either the SPDX or CycloneDX JSON-serialized format.
A verifiable signature is generated for the attestation using a short-lived
Sigstore-issued signing certificate. If the repository initiating the
GitHub Actions workflow is public, the public-good instance of Sigstore will be
used to generate the attestation signature. If the repository is
private/internal, it will use the GitHub private Sigstore instance.
Once the attestation has been created and signed, it will be uploaded to the GH
attestations API and associated with the repository from which the workflow was
initiated.
Attestations can be verified using the attestation command in the GitHub
CLI.
See Using artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds for
more information on artifact attestations.
NoteArtifact attestations are available in public repositories for all
current GitHub plans. They are not available on legacy plans, such as Bronze,
Silver, or Gold. If you are on a GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, or GitHub Team plan,
artifact attestations are only available for public repositories. To use
artifact attestations in private or internal repositories, you must be on a
GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan.
Usage
Within the GitHub Actions workflow which builds some artifact you would like to
attest:
Ensure that the following permissions are set:
permissions:
id-token: write
attestations: write
The id-token permission gives the action the ability to mint the OIDC token
necessary to request a Sigstore signing certificate. The attestations
permission is necessary to persist the attestation.
Add the following to your workflow after your artifact has been built and
your SBOM has been generated:
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-path: '<PATH TO ARTIFACT>'
sbom-path: '<PATH TO SBOM>'
The subject-path parameter should identify the artifact for which you want
to generate an SBOM attestation. The sbom-path parameter should identify
the SBOM document to be associated with the subject.
Inputs
See action.yml
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
# Path to the artifact serving as the subject of the attestation. Must
# specify exactly one of "subject-path", "subject-digest", or
# "subject-checksums". May contain a glob pattern or list of paths
# (total subject count cannot exceed 1024).
subject-path:
# SHA256 digest of the subject for the attestation. Must be in the form
# "sha256:hex_digest" (e.g. "sha256:abc123..."). Must specify exactly one
# of "subject-path", "subject-digest", or "subject-checksums".
subject-digest:
# Subject name as it should appear in the attestation. Required when
# identifying the subject with the "subject-digest" input.
subject-name:
# Path to checksums file containing digest and name of subjects for
# attestation. Must specify exactly one of "subject-path", "subject-digest",
# or "subject-checksums".
subject-checksums:
# Path to the JSON-formatted SBOM file to attest. File size cannot exceed
# 16MB.
sbom-path:
# Whether to push the attestation to the image registry. Requires that the
# "subject-name" parameter specify the fully-qualified image name and that
# the "subject-digest" parameter be specified. Defaults to false.
push-to-registry:
# Whether to attach a list of generated attestations to the workflow run
# summary page. Defaults to true.
show-summary:
# The GitHub token used to make authenticated API requests. Default is
# ${{ github.token }}
github-token:
Outputs
Name
Description
Example
attestation-id
GitHub ID for the attestation
123456
attestation-url
URL for the attestation summary
https://github.com/foo/bar/attestations/123456
bundle-path
Absolute path to the file containing the generated attestation
/tmp/attestation.json
Attestations are saved in the JSON-serialized Sigstore bundle format.
If multiple subjects are being attested at the same time, a single attestation
will be created with references to each of the supplied subjects.
The absolute path to the generated attestation is appended to the file
${RUNNER_TEMP}/created_attestation_paths.txt. This file will accumulate the
paths to all attestations created over the course of a single workflow.
Attestation Limits
Subject Limits
No more than 1024 subjects can be attested at the same time.
SBOM Limits
The SBOM supplied via the sbom-path input cannot exceed 16MB.
Examples
Identify Subject and SBOM by Path
For the basic use case, simply add the attest-sbom action to your workflow and
supply the path to the artifact and SBOM for which you want to generate
attestation.
name: build-attest
on:
workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
permissions:
id-token: write
contents: read
attestations: write
steps:
- name: Checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Build artifact
run: make my-app
- name: Generate SBOM
uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
with:
format: 'spdx-json'
output-file: 'sbom.spdx.json'
- name: Attest
uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-path: '${{ github.workspace }}/my-app'
sbom-path: 'sbom.spdx.json'
Identify Multiple Subjects
If you are generating multiple artifacts, you can attest all of them at the same
time by using a wildcard in the subject-path input.
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-path: 'dist/**/my-bin-*'
sbom-path: '${{ github.workspace }}/my-bin.sbom.spdx.json'
For supported wildcards along with behavior and documentation, see
@actions/glob which is used internally to search for files.
Alternatively, you can explicitly list multiple subjects with either a comma or
newline delimited list:
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-path: 'dist/foo, dist/bar'
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-path: |
dist/foo
dist/bar
Identify Subjects with Checksums File
If you are using tools like
goreleaser or
jreleaser which
generate a checksums file you can identify the attestation subjects by passing
the path of the checksums file to the subject-checksums input. Each of the
artifacts identified in the checksums file will be listed as a subject for the
attestation.
- name: Calculate artifact digests
run: |
shasum -a 256 foo_0.0.1_* > subject.checksums.txt
- uses: actions/attest-sbom@v3
with:
subject-checksums: subject.checksums.txt
sbom-path: sbom.spdx.json
The file referenced by the subject-checksums input must conform to the same
format used by the shasum tools. Each subject should be listed on a separate
line including the hex-encoded digest (either SHA256 or SHA512), a space, a
single character flag indicating either binary (*) or text ( ) input mode,
and the filename.

Container Image
When working with container images you can invoke the action with the
subject-name and subject-digest inputs.
If you want to publish the attestation to the container registry with the
push-to-registry option, it is important that the subject-name specify the
fully-qualified image name (e.g. "ghcr.io/user/app" or
"acme.azurecr.io/user/app"). Do NOT include a tag as part of the image name --
the specific image being attested is identified by the supplied digest.
NOTE: When pushing to Docker Hub, please use "index.docker.io" as the
registry portion of the image name.
