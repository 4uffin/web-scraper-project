Please note: this action is for internal usage only, issues are disabled and contributing PRs will not be reviewed. We also do not recommend this action for public or production usage while it is still in development.
This action adds reliability to the new action versions publishing and handles the following cases:
Update a major tag (v1, for example) to point to the latest release (v1.2.1, for example).
Create a major tag from the latest released tag if a major tag doesn't exist
Status
Alpha. Action is under development and internal testing.
Usage
This action can be triggered automatically when a release is created or manually using a workflow_dispatch event. The actual major tag update will require manual approval.
See release-new-action-version.yml for usage example.
See action.yml for a complete description of input and output fields.
Read more about action versioning notation in action-versioning.md.
To roll back a release in case of customer impact, start the workflow manually and specify the previous stable tag.
Recommended permissions
When using the publish-action in your GitHub Actions workflow, it is recommended to set the following permissions to ensure proper functionality:
permissions:
contents: write # access to publish release
Conributions
We don't accept contributions until the action is ready for production.
