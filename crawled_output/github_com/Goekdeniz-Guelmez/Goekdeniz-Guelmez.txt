Goekdeniz-Guelmez/README.md
Hello, I'm Gökdeniz Gülmez 👋
🚀 About Me
Hey, I’m Gökdeniz Gülmez — an ML researcher and engineer. When I’m not building production systems, I’m deep in the MLX ecosystem, contributing to cutting-edge tooling for Apple Silicon.
I'm a contributor to mlx-vlm, mlx-examples, mlx-lm, and mlx, officially acknowledged by the MLX team — check here for mlx-examples, mlx-lm or mlx if you don’t believe me.
📦 Creator of:
MLX-LM-LENS: Abliterate and research the inner thoughs of LLMs
MLX-LM-LoRA: Train models natively on Apple Silicon
MLX-KAN: KANs implemented natively in MLX
Local NotebookLM: Run your own "NotebookLM" locally with PDF context
🧠 What I’ve built into MLX nd MLX-LM:
Support for multiple LLM architectures, and training features like:
OpenBMB's MiniCPM and MiniCPM3,
Kyutai's Helium,
State-Space's Mamba v1 and Mamb v2,
Z.ai & THUKEG's GLM4,
Rednote dots.llm1,
Baisu's Ernie4.5 MoE,
inclusionAI's Bailing MoE e.g. Ling-family,
IBM's Granite MoE,
Meituan's LongCat,
Nvidia's Nemotron H,
Swiss-AI's Apertus,
Allenai's OLMoE,
Full Weight Fine-Tuning,
Support for the Muon optimize (both mlx-lm and mlx),
Reporting training metrics to WandB (Weights & Biases)
Multiple Optimizers to choose for training
ReLU² activation function in mlx
📚 My Projects
A mix of serious deep learning research and fun, experimental tools. Expect anything from multimodal LLMs to dataset labeling UIs and decentralized training methods.
🎯 My Interests
🤖 Artificial & General Intelligence
🧠 Deep Learning, Transformer Architectures, LoRA magic
🎻 Violin — Currently practicing Paganini and Bach
🖌️ Occasionally sketching or doing photography for inspiration
📺 Huge anime fan (yes, I have seen Berserk)
🌱 Currently Building:
J.O.S.I.E.-Home — my vision for an all-in-one personal assistant
A Real-Time, Full-Duplex, Multimodal Model that can:
Control my smart home (sensors, cameras, LEDs, etc.) autonomously
Understand text, images, videos, and raw audio (like Whisper + GPT-4o but better)
Output natural speech & engage in open-ended, real-time convos
Self-update its memory and tools
Be fully local, private, and offline-first
Think and act like an autonomous agent with personality
🌱 I’m currently working on...
Autonomous Smart home automation using a Real-Time, Multi-Modal-Large-Language-Model. capable text-audio-vision to text-audio (Project J.O.S.I.E.-Home).
A secret new ML theorem.
My gabliteration Paper
Github Stats
My private goal is to create J.O.S.I.E.
My own private smart home management Multi-Modal-Large-Language-Model Assistant that can...
Autonomously control and manage my Smart home with sensors, cameras, LEDs, and all the other products.
Tool calling capabilies.
Raw audio input with normal user(s) speech and other sounds like (fire, etc.).
Capable of understanding videos and images (e.g. security cameras).
Capable of outputting natural assistant audio speech and Text (like GPT4-o).
Can be Real-Time and Text only like GPT4-o.
Updating itself Autonomously.
Having a long-/short-term Memory, and even updating it autonimously.
Real-Time-full-duplex-Multi-Modal-Model
Starting a conversation by itself (She donsn't need special user and assistant turns).
And much more...
