MinuraPunchihewa/README.md
Hello, World ðŸ‘‹,
I identify primarily as a Software Engineer, but I often don the hat of a Data Engineer when the need arises.
I'm here to build cool things, break a few (responsibly), and learn something new every step of the way. Whether it's my own project or someone elseâ€™s, my goal is to leave a trail of show-stopping bugs, occasional breakthroughs, and contributions that make people wonder, "Who built this?!".
That will be my legacy.
ðŸ’»âœ¨ðŸ’ª Stuff I think I am good at: Python, SQL, Spark, Databricks, Docker and Azure.
ðŸŒ±ðŸ“šðŸ¤ž Stuff I want to be good at: Rust, GraphQL, React, TypeScript and Kubernetes.
ðŸ“« How to Reach Me
ðŸ“§ Email: minurapuchihewa17@gmail.com
ðŸ“± LinkedIn: minurapunchihewa
