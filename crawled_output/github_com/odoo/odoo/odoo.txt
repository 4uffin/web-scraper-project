Odoo is a suite of web based open source business apps.
The main Odoo Apps include an Open Source CRM,
Website Builder,
eCommerce,
Warehouse Management,
Project Management,
Billing & Accounting,
Point of Sale,
Human Resources,
Marketing,
Manufacturing,
...
Odoo Apps can be used as stand-alone applications, but they also integrate seamlessly so you get
a full-featured Open Source ERP when you install several Apps.
Getting started with Odoo
For a standard installation please follow the Setup instructions
from the documentation.
To learn the software, we recommend the Odoo eLearning,
or Scale-up, the business game.
Developers can start with the developer tutorials.
