Introduction
WebGoat is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web
application security lessons.
This program is a demonstration of common server-side application flaws. The
exercises are intended to be used by people to learn about application security and
penetration testing techniques.
WARNING 1: While running this program your machine will be extremely
vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using
this program.
WebGoat's default configuration binds to localhost to minimize
the exposure.
WARNING 2: This program is for educational purposes only. If you attempt
these techniques without authorization, you are very likely to get caught. If
you are caught engaging in unauthorized hacking, most companies will fire you.
Claiming that you were doing security research will not work as that is the
first thing that all hackers claim.
Installation instructions:
For more details check the Contribution guide
1. Run using Docker
Already have a browser and ZAP and/or Burp installed on your machine in this case you can run the WebGoat image directly using Docker.
Every release is also published on DockerHub.
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 webgoat/webgoat
For some lessons you need the container run in the same timezone. For this you can set the TZ environment variable.
E.g.
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
If you want to use OWASP ZAP or another proxy, you can no longer use 127.0.0.1 or localhost. but
you can use custom host entries. For example:
127.0.0.1 www.webgoat.local www.webwolf.local
Then you can run the container with:
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e WEBGOAT_HOST=www.webgoat.local -e WEBWOLF_HOST=www.webwolf.local -e TZ=America/Boise webgoat/webgoat
Then visit http://www.webgoat.local:8080/WebGoat/ and http://www.webwolf.local:9090/WebWolf/
2. Run using Docker with complete Linux Desktop
Instead of installing tools locally we have a complete Docker image based on running a desktop in your browser. This way you only have to run a Docker image which will give you the best user experience.
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 webgoat/webgoat-desktop
3. Standalone
Download the latest WebGoat release from https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat/releases
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar
Click the link in the log to start WebGoat.
3.1 Running on a different port
If for some reason you want to run WebGoat on a different port, you can do so by adding the following parameter:
java -jar webgoat-2023.8.jar --webgoat.port=8001 --webwolf.port=8002
For a full overview of all the parameters you can use, please check the [WebGoat properties file](webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application-{webgoat, webwolf}.properties).
4. Run from the sources
Prerequisites:
Java 23
Your favorite IDE
Git, or Git support in your IDE
Open a command shell/window:
git clone git@github.com:WebGoat/WebGoat.git
Now let's start by compiling the project.
cd WebGoat
git checkout <<branch_name>>
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw clean install
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd clean install
# Using docker or podman, you can than build the container locally
docker build -f Dockerfile . -t webgoat/webgoat
Now we are ready to run the project. WebGoat is using Spring Boot.
# On Linux/Mac:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows:
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
... you should be running WebGoat on http://localhost:8080/WebGoat momentarily.
Note: The above link will redirect you to login page if you are not logged in. LogIn/Create account to proceed.
To change the IP address add the following variable to the WebGoat/webgoat-container/src/main/resources/application.properties file:
server.address=x.x.x.x
4. Run with custom menu
For specialist only. There is a way to set up WebGoat with a personalized menu. You can leave out some menu categories or individual lessons by setting certain environment variables.
For instance running as a jar on a Linux/macOS it will look like this:
export TZ=Europe/Amsterdam # or your timezone
export EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES="CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE"
export EXCLUDE_LESSONS="SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations"
java -jar target/webgoat-2023.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
Or in a docker run it would (once this version is pushed into docker hub) look like this:
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:9090:9090 -e EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES="CLIENT_SIDE,GENERAL,CHALLENGE" -e EXCLUDE_LESSONS="SqlInjectionAdvanced,SqlInjectionMitigations" webgoat/webgoat
