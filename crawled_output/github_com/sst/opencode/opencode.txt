Contributing
opencode is an opinionated tool so any fundamental feature needs to go through a
design process with the core team.
ImportantWe do not accept PRs for core features.
However we still merge a ton of PRs - you can contribute:
Bug fixes
Improvements to LLM performance
Support for new providers
Fixes for env specific quirks
Missing standard behavior
Documentation
Take a look at the git history to see what kind of PRs we end up merging.
NoteIf you do not follow the above guidelines we might close your PR.
To run opencode locally you need.
Bun
Golang 1.24.x
And run.
$ bun install
$ bun dev
Development Notes
API Client: After making changes to the TypeScript API endpoints in packages/opencode/src/server/server.ts, you will need the opencode team to generate a new stainless sdk for the clients.
FAQ
How is this different than Claude Code?
It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:
100% open source
Not coupled to any provider. Although Anthropic is recommended, opencode can be used with OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
A focus on TUI. opencode is built by neovim users and the creators of terminal.shop; we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
A client/server architecture. This for example can allow opencode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.
What's the other repo?
The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can read the story behind it here.
