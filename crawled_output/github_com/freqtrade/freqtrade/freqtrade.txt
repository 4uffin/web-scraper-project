Development branches
The project is currently setup in two main branches:
develop - This branch has often new features, but might also contain breaking changes. We try hard to keep this branch as stable as possible.
stable - This branch contains the latest stable release. This branch is generally well tested.
feat/* - These are feature branches, which are being worked on heavily. Please don't use these unless you want to test a specific feature.
Support
Help / Discord
For any questions not covered by the documentation or for further information about the bot, or to simply engage with like-minded individuals, we encourage you to join the Freqtrade discord server.
Bugs / Issues
If you discover a bug in the bot, please
search the issue tracker
first. If it hasn't been reported, please
create a new issue and
ensure you follow the template guide so that the team can assist you as
quickly as possible.
For every issue created, kindly follow up and mark satisfaction or reminder to close issue when equilibrium ground is reached.
--Maintain github's community policy--
Feature Requests
Have you a great idea to improve the bot you want to share? Please,
first search if this feature was not already discussed.
If it hasn't been requested, please
create a new request
and ensure you follow the template guide so that it does not get lost
in the bug reports.
Pull Requests
Feel like the bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests!
Please read the
Contributing document
to understand the requirements before sending your pull-requests.
Coding is not a necessity to contribute - maybe start with improving the documentation?
Issues labeled good first issue can be good first contributions, and will help get you familiar with the codebase.
Note before starting any major new feature work, please open an issue describing what you are planning to do or talk to us on discord (please use the #dev channel for this). This will ensure that interested parties can give valuable feedback on the feature, and let others know that you are working on it.
Important: Always create your PR against the develop branch, not stable.

Up-to-date clock
The clock must be accurate, synchronized to a NTP server very frequently to avoid problems with communication to the exchanges.
