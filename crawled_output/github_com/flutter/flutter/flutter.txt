Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and
open source.

Contributing to Flutter
For announcements about new releases, follow the
flutter-announce@googlegroups.com
mailing list. Our documentation also tracks breaking
changes across releases.
Terms of service
The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms
For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the flutter tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the flutter upgrade command).
About Flutter
We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,
web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of
your choice.
Beautiful user experiences
We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's layered architecture gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
set of widgets that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether
you're building for iOS (Cupertino) or other platforms (Material), along with
support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.
Fast results
Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
libraries like Skia (which underpins Chrome and Android) and
Impeller. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.
Flutter code is powered by the world-class Dart platform, which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android,
JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM
for desktop devices.
Productive development
Flutter offers stateful hot reload, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.
Extensible and open model
Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes
editor plug-ins for both Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ / Android Studio.
Flutter provides tens of thousands of packages to speed your
development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code
is easy, with support for both FFI (on Android, on iOS,
on macOS, and on Windows) as well as
platform-specific APIs.
Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found in our
contributor guide.
