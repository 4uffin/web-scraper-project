Auto-upstall
Auto-upstall is a single command that sets up NocoDB on a server for production usage.
Behind the scenes it auto-generates docker-compose for you.
bash <(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) <(mktemp)
Auto-upstall does the following: 🕊
🐳 Automatically installs all pre-requisites like docker, docker-compose
🚀 Automatically installs NocoDB with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio, Traefik gateway using Docker Compose. 🐘 🗄️ 🌐
🔄 Automatically upgrades NocoDB to the latest version when you run the command again.
🔒 Automatically setups SSL and also renews it. Needs a domain or subdomain as input while installation.
install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script can be found here in our github

Why are we building this?
Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes & most importantly a glass ceiling on what's possible in the future.
Our Mission
Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases that is open source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on the internet.
