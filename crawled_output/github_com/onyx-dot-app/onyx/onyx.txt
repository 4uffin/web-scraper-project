Open Source AI Platform
Onyx is a feature-rich, self-hostable Chat UI that works with any LLM. It is easy to deploy and can run in a completely airgapped environment.
Onyx comes loaded with advanced features like Agents, Web Search, RAG, MCP, Deep Research, Connectors to 40+ knowledge sources, and more.
TipRun Onyx with one command (or see deployment section below):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/main/deployment/docker_compose/install.sh > install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
⭐ Features
🤖 Custom Agents: Build AI Agents with unique instructions, knowledge and actions.
🌍 Web Search: Browse the web with Google PSE, Exa, and Serper as well as an in-house scraper or Firecrawl.
🔍 RAG: Best in class hybrid-search + knowledge graph for uploaded files and ingested documents from connectors.
🔄 Connectors: Pull knowledge, metadata, and access information from over 40 applications.
🔬 Deep Research: Get in depth answers with an agentic multi-step search.
▶️ Actions & MCP: Give AI Agents the ability to interact with external systems.
💻 Code Interpreter: Execute code to analyze data, render graphs and create files.
🎨 Image Generation: Generate images based on user prompts.
👥 Collaboration: Chat sharing, feedback gathering, user management, usage analytics, and more.
Onyx works with all LLMs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) and self-hosted LLMs (like Ollama, vLLM, etc.)
To learn more about the features, check out our documentation!
🚀 Deployment
Onyx supports deployments in Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, along with guides for major cloud providers.
See guides below:
Docker or Quickstart (best for most users)
Kubernetes (best for large teams)
Terraform (best for teams already using Terraform)
Cloud specific guides (best if specifically using AWS EKS, Azure VMs, etc.)
TipTo try Onyx for free without deploying, check out Onyx Cloud.
🔍 Other Notable Benefits
Onyx is built for teams of all sizes, from individual users to the largest global enterprises.
Enterprise Search: far more than simple RAG, Onyx has custom indexing and retrieval that remains performant and accurate for scales of up to tens of millions of documents.
Security: SSO (OIDC/SAML/OAuth2), RBAC, encryption of credentials, etc.
Management UI: different user roles such as basic, curator, and admin.
Document Permissioning: mirrors user access from external apps for RAG use cases.
