🦥 Unsloth.ai News
📣 Vision RL You can now train VLMs with GRPO or GSPO in Unsloth! Read guide
📣 Memory-efficient RL We're introducing even better RL. Our new kernels & algos allows faster RL with 50% less VRAM & 10× more context. Read blog
📣 gpt-oss by OpenAI: For details on Unsloth Flex Attention, long-context training, bug fixes, Read our Guide. 20B works on a 14GB GPU and 120B on 65GB VRAM. gpt-oss uploads.
📣 Gemma 3n by Google: Read Blog. We uploaded GGUFs, 4-bit models.
📣 Text-to-Speech (TTS) is now supported, including sesame/csm-1b and STT openai/whisper-large-v3.
📣 Qwen3 is now supported. Qwen3-30B-A3B fits on 17.5GB VRAM.
📣 Introducing Dynamic 2.0 quants that set new benchmarks on 5-shot MMLU & KL Divergence.
📣 EVERYTHING is now supported - all models (BERT, diffusion, Cohere, Mamba), FFT, etc. MultiGPU coming soon. Enable FFT with full_finetuning = True, 8-bit with load_in_8bit = True.
Click for more news
📣 DeepSeek-R1 - run or fine-tune them with our guide. All model uploads: here.
📣 Introducing Long-context Reasoning (GRPO) in Unsloth. Train your own reasoning model with just 5GB VRAM. Transform Llama, Phi, Mistral etc. into reasoning LLMs!
📣 Introducing Unsloth Dynamic 4-bit Quantization! We dynamically opt not to quantize certain parameters and this greatly increases accuracy while only using <10% more VRAM than BnB 4-bit. See our collection on Hugging Face here.
📣 Llama 4 by Meta, including Scout & Maverick are now supported.
📣 Phi-4 by Microsoft: We also fixed bugs in Phi-4 and uploaded GGUFs, 4-bit.
📣 Vision models now supported! Llama 3.2 Vision (11B), Qwen 2.5 VL (7B) and Pixtral (12B) 2409
📣 Llama 3.3 (70B), Meta's latest model is supported.
📣 We worked with Apple to add Cut Cross Entropy. Unsloth now supports 89K context for Meta's Llama 3.3 (70B) on a 80GB GPU - 13x longer than HF+FA2. For Llama 3.1 (8B), Unsloth enables 342K context, surpassing its native 128K support.
📣 We found and helped fix a gradient accumulation bug! Please update Unsloth and transformers.
📣 We cut memory usage by a further 30% and now support 4x longer context windows!

⭐ Key Features
Supports full-finetuning, pretraining, 4b-bit, 16-bit and 8-bit training
Supports all transformer-style models including TTS, STT, multimodal, diffusion, BERT and more!
All kernels written in OpenAI's Triton language. Manual backprop engine.
0% loss in accuracy - no approximation methods - all exact.
No change of hardware. Supports NVIDIA GPUs since 2018+. Minimum CUDA Capability 7.0 (V100, T4, Titan V, RTX 20, 30, 40x, A100, H100, L40 etc) Check your GPU! GTX 1070, 1080 works, but is slow.
Works on Linux and Windows
If you trained a model with 🦥Unsloth, you can use this cool sticker!
💾 Install Unsloth
WarningPython 3.14 does not support Unsloth. Use 3.13 or lower.
You can also see our documentation for more detailed installation and updating instructions here.
Pip Installation
Install with pip (recommended) for Linux devices:
pip install unsloth
To update Unsloth:
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir unsloth unsloth_zoo
See here for advanced pip install instructions.
Windows Installation
Install NVIDIA Video Driver:
You should install the latest version of your GPUs driver. Download drivers here: NVIDIA GPU Drive.
Install Visual Studio C++:
You will need Visual Studio, with C++ installed. By default, C++ is not installed with Visual Studio, so make sure you select all of the C++ options. Also select options for Windows 10/11 SDK. For detailed instructions with options, see here.
Install CUDA Toolkit:
Follow the instructions to install CUDA Toolkit.
Install PyTorch:
You will need the correct version of PyTorch that is compatible with your CUDA drivers, so make sure to select them carefully.
Install PyTorch.
Install Unsloth:
pip install unsloth
Notes
To run Unsloth directly on Windows:
Install Triton from this Windows fork and follow the instructions here (be aware that the Windows fork requires PyTorch >= 2.4 and CUDA 12)
In the SFTConfig, set dataset_num_proc=1 to avoid a crashing issue:
SFTConfig(
dataset_num_proc=1,
...
)
Advanced/Troubleshooting
For advanced installation instructions or if you see weird errors during installations:
First try using an isolated environment via then pip install unsloth
python -m venv unsloth
source unsloth/bin/activate
pip install unsloth
Install torch and triton. Go to https://pytorch.org to install it. For example pip install torch torchvision torchaudio triton
Confirm if CUDA is installed correctly. Try nvcc. If that fails, you need to install cudatoolkit or CUDA drivers.
Install xformers manually via:
pip install ninja
pip install -v --no-build-isolation -U git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers.git@main#egg=xformers
Check if `xformers` succeeded with `python -m xformers.info` Go to https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers. Another option is to install `flash-attn` for Ampere GPUs and ignore `xformers`
For GRPO runs, you can try installing vllm and seeing if pip install vllm succeeds.
Double check that your versions of Python, CUDA, CUDNN, torch, triton, and xformers are compatible with one another. The PyTorch Compatibility Matrix may be useful.
Finally, install bitsandbytes and check it with python -m bitsandbytes
Conda Installation (Optional)
⚠️Only use Conda if you have it. If not, use Pip. Select either pytorch-cuda=11.8,12.1 for CUDA 11.8 or CUDA 12.1. We support python=3.10,3.11,3.12.
conda create --name unsloth_env \
python=3.11 \
pytorch-cuda=12.1 \
pytorch cudatoolkit xformers -c pytorch -c nvidia -c xformers \
-y
conda activate unsloth_env
pip install unsloth
If you're looking to install Conda in a Linux environment, read here, or run the below 🔽
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
Advanced Pip Installation
⚠️Do **NOT** use this if you have Conda. Pip is a bit more complex since there are dependency issues. The pip command is different for torch 2.2,2.3,2.4,2.5 and CUDA versions.
For other torch versions, we support torch211, torch212, torch220, torch230, torch240 and for CUDA versions, we support cu118 and cu121 and cu124. For Ampere devices (A100, H100, RTX3090) and above, use cu118-ampere or cu121-ampere or cu124-ampere.
For example, if you have torch 2.4 and CUDA 12.1, use:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
Another example, if you have torch 2.5 and CUDA 12.4, use:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "unsloth[cu124-torch250] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
And other examples:
pip install "unsloth[cu121-ampere-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu118-ampere-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu118-torch240] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch230] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu121-ampere-torch230] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch250] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
pip install "unsloth[cu124-ampere-torch250] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
Or, run the below in a terminal to get the optimal pip installation command:
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unslothai/unsloth/main/unsloth/_auto_install.py | python -
Or, run the below manually in a Python REPL:
try: import torch
except: raise ImportError('Install torch via `pip install torch`')
from packaging.version import Version as V
import re
v = V(re.match(r"[0-9\.]{3,}", torch.__version__).group(0))

else: raise RuntimeError(f"Torch = {v} too new!")
if v > V('2.6.9') and cuda not in ("11.8", "12.6", "12.8"): raise RuntimeError(f"CUDA = {cuda} not supported!")
x = x.format(cuda.replace(".", ""), "-ampere" if is_ampere else "")
print(f'pip install --upgrade pip && pip install "unsloth[{x}] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"')

🥇 Performance Benchmarking
For our most detailed benchmarks, read our Llama 3.3 Blog.
Benchmarking of Unsloth was also conducted by 🤗Hugging Face.
We tested using the Alpaca
Dataset, a batch size of 2, gradient accumulation steps of 4, rank = 32, and applied QLoRA on all linear layers (q, k, v, o, gate, up, down):
