Hi 👋, I'm (kiliczsh)
Software Carpenter
📝 I write about tech and thoughts on my blog

🌱 About Me
👋 Hi, I’m Kılıç — a software carpenter, I craft solutions for today and sketch blueprints for tomorrow.
🔧 I build scalable, efficient applications that solve real-world problems — the kind of work that leaves the shop cleaner than I found it.
✨ I believe good code is a joy to read and maintain — like well-done joinery, it holds strong even when no one’s watching.
⚖️ For me, technical excellence means balancing pragmatism with craftsmanship, not over-engineering.
☕ Fuelled by curiosity, clean code, and good coffee.
