kadhirash/README.md
Hello World! üëãüèΩ
My name is Kadhirash Sivakumar and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from University of California, Riverside and am thinking of pursuing a network programming degree from De Anza. I love working on projects and applications where I can see it have a positive impact in people. I am a former Software Engineer Intern at Trelliss, a startup company focused on bettering one's mental health. I am also a content moderator/reviewer for Free Programming Books, one of the TOP ten starred repos out of tens of millions on GitHub!
Blurb about me
üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on doing leetcode problems to better myself for the upcoming technical interviews.
üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about different web frameworks such as Django and ReactJS. I plan to build applications with what I learn, stay tuned!
üí¨ Ask me about my undergraduate research, personal projects, or if you just want to grab virtual coffee ‚òïÔ∏è !
