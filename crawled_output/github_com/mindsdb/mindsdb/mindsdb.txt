MindsDB enables humans, AI, agents, and applications to get highly accurate answers across large scale data sources.
Install MindsDB Server
MindsDB is an open-source server that can be deployed anywhere - from your laptop to the cloud, and everywhere in between. And yes, you can customize it to your heart's content.
Using Docker Desktop. This is the fastest and recommended way to get started and have it all running.
Using Docker. This is also simple, but gives you more flexibility on how to further customize your server.
MindsDB has an MCP server built in that enables your MCP applications to connect, unify and respond to questions over large-scale federated data—spanning databases, data warehouses, and SaaS applications.
Core Philosophy: Connect, Unify, Respond
MindsDB's architecture is built around three fundamental capabilities:
Connect Your Data
You can connect to hundreds of enterprise data sources (learn more). These integrations allow MindsDB to access data wherever it resides, forming the foundation for all other capabilities.
Unify Your Data
In many situations, it’s important to be able to prepare and unify data before generating responses from it. MindsDB SQL offers knowledge bases and views that allow indexing and organizing structured and unstructured data as if it were unified in a single system.
KNOWLEDGE BASES – Index and organize unstructured data for efficient Q&A.
VIEWS – Simplify data access by creating unified views across different sources (no-ETL).
Unification of data can be automated using JOBs
JOBS – Schedule synchronization and transformation tasks for real-time processing.
Respond From Your Data
Chat with Your Data
AGENTS – Configure built-in agents specialized in answering questions over your connected and unified data.
MCP – Connect to MindsDB through the MCP (Model Context Protocol) for seamless interaction.
