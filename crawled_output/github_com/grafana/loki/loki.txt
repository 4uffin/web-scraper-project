Loki: like Prometheus, but for logs.
Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus.
It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate.
It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.
Compared to other log aggregation systems, Loki:
does not do full text indexing on logs. By storing compressed, unstructured logs and only indexing metadata, Loki is simpler to operate and cheaper to run.
indexes and groups log streams using the same labels you’re already using with Prometheus, enabling you to seamlessly switch between metrics and logs using the same labels that you’re already using with Prometheus.
is an especially good fit for storing Kubernetes Pod logs. Metadata such as Pod labels is automatically scraped and indexed.
has native support in Grafana (needs Grafana v6.0).
A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components:
Alloy is agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.
Loki is the main service, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.
Grafana for querying and displaying the logs.
Note that Alloy replaced Promtail in the stack, because Promtail is considered to be feature complete, and future development for logs collection will be in Grafana Alloy.
Loki is like Prometheus, but for logs: we prefer a multidimensional label-based approach to indexing, and want a single-binary, easy to operate system with no dependencies.
Loki differs from Prometheus by focusing on logs instead of metrics, and delivering logs via push, instead of pull.

Promtail is an agent which tails log files and pushes them to Loki.
Pipelines details the log processing pipeline.
Docker Driver Client is a Docker plugin to send logs directly to Loki from Docker containers.
LogCLI provides a command-line interface for querying logs.
Loki Canary monitors your Loki installation for missing logs.
Troubleshooting presents help dealing with error messages.
Loki in Grafana describes how to set up a Loki datasource in Grafana.
Getting Help
If you have any questions or feedback regarding Loki:
Search existing thread in the Grafana Labs community forum for Loki: https://community.grafana.com
Ask a question on the Loki Slack channel. To invite yourself to the Grafana Slack, visit https://slack.grafana.com/ and join the #loki channel.

Building from source
Loki can be run in a single host, no-dependencies mode using the following commands.
You need an up-to-date version of Go, we recommend using the version found in our Makefile
# Checkout source code
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/loki
$ cd loki
# Build binary
$ go build ./cmd/loki
# Run executable
$ ./loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
Alternatively, on Unix systems you can use make to build the binary, which adds additional arguments to the go build command.
# Build binary
$ make loki
# Run executable
$ ./cmd/loki/loki -config.file=./cmd/loki/loki-local-config.yaml
To build Promtail on non-Linux platforms, use the following command:
$ go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
On Linux, Promtail requires the systemd headers to be installed if
Journal support is enabled.
To enable Journal support the go build tag flag promtail_journal_enabled should be passed
With Journal support on Ubuntu, run with the following commands:
$ sudo apt install -y libsystemd-dev
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
With Journal support on CentOS, run with the following commands:
$ sudo yum install -y systemd-devel
$ go build --tags=promtail_journal_enabled ./clients/cmd/promtail
Otherwise, to build Promtail without Journal support, run go build
with CGO disabled:
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./clients/cmd/promtail
