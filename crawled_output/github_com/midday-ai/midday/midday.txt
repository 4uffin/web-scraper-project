Vault: Secure storage for important files like contracts and agreements, keeping everything in one place for easy access​.
Seamless Export: Facilitates easy export of financial data, packaged neatly in CSV files for accountants.
Assistant: Provides tailored insights into financial situations, helping users understand spending patterns, cut costs, and find documents.
