About Me
I am an AI researcher focused on improving human-AI interaction. I've co-led several open-source projects:
AutoGen: A Python framework for building agentic AI systems and multi-agent applications. And AutoGen Studio: An interactive no-code interface for prototyping agents.
Magentic-One: A state-of-the-art multi-agent team for complex tasks built using AutoGen. And Magentic-UI: A human-centered web agent built using AutoGen and Magentic-One.
MarkItDown: A Python tool for converting various files to markdown.
Latest Update
