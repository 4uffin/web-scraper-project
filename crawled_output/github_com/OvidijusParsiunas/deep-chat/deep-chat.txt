üíª Getting started
npm install deep-chat
If using React, install the following instead:
npm install deep-chat-react
Simply add the following to your markup:
<deep-chat></deep-chat>
The exact syntax for the above will vary depending on the framework of your choice (see here).
‚ö° Connect
Connecting to a service is simple, all you need to do is define its API details using the request property:
<deep-chat request='{"url":"https://service.com/chat"}'/>
The service will need to be able to handle request and response formats used in Deep Chat. Please read the Connect section in documentation and check out the server template examples.
Alternatively, if you want to connect without changing the target service, use the interceptor properties to augment the transferred objects or the handler function to control the request code.
üîå Direct connection
Connect to popular AI APIs directly from the browser via the use of the directConnection property:
<deep-chat directConnection='{"openAI":true}'/>
<deep-chat directConnection='{"openAI":{"key": "optional-key-here"}}'/>
Please note that this approach should be used for local/prototyping/demo purposes ONLY as it exposes the API Key to the browser. When ready to go live, please switch to using the connect property described above along with a proxy service.
Currently supported direct API connections:
OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere, Stability AI, Azure, AssemblyAI
ü§ñ Web model
No servers, no connections, host an LLM model entirely on your browser.
Simply add the deep-chat-web-llm module and define the webModel property:
<deep-chat webModel="true" />
üì∑ üé§ Camera and Microphone
Use Deep Chat to capture photos with your webcam and record audio with the microphone. You can enable this using the camera and microphone properties:
<deep-chat camera="true" microphone="true" ...other properties />
üé§ üîâ Speech
deep-chat-speech-to-text.mp4
Input text with your voice using Speech To Text capabilities and have the responses read out to you with Text To Speech. You can enable this functionality via the speechToText and textToSpeech properties.
<deep-chat speechToText="true" textToSpeech="true" ...other properties />
üî∞ Examples
Check out live codepen examples for your UI framework/library of choice:
