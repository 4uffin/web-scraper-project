📰 Announcing Gin 1.11.0!
Read about the latest features and improvements in Gin 1.11.0 on our official blog.
Gin is a high-performance HTTP web framework written in Go. It provides a Martini-like API but with significantly better performance—up to 40 times faster—thanks to httprouter. Gin is designed for building REST APIs, web applications, and microservices where speed and developer productivity are essential.
Why choose Gin?
Gin combines the simplicity of Express.js-style routing with Go's performance characteristics, making it ideal for:
Building high-throughput REST APIs
Developing microservices that need to handle many concurrent requests
Creating web applications that require fast response times
Prototyping web services quickly with minimal boilerplate
Gin's key features:
Zero allocation router - Extremely memory-efficient routing with no heap allocations
High performance - Benchmarks show superior speed compared to other Go web frameworks
Middleware support - Extensible middleware system for authentication, logging, CORS, etc.
Crash-free - Built-in recovery middleware prevents panics from crashing your server
JSON validation - Automatic request/response JSON binding and validation
Route grouping - Organize related routes and apply common middleware
Error management - Centralized error handling and logging
Built-in rendering - Support for JSON, XML, HTML templates, and more
Extensible - Large ecosystem of community middleware and plugins
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Go version: Gin requires Go version 1.23 or above
Basic Go knowledge: Familiarity with Go syntax and package management is helpful
Installation
With Go's module support, simply import Gin in your code and Go will automatically fetch it during build:
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
Your First Gin Application
Here's a complete example that demonstrates Gin's simplicity:
package main
import (
"net/http"
"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
func main() {
// Create a Gin router with default middleware (logger and recovery)
r := gin.Default()
// Define a simple GET endpoint
r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
// Return JSON response
c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
"message": "pong",
})
})
// Start server on port 8080 (default)
// Server will listen on 0.0.0.0:8080 (localhost:8080 on Windows)
r.Run()
}
Running the application:
Save the code above as main.go
Run the application:
go run main.go
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080/ping
You should see: {"message":"pong"}
What this example demonstrates:
Creating a Gin router with default middleware
Defining HTTP endpoints with simple handler functions
Returning JSON responses
Starting an HTTP server

(1): Total Repetitions achieved in constant time, higher means more confident result
(2): Single Repetition Duration (ns/op), lower is better
(3): Heap Memory (B/op), lower is better
(4): Average Allocations per Repetition (allocs/op), lower is better
