Hey there, I'm Purofle! üëã
You can also call me Êó•ËêΩÊûú (R√¨lu√≤gu«í), which is my Chinese nickname.
It's pronounced / ê…ö‚Åµ¬π lwo‚Åµ¬π kwo¬≤¬π‚Å¥/.
üöÄ Interests & Skills
I'm passionate about a few things:
Mobile Development: Crafting Android applications (Kotlin), with a focus on modern UI/UX like Material You/Material 3.
Projects include proxy tools like MaterialBoxForAndroid.
Cross-Platform Development: Exploring solutions like Kotlin Multiplatform.
Web Technologies: Building server-side applications with Golang and JVM(Kotlin and Java).
Game Development: Tinkering with game ideas.
CyberWoodenFish, a simple "wooden fish" game I built with Unity.
Also developed NMSLauncher, a Material You style Minecraft launcher.
Operating Systems & Infrastructure:
Diving into the internals of Linux and macOS.
Content Creation:
Sharing insights on my blog: blog.archlinux.tech.
Creating videos on Bilibili.
