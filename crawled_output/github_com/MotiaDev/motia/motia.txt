🔥 The Unified Backend Framework That Eliminates Runtime Fragmentation 🔥
APIs, background jobs, workflows, and AI agents in one system. JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more in one codebase.

🎯 What is Motia?
Motia solves backend fragmentation.
Modern software engineering is disjointed – APIs live in one framework, background jobs in another, queues have their own tooling, and AI agents are springing up in yet more isolated runtimes. This fragmentation demands a unified system.
Motia unifies APIs, background jobs, queueing, streaming, states, workflows, AI agents, observability, scaling, and deployment into a single coherent system with shared observability and developer experience. Similar to how React simplified frontend development, where everything is a component, Motia simplifies backend development, where everything is a Step.
Write JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more in the same workflow. What used to take 5 frameworks to build now comes out of the box with Motia.
💻 Remix your own Motia App in Replit
🚀 Quickstart
Get Motia project up and running in under 60 seconds:
1. Bootstrap a New Motia Project
npx motia@latest create
# runs the interactive terminal
Follow the prompts to pick a template, project name, and language.
2. Start the Workbench
Inside your new project folder, launch the dev server:
npx motia dev # ➜ http://localhost:3000
That's it! You have:
✅ REST APIs with validation
✅ Visual debugger & tracing
✅ Multi-language support
✅ Event-driven architecture
✅ Zero configuration
