bagder/README.md
Hi, I'm Daniel!
Open Source supporter and developer since the mid 1990s. My code is almost guaranteed
to run in your devices, in one way or another. I work exclusively on Open Source since many years.
I founded and lead the development of the curl project and I do spurious
contributions in other network related projects like libssh2,
c-ares and trurl.
I have authored the following books: Uncurled, everything curl, HTTP/3 explained and http2 explained.
File issues and pull-requests in any and all of the projects I participate in. Contact me via
email at daniel@haxx.se on
Mastodon or IRC in the
#curl channel on libera.chat.
Everything about me and my projects are also available on my website.
