Hi there 👋
I am Stefano, a passionate AI/NLP/Software Engineer.
I like to contribute to open source and share what I learn.
About Me ✨
💫 Software Engineer with a passion for Language Models, open source and knowledge sharing.
🔍 Previously at 01S, I specialized in information extraction and retrieval from unstructured documents, making valuable information accessible to Italian citizens.
👨‍💻 Now at deepset, I contribute to Haystack, an open-source LLM framework and its ecosystem. I enjoy engaging with the community and sharing what I learn and spend time working on.
In my spare time:
I often take meditative walks 🚶
I dedicate myself to social volunteering ⭐
I listen to music, read, watch movies... 🎨
