Local development
The local development server will run our examples app. The basic example will show any changes you've made to the codebase.
To run the local development server, first clone this repo.
Enable corepack to make sure you have the right version of yarn:
npm i -g corepack
Install dependencies:
yarn
Start the local development server:
yarn dev
Open the example project at localhost:5420.
Tips for AIs
Are you an AI agent? If so, this monorepo has special CONTEXT.md files found throughout the repository that you can use to quickly build context while you work. Use your own tools to find and read these files, or use our helpful context script to locate and log the contents of the most relevant files.
To get started quickly, run:
yarn context
This will find and display the nearest CONTEXT.md file to help you understand the codebase. The context script supports several options:
yarn context - Show path to nearest CONTEXT.md from current directory
yarn context ./foo/bar/baz.ts - Show path to nearest CONTEXT.md for a specific file or directory
yarn context -v or --verbose - Show full content of nearest CONTEXT.md
yarn context -r or --recursive - Find all CONTEXT.md files in the repository
License
The tldraw SDK is provided under the tldraw license.
You can use the tldraw SDK in commercial or non-commercial projects so long as you preserve the "Made with tldraw" watermark on the canvas. To remove the watermark, you can purchase a business license. Visit tldraw.dev to learn more.
