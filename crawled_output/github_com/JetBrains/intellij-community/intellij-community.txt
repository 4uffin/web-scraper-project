IntelliJ Open Source Repository
This repository is the open-source part of the JetBrains IDEs codebase.
It also serves as the basis for IntelliJ Platform development.
These instructions will help you build and run open source parts of IntelliJ Platform / IntelliJ IDEA / PyCharm.
If you are new to the community and would like to contribute code or help others learn, see CONTRIBUTING.md to get started.
The following conventions will be used to refer to directories on your machine:
<USER_HOME> is your OS user's home directory.
<IDEA_HOME> is the root directory for the IntelliJ source code.
Getting the Source Code
This section will guide you through getting the project sources and help avoid common issues in git config and other steps before opening it in the IDE.
Prerequisites
Git installed
~2GB free disk space
Install IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2 or higher.
For Windows set these git config to avoid common issues during cloning:
git config --global core.longpaths true
git config --global core.autocrlf input
Clone Main Repository
IntelliJ open source repository is available from the GitHub repository, which can be cloned or downloaded as a zip file (based on a branch) into <IDEA_HOME>.
The master (default) branch contains the source code which will be used to create the next major version of all JetBrains IDEs.
The branch names and build numbers for older releases of JetBrains IDEs can be found on the
Build Number Ranges page.
You can clone this project directly using IntelliJ IDEA.
Alternatively, follow the steps below in a terminal:
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community.git
cd intellij-community
Tip
For faster download: If the complete repository history isn't needed, create shallow clone
To download only the latest revision of the repository,
add --depth 1 option after clone.
Cloning in IntelliJ IDEA also supports creating shallow clone.
Get Android Modules
IntelliJ IDEA requires additional Android modules from separate Git repositories.
Run the following script from project root <IDEA_HOME> to get the required modules:
Linux/macOS: ./getPlugins.sh
Windows: getPlugins.bat
Important
Always git checkout the intellij-community and android Git repositories to the same branches/tags.
Building IntelliJ IDEA
These instructions will help you build IntelliJ IDEA from source code, which is the basis for IntelliJ Platform development.
IntelliJ IDEA '2023.2' or newer is required.
Opening the IntelliJ IDEA Source Code in the IDE
Using the latest IntelliJ IDEA, click 'File | Open', select the <IDEA_HOME> directory.
If IntelliJ IDEA displays a message about a missing or out-of-date required plugin (e.g. Kotlin),
enable, upgrade, or install that plugin and restart IntelliJ IDEA.
Build Configuration Steps
JDK Setup
Use JetBrains Runtime 21 (without JCEF) to compile
IDE will prompt to download it on the first build
Important
JetBrains Runtime without JCEF is required. If jbr-21 SDK points to JCEF version, change it to the non-JCEF version:
Add idea.is.internal=true to idea.properties and restart the IDE.
Go to 'Project Structure | SDKs'
Click 'Browse' → 'Download...'
Select version 21 and vendor 'JetBrains Runtime'
To confirm if the JDK is correct, navigate to the SDK page with jbr-21 selected. Search for jcef, it should NOT yield a result.
Maven Configuration : If the Maven plugin is disabled, add the path variable "MAVEN_REPOSITORY" pointing to <USER_HOME>/.m2/repository directory.
Memory Settings
Ensure a minimum 8GB RAM on your computer.
With the minimum RAM, disable "Compile independent modules in parallel" in 'Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler'.
With notably higher available RAM, Increase "User-local heap size" to 3000.
Building the IntelliJ IDEA Application from Source
To build IntelliJ IDEA from source, choose 'Build | Build Project' from the main menu.
To build installation packages, run the installers.cmd script in <IDEA_HOME> directory. installers.cmd will work on both Windows and Unix systems.
Options to build installers are passed as system properties to installers.cmd command.
You may find the list of available properties in BuildOptions.kt
Installer build examples:
# Build installers only for current operating system:
./installers.cmd -Dintellij.build.target.os=current
# Build source code _incrementally_ (do not build what was already built before):
./installers.cmd -Dintellij.build.incremental.compilation=true
Tip
The installers.cmd is used to run OpenSourceCommunityInstallersBuildTarget from the command line.
You can also call it directly from IDEA, using run configuration Build IDEA Community Installers (current OS).
Dockerized Build Environment
To build installation packages inside a Docker container with preinstalled dependencies and tools, run the following command in <IDEA_HOME> directory (on Windows, use PowerShell):
docker run --rm -it --user "$(id -u)" --volume "${PWD}:/community" "$(docker build --quiet . --target intellij_idea)"
Note
Please remember to specify the --user "$(id -u)" argument for the container's user to match the host's user.
This prevents issues with permissions for the checked-out repository, the build output, and the mounted Maven cache, if any.
To reuse the existing Maven cache from the host system, add the following option to docker run command:
--volume "$HOME/.m2:/home/ide_builder/.m2"
Running IntelliJ IDEA
To run the IntelliJ IDEA that was built from source, choose 'Run | Run' from the main menu. This will use the preconfigured run configuration IDEA.
To run tests on the build, apply these settings to the 'Run | Edit Configurations... | Templates | JUnit' configuration tab:
Working dir: <IDEA_HOME>/bin
VM options:
-ea
Running IntelliJ IDEA in CI/CD environment
To run tests outside of IntelliJ IDEA, run the tests.cmd command in <IDEA_HOME> directory.tests.cmd can be used in both Windows and Unix systems.
Options to run tests are passed as system properties to tests.cmd command.
You may find the list of available properties in TestingOptions.kt
# Build source code _incrementally_ (do not build what was already built before): `
./tests.cmd -Dintellij.build.incremental.compilation=true
#Run a specific test:
./tests.cmd -Dintellij.build.test.patterns=com.intellij.util.ArrayUtilTest
tests.cmd is used just to run CommunityRunTestsBuildTarget from the command line.
You can also call it directly from IDEA, see run configuration tests in community for an example.
