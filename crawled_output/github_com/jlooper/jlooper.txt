Hi, I'm Jen!
I'm the Director of Developer Relations at Cloudinary
Check out our projects at Cloudinary.com
I'm a 3x Founder:
Founder and CEO - Beanpot Studio
About my GitHub projects:
I've published a textbook for kids in grades 6-8, published by Wiley, entitled Computer Science for Kids. It is aligned to CSTA standards and has a fun, game-driven storyline with bespoke print illustrations. Follow this project here and consider purchasing the book for the cool middle-schooler in your life!
I also published The Illustrated AWS Cloud, a visually-guided story-led approach to learning the fundamentals of Cloud Computing using AWS. Check out its web site here. All the author's proceeds from this book will go to Code To Inspire, a program helping women in Afghanistan learn to code.
I founded Front-End Foxes, Inc., an international nonprofit, in 2018. Find our awesome workshops and community recipe book.
I also manage several GitHub organizations. Check out the Digital Humanities Toolkit here.
Some fun facts:
âœ¨ As Head of Academic Advocacy at AWS, I created, founded, and managed AWS Cloud Clubs, which grew to 53K+ students globally in 32 countries. The Academic Team, which I led, was also responsible for creating curriculum accessible to students interested in upskilling in AWS technologies, including Camps and Learning Capsules, teaching infrastructure and AWS service fundamentals.
âœ¨ I also worked at Microsoft for several years, co-leading the Academic Team in DevRel among other activities. I've also worked in nonprofits, small startups, and medium sized companies.
âœ¨ I've written some amazing curricula while at my time at Microsoft that ranks very high on GitHub and has millions of views. If you'd like to see it as I originally designed it, a fork is here. I also kept copies of the ML, AI, IoT and Data Science curricula which you can find here as well.
âœ¨ I teach occasionally at Boston University's Metropolitan School in the CS department.
âœ¨ I have over 24 years' experience as a web and mobile developer, specializing in creating cross-platform mobile and web apps.
âœ¨ I enjoy using machine learning solutions within a mobile and web context (applied ML).
âœ¨ Mostly these days I build with Vue.js and Astro.
âœ¨ I live in Wellesley, Massachusetts (USA) with my husband and am an empty nester with two adult daughters
