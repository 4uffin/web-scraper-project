Hi there 👋
🔭 I research natural language processing and machine learning. I'm currently looking at:
🔒 LLM security: hazards manifest if we don't treat language models as unreliable and subvertible. Or as demons!
🛡️ Online harms: content safety, misinformation processing, hate speech & abusive language detection. Enumerate risks with Language Model Risk Cards
🏢 I'm principal research scientist at NVIDIA for my day job, principal investigator of Strømberg NLP at ITU Copenhagen by night
🧑‍🎓 I’m still learning sizecoding
🎓 My research papers are on Google Scholar. Ask me about any of them!
🪶 I write NLP, machine learning, and language tech articles on my blog, Inter Human Agreement
