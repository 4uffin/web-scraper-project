Introduction

DeepResearchAgent is a hierarchical multi-agent system designed not only for deep research tasks but also for general-purpose task solving. The framework leverages a top-level planning agent to coordinate multiple specialized lower-level agents, enabling automated task decomposition and efficient execution across diverse and complex domains.
🌐 Check out our interactive website: https://skyworkai.github.io/DeepResearchAgent/ - Explore the architecture, view experiments, and learn more about our research!
Architecture
The system adopts a two-layer structure:
1. Top-Level Planning Agent
Responsible for understanding, decomposing, and planning the overall workflow for a given task.
Breaks down tasks into manageable sub-tasks and assigns them to appropriate lower-level agents.
Dynamically coordinates the collaboration among agents to ensure smooth task completion.
2. Specialized Lower-Level Agents
Deep Analyzer
Performs in-depth analysis of input information, extracting key insights and potential requirements.
Supports analysis of various data types, including text and structured data.
Deep Researcher
Conducts thorough research on specified topics or questions, retrieving and synthesizing high-quality information.
Capable of generating research reports or knowledge summaries automatically.
Browser Use
Automates browser operations, supporting web search, information extraction, and data collection tasks.
Assists the Deep Researcher in acquiring up-to-date information from the internet.
MCP Manager Agent
Manages and orchestrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and services.
Enables dynamic tool discovery, registration, and execution through MCP standards.
Supports both local and remote MCP tool integration for enhanced agent capabilities.
General Tool Calling Agent
Provides a general-purpose interface for invoking various tools and APIs.
Supports function calling, allowing the agent to execute specific tasks or retrieve information from external services.
Features
Hierarchical agent collaboration for complex and dynamic task scenarios
Extensible agent system, allowing easy integration of additional specialized agents
Automated information analysis, research, and web interaction capabilities
Secure Python code execution environment for tools, featuring configurable import controls, restricted built-ins, attribute access limitations, and resource limits. (See PythonInterpreterTool Sandboxing for details).
Support for asynchronous operations, enabling efficient handling of multiple tasks and agents
Support for local and remote model inference, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google LLMs, and local Qwen models via vLLM
Support for image and video generation tools based on the Imagen and Veo3 models, respectively
Image and Video Examples:
Updates
2025.08.04: Add the support for loading mcp tools from the local json file.
2025.07.08: Add the video generator tool, which can generate a video based on the input text and/or image. The video generator tool is based on the Veo3 model.
2025.07.08: Add the image generator tool, which can generate images based on the input text. The image generator tool is based on the Imagen model.
2025.07.07: Due to the limited flexibility of TOML configuration files, we have switched to using the config format supported by mmengine.
2025.06.20: Add the support for the mcp (Both the local mcp and remote mcp).
2025.06.17: Update technical report https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12508.
2025.06.01: Update the browser-use to 0.1.48.
2025.05.30: Convert the sub agent to a function call. Planning agent can now be gpt-4.1 or gemini-2.5-pro.
2025.05.27: Support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google LLMs, and local Qwen models (via vLLM, see details in Usage).

Installation
Prepare Environment
# poetry install environment
conda create -n dra python=3.11
conda activate dra
make install
# (Optional) You can also use requirements.txt
conda create -n dra python=3.11
conda activate dra
make install-requirements
# playwright install if needed
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
Set Up .env
Please refer to the .env.template file and create a .env file in the root directory of the project. This file is used to configure API keys and other environment variables.
Refer to the following instructions to obtain the necessary google gemini-2.5-pro API key and set it in the .env file:
https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials?hl=zh-cn
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
gcloud init
gcloud auth application-default login
Usage
Main Example
A simple example to demonstrate the usage of the DeepResearchAgent framework.
python main.py
Run Single Agent Example
A simple example to demonstrate the usage of a single agent, such as a general tool calling agent.
python examples/run_general.py
RUN GAIA Evaluation Example
# Download GAIA
mkdir data && cd data
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaia-benchmark/GAIA
# Run
python examples/run_gaia.py
Experiments
We evaluated our agent on both GAIA validation and test sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our system demonstrates superior performance across all difficulty levels.
With the integration of the Computer Use and MCP Manager Agent, which now enables pixel-level control of the browser, our system demonstrates remarkable evolutionary capabilities. The agents can dynamically acquire and enhance their abilities through learning and adaptation, leading to significantly improved performance. The latest results show:
Test Set: 83.39 (average), with 93.55 on Level 1, 83.02 on Level 2, and 65.31 on Level 3
Validation Set: 82.4 (average), with 92.5 on Level 1, 83.7 on Level 2, and 57.7 on Level 3
Questions
1. About Qwen Models
Our framework now supports:
qwen2.5-7b-instruct
qwen2.5-14b-instruct
qwen2.5-32b-instruct
Update your config:
model_id = "qwen2.5-7b-instruct"
2. Browser Use
If problems occur, reinstall:
pip install "browser-use[memory]"==0.1.48
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
3. Sub-Agent Calling
Function-calling is now supported natively by GPT-4.1 / Gemini 2.5 Pro. Claude-3.7-Sonnet is also recommended.
4. Use vllm for local models
We provide huggingface as a shortcut to the local model. Also provide vllm as a way to start services so that parallel acceleration can be provided.
Step 1: Launch the vLLM Inference Service
nohup bash -c 'CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
--model /input0/Qwen3-32B \
--served-model-name Qwen \
--host 0.0.0.0 \
--port 8000 \
--max-num-seqs 16 \
--enable-auto-tool-choice \
--tool-call-parser hermes \
--tensor_parallel_size 2' > vllm_qwen.log 2>&1 &
Update .env:
QWEN_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000/v1
QWEN_API_KEY="abc"
Step 2: Launch the Agent Service
python main.py
Example command:
Use deep_researcher_agent to search the latest papers on the topic of 'AI Agent' and then summarize it.
Acknowledgement
DeepResearchAgent is primarily inspired by the architecture of smolagents. The following improvements have been made:
The codebase of smolagents has been modularized for better structure and organization.
The original synchronous framework has been refactored into an asynchronous one.
The multi-agent setup process has been optimized to make it more user-friendly and efficient.
We would like to express our gratitude to the following open source projects, which have greatly contributed to the development of this work:
smolagents - A lightweight agent framework.
OpenManus - An asynchronous agent framework.
browser-use - An AI-powered browser automation tool.
crawl4ai - A web crawling library for AI applications.
markitdown - A tool for converting files to Markdown format.
We sincerely appreciate the efforts of all contributors and maintainers of these projects for their commitment to advancing AI technologies and making them available to the wider community.
