No complex integrations or APIs required.Built on GitHub, ready to scaleLeverage all the powerful GitHub tools for version control, security, collaboration, and deployment—so you can scale as you grow from prototype to production.Try GitHub Spark“We use Spark to rapidly test LLM flows and build internal tooling. Now we literally get a functioning prototype by just typing out ideas in seconds. While there are other tools that turn natural language into functioning UI, Spark actually builds entire (mini) applications with LLM backends that are fully functional, not just the frontend UI.Anand ChowdharyCo-founder, CTO, CPO at FirstQuadrantWhat will you build?Whether you're creating personal tools, prototypes, or the next big SaaS, Spark brings all kinds of ideas to life.PrototypingStop explaining your idea—show it. Create functional prototypes in minutes, share for feedback, iterate instantly.Personal appsGo beyond generic. Build exactly what you want—whether it's AI-powered workout trackers, meal planners, habit builders, or anything else.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, Spark lets you create full-stack applications with built-in AI, using natural language, visual tools, or code.With instant previews, one-click deployment, and deep integration with GitHub’s trusted ecosystem, Spark helps you go from idea to production—fast. And because it’s built on the tools 150 million developers already rely on, your apps are ready to scale from day one.
How does it work?Spark makes intelligent application development more accessible, adaptable, and secure by blending powerful AI capabilities with hands-on flexibility, code-level control, and GitHub's complete platform—empowering everyone to go from idea to production faster, all in one place. It’s built for modern web development, supporting TypeScript and React. Everything runs and deploys on an integrated runtime environment with strong defaults designed to help you move fast, stay focused, and scale with confidence.What can I build with Spark?From AI-powered tools to personal side projects, Spark helps you build real, functional apps—fast.Use it to prototype features, test ideas with real users, or launch open source projects. Turn spreadsheets into interactive apps, build internal tools, or create smart helpers for everyday life—like a recipe planner that remembers dietary needs or a restaurant finder that adapts to your tastes.Whether you're building for your team, your community, or just yourself, Spark gives you the power to create intelligent apps—no code required (unless you want to).
Do I need to know how to code to use Spark?No coding experience? No problem. Spark is built for people with all levels of technical fluency. You can describe what you want to build in plain language, and Spark handles the heavy lifting.If you have a development background, you can go deeper: edit code directly in the Spark editor, open your app in Codespaces//VS Code, and use GitHub Copilot and the coding agent to build with full control and flexibility.
What’s included?Spark gives you everything you need to build and deploy full-stack AI apps—right out-of-the-box.Depending on your GitHub Copilot plan, you’ll get a monthly amount of Spark messages, unlimited manual editing, and the ability to build multiple apps simultaneously. You’ll also receive app hosting, compute, AI inference, and storage as part of the integrated runtime of Spark. Additional pay-as-you-go options for usage beyond these included amounts coming soon.What is a Spark message?A Spark message is any prompt you send to Spark to generate or modify your app using natural language. This includes inputs in the Iterate panel or when using targeted editing to adjust specific parts of your app.Each message helps Spark understand your intent—whether you're adding a feature, refining design, or updating functionality.
Pricing & AccessHow much does Spark cost?Spark is currently included in Copilot Pro+ plans, with plans to expand to additional plans coming soon. Spark draws on your Copilot Pro+ plan’s premium request allowance.

An AI agent generates a working app—frontend, backend, AI features, and database connections (as needed) included.Iterate your way - Refine your app using natural language, visual controls, or dive into code with Copilot completions in the Spark editor. See changes instantly in the live preview.Go live with a click - When you're satisfied, publish with a click. Your app launches with secure hosting, built-in GitHub user authentication, and the infrastructure needed to handle real users, no configuration required.How do I deploy my Spark apps?Deployment is seamless.
