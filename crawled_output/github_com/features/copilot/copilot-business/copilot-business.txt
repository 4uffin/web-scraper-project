GitHub Copilot functionality works in code editors regardless of code hosting platform. Some features are enhanced with the use of GitHub because Copilot can directly draw context and knowledge from repositories, pull requests, issues, and other data structures in the GitHub platform.
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.
Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations. With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a Data Protection Agreement that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.
