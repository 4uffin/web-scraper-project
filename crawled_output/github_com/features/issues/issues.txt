“The new planning and tracking functionality keeps my project management close to my code. I no longer find myself needing to reach for spreadsheets or 3P tools which go stale instantly.Dan GodfreyDevelopment ManagerFlexible project planning for developers Start using projectsContact salesFrequently asked questionsWhat is GitHub Issues?We all need a way to plan our work, track issues, and discuss the things we build. Our answer to this universal question is GitHub Issues, and it’s built-in to every repository. GitHub’s issue tracking is unique because of our focus on simplicity, references, and elegant formatting.With GitHub Issues, you can express ideas with GitHub Flavored Markdown, assign and mention contributors, react with emojis, clarify with attachments and videos, plus reference code like commits, pull requests, and deploys. With task lists, you can break big issues into tasks, further organize your work with milestones and labels, and track relationships and dependencies.We built GitHub Issues for developers. It is simple, adaptable, and powerful.What are Projects?As teams and projects grow, how we work evolves. Tools that hard-code a methodology are too specific and rigid to adapt to any moment. Often, we find ourselves creating a spreadsheet or pulling out a notepad to have the space to think. Then our planning is disconnected from where the work happens.The new Projects connect your planning directly to the work your teams are doing and flexibly adapt to whatever your team needs at any point. Built like a spreadsheet, project tables give you a live canvas to filter, sort, and group issues and pull requests. You can use it, or the accompanying project board, along with custom fields, to track a sprint, plan a feature, or manage a large-scale release.What plans have access to Projects?All users have access to the free tier of GitHub Issues and Projects. For more information about paid tiers, see our pricing page.Will the new Projects experience be available in GitHub Enterprise Server?Yes! GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support follows our regular cadence of one to two quarters before enabling the on-premises functionality.
