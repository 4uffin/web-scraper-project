View GitHub Models documentationLearn about billing on GitHubIf you want to use GitHub Models beyond the free usage included in your account, you can choose to opt-in to paid usage.Learn about billing for GitHub ModelsExplore modelsBrowse and try out different models from top providers.Discover modelsFrequently asked questionsWhat is GitHub Models? GitHub Models brings AI directly into the developer workflow by providing access to multiple leading models through a single API key. It allows teams to manage prompts as code, run side-by-side model evaluations, and move from testing to production within the same environment they already use.
Is GitHub Models different from GitHub Copilot?Yes, GitHub Models is a separate product, outside of GitHub Copilot. GitHub Models is free for everyone to get started building AI with and can be leveraged directly within GitHub. What is the Models playground?GitHub Models includes a playground where you can explore a curated selection of AI models from providers like OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft. There you can experiment with prompts, tweak parameters (such as temperature or max tokens), and see how different models respond, all in real time.Can I bring my own model key?Yes, you can bring your own API keys (BYOK) from different providers, such as OpenAI or Azure AI. Model inference runs directly through your provider, and usage is billed and tracked through your provider account. View the GitHub BYOK documentation.How does GitHub Models billing work on GitHub?Billing for GitHub Models is designed to be flexible and to allow you to use your preferred model providers, while also providing the ability to control your spending. Model usage is powered by the Azure OpenAI Service and billed through GitHub using the same global pay-as-you-go pricing as Azure OpenAI Service. Learn more about billing for GitHub Models.
