This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.
The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.
This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.
This system employs several agents working together:
Aswath Damodaran Agent - The Dean of Valuation, focuses on story, numbers, and disciplined valuation
Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change
Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
Michael Burry Agent - The Big Short contrarian who hunts for deep value
Mohnish Pabrai Agent - The Dhandho investor, who looks for doubles at low risk
Peter Lynch Agent - Practical investor who seeks "ten-baggers" in everyday businesses
Phil Fisher Agent - Meticulous growth investor who uses deep "scuttlebutt" research
Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Agent - The Big Bull of India
Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders
Note: the system does not actually make any trades.

How to Install
Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you'll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
2. Set up API keys
Create a .env file for your API keys:
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
Open and edit the .env file to add your API keys:
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
Important: You must set at least one LLM API key (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, or DEEPSEEK_API_KEY) for the hedge fund to work.
Financial Data: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY in the .env file.
How to Run
‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface
You can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.
Quick Start
Install Poetry (if not already installed):
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
Install dependencies:
poetry install
Run the AI Hedge Fund
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
You can also specify a --ollama flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions over a specific time period.
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
Run the Backtester
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
Example Output:
Note: The --ollama, --start-date, and --end-date flags work for the backtester, as well!
üñ•Ô∏è Web Application
The new way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. This is recommended for users who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.
Please see detailed instructions on how to install and run the web application here.
