Featured Models
The Models team is focused on developing the following models to a customer-ready state. Ongoing work includes optimizations for performance, accuracy, and compatibility. Follow each model link for more details.
ImportantFor a full model list see the Model Matrix, or visit the Developer Hub.
NotePerformance Metrics:
Time to First Token (TTFT) measures the time (in milliseconds) it takes to generate the first output token after input is received.
T/S/U (Tokens per Second per User): Represents the throughput of first-token generation after prefill. It is calculated as 1 / inter-token latency.
T/S (Tokens per Second): Represents total token throughput, calculated as T/S = T/S/U x batch size.
TP (Tensor Parallel) and DP (Data Parallel): Indicate the parallelization factors across multiple devices.
Reported LLM Performance: Based on an input sequence length of 128 tokens for all models.
Performance Data Source: Metrics were collected using the tt-metal model demos (linked above). Results may vary when using other runtimes such as the vLLM inference server.
