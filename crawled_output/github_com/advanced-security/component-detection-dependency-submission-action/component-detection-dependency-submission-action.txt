This GitHub Action runs the microsoft/component-detection library to automate dependency extraction at build time. It uses a combination of static and dynamic scanning to build a dependency tree and then uploads that to GitHub's dependency graph via the dependency submission API. This gives you more accurate Dependabot alerts, and support for a bunch of additional ecosystems.
