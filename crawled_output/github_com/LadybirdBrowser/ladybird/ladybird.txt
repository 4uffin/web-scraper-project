Ladybird is a truly independent web browser, using a novel engine based on web standards.
ImportantLadybird is in a pre-alpha state, and only suitable for use by developers
Features
We aim to build a complete, usable browser for the modern web.
Ladybird uses a multi-process architecture with a main UI process, several WebContent renderer processes,
an ImageDecoder process, and a RequestServer process.
Image decoding and network connections are done out of process to be more robust against malicious content.
Each tab has its own renderer process, which is sandboxed from the rest of the system.
At the moment, many core library support components are inherited from SerenityOS:
LibWeb: Web rendering engine
LibJS: JavaScript engine
LibWasm: WebAssembly implementation
LibCrypto/LibTLS: Cryptography primitives and Transport Layer Security
LibHTTP: HTTP/1.1 client
LibGfx: 2D Graphics Library, Image Decoding and Rendering
LibUnicode: Unicode and locale support
LibMedia: Audio and video playback
LibCore: Event loop, OS abstraction layer
LibIPC: Inter-process communication
How do I build and run this?
See build instructions for information on how to build Ladybird.
Ladybird runs on Linux, macOS, Windows (with WSL2), and many other *Nixes.
How do I read the documentation?
Code-related documentation can be found in the documentation folder.
