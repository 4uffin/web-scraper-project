davorpa/README.md
Hello, Human ! 👋
Here is David, a passionate about programming and coding with headquarters in Spain. He has technical skills in frontend and backend. It's a bit difficult task to him deciding which one of both sides is his favorite!
With strong logical skills on programming languages like Java and Javascript, he is currently focusing on clean code, software patterns as well as continuing to delve into algorithms, new paradigms... Handle languages such as Python and Go are now his target. Privacy, web accessibility (WCAG - WAI-ARIA), and software authorship attribution are also areas of interest.
An open-source enthusiast / mantainer: collaborate in FOOS projects improves learning a lot. He loves how knowledge sharing and collaboration flows through open-source.
It'd be a pleasure to give back the solid knowledges on these topics with the great developers community we are. Therefore, don't be afraid to ask something about.
Learn. Code. Enjoy. Repeat ♻️🚀
Be passionate
Open-minded 😉, PRs / improvements always welcome 🤗.
