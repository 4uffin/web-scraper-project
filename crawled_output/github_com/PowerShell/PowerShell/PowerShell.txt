Welcome to the PowerShell GitHub Community!
PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized
for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models.
It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language, and a framework for processing cmdlets.
Windows PowerShell vs. PowerShell 7+
Although this repository started as a fork of the Windows PowerShell codebase, changes made in this repository are not ported back to Windows PowerShell 5.1.
This also means that issues tracked here are only for PowerShell 7.x and higher.
Windows PowerShell specific issues should be reported with the Feedback Hub app, by choosing "Apps > PowerShell" in the category.
New to PowerShell?
If you are new to PowerShell and want to learn more, we recommend reviewing the getting started documentation.
Get PowerShell
PowerShell is supported on Windows, macOS, and a variety of Linux platforms. For
more information, see Installing PowerShell.
Upgrading PowerShell
For best results when upgrading, you should use the same install method you used when you first
installed PowerShell. The update method is different for each platform and install method.
Community Dashboard
Dashboard with visualizations for community contributions and project status using PowerShell, Azure, and PowerBI.
For more information on how and why we built this dashboard, check out this blog post.
Discussions
GitHub Discussions is a feature to enable free and open discussions within the community
for topics that are not related to code, unlike issues.
This is an experiment we are trying in our repositories, to see if it helps move discussions out of issues so that issues remain actionable by the team or members of the community.
There should be no expectation that PowerShell team members are regular participants in these discussions.
Individual PowerShell team members may choose to participate in discussions, but the expectation is that community members help drive discussions so that team members
can focus on issues.
Create or join a discussion.
