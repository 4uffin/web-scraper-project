Simplifying Vision AI for Devs, Startups, and Enterprises
Hi, I‚Äôm Muhammad Rizwan Munawar, proud to be ranked among the top 5 contributors to the Ultralytics repository, where I design and build real-time AI systems for object detection, segmentation, tracking, and pose estimation. I created Ultralytics Solutions, a modular toolkit solving real-world computer vision problems, from smart surveillance to industrial automation.
With 50K+ LinkedIn followers and over 15M impressions in the past year, I share open-source tools, tutorials, and research-driven insights to empower developers, startups, and enterprises building the next generation of Vision AI products.
