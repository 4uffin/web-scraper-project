A web interface for Stable Diffusion, implemented using Gradio library.
Features
Detailed feature showcase with images:
Original txt2img and img2img modes
One click install and run script (but you still must install python and git)
Outpainting
Inpainting
Color Sketch
Prompt Matrix
Stable Diffusion Upscale
Attention, specify parts of text that the model should pay more attention to
a man in a ((tuxedo)) - will pay more attention to tuxedo
a man in a (tuxedo:1.21) - alternative syntax
select text and press Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down (or Command+Up or Command+Down if you're on a MacOS) to automatically adjust attention to selected text (code contributed by anonymous user)
Loopback, run img2img processing multiple times
X/Y/Z plot, a way to draw a 3 dimensional plot of images with different parameters
Textual Inversion
have as many embeddings as you want and use any names you like for them
use multiple embeddings with different numbers of vectors per token
works with half precision floating point numbers
train embeddings on 8GB (also reports of 6GB working)
Extras tab with:
GFPGAN, neural network that fixes faces
CodeFormer, face restoration tool as an alternative to GFPGAN
RealESRGAN, neural network upscaler
ESRGAN, neural network upscaler with a lot of third party models
SwinIR and Swin2SR (see here), neural network upscalers
LDSR, Latent diffusion super resolution upscaling
Resizing aspect ratio options
Sampling method selection
Adjust sampler eta values (noise multiplier)
More advanced noise setting options
Interrupt processing at any time
4GB video card support (also reports of 2GB working)
Correct seeds for batches
Live prompt token length validation
Generation parameters
parameters you used to generate images are saved with that image
in PNG chunks for PNG, in EXIF for JPEG
can drag the image to PNG info tab to restore generation parameters and automatically copy them into UI
can be disabled in settings
drag and drop an image/text-parameters to promptbox
Read Generation Parameters Button, loads parameters in promptbox to UI
Settings page
Running arbitrary python code from UI (must run with --allow-code to enable)
Mouseover hints for most UI elements
Possible to change defaults/mix/max/step values for UI elements via text config
Tiling support, a checkbox to create images that can be tiled like textures
Progress bar and live image generation preview
Can use a separate neural network to produce previews with almost none VRAM or compute requirement
Negative prompt, an extra text field that allows you to list what you don't want to see in generated image
Styles, a way to save part of prompt and easily apply them via dropdown later
Variations, a way to generate same image but with tiny differences
Seed resizing, a way to generate same image but at slightly different resolution
CLIP interrogator, a button that tries to guess prompt from an image
Prompt Editing, a way to change prompt mid-generation, say to start making a watermelon and switch to anime girl midway
Batch Processing, process a group of files using img2img
Img2img Alternative, reverse Euler method of cross attention control
Highres Fix, a convenience option to produce high resolution pictures in one click without usual distortions
Reloading checkpoints on the fly
Checkpoint Merger, a tab that allows you to merge up to 3 checkpoints into one
Custom scripts with many extensions from community
Composable-Diffusion, a way to use multiple prompts at once
separate prompts using uppercase AND
also supports weights for prompts: a cat :1.2 AND a dog AND a penguin :2.2
No token limit for prompts (original stable diffusion lets you use up to 75 tokens)
DeepDanbooru integration, creates danbooru style tags for anime prompts
xformers, major speed increase for select cards: (add --xformers to commandline args)
via extension: History tab: view, direct and delete images conveniently within the UI
Generate forever option
Training tab
hypernetworks and embeddings options
Preprocessing images: cropping, mirroring, autotagging using BLIP or deepdanbooru (for anime)
Clip skip
Hypernetworks
Loras (same as Hypernetworks but more pretty)
A separate UI where you can choose, with preview, which embeddings, hypernetworks or Loras to add to your prompt
Can select to load a different VAE from settings screen
Estimated completion time in progress bar
API
Support for dedicated inpainting model by RunwayML
via extension: Aesthetic Gradients, a way to generate images with a specific aesthetic by using clip images embeds (implementation of https://github.com/vicgalle/stable-diffusion-aesthetic-gradients)
Stable Diffusion 2.0 support - see wiki for instructions
Alt-Diffusion support - see wiki for instructions
Now without any bad letters!
Load checkpoints in safetensors format
Eased resolution restriction: generated image's dimensions must be a multiple of 8 rather than 64
Now with a license!
Reorder elements in the UI from settings screen
Segmind Stable Diffusion support
Installation and Running
Make sure the required dependencies are met and follow the instructions available for:
NVidia (recommended)
AMD GPUs.
Intel CPUs, Intel GPUs (both integrated and discrete) (external wiki page)
Ascend NPUs (external wiki page)
Alternatively, use online services (like Google Colab):
List of Online Services
Installation on Windows 10/11 with NVidia-GPUs using release package
Download sd.webui.zip from v1.0.0-pre and extract its contents.
Run update.bat.
Run run.bat.
For more details see Install-and-Run-on-NVidia-GPUs
Automatic Installation on Windows
Install Python 3.10.6 (Newer version of Python does not support torch), checking "Add Python to PATH".
Install git.
Download the stable-diffusion-webui repository, for example by running git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git.
Run webui-user.bat from Windows Explorer as normal, non-administrator, user.
Automatic Installation on Linux
Install the dependencies:
# Debian-based:
sudo apt install wget git python3 python3-venv libgl1 libglib2.0-0
# Red Hat-based:
sudo dnf install wget git python3 gperftools-libs libglvnd-glx
# openSUSE-based:
sudo zypper install wget git python3 libtcmalloc4 libglvnd
# Arch-based:
sudo pacman -S wget git python3
If your system is very new, you need to install python3.11 or python3.10:
# Ubuntu 24.04
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11
# Manjaro/Arch
sudo pacman -S yay
yay -S python311 # do not confuse with python3.11 package
# Only for 3.11
# Then set up env variable in launch script
export python_cmd="python3.11"
# or in webui-user.sh
python_cmd="python3.11"
Navigate to the directory you would like the webui to be installed and execute the following command:
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/master/webui.sh
Or just clone the repo wherever you want:
git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
Run webui.sh.
Check webui-user.sh for options.
