Build engaging AI avatars with TEN Agent using Trulience's diverse collection of free avatar options. To get it up and running, you only need 2 steps:
Follow the README to finish setting up and running the Playground
Enter the avatar ID and token you get from Trulience
2️⃣ Real-time voice with MCP servers
TEN Agent now integrates seamlessly with MCP servers, expanding its LLM capabilities. To get started:
Open the Module Picker in Playground
Add the MCP server tool for LLM integration
Paste a URL from your MCP server in the extension
Start a realtime conversation with TEN Agent
This integration allows you to leverage MCP's diverse servers offerings while maintaining TEN Agent's powerful conversational abilities.

3️⃣ Real-time communication with hardware
TEN Agent is now running on the Espressif ESP32-S3 Korvo V3 development board, an excellent way to integrate realtime communication with LLM on hardware.
Check out the integration guide for more details.
4️⃣ Real-time vision and real-time screenshare detection
Try Google Gemini Multimodal Live API with realtime vision and realtime screenshare detection capabilities, it is a ready-to-use extension, along with powerful tools like Weather Check and Web Search integrated perfectly into TEN Agent.
5️⃣ TEN with other LLM platforms

6️⃣ StoryTeller - TEN image generation
Experience the real-time image generation with StoryTeller, it is a ready-to-use extension, along with powerful tools like Weather Check and Web Search integrated perfectly into TEN.
👩‍💻 Get TEN Agent up and running
🅰️ Run TEN Agent in localhost
Step ⓵ - Prerequisites
Category
Requirements
Keys
• Agora App ID and App Certificate (free minutes every month) • OpenAI API key (any LLM that is compatible with OpenAI)• Deepgram ASR (free credits available with signup)• Elevenlabs TTS (free credits available with signup)
Installation
• Docker / Docker Compose• Node.js(LTS) v18
Minimum System Requirements
• CPU >= 2 Core• RAM >= 4 GB
Note
macOS: Docker setting on Apple Silicon
Uncheck "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation" in Docker settings, it may result in slower build times on ARM, but performance will be normal when deployed to x64 servers.
Step ⓶ - Build agent in VM
1. Clone down the repo,cd to ai-agents and create .env file from .env.example
cd ai_agents
cp ./.env.example ./.env
2. Setup Agora App ID and App Certificate in .env
AGORA_APP_ID=
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=
3. Start agent development containers
docker compose up -d
4. Enter container
docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash
5. Build agent with the default graph ( ~5min - ~8min)
check the /examples folder for more examples
# use the chained voice assistant
task use AGENT=voice-assistant
# or use the speech-to-speech voice assistant realtime
task use AGENT=voice-assistant-realtime
6. Start the web server
# run task build if you changed any local source code, this is necessary if you are working on languages which require compilation like TypeScript or Golang.
task build
task run
Step ⓷ - Customize your agent with TMAN Designer
Open localhost:49483.
Right-click on the STT, LLM, and TTS extensions.
Open their properties and enter APIs respectively.
Right-click the canvas and select 'Manage Apps' to open the Apps Manager.
Right under the Actions, click the ▶ to run the App.
Check the 'Run with TEN Agent' option and click the Run button.
🅱️ Run TEN Agent in Codespace(no docker)
GitHub offers free Codespace for each repository, you can run the playground in Codespace without using Docker.Also, the speed of Codespace is much faster than localhost.
Check out this guide for more details.
🛳️ TEN Agent Self Hosting
🅰️ Deploying with Docker
Once you have customized your agent (either by using the TMAN Manager, Playground, or editing property.json directly), you can deploy it by creating a release Docker image for your service.
Read the Deployment Guide for detailed information about deployment.
🅱️ Deploying with other cloud services
