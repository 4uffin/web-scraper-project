🎯 What is ROMA?
ROMA is a meta-agent framework that uses recursive hierarchical structures to solve complex problems. By breaking down tasks into parallelizable components, ROMA enables agents to tackle sophisticated reasoning challenges while maintaining transparency that makes context-engineering and iteration straightforward. The framework offers parallel problem solving where agents work simultaneously on different parts of complex tasks, transparent development with a clear structure for easy debugging, and proven performance demonstrated through our search agent's strong benchmark results. We've shown the framework's effectiveness, but this is just the beginning. As an open-source and extensible platform, ROMA is designed for community-driven development, allowing you to build and customize agents for your specific needs while benefiting from the collective improvements of the community.
🏗️ How It Works
ROMA framework processes tasks through a recursive plan–execute loop:
def solve(task):
if is_atomic(task):
# Step 1: Atomizer
return execute(task)
# Step 2: Executor
else:
subtasks = plan(task)
# Step 2: Planner
results = []
for subtask in subtasks:
results.append(solve(subtask))
# Recursive call
return aggregate(results)
# Step 3: Aggregator
# Entry point:
answer = solve(initial_request)
Atomizer – Decides whether a request is atomic (directly executable) or requires planning.
Planner – If planning is needed, the task is broken into smaller subtasks. Each subtask is fed back into the Atomizer, making the process recursive.
Executors – Handle atomic tasks. Executors can be LLMs, APIs, or even other agents — as long as they implement an agent.execute() interface.
Aggregator – Collects and integrates results from subtasks. Importantly, the Aggregator produces the answer to the original parent task, not just raw child outputs.
📐 Information Flow
Top-down: Tasks are decomposed into subtasks recursively.
Bottom-up: Subtask results are aggregated upwards into solutions for parent tasks.
Left-to-right: If a subtask depends on the output of a previous one, it waits until that subtask completes before execution.
This structure makes the system flexible, recursive, and dependency-aware — capable of decomposing complex problems into smaller steps while ensuring results are integrated coherently.

Loading
🚀 30-Second Quick Start
git clone https://github.com/sentient-agi/ROMA.git
cd ROMA
# Run the automated setup
./setup.sh
Choose between:
Docker Setup (Recommended) - One-command setup with isolation
Native Setup - Direct installation for development
🛠️ Technical Stack
Framework: Built on AgnoAgents
Backend: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI/Flask
Frontend: React + TypeScript with real-time WebSocket
LLM Support: Any provider via LiteLLM
Data Persistence: Enterprise S3 mounting with security validation
🔒 goofys FUSE mounting for zero-latency file access
🛡️ Path injection protection with comprehensive validation
🔐 AWS credentials verification before operations
📁 Dynamic Docker Compose with secure volume mounting
Code Execution: E2B sandboxes with unified S3 integration
Security: Production-grade validation and error handling
Features: Multi-modal, tools, MCP, hooks, caching
📦 Installation Options
Quick Start (Recommended)
# Main setup (choose Docker or Native)
./setup.sh
# Optional: Setup E2B sandbox integration
./setup.sh --e2b
# Test E2B integration
./setup.sh --test-e2b
Command Line Options
./setup.sh --docker
# Run Docker setup directly
./setup.sh --docker-from-scratch
# Rebuild Docker images/containers from scratch (down -v, no cache)
./setup.sh --native
# Run native setup directly (macOS/Ubuntu/Debian)
./setup.sh --e2b
# Setup E2B template (requires E2B_API_KEY + AWS creds)
./setup.sh --test-e2b
# Test E2B template integration
./setup.sh --help
# Show all available options
Manual Installation
See setup docs for detailed instructions.
🏗️ Optional: E2B Sandbox Integration
For secure code execution capabilities, optionally set up E2B sandboxes:
# After main setup, configure E2B (requires E2B_API_KEY and AWS credentials in .env)
./setup.sh --e2b
# Test E2B integration
./setup.sh --test-e2b
E2B Features:
🔒 Secure Code Execution - Run untrusted code in isolated sandboxes
☁️ S3 Integration - Automatic data sync between local and sandbox environments
🚀 goofys Mounting - High-performance S3 filesystem mounting
🔧 AWS Credentials - Passed securely via Docker build arguments
🤖 Pre-built Agents
Note: These agents are demonstrations built using ROMA's framework through simple vibe-prompting and minimal manual tuning. They showcase how easily you can create high-performance agents with ROMA, rather than being production-final solutions. Our mission is to empower the community to build, share, and get rewarded for creating innovative agent recipes and use-cases.
ROMA comes with example agents that demonstrate the framework's capabilities:
🔍 General Task Solver
A versatile agent powered by ChatGPT Search Preview for handling diverse tasks:
Intelligent Search: Leverages OpenAI's latest search capabilities for real-time information
Flexible Planning: Adapts task decomposition based on query complexity
Multi-Domain: Handles everything from technical questions to creative projects
Quick Prototyping: Perfect for testing ROMA's capabilities without domain-specific setup
Perfect for: General research, fact-checking, exploratory analysis, quick information gathering
🔬 Deep Research Agent
A comprehensive research system that breaks down complex research questions into manageable sub-tasks:
Smart Task Decomposition: Automatically splits research topics into search, analysis, and synthesis phases
Parallel Information Gathering: Executes multiple searches simultaneously for faster results
Multi-Source Integration: Combines results from web search, Wikipedia, and specialized APIs
Intelligent Synthesis: Aggregates findings into coherent, well-structured reports
Perfect for: Academic research, market analysis, competitive intelligence, technical documentation
💹 Crypto Analytics Agent
Specialized financial analysis agent with deep blockchain and DeFi expertise:
Real-Time Market Data: Integrates with Binance, CoinGecko, and DefiLlama APIs
On-Chain Analytics: Access to Arkham Intelligence for wallet tracking and token flows
Technical Analysis: Advanced charting with OHLC data and market indicators
DeFi Metrics: TVL tracking, yield analysis, protocol comparisons
Secure Execution: Runs analysis in E2B sandboxes with data persistence
Perfect for: Token research, portfolio analysis, DeFi protocol evaluation, market trend analysis
All three agents demonstrate ROMA's recursive architecture in action, showing how complex queries that would overwhelm single-pass systems can be elegantly decomposed and solved. They serve as templates and inspiration for building your own specialized agents.
Your First Agent in 5 Minutes
./setup.sh
# Automated setup with Docker or native installation
Access all the pre-defined agents through the frontend on localhost:3000 after setting up the backend on localhost:5000. Please checkout Setup and the Agents guide to get started!
# Your first agent in 3 lines
from sentientresearchagent import SentientAgent
agent = SentientAgent.create()
result = await agent.run("Create a podcast about AI safety")
📊 Benchmarks
We evaluate our simple implementation of a search system using ROMA, called ROMA-Search across three benchmarks: SEAL-0, FRAMES, and SimpleQA.
Below are the performance graphs for each benchmark.
SEAL-0
SealQA is a new challenging benchmark for evaluating Search-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results.
FRAMES
View full results
A comprehensive evaluation dataset designed to test the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems across factuality, retrieval accuracy, and reasoning.
SimpleQA
View full results
Factuality benchmark that measures the ability for language models to answer short, fact-seeking questions.
✨ Features
