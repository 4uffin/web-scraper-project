Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
Use Helm to:
Find and use popular software packaged as Helm Charts to run in Kubernetes
Share your own applications as Helm Charts
Create reproducible builds of your Kubernetes applications
Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files
Manage releases of Helm packages
Helm in a Handbasket
Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.
Helm renders your templates and communicates with the Kubernetes API
Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
A description of the package (Chart.yaml)
One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
(like Debian or RedHat packages)
Helm Development and Stable Versions
Helm v4 is currently under development on the main branch. This is unstable and the APIs within the Go SDK and at the command line are changing.
Helm v3 (current stable) is maintained on the dev-v3 branch. APIs there follow semantic versioning.
Install
Binary downloads of the Helm client can be found on the Releases page.
Unpack the helm binary and add it to your PATH and you are good to go!
If you want to use a package manager:
Homebrew users can use brew install helm.
Chocolatey users can use choco install kubernetes-helm.
Winget users can use winget install Helm.Helm.
Scoop users can use scoop install helm.
Snapcraft users can use snap install helm --classic.
Flox users can use flox install kubernetes-helm.
To rapidly get Helm up and running, start with the Quick Start Guide.
See the installation guide for more options,
including installing pre-releases.

Roadmap
The Helm roadmap uses GitHub milestones to track the progress of the project.
The development of Helm v4 is currently happening on the main branch while the development of Helm v3, the stable branch, is happening on the dev-v3 branch. Changes should be made to the main branch prior to being added to the dev-v3 branch so that all changes are carried along to Helm v4.
