@GrantBirki
Hello! My name is Grant and I am a Senior Security Engineer at @GitHub.
Previously, I was a security engineer working on CDNs and deployment pipelines for @Nordstrom.
üî≠ I'm currently working on: Automation, security, devops, a ton of open source projects, public Actions workflows, deployment systems, self-hosted projects, and all things chatops.
üå± I'm currently learning: Rust/GoLang, new deployment patterns, novel production access controls, and custom GitHub Actions.
üíé I love Ruby maintain quite a few open source libraries (Gems).
üßë‚Äçüî¨ A core contributor for the-hideout, github/branch-deploy, runwaylab/runway, and github/entitlements-app.
üöÄ I created github/branch-deploy to help everyone ship faster and with ease.
I love to build, learn, support the open source community, and have fun along the way. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Here are a few of the open source projects I have created or help to maintain:
