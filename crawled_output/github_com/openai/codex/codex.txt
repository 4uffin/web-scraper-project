npm i -g @openai/codexor brew install codex
Codex CLI is a coding agent from OpenAI that runs locally on your computer.
If you want Codex in your code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf), install in your IDE
If you are looking for the cloud-based agent from OpenAI, Codex Web, go to chatgpt.com/codex
Quickstart
Installing and running Codex CLI
Install globally with your preferred package manager. If you use npm:
npm install -g @openai/codex
Alternatively, if you use Homebrew:
brew install codex
Then simply run codex to get started:
codex
You can also go to the latest GitHub Release and download the appropriate binary for your platform.
Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:
macOS
Apple Silicon/arm64: codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
x86_64 (older Mac hardware): codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
Linux
x86_64: codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
arm64: codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz
Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl), so you likely want to rename it to codex after extracting it.
Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan
Run codex and select Sign in with ChatGPT. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Team, Edu, or Enterprise plan. Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan.
You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires additional setup. If you previously used an API key for usage-based billing, see the migration steps. If you're having trouble with login, please comment on this issue.
Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Codex CLI supports MCP servers. Enable by adding an mcp_servers section to your ~/.codex/config.toml.
Configuration
Codex CLI supports a rich set of configuration options, with preferences stored in ~/.codex/config.toml. For full configuration options, see Configuration.
