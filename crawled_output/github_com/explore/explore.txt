For the Love of Code
A joyful summer hackathon for weird, wonderful, and wildly creative code
For the Love of Code is a global summer-long hackathon celebrating joyful, ridiculous, and wildly creative coding projects. Whether you’re building a bot that reviews your PRs like a concerned parent, finally doing something with that domain name you bought at 2AM, or inventing a programming language where every keyword is an emoji—this is your excuse to build the thing.
No startup pitches. No pressure. Just vibes.
Enter solo or with friends, and submit your project by September 22. Winners get Copilot Pro+, eternal nerd cred, and a feature on the GitHub blog.
Join in on the fun.
