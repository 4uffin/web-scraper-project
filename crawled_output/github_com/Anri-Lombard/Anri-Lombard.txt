Anri-Lombard/README.md
I'm Anri. I do to bugs what Hulk does to Loki.
Elaboration
Hi, I'm Anri Lombard. A student and engineer who typically takes pride in learning difficult concepts, then applying them to useful/interesting projects. Currently, the focus is on AI-centric projects; it is a deeply impactful yet complicated field that grabs my interest.
