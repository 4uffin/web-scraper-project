autofix.ci
GitHub App
autofix.ci
GitHub App
Automatically fix pull requests.
Pull Requests are often blocked on relatively trivial issues such as code formatting or leftover imports. Fixing these details is expensive as it requires additional roundtrips and context switching. autofix.ci automatically fixes such problems, unblocking development flow.
How it Works
1. Define a GitHub Actions workflow.
Run the same tools you use locally, then call autofix.ci.
jobs:
autofix:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
- run: cargo fmt
- uses: autofix-ci/action@8bc06253bec489732e5f9c52884c7cace15c0160
2. Receive automatic fixes.
autofix.ci will securely update pull requests if necessary.
For more details, see autofix.ci.
