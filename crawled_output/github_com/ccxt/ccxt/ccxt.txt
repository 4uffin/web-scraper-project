The list above is updated frequently, new crypto markets, exchanges, bug fixes, and API endpoints are introduced on a regular basis. See the Manual for more details. If you can't find a cryptocurrency exchange in the list above and want it to be added, post a link to it by opening an issue here on GitHub or send us an email.
The library is under MIT license, that means it's absolutely free for any developer to build commercial and opensource software on top of it, but use it at your own risk with no warranties, as is.
Install
The easiest way to install the CCXT library is to use a package manager:
ccxt in NPM (JavaScript / Node v7.6+)
ccxt in PyPI (Python 3.7.0+)
ccxt in Packagist/Composer (PHP 8.1+)
ccxt in Nuget (netstandard 2.0)
ccxt in GO
This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:
js/ in JavaScript
python/ in Python (generated from TS)
php/ in PHP (generated from TS)
cs/
in C# (generated from TS)
go/
in Go (generated from TS)
You can also clone it into your project directory from ccxt GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git
# including 1GB of commit history
# or
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git --depth 1
# avoid downloading 1GB of commit history
JavaScript (NPM)
JavaScript version of CCXT works in both Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and async/await syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is not excluded in your babel-loader config.
ccxt in NPM
npm install ccxt
//cjs
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
//esm
import {version, exchanges} from 'ccxt';
console.log(version, Object.keys(exchanges));
JavaScript (for use with the <script> tag):
All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from a CDN of your choice:
jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.5.4/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js
unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ccxt@4.5.4/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js
CDNs are not updated in real-time and may have delays. Defaulting to the most recent version without specifying the version number is not recommended. Please, keep in mind that we are not responsible for the correct operation of those CDN servers.
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@4.5.4/dist/ccxt.browser.min.js"></script>
Creates a global ccxt object:
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
Python
ccxt in PyPI
pip install ccxt
import ccxt
print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes
The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.7.0+
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt
orjson support
CCXT also supports orjson for parsing JSON since it is much faster than the builtin library. This is especially important when using websockets because some exchanges return big messages that need to be parsed and dispatched as quickly as possible.
However, orjson is not enabled by default because it is not supported by every python interpreter. If you want to opt-in, you just need to install it (pip install orjson) on your local environment. CCXT will detect the installion and pick it up automatically.
PHP
ccxt in PHP with Packagist/Composer (PHP 8.1+)
It requires common PHP modules:
cURL
mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
PCRE
iconv
gmp
include "ccxt.php";
var_dump (\ccxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes
The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode using tools from ReactPHP in PHP 8.1+. Read the Manual for more details.
.net/C#
ccxt in C# with Nuget (netstandard 2.0 and netstandard 2.1)
using ccxt;
Console.WriteLine(ccxt.Exchanges) // check this later
Go
ccxt in GO with PKG
go install github.com/ccxt/ccxt/go/v4@latest
import "ccxt"
fmt.Println(ccxt.Exchanges)
Docker
You can get CCXT installed in a container along with all the supported languages and dependencies. This may be useful if you want to contribute to CCXT (e.g. run the build scripts and tests — please see the Contributing document for the details on that).
Using docker-compose (in the cloned CCXT repository):
docker-compose run --rm ccxt
You don't need the Docker image if you're not going to develop CCXT. If you just want to use CCXT – just install it as a regular package into your project.
Usage
Intro
The CCXT library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part immediately after installation. Public APIs provide unrestricted access to public information for all exchange markets without the need to register a user account or have an API key.
Public APIs include the following:
market data
instruments/trading pairs
price feeds (exchange rates)
order books
trade history
tickers
OHLC(V) for charting
other public endpoints
In order to trade with private APIs you need to obtain API keys from an exchange's website. It usually means signing up to the exchange and creating API keys for your account. Some exchanges require personal info or identification. Sometimes verification may be necessary as well. In this case you will need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchanges expose API endpoints for registering an account, but most exchanges don't. You will have to sign up and create API keys on their websites.
Private APIs allow the following:
manage personal account info
query account balances
trade by making market and limit orders
deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto funds
query personal orders
get ledger history
transfer funds between accounts
use merchant services
This library implements full public and private REST and WebSocket APIs for all exchanges in TypeScript, JavaScript, PHP and Python.
The CCXT library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in TypeScript and JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.
// both of these notations work in JavaScript/Python/PHP
exchange.methodName ()
// camelcase pseudocode
exchange.method_name () // underscore pseudocode
Read the Manual for more details.
JavaScript
CCXT now supports ESM and CJS modules

if err != nil {
fmt.Println("Error: ", err)
} else {
fmt.Println("Got OHLCV!")
}
}
Optional parameters
Unlike Javascript/Python/PHP/C# Go does not support "traditional" optional parameters like function a(optional = false). However, the CCXT language and structure have some methods with optional params, and since the Go language is transpiled from the Typescript source, we had to find a way of representing them.
We have decided to "go" (pun intended) with Option structs and the WithX methods.
For example, this function FetchMyTrades supports 4 different "optional" parameters, symbol, since, limit, and params.
func (this *Binance) FetchMyTrades(options ...FetchMyTradesOptions) ([]Trade, error)
And we can provide them by doing
trades, error := exchange.FetchMyTrades(ccxt.withFetchMyTradesSymbol("BTC/USDT"), ccxt.WithFetchOHLCVLimit(5), ccxt.WithFetchMyTradesParams(orderParams))
Lastly, just because the signature dictates that some argument like symbol is optional, it will depend from exchange to exchange and you might need to provide it to avoid getting a SymbolRequired error.
You can check different examples in the examples/go folder.
CCXT CLI
Read the documentation for more information and details: docs
CCXT also provides a command-line interface (CLI) that enables direct interaction with any supported exchange from the terminal. You can quickly check balances, place orders, or fetch trade data—without the need to write or execute custom code. This is especially useful for simple or time-sensitive tasks that don’t warrant the overhead of building a full application.
Installation
The CLI is available as a npm package and can be installed by doing
npm i ccxt-cli -g
Usage
You can use the --help option to view a general overview of how the CLI works. The tool allows you to invoke any CCXT method by specifying the exchange id, the methodName, and any required arguments.
Examples:
ccxt binance createOrder BTC/USDT market buy 0.1 // places an order
If you are not sure which arguments should be provided you can always use the explain command.
ccxt explain createOrder
result:
Method: createOrder
Usage:
binance createOrder <symbol> <type> <side> <amount> [price] [params]
Arguments:
- symbol
(required) — Market symbol e.g., BTC/USDT
- type
(required) — (no description available)
- side
(required) — order side e.g., buy or sell
- amount
(required) — (no description available)
- price
(optional) — Price per unit of asset e.g., 26000.50
- params
(optional) — Extra parameters for the exchange e.g., { "recvWindow": 5000 }
You can easily provide API keys by setting them as environment varibales eg: BINANCE_APIKEY="XXXX" or adding them to the config file located at $CACHE/config.json
