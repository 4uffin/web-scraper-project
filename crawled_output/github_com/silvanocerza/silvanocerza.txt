silvanocerza/README.md
Hey there! 👋
I'm Silvano. 🧝
I get things done. 🔨🔨🔨
Long time Open Source contributor, worked on tons of different projects spanning the whole stack. Python expert, used to work with Go, C++ too. Can handle Typescript, React and Node but wouldn't call myself an expert. Had a brief stint with Clojure/Script. Trying to work more with Rust. I like to think of myself as a generalist.🔥
Currently working on some interesting projects. 🧑‍💻
Used to work at Arduino and Pitch. 🧓
I have a nice personal blog over here. 🏡
If you want to get in touch with me I'm quite easy to find. 🗺️
