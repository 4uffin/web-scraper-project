My name is Jordan. I'm an open source developer based in the U.S.
I spend much of my time working on various open source projects, my latest one being Ice, a menu bar manager that lets you hide and show your menu bar items and customize the appearance of your menu bar, with many more planned features on the way!
My goals with sponsoring are to be able to work full-time on Ice and other projects like it, as well as to be able to purchase the equipment necessary to ensure my projects stay up to date with the latest technology. By sponsoring me, you're helping me achieve these goals!
