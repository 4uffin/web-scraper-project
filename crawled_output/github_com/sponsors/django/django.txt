Internet
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
ðŸ’¸ Funding
Django is managed by a non-profit, the Django Software Foundation, which actively supports Django developers and the community. It funds the Django Fellowship program, organizes and funds development sprints so Django developers can meet in person, and provides financial assistance to community development and outreach projects such as Django Girls.
Support for Django enables:
consistent releases, more features, and higher quality software
allows more time to be invested in documentation, issue triage, and community support
safeguards the future development of Django
contributes to new features including async support in releases 3.0+
