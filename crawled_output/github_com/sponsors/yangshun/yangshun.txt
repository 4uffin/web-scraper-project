Hi everyone! I've been an avid fan of Open Source since 2013 when I was first introduced to it in the Facebook Open Academy program where I built the front end for a HTML5 games store by Mozilla. After that, I've worked on NUSMods, a knowledge platform and timetable builder used by students of National University of Singapore.
While hunting for my next gig in 2017, I started documenting my learnings in the Tech Interview Handbook and the Front End Interview Handbook.
At Facebook, I work on Docusaurus on the side. It's a static website generator that powers the docs of React Native, Redux, Babel, Prettier and more!
I'm really into front end, JAMStack and tooling (basically anything that doesn't involve databases or back ends). That probably explains the choice of projects I work on.
With your support, I can work on building more front end tools and content for technical interviews (algorithms and front end-focused) to help people gain knowledge pass their interviews!
Thank you for your support! üôå
