Continuing the legacy of Vanced
Introduction
ReVanced was born out of Vanced's discontinuation, and our goal is to continue the legacy of what Vanced left behind. Thanks to ReVanced Patcher, it is possible to create durable patches for nearly any Android app, such as YouTube, Twitter, Tiktok, and many more. ReVanced's patching system is designed to allow patches to work on new versions of the apps automatically with bare minimum maintenance. ReVanced offers a variety of patches, including ad-blocking, custom themes, and innovative features. All of which is completely open source and free of charge. ðŸŽ‰
