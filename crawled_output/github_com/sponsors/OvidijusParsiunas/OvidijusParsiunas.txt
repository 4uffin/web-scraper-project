Tsukuba, Japan
I am a passionate developer based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, with a deep love for coding. In 2019, I embarked on a 100-day coding challenge, and four years later, I'm still coding every single dayâ€”no plans to stop anytime soon.
My primary focus is on crafting solutions that enhance developers' lives, particularly through the creation of low-code tools applicable to their projects. I have a keen interest in ML/AI and am dedicated to bringing more solutions in that domain.
Your sponsorship would greatly support me as I've recently taken a career break to concentrate on my open-source projects. Currently relying on my savings, every little bit helps!
For Private donations: your name will not be included in the README.md or the project's release notes without your explicit permission.
