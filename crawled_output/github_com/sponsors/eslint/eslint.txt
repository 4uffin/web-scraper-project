Who are we?
ESLint is an open source project that helps developers find and fix problems with their JavaScript code. It's the number one JavaScript linter by downloads on npm (over 18 million downloads per week) and is used at companies like Microsoft, Airbnb, Netflix, and Facebook. Due to ESLint's flexibility, it's also able to help find and fix problems in JavaScript derivative languages such as Flow and TypeScript, as well as for mobile development with React Native.
Why sponsor?
Your sponsorship supports the entire ESLint project. The funds collected are intended to support the development team, compensate those who make significant contributions to the project, support our dependencies and important ecosystem projects. Funding also allows us to send team members to conferences, companies, and meetups to meet with our users to discuss and solve the problems they are facing. Read more about how the money is used
