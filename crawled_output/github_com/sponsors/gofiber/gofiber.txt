New gophers that make the switch from Node.js to Go are dealing with a learning curve before they can start building their web applications or microservices. Fiber, as a web framework, was created with the idea of minimalism and follows the UNIX way, so that new gophers can quickly enter the world of Go with a warm and trusted welcome.
Fiber is inspired by Express, the most popular web framework on the Internet. We combined the ease of Express and raw performance of Go. If you have ever implemented a web application in Node.js (using Express or similar), then many methods and principles will seem very common to you.
We listen to our users in issues, Discord channel and all over the Internet to create a fast, flexible and friendly Go web framework for any task, deadline and developer skill! Just like Express does in the JavaScript world.
@gofiber's goal is to
have 10 monthly sponsors
This ensures the continued development of the Fiber project and sub repositories.
