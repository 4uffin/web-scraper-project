I create blog posts and open source packages mainly on JS and Go that I find will help me and others with similar problems. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible. You can see a full list of what I am up to on rubiin.ml. If you found value in something I have created or contributed to, please feel free to send a tip, give me a shout out @RubinCodes, give some hearts on DEV.to/rubiin
