lemire/README.md
Hi there 👋
I am a computer science professor at the Université du Québec. 🇨🇦
📰 I write about software performance weekly on my blog.
🏫 Among world's top 2% scientists (Stanford University/Elsevier ranking, 2024).
📺 I gave a best voted talk at QCon San Francisco on JSON parsing.
📄 I wrote over 90 research papers including over 60 journal articles.
📖 I am editor of the Software: Practice and Experience journal (Wiley); it was founded in 1971.
📎 On‐demand JSON: A better way to parse documents? was the most read article of the last 5 years at SPE (2024).
📎 Parsing millions of URLs per second was the most read article of the last 5 years at SPE (2025).
📘 My latest book: Mastering Programming: From Testing to Performance in Go
