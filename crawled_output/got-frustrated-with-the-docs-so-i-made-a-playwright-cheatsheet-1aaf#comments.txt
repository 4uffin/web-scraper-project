Got frustrated with the docs, so I made a Playwright Cheatsheet
#playwright

Every time I need to look up the Playwright docs, I open about 10+ tabs just to piece together what I need to know to solve my problem. And the doc pages... they are so long! Search is meh - I usually have to open about 3 results to find the right page. 🧐
So, I made a Playwright Cheatsheet: 🙂
all the most common commands and usage
tiny but useful code snippets to copy
and SEARCH!
Here you go! Please enjoy. Bookmark it if you like. Print it as a PDF or whatever.
Let me know if there's any incorrectness and feel free to suggest feedback to improve.
Disclaimer: I do work for a test automation company! But this is not a promo - just wanted to share something I made because I got really frustrated with the docs.

Haha I feel the same 😅 Playwright docs are super detailed but sometimes it’s a bit overwhelming. I also end up with a forest of tabs open just to find one small thing. Would love a more streamlined search or maybe a “quick recipes” style section for common use cases.

Yea search definitely needs some improvements.
Recipes is a good idea, though it feels like another project hahaha.
