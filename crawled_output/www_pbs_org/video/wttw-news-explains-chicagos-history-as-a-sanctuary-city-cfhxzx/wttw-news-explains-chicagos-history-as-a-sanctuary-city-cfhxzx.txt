some city council members are
trying to scale back
protections for undocumented
immigrants in Chicago.The
proposal comes from to older
people who have long opposed
the city's status as a
self-proclaimed sanctuary
city.The move comes as
President-elect Donald Trump
has promised to launch mass
deportations in his second
term.But how exactly did
Chicago become a sanctuary
city?And what does it mean?Joanna Hernandez explores the
topic in our W T Tw News
explains series.>> for decades Chicago has
held the designation of a
state city.But what does it
mean and how has Chicago
status indoors, the term
sanctuary city reverse any
jurisdiction that discourages
limits or denies cooperation
with federal immigration
authorities.There are
currently hundreds of
sanctuary communities in
America and 13 same jury
states.Where did they come
from while Berkeley,
California claimed the title
of first same jury city in
1971.The sanctuary city
movement really began popping
up across the country in the
Mid 1980's as President Reagan
focused on identifying and
deporting undocumented
immigrants, churches opened
their doors to provide shelter
in resources for Central
Americans fleeing civil war
and violence in Chicago
becoming and remaining a
stranger.Every city has been
a bit of mayoral tug of Mayor
Harold Washington first
declared Chicago a stranger
every city in 1985.Via
executive order.>> The order prohibited police
and city employees from
questioning residents about
their immigration status and
terminated cooperation with
federal immigration
authorities.Some argued the
policy shielded convicted
criminals from deportation.And in the 1990's, Mayor
Richard Daley interpreted the
policy to allow city officials
to provide immigration
information to the Fed's is
the subjects were involved in
serious crimes.Chicago, same
tree policies when from
executive order to a strong
law with the 2006 welcoming
city ordinance in 2012, Mayor
Rahm Emanuel in the city
council weaken the law,
allowing police to work with
federal officials in limited
cases I election in 2016

the loss of federal dollars.Nevertheless, Chicago City
Council voted to reaffirm
ordinance under Mayor Lori
Lightfoot and expanded

immigration authorities.Chicago enters its 40th year

Brandon Johnson has reaffirmed
Chicago's commitment.And
today thousands of refugees
and undocumented immigrants
have found a safe haven in

those who believe offering
sanctuary is a matter of human
rights.The point of
consternation for those see itCTA President Dorval Carter to ResignVideo has Closed CaptionsCCClip: 1/13/2025 | 3m 59s | Dorval Carter plans to resign on Jan. 31 after nearly a decade leading the agency.
