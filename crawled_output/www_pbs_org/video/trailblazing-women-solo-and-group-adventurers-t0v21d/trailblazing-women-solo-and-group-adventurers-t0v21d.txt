Arizona's trails some of the best in the world.So come on, let's take a hike.(upbeat music begins) Did you know that 45% of hikers in the US are women?Today, we're gonna highlight some of the amazing female trailblazers here in Arizona.We'll visit Lake Pleasant with a group of women who all hike together, shouldering backpacks and each other's burdens.And to start us off, we'll hike one of the most strenuous paths we're doing this season with solo backpacker, Naomi Grevemberg.(upbeat music begins) - [Narrator] "Trail Mix" is made possible in part by a gift from Sue and Bill Ahearn.(upbeat

chirp) (logo swooshes) - [Both] Welcome to the Grand Canyon!- [Jayarr] The Grand Canyon is one of the seven natural wonders of the world, and it's easy to see why.277 miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and encompassing the ancestral homelands of 11 tribal communities.The Grand Canyon is one of the most incredible locations to learn about Arizona history and geology, and a fantastic place for an inspiring and challenging hike.Our trek today will take the Bright Angel Trail from the top of the canyon down over 3000 feet to the recently renamed Havasupai Gardens.Today we're here with Naomi.Podcaster, author, and more importantly, solo backpacker.Naomi, thank you for hanging out with us today.How are you feeling about the trail?- I'm excited, it's a beautiful day and we get to be outside.- Yeah.Secret handshake?Uh.(both laugh) Hold on, no, no, we got this.We got this.Take two.Yes, you ready?- I'm ready.- All right, come on, let's take a hike.Is there anything you've been thinking about as far as precautions and preparation for the trail?- Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about the distance and the elevation that we're gonna be hiking today.So I wanted to be prepared by bringing a lot of water for hydration.That's really important.- Yeah, absolutely, I think considering that we're just big water bags ourself, it's good to bring water bags.You know what I'm saying?(gentle music continues) - [Naomi] Since 2016, I've traveled full-time in my van exploring the outdoors and sharing my experiences through my work as a storyteller, creator, podcast host, and author.I'm pretty passionate about unconventional lifestyles in general and making the outdoors accessible and enjoyable for everyone.So there are some unique challenges to solo hiking that I've faced.The biggest one is skepticism and concerns from others.- Family, friends.- Family and friends.They're questioning my life choices.- Yeah, because they're like, you're choosing to be homeless, why would you do that?- Yeah, and also safety concerns, you know?But for me, it's all about trusting myself, because solo hiking has presented so many opportunities to grow that I could never have imagined.(fact bubble pops) (upbeat music continues) - [Jayarr] Do you have any moments where you had to rely on your trust to keep you safe?- Oh, absolutely, I have many moments like that, but I think the one story that was most scariest, where it could have been a matter of my life, was in the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee.I was on a multi-day backpacking trip, and I had my first brush with wildlife.- [Jayarr] Okay.- [Naomi] A bear encounter.- [Jayarr] Oh my God, Black Bear or Grizzly?- [Naomi] A black bear.- [Jayarr] Okay.- [Naomi] And I was in an Appalachian Trail shelter for the night.In reflection, it was really a goofy moment with this bear.It was hiding behind bushes, circling around, eyeing my food bag.I thought I was in another world, like, what is happening right now?What should I do?But then I recalled all the articles I read about what you should do when you have a black bear encounter.So I found this old shovel and a garbage can cover, and I started banging it together, making a lot of noise, making myself big.And this bear had so many antics, just running around, darting behind bushes, circling around, eyeing my food bag.It felt like it went on for an eternity, but really it was just 10 minutes.- [Jayarr] Yeah, I mean, 10 minutes is kind of a long time to deal with a wild animal that could technically maul you.- [Naomi] Indeed.- [Jayarr] Yeah.- So eventually the bear left, but after the adrenaline started to wear off, that's when I realized how shaken up I was about this experience, and was actually contemplating leaving the shelter, packing up and just getting the heck outta there.Then I realized, okay, it's getting dark.It might not be safe for me to hike out 10 miles that night, so I decided to stay in the shelter.I snuggled up and rode out the night.On the hike out there was bear scat all around the shelter, all along the trail, and it just put an emphasis on learning to trust my gut when I'm out there.- [Jayarr] All right Naomi, what do you see?- [Naomi] I see the gardens.- [Jayarr] Where?- [Naomi] I think it's that green patch down there.- [Jayarr] Yeah, that's gotta be it.- [Naomi] It's gotta be it, right?- [Jayarr] If you were looking with your heart, what do you see?- [Naomi] I was looking with my heart, I see freedom.- [Jayarr] Yeah, it looks like freedom.- [Naomi] Miles and miles of it.- [Jayarr] Yeah, a lot of big open space.Space to grow in so many ways.What do you say we grow ahead and carry on with this trail?- [Naomi] Let's do it.- All right, come on.I'll take the cliff side.- Thank you.- Yeah.(gentle music continues) The Bright Angel Trail was named by the one armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell during the first ever recorded journey through the canyon on the Colorado River.He named the Flowing Creek that ran through the canyon after a phrase in a hymn, "Shall we gather at the river where bright angels' feet have trod."The canyon, fault, trail, and lodge were then named after the creek.(gentle music continues) Are there benefits to solo hiking versus group hiking?- I mean, I think there are benefits to both that's uniquely different.I love solo hiking because of the solitude that it brings.I get to be present in nature.It's my me time.And in group hiking, I mean, getting outdoors with friends, I mean, that's so much fun.We get to share in the experience.We get to laugh, we get to share meals, we get to laugh at each other hurting on a hike.I mean, there's just so much to each that I cherish.- Yeah, well, I'm glad you said that because I mean, we are together on this hike, so I'm glad that you're not completely opposed to group hiking.But I appreciate you breaking your norms.- Well, we still have to go up.Heading there.(Jayarr exhales) Close.- Thank you for saying that.- Let's go.- Thank you so much for saying that.(gentle music continues) (fact bubble pops) (water trickles) Oh my gosh.- [Naomi] My gosh.- [Jayarr] It is transforming into a literal paradise.- [Naomi] Oh, it's amazing.- [Jayarr] Shade.- [Naomi] So beautiful, so green.- I know, and there must be water nearby, just because of the, I mean, everything's blossoming.- [Naomi] Look at all the cacti.- [Jayarr] I know, it almost looks planned.You know what I'm saying?Like designed, it almost looks designed.- [Naomi] It's a dream.It's nature's design, right?Everything's possible.- [Jayarr] Havasupai Gardens is a natural oasis, 4.5 miles into the canyon, and fed by the tiny Bright Angel Creek before it drains into the Colorado River.Before the Grand Canyon National Park was created, native Americans lived in the area for thousands of years.Now the area is a verdant place to rest before continuing further into the canyon, and a destination in its own right.There's plenty of drinking water, restroom, and shade.And if you plan ahead, you can even get a permit to camp here under the stars.So what advice would you give women that are thinking about hiking solo for their first time?- Oh, man, that's such a great question.If you're thinking.(Naomi laughs) If you're a woman thinking about hiking solo, I mean, the first thing is get out and do it.It really takes not much to get started if you really wanted to, and it doesn't have to be this grand adventure, it could be a hike at your local park or at your local state park.Just get out there, a backpack, some water, a trail map.And I'm not trying to minimize the importance of being prepared, but I think the most important thing is the mindset shift that you belong out there, too.So just get out there and do it.Secondly, being prepared.Right?So for extensive hikes, I like to make sure that I meticulously research my route.Safety is important, the most important thing actually.And after researching that, I make sure that I share my itinerary with someone.When I'm going, when they should expect me back, and if I'm on the trail and I have service, I always check in.So that's really important.Having some kind of a GPS tracker or some GPS, you're able to send like emergency text.If I'm going out on multi-day backpacking trips, I always make sure I have one of those.It's really worth the investment at the end of the day, because again, it could be a lifesaver for you.Going back to trusting your instincts.If something doesn't feel right, then it probably isn't.- Yeah.- So being able to say, you know what?This doesn't feel right, I'm gonna change my plans.Or if I get out on the trail and I don't feel comfortable that day, or don't feel like I'm in the right mindset for it, I give myself permission to say, you know what?Not today.I'm gonna try this another day.- You wrote a book.- I did.- I want to hear about it.- [Naomi] It's called "Living the Van Life on the Road Towards Sustainability, Community and Joy."It's a part memoir, part practical road travel guide written through the lens of the intersections that I navigate as a black queer immigrant on the road outdoors, and I'm really proud of it.In it, it's filled with photography, my own photography from my life on the road.It's filled with a lot of practical tips from my perspective for anyone who wants to live a nomadic lifestyle, wants to live on the road.Also for anyone interested in getting outdoors.Hiking solo means keeping my spirits of adventure alive.It's how I am able to reconnect with myself away from all the distractions, connect with nature, because I get to be in it.Live in it, be a part of it, and learn from it.And it's crucial for me, for my creativity, for my joy.It's a liberating experience.And I don't think there's anything really more freeing than challenging myself.- Well, I'm so glad that you took something that burrows deep in your heart and have packaged it, not only with the book, but with your social media, and share it with the world.'Cause that's what we're doing here, right?We're trying to inspire people to get outside.So shout out to you on your mission, secret handshake.Yeah.(Naomi laughs) - Thank you.- Okay, well, the sun is super high in the sky.It's hot.I feel like this would be the perfect time to get outta the canyon.And we came down, well, you know what we have to do.- Go back out.- We gotta get out, yeah.So I say we get our quads, get some energy in our quads, and I say we hit the road.- Let's hit the road.- Come on.(gentle music continues) Ready?- [Naomi] Yeah, let's go.(fact bubble pops) (gentle music continues) (fact bubble pops) (gentle music continues) (Jayarr exhales) - Well, that was eight miles of intensity, and maybe a bit too much sun, and needing water, and quads are burning.How are you feeling?- Famished, tired, but happy.- Yeah, well, we made it.No, seriously, thank you.It's really been cool to get to know you and hear your story.And I really hope that this moment is able to spread and you're able to inspire more people to get out and hike solo.- Thank you for sharing the trail.- Yes, you're the best.Whoa, hold up!No, no, no, secret handshake.I'm tripping.Yeah, nailed it.So, no, seriously, thank you.And thank you as always for hiking the Bright Angel Trail.Catch you on the next one.(upbeat music continues) Ready for shoes off and a nice soft hotel mattress, and some salad, and some garbanzo beans, and anything that I can get in this belly.- [Naomi] I think I want a burger.- [Jayarr] Everyone hikes for different reasons.Some are looking for silence and solitude, Some are just looking for a fun way to get in a workout.but others hike to find comfort and community.Today we're hiking at Lake Pleasant along with Girl, Take a Hike, a hiking group dedicated to creating community out on the trails.Hikers of all levels are welcome and no one's left behind.- When I first started hiking nine years ago, never hiked before.This was all new to me and I didn't wanna be left behind.So my whole thought was, I don't wanna leave anyone behind.Why would I leave anyone behind?I don't wanna make anyone feel that way.So my intention was all hikers, all abilities, we'll wait for you.It's not a rush.So no one gets left behind.That's my motto.Welcome to Yavapai Point Trail.(group shouts) All right, just wanna say thank you to you ladies for coming out today and joining Girl, Take a Hike on today's trail.Today we're hiking Yavapai Point Trail.It's gonna be about three and a half miles with about 452 feet elevation.We're gonna go ahead and take it slow and easy.If you do need to stop to take a break, just let us know and we'll go ahead and stop.All right, let's take a hike.(upbeat music continues) The hardest hike that I had to do, physically challenging, I would say Picacho Peak.- I'd say the hardest was to the bottom of the Grand Canyon to Phantom Ranch.We hiked down North Kaibab Trail and then back up Bright Angel.- I haven't really had a chance to do any long or hard hikes yet, 'cause I just started hiking with Girl, Take a Hike.- The longest hike I've ever done is in the Mazatzals.It ended up being 23 miles, with I think almost 5,000 elevation gain.(upbeat music continues) - [Veronica] We're heading down just a little bit, be careful, the rock's a little loose here.- [Jayarr] Lake Pleasant Regional Park is a reservoir on the Agua Fria River.- [Veronica] Oh, look at the view.- [Jayarr] This beautiful desert oasis features more than a hundred miles of shoreline.- [Veronica] So pretty.- [Jayarr] Plenty of space for boating, fishing, camping, hiking, or relaxing.- We're half a mile in, so we have about three, three more miles left.This is a good little spot, very nice viewpoint.This is perfect.This is a very emotional thing for me to go out hiking, share the same bond with other women who also just enjoy hiking and just wanna come out and have fun, and be with other women who enjoy the same passion as they do.You find a rock and it has to match a state.So I try to find the 50 states.So a rock that resembles Texas, California, Wyoming, or Idaho, take a picture, we post it.- What I like about hiking with other women is that I get to experience nature while also healing my soul with some wonderfully deep conversations and just building friendships that are just harder to come across.- Yesterday, about three years ago is the anniversary that I lost my dad.Yeah, so I guess all along this trail today, I'm trying to find those heart rocks because it just kind of tells me that my parents are nearby.- I work in an office all day.There's just not a lot of chance to get out and connect with nature.And also not a lot of time to socialize.So this hits both of those at the same time.It's great.(group laughs) - [Veronica] You know, they say like that drunk women in the bathroom are the most supportive.I don't agree with that.I think it's hikers.I have yet to see a desert tortoise.I know you have seen it, Bonita, right?Oh, you haven't either?Bonita, you've seen a desert tortoise, right?You're there, Rosie.- It's always nice to come around the corner and see this view.That view, gorgeous.- [Veronica] everyone is in a different chapter of their lives, and kind of bouncing off, and getting feedback, and just talking life experiences with other women is great.I don't think that we do that anymore.I think that taking away that social media, going out there hiking with none of the internet around and having a real conversation, it's very meaningful.And we've grown to kind of build a family off of that because of those bonds.As people say, being around females that are supportive, that's just a tribe.I mean, if you have that in your life, then you're pretty solid, I think.(gentle music continues) (burro brays) - How cute.- There's three.- [Hiker] There's a little one!- [Veronica] It's a little baby!- [Jayarr] If you're hiking along the shores of Lake Pleasant, you're fairly likely to spot wild burros.The wild burros who live here are descended from North African burrows that Jesuit priests brought over in the 1600s.(gentle music continues) (fact bubble pops) - Every time I think that we pretty much just chill, like, just hang out here, having chill snacks.Kind of hang out for about 20, 30 minutes and then we'll head down.Kind of cool off.- This is my heart rock and so I brought it up with me.Normally, according to leave no trace, you're supposed to actually leave stuff where you found it.But I wanted to bring it up here, because the top is usually the part where you kind of celebrate.And so what I usually do is, whenever I find something, I'll just take that memory with me.And so basically I'll just take a little selfie with everything, with the heart rock, and then just kind of leave everything on the trail.This hike was actually pretty special for me because it allowed me to feel a little bit closer to my parents.And then to be able to just see an oasis in the desert, it's kind of like for, my heart is kind of like hurting right now, but it's like the oasis.When you see the oasis, the nature just comes right in, and like an oasis, just heals that part of you.- Hiking with other women is just amazing.- Inspiring.- Healing.- For me it's community.- They're supportive, they're understanding, and they get me through it.So yes, I appreciate you guys.- I feel like I am part of something in the community and get to meet women from all over the valley and the state and go to amazing places in Arizona.- [Jayarr] Trails in Arizona can be tough, long distances, high elevation, full of dangers like cliff faces, wild animals, prickly cactus, and treacherous terrain.But the women in Arizona are tougher.- [Group] Take a hike!- [Jayarr] From solo hikers like Naomi, conquering mountains and surviving bears by herself, to groups of hikers who stick together and carry each other's burdens, emotionally and literally.Women in Arizona are confidently blazing their own trails.- Thanks for joining us at the Yavapai Point Trail, and.- [Group] We'll catch you on the next trail.(group laughs) (upbeat music begins) - [Narrator] "Trail Mix" is made possible in part by a gift from Sue and Bill Ahearn.(upbeat music fades) Additional support provided by.viewers like
