SPECIAL EDITION OF ARIZONA'S HORIZON.I'M TED SIMONS.TONIGHT ARIZONA SENATORS MARK KELLY AND REUBEN GALLEGO JOIN US IN STUDIO TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES OF THE DAY AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY.GOOD TO SEE YOU.>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, TED.>> I'M TRYING TO KIND OF GET A MEASURE.WE WERE FAR AWAY HERE AND THE HEADLINES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IS IT AS CHAOTIC AS IT SEEMS INSIDE THE BELTWAY?>> IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS WHEN I WAS IN MY FOUR YEARS.WE'RE LESS THAN A HYUNDAIS IN AND THERE'S A LOT OF CHAOS.UNCERTAINTY, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, UNCERTAINTY WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, CANADA, OUR EUROPEAN ALLIES, EVEN UNCERTAINTY IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADVERSARIES.BUT I REALLY WORRY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE SPENT DECADES REFINING AND HOW THIS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS TREATED OUR FRIENDS.>> AND BRIGHT LIGHTS IS THE WAR IN UKRAINE.AND TODAY SPEAKING OF ISSUES OF THE DAY, UKRAINE BASICALLY SAID NO SO THE U.S. PROPOSAL TO END THE WAR.THAT U.S. PROPOSAL, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE RUSSIAN PROPOSAL; IS IT NOT?>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GIVE UP BEFORE NEGOTIATIONS STARTED.IF YOU GO BACK A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE WELL PRESIDENT TRUMP, WITH THE VICE-PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF STATE, THAT WAS A TIME WHERE THEY GAVE UP TWO BIG REALLY STICK POINTS THERE, HIS FAITH IN MEMBERSHIP AND CRIMEA WAS PART OF IT.CRIMEA WAS TRADITIONALLY PART OF UKRAINE AND ALL OF THAT TERRITORY IS PART OF UKRAINE.THOSE TWO NEGOTIATING POINTS WERE GIVEN UP BEFORE THE NEGOTIATIONS STARTED.SO AT THIS POINT THE ADMINISTRATION IS KIND OF LEANING ON THE SIDE OF WHAT THE RUSSIAN'S PLAN FOR A CEASE FIRE IS.THAT IS NOT IN OUR BEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY.WE CANNOT COME OUT OF THIS WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHO'S NOW A WAR CRIMINAL -- WHERE VLADIMIR PUTIN THINKS THAT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA TO INVADE UKRAINE.AND YET, THAT POSITION WAS VERY STRONG AMONG REPUBLICANS AND G.O.P.CIRCLES FOR YEARS.IT IS NOT STRONG NOW.WHAT HAPPENED?>> WELL, IT SHOWS THE INFLUENCE OF THIS PRESIDENT ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.AND RIGHT NOW HE'S VERY EFFECTIVE AT GETTING THE PUBLIC AND THE HOUSE AND SENATE TO GET IN LINE.WHAT WE NEED TO GET THIS BACK ON TRACK IS FROM MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, ESPECIALLY IN THE SENATE, TO GET OFF THE SIDELINES, TO GET OUT OF THAT LINE, DON'T FALL IN LINE BEHIND THE PRESIDENT.FALL IN LINE WIND HAS IS RIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF OUR ALLIES.>> ARE YOU HEARING FROM YOUR REPUBLICAN FELLOW SENATORS THERE?ARE YOU HEARING BEHIND THE SCENES, UNDER THE MICROPHONES THAT SENTIMENT, THAT THEY'RE AFRAID TO SAY SOMETHING?WE HEARD ALYSSA MARKOWSKI SAY THAT SHE'S AFRAID, AND OTHER REPUBLICANS ARE AFRAID.YOU HEARING THAT?>> YES.I MEAN, YOU HEAR DIFFERENT THINGS IN PRIVATE THAN YOU SEE IN PUBLIC.I THINK THAT'S TRUE FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS BUSINESS.THEY'RE IN A CHALLENGING POSITION.BUT WHAT I -- I THINK WHAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING IS THINKING LONG TERM AND BIG PICTURE.DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO BE ON THE SCENE FOREVER.HE'S GOT LIMITED TIME AND THIS TERM.HE TALKS ABOUT A THIRD TERM IN OFFICE.THAT'S NOT A REALISTIC THING FOR HIM.I THINK HE SAYS THIS JUST TO GET CONTROVERSY OUT THERE.THEY NEED THINK ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR NATION NEXT YEAR, NEXT DECADE, OVER THE DECADES TO COME, AND THE POLICIES, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER ALLIES IS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IN MY VIEW IS FLAWED.>> WHAT HAPPENS IF THE U.S.ABANDONS UKRAINE?>> WELL, I THINK THEY -- WE'LL SEE HOW MUCH THE EUROPEANS CAN STEP IN TO SUPPORT THEM.THEY CERTAINLY CAN DO MORE.I THINK THEY WILL DO MORE.BUT WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT, WITHOUT OUR LEADERSHIP, WITHOUT US RALLYING OUR ALLIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS ALLY, UKRAINE, ULTIMATELY I THINK THE CHANCE OF RUSSIA BEING SUCCESSFUL IS MUCH, MUCH HIGHER WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT.>> AND LAST QUESTION ON THIS, WHY DOES IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE PRESIDENT CONSTANTLY AND REPEATEDLY AND CONSISTENTLY LEANS TOWARD RUSSIA, NOT JUST ON THIS ISSUE, BUT IN OTHER ISSUES?WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?>> WELL, TED, I THINK THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WE'LL NEVER KNOW.BUT HE DOES SEEM TO HAVE THIS AFFINITY FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN IN A WAY THAT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.YOU KNOW, PUTIN IS A DICTATOR.HE'S A AN AUTHORITARIAN.HE'S A MURDERER, AND HE IS ALWAYS GOING TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES.I WISH THE PRESIDENT WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.HE DOES NOT SEEM TO.>> ALL THIS AS THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, THE U.S. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT APPEARS TO BE IN TURMOIL.YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE.AS SECRETARY OF DEFENSE -- GOODNESS GRACIOUS, THE SIGNAL CHATS, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?>> RIGHT BEFORE HIS CONFIRMATION VOTE, WHETHER IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER HE HAD THE VOTES OR NOT, I SAID TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, I SAID, ARE YOU SURE?ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO PUT THIS GUY IN THIS JOB?THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED JOBS ON THE PLANET, AND NO OFFENSE, TED, TO JOURNALISTS AND JOURNALISM, YOU GUYS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE, BUT 9 YEARS AS A SATURDAY MORNING HOST ON FOX NEWS DOES NOT PREPARE YOU TO RUN ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED ENTERPRISES IN THE WORLD WITH MILLIONS OF EMPLOYEES AND HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND $850 BILLION BUDGET.HE IS ILL-EQUIPPED, AND HE HAS PROVEN THAT OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS.>> AND YET, WE'RE HEARING FROM REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL THAT THIS IS A MEDIA CREATION HERE, THAT THE STRIKES IN YEMEN, WHICH ARE THE SIGNAL CHATS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, THAT THE STRIKES IN YEMEN WERE SUCCESSFUL, THAT MORAL IN THE MILITARY IS UP, AND THAT RECRUITMENT IS UP, AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE AS JOURNALISTS SHOULD BE CONCENTRATING ON.>> WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE STRIKES.I USED TO FLY STRIKES OFF OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, THE FIRST GULF WAR I FLEW 30 COMBAT MISSIONS OVER IRAQ AND KUWAIT.THERE WAS NO WORLD WHERE IT WOULD HAVE EVER OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WAS GONNA LET PEOPLE KNOW ON AN UNSECURED SYSTEM WHAT MY LAUNCH TIME WAS, WHAT MY TIME ON TARGET WAS, THE PLATFORM I WAS FLYING, WHAT WEAPON SYSTEMS WERE GOING TO BE DEPLOYED.THAT IS NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY WOULD EVER EXPECT TO HAPPEN.THEY SAY THIS WAS NOT CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.OR IT'S NOT A WAR PLAN.THIS IS THE MOST SENSITIVE INFORMATION WE HAVE.WHEN ARE WE SENDING TROOPS OVER THE BEACH?WHEN ARE WE SENDING THEM ON A MISSION?THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE TRY TO KEEP MORE CLOSELY HELD THAN THAT, AND HE PUT IT ON AN UNSECURED SYSTEM.HE DID IT MORE THAN ONCE.HE DID IT WITH PEOPLE THAT DID NOT HAVE SECURITY CLEARANCES.I DON'T BELIEVE HIS WIFE HAS A SECURITY CLEARANCE.WHO DID SHE THEN SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH?IN THIS CASE, WE GOT LUCKY.WE REALLY GOT LUCKY THAT THAT INFORMATION DID NOT LEAK TO THE RUSSIANS OR WAS ACCESSED OFF SOMEBODY'S PHONE, THEIR PERSONAL PHONE FORECAST THE RUSSIANS, GOT TRANSMITTED TO THE IRANIANS AND THEN TO THE HOUTHIS.SURE, THE MISSION WAS A SUCCESS.GIVE THAT CREDIT TO THE UNITED STATES NAVY, TO THOSE PILOTS -- THAT MISSION WAS RISKIER BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AND HE SHOULD RESIGN BECAUSE HE IS NOT PREPARED TO DO THIS JOB.>> ALL THAT BEING SAID, THE PRESIDENT APPARENTLY, AND ROCHTDLY, LIKES SECRETARY HEGSETH, HE LIKES THE FACT THAT HE'S CHANGING THINGS.HE LIKES THE FACT THAT HE'S REARRANGING WHAT SOME SEE AS A BLOATED AND INEFFECTIVE MILITARY.>> I THINK WHAT HE REALLY LIKES IS THE GUY HE'S A GOOD ON TV.THAT'S WHY HE HIRED HIM.HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON TV.YOU SEE THIS IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.A LOT OF THE TOP FOLKS HAVE SOME CONNECTION, WHETHER IT'S -- YOU KNOW, DR. OZ OR OTHERS, THEY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN MEDIA.THEY DO NOT HAVE IN MANY CASES -- THEY DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY LEADERSHIP SKILLS AND THE BACKGROUND TO DO THE JOBS THAT THEY'RE ASSIGNED.>> WHAT ARE YOU HEARING IN MILITARY CIRCLES ABOUT ALL THIS?>> WELL, IT'S RATHER CHAOTIC AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE OF THE PERSON WHO'S IN CHARGE.AND WE SEE GENERAL HAWK AS AN EXAMPLE, THE HEAD OF THE NSA, INCREDIBLY QUALIFIED GUY WHO HAD STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, JUST FIRED BECAUSE AN INTERNET TROLL COMES INTO THE OVAL OFFICE AND SAYS YOU SHOULD FIRE THIS GUY.THE HEAD OF CYBER BE COMMAND AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY GETS FIRED BECAUSE OF SOME CIVILIAN WHO DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE SOME THINGS THAT ME DONE IN HIS PAST.HE WAS AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE LEADER.>> BUT AGAIN, MY QUESTION IS, OBVIOUSLY, YOU HAVE -- YOU SEE THIS A CERTAIN WAY AND OTHERS SEE THIS A CERTAIN WAY.NO DOUBT IN THE MILITARY.BUT THE MILITARY AS A WHOLE, DO THEY AGREE WITH YOU, OR DO THEY SEE THIS AS "SHOW ME THE MISSION, I'LL GET THE JOB DONE -- DOESN'T MATTER WHO SECRETARY OF DEFENSE IS.">> I THINK IT MATTERS WHO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY.THEY NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PERSON'S LEADERSHIP.AND I'M NOT SAYING EVERYBODY HAS LOST CONFIDENCE IN HIM.YOU KNOW, FOLKS IN THE MILITARY, THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE, RIGHT.THEY VOTE, THEY'VE GOT POLITICAL OPINIONS.HE CERTAINLY DOES STILL HAVE SUPPORTERS IN THE MILITARY, BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, THEY ARE THEY ARE ARE REPUBLICANS FROM THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS THAT ARE CALLING FOR HIM TO RESIGN OR BE FIRED.>> TARIFFS, THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO BE BACKING OFF A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS TARIFFS AGAINST CHINA.THIS IS A WHIPLASH ECONOMIC POLICY AT BEST, AND YET SUPPORT HE WAS OF THE PRESIDENT WILL SAY THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.THIS IS HIS WAY OF NEGOTIATING A DEAL AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE STEPPING UP AND THEY'RE READY TO MAKE A DEAL.WHAT SAY YOU?>> WELL, HE JUST NEGOTIATED MILLIONS OF AMERICANSS OUT OF TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS.HE DESTROYED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT AMOUNT OF WEALTH THAT WAS IN OUR ECONOMY THAT JUST EVAPORATED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD PLAN.HISTORY PLAN COMES FROM PETER NAVARRO, BECAUSE PETER NAVARRO WROTE A BOOK, HAS A MADE-UP ECONOMIST IN THE BOOK.I CAN'T FIND ANY ECONOMIST OR ARED BUSINESS LEADERS THAT SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP'S TARIFF PLAN IS A GOOD PLAN THAT'S GONNA HELP OUR ECONOMY.AND SO FAR ALL IT HAS DONE IS A LOT OF DAMAGE.NOW, I SUPPORT TARGETED TARIFFS WHEN THEY MAKE SENSE TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.THAT'S NOT THIS.AND ON TOP OF IT, HE -- HE'S CHANGING HIS MIND ALMOST DAILY.145% ON CHINA.25% ON MEXICO.NOW WE'LL MAKE IT 10%.NOW WE'LL SUSPENDED IT FOR 10 DAYS, NOW WE'LL SUSPEND IT FOR 90 DAYS.IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS LEADER -- I WAS AT A COMPANY CALLED BENCHMARK TODAY, THAT MAKES A LOT OF COMPONENTS FOR OUR DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.THAT'S THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN, IS THAT THIS IS STILL UNPREDICTABLE, THE SAME THING DOWN IN KNOW GAMES ON MONDAY, THEY CAN'T -- NOGALES ON MONDAY, THEY CAN'T PLAN, THEY CAN'T DECIDE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO CHARGE THEIR CUSTOMER WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TARIFF WILL BE 20% OR 145% OR SUSPENDED FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS OR IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY COMPLETELY.>> LAST QUESTION, REAL QUICKLY, FOR THOSE OF US HERE IN ARIZONA WATCHING, SEEING ALL OF THIS UNFOLDING IN WASHINGTON, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE IS.>> GET INVOLVED.I MEAN, THESE THINGS MATTER.THEY MATTER TO YOU.TARIFFS ARE GOING TO RAISE COSTS FOR YOUR FAMILY.PRICES ARE GOING TO GO UP UNLESS THESE TARIFFS GO AWAY.EVEN COURAGE PRESIDENT TO GET RID OF THEM.START OVER AGAIN AND HAVE REAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR ALLIES AND WITH COUNTRIES THAT ARE -- WE TYPICALLY THINK OF OUR ADVERSARIES BUT ALSO BIG TRADING PARTNERS.HAVE REAL NEGOTIATIONS.DON'T KIND OF RANDOMLY THROW TARIFFS AT 100-SOMETHING COUNTRIES.WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.AND AGAIN, LOOK BACK IN HISTORY, IT'S REALLY EASY TO PUT TARIFFS ON.IT'S A LOT HARDER TO GET THEM TO COME OFF.AND TARIFFS ARE PAID BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BY TAXPAYERS.I DON'T CARE WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAYS, THAT IT'S THE FOREIGN COUNTRY THAT'S PAYING THE TARIFFS.THAT IS NOT TRUE.THEY ARE PAID HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THE COST GETS PASSED ON TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER.SO GET INVOLVED.SPEAK UP.>> SENATOR MARK KELLY, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.THANKS FOR JOINING US.>> THANK YOU, TED.>> EARLIER TODAY, SENATOR RUBEN GALLEGO JOINED US IN STUDIO.SENATOR GALLEGO, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.>> THANKS, TED.>> I'M CURIOUS, FROM A DISTANCE, IT LOOKS LIKE MAYHEM BACK IN WASHINGTON.WHAT IS THE MOOD ON CAPITOL HILL?>> LOOK, I THINK THERE IS A WANT FOR BIPARTISANSHIP, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY FOR THE SENATE AND REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO GET WORKING TOGETHER IN A MANNER THAT WILL BENEFIT THIS COUNTRY IN THE SHORT TERM/LONG TERM.BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE ADMINISTRATION KIND OF DISRUPTS ALL OF THAT, AND REALLY CAUSES THE CHAOS THAT YOU'RE SEEING ON TV AND WHAT YOU'RE FEELING EVERY DAY.>> WE'RE HEARING SOME ON THE LEFT SAYING DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS AND ON CAPITOL HILL NOT FIGHTING BACK HARD ENOUGH AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT.>> I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ON THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING AT THE LEVEL THAT WE NEED TO BE AT EVERY STEP.NOW, I THINK A LOT OF OUR COME PATRIOTS WANT US TO FIGHT FROM DAY ONE.THE SENTIMENT OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, AND ARIZONANS, WHO I HAVE TO ANSWER TO MORE SO THAN A PARTY, THEY WANTED US TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF WE COULD FIND SOME COMPROMISES AND WORK TOGETHER, AND WE DID DO THAT, AND NOW WE'RE SEEING OF COURSE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS OUTSTRIPPING THE FEELING SENTIMENT FOR THE PUBLIC AND WE'RE FIGHTING HIM AT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE AND TIME.>> I WANT TO GET TO SOME PARTICULAR ISSUES.LET'S START WITH MEDICAID, BECAUSE THIS HAS A LOT OF FOLKS HERE IN ARIZONA WORRIED.>> THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED.>> LOOKING FOR $880 BILLION IN CUTS, MEDICAID, MEDICARE ALMOST CAN'T BE AVOIDED THERE.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT MEDICAID IN ARIZONA, ACCESS IN ARIZONA?>> WELL, THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED.THE BILL THAT THEY PASSED TO THE ENC COMMITTEE HAVE TO CUT $880 MILLION FROM THEIR COMMITTEE.THE ONLY WAY YOU DO THAT IS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, I'M HOPING THEY'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO TOUCH MEDICARE, THAT'S THE THIRD RAIL OF POLITICS BUT MEDICAID IS ALSO IN MY OPINION TOO.I'VE BEEN TRAVELING THE STATE ACTUALLY HAVING TOWN HALLS IN RURAL ARIZONA IN WHAT PEOPLE WOULD CALL RED ARIZONA, AND RURAL ARIZONA IS MORE DEPENDENT ON MEDICAID THAN URBAN ARIZONA, MARICOPA AND PIMA COUNTY.30% OF THE RESIDENTS OF RURAL ARIZONA ARE ON MEDICAID.THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON MEDICAID AND MEDICAID EXPANSION.SO WHEN THEY GO AND CUT THE $880 BILLION, YOU'RE DIRECTLY AFFECTING THE COURSE OF THE COUNTRY AND THE STATE AND IT WILL ALL BE FROM JUST GIVING A BIGGER TAX CUT TO THE UBER RICH THIS COUNTRY.>> IS THAT MESSAGE GETTING THROUGH TO RED ARIZONA?>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IT IS GETTING THROUGH.WHETHER IT WAS IN DOUGLAS OR INDOORS ARIZONA THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING TO.WE'VE HEARD REPUBLICANS CAN BE VERY CONCERNED AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE POLLING WHERE REPUBLICANS SAY THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE MEDICAID CUTS IN EXCHANGE FOR MORE TAX CUTS.YOU'RE SEEING REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE COMMUNICATE TO THEIR LEADERSHIP THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE MASSIVE TAX CUTS ON THE BACKS OF MEDICAID CUTS.IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY WANT TO DO ANY BACKDOOR MEDICAID CUTS WHICH WILL STILL AFFECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ARIZONANS BUT AT MINIMUM AT LEAST YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE A NEAR IF THEY GO AFTER MEDICINE THEY'D THERE WILL BE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES TO THAT.>> AND YET THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAID, MEDICARE, MEDICAID NOT ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THEY SAY.SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT IT?>> WELL, YES.IF HE'S SAYING THAT, ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE THE ONE CONSISTENCY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HIS INCONSISTENCY.SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT THIS IS A REAL CRISES THAT YOU WILL BE KICK OUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AMERICANS, HOSPITALS WILL BE SHUTTING DOWN, PEOPLE LOSING THEIR JOBS, ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, TED, THIS IS AN OPTION.AN OPTION.THE PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS CAN EXTEND THE TAX CUTS FURTHER -- CAN'T EXTEND THE TAX CUTS FURTHER WITHOUT CUTTING MEDICAID.YOU'LL HAVE TO MAYBE GIVE UP GIVING THE TOP EARNERS A TAX CUT BUT YOU CAN STILL MAINTAIN THE MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS AS WELL AS HOLD WHERE THE CORPORATE TAX CUTS ARE NOW.BUT YOU DON'T THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO FURTHER AND DEEPER INTO GIVING TAX CUTS TO THE ULTRA RICH.THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS BY GOING AFTER MEDICAID.>> SPEAKING OF THE TAUGHT RICH, YOU WANT AN ETHICS PROBE AND POSSIBLE INSIDER TRADING ON WALL STREET ESPECIALLY WITH THE VOLATILITY OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING OF LATE.WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?>> THE ELITES OF THIS COUNTRY, SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ARE GETTING INSIDE INFORMATION OR SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE TRADING INSIDE INFORMATION.AND LEADING UP TO THE TARIFF PAUSE THAT THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED, ONLY FEW MINUTES BEFORE HE ANNOUNCED IT, THERE WAS A HUGE SPIKE IN BUYS OF STOCKS, SPECIFICALLY STOCKS WITH BENEFITS FROM THE PAUSE DUE TO THE TARIFFS.CLEARLY SOMEBODY KNEW IT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT SITUATION AND TOLD FRIENDS.I'M NOT SAYING THE PRESIDENT DID IT ON PURPOSE, EITHER.BUT I THINK LOOKING AT THE DATA, IT DOES DEMAND THAT WE HAVE AN INVESTIGATION.BECAUSE IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE AMERICAN CONSUMER, EVERY DAY STOCKHOLDER IF THEY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSIDER INFORMATION IN IS WHY IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE IN THE SENATE AND EVEN IN THE HOUSE, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE STOP MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM BUYING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND TRADING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, YOU KNOW, KNOWINGLY WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE.>> OKAY.YOU WANT AN INVESTIGATION.THERE'S SMOKE OVER THERE.BUT IS THERE FIRE?IS THERE EVIDENCE OF INSIDER TRADING?>> WELL, THE DATA SHOWS THIS THAT THERE WAS SUCH AN ABNORMAL SPIKE IN TRADING RIGHT BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAPPENED THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH SMOKE.NOW, I DON'T WANT TO GO AND SAY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE PROSECUTED FOR IT, BUT CLEARLYLY IF THIS HAD BEEN DONE IN ANY OTHER MARKET, INSIDE THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, THERE WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION.SO THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION HERE IF ANYTHING WAS INVOLVED, AND AFTER THAT PROCEED ACCORDINGLY.IF THERE'S NOTHING THERE AND JUST HAPPENS TO BE A GLITCH, THEN FINE.BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE ABNORMAL AMOUNT OF TRADES THAT HAPPENED MINUTES BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD NOT GO UNINVESTIGATED.>> ARE YOU CONFIDENT IN THE SEC TO DO SUCH AN INVESTIGATION CONSIDERING DOWNSIZING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON WITH AGENCIES BACK IN WASHINGTON?>> I'M NOT -- IT'S NOT THAT I'M CONFIDENT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THIS DATA WHEN EXPOSED DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED A DEEP INVESTIGATION.IT'S VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD.THESE ARE REGULAR MARKETS THAT HAVE A PRETTY GOOD TRACE, SO WE KNOW WHEN THINGS ARE BURKE HOW OFTEN THEY'RE BOUGHT AND AT THAT POINT WE COULD ALSO TRACE WHO HAD THE INFORMATION AND I THINK THE PUBLIC COULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT THE END OF THE DAY BUT AT LEAST HAVING THE INFORMATION PUBLIC WILL ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED MINUTES BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT.>> AND I KNOW YOU COMMENTED ON THIS AS WELL, V.A.EMPLOYEES, MASS LAYOFFS, PLANS FOR MAYBE 80,000.MORE CUTS TO THE V.A.LIKELY INEVITABLE.I KNOW YOU'RE AGAINST THAT KIND OF THING.WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT?>> WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS WITHIN MY POWER.FOR EXAMPLE, I'M HOLDING ALL V.A.POLITICAL APPOINTEES HOSTAGE, ESSENTIALLY, UNTIL WE GET A REAL PLAN FROM THIS V.A.ADMINISTRATOR THAT SHOWS US WHERE THESE CUTS, AND YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THESE CUTS ARE NOT GOING TO AFFECT SERVICES, TO MY OPINION, NOT JUST AS A CONGRESSMAN OR SENATOR, BUT SOMEBODY WHO HAS USED THE V.A., AS A YOUNGMAN RETURNING FROM THE IRAQ WAR, THE V.A.HELPED MY KNEE, GOOD AMERICAN PRODUCT RIGHT THERE, TITANIUM.I'VE USED THEM FOR MEDICAL SERVICES, I HAVE FRIENDS THAT USE IT TO THIS DAY.FOR THE LONGEST TIME WE'VE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LACK OF STAFFING AT V.A.THE NEEDS TO ACTUALLY RECRUIT SOME OF THE TOP SPECIALISTS AND DOCTORS.DOING THIS IS ONLY GOING TO TURN THAT CLOCK BACKWARDS AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO RECRUIT PEOPLE GOING INTO THE FUTURE.AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ENROLLMENT DROPPING IN THE V.A., LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAVE MEN AND WOMEN THAT SERVED IN THE WORLD WAR II AND THE KOREAN WAR ARE NOW DYING BUT BECAUSE A LOT OF US YOUNGER VETERANS ARE STARTING TO GET OLDER, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE ENROLLMENT INCREASE IN THE V.A.AND IF THE WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO MATCH THE DEMAND, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE WAIT TIME, PEOPLE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED, THE SERVICES THAT THEY WANT.WE'RE HEARING OF HORRIBLE SITUATIONS WHERE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TO DO THEIR PTSD THERAPY IN OPEN AIR CUBICLES, WHICH IS AWFUL TO DO, ALL BECAUSE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS MORE HELL BENT ON THESE CUTS THAN THEY ARE FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE GOOD, QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY JUST OBSESSED ABOUT A 15% CUT.IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE ANY SENSE NUMEROUS NUMERICALLY TO THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED.>> AND I'D ASK HOW THAT INFORMATION GETS OUT THERE, BUT WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT SHORT ON TIME.I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE PARTY IS STILL REELING AFTER THIS LAST ELECTION, THAT THE PARTY WAS ABANDONED BY THE WORK CLASS, A PROMINENT INTERVIEW IN THE NEW YORK TIMES A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, BASICALLY SAYING THAT THE MATTER SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ON THIS RAIL AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WAS ON THIS RAIL.WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE AS FAR AS THE PARTY IS CONCERNED ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH REPUBLICANS AND AT THE WHITE HOUSE?>> WELL, LOOK, THERE'S NO DENYING THAT WE HAD A TOTAL MISMATCH IN TERMS OF MESSAGE AND POLICY AND THE WORKING CLASS VOTER.I THINK NOW WE HAVE A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THEY'RE SEEING A HORRIBLE MANNER QUITE QUICKLY THAT WHAT WAS OFFERED AND WHAT WAS PROMISED IS NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO OCCUR.WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW INFLATION IS HIGHER.THE ECONOMIC FORECAST SHOWS A RECESSION IS COMING.INTEREST RATE ARE NOT GETTING ANY LOWER.AND SO THE PROMISE OF THE -- WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED HE WAS GOING TO CHANGE IT ALL IS NOT THERE.SO WHAT DID HE IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS IS HE FOCUSED ON THE RICHEST OF THE RICH AND AT THE SAME TIME CUTTING THE POOR WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICAID.THAT IS UNPOPULAR WITH THE WORKING CLASS THIS COUNTRY.THIS IS WHAT THE DEMOCRAT HAS TO REALLY SHINE.WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT WE ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR MAIN STREET, FIGHT FOR THE WORKING CLASS, PROTECT MEDICAID, PROTECT VETERANS ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE CUTS ARE ALL DESIGNED JUST TO FIND MORE MONEY TO GIFT TAX CUTS TO THE RICHEST OF THE RICH.THAT'S HOW WE WIN.>> AND I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED THIS TO SOME EXTENT BUT THE IDEA OF A PROMISE AMONG DEMOCRATS, MORE THAN WE'RE NOT HIM, WE'RE NOT THEM.IS THAT PROMISE THERE, AND IS THAT PROMISE CONNECTING?OR IS THERE STILL A DISCONNECT WITH MUCH OF AMERICA?>> I THINK THERE IS STILL A DISCONNECT BECAUSE WE'RE STILL NOT PRIMARILY WITHIN THE ELECTION SEASON.BUT SHOWING NUMBER 1 THAT OUR FIGHT IS THEIR FIGHT, SHOWING THAT WE ARE WILLING TO THROW DOWNTOWN GAUNTLET TO PROTECT MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE.TO MAKE SURE THAT MAIN STREET WILL SURVIVE THE VOLATILITY OF THESE CRAZY TARIFF WARS, TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE REAM WAGE GROWTH AND HAVE BUYING POWER, THAT'S HOW WE WIN THIS.NOW, WHEN WE START GETTING INTO THE NEXT YEAR, WITH VERY TO PUT TOGETHER A REAL POLICY AGENDA WHICH I THINK WILL BE INCUMBENT, THAT IS A STRONG STATEMENT, THAT SAYS THAT AMERICANS CAN HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THIS COUNTRY.THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME, START A BUSINESS, HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT AND A SECURE NEIGHBORHOOD.WHEN WE PUT THAT OUT THERE, THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO WIN.IF WE TRY TO HAVE AN ANTI-TRUMP MESSAGE, WE ARE GOING TO LOSE, BECAUSE THAT MESSAGE -- THE TRUMP MESSAGE IS ALWAYS STRONGER THAN THE NEBULOUS, ANTI-TRUMP MESSAGE.>> INTERESTING.AND QUICKLY, YOU TALKED IN A NEW YORK TIMES INTERVIEW AND YOUR OTHER INTERVIEWS AS WELL ABOUT LATINOS AND MALES ESPECIALLY AND THE GOMES, THE DREAMS THEREIN.THAT DEMOCRATIC PROMISE THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT, DOES THAT RESINATE WITH THAT COHORT?>> IT DOES, BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BACK IT UP WITH REAL WORDS AND REAL POLICIES, RIGHT.AND WHEN WE DON'T DO, THAT THAT'S WHEN WE START LOSING VOTES.YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THIS.THE OPINION OF LATINO VOTERS OF THE PRESIDENT HAS TURNED.THERE'S JUST A PEW POLL THAT CAME OUT WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS RUNNING 28% FAVORABLY WITH LATINO BECAUSE LATINOS LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DONE AND DISAGREE THAT THE FACT THAT HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING IN CHANGING THE ECONOMY, SPECIFICALLY THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUY AND OBTAIN THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND NUMBER 2, HE IS OVERSHOOTING WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICY.>> ALL RIGHT, SENATOR RUBEN GALLEGO, COULD I TALK TO YOU ALL DAY.THANKS FOR JOINING US.>>
