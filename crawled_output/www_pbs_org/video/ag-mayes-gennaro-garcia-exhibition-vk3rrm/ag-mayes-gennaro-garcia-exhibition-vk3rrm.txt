AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON ELECTION ISSUES, PUBLIC HEALTH CUTS, MASS FIRINGS AND MORE.>>> ARIZONA ARTIST SHOWCASES MEXICAN CERAMICS TECHNIQUES.THOSE STORIES AND MORE NEXT ON "ARIZONA HORIZON.".TED: GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO "ARIZONA HORIZON."I'M TED SIMONS.THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TODAY BLOCKED A LOWER COURT RULING THAT ORDERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO REHIRE THOUSANDS OF FIRED GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WHO HAD BEEN ON PROBATIONARY STATUS.THE COURT RULED THAT THE LABOR UNIONS AND NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT FILED THIS PARTICULAR SUIT HAD NOT SUFFERED INJURY THAT GAVE THEM STANDING TO SUE.THE DECISION DID NOT ADDRESS THE MERITS OF THE CASE.OTHER CHALLENGES TO MASS FIRINGS HAVE RESULTED IN DIFFERENT OUTCOMES AGAINST RULINGS, AND RULINGS AGAINST THE ADMINISTRATION.THOSE RULINGS WILL ALSO REMAIN IN PLACE.>>> ANOTHER BUMPY RIDE ON WALL STREET AS STOCKS OPENED HIGHER AMID SIGNS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MIGHT BE OPEN TO NEGOTIATION ON TARIFFS, BUT LATER IN THE DAY, THE WHITE HOUSE SAID IT WOULD GO AHEAD WITH ADDITIONAL 84% LEVIES ON CHINESE IMPORTS WITH, THAT THE RALLY WAS DONE.THE DOW CLOSED DOWN 320 POINTS.NASDAQ DOWN 335 AND THE S&P 500 FELL 79 POINTS AFTER STARTING OFF ON TRACK WITH THE BEST DAY IN YEARS.REPUBLICANS ON CAPITOL HILL SAY DESPITE THE WHIPLASH ON WALL STREET AND OTHER CONCERNS, THE PRESIDENT'S TRADE POLICIES NEED TO BE GIVEN A CHANCE.>> THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE PRESIDENT RAN ON THIS.THERE WASN'T A CAMPAIGN EVENT WHERE HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING OTHER COUNTRIES TO TREAT US MORE FAIRLY WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE, BILATERAL TRADE, MULTILATERAL TRADE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND 77 MILLION PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM IN HIS AGENDA AND DESERVES TO SEE WHAT DEALS HE CAN GET FROM TRADING PARTNERS.MOST OF US ARE GIVING HIM SPACE TO DO THAT AND HOPE HE'S SUCCESSFUL.THAT'S GOOD NOT ONLY FOR HIM AND THE ADMINISTRATION BUT THE COUNTRY.TED: DEMOCRATS ON THE HILL SEE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE -- >> THE CHOICE IN FRONT OF LEADER THUNE AND SPEAKER JOHNSON IS SIMPLE, ARE THEY GOING TO CHOOSE DONALD TRUMP, OR ARE THEY GOING TO CHOOSE AMERICAN FAMILIES?STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP OR WATCH HIM WALK US DIRECTLY INTO A RECESSION, AND SO FAR THEY'RE NOT STANDING UP.TED: MANY ECONOMISTS ARE CONCERNED INCREASING TARIFFS HAVE DONE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY WITH SOME PREDICTING THE U.S. ECONOMY WINDING UP IN A RECESSION LATER THIS YEAR.>>> ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL KRIS MAYES JOINED A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS CHALLENGING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ACTIONS RANGING FROM CHANGES TO ELECTION PROCEDURES TO CUTS IN FUNDING TO FEDERAL LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS ALONG WITH THE CUTS IN GRANTS FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.THAT WAS PAST WEEK.JOINING US NOW IS ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL KRIS MAYES.THANKS FOR MAKE TIME FOR US.>> YOU BET, IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK.TED: FIRST QUESTION HAS GOT TO BE, ARE YOU TROD FILE YET ANOTHER SUIT AGAINST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?>> WELL, I WOULD ASK THE QUESTION THIS WAY: DONALD TRUMP GOING TO ENGAGE IN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR AND CONTINUE TO VIOLATE OUR CONSTITUTION?AND IF HE DOES, THEN THE DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, 23 OF US WILL CONTINUE TO FILE LAWSUITS.THAT'S WHAT WE DID LAST WEEK, AS YOU SAID, WE HAD THREE LAST WEEK ALONE, AND WE'LL PROBABLY BE MORE.TED: I'M TRYING TO KEEP SCORE HERE, TEN SO FAR?>> 11.CLOSE.TED: 11.YOU HAD A QUOTE, I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A COUP, AND I DON'T USE THAT TERM LIGHTLY.EXPLAIN PLEASE.>> I BELIEVE THAT, AND BECAUSE WE ARE DEALING WITH A PRESIDENT AND AN UNELECTED BILLIONAIRE IN ELON MUSK, WHO HAVE REPEATEDLY VIOLATED FEDERAL COURT ORDERS ALREADY.SO FOR INSTANCE, THE DEMOCRATIC AGs HAVE HAD TO GO BACK IN WHEN WE WON A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, AND GET A MOTION TO COMPEL TO MAKE THEM ABIDE BY THAT FEDERAL COURT ORDER, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO CALL IT, TED, WHEN A PRESIDENT VIOLATES A FEDERAL COURT ORDER.SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT.TED: I'VE HEARD THOSE OF HIS SUPPORTERS SAY HE IS CHALLENGING THOSE COURT ORDERS.>> THE WAY YOU CHALLENGE A COURT ORDER IS APPEAL A COURT ORDER, THAT IS OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T CHALLENGE IT BY IGNORING IT.CAN YOU IMAGINE IF A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT HAD DONE HALF OF THE THINGS THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE?SO NO.THAT'S NOT HOW YOU CHALLENGE IT.YOU WIN IN THE COURTS.TED: WE JUST HEARD FROM SENATE MAJORITY LEADER THUNE SAYING THAT AMERICANS VOTED FOR TRUMP, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING AND ARE GETTING IT NOW.ARIZONANS VOTED FOR TRUMP, KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING.DO YOU THINK THEY KNEW THEY WERE GETTING THIS?>> NO.I DON'T THINK ARIZONANS -- I REALLY BELIEVED WE WOULD END UP WITH A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD ENGAGE IN THIS LEVEL OF UNCONSTITUTIONALITY.THIS LEVEL OF CRUELTY.YOU STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE FEDERAL FIRINGS.WE ACTUALLY, THE AG'S CASE IS STILL IN PLACE, OUR TEMPORARY ORDER IS STILL IN PLACE, AND THOSE FIRED EMPLOYEES, 25,000 OF THEM, JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE ON PROBATIONARY STATUS ARE NOW BEING REHIRED BY THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE THE COURT TOLD THE ADMINISTRATION THEY HAD TO.SO NO, I DON'T THINK SO.I THINK YOU SAW THAT WITH THE PROTESTS THIS WEEKEND, THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ARIZONANS CAME OUT AND SAID HANDS OFF MY CONSTITUTION.HANDS OFF MY DEMOCRACY.HANDS OFF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS ALL OVER THE STATE.TED: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THOSE THAT AGREE WITH THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER, THAT YOU NEED TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT TIME?I'VE HEARD THIS FROM A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO BASICALLY SAY THIS IS PANICKING, THIS IS SHORT-TERM THINKING, THE PRESIDENT IS SEEING THE LONG-TERM VIEW?>> YOU CAN'T GIVE ANY PRESIDENT TIME TO VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION.YOU CAN'T GIVE ANY PRESIDENT THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIOLATE THE RULE OF LAW, AND THAT'S OUR JOB.MY JOB AS ATTORNEY GENERAL IS TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW AND TO PROTECT ARIZONANS, AND ARIZONANS ARE BEING HARMED MASSIVELY BY MANY OF THESE ACTION BEING TAKEN BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.TED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SUIT AGAINST THE NIH GRANTS AND LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS.THESE WERE TWO DIFFERENT SUITS, HOW DID THIS WORK, BY THE WAY?>> SO ON THE LIBRARIES?THAT WAS ONE LAWSUIT.TED: AND THE NIH WAS ANOTHER ONE?>> SEPARATE ONE, CORRECT.AND WE HAD ONE ALSO AGAINST HHS.TED: TALK ABOUT THE FUNDS OF FEDERAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM.WHY WAS IT NECESSARY FOR ARIZONA TO JOIN THIS SUIT?>> THIS IS A DEVASTATING ACTION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND ALSO ILLEGAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.SO THEY BASICALLY DEMOLISHED SIX SMALL AGENCIES, AND ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING PUBLIC LIBRARIES.ALL ACROSS AMERICA.INCLUDING IN ARIZONA.ALL -- ALMOST ALL OF OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, TED, RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING, AND THE PROGRAMS ARE LITERACY PROGRAM FOR OUR CHILDREN, BRAILLE SERVICES FOR THE BLIND, YOU KNOW, AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL ARIZONA, IF THAT ACTION STANDS, WILL CLOSE.FLAT-OUT CLOSE.TED: YOU'RE TALKING RURAL LIBRARIES, SMALL TOWN LIBRARIES, THEY ARE THAT MUCH DEPENDENT?>> YEAH.I MEAN, THEY RECEIVE A LOT OF THE FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE MASSIVE CLOSURES OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACROSS RURAL ARIZONA.TED, I GREW UP IN PRESCOTT.I LEARNED TO READ IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN PRESCOTT, ARIZONA.I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THE KIDS WHO LIVE IN RURAL ARIZONA TO HAVE TO SEE THAT MONEY DRY UP BECAUSE WE HAVE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT.TED: MAYBE NOT FAIR, BUT AGAIN, THE LAWSUIT, I KNOW SOME OF THE OTHER LAWSUITS TALKED ABOUT OVERREACHING THE PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY.WAS THIS A CASE OF THAT?>> ABSOLUTELY.THIS IS A SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE.ALMOST ALL OF THE CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, TED, REALLY IMPLICATE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.ONLY CONGRESS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO GET RID OF AN ENTIRE FEDERAL AGENCY.TED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NIH GRANTS AS WELL.I THINK THAT'S AS WELL, YOU'RE SAYING OVERREACHING, OVERSTEPPING, BUT WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO ARIZONA?>> WELL, SO ARIZONA UNIVERSITIES RECEIVE, I THINK IT'S ABOUT $239 MILLION IN NIH GRANT FUNDING.THAT'S NOT EVEN TO SPEAK OF -- I HAVE TWO LAWSUITS ON NIH.THE FIRST ONE WAS EARLY ON, AND THAT WAS WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO SLASH THE INDIRECT RATE FOR OUR UNIVERSITIES, AND FOR ENTITIES LIKE BANNER HEALTH, WHICH WAS DOING ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH.WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING FROM THAT STANDPOINT.THIS IS THE GRANT'S PORTION OF NIH.THAT'S $239 MILLION IN RESEARCH FUNDING FOR SCIENCE AND FOR HEALTH.TED: AND THESE GRANTS ARE BEING DELAYED?SLOW-WALKED?WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?>> BOTH SLOW-WALKED AND COMPLETELY ELIMINATED.TED: BECAUSE?>> WHO KNOWS.AGAIN, THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDE THEY WANT TO OBLITERATE THE AGENCIES.I DON'T KNOW.IT'S A SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE.CONGRESS ALREADY APPROPRIATED THAT MONEY TO NIH, TO HHS, TO THE LIBRARIES PROGRAMS, YOU KNOW.NO PRESIDENT OF WHATEVER POLITICAL PARTY, HAS THE RIGHT TO OVERRIDE THE CONSTITUTION.TED: AND AGAIN, WHETHER IT COMES TO RESEARCH, THIS IMPACTS ARIZONA, A, AND B, IT IMPACTS ARIZONA'S RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES.>> ABSOLUTELY.IN A BIG WAY.BOTH THE HHS FUNDING, BUT ESPECIALLY THAT NIH FUNDING AS WELL.TED: TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION ORDER, WE HAD SECRETARY OF STATE FONTES ON, WHAT IS IT BESIDE THE OVERREACHING AUTHORITIES, THAT'S A COMMON THEME, A REOCCURRING MOTIF HERE, BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS ORDER THAT YOU THINK IS WRONG FOR ARIZONA?>> COUPLE BAD THINGS ABOUT THIS ELECTIONS ORDER.NUMBER ONE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT POTENTIALLY IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO CURE BALLOTS AFTER ELECTION DAY.YOU KNOW, WE DO THAT, AND ARIZONANS LIKE THE ABILITY TO CURE THEIR BALLOTS, AND SO WE THINK THE EXECUTIVE ORDER COULD IMPACT THAT, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT THE GENERAL ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OVER OUR ELECTIONS SYSTEM, AND YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IT IMPACTS US.TED: THE IDEA, THOUGH, OF OFFERING -- REQUIRING PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP IN ORDER TO REGISTER TO VOTE.I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING WOULD SAY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?>> FOR SURE, AND WE ALREADY DO THAT, SO THAT IS ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARIZONA AND SOME OTHER STATES THAT DON'T DO WHAT WE DO.IT'S REQUIRED DOCUMENTARY PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP.HERE'S WHAT TRUMP'S EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES THAT'S REALLY BAD FOR US, AND THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE DO.THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW YOU, UNDER HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER, THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW US TO USE BIRTH CERTIFICATES TO PROVE CITIZENSHIP.THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR THE USE OF TRIBAL IDENTIFICATION CARDS.TALK ABOUT IMPACTING OUR 22 TRIBES IN THIS STATE.THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW FOR NATURALIZATION DOCUMENTS TO BE USED.I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVE YOUR CITIZENSHIP IF YOU CAN'T USE THOSE THREE THINGS YOU.>> REFERRED TO THE 7:00 P.M.DEADLINE AS FAR AS GETTING BALLOTS IN.7:00 P.M. ON ELECTION NIGHT, CAN'T GET MAIL-IN BALLOTS AFTER THAT TIME ON ELECTION DAY.FOLKS THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?>> WE REQUIRE THOSE BALLOTS BE IN.THAT'S ANOTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES.THERE ARE CRITICAL THINGS, AND THE OTHER THING SECRETARY FONTES BROUGHT UP IN THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER, THEY WANT COUNTY RECORDERS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO SEND OUR DATA TO D.O.G.E.I DON'T THINK ARIZONANS WANT OUR ELECTION DATA AND PERSONAL DATA SENT TO D.O.G.E.TED: THAT'S THE ONE THAT RAISED THE MOST EYEBROWS AS FAR AS THIS IS CONCERNED.SECRETARY OF STATE SAID HE BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT IS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR SOME KIND OF CANCELLATION OF NEXT YEAR'S VOTE.HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.ARE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THAT?>> I CAN SEE WHY HE IS SERIOUS ABOUT THAT, AND HERE'S WHY.THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT TRIED TO BASICALLY CANCEL THE 2020 ELECTION BY ENGAGING IN AN EFFORT ON JANUARY 6 TO OVERTURN THE COUNTING OF OUR ELECTORAL VOTES.SO YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK IT TAKES A STRETCH OF IMAGINATION TO WONDER WHETHER THIS IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR SOMETHING BAD.TED: AND AGAIN, YOU TALK ABOUT OUT-OF-CONTROL EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT IS HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING 250 YEARS OF PRECEDENCE.HOW FAR DOES THIS GO, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO BASICALLY, BY WAY OF THE SUPREME COURT DECISION, BELIEVES THAT IF HE MAKES A DECISION.IF HE SAYS NO TO A LOWER COURT'S YES, HE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE IT'S IN THE INTEREST, THE BEST INTEREST AS HE SEES IT FOR THE COUNTRY.>> THE IMMUNITY DECISION WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE WORST DECISIONS EVER MADE BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE TRUTH IS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO HAVE TO DECIDE, IN ALL THESE CASES THAT I'M FILING AND OTHER AGs ARE FILING, WHETHER IT STILL BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION, WHETHER IT STILL BELIEVES IN THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, AND FRANKLY WHETHER IT STILL BELIEVES IN AMERICA?AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT PRETTY SOON.TED: BEFORE YOU GO, YOU'VE GOT A WEBSITE REGARDING SECRETARY OF STATE -- I'M SORRY, SECRETARY OF STATE.SOCIAL SECURITY ISSUES AND THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN INTERESTING.>> BEEN INTERESTING.I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS YET, BUT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT.WE PUT OUT A WEBSITE.WE'RE VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY THE CHANGES HAPPENING INSIDE THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION, SO WE PUT OUT A WEBSITE SAID THAT, HEY, IF YOU'RE SEEING A DISRUPTION IN YOUR CHECK, YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK OR ANYTHING, GIVE US A CALL.LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.TED, WE'VE GOTTEN MORE THAN THREE DOZEN PEOPLE WRITE INTO US WITH SOME KIND OF DISRUPTION THAT THEY'RE SEEING WHETHER IT'S A DELAY IN THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK, WHICH CAN BE CATASTROPHIC FOR SO MANY ARIZONANS WHO LIVE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.OR THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE AT SOCIAL SECURITY, OR THEY'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GOING INTO THE OFFICE, AND THEY'RE BEING HUNG UP ON.THIS IS SCARY STUFF.AND WE'RE JUST NOW GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND TRYING TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT DATA.TED: IS THIS THE KIND OF THING THAT -- WERE THESE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THIS STUFF BEFORE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?>> CERTAINLY DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT.SO WE'LL FIND OUT.AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO DRILL DOWN ON THE DATA.BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE A DISRUPTION TO SOCIAL SECURITY OF SOME KIND, AND, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT ELON MUSK HAS CALLED SOCIAL SECURITY A PONZI SCHEME.WE KNOW D.O.G.E.IS INSIDE SOCIAL SECURITY DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT, AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT.TED: ONCE THE DRILLING IS DONE, WILL THAT BE NUMBER 12?>> IT CERTAINLY COULD BE, BUT IT COULD BE SOME OTHER NUMBER.I DON'T KNOW YET, BUT I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER AGs VERY WORRIED ABOUT IT.TED: ALL RIGHT, ATTORNEY GENERAL KRIS MAYES, GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.ALWAYS A PLEASURE.GOOD DISCUSSION.>> THANK YOU..TED: A NEW EXHIBITION FEATURING ARIZONA ARTIST HIGHLIGHTS THE ARTIST'S DISTINCTIVE TAKE ON A TRADITIONAL MEXICAN CERAMICS TECHNIQUE.IT IS ON DISPLAY AT ROY'S CONTEMPORARY IN OLD TOWN SCOTTSDALE.WE WELCOME HERRERA GARCIA TO "ARIZONA HORIZON.">> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.TED: THE EXHIBIT IS TITLED TALAVERA.>> THE ONLY CERAMIC IN THE REGION IN THE WORLD AND THE TALAVERA, WHERE I MAKE TALAVERA IN PUEBLA, MEXICO, WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE TALAVERA TO HAVE THE DOMINATION OF THE REGION.IT'S A 200 YEAR OLD COMPANY.THE OLDEST TALAVERA COMPANY IN THE WORLD.TED: TALAVERA IS AN AREA OR COMPANY OR BOTH?>> IT'S A COMPANY.TED: A COMPANY, IN A PARTICULAR REGION?>> IN THE CITY OF PUEBLA, MEXICO.TED: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS?>> 2018, THE FOUR SEASONS RESORT REACHED OUT TO ME FOR EXHIBIT WITH THE NAME TALAVERA.WHEN I MET WITH THEM, I TOLD THEM, WE SHOULD HAVE A MEADOW OF TALAVERA.SOMETHING I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO, AND THEY AGREED TO THAT.I WENT FOR A MONTH.I DID THE MURAL FOR THEM, AND THAT BECOME MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MURAL DETALAVERA.TED: IS THIS THE SAME DISPLAY?>> NO, A DIFFERENT ONE.TED: A WALL MURAL, PLATES, THIS IS ALL ON EXHIBIT?>> I HAVE ALL THIS.IT'S LIKE A JAR, BIG ONES.TED: THERE'S THE PAINTING?>> THOSE ARE THE MURALS.>> THE MURALS?OKAY, THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT.WHEN PEOPLE SEE THAT, THEY GO, I KNOW WHAT'S THAT'S ALL ABOUT.YOU'VE GOT A DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT, HUH?>> YOU SEE TALAVERA EVERYWHERE.LIKE THE MEXICAN COLORFUL POTTERY THAT YOU SEE EVERYWHERE.BUT THE WAY THEY DO THOSE ONES ARE CERAMIC.TO BE TALAVERA, HAVE TO BE MADE IN THAT AREA WITH THE SAME TECHNIQUE, THE SAME BRUSHES, THE SAME COLORS.ONLY FIVE COLORS IN THE MAJORCA TECHNIQUE IT.USED TO BE DONE 200 YEARS AGO.TED: HOW DO YOU BLEND THAT OLD WITH YOUR NEW?>> THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THAT.WHEN YOU GO TO A PLACE TO LEARN THIS TECHNIQUE, YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COME WITH ALL YOUR IDEAS, BRUSHES, COLORS IN YOUR MIND FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO PAINT AND THEY STOP YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF TALAVERA.IT IS PUSHING THE LIMIT.CAN I DO THIS?TRY THIS?CAN I ADD THIS IMAGE TO THE TECHNIQUE THEY HAVE ALREADY.THEY'RE THE ONE TELLING YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO.TED: SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE THAT FRAMEWORK, AND YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY COLOR OUTSIDE LINES WHEN YOU'RE FORCED, LIKE WITH POETRY, WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT RHYME, IT OPENS UP THE IMAGINATION, DOESN'T IT?>> THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.THAT'S MY RUSH.TOTALLY MY RUSH, WHEN I'M ABLE TO BLEND THE TWO TECHNIQUES, THE OLD SCHOOL AND MINE, THAT'S THE GOAL.TED: TALK ABOUT OLD SCHOOL AND NEW, WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN AND MEXICAN HERITAGE?HOW DOES THAT ALL WORK WITH THIS?>> I HAD DONE SOME PIECES RELATED TO U.S.IN THE PAST.THERE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE, CHRIS BIANCO HAVE ONE OF THE PIECES IN THE RESTAURANTS.IT'S MADE OF TALAVERA.AMERICAN FLAG BLENDED WITH A MEXICAN FLAG, AND IN THE MIDDLE YOU SEE THE SYMBOL OF MEXICO, THE SYMBOL OF THE SNAKE AND THE AMERICAN FLAG BLENDED WITH THE MEXICAN FLAG, INSTEAD OF THE EAGLE ON THE PALACE, IT'S ON THE SKULLS, AND RELATED TO ALL THAT IN MEXICO BECAUSE OF THE CARTEL.TED: INTERESTING.I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT YOUR INSPIRATION.DO YOU SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE FIRST, OR DO YOU START MAKING IT AND IT APPEARS TO YOU?>> I WANT TO SAY IT'S VERY ORGANIC, THE PROCESS.SOMETIMES IT'S NOT.THE COMBINATION OF COLORS, I SEE PEOPLE, I'M ALWAYS TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TAKE PICTURE OF THEM TO HAVE IT IN MY PORTRAIT, BUT WITH TALAVERA, IT'S DIFFERENT.THERE'S RULES YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW AND A STORY I WANT TO SAY.FOR ME, AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S WHAT I WANT.I WANT TO LEARN THE TECHNIQUE THAT'S SO MEXICAN, FOR ME VERY MEXICAN, WHEN YOU ARE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY THAT'S NOT YOURS, YOU FEEL THE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT YOUR CULTURE, YOU KNOW?AND MORE BECAUSE I HAVE A DAUGHTER AND I WANT TO PASS THAT TO HER.TED: YOU MENTIONED CHRIS BIANCO, HIS RESTAURANTS, EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH PIZZERIA BIANCO, YOU ARE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS TOO, HUH?>> YEAH, I GREW UP IN THE KITCHEN OF MY FAMILY RESTAURANT IN MEXICO, WHEN I WAS A KID, AND I CAME TO AMERICA WITH THE IDEA OF OPENING A RESTAURANT BUT I BECAME AN ARTIST AND IT'S WAY BETTER.BUT 2018, I WAS ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS, WE OPENED TACO CELLO IN ROOSEVELT AND 5th STREET AND WE OPENED THE SECOND LOCATION IN TEMPE.TED: ON COLLEGE.>> YES.TED: SIMILAR MIND-SET WITH CREATING FOOD AND -- >> YES, IT'S ART.THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS MAKE JOKES THAT MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE CHEFS BECAUSE THEY'RE ARTISTS TOO AND WE LOVE TO COLLABORATE.TED: CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SUCCESS, WITH THE ART AND THE EXHIBIT WORLD.TALAVERA,
