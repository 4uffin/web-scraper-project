Professor T is in jail awaiting trial. The hostile, dirty and noisy environment plays havoc with his OCD, plus he is a curiosity among the inmates. But his brilliant criminal mind will soon be put to good use by some of the less than brilliant criminals he finds himself surrounded by.
Professor T is based on the hit Belgian series of the same name.

About Season 2
Professor Jasper Tempest and the team untangle a series of knotty crimes ranging from an unexplained fire in a student block to the mystery of an entire family found dead in their home. Meanwhile, Professor T is dominated and perplexed by the women in his life, from his mother to the love of his life Christina, and his new therapist, Dr. Helena.
About Season 1
Every aspect of Professor Jasper Tempest's life is precisely calibrated and rigidly structured. Impeccably dressed and meticulously punctual, he lectures daily at the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, teaching students imaginatively, if pedantically, about the science of crime. Each evening, he returns home to his apartment, which is as sterile and systematically ordered as a science lab.
But Professor T's buttoned-down world is slowly undone when he is persuaded by one of his former students, Detective Sergeant Lisa Donckers, to assist her in investigating a difficult case. The professor's encyclopaedic knowledge of criminal psychology and his brilliant mind prove invaluable to the under-resourced CID team, but the cracks in his carefully constructed emotionless carapace also begin to show.
