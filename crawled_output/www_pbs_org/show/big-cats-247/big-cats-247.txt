Following the success of Series One, an elite team of wildlife filmmakers returns to Botswana’s breathtaking Okavango Delta to follow the dramatic lives of its big cats, day and night. One of Africa’s last wildernesses, it's a stronghold for lions, cheetahs and leopards.
Read MoreSeries Two sees the return of a familiar cast of human and big cat characters. The expert team of cinematographers — Gordon Buchanan, Anna Dimitriadis, Brad Bestelink, Sets Nthomiwa, Rea Schulte to Brinke, Greg Hartman and Tristen Woodward — live and work together from the Natural History Film Unit, Botswana’s remote film camp in the heart of big cat territory.
Together, they follow the twists and turns in the lives of key, named big cats, introduced in Series One. Across five vital months, cats — and humans — battle punishing seasonal change, from flood to extreme drought. Over brutal terrain, in searing temperatures and through day and night, the team keeps its cameras rolling 24/7 to capture unparalleled, unseen animal behavior.
State-of-the-art thermal cameras, and the latest in drone technology, mean the team can film the cats from the ground, the air and, uniquely, through the night, revealing yet more brand-new insights into their lives.
This series transports audiences into the heart of an area almost entirely free from human influence. Alongside some of the continent’s most trusted experts and accomplished cinematographers, we are immersed into the endeavor of the filming process, and most importantly, into the extraordinary lives of the Okavango Delta’s big cats.
