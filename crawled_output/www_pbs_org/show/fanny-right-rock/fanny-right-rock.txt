As young women who expertly played their own instruments, Fanny bandmates penned original songs that were ahead of their time, with lyrics exploring themes of sexual freedom, war, relationships and identity.

Despite roadblocks of misogyny and bigotry, Fanny released Top 40 hits and five critically acclaimed albums between 1970 to 1974, counting David Bowie as one of their most vocal fans. They toured extensively across the USA and abroad with bands like Chicago, Steely Dan, Slade and Ike & Tina Turner, yet Fanny's ground-breaking impact in music was lost in the mists of time… until bandmates reunite 50 years later with a new rock record deal, and chance to right the wrongs of history.
The film follows Fanny's rise, fall and revivification, featuring rare performance archives, photographs and eye-opening interviews about the band's impact and history with music icons including Bonnie Raitt, Todd Rundgren, The Go Go's Kathy Valentine, Def Leppard's Joe Elliott, The Runaways' Cherie Currie, Charles Neville, The B52s Kate Pierson, Lovin’ Spoonful’s John Sebastian as well as David Bowie lead guitarist Earl Slick and bassist Gail Ann Dorsey. This multi award-winning film celebrates Fanny's often-forgotten legacy in rock music. Meet the most important band you've never heard of... yet.
