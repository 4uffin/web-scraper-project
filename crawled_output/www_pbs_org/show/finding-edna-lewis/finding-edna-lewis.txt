She introduced many Americans to seasonal cooking, Southern cooking—the cooking of the Black community in rural Virginia that raised her. Yet even though her life included fame and acclaim, she is not a household name.
Read MoreIn FINDING EDNA LEWIS, Deb Freeman travels to the places where Miss Lewis made her mark, and where her legacy endures. Deb interviews—and cooks!—with chefs, farmers, cookbook writers, and family members whose approach to food was profoundly shaped by Miss Lewis.
Decades before culture celebrated chefs as celebrities, and often behind-the-scenes as a Black woman working in food, Miss Lewis appears in little archival footage. But Deb discovers Miss Lewis again and again, cooking dishes from her repertoire and talking to those who knew her and her food best. She finds not only an enigmatic chef, but also an essential American personality—a champion of seasonal, local, farm-to-table cooking whose life reveals deep truths about the tables we set.
