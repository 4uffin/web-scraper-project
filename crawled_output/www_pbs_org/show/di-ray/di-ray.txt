Two months after her suspension from the force, D.I. Rachita Ray returns to homicide to investigate the brutal shooting of a young nurse and the head of a notorious crime syndicate outside a Birmingham hospital. The shooting sends shockwaves throughout the city. All signs point to a gangland turf war, but as DI Ray begins to pull at the threads, new evidence comes to light that suggest a far more complex mystery.

When D.I. Rachita Ray, a British Asian policewoman new to homicide is assigned to investigate the suspected honor killing of a young Muslim man, she quickly realizes the suspects can't be guilty. The evidence against the two brothers from a British Hindu family is flimsy at best. Her attempts at conveying this to her superiors and her colleagues fall on deaf ears, hidden biases and a keenness to wrap the case up mean no one is listening to her.
That is until her probing leads the team to a much more sinister crime. In this four-part drama, D.I. Ray goes on a journey that sees her uncover a complex web of deceit within organized crime, whilst laying bare the wounds deep within herself that she's spent a lifetime ignoring. Wounds that are born from a desperate desire to "fit in," despite not looking the part.
