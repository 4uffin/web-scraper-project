Our journey so far​​In 2009, Max Lytvyn, Alex Shevchenko, and Dmytro Lider founded Grammarly. Their goal was to help people write and communicate more effectively. Their first version of Grammarly was a subscription-based product focused on grammar and spelling for students. However, they soon saw that Grammarly's potential was far beyond the initial product.Since then, we’ve continued to grow our communication assistance capabilities. Grammarly uses the latest advancements in AI and machine learning to analyze complex aspects of language and generate ideas and drafts, making it an all-in-one writing partner for professional writing.
Today, Grammarly offers an intuitive, real-time interface for people wherever they type—whether you want your AI writing assistance on your desktop, mobile, or across websites on your browser.Our journey doesn’t end here.
