It’s freeContact SalesLog inWelcome to Agentic AI 101A beginner-friendly guide to a fast-moving field. No technical background required.We’re breaking down the basics of agentic AI: what it is, what sets agents apart from the AI you’re used to, and how organizations are already putting it to work. Think of this as your first course in a rapidly evolving field that will evolve as the technology advances.Table of contents• Agentic AI explained• AI agent building blocks• AI agent differentiators• Key features of enterprise AI agents• The agentic AI gradient• Where AI agents are already at work• How we got here• Key terms you need to know• Meet the experts behind the insightsAgentic AI explainedAgentic AI is a new class of AI that doesn’t just suggest or assist—it acts. AI agents are autonomous or semi-autonomous software entities that can detect, make decisions, and take action to accomplish goals in digital environments. Agentic AI understands your goals, accesses the tools and data you give it permission to use, and takes initiative to help you move faster, work smarter, and amplify your impact.
In plain terms: Generative AI responds. Agentic AI gets things done—no prompting required.AI agent building blocksAgents on a modern platform share three core attributes: They combine knowledge, skills, and assignments to achieve goals—sometimes with you, sometimes for you.Knowledge: What AI agents knowAI agents must have secure access to the data and documents needed to complete their tasks—whether from your company’s internal systems, enterprise tools, or third-party sources.Skills: What AI agents can doAI agents don’t just generate content—they perform actions: rewriting text, triggering workflows, annotating docs, and more. These skills are what make agents powerful partners, not just clever copilots.Assignments: What agents are tasked withAI agents are embedded into workflows, not siloed in chat. They know when to show up, how to engage with you, and what interface elements to use.AI agent differentiatorsThere are four key traits that make agents fundamentally different from the AI you’re used to.AI agents are proactiveAI agents don’t wait for prompts—they anticipate needs. They notice when you’re drafting an email, preparing for a meeting, or managing a backlog, and they appear in the flow of your work to help.Whether it’s suggesting a rewrite, surfacing key insights, or kicking off a workflow, they take initiative to keep work moving.AI agents are context awareAI agents understand your task, your tools, your team, and your goals. They don’t offer generic help. They tailor their actions based on what you’re working on and how you work, drawing on past behavior and current context.The result: smarter support, fewer distractions.AI agents are collaborativeAI agents aren’t here to replace you—they’re here to work with you. They take on the repetitive, time-consuming parts of your job while keeping you firmly in control.You review, approve, and build on their contributions—like working with a teammate who already knows your style and intent.AI agents are permission awareThis is what makes the more sophisticated AI agents enterprise-ready. They operate within the access permissions determined by their users. For instance, you can allow agents to access knowledge and data appropriate to the employee's role, such as a sales target, but not sensitive information.That makes them not just powerful, but trustworthy.Generative AIAI assistantsAgentic AIPrimary functionGenerate contentRespond to tasks or promptsAct toward goals with contextual awarenessInteraction stylePrompt-basedConversational, assistiveProactive, autonomous, and continuously evolvingAutonomyLowMedium, rule-basedHigh, outcome-orientedEnvironmentStand-alone, prompt-based toolsPre-integrated tools or platformsIntegrated across systems and workflowsMemoryMinimal, session-basedLimited, often short-termPersistent and adaptive memory that informs behaviorPlanning abilityNoneReactive logicMultistep reasoning and dynamic decision-makingOutputOne-time results, like text or imagesTask-based supportGoal-driven outcomesKey features of enterprise AI agentsAI agents show up where you work, understand what matters, and drive outcomes across systems.Ubiquity: AI agents work where you do, so you can stay in flow instead of constantly context switching.Your agent should be embedded across your workflow—email, docs, Slack, Zendesk—not exclusively trapped in a tab.Contextual intelligence: AI agents understand what matters, so you save time while getting smarter, more relevant outputs.Real help requires real understanding. Agents should understand your goals, brand, audience, voice, and tone—without needing explicit instructions every time.Orchestration: AI agents coordinate across systems, which improves their value and their reach.Real work spans tools and systems. Agents should operate across apps, triggering actions and passing context fluidly—like a teammate, not a tool.Making Sense of Agentic AI TrendsFeeling overwhelmed by agentic AI? You’re not alone—but the good news is, you don’t have to understand everything about AI agents to make smart decisions.This webinar is your shortcut to clarity (and calm). Led by experts from G2 and Grammarly, this conversation is designed to help you zero in on the agentic AI trends that will shape business, strategies, and ways of working.Watch the conversationThe agentic AI gradientNot all AI agents are created equal. This gradient shows how agents evolve from simple support tools to complex, autonomous systems.Why a gradient?Not every task needs a system of AI agents—and that’s the point. Some problems call for simple, prompt-based tools. Others need coordination across teams, tools, and data. The agentic gradient helps you match the right level of agent to the complexity of your task—from lightweight copilots to fully autonomous systems. It’s about using the right AI for the job.Think of it like driving: Copilots are like Waze’s GPS suggestions, while multi-agent systems are more like Waymo’s autonomous vehicles. The higher you go on the gradient, the more trust and coordination are required.Listen to Tim Sanders, VP of Research Insights at G2, break down the agent gradient.Where AI agents are already at workAgentic AI isn’t theoretical—it’s already powering real work. Here’s how enterprise teams are using agents across the gradient to save time, reduce friction, and accelerate work.Marketing scenarioPriya, a demand generation manager, is writing an email for a product launch and needs a quick starting point based on existing messaging.

H2 PlansThe Shift From Systems of Record to Systems of ActionHow AI Agent Collaboration Will Unlock Enterprise ImpactWhy Intuitive Interfaces Will Drive Agentic AI ROIGoal Engineering Is the Next Must-Have AI SkillFrequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the difference between agentic AI and generative AI?Generative AI tools are reactive—they wait for you to prompt them and respond with content like texts, images, and code. Agentic AI is different. It doesn’t just generate—it acts. Agents take initiative based on your goals, understand your context, and work within your systems to move work forward within the guardrails you set. Instead of being siloed in a chat interface, they show up where you work and collaborate with you to get things done. In plain terms: Generative AI responds. Agentic AI gets things done—no prompting required.What is an example of agentic AI?Imagine a customer success manager (CSM) preparing for an important customer meeting. Instead of the CSM having to jump between tools, an AI agent gathers recent support tickets, product usage data, and sentiment from past emails. It then drafts a personalized quarterly business review deck, complete with insights and recommendations, ready for the CSM’s review. That’s agentic AI in action: pulling context, making decisions, and driving outcomes, all without you needing to prompt it.How do AI agents work?AI agents combine knowledge (what they know), skills (what they can do), and assignments (what they’re told to do). They access systems and record, make decisions, and take action—all within the permissions you set. This enables them to execute tasks or coordinate workflows with minimal prompting needed.How can I start using agentic AI in my organization?Begin by identifying repetitive or high-impact tasks that could benefit from automation. Then explore platforms that support agentic capabilities—especially those that integrate with your existing tools and prioritize security, flexibility, and enterprise control.What are the benefits of agentic AI?Agentic AI offers notable benefits to businesses, including improved operational excellence, reduced costs, and a unique competitive advantage.Cost savings: By automating complex, repeatable tasks without constant input, agentic AI cuts costs while maintaining quality and scalability.
