The continued Russian attacks are horrific atrocities that have caused immense suffering, fear, heartbreak, and devastation. We are a company with a deep connection to Ukraine. Grammarly was founded in Ukraine; our co-founders are from Ukraine, and we have many team members who call Ukraine home. To our colleagues, friends, family, and all the people of Ukraine, know that we stand with you, completely and wholeheartedly, and are sending aid. We are in awe of Ukraine’s resilience, bravery, and unbreakable spirit under these unimaginable circumstances.
What you can doWe are grateful to the many people and organizations that have joined us in taking action. We ask for whatever help you can offer, whether that is by peacefully protesting, speaking to your representatives, or donating money. The demand for war relief is high—and so is the need to sustain hope. Below are links to some trustworthy organizations in need of funds to continue supporting and caring for the people of Ukraine and saving lives:UNITED24 →The Come Back Alive Fund →Nova Ukraine →Razom →Hospitallers →What Grammarly is doingSince 2022, Grammarly has donated over $6 million—more than the equivalent of the net revenue generated from the usage of Grammarly’s product in Russia and Belarus since 2014—to organizations and funds supporting the people of Ukraine. We have leveraged the power of community to increase our impact and are grateful to everyone who has joined us, including the donors worldwide who contributed to our fundraiser with the UNITED24 platform to purchase much-needed ambulances in Ukraine. We continue offering Grammarly’s paid features for free* to all Ukrainian nonprofits, NGOs, and media organizations; we’re grateful for their heroic efforts and are humbled to help how we can. We have also blocked users located in Russia and Belarus from using Grammarly products or services.

Support team.Information you can trustThere is a lot of misinformation circulating about what is going on in Ukraine. Misleading images and videos as well as false news stories continue to surface online. We urge you to rely only on credible, fact-checked sources to stay informed.
It is our hope that the war ends soon with the recognition of Ukraine as a free and independent nation.
