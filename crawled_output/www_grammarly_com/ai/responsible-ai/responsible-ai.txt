We leverage AI and other technologies only to address actual challenges people face in communicating their ideas and being understood as intended.Developing a product with intentionWe build products and models with checks and balances to prioritize privacy, safety, and fairness. We rigorously evaluate our work to anticipate its impact on our users and communities.Safeguarding user data and trustPeople trust us with their words, and we earn their trust by putting data security and privacy at the core of our business and our product. With 15 years of experience developing best-in-class AI communication assistance, we will always go to great lengths to ensure user data is encrypted, private, and secure. Users can control whether their content is used to improve our models, and we do not allow any partners or third parties to use our customers’ content to train their models or improve their products.Ensuring user autonomyWe put users in control of their experience. AI is a tool that helps augment communication, but it can’t do everything. People are the ultimate decision-makers and experts in their own relationships and areas of expertise. Our commitment is to help every user communicate effectively and reach their full potential. We give users the context to choose whether to accept or reject a suggestion, and users can always choose to turn off various AI features.

When defining our responsible AI guiding principles, we began with our commitment to safeguarding users’ thoughts and words. By considering industry guidelines, user feedback, and expert consultations, we established our guiding pillars: transparency, fairness, user agency, accountability, and privacy and security. These themes serve as our North Star, guiding everything we build.For more information, download Grammarly’s Responsible AI white paper.What process does Grammarly use to evaluate the risks associated with developing AI features?Grammarly has a comprehensive AI risk assessment process for launching new AI products and features. This process evaluates potential issues related to privacy, security, fairness, safety and the overall implications of these features, including their potential for abuse.The Grammarly Responsible AI (RAI) team is hands-on with product development, extending beyond other responsible AI teams that may focus primarily on research or policy decisions. We have developed a sophisticated machine learning solution combined with human review to assess new features. The RAI team is involved in every feature that is shipped. Each feature receives a risk categorization according to criteria developed by our team, and launches are not approved unless the recommended mitigations are implemented.For more information, download Grammarly’s Responsible AI white paper. You can visit Grammarly’s Trust Center to learn about our user-first approach to privacy and security.What are ways in which Grammarly fosters user agency?At Grammarly, we believe AI should enhance team skills while respecting personal autonomy. Users should always be in control of their interactions with AI.To promote transparent and responsible AI use, Grammarly empowers users to take control of the AI suggestions it offers. Users have the option to accept or dismiss these suggestions, and Grammarly provides explanations to help users make informed decisions about whether to incorporate a suggestion into their writing. Additionally, users can customize the types of suggestions they receive through their settings. Our commitment is to empower every user to use AI to communicate as effectively as possible.For more information, download Grammarly’s Responsible AI white paper.What is Grammarly’s approach to embracing accountability in responsible AI development?Grammarly is committed to responsible AI accountability in multiple ways. One such example is by actively acknowledging and addressing gender bias in our autocorrect features, the learnings of which we shared openly on our company blog. We continuously monitor model performance to ensure our products meet our responsible AI standards. This commitment to ongoing improvement reflects our accountability in designing AI that supports fair and unbiased communication for all users.In addition to our rigorous risk assessment process, we have a robust support team that collects instances of adverse model outcomes. This allows us to review and iterate on incorrect or harmful information our product might generate. We understand that our users rely on us to ensure the suggestions are helpful, and our team works hard to ensure that we take ownership and accountability when we get it wrong.For more information, download Grammarly’s Responsible AI white paper.What are ways in which Grammarly preserves privacy and security?One of the most important pillars of responsible AI is upholding privacy and security to protect all users, customers, and their companies’ reputations.

We never sell user content, either.In addition, we maintain a thorough vendor review process, repeated regularly, to conduct due diligence before engaging with any processors and subprocessors. At Grammarly, much of our security work is focused on preventing adversarial attacks on our users. We rely on a red team of experts with experience on both sides of the security fence to identify adversarial security approaches and vulnerabilities and help us formulate mitigation strategies that help keep our product safe.For more information, please visit Grammarly’s Trust Center to learn about our user-first approach to privacy and security.What actions is Grammarly taking to assess and mitigate bias in its generative AI models to avoid potential harm, ensure fairness and equity, and promote responsible and ethical use?We have implemented automated measures to evaluate quality, fairness, and safety in our AI products. We aim to resolve any high-severity issues we discover so that they do not appear to our users. Furthermore, we monitor user feedback and regularly conduct human evaluations so we can continually improve our approach.At Grammarly, we build our models with safety and fairness as a priority, from how we sample and label data to how we train models, design prompts for large language models, and post-process AI output. We use a combination of technologies to filter AI suggestions to minimize potentially harmful content and ensure our products engage with user texts appropriately. Our proprietary machine learning content-filtering solution is specifically designed to prevent our models from interacting with user texts in contexts that could potentially cause harm.
What are the potential limitations of generative AI systems?Generative AI systems have several inherent limitations and risks, including AI hallucinations, misinformation, bias, and potential security and privacy risks.These limitations highlight the importance of developing responsible AI systems whose goal is to address and mitigate these risks. Grammarly’s Research and Engineering teams are dedicated to continuously enhancing AI solutions by refining models to better understand the nuances of language and context while remaining keenly aware of the limitations of AI. Our approach to responsible AI development enables us to help organizations that are using Grammarly’s AI tools avoid ethical dilemmas that may arise from using AI in scenarios where it could cause harm.These limitations highlight the critical role of human judgment, especially when dealing with complex or sensitive material.
