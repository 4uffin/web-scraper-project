Where can I use Grammarly’s sentence checker?You can use the sentence checker on this page. Or you can download Grammarly to get AI-powered writing assistance on all of your sentences. Grammarly works in your browser, across all of your favorite desktop apps, and on your phone.What are run-on sentences, and how can I avoid them?Run-on sentences are a type of grammar mistake that happens when two or more clauses are joined incorrectly. You can fix run-on sentences by adding a semicolon or a conjunction with a comma between the clauses. Or you can simply split the sentence into two or more separate sentences.What are sentence fragments, and how can I improve them?A complete sentence needs both a subject and a verb. When one of those is missing, you end up with a sentence fragment. It's OK to use sentence fragments in casual writing, but it's best to stick to complete sentences in more formal situations.How can I strengthen my sentence structure?One of the best ways to check your sentence structure is to read it out loud. If you get lost partway through or find yourself tripping over certain phrases, you can try rewriting your sentence or breaking it into simpler ones.Does Grammarly offer other free AI writing tools?Yes!
