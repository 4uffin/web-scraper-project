The process typically works as follows:Input your text: You paste your AI-generated text into the tool.AI analysis: The humanizer scans the writing for AI-specific patterns (e.g., overly formal tone or repetitive phrasing).Rewriting: It rephrases sentences and adjusts wording and tone to make your writing sound more natural and fluent.Output: You receive an updated version of the text that reads as if a human wrote it, with the original meaning preserved.Why would I benefit from humanizing AI-generated text?AI-generated text can be a great starting point, but a humanized touch can go the extra mile in making it sound less like AI. Humanizing your text can improve flow, clarity, and word choice, making your writing more engaging and easier for people to read and understand.Does using the humanizer change the meaning of my text?No—the humanizer is designed to keep your original meaning intact. It rephrases your wording to improve clarity and flow, but it doesn’t add or remove ideas. You’ll get the same message, expressed in a more natural and readable way.How does AI humanization work with AI detection?AI-generated text often includes patterns, phrases, or stylistic choices that can be recognized by AI detection systems. Grammarly’s AI humanizer refines this text to sound more natural by improving clarity, tone, and flow; it does not aim to bypass detection.That said, humanized text may alter or remove features that are commonly flagged as AI-generated. If you’re working in a context where it’s important to disclose how your writing was created—such as academic, journalistic, or professional settings—we recommend being transparent about the use of AI and humanizers. To support this, Grammarly offers Authorship, which clarifies where and how AI contributed to your writing. It gives you and your audience visibility into which parts of the text were written by you and which were generated or refined by AI, helping you communicate with integrity and build trust. Learn more about Grammarly Authorship here.Is using an AI humanizer cheating or plagiarism?It depends on the context of your writing task. In many professional settings, using AI tools to draft or polish content is appropriate—and increasingly common. Tools like Grammarly’s AI humanizer can help refine AI-generated text so it’s clearer, more natural, and easier to read.However, in academic settings or any context where AI use is restricted or must be disclosed, using an AI humanizer to disguise the use of AI may be considered unethical and could constitute cheating or plagiarism. Grammarly encourages transparency and integrity in all forms of communication, and we recommend citing AI when in doubt.To help support responsible writing practices, Grammarly includes features that promote academic and professional integrity, such as:Citations – To properly attribute sources and disclose any AI assistance.Authorship support – To help you and your audience clearly see where your words originated.Plagiarism and AI detection – To check your content for potential plagiarism and AI-generated text, so you can feel confident you’re submitting original work.Does Grammarly offer other AI-powered tools?Yes, Grammarly offers a suite of free AI-powered writing tools to support a wide range of writing tasks.
