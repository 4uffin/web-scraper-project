Our machine-learning model is trained on hundreds of thousands of human and AI-generated texts. Grammarly breaks your text into smaller sections, checking each section against the model for language patterns typically indicative of AI text. Grammarly then returns a % score, indicating how much of the provided text appears AI-generated. It assesses whether text resembles AI-generated writing; like other AI text checkers, it cannot provide a definitive conclusion.
To learn more, visit our support page.Do AI detectors actually work?While AI detectors can help assess whether text appears to be AI-generated, currently there is no AI detector that can conclusively or definitively determine whether AI was used to produce text. That’s because the accuracy of these tools can vary based on the algorithms used and the specific characteristics of the text being analyzed. AI detection tools should be just one part of a holistic approach to evaluating writing originality. If you're seeking a more detailed and reliable way to prove the originality of your work or show your writing process more clearly, try Grammarly Authorship. Authorship automatically categorizes your text as you write based on where it came from. Unlike traditional AI detectors, which analyze and estimate the likelihood that text is AI-generated or plagiarized post-submission, Authorship works by using Grammarly’s on-browser presence and access to your clipboard (with your consent) to label text that is typed, copied from an AI-generated source, copied from a website, rephrased with Grammarly’s AI, or edited with grammar and spelling corrections. With Authorship, you also receive a shareable report, ideal for sharing with professors, supervisors, or editors. Plus, Authorship’s replay feature allows you to review your document's creation from the first word to the final punctuation mark, providing an additional layer of validation for your writing process.Can AI checkers be biased?Yes, AI content detectors can be biased. They may misinterpret writing styles and flag content as less authentic—especially with writers whose primary language is not English. This happens because AI often learns from a majority-language pattern, which might not account for the diverse ways people write.
That’s why Grammarly is committed to building models using quality datasets that undergo comprehensive evaluations for bias and fairness. We design and develop products with our team of analytical linguists who apply their research and expertise to minimize bias and apply user feedback.
Learn more about our principles of responsible AI development.Is Grammarly’s AI content detector accurate?No AI detector is 100% accurate. This means you should never rely on the results of an AI detector alone to determine whether AI was used to generate content. AI detectors can indicate characteristics found in human-written text as well as characteristics commonly found in AI-generated writing, such as language patterns that seem robotic or generic. But, they cannot definitively conclude whether or not AI was used. These tools should be one part of a holistic approach to evaluating writing originality. Can ChatGPT be detected?Yes, Grammarly’s AI detector and other ChatGPT checkers can identify text produced by AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Microsoft Copilot, and more. To learn more about all things AI, visit the Grammarly blog.Why is my writing flagged for AI?Your writing might be flagged for AI if it exhibits patterns, structures, or characteristics typical of text that has been created with generative AI. Learn more about why your writing may have been flagged on the Grammarly blog.Where does Grammarly’s AI content detection feature work?Grammarly's AI content detection feature is currently available for Grammarly Premium, Grammarly Business, and Grammarly for Education subscribers. Use it in Grammarly for Windows and Mac and the Grammarly Editor.
It will soon become available for more of our product offerings, enabling you to check your text across even more applications and websites. The AI detector tool on this page is compatible with any browser. For guidance on getting started with Grammarly's AI detection feature, visit our support page.Is using AI considered cheating?What is and is not cheating can be subjective—what one professor considers acceptable might be off-limits to another. It also varies based on the assignment and how you intend to use AI. When writing in an academic setting, always comply with your institution’s and educator’s AI usage policies, typically found in course syllabi or academic-integrity guidelines.
If you use AI, we recommend you disclose it with a citation. Grammarly can instantly generate citations for AI usage when you use AI tools. Does Grammarly offer other free AI writing tools?Yes! Grammarly provides a range of AI-powered writing tools, including:Grammar Checker—Catch and correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes.Plagiarism Checker—Detect potential plagiarism and add citations.Cover Letter Generator—Quickly create professional cover letters.AI Content Detector—Identify AI-generated text in your writing.How does Grammarly’s AI detector work?Grammarly’s AI detector is built to encourage thoughtful and responsible AI use. Writers can use it to get a gut check on how their content comes across and identify places where adding a more personal voice might strengthen their message. Readers, in turn, can use the detection results to better understand how a piece of writing may have been created.When a document is scanned, Grammarly segments the text and analyzes each section for language patterns that are often linked to AI-generated writing. Our detection model was trained on tens of thousands of texts, including both human-written and AI-generated text created before 2021. This training enables it to recognize key differences between the two. Based on this analysis, Grammarly generates a percentage score estimating how much of the content may have been generated by AI.To learn more about how AI detectors work, check out our in-depth blog article. What is the difference between AI detectors and plagiarism checkers?AI detectors and plagiarism checkers are both used to evaluate content originality, but they serve different purposes and analyze text in distinct ways.AI detectorsPurpose: Estimate whether a piece of text was generated by AI.How they work: Analyze writing patterns, predictability, and structure to determine the likelihood of AI authorship.What they detect: Content that may have been created using AI tools.Reliability: Results are probabilistic and can sometimes misidentify human-written or AI-generated content.Plagiarism checkersPurpose: Identify whether text matches existing published sources.How they work: Compare the text against databases of books, articles, web pages, and academic papers.What they detect: Copied or improperly cited content, including exact matches.Reliability: Generally more accurate, but may not catch paraphrased or reworded plagiarism.Why use both?Since AI-generated content and plagiarism are distinct issues, using both tools together gives you a more complete picture of originality.To learn more about AI detector accuracy, check out our in-depth blog article.Essential resources for academic integrityGrammarly's AI Resources for StudentsHow AI Can Help You With Your AssignmentsAI for Homework?
