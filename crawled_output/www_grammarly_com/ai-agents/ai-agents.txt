They are task-specific, and each specializes in a different aspect. Work with one agent at a time—right when you need it. You may end up using all the agents for your project.How do AI agents use my data?When you ask agents for help, they rely on the context of your document to make useful suggestions, and the data in your working environment is only temporarily stored while they do so.Will agents remember what I write?Agents do not retain information between sessions or across different agents. While they can use what you write during a single interaction to provide helpful, in-the-moment guidance, they won’t remember details after the session ends.
The only exception is your voice profile, which you can create by uploading a writing sample, if you wish. This snapshot helps agents better match your writing style.Learn how Grammarly transforms communication through AIBuilt with over a decade of linguistic expertise and AI innovation, Grammarly addresses your biggest communication challenges.AI at GrammarlyLearn how our AI streamlines collaboration, boosts productivity, and makes sure your writing is always clear, effective, and impactful—without compromising your creativity.Learn moreResponsible AIAt Grammarly, we’re guided by the belief that AI should enhance people’s skills while respecting personal autonomy and amplifying the intelligence, strengths, and impact of every writer.Learn moreDo your best work with GrammarlyJoin 40 million people and 50,000 organizations who use Grammarly to transform their writing every day.Sign up
