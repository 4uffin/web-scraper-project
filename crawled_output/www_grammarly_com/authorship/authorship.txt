However, Grammarly Authorship provides greater detail and insight to help you demonstrate your work’s originality.AI detectors check if any of your writing seems to be AI-generated based on language patterns commonly found in AI-created writing. They don’t keep track of document history; they just analyze your text in a moment in time.Grammarly Authorship, meanwhile, helps you keep track of version history and where text in your writing came from. It doesn’t just show you where you used AI; it also identifies if sentences were written by you or came from a website, a Grammarly suggestion, or a non-web source.
In addition, Authorship creates an originality report you can share with your professor, boss, or editor. It also lets you replay your document’s creation from the first word to the last punctuation mark so you can double-check your process.How can I use Authorship as a faculty member? As a professor or TA, you can use Authorship to gauge the originality of students’ work. By asking students to include an Authorship report when they submit assignments, you can ensure they are using and citing sources—including AI—appropriately.
Here are a few best practices you can follow when using Authorship or any other originality checker:
- Instead of using Authorship to penalize students, use it as an opportunity to proactively discuss how students should use AI and cite sources.
- Use the circle graph at the top of the report to quickly gauge the student’s sources and process.
- Do a deep dive into the report or replay the document history if you have concerns.
- Use Authorship replays as a starting point for discussing how to draft, revise, and cite work.
