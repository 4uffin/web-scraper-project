Smartsheet offers work management solutions that help individuals and teams become high achievers. Used by nonprofit organizations, small businesses, and more than 85% of Fortune 500 companies worldwide, Smartsheet helps its clients develop products, run campaigns, and manage their work productively.
Keeping up with overflowing communication channels
Smartsheet is dedicated to helping its organizations drive productivity and efficiency at scale. As champions of these values, Smartsheet’s Customer Success team is on the frontlines, supporting clients through constant communication with cross-functional colleagues and customers alike. This fast-paced, high-touch environment requires clear, concise, and professional communication across email, chat, and multiple other channels—all while maintaining the brand’s high standards for empathy and professionalism.
“Effective communication is foundational to strong business,” says Chris Dowse, Smartsheet’s SVP of Business Value. “When you’re involved in a customer interaction, you have to factor in things like professionalism, empathy, and brand consistency.”
However, as customer communications increased in volume, frequency, and urgency, meeting these standards posed a significant challenge for the team. To meet their customer’s needs, Smartsheet sought a solution that would improve productivity and deepen customer engagement without sacrificing quality.
Investing in AI to empower Customer Success teams
As Smartsheet sought better tools to manage their communication workload, the Customer Success team specifically asked for Grammarly. As the team responsible for helping customers maximize the platform’s value, their ability to communicate effectively and efficiently was critical and they knew Grammarly was the right tool for the job. “Our employees are massive fans—Grammarly is in that class of technologies in which the individual benefit means something to them,” Dowse said.
Grammarly’s AI writing assistance integrates into the tools that Dowse’s Success team uses daily, empowering them to craft effective internal and external communications with speed and confidence.
“If I’ve got 20 customer emails to send, it’s not nearly as daunting a task knowing that I can do that faster and with high quality and confidence because I have Grammarly,” said Brian Bolduc, Senior Strategic Customer Success Manager at Smartsheet.
“Our employees are massive fans. Grammarly is in that class of technologies in which the individual benefit means something to them.”

Bolduc and his colleagues also rely on Grammarly’s real-time, in-line writing suggestions to ensure all messages are clear, concise, and aligned with Smartsheet’s tone and style—even in fast-paced channels like Slack. “If I’ve got an important question from a customer, I can send it to a cross-functional team in Slack,” Bolduc said. “Grammarly ensures that the question is written so that it’s easily understood, and that makes it easy for someone on another team to answer.”
The team also leverages Grammarly’s generative AI to accelerate productivity by streamlining time-consuming tasks, such as drafting agendas for regular meetings. With these tools, Smartsheet’s Customer Success team is empowered to deliver exceptional customer service while staying productive under growing demands.
Saving time, reducing costs, and driving 283% ROI
Smartsheet regularly assesses the value of its technology investments, and Grammarly Business has proven to deliver exceptional results. A recent analysis found that the combination of Grammarly’s in-line writing assistance and AI prompts saves Smartsheet’s staff approximately 1,600 hours annually—time that is reinvested in higher-value, revenue-generating activities.
But the value goes far beyond efficiency. “You get so much more than improving sentence structure and grammar,” Bolduc said. “Grammarly considers the purpose behind what you’re writing so that the final product matches your intent.”
What’s more, adopting Grammarly allowed the company to sunset another platform previously used for corporate style guide compliance. The combination of significant time savings and reduced software costs resulted in 283% ROI on Smartsheet’s use of Grammarly.
Dowse also highlighted broader qualitative benefits. “It’s not just that people are able to get assets out to the broader organization more quickly,” he said. “There’s also a benefit of avoiding brand risk or non-compliance with customer contracts.”
As the volume of business communications—and the channels used to share them—grows, Smartsheet is planning to expand Grammarly across the organization. “As a communication platform, Grammarly helps cut through all the noise and be more effective,” said Dowse. “There’s power in that.”
