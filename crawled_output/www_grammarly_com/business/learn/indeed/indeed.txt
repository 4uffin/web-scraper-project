Indeed is a global leader in the employment sector, providing a platform for millions of job seekers and employers to connect. With almost 11,000 employees worldwide, Indeed operates across multiple regions, offering services that help job seekers search for opportunities, build resumes, and research potential employers. The company is dedicated to ensuring an inclusive, accessible work environment and employs AI-powered tools to streamline the hiring process for both job seekers and businesses.
Challenge
Indeed faced several communication challenges due to its large and diverse workforce, particularly when maintaining consistent, clear, and inclusive messaging. Many employees, especially those from non-native English backgrounds, struggled with writing confidence, which led to lengthy revision times. Moreover, the company’s 44-page inclusive language style guide existed as a static document, making it difficult for employees to consistently adhere to inclusive language principles in their day-to-day communications. This also impacted content creation, as maintaining a cohesive tone and voice across teams and channels became time-consuming.
Solution
Indeed turned to Grammarly, quickly implementing their inclusive language guide via Grammarly’s Style Guide feature, ensuring the terminology was available in real time wherever writing occurs. Employees now receive immediate suggestions related to language and inclusivity in-line, wherever they write, ensuring that content and communications are not only accurate but also aligned with company values.
Results
Adopting Grammarly has led to remarkable improvements in writing efficiency and content quality. On average, users saved 43 minutes per day by reducing the time spent on revisions. This has resulted in an impressive 86x ROI in reclaimed time alone. Within a few months, 72% of written communication was improved with suggestions from Grammarly– made directly in the flow of work– furnishing a consistent tone and clear messaging, and accelerating the learning curve for those adopting English as an additional language. Moreover, Grammarly’s seamless integration with DEI guidelines contributed to more inclusive communications internally and externally, with real-time feedback helping teams adopt best practices.
The integration of Grammarly into our daily workflow has allowed us to streamline content creation, reduce editing time, and make our communications clearer and more inclusive. It’s a powerful tool for supporting our diverse workforce.
