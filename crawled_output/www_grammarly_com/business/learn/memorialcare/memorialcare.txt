MemorialCare is a leading nonprofit health system in Southern California, with a robust network of hospitals, medical groups, imaging centers, and surgical centers. Focused on improving patient care, MemorialCare serves the diverse communities of Orange County and Los Angeles County. As the organization continues to expand, it strives to maintain a high communication standard while ensuring the well-being of its employees and patients.
Challenge
As MemorialCare’s workforce grew, the organization struggled to maintain clear, professional, and consistent communication across departments. They needed a solution to improve written communication, and it was essential to find a solution that met their high IT governance and security standards. Plus, as with any new tool, they needed to demonstrate clear ROI to prove its necessity.
MemorialCare’s IT department, led by Senior Software Compliance Manager Terolyn Phinsee, sought a solution to meet compliance standards, ensure data protection, and help foster inclusive, high-quality communication practices to deliver the best possible patient experience.
Solution
MemorialCare adopted Grammarly’s enterprise product to address its needs, providing a unified solution that supports its commitment to high-quality communication and security. Initially, Phinsee discovered that over 80 employees were already using Grammarly without going through the established procurement process, so she worked with Grammarly’s team to centralize these individual accounts into a company-wide subscription. They implemented single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access and compliance while maintaining stringent data protection and governance protocols. With HIPAA compliance and enterprise-grade security features, MemorialCare has complete confidence in the tool’s ability to protect sensitive data. “From a governance perspective, Grammarly’s HIPAA-compliant and enterprise-grade security features give us peace of mind,” says Phinsee. “Managing licenses and ensuring compliance couldn’t be any easier.”
Moreover, the AI-powered writing assistant provides real-time suggestions to improve clarity, tone, and style, empowering employees to communicate more effectively across teams. Grammarly’s real-time writing support has proved invaluable for non-native English speakers, allowing them to write more confidently. The tool’s user-friendly interface ensures that all employees, regardless of their language proficiency, maintain a professional standard across written communications.
Results
The impact of Grammarly was immediately evident in both productivity and communication effectiveness. Employees at MemorialCare save an average of over 20 days per year by spending less time on revisions. Phinsee estimates that this equates to over $10,000 saved annually per employee based on their average salary. They also sent out a survey and found that:
90% of users say Grammarly saves them time while writing
90% report that their communication has become more clear since using Grammarly
89% feel more confident using Grammarly in their written communication
81% agree that Grammarly makes their job easier
Grammarly’s ability to enhance communication while maintaining compliance and data security was critical for Phinsee and the rest of the IT department. With features like SSO and detailed usage tracking, Phinsee ensures the organization adheres to proper governance protocols while also managing software licenses effectively. Grammarly’s HIPAA-compliant, enterprise-grade infrastructure and responsible AI features support the department’s IT compliance and security commitment.
As a result of Grammarly’s success, employee adoption has grown steadily, and new departments, including HR, marketing, and employee health, have requested additional licenses. This highlights the tool’s widespread value across the organization.
“The time savings are significant. Grammarly allows everyone to focus on what they’re good at by reducing the time spent drafting messages and figuring out what to say. It’s a powerful tool that boosts productivity across teams… and it’s saved me from some embarrassing mistakes, too.” – Terolyn Phinsee, Senior Software Compliance Manager at MemorialCare
