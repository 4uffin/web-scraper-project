Iterable is an AI-powered customer communication platform that helps brands deliver individualized cross-channel communications at scale.
Trouble Maintaining Brand Voice Across Remote Teams
Lauren Kopulsky, Iterable’s Director of Communications, and her team are responsible for managing nearly all of the company’s messaging. Kopulsky often switches between internal and external communications daily and even ghostwrites for executives. She faces the constant challenge of maintaining Iterable’s voice for different stakeholders, striking the right tone across various channels, and ensuring message consistency.
However, the communication challenges at Iterable go beyond Kopulsky’s team. With a thoughtfully hybrid workplace (nearly 70% of Iterable’s employees are remote), the company is always trying to improve how it communicates internally and cross-functionally across different teams, platforms, and time zones. The marketing and support teams in particular find it challenging to translate complex technical material from the product and engineering teams into clear, customer-friendly language at the speed and scale required.
AI that Fits Seamlessly into Workflows
Kopulsky, and many other teams at Iterable, have turned to Grammarly to solve for Iterable’s various communication challenges. With Grammarly seamlessly integrated into their workflows, teams can refine customer-facing materials, enhance cross-functional collaboration, and maintain a high standard of communication at scale.
Kopulsky especially appreciated this seamless integration. In her role, timing and speed in decision-making and response are critical. Unlike other AI tools that she found disruptive and cumbersome because you had to switch between tabs to use them, Grammarly integrated directly into her existing workflows. This easy integration and the widespread availability of Grammarly’s AI made it an effortless addition to her tech stack.
The benefits of using Grammarly while writing were immediate. “It’s nice to have prompts already in Grammarly for tone so I don’t have that mental overload when I’m working with it,” Kopulsky said. “It’s a de-stressor because it’s simple and straightforward, and I know it’s going to work.”
With Grammarly, the Iterable marketing team can easily adjust the tone to align with Iterable’s audience and brand voice, significantly reducing time spent editing. The tool’s tone detector and AI-powered suggestions also help translate complex technical language into customer-friendly content, alleviating pressure on technical teams.
“I’ve found Grammarly immensely helpful when I’m discussing something technical with internal audiences or customers,” said Jeanette Woodburn, Senior Marketing Operations Manager at Iterable. “Having to go back and forth less on technical requests saves a lot of time, and I also appreciate being able to more clearly explain my work to various stakeholders.
International team members also use Grammarly to bridge communication gaps caused by cultural and geographical differences. “I mostly use it for two things: first, to refine my word-vomit Slack messages to give them more clarity, and second, to spot the differences between British and American English,” said Katie Gray, a Senior Integrated Marketing Manager based in the U.K. “As a Brit, who writes copy for both UK and American audiences, I rely on Grammarly to catch sneaky differences swapping an ‘s’ for a ‘z’ or making sure I write ‘learned’ instead of ‘learnt.’”
“Working Faster and Better” With Grammarly
Grammarly is helping Iterable employees improve the vast majority (93%) of their communications, giving users like Kopulsky nearly two hours back every week. This time savings enables employees to focus on higher-value work while maintaining accuracy and professionalism.
The results prove the ROI of Grammarly to decision-makers at Iterable. “To an executive audience, having me be 1.5x of myself every day is very valuable,” said Kopulsky. “Grammarly is like having another person on my team making sure I’m working faster and better.”
Grammarly’s AI features have also improved results in media outreach campaigns. Kopulsky uses them to craft nuanced subject lines for pitches to analysts and journalists, significantly boosting her response rate. When sending 20 pitches with the same subject line, she might receive one or two responses. By tailoring subject lines with Grammarly, she now averages five to seven responses, increasing engagement by 250%.
“To an executive audience, having me be 1.5 of myself every day is very valuable. Grammarly is like having another person on my team making sure I’m working faster and better.”
Lauren Kopulsky Director of Communications, Iterable
Across Iterable, Grammarly has reduced the time employees spend on internal communications by up to 40%. In addition to enhancing speed, Grammarly ensures consistent messaging and tone in every message. “Every single one of the faster messages I send is exactly the level of professionalism it needs to be for the audience,” Kopulsky said.
Neil Smith, Iterable’s VP of Technical Support, also sees the value of Grammarly in enhancing external communication. Smith’s technical support team has thousands of interactions with customers each year. “Customer satisfaction is a huge priority for us and Grammarly is helping us get there. It has been really helpful in building the skillset of our team members when it comes to the quality of their written communication,” Smith said.
Grammarly has also become a critical part of Iterable’s broader AI adoption strategy. The tool’s ease of onboarding and compliance with legal requirements made it a quick win for the company. “At Iterable, AI is at the core of what we do—we’re focused on helping our customers leverage our AI innovations to elevate their marketing and customer relationships. Grammarly has helped us bring that vision to life internally, making AI-powered communication a seamless part of how we work,” said Kopulsky.
