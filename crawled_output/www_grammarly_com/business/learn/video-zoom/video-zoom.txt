Zoom is a cloud-based platform enabling video and audio conferencing and remote collaboration on a variety of devices.
Scaling up communication to reach a rapidly growing audience
As businesses around the world have shifted to distributed, remote, and hybrid working models, Zoom’s global audience and customer base have grown dramatically.
Zoom’s marketing team quickly hired additional global staff to meet the growing demand, but maintaining consistency in communications became a pressing challenge. New team members needed to learn the company’s brand guidelines, including Zoom’s brand voice, tone, and messaging. They also needed to ensure that every piece of content used approved product terminology. Zoom’s content team found themselves doing more manual writing checks to ensure consistent messaging and terminology, which created unproductive content review bottlenecks.
Real-time feedback to improve, accelerate, and educate
“I was originally looking at Grammarly just for our social and content teams, but then I realized that it helps our broader business communicate better, and align on messaging, product terminology, and tone of voice.”
Rhonda Hughes Global Head of Content, Social Media, and Customer Advocacy at Zoom
Zoom turned to Grammarly’s enterprise team features to streamline reviews and provide real-time coaching to all marketers. They created a custom style guide with more than 175 rules from their brand guidelines. As team members typed, they received instant in-line feedback with on-brand suggestions for improving correctness, clarity, style, tone, and terminology. This real-time review accelerated workflows and allowed new hires to familiarize themselves with brand guidelines as they worked.
“Grammarly has a lot more than just spelling and grammar,” says Rhonda Hughes, Global Head of Content, Social Media, and Customer Advocacy. “I was originally looking at Grammarly just for our social and content teams, but then I realized that it helps our broader business communicate better, and align on messaging, product terminology, and tone of voice.”
The team made the decision to deploy Grammarly beyond marketing so that other departments could also benefit from context-aware suggestions. This not only made communication across the company more efficient, but it has also helped to ensure brand alignment.
According to Zoom’s Senior Social Media Content Specialist, Alison Coleman, Grammarly also helps marketers create more compelling content. Coleman says the second set of “eyes” that review each post gives her greater confidence as she writes. “Grammarly has helped me capture attention in that split-second when someone’s scrolling through their feed. I think it allows me to be really creative.”
7,000+ hours saved: High-quality communication at scale
In the first nine months after Zoom adopted Grammarly, team members received more than 10,000 real-time style guide suggestions. This resulted in an improvement in over 70% of written communications. By accelerating the review process with Grammarly, Zoom saved an estimated 7,000 hours on written communication, representing a value of $210,000.*
“We no longer have to sacrifice quality for speed. It feels like I can do things 100 times faster,” says Matt Torman, Marketing Content Manager at Zoom.
