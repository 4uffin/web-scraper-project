Databricks is a data intelligence platform that helps more than 10,000 organizations apply AI technology to get more from their data.
Maintaining the highest standards at scale
As Databricks grew to 6,000+ employees, its lean editorial team faced a mounting challenge: manually reviewing every corporate and customer-facing communication. With the marketing team alone submitting over 2,100 documents annually, editorial capacity was stretched thin.
A turning point came when a marketing operations manager intercepted an error in a customer-facing email, reinforcing the need for an additional layer of quality control. “For Databricks, trust and professionalism mean everything, and errors in external communications could put our brand reputation at risk,” said Neil Hamilton, Head of Editorial. Lack of clarity was also a concern: “If you can’t articulate your thoughts and communicate concisely, people may get the memo, but they don’t understand it.”
To maintain high standards across marketing, CX, and support teams, Databricks sought a cloud-based solution that was easy to implement, integrated with existing tools, and met enterprise-grade security requirements. Grammarly checked every box.
Raising standards and increasing capacity with Grammarly
With Grammarly, Databricks built a custom style guide that delivers real-time, on-brand suggestions. “Here at Databricks, we’ve got our own way of doing things,” Hamilton said. “Grammarly recognizes custom spellings of words like ‘lakehouse’ and corrects them automatically.”
With Grammarly, maintaining editorial consistency no longer relies on manual oversight. “It’s sort of invisible, and that’s a good thing,” Hamilton said. “Writers don’t have to go out of their way to consult a style guide or ask an editor. Grammarly is always there to head off errors or off-brand language.”
The marketing team saw immediate value, using Grammarly to ensure consistency and refine Databricks’s brand voice. “We collaborate remotely most of the time, so having Grammarly has been extra helpful,” said Millie Lapidario, Senior Copy Editor. “Our teams are growing, more people are writing, and more people are contributing various opinions about editorial style.”
Greater efficiency, greater impact
Grammarly has cut editing time in half, allowing marketing leadership to focus on strategic priorities rather than line edits. “Now that everyone is starting on the same baseline, the same standard, I can focus more of my time on the quality of the writing, the quality of work, and the content,” said Jenna Kozel King, VP of Corporate Marketing.
Databricks is now producing more content than ever—faster. “I’m skimming instead of grinding through copy like a proofreader,” Hamilton said.
For customer-facing teams, Grammarly has also provided an extra layer of quality control, particularly for technical support engineers. Because Grammarly functions as a browser-based plug-in, adoption was seamless.
This has been especially valuable for non-native English speakers in support roles. Grammarly helps them communicate with nuance, empathy, and professionalism when providing frontline support. “Frankly speaking, I cannot imagine working in a support organization without Grammarly,” said Narsi Subramanian, VP of Customer Support.
“Grammarly is essential to our work because, globally, we all need to operate at the highest quality, with the right brand voice and tone, product names, and terminology.”

A significant, measurable return on investment
By implementing Grammarly across marketing, sales, customer experience, support, finance, IT, engineering, and legal, Databricks has saved $1.4 million annually while ensuring every customer-facing message meets the highest standards. That’s a staggering 1,994% ROI.
Grammarly has also helped reduce editing time by 50%, saving 540 hours per year, increased the average number of support cases resolved by 10%–15%, and decreased time to resolution by 25%. The support team now integrates Grammarly into hiring and onboarding, driving nearly $8,000 in employee productivity gains and saving $50,000 annually in soft skills training.
“Grammarly helps us save time, but it’s more about lightening the mental load,” Lapidario said. “Now, our team can devote more of their brain power to the message, the audience, and the brand.”
