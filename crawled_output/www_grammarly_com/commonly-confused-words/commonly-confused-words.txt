Log inFrequently asked questionsWhat are commonly confused words?Commonly confused words may sound alike (homophones), look-alike (homographs), or have related but distinct meanings. For example, "their," "there," and "they're" are often misused because they sound the same but have different meanings.What are homonyms, homophones, and homographs?Homonyms, homophones, and homographs are all types of words that contribute to the complexity of the English language. Homonyms are words that sound alike and are spelled alike but have different meanings, such as "bat," which can mean a flying mammal or a piece of sporting equipment. Homophones are words that sound the same when pronounced but differ in meaning and spelling, like "night" and "knight." Homographs, on the other hand, are words that are spelled the same way but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as "lead" (to guide) and "lead" (a type of metal).How can Grammarly help with commonly confused words?Unlike most spell-checkers, Grammarly uses AI to detect the context of your writing and pinpoint when you’re using a word incorrectly.
