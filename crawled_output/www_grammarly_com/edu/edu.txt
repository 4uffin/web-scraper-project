Providing guidance at every step of the writing process, Grammarly empowers them to not only brainstorm effectively before writing, but to revise their work efficiently—and learn while doing it. At the heart of Grammarly's next-generation communication assistance lies our unwavering commitment to customer trust, with rigorous standards for enterprise data security, user privacy, and responsible AI development.Grammarly's series of AI features designed for students focuses on amplifying thinking and learning, rather than replacing it. AI guideline reminders, suggested academic prompts, and generative AI citations introduce students to the effective and responsible use of AI. Using Grammarly equips students for a future that will increasingly rely on this technology.Does Grammarly for Education work with LMS software (such as Blackboard, Canvas, and Moodle)?Yes, Grammarly works where you work. Grammarly’s suggestions are available on all major web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari) and on desktop apps with our Grammarly for Windows and Mac product offering. What databases does Grammarly’s plagiarism detector check against?Grammarly's plagiarism detector scans writing against ProQuest's proprietary databases and billions of web pages and articles, then highlights passages that may contain potential plagiarism. Grammarly provides each scanned document with an originality score and links to any matching sources that require citation. Our plagiarism detector does not check text against an internal database or against writing previously submitted by you or others.With Grammarly for Education, will my data be secure?We maintain uncompromising security standards and procedures to keep your words and account data safe. Our many certifications and compliances include education industry standards such as Student Online Personal Protection Act (“SOPPA”), Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Is plagiarism detection the same as AI detection?Plagiarism detection and AI detection are not the same. Plagiarism detection involves comparing a piece of writing to a vast database of previously published works to identify any similarities.
AI detection, as it relates to writing, refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to identify text that was created using AI. However, the increasingly human-like quality of AI writing has made it challenging to detect AI-created content accurately. While AI detection tools may exist, this technology is not reliable.
Grammarly’s AI guideline reminders specifically encourage students to honor their institutions’ policies. Additionally, Grammarly's citation feature promotes transparency by allowing students to cite the use of AI in their work in just a few clicks if that's what's asked of them.Confident communication anywhere writing and learning happenStay focused and save time by using Grammarly to access AI writing assistance wherever you write without switching apps or toggling between tabs in your web browser.AppleWindowsGoogle DocsGmailMicrosoft WordZoomCanvasMicrosoft OutlookBlackboardMoodleJoin 3,000 institutions that trust GrammarlySupport students with the AI writing partner that helps them achieve better results, boost confidence, and prepare for career success.Contact Education SalesSign Up With Your SchoolBy signing up, you agree to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.California residents, see our CA Notice at Collection.Get GrammarlyDocsGrammarly for Your DesktopGrammarly for WindowsGrammarly for MacGrammarly Browser ExtensionGrammarly for ChromeGrammarly for SafariGrammarly for FirefoxGrammarly for EdgeGrammarly for MS OfficeGrammarly for Google DocsGrammarly for MobileGrammarly for iPhoneGrammarly for iPadGrammarly for AndroidLearn MorePlansGrammarly ProGrammarly for Teams & BusinessesGrammarly EnterpriseGrammarly for EducationAI at GrammarlyGenerative AIAI Writing AssistantBlogTech BlogEducation BlogBusiness BlogCommonly Confused WordsCodaSuperhumanFeaturesGrammar CheckerPlagiarism CheckerAI AgentsAI DetectorAI HumanizerCitation GeneratorEssay CheckerParaphrasing ToolAI Writing ToolsTone DetectorWord CounterCharacter CounterParagraph CounterSentence CounterStyle GuideSnippetsAnalyticsBrand TonesAuthorshipCitation FinderAI GraderReader ReactionsExpert ReviewSpell CheckerSentence CheckerPunctuation CheckerPassive Voice CheckerProofreaderCompanyAboutWe Stand With UkraineResponsible AICareers & CulturePressAffiliatesPartnersTrust CenterPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceCustomer Business AgreementCA Notice at CollectionSecurityAccessibilityYour Privacy ChoicesConnectHelp CenterContact Us Facebook Instagram X LinkedIn© 2025 Grammarly, Inc.
