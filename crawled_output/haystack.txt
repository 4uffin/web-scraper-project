Haystack is an end-to-end LLM framework that allows you to build applications powered by
LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more. Whether you want to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
document search, question answering or answer generation, Haystack can orchestrate state-of-the-art embedding models
and LLMs into pipelines to build end-to-end NLP applications and solve your use case.

Installation
The simplest way to get Haystack is via pip:
pip install haystack-ai
Install from the main branch to try the newest features:
pip install git+https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git@main
Haystack supports multiple installation methods including Docker images. For a comprehensive guide please refer
to the documentation.
Documentation
If you're new to the project, check out "What is Haystack?" then go
through the "Get Started Guide" and build your first LLM application
in a matter of minutes. Keep learning with the tutorials. For more advanced
use cases, or just to get some inspiration, you can browse our Haystack recipes in the
Cookbook.
At any given point, hit the documentation to learn more about Haystack, what can it do for you and the technology behind.
Features
Technology agnostic: Allow users the flexibility to decide what vendor or technology they want and make it easy to switch out any component for another. Haystack allows you to use and compare models available from OpenAI, Cohere and Hugging Face, as well as your own local models or models hosted on Azure, Bedrock and SageMaker.
Explicit: Make it transparent how different moving parts can “talk” to each other so it's easier to fit your tech stack and use case.
Flexible: Haystack provides all tooling in one place: database access, file conversion, cleaning, splitting, training, eval, inference, and more. And whenever custom behavior is desirable, it's easy to create custom components.
Extensible: Provide a uniform and easy way for the community and third parties to build their own components and foster an open ecosystem around Haystack.
Some examples of what you can do with Haystack:
Build retrieval augmented generation (RAG) by making use of one of the available vector databases and customizing your LLM interaction, the sky is the limit 🚀
Perform Question Answering in natural language to find granular answers in your documents.
Perform semantic search and retrieve documents according to meaning.
Build applications that can make complex decisions making to answer complex queries: such as systems that can resolve complex customer queries, do knowledge search on many disconnected resources and so on.
Scale to millions of docs using retrievers and production-scale components.
Use off-the-shelf models or fine-tune them to your data.
Use user feedback to evaluate, benchmark, and continuously improve your models.
Tip
Would you like to deploy and serve Haystack pipelines as REST APIs yourself? Hayhooks provides a simple way to wrap your pipelines with custom logic and expose them via HTTP endpoints, including OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoints and compatibility with fully-featured chat interfaces like open-webui.
Haystack Enterprise: Best Practices and Expert Support
Get expert support from the Haystack team, build faster with enterprise-grade templates, and scale securely with deployment guides for cloud and on-prem environments - all with Haystack Enterprise. Read more about it our announcement post.

Tip
Are you looking for a managed solution that benefits from Haystack? deepset AI Platform is our fully managed, end-to-end platform to integrate LLMs with your data, which uses Haystack for the LLM pipelines architecture.
Telemetry
Haystack collects anonymous usage statistics of pipeline components. We receive an event every time these components are initialized. This way, we know which components are most relevant to our community.
Read more about telemetry in Haystack or how you can opt out in Haystack docs.
