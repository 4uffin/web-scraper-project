As you reach the town of Bellhart in Hollow Knight: Silksong, you'll start the quest "The Threadspun Town" as you see all of the villagers are paralyzed in silk. For this wish, you'll need to save the town and break the silken curse that has trapped the town. However, you can't just slash the threads because that would just be too easy. Progressing further into the quest can be a bit difficult as there isn't a clear lead to chase after, but for now, we know that we have to make it past that golden door. Here's how to complete the "The Threadspun Town" quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong along with all of the abilities that you'll need. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

"The Threadspun Town" quest can be started in Haunted Bellhart, which is located to the left of Greymoor and to the right of Shellwood.

Prior to continuing the "The Threadspun Town" wish, you'll need to grab the Cling Grip ability, which can be found at the top of Shellwood. Its exact location can be found in the image above.
Starting from the bench on the right side of Shellwood, enter the elevator and head into the area on the right. Continue to the right and jump up the platforms until you need to use your Cling Grip ability to reach the higher ground. After you make it onto the ledge, continue ahead and break the bell walls blocking your path. In this area, you'll encounter furms and winged furms, which are furballs wearing a bell as a hat. The regular furms will jump out of the ground while the winged furms will fly up and down the vertical corridors. You can run from the furms, but we recommend dealing with the winged furms as they will block the entire corridor. Continue to the right, but don't immediately drop down the hole. There is a winged furm patrolling this corridor along with spikes at the bottom of the pit. Either wait for the winged furm to fly upwards or defeat it, and slowly make your way down the hole and onto the ledge on the right. Break the bell wall and drop into the pit ahead.

Once you're at the bottom, head to the left to find another vertical pathway blocked by a winged furm. As the winged furm starts to descend, slowly glide down behind it and enter the opening on the left. Before you drop down again, you should know that there is another winged furm blocking this path. We recommend eliminating the first winged furm, so you don't have to worry about them closing in from above.

After you've dealt with the first, slowly follow the second winged furm and head into the opening on your left. Break the bell wall on your left, and before you drop down, make sure to watch out for the falling bells. Continue ahead to find a hole that leads towards the boss area, but we recommend continuing left as it will lead you back to the bench in Shellwood (and you won't have to deal with the winged furms anymore). After you open the passageway, return to the boss area to face off against Widow, a spider who has cursed all of the townspeople of Bellhart.

The main thing you'll need to look out for while fighting Widow is all of the bells at her disposal. They'll drop bells from the ceiling and occasionally sling bells in your direction. To make things worse, the bells will bounce on the floor before they disappear, so we recommend hitting the bells away from you. Another attack to look out for is when they scurry across the ground. Their movement isn't exactly the thing you need to be wary about, but rather the falling obstacles from the ceiling. They won't all fall at once, but in the direction that Widow ran across the screen. For example, if Widow ran right to left, the obstacles would fall from right to left. To avoid the obstacles, jump into the air in an empty spot and glide over the obstacles until they disappear. After you defeat Widow, you'll free the town of their silk curse and complete the "The Threadspun Town" wish.

As a reward, you'll learn how to play the Needolin, which is an instrument made up of your needle and some silk. Additionally, Bellhart will be free of its curse and you can access all of their stores, where you can upgrade your needle. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier.

If you save and quit in Haunted Bellhart and you come back into the game, you are strung up like the villagers. Gave me quite a scare today
