Mando and Baby Yoda will return in a big-screen adventure in 2026. Lucasfilm dropped the first trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu on Monday, revealing more about its story and giving us a look at new and returning characters from the Star Wars galaxy. Plus, it's got multiple Anzellans — you know, Babu Friks — and a slick new ride for The Mandalorian. The first trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu promises lots of action: We see our heroes blowing up AT-ATs, engaging in underground gladiatorial combat, and rubbing elbows with Sigourney Weaver's character, a mysterious member of the New Republic. In addition to the trailer, we got a brief plot synopsis from Lucasfilm.
The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu (as himself).
The Mandalorian’s Zeb Orrelios is also here, plus a few familiar Star Wars alien faces (that is, if you're intimately familiar with Star Wars aliens by obsessing over action figures made of them). Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu is directed by Jon Favreau, who co-wrote the movie with Dave Filoni. As you've probably already heard, Ludwig Göransson returns to score the film based on the Disney Plus TV series. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026.

I'm almost impressed how little emotion I felt watching this trailer. Everything is so familiar to the point of numbness; the logo looks like it was made in Microsoft Word by a committee of twenty people, the set pieces are completely disinteresting, and even the new ship is literally just Mando's old one with a fresh coat of paint for the toy manufacturers to slap on. A lot of people hate on the sequel trilogy, but at least hate is an emotion. This looks like the film equivalent of microwaved dinosaur nuggets -- I'm sure some people will love it, but god, I'm starving for something more substantial.

I love Star Wars. really – most of it.But this now looks like a kid playing with their favourite SW toys. Let's pick out this cool action figure, yes AT-AT, yes U-Wing. Felt kinda boring.

Wow, I didn't expect much from this but I'm really surprised how unapologetically schlocky it looks.

After the lackluster season 3 I have little expectations.I'm wondering how much this will devolve in Filoniverse fanservice.

"This is the way" is such a placeholder catchphrase. It's like "Just Do It" but in the passive voice
