Eridium is a rare material in the world of Borderlands 4 that you use as currency to pay for specific services. Since you won’t find lots of Eridium just waiting for you or an infinite farm location, you need to be mindful of how you use it. There are, however, some activities that always reward you with a small amount of it, making it possible to consistently earn more Eridium. Below, we explain how to use Eridium in Borderlands 4 as well as how to get more.
How to use Eridium in Borderlands 4
There are three ways to use Eridium in Borderlands 4:
Weekly Moxxi’s Big Encore
Respeccing Specialization points
Firmware transfer

In Borderlands 4, you can redo a boss fight by paying a certain amount of money at Moxxi’s Big Encore machine, which is always outside of the boss' arena. Once a week, as part of the weekly challenges, you can face a stronger version of a selected boss, but, instead of paying cash, you need to pay 100 Eridium to redo the fight. Going after the buffed version of a boss is a good strategy when looking for legendary gear and guns. To know which boss is the weekly Moxxi’s Big Encore, you can check the map menu in the bottom left corner or look for a red boss icon on the map.
Respeccing Specialization points

Specialization is a system that only becomes available to you after completing the campaign once. It gives you access to different skill trees and passive abilities that are extremely useful when preparing your character’s build for the endgame. You can refund your Specialization points by paying 5,000 Eridium at a respec machine. Don’t forget that you need to pay this amount every time you use the machine. Respeccing your Specialization points is very expensive, so think carefully before you spend your Eridium.
Firmware transfer

Firmwares are special bonuses that can spawn on repkits, ordnance, class mods, shields, and enhancements. However, as your gear has a chance to come with a random firmware, you can utilize the transfer machine to swap the firmware on your gear to another firmware that you own on a different piece of gear. We tested transferring firmware from one ordnance to another and from one class mod to another. In both cases, although the cost in cash changes depending on the items you’re transferring firmwares from, the process always charges 80 Eridium.

If you want to get more Eridium, the simplest method is to play the game. You can earn Eridium from several sources, from missions to killing regular enemies. While the latter is completely random, the former is the best option when trying to regularly farm Eridium. In Borderlands 4, there are many types of missions. You receive Eridium from campaign quests, side missions, challenges, and contracts (bounties and patrols). Among these, the contracts are the fastest method to get more Eridium since finding a bounty target is simple, and you can repeat them.

If you have the time and like to explore, you should focus on unlocking the Safehouses and Silos (with our interactive map open on the side). Claiming the command console will give you 25 Eridium, but you can only receive this reward once per location. Another way to gain more Eridium is by facing World Bosses. As an example, at level 38, we killed Saddleback and the Immortal Boneface and received 25 Eridium. Do you need more help with Borderlands 4? For those who are new to Kairos, check out our beginner’s guide before you get started and our best classes guide to find the right one for your playstyle. If you want to have fun with your weapons, be sure to read our guide on how to get more SDU tokens. We know that traversing the immense map of Kairos is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a vehicle, as well as fast travel points. And if you're already enjoying the endgame of Borderlands 4, don’t forget to check the weekly reset time for all current challenges.
