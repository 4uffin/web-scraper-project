R.A. Salvatore has been writing about the drow ranger Drizzt Do'Urden since 1987, but for The Finest Edge of Twilight, his next book set in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Salvatore shifted his focus to Drizzt’s daughter Briennelle Zaharina Do’Urden aka Breezy. Salvatore previously took breaks from his most famous character when he wrote The Cleric Quintet and The Sellswords Trilogy, but this time is different. “I’m not saying I’m going back to Drizzt. I don’t know that I ever will. I don’t know that I ever need to,” Salvatore told Polygon in a Zoom interview. “I expect I’ll finish the books I have under contract, and then when the urge hits me again, I’ll figure out what I want to write and why I want to write it and I’ll write it.” Salvatore is currently working on the last book of the DemonWars Saga and has one other book he’s contracted to write that he can’t talk about yet, but after that the 66-year-old author says he wants to largely retire and focus on spending time with his family.

“I have eight grandkids,” he said. “They all live around here. That means little league games, hockey games and drum lessons. I love watching them grow up.” One of the things he’s been sharing with his family is his love of fantasy and D&D. Salvatore’s first exposure to the genre came when his sister gave him J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit in 1997 and now his 8-year-old grandson is reading the book. Both of his sons play D&D and run games for the family. He recently helped his five-year-old grandson play his first game of the tabletop role-playing game alongside two 9-year-olds and a 6-year-old. “It got really fun when one of [my grandkids] said ‘I’m hitting him’ and he pointed to his cousin. They wanted to fight,” Salvatore said. “There’s too much story, there’s not enough action, not enough loot. It was really fun.” Salvatore hasn’t heard any negative feedback on his decision to focus his next book on Breezy, but he admits that he doesn’t hear from readers as much as he used to because he got tired of reading so many complaints on Facebook. “Social media almost makes me ill at this point, and since that’s where everybody is, I am not as tuned in as I was a few years ago and I think I’m healthier because I’m not,” he said. “I don’t want to play this game anymore. It’s a destructive game in a life that’s too short to begin with. The Finest Edge of Twilight will be released on Oct. 7.

Met him back in the 90's when I was dm games for the rpga tsr/woc at Gen con and a few other game cons, very nice man who took the time for his fans.He has nothing to prove to anybody,
his volume of work speaks for itself.

Much respect to one of the greats. I met Salvatore at a PAX East several years back. He was super-chill, friendly, and stuck around long after a panel he was on to just chat with folks. He signed my copy of KOA: Reckoning and we (oddly) talked about the Buffalo Bills and their season (and this was back when Bills fans didn't have much to be excited about). He struck me as just a normal dude (complimentary). I can only be happy for him as he shifts to spending more time with his family. The Drizzt books were a huge part of my adolescence and really served as my entry point to D&D. Also, don't sleep on the Demonwars Saga. Such a different vibe from Drizzt books, and they prove Salvatore can world-build with the best of them.

The man and drow have more than earned their retirements. Let them enjoy watching the next generation come into their own.

I can't imagine how hard it would be to continue to create new stories for 38 years. Drizzt was an amazing character and I've loved reading about his adventures since I was teenager. Much respect for being able to go for so long... But he right, it's time to put the pen down and enjoy time with family.
