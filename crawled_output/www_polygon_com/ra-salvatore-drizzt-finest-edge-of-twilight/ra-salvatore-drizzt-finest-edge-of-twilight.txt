R.A. Salvatore has been writing about the drow ranger Drizzt Do'Urden since 1987, but for The Finest Edge of Twilight, his next book set in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms campaign setting, Salvatore shifted his focus to Drizzt’s daughter Briennelle Zaharina Do’Urden aka Breezy. Salvatore previously took breaks from his most famous character when he wrote The Cleric Quintet and The Sellswords Trilogy, but this time is different. “I’m not saying I’m going back to Drizzt. I don’t know that I ever will. I don’t know that I ever need to,” Salvatore told Polygon in a Zoom interview. “I expect I’ll finish the books I have under contract, and then when the urge hits me again, I’ll figure out what I want to write and why I want to write it and I’ll write it.” Salvatore is currently working on the last book of the DemonWars Saga and has one other book he’s contracted to write that he can’t talk about yet, but after that the 66-year-old author says he wants to largely retire and focus on spending time with his family.

“I have eight grandkids,” he said. “They all live around here. That means little league games, hockey games and drum lessons. I love watching them grow up.” One of the things he’s been sharing with his family is his love of fantasy and D&D. Salvatore’s first exposure to the genre came when his sister gave him J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit in 1977 and now his 8-year-old grandson is reading the book. Both of his sons play D&D and run games for the family. He recently helped his five-year-old grandson play his first game of the tabletop role-playing game alongside two 9-year-olds and a 6-year-old. “It got really fun when one of [my grandkids] said ‘I’m hitting him’ and he pointed to his cousin. They wanted to fight,” Salvatore said. “There’s too much story, there’s not enough action, not enough loot. It was really fun.” Salvatore hasn’t heard any negative feedback on his decision to focus his next book on Breezy, but he admits that he doesn’t hear from readers as much as he used to because he got tired of reading so many complaints on Facebook. “Social media almost makes me ill at this point, and since that’s where everybody is, I am not as tuned in as I was a few years ago and I think I’m healthier because I’m not,” he said. “I don’t want to play this game anymore. It’s a destructive game in a life that’s too short to begin with. The Finest Edge of Twilight will be released on Oct. 7.

I can't imagine how hard it would be to continue to create new stories for 38 years. Drizzt was an amazing character and I've loved reading about his adventures since I was teenager. Much respect for being able to go for so long... But he right, it's time to put the pen down and enjoy time with family.

Met him back in the 90's when I was dm games for the rpga tsr/woc at Gen con and a few other game cons, very nice man who took the time for his fans.He has nothing to prove to anybody,
his volume of work speaks for itself.

Much respect to one of the greats. I met Salvatore at a PAX East several years back. He was super-chill, friendly, and stuck around long after a panel he was on to just chat with folks. He signed my copy of KOA: Reckoning and we (oddly) talked about the Buffalo Bills and their season (and this was back when Bills fans didn't have much to be excited about). He struck me as just a normal dude (complimentary). I can only be happy for him as he shifts to spending more time with his family. The Drizzt books were a huge part of my adolescence and really served as my entry point to D&D. Also, don't sleep on the Demonwars Saga. Such a different vibe from Drizzt books, and they prove Salvatore can world-build with the best of them.

The man and drow have more than earned their retirements. Let them enjoy watching the next generation come into their own.

As good as Drizzt is, Salvatore should move on.
I'm sure he has more stories to tell that don't involve Drizzt and I for one would welcome them.
If he wants to play D&D with his grandkids then you never know that might spark an entirely different story

At least he wrote and finished his stories. I get what he's saying. George Lucas and George RR Martin have heard so much from toxic fans it's a wonder they ever published anything else. GRRM should finish the last 2 books though. Without the fans he wouldn't be where he is today. Just finish what you started and move on to something else or like Mr. Salvatore; retire! I'd love to play DnD with him and grandkids. Awesome

The end of an era. Drizzt is like one of my old friends. Sad to see it end, but you've done great. Farewell Do'Urden. Enjoy your well deserved retirement Salvatore.

Shouldn't really be a shock but still not what I expected to see. End of an era. I'll admit I'm still several years behind but Drizzt has been a staple of my life since I was in like the second grade and picked up a copy of the Legend of Drizzt trilogy from half price books

I have to say I love all of are a Salvatore's legend of Drizzit's books. But I think that spending time with your family is very important so as long as it's a happy ending finally maybe a little rest because with him it's one adventure after another which I love I would like to see where Jersey goes with this I am currently not done with this yet I think I am on timeless. So I believe I have a little ways to go but I'm going to miss my man. He is the baddest dude ever now are we going to talk about making animated movies or even live action movies with him in this whole series? Let's make it happen I know it'll be great I'm from one won't be able to turn it off

Salvatore gave me so many of my favorite books of all time, drawing me into a world I couldn't care about before and giving me a ton of stories and characters that have stuck with me all these years and are just as strong in my mind at 37 as they were at 13. He's earned the right to do whatever he wants, and I'm glad to know he's happy, satisfied, and enjoying his family.

Tbh, if love more drizzt books, but I was sure his saga was ending before he had the companions of the hall reincarnate. Was expecting a few more books, and then on to other things.Having a couple of series after that point, I'm super happy to have more of my favorite characters. However he can only rehash adventures for so long... Time does move forward on the forgotten realms. If nothing ever truly changes, it would begin to lose its spark.
