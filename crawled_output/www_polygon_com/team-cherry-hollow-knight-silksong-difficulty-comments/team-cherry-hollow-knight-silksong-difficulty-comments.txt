Just about all Silksong players can agree on one thing, whether or not they played the original Hollow Knight: The game is pretty freakin' hard. Developer Team Cherry recently addressed the game's difficulty at the opening of a gaming exhibition at Australia's Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) museum, sharing insight into just why the new game is proving so challenging. "Hornet is inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight — so even the base level enemy had to be more complicated, more intelligent," Silksong co-director Ari Gibson said (via Dexerto). Co-director William Pellen added, "In contrast to the Knight’s enemies, Hornet’s enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away," explaining how Team Cherry added new ways for Hornet's enemies "to evade and check you." Team Cherry intended to "bring everyone else up to match [Hornet's] level," and maybe did so a bit too much, as the game's first patch made some bosses slightly easier to tackle. That patch came after modders attempted to make the game slightly easier on Windows PC. Being a Metroidvania, exploration is a key component of Hollow Knight: Silksong, and letting players get lost is one way Team Cherry allows them to somewhat circumvent the game's difficulty. "Silksong has some moments of steep difficulty — but part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you’re going and what you’re doing," Gibson said. He said it's "fine" if players are stuck on a challenging boss or encounter as "they have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled." In addition to the Game Worlds exhibition, ACMI has also put together a softcover, 64-page zine on Hollow Knight Silksong. It includes "exclusive concept art, character sketches, maps and a new interview with Team Cherry" as it "celebrates the artistry, world-building and lasting impact of Hollow Knight and its sequel, Silksong." It ships internationally, though it'll cost a pretty penny. If you're trudging through Silksong, check out Polygon's tips for beginners and compendium of Silksong guides, or scan our full Silksong interactive map. Or maybe playing through Silksong's permadeath mode is more your speed. Either way, the game ain't getting any easier.

Despite it's massive audience it feels like silksong fans are divided into 3rds. 1 third thinks the game is too hard, another third spends time trolling comments sections to attack the people who think it's too hard or not the greatest game ever made, and then finally the last third actually enjoy playing the game

I''m not sure how you can really mitigate difficulty through exploration. You get a few movement abilities, but otherwise your strength is pretty much locked in place for the vast majority of the game. You have to find 8 masks for enough health to really feel a difference, all of the charms tend to be lateral moves since you are limited on slots, and your damage gets one upgrade for a giant chunk of the game.All exploring really gets you is more boss fights to clear.

To continue and compare to Elden Ring, another game with a lot of talk of difficulty given the number of newer players to the formula, if you found a wall you could always go elsewhere and either level up, get more weapon upgrades, get new spells/techniques, or find new spirit ashes, many of which were often strictly more powerful. The game seemed to almost beeline you into the first boss, simply to teach you that you could do this.

None of the bosses are as hard as the original game. I'm hoping for a terrifying boss to come out in the DLC. Also as you just said you can get masks to give you more health, some charms are actually useful on a lot of bosses so yes exploration does help. You just need to git gud

My god, the "it's not that hard" fanboys for this game are insufferable. I have over 80hrs in HK and this game is way more difficult and cruel. Honestly, it's changed my entire option of Team Cherry for the worse.

Correction: they have ways to mitigate the difficulty via checking out websites or videos to figure out what to explore and how, because otherwise, they'll be lost and confused when exploring all by themselves.It's funny that people either can't or won't acknowledge this flaw of "this game." It's fun gameplay, yes, but horrible experience of exploration. You're just playing, but you're hardly exploring. It's like you're taking an exam, but with cheat sheet.

That's the point of Metroidvanias I love, exploring and the map slowly being drawn after each bench. Also I feel I have a better sense of direction than with the original hollow Knight. There is ofc hidden areas but most of the time you won't do those till the end of the game anyways. It's not a flaw it's one of the most popular features.

Silksong isn't half as hard as hollow Knight. It's still a great game, but if you find the right tool combination then most bosses barely have to be hit by the needle to win. I'm not sure what the boss would be like if you have every tool and mask and silk spool but the only one I found to be truly hard was the last judge.
