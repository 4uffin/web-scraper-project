Fall is officially here, which means it's time to schedule your annual rewatch of Over the Garden Wall, Cartoon Network's 2014 animated miniseries that follows two boys lost in the woods and the sometimes charming, sometimes frightening cast of characters they encounter. To celebrate the series, pop culture collectibles site Mondo is putting up for preorder a series of Over the Garden Wall figures. The first wave will showcase protagonists Wirt and Greg for $95. They're highly customizable with swappable arms and heads, and Wirt's cloak can be worn in three different styles. Greg can be accessorized with his "candy camouflage" and his frog, who goes by too many names to list here. A small Beatrice figure is part of the set as well so the trio can travel together. A Limited Edition set will also include The Dog from the opening episode, though no Woodsman. It'll retail for $135 at Mondo's shop. These figures are described as the first in a series, and future sets will showcase more of the show's cast. Chapter 2 will be all about the Pottsfield Pumpkin People. Here's to hoping we get the Woodsman, the Beast, Auntie Whispers, and more in future series.
A new variant of Mondo's perpetually sold-out Over the Garden Wall soundtrack will also be on the way. The Potatoes & Molasses Colorway will be pressed on burgundy vinyl, and will retail for $35. It'll come with a 20-page booklet with lyrics and sheet music from the soundtrack. If you somehow haven't seen the classic series yet, at least give the first episode a go. It's currently free on YouTube in an era where cartoons disappear from streaming sites one after the other. Longtime fans will also want to check out a stop motion short released last year to celebrate the show's ten-year anniversary. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated which figures were exclusive to the Limited Edition.

Beatrice is included with the basic. It is the dog that is excluded. It is, however subject to the drump tariffs.
