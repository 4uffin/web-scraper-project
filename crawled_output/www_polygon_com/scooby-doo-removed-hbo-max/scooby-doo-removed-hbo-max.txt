In my household, spoopy TV reigns supreme. And that means Scooby-Doo is an icon. Having watched nearly every episode of every series aired since Scooby’s debut in 1969 — and almost every direct-to-video movie of the 2000s that kept the franchise alive in the modern age —I can say with authority that the misadventures of Mystery Inc. hold up. They’re funny, they’re vibrant, and the formula goes down easy. So you can imagine the dismay my family felt when we discovered this week that nearly all Scooby-Doo programming had been removed from HBO Max. Ruh-roh! For years, HBO Max (then Max, then back to HBO Max…) had been the streaming home of Scooby, Shaggy, Velma, Fred, and Daphne. Also Scrappy, if you could tolerate Scooby’s punchy nephew. A creation of Hanna-Barbera that became part of the broader Warner Bros. Animation portfolio in the early 2000s, shows like Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, and more recent iterations like Scooby-Doo and Guess Who? were a bedrock of the platform’s retro all-ages programming alongside Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes. Now they’re gone. I am not a fool: This is what happens to things we love in the streaming TV era. If I were a true diehard, I would buy a used DVD copy of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo so I could spin that killer theme song (performed by Stew of The Negro Problem!) Yes, I could also watch Scoob, WB’s frenetic 2020 attempt to turn the gang into CG superheroes alongside Blue Falcon and Dynomutt in an expanded Hanna-Barbera universe which remains on HBO Max, but I don’t want to do that because it’s not good. Even my children would much rather watch a 46-minute installment of The New Scooby-Doo Movies that hinges on a bewildering-to-them Tim Conway cameo than watch today’s IP lords stretch Scooby into something he’s not. We live for the compact mysteries.
The bright side of having the rug pulled from under our feet is that (1) there are scattered options to watch some of the old Scooby cartoons and (2) there is a grieving community out there waiting to embrace anyone feeling the feels over the loss of a comprehensive Scooby streaming collection. Continuing a deal with Warner Bros and HBO that has seen everything from The Batman to Band of Brothers hit the platform, it appears Netflix recently added 2010’s Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated series, which harkens back to the ’70s era of sleuthing, albeit with some actual monsters instead of masked evildoers who would have gotten away with it if it weren’t for the meddling kids. Meanwhile, much like it did with Looney Tunes, Tubi has picked up three of the classic series’ for free streaming with ads. While HBO Max still hosts the extremely watchable 2022 DTV movie Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo! — it still needs something for Halloween — every other one-off movie has been removed. Luckily, the mourners on the Scooby-Doo subreddit assembled a guide to where you can rent pretty much every series and movie, between Amazon and Fandango. Bless the sickos. But it all means that on top of the $170/year cost for HBO Max, I will have to shell out $3 or whatever the next time my family has a hankering Scooby-Doo Pirates Ahoy! Either that, or I need to devote precious floor space to a shelf full of Scooby physical media. Life is full of hard choices. Polygon has reached out to Warner Bros. Entertainment for comment on the decision to release the Scooby-Doo license into the wild, and will update this story with any response. The quiet decision comes shortly after WB brokered a deal with Netflix to produce the first live-action Scooby show with the team behind Riverdale which doesn’t sound like a thing that will fill the void of Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island-sized void in my heart but what can you do.

It's not fair to expect a polygon blogger to be informed about anything
