About Austin Manchester
Austin Manchester is a writer and editor living in New York City. He’s been writing about the video game industry since 2021 and was previously wrote for AIPT Comics, XDA, and How-To Geek before joining Polygon. He enjoys covering new indie releases, soulslikes, and character-driven RPGs. He spends too much time playing Mass Effect, Baldur’s Gate 3, and new indie releases and not enough time working on that book he might someday finish, maybe, who knows.
