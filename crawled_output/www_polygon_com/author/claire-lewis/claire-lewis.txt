About Claire Lewis
Claire is a walking Baldur’s Gate 3 encyclopedia, RPG nerd, and professional lore huntress.
She’s spent roughly 1,000 hours (each) exploring Baldur’s Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, and will happily talk your ear off about either title. When she’s not writing, she can usually be found researching obscure Japanese horror games from the early 2000s, begging people to play ABZÛ, or whining about The Sims. She’s currently awaiting Pathologic 3, Subnautica 2, and the Alien: Isolation sequel with bated breath. She has still not emotionally recovered from Titanfall’s undeserved fate.
“You play like a girl” is a compliment.

I have a horrible theory about Alien: Earth's alien eyeball
