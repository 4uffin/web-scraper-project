How to find the lost chickens in Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar
'SOS! Runaway Birds!' quest reward
One of the early quests you'll need to complete in Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar involves finding escaped chickens around town for a merchant. As a new farmer who has just moved into Zephyr town, you’ll have plenty of things to do — like talking to your new friends around the town and growing crops to sell in the marketplace, but you will need to do quests, too. The quest, titled "SOS! Runaway Birds!," is given to the farmer by Kat, who can be found either in the hotel on the east side of town or in the market. The hotel is run by an old married couple, Stuart and Sonia, and it’s where they are all the time unless there is an event in town, so if you get lost, check where they are and you’ll find the hotel in no time. Speak to Kat and she will give you the quest. In a stroke of really bad luck, Kat managed to lose her animals. So, it's up to you to find them. That's where we come in: read on below to figure out where those feathered fiends are hiding in Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar.
How to find the lost chickens in Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar
The first chicken can be found almost directly outside the hotel. From the hotel, head south and cross over the first bridge to head back into town.

From that bridge, turn right and keep going until you spot the chicken near the water's edge. You’ll know you're in the right place because you’ll see a wooden house at the water's edge on the opposite side.

One chicken down: two more to go! The second chicken can be found right outside of Mayor Felix's house.

From the hotel, exit and make your way to the main square in town. Head up the stairs and turn left. Keep on going until you see the blue mansion, where a chicken will be waiting for you just outside the front door.

If you're unsure of where to go, check your map. While Mayor Felix and his daughter are usually out and about, they do go home in the evening. So wherever they are, that's where their home is and where you'll find the chicken. The third and last chicken can be found on your way back to the farm.

From the hotel, cross over the bridge and keep on going until you cross over another bridge to head north towards your farm. On the way there, keep to the left and you’ll see a waterfall. You know that age-old saying about how, in video games, there's always treasure to be found behind a waterfall? Well, a chicken is sort of like a treasure, isn't it?

Check out behind the waterfall and the final chicken will be there.
'SOS! Runaway Birds!' quest reward
With all the chickens found, you can now head back to Kat. Kat can be found at the hotel or in the marketplace, but if she's not there for any reason, check back daily until she appears. Once you speak to Kat, she will thank you and open up her own stall on the following Saturday. This stall allows you to rehome your pets or animals. Even so, this stall will help you in ranking up the bazaar, so it's in your best interest to complete this quest as soon as possible.
