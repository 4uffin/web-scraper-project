Larian Studios may be done with major updates for Baldur's Gate 3, but it's still pumping out hotfixes to squash bugs and improve performance. The game's latest update, hotfix #34, includes a special treat for those who prefer to explore Faerûn on the go: a native Baldur's Gate 3 build for Steam Deck, which allows the award-winning RPG to run natively on the platform. A native build also means Steam Deck users should experience a more stable framerate, less time stuck on loading screens, and a smoother overall gameplay experience. Larian says the game's latest build is good for all players, regardless of their platform-of-choice. "This is not just good news for Steam Deck users either," the studio explained in a blog post. "The work the team has put into this build also means that everyone will get to enjoy overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3." Larian says that when players launch the game on Steam Deck after installing hotfix #34, the game will be set to use native Steam Deck graphics settings by default, but players can always tweak these settings, whether they're playing natively or via Proton. The studio has also published a detailed guide (complete with screenshots) for any Steam Deck users who may need a bit more help setting things up.
