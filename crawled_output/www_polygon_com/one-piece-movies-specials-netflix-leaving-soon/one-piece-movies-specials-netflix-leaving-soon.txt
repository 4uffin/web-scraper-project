Six One Piece films are setting sail from Netflix on September 1. The streamer is betting as big as Shanks on the franchise’s future, with a heavy investment in its live-action series and brand-new anime from Wit Studio. Odds are that these movies will dock back on Netflix someday, but for now, here’s the best watch order if you want to enjoy them before they vanish over the horizon. Many One Piece films lie outside the series canon, but some of these movies recount entire sagas from the series. What’s more, some of these could fit into the canon, and some allude to plot points within the ongoing story. That’s why some of these options are more important to watch than others. So here’s the lowest to highest priority order if you’re cramming on One Piece over the next few days.

6. One Piece: Episode of East Blue
This TV special tries to cram the East Blue saga’s 61 episodes into just an hour and 45 minutes. To tell the origin story of Monkey D. Luffy setting sail on his quest to become King of the Pirates, a lot has to be cut, including key moments of character development for Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While some newcomers might find it a quick introduction to One Piece, longtime fans often disagree, and most would say this is one special you can safely skip.

5. One Piece: Episode of Skypiea
Just as disappointing as Episode of East Blue, the Skypiea special completely trims away the moments that make the saga shine. This abridged retelling cuts out countless gags, action scenes, and key moments, including the introductions of Blackbeard, Bellamy, and many other things. Given Skypiea’s significance in the current One Piece anime and manga, it’s far better to watch the full 43-episode saga than this rushed special.

4. One Piece: Heart of Gold
This TV special, directed by Tatsuya Nagamine, follows Olga, a young girl hunted by both the World Government and the ruthless wealth-seeker Mad Treasure, who holds the secret to Pure Gold — a legendary substance said to grant immortality and cure any illness. Olga joins the Straw Hat Pirates on a wild journey to the lost island of Alchemi, hidden inside the stomach of a colossal anglerfish named Bonbori. While it’s an entertaining adventure, it’s more of a middle-of-the-road story, and isn’t essential viewing before One Piece Film: Gold, even though they’re loosely connected.

3. One Piece: Adventure of Nebulandia
This TV special is often seen as the spiritual successor to the beloved non-canon G8 arc. Like its predecessor, it’s engaging and entertaining, giving some of the lesser-highlighted Straw Hats their moment to shine and adding fun world-building without interfering with the main story. The plot follows the return of the Foxy Pirates, who want a rematch against the Straw Hats, until the Marines step in and whisk some crew members away to Nebulandia, an island that nullifies Devil Fruit powers.

2. One Piece: 3D2Y: Overcome Ace’s Death! Luffy’s Vow to his Friends
3D2Y: Overcome Ace's Death! Luffy's Vow to His Friends is a One Piece TV special that covers Luffy’s two-year training period after the Marineford arc. While it’s an entertaining recap with fun non-canonical moments, like the origin of Luffy’s Red Hawk technique and a peek into a battle between two admirals, it can spoil events for viewers who haven’t caught up to the Dressrosa arc in the main story. This one is a better watch after knowing everything that happens, if you need a quick recap and want some improved animation over the original series.

1. One Piece Film: Gold
2016’s One Piece Film: Gold, directed by Tatsuya Nagamine and co-written by series creator Eiichiro Oda, is widely considered one of the best One Piece films, especially due to Oda’s involvement. The Straw Hat Pirates set sail for Gran Tesoro, a glittering, over-the-top amusement park on a massive ship, only to clash with the cunning casino boss Gild Tesoro, who uses his devil powers to control the city. With no world-ending stakes, the film is a more laid-back and fun watch. Watching the crew revel in the casino is a blast, and Tesoro proves to be a surprisingly compelling villain.
