Publisher Annapurna Interactive, known for bringing us games like Stray, Outer Wilds, and Kentucky Route Zero, held a new Annapurna Direct showcase on Tuesday ahead of this year's Tokyo Game Show, where it revealed three new games. Those titles are as diverse, visually striking, and intriguing as Annapurna's memorable output over the past decade, and includes a turn-based musical role-playing game whose creator (maybe half-jokingly) likened it to "Clair Obscur meets KPop Demon Hunters." Read on to see what was revealed at Annapurna Direct for Tokyo Game Show. All three titles will be playable at the annual gaming convention later this week.
D-topia
D-topia is a gently paced puzzle-adventure game in which players work as a Facilitator, tending to the D-topia residential facility that is — at least on its face — a "seemingly perfect society managed by A.I." D-topia's puzzles focus on exploration and "nuanced choices that uncover the human heart of this perfectly happy world," Annapurna says. Developed by Marumittu Games, D-topia will be released sometime in 2026 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox Series X.
People of Note
People of Note, a turn-based RPG musical from Iridium Studios, is pitched as a "full-fledged musical condensed into a video game." The game's story is told through musical means, yes, but so are the battle and game mechanics. Musicals! You love 'em or hate 'em, but you have to appreciate the ambition of People of Note. People of Note is slated for release in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox Series X.
Demi and the Fractured Dream
A classic action-adventure love letter with shades of 3D Legend of Zelda games, Journey, and Devil May Cry, Demi and the Fractured Dream casts players as a "voidsent born into the world of Somnus seeking the way to escape his cursed fate." Expect nostalgic hack-and-slash combat and environmental puzzle solving when Demi and the Fractured Dream launches on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store), and Xbox Series X in 2026.
