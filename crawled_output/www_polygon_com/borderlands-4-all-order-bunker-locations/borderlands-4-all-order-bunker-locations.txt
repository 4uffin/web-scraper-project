Order bunkers are small dungeons in Borderlands 4 hidden behind doors that are covered with an impenetrable shield. The ultimate answer to every problem in the game — shooting things — won’t help you with these. You can, however, unlock them by using a vial filled with locust, a special substance that breaks this type of shield. To help you find these dungeons, we’ve prepared this Borderlands 4 guide with all the Order bunker locations and how to unlock each one.
All Order bunker locations in Borderlands 4
Order bunkers are, in general, simple dungeons where you pass over a few rooms filled with enemies before facing the boss. While you might have to press a button on a panel to open a door or find a battery to charge a computer, bunkers are pretty straightforward. By completing an Order bunker, you not only receive experience points and weapons, but you also gain 40 SDU tokens. You will only have the chance to go after Order bunkers once you have completed the “One Fell Swoop” mission. When going after the Order bunker, if you want to keep track of their exact location in Kairos, you should check our interactive map. Below, you find a list of all the Order bunkers in Borderlands 4:
Blacklime Bunker (The Howl)
The Crawlcroft (Grindstone of the Worthy)
Tipping Point (Ideolator's Noose)
Craven's Nook (Heart of the Mountain)
Ironwall Resolve (Terminus District)
The Wireworks (The Low Keys)
Blacklime Bunker

The Blacklime Bunker is located southwest of the Shut-Eye Keep Safehouse, hidden in a cave in the Howl region. To open it, you need to throw the locust vial on the peak south of it. You can either grab it and fly toward the gate or try to hit the gate from the peak itself.

The Crawlcroft
Accessing the Crawlcroft Order bunker requires you to invade an Order base in the Grindstone of the Worthy area. If you have unlocked the Rustical Hurl Silo, then it'll be a quick trip.

Although there are many enemies in this area, you can choose to simply ignore them and, after crossing the main gate, turn left southwest to find the entrance of a cave.

Follow the only available path and drop to the lower level. At the end of the corridor, you will find the Order bunker. The locust vial is located to the west, behind you when facing the gate.
Tipping Point
The quickest route to Tipping Point is by teleporting to Wyclef's Reprieve Safehouse and heading west.

To find the locust vial, you need to go west of the door and pass over the giant propeller to enter a vent tunnel.

Turn right and follow the short path until you find a door that takes you to the upper part of the building. The locust vial is inside the next room. Use the hole in the ground beside it to quickly reach the door and throw the vial.

Craven's Nook
The path to Craven's Nook is shorter if you start from Bones of Sanctuary in the Heart of the Mountain region. Head north and, once inside the cave, use your grappling hook to reach the entrance.

The locust vial is located to the west on a small platform, which you can spot by looking downward from the edge of the area where the bunker is. You want to get close to the edge enough for the command to pull a vial to prompt. With one in hand, throw it at the bunker's gate to open it.

Ironwall Resolve
The Ironwall Resolve Order bunker is found in the Terminus District area, and the quickest path is by using the Frantic Scrawl fast travel. You arrive at the bunker by going south of it.

Before you go after this bunker, you must complete the “One Gassy Issue” side quest, which you start by talking to Beth north of Sumpview Falls Safehouse in Fades District. By helping her, you turn the locust gas system on. Otherwise, the locust vial won’t be available for you to open the bunker.

Once the quest is done, you can head to the Ironwall Resolve Order bunker. The locus vial is located on the northeast side of the plaza, where the entrance is, to the left of where you enter the area. Grab the vial and run back to the entrance to unlock it.

The Wireworks
You can find the Wireworks Order bunker in the Low Keys region, and the closest place you can fast travel to is the Nightcap Safehouse. From there, you need to go south to find the bunker.

To access the Wireworks Order bunker, you need to go south, up the hill, and find a platform to your left. Glide from it to another platform in the northwest. From there, glide to the elevator platform and climb the wall to reach the entrance.

The locust vial is right at the elevator platform where you land, but you can't climb the wall while holding it. You must throw it to the upper level, aiming toward the gate.

Do you need more help with Borderlands 4? For those who are new to Kairos, check out our beginner’s guide before you get started and our best classes guide to find the right one for your playstyle. If you want to have fun with your weapons, be sure to read our guide on how to get more SDU tokens. We know that traversing the immense map of Kairos is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a vehicle, as well as fast travel points. And if you're already enjoying the endgame of Borderlands 4, don’t forget to check the weekly reset time for all current challenges.
