So long-a, Bowser! Nintendo announced Thursday that current Nintendo of America president and chief operating officer Doug Bowser will retire from the company on Dec. 31, putting an end to six years' worth of jokes about his surname. Bowser will be succeeded by Devon Pritchard, a 19-year veteran of the video game industry. Pritchard is currently NOA’s executive vice president of revenue, marketing, and consumer experience. She joined Nintendo in 2006. "One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong," Bowser said in a statement released by Nintendo. "Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers." Bowser joined Nintendo in 2015, after stints at Electronic Arts and Procter & Gamble. He was appointed president and COO of Nintendo of America in 2019, succeeding Reggie Fils-Aime. Under his leadership, Bowser oversaw the launch of Nintendo Switch 2 and expansion into entertainment ventures such as theme parks and films. "Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself," Bowser said. "She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights." "I am humbled and excited to take on this new role," said Pritchard. "Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family." In another role update at Nintendo of America, Satoru Shibata will join the organization as CEO, while continuing his roles as managing executive officer and corporate director, member of the board at Nintendo Co., Ltd. Shibata previously served as president of Nintendo of Europe between 2000 and 2018. There has been no change to the giant menacing turtle Bowser's position within the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario's nemesis will continue to serve in his dual roles as Lord Bowser and King of the Koopas, as he has done since 1985, a source within the Goomba army tells Polygon.
