The Hollow Knight: Silksong map is a dense, sprawling maze full of things that want to kill you (bugs, bigger bugs, even bigger bugs) and things that don't want to kill you but end up doing so anyway (spikes, pits, that sort of thing). No doubt about it, Pharloom is a dangerous place. Along the way, though, you'll find lots of helpful people and places. Benches heal you and act as respawn points. Vendors sell you items in exchange for rosaries. Bellways let you fast travel. Our Hollow Knight: Silksong interactive map is a vital tool that'll help you progress through the main story and 100% the game. We've got you covered with quest locations for "Flexile Spines" and the entirety of the Twisted Bud line, along with easy-to-follow routes for deliveries like "Great Taste of Pharloom" and "Liquid Lacquer." Additionally, you can find items that will make you and your needle stronger like Pale Oil, crests, and abilities. Bear in mind that this map is a work in progress as we continue to play through the game and discover its mysteries. Our most recent update, published Sept. 18, has added more locations for bosses, a ton of collectibles like Bellhome decor, and items that are only found in Act 3. Below, see our Hollow Knight: Silksong interactive map for Pharloom. [Ed. note: Spoilers follow for Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you'd like to discover the game at your own pace, bookmark this page and come back later.]
