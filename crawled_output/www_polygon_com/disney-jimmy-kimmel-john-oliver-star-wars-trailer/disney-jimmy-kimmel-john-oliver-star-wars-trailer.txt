At the top of Monday morning, Disney and Lucasfilm dropped the first trailer for their highly anticipated Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu. The 2026 blockbuster will pick up where the Disney Plus series left off back in 2023, which these days feels like a long, long time ago in a news-cycle galaxy far, far away. Instead of feeling like a massive event, the first look at Mandalorian and Grogu feels more like the media conglomerate version of Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Force handwave — a “These are not the droids you are looking for” for a media-conglomerate controversy. On Sept. 17, Disney, which owns ABC, announced that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be pulled from the air after host Jimmy Kimmel referred to “the MAGA gang” in connection with the suspected shooter of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. The move has been framed by critics as corporate capitulation to intimidation from FCC chair Brendan Carr and the Trump administration. The backlash was immediate and harsh, first with calls for reversals, then boycotts after Disney’s sustained silence. Maybe a new Star Wars trailer could heal? When Mandalorian and Grogu arrives next summer, the blockbuster stands to pay off the revitalizing work of director Jon Favreau and Star Wars story master Dave Filoni. It’s exciting, but not so exciting that the trailer release hasn’t caught the attention of fuming fans who think they’re now the ones being placated. None of this would seem devious if not for trade-reporting on the fact that Disney apparently sat on the trailer in the wake of Kimmel’s dismissal. An unusual Monday morning drop, forecast with little fanfare, makes the release timing all the more suspect. (Polygon has reached out to Disney for comment and clarification on the timeline of the trailer release, and we will update this story with any response.) If Disney thought a Star Wars trailer was bigger than the backlash might be by Sunday night, John Oliver showed up to prove the company wrong. During his Sept. 21 broadcast of Last Week Tonight, Oliver followed Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and even Jimmy Fallon (ish) in standing on his late-night comedy soap box to decry the placating actions of the Walt Disney Corporation. Over 27 minutes, Oliver analyzed the situation as an alarming case of censorship, scorched Disney’s continued tendencies to indulge the Trump administration — including a $15 million legal settlement in late 2024 — and made multiple references to Donald Duck’s anatomically correct corkscrew penis. But his rant wasn’t all facts and figures; by the end, Oliver made a very clear statement to his audience: If you don’t like when a giant corporation silences a critic of an American president, do something about it.
“As for Disney, I'd argue they need to stand by Kimmel and his staff,” Oliver said. “And there are ways that you can encourage them to do that. You could exert pressure on them by canceling Disney Plus or Hulu. And you can be specific about it because it turns out there's actually a box when you cancel, where you can tell them exactly why you are doing it. So you could easily write, say, ‘cowardice in the face of pressure’ or ‘refusing to protect freedom of speech’ or ‘Donald Duck's corkscrew penis.’” Oliver fanned a fire that was flaring up every hour over the weekend. Some of Disney’s biggest stars have now openly broken ranks to support Kimmel, including The Avengers star Mark Ruffalo, who warned on Threads that Disney’s stock would “go down a lot further” if the suspension becomes permanent, adding that the company “does not want to be the ones that broke America.” Tatiana Maslany, who headlined She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, went further, urging followers to cancel their subscriptions in protest. Olivia Rodrigo, a former Disney Channel star whose concert film driving home 2 u is also on Disney Plus, called the suspension “blatant censorship and abuse of power.” Fantastic Four actor Pedro Pascal took to Instagram to stand in solidarity. Writers who have worked for the company went even longer, as they are prone to do. Damon Lindelof, who has spearheaded everything from ABC’s Lost to Disney’s Tomorrowland and a shelved Star Wars movie, posted a lengthy defense of Kimmel, vowing he could not “in good conscience work for the company that imposed” the suspension. In a Deadline op-ed, Andor writer Dan Gilroy tied the moment directly to the authoritarian themes in their series, with Dan warning that Disney’s compliance amounted to “pavement for the road to a brave new Trumpian world.” The rage has spilled over into real life, with protests popping up outside Disney offices and a sharp rise in Google searches for “cancel Disney Plus” and “cancel Hulu.”
Maybe the speeches and quips won’t leave a mark. Maybe Disney will succeed in trying to serve society’s four quadrants. Maybe a new Star Wars trailer does heal. As of Monday, it’s unclear if Kimmel will return to airwaves as negotiations over the future of his late-night show remain ongoing. But also, as of Monday, the debate around Disney's decision to proactively avoid the Trump administration's wrath has not moved on — regardless of a Mandalorian-sized trailer drop. Even in the Star Wars subreddit, a place that’s usually home to pure salivation and hype, eager fans are bemoaning the choices they’ll face in 2026. “Shame, would've loved to have seen this. Right your wrongs Disney and maybe I'll consider supporting your projects again.” “I'm not giving Disney another dime until they decide to get back on the right side of history,” said another. Many more expletives followed. We know little about the direction of The Mandalorian and Grogu other than it probably won’t combat fascism as overtly as Andor, but still exists in the Star Wars universe, where evil forces aim to control the lives of interplanetary innocents. It is a political franchise even at its most pulpy, which makes Disney’s choice to drop a Mandalorian and Grogu trailer on the heels of censorship backlash even stranger. If it’s a tactic to subdue heat, it’s not working. If it wasn’t, it’s an uncomfortable reminder that the situation has still not been resolved. And while a few fans on Reddit are wondering if we’ll really see Mando fight an IRL Mantellian savrip, a creature from Chewbacca’s dejarik board, most of them just want some answers about Kimmel. The question is: Can Star Wars devotees, at the end of the day, truly resist enough to leave a dent in Disney's earnings? But in terms of sentiment, Oliver channeled most of what is brewing on Star Wars channels across the internet a full 12 hours before The Mandalorian and Grogu trailer. “History is also going to remember the cowards who definitely knew better, but still let things happen,” he remarked. “And I will say this, if we've learned nothing else from this administration's second term so far, and I don't think we have, is that giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go away.”

Bot comments abound today it seems. These people aren't real and it isn't hard to tell. Fragile masks on bots to make you think you're outnumbered.Thank you Matt Patches for an article that doesn't fall for the trick they tried to pull. Most real people here are on your side with it, I think.

Disney may have made the final decision, but they would have had to take into account Nexstar and Sinclair's desire for separate merger deals. Those two companies own many local ABC affiliates.

I loved the Mandalorian.Unfortunately you can can only unsubscribe once, and since I'm already boycotting them.. shrug emoji. I won't be resubscribing for it though, that much is absolutely certain. They need to wake up - apeasing the rump is not good business, and we need to show them that.

I was mad about Kimmel, mad at Disney for giving in to intimidation, but also excited about the Mando trailer & movie.What you're describing are issues of the terminally online.Did it cross my mind for a brief second when I saw the trailer drop? Yes. I chuckled & half rolled my eyes. Then I clicked play & said "looks like a fun flick."

And where do you think bending the knee ends? We're already seeing an assault on games in terms of censorship. If you think it's just adult games please remember that
banning GTA is one of Collective Shouts most ambitious goals.

No idea how the author drew any comparison from Kimmel/Politics to Star Wars. Overall, Kimmel's firing will have a negligible effect on Disney's streaming subscribers.

Read the article. There is no comparison. It's an opinion piece about how Disney held back the Star Wars trailer after the Kimmel decision, instead of airing it the day of.

ReptarRampage There's no evidence that happened. Even the link they offer doesn't support that, it just has someone saying they were sitting on it.
They've had it ready for awhile I'm sure & in the end they dropped it when they all but already brought Kimmel back.

giving the bully your lunch money doesn't make him go awayWhat if the bully is the guy comparing a person who was assassinated to a dead goldfish?When is society as a WHOLE going to stand up to this by saying, you are free to say what you want but this is unacceptable.What if the
reaction of the death of George Floyd was compared to the death of a goldfish.
Would we demand anything, would there be protest?Although everyone at this site may feel Kimmel was wronged remember, a lot of people are tired of his democratic state run monologues and don't think Disney should be required to pay him millions for the rest of his life.

My guy, how can Kimmel be giving state-run monologues when the state is adamantly against him? When the state was brandishing penalties like they were the Sword of Damocles dangling over their heads? What world are you living in?

That was a joke about how trump wasn't showing respect for his supposed dead friend.
Seems it musta went right over your head.
No surprise since u think his monologues are state sponsored when they stand up against the state all the time.
It's funny how before Trump, it was always fair game for late nite hosts to mock our presidents. Bush voters could still laugh at his mistakes. Clinton voters could laugh at the non-stop jokes at his expense over how he handled the Monica Lewinsky affair.
But suddenly Trump comes along and his voters take offense?

Talk about revisionist history. Jimmy Kimmel made a knowingly false, slanderous statement which made ABC/Disney liable for damages. When Kimmel started his nightly far-left rant, it was already known who the shooter was, who his allies are, and what his motives were. By making proclamations to the contrary, his words were going to cost the company tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in legal damages. Kimmel forced his employers hand. Not to mention, it was the companies that actually pay for Disney/ABC broadcasts that rejected Kimmel. They told Disney they wouldn’t be airing inflammatory, slanderous political rants. The left doesn’t seem to able to comprehend what free speech actually means. Free Speech means the government cannot make any laws preventing you from saying what you want, nor can they force you to say something. Private companies are not required to let you say whatever you want. This is just another failed, far left political talk show host being removed from the air for cause. It’s hilarious so many people are claiming to support Kimmel, yet viewership data shows none of you actually watch his show. The average age of viewership is well north of 60, although not as bad as Colbert 68. At least the couple of people falling asleep with ABC tuned in were watching…

Please quote or show where in the monologue video that Kimmel said the false, slanderous statement that made ABC/Disney liable for damages. Go on, we'll wait. Bring the receipts.

There’s so much wrong with your statement that it’d be a waste of time to dissect everything incorrect about it, so I’m gonna switch it back to Star Wars to see if some heavy-handed allegory can break through the thick skin you’ve managed to swaddle your cerebellum in:Do you remember how Syril Karn from Andor dedicated his life to the Empire? How he lost his job for doing the right thing, instead of showing blind loyalty to his supervisors? How that just made him double down on wanting to work in the system, convinced that the corruption he faced was a fluke and not the intended outcome? How he forced himself to swallow propaganda because he knew the alternative was being shunned, how he saw the suffering of innocent people and chose to condone it anyway, and how he ultimately wasted his life getting pushed back and forth by other people even when he was convinced he was in charge of his own actions? How did that work out for him?Right now, you and I are standing in Rix Road, both fully capable of seeing exactly what is happening to the world around us; we can either submit, or we can refuse to comply with the monster cloaked in the Republic’s skin. You ready to wake up yet?

The only thing I think is misrepresented in this case is that they are pushing that Kimmel attacked Kirk. In my opinion he didnt, but he DID attack President Trump relentlessly, which is probably what got him in trouble. Bad timing Im sure.

“Revisionist history? Mate, that’s exactly what you’re doing here. Kimmel didn’t ‘force Disney’s hand’—networks pull talent all the time for business reasons, ratings, or shifting formats. Pretending this was some kind of catastrophic legal liability is pure speculation with zero evidence. If there was an actual slander suit in play, you’d be able to cite it, not just wave your hands about ‘hundreds of millions.’And the free speech bit—ironically you explained it yourself but still missed the point. Free speech protects against government censorship, not against public criticism, not against sponsors walking, not against networks making programming choices. Nobody’s confused about that except the people shouting ‘free speech’ every time a company makes a commercial decision.As for viewership demographics—welcome to late-night television. It’s been skewing older for years, no matter the host or network. That doesn’t change the fact that these shows shape public conversation far beyond the Nielsen chart.Bottom line: if you don’t like Kimmel, don’t watch him. But let’s not dress up personal dislike as some grand legal or constitutional crusade. That’s the real revisionism here.”
