"Berry Picking" is one of the first tasks that you'll encounter in Hollow Knight: Silksong. In Bone Bottom, you'll find Moss Druid, who is cackling away in a cave as they stir their mysterious pot. They'll send you on a quest to find three mossberries from the moss-covered areas of Pharloom, but they can be a bit tricky to find and collect. Here's how to complete the "Berry Picking" task in Hollow Knight: Silksong and where to find all three mossberries. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

To start the "Berry Picking" quest, you'll need to interact with Moss Druid, who can be found in a little cave near the top right section of Bone Bottom.

However, to enter her cave, you'll need to unlock the Silkspear ability first, which can be found at the top of the large room just outside of her cave. After you unlock the ability, drop down to the bottom floor of the room and head as far to the right as possible. You'll run into a silk barrier that you'll need to break with your newly found Silkspear ability. Continue to the right to enter Moss Druid's cave and interact with them to start the quest.
Mossberry locations
There are three mossberries that you can find nearby. Two can be found in Moss Grotto, while the other can be found above the first village in Bone Bottom.
Mossberry #1 (Moss Grotto)

The first mossberry can be found almost immediately after you start the game. Head down to Moss Grotto by dropping into the hole to the left of the Bone Bottom village, and enter the area to the left. Platform your way to the higher level and continue forward until you reach a staircase-like platform. Jump onto the platform and follow the path ahead to find the first mossberry at the end.
Mossberry #2 (Moss Grotto)

The second mossberry can be found shortly after the first. At the top of the rightmost area in Moss Grotto, you'll find a mossberry that is a little out of reach. However, there is a flying enemy nearby that you can use to boost yourself upwards. To do that, you'll need to hit the bug with a downward aerial attack, which is also known as a pogo attack. As Hornet's downward attack sends her down diagonally, it might take a bit of getting used to for Hollow Knight veterans. Wait for the bug enemy to plunge downwards, pogo off of their head, and quickly slash upwards at the mossberry to knock it down. Make sure to pick it up before you head off!
Mossberry #3 (Above Bone Bottom Village)

The third mossberry is a little bit trickier to find and grab as it's actually hidden inside a bug's mouth. To reach this area, you'll need to pass Shakra, who is the map vendor, in The Marrow and continue up and to the left until you return to Bone Bottom. Progress through this next area and head downwards when you can. From here, drop down the platforms until you reach an elevator. Make sure to hit its switch as it'll take you to the Bone Bottom village and back, and it'll be very helpful in just a second.

Continue to the right and hop across the platforms, defeating any enemy along the way. Afterward, look downwards by holding down until you spot another bug creature holding a glowing green object in its mouth. Your goal is to pogo the bug until you defeat it, and it will drop the mossberry onto the ground. Similar to the second mossberry, this might take some time as the diagonal attack can be a little hard to get used to. Additionally, if you're not able to pogo the enemy consecutively, don't fret! Head to the left of the village, just before the hole, and the elevator will come down to pick you up. Ride it back up to the top and try again until you successfully defeat the enemy. Pick up the third mossberry, and head back to Moss Druid.

After you turn in all three mossberries to Moss Druid, you'll receive the Druid's Eye, which can be placed into one of your blue slots on your crest. The Druid's Eye will partially fill your silk bar with a green elixir after you take any damage. This crest is particularly useful for the early game as you're getting used to Silksong's mechanics and enemies. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
