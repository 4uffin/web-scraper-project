To unlock the wall jump ability in Hollow Knight: Silksong, you must obtain Cling Grip, one of the Ancestral Arts. The wall jump makes it far easier to reach high areas, so it’s an essential ability to obtain, but beware that the route to the Cling Grip is difficult, confusing, and packed with enemies. But don't let that deter you! This guide will show you how to find the Cling Grip location and unlock the wall jump in Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.
Wall jump (Cling Grip ability) location in Silksong
Cling Grip, an ability that unlocks the wall jump, is found at the top of the Shellwood region. This is the region west of Greymoor and Bellhart and north of Bone Bottom and The Marrow. We'll give you a detailed route description below, but if you're just looking for the Cling Grip location on the Hollow Knight: Silksong map, here it is:

Before you start, it’s best to bring at least 100 rosaries with you so you can purchase the Shellwood map and unlock a resting bench later on.
How to unlock wall jump (Cling Grip) in Silksong
Starting in Greymoor, continue west past Halfway Home (Nuu and Creige’s house), and defeat the Moorwing boss, who's located in the bottom left.

Continue west through Bellhart. You can’t speak with the NPCs until you’ve completed the "The Threadspun Town" quest, but it’s fine to do that later (be sure to rest at the bench, though). For now, head into Shellwood. In the large open area with the platforms, head all the way to the left until you reach the opposite wall. Then, platform to the right and back up to the left to find an exit.

While moving upward, try to fill your Silk bar by slaying the smaller enemies before you exit the large room in the top left, as you’ll have to drop down into a boss arena. Rather than one large boss, you must defeat a bunch of smaller enemies:

Wave one: Two poisonous flowers. Hit them (twice if you’re fast), then move away to avoid the poison burst.
Wave two: Two stick bugs armed with daggers. Try to jump over them and hit them with downwards attacks, or — probably safer — use your tools.
Wave three: Two stick bugs and one poisonous flower. It’s hard to avoid the stick bugs’ attacks without jumping right into the poison, so try to lure the sticks to one end of the room, jump over, and defeat the flower first.
Before you leave this room through the western exit, unlock the resting bench above the boss arena, right here:

In the room to the left, take the elevator to the bottom, then take the exit to the west to find Shakra and purchase the Shellwood map.

After that, jump across the white flowers using a downwards attack. In the next room, take the path upwards on the left side:
Graphic: Marloes Valentina Stella/Polygon | Source images: Team Cherry via Polygon
Leave this room at the top right, then keep going east, ignoring everything else until you reach a room with an upward and a downward path. Go upward, and you’ll find an elevator leading you back to the resting bench. Take a quick rest before moving up again and leaving to the right. Now you don’t have to jump across those pesky flowers again!

Next stop: the Sister Splinter boss arena. Continue east until you can go no further. Move up, to the left, and jump across the white flowers to reach the left exit.

The Sister Splinter boss mainly relies on downward slash attacks while hanging from the ceiling, so be ready to dash to the side. There’s a lot of opportunity to hit the boss between her attacks, but move away as soon as she draws her claws back in a “charging” motion. To make this fight a fair bit harder, Sister Splinter will summon thorny branches to block your way; although her own attacks will destroy them too, you may have to slash through them so you don’t get stuck underneath her. It’ll take two or three hits to break them. Occasionally, Sister Splinter will spawn minions to aid her. It’s best to reserve your tools and Silk-consuming attacks for these fellows, as their presence makes it very difficult to avoid the thorns and Sister Splinter’s slashing attacks. Take them down as soon as you can!

Following this boss fight, continue to the west. You must exit the next room on the top left, so drop down a bit, move left, and go up again, following the white flowers.

Cross the water to the left, break the branches blocking the doorway, and continue to the left. When you reach the left wall, go upward to the right (break the blocked doorways like before), and exit this room in the top right.

See the large doorway just ahead of you? Interact with it to (finally!) obtain the Cling Grip. ability

To wall jump in Hollow Knight: Silksong, jump against a wall as you normally would, but instead of dropping down, you can press the jump button again to jump even higher. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
