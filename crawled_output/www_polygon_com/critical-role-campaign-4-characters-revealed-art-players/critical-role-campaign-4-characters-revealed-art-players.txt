If you've been scouring the deepest dungeons for more news about Critical Role's Campaign 4, then look no further: The beloved tabletop adventuring group has fully revealed their Campaign 4 characters after some cryptic teases, and, as expected from a Dungeons & Dragons adventuring party, they look as unique and wacky as ever. Only last week did Critical Role tease the class and characters that the 13-player group would be playing as. We took a stab at guessing ourselves, but sadly, we came up short. On the plus side, the actual characters are leagues better and far more unique than our guesswork. The reveal of Campaign 4's characters was unveiled on social media platforms, including X and Instagram. You can look at the art yourself, below.
The full list of characters, and who they're played by, is as follows:
Sir Julien Davinos - Matthew Mercer
Teor Pridesire - Travis Willingham
Murray Mag'nesson - Marisha Ray
Bolaire Lathalia - Taliesin Jaffe
Vaelus - Ashley Johnson
Halandil Fang - Liam O'Brien
Wicander Halovar - Sam Riegel
Thimble - Laura Bailey
Azune Nayar - Luis Carazo
Kattigan Vale - Robbie Daymond
Occtis Tachonis - Alexander Ward
Thaisha Lloy - Aabria Iyengar
Tyranny - Whitney Moore
These new adventurers will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan on a brand-new journey, separate from the previous three campaigns set in the world of Exandria. Already, fans are putting things together, such as the classes that each character will be. Thanks to previous videos and images shared, Critters have already pieced together that Halandil Fang will be a bard, and Thaisha Lloy, a druid. Looking at the character art, we also speculate that Kattigan Vale will be a ranger of some sort, and Sir Julien Davinos looks to be a duelist. The designs of these new characters come from Loren Hontanilla, and they're all utterly gorgeous. We can't wait to see more of them when Critical Role Campaign 4 premieres on Oct. 2. Beacon users will have instant access on Beacon.tv, with simultaneous streams on Critical Role’s YouTube and Twitch channels. VODs will be available for all viewers the following Monday.

That character looks like something that in 20 years will be seen as an offensive caricature.
