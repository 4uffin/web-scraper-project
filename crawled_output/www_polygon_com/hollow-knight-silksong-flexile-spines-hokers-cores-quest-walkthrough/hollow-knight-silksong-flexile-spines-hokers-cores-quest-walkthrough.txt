The key to completing the “Flexile Spines” quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is figuring out what a Hoker is so you can collect their Spine Cores. Give 25 Spine Cores to the Seamstress in Far Fields, and you’ll receive a game-changing ability. Here's how to pick up the "Flexile Spines" quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong and where to find the Hokers and their Spine Cores. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

After reaching the Far Fields region, which is east of the Deep Docks, continue east until you’re in the large open area with the massive balloon-like house. Enter this house and speak with the Seamstress to start the “Flexile Spines” quest.
'Flexile Spines' quest walkthrough in Hollow Knight: Silksong
To complete “Flexile Spines," you must gather 25 Spine Cores, an item dropped by Hokers. Luckily, the Hokers are quite nearby; right after exiting the Seamstress’ house, drop down the hanging platforms to your right, and take the exit to the east, right this way:

See the floating spikey creatures in the next room? These are the Hokers you’re looking for. As you can see, they carry a bunch of sharp spikes on their body, which they’ll fire off when you hit them. The exact number and direction of the spikes change whenever the Hokers regenerate them, but there are always four or six of them.

The Hoker in the picture above carries four spikes and will fire them to the upper and lower left, and upper and lower right. Since one of them is directly pointed at Hornet’s position, it’s best to stand underneath this Hoker and hit it with an upwards strike. Beware, however, that the Hokers’ bodies won’t just drop a bunch of Spine Cores upon defeat; instead, you must hit the spikes shot by the Hokers. So, hit the Hoker, avoid the spikes, then walk over to all the spikes within reach and hit them again to pick them up as an item.

Hokers regenerate their spikes after each hit, and it takes about three hits before they die. After defeating five to seven Hokers or so, you should have enough to complete “Flexile Spines." Head back to the Seamstress’ house to hand in the quest, or, if you need more Hokers, sit on the bench inside her home to regenerate them.
'Flexile Spines' quest reward in Hollow Knight: Silksong
As a reward for completing "Flexile Spines," the Seamstress will give you the Drifter’s Cloak, allowing you to glide after jumping and ride air streams. To activate this ability, hold the jump button while airborne. Especially in combination with the Swift Step sprinting and dashing ability, the Drifter’s Cloak unlocks a far better horizontal reach. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
