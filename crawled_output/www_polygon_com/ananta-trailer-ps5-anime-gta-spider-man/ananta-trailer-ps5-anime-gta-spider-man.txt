Ananta is one of the strangest mashups in gaming yet — an open-world RPG draped in anime style that feels like Grand Theft Auto 5, Yakuza, Marvel's Spider-Man, and Watch Dogs fused into one. Developed by Naked Rain and published by NetEase, the open-world game puts players in control of four ADP task force officers, each with unique skills for maintaining order in Nova City. The Captain takes center stage, and is shown brawling with gangs, going undercover, swinging between skyscrapers with Venom-like tendrils, and even squaring off against a towering mecha straight out of Metal Gear Solid. Like GTA 5, the trailer shifts perspectives between playable characters: a female officer (Richie) patrolling at night and arresting suspects, a masked operative (Seymour) hacking systems in Watch Dogs–style, and a sharpshooter with bunny ears (Taffy) providing cover during a tense hostage standoff. Expect to be able to jack cars, choose from a number of assorted weapons, from guns all the way to tennis rackets, from your weapon wheel, and as much debauchery as you can imagine, all with an anime tinge. There's also a ton of minigames to do when you're not out busting crime, like playing basketball, having fun at the beach, and skydiving? There's even a Power Slap-like minigame. NetEase has been in hot water before for allegedly copying other games, but this time around, collecting the best aspects of several open-world titles and presenting them with its own anime identity has seemingly paid off. The nearly eight-minute trailer showcases a tongue-in-cheek parody world reminiscent of Saints Row, but infused with unmistakable anime flair and humor. If the controls hold up as well as the style, this could be the closest thing to an anime-inspired GTA before Grand Theft Auto 6. Although there is currently no release date, Ananta is in development for Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC. Here's a look back at the game's announcement trailer for more.

I was excited for this until I saw that it was a f2p gacha game. Any amount of interest I had went out the window knowing that they'll lock the best parts of the game behind grind, paywall, forced timed interactions ect...I know people will disagree with me, but I'd rather see $80 full video games designed as a complete package beginning to end, than something "free" with game design elements intended to hijack psychology and extract maximum cash and engagement.

Some of my fav games have been f2p, it's much safer bet than shelling out $80 for a game and then realizing you don't like it. Even though I've been playing Genshin for years, I honestly haven't spent that much on it and have been just fine. Do I have every single character maxed out? Nope. Do I need to? very much no. Naraka was another example, I had a blast with it, did just fine playing through and getting what I get, I'm sure with this game will be the same.

From what I've read, as of right now, the devs are saying that the only thing that will be in a pay shop are cosmetics, which I can live with. I hope it stays that way.

I love the vibes of the trailer but it's hard to see all these different parts coming together cohesively, especially since I read somewhere else that it is going to be free to play. But I'm keeping an open mind because that trailer was a lot of fun.

Looks too good to be true but I'd love to be proven wrong Edit:After watching the full trailer I really hope I'm wrong
