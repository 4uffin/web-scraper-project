Respawns are inevitable when you enter the bug-infested world of Pharloom, but with the help of our Hollow Knight: Silksong guide collection, victory is close at hand. Whether you’re trying to navigate the complex map, stacking up on rosaries, or up for a side quest or two, here’s everything you need to make Hornet’s next endeavor a success.
Gear up!
The best way to gain an advantage in Hollow Knight: Silksong is to upgrade the Needle, buy new map parts, and stack up on Shell Shards to replenish your tools. Oh, and don’t forget to grab some rosaries to buy more items while you’re at it!
Quest walkthroughs
Completing the many quests in Hollow Knight: Silksong isn’t just noble, it’s also rewarding. The quest to free Bellhart from its terrible curse is one of the most important tasks, but don’t miss out on the "Berry Picking" and "Garb of the Pilgrims" quests in early game either, as they’ll give you an advantage against the first bosses. When you’re ready to face enemies of a more… capricious nature, try hunting Volatile Flintbeetles or Spine Core Honkers.
