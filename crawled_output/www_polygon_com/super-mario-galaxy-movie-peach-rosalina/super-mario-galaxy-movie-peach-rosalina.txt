While some Nintendo fans expected Mario's next cinematic adventure to explore the wider world of the Mushroom Kingdom and give us more time with Yoshi, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is sequence breaking the franchise right into space. And that shouldn't really be a surprise if you watched The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which already has its fair share of Super Mario Galaxy references. (Remember breakout star Lumalee?) Those allusions to the Super Mario Galaxy games could point to an upcoming reveal about Princess Peach's origin story, and her ties to another princess, Rosalina, who is sure to be a big part of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. The Super Mario Bros. Movie teased Peach's origins back in 2023, when she revealed to Mario that she doesn't know where she hails from. Her earliest memory is arriving via warp pipe to the Mushroom Kingdom as a toddler and being raised by Toads, who ultimately crowned her as their ruler. When Mario posits that maybe she's from his world — aka Brooklyn — she offers an alternative theory: "There’s a huge universe out there, with a lot of galaxies," Peach says.
One widely disseminated theory, put forth by The Game Theorists a decade ago, is that Peach is Rosalina's mother. But given their respective ages (and for the sake of story simplicity in a movie for children), it's more likely that Peach and Rosalina are sisters or cousins. Both princesses lived among a people unlike them; Peach with Toads, and Rosalina with the Luma, who regarded her as their mother. It's clear that Nintendo is going all-in on Rosalina in the coming year. In addition to re-releasing Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch, along with a new Rosalina amiibo, Nintendo is selling a physical version of Rosalina's storybook from Galaxy — with additional pages. Rosalina even appears to be coming to Super Mario Bros. Wonder, as revealed (or rather leaked) in a trailer for the game's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.
(Rosalina is seen very briefly two minutes into the above trailer for Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park.) If Nintendo does confirm some sort of familial relationship between princesses Peach and Rosalina, it would be — in Super Mario terms — a pretty big deal. Nintendo typically keeps its canon pretty light, and seems to ignore previous revelations like Yoshi's "real name" and Mario bullying Wario when they were boys. When Nintendo does try to reckon with canon, we wind up with things like the convoluted Legend of Zelda timeline. But in the Super Mario movie universe, things can be different. The Super Mario Bros. Movie gave us an officially sanctioned look at Mario and Luigi's mom, dad, and extended family, after all. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be released on April 3, 2026.

I thought the Nintendo direct explicitly said the physical book wouldn't have the new pages in them?

I always felt like Rosalina was part of Peach's lineage going back many generations..Also, I appreciate that the Zelda timeline recognices the "player" as an agent, the three-furcation at Ocarina of Time feels like genius to me (your Game Over at the Deku Tree had consequences!), but it has been squandered with either isolated games (Twilight Princess goes kind of nowhere), self-sabotaging entries (Skyward Sword has to null it's own importance by making the Skyward Sword the Master Sword and just sending Fi to a farm up north of Kakariko) and reboots that weren't reboots until they were (looking at you Breath of the Wild; I do appreciate the Gerudo gaining Hylian ears, that's one of the good ones).

Rosalina has never been referred to as a Princess, so far. She's only ever been mistakenly called that by some people because she *looks* like a Mario Princess, based on her outfit. But the games have never actually called her that, ever. Also- the Nintendo Direct specifically mentioned that the physical version of Rosalina's storybook does *not* include the extra pages- they're just added into these new rereleases of the Galaxy games themselves, not the physical book.
