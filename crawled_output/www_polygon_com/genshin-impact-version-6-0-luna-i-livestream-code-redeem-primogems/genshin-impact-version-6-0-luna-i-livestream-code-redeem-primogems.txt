How to redeem Genshin Impact gift codes
Hoyoverse just wrapped up the Genshin Impact version "Luna I" preview livestream, showing off all sorts of details about the upcoming patch. Most importantly, there were several codes that award Primogems and other rewards shown during the stream. Our Genshin Impact "Luna I" livestream code list provides you with the three stream codes for rewards and explains how to redeem them. Notably, this upcoming version is not being called 6.0 by Hoyoverse, but rather "Luna I." The stream showed off Nod-Krai, the upcoming region coming to the game, alongside the Archon Quest, "Song of the Welkin Moon." There are tons of new characters being introduced in this area. We've already gotten Ineffa in the last patch, but this new version will also add the Electro polearm-user, Flins, Dendro catalyst-user, Lauma, and Hydro claymore-user, Aino. There'll also be a set of limited-time challenges to complete as part of the "Clink Clank Clash" event that rewards an event-exclusive weapon, as well as the usual goodies.

You’ll want to redeem these codes quickly, as they expire on Sept. 1 at 12 a.m. EDT. They not only reward Primogems, but they also give Mora and Adventurer’s EXP to level up your characters.
How to redeem Genshin Impact gift codes
To redeem codes, you can log in and input them on the code redemption website. You can also input them in-game through the settings menu, but copy and pasting them in a browser is much easier. You can also click the links above, if you’re logged in on whatever device you’re seeing this post on. Once you redeem the codes, you’ll get the rewards via in-game mail shortly after that.
