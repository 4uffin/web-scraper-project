JoJo's Bizarre Adventure next season got off to a hot start with the first trailer for Steel Ball Run, shown during a special announcement event held on Tuesday, Sept. 23, the same day as the titular race across the United States begins in the story. The anime will air globally on Netflix in 2026. Steel Ball Run is the seventh part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the manga series created in 1987 by Hiroiko Araki, and then turned into an anime by David Production. While the manga was already very popular, the success of the anime turned it into a worldwide phenomenon. Charismatic characters, battles with absurd and intricate powers, and instantly recognizable visuals (often transmitted through iconic poses) all contributed to creating a massive fandom that was waiting for the first glimpse at Steel Ball Run.
Part seven is the first set in the new JoJo continuity that started at the end of part six, Stone Ocean, with a reality-altering event. Fans can thus expect to see familiar names in Steel Ball Run, but these are a lot more than alternate versions of old characters. If you like JoJo, you will surely fall in love with Johnny Joestar, Gyro Zeppeli, and Diego Brando. Set in the United States in the year 1890, the story follows the participants of a race across America, competing for a $50 million prize. Stand powers return, along with a new power system, the Spin, similar to the Hamon waves used in the first two parts of JoJo. Steel Ball Run will be produced by David Production. Yasuhiro Kimura and Hideya Takahashi will direct, with Toshiyuki Karo as overall series director. Daisuke Tsumagari is in charge of character design, and Yugo Kanno of music.
No precise release window has been given, but it's confirmed that Steel Ball Run will air globally on Netflix in 2026.

The ending of Stone Ocean has nothing to do with Steel Ball Run.It's just a different universe completely unrelated to that event.
