'Volatile Flintbeetles' quest location in Hollow Knight: Silksong
'Volatile Flintbeetles' quest walkthrough in Hollow Knight: Silksong
'Volatile Flintbeetles' quest reward in Hollow Knight: Silksong
The “Volatile Flintbeetles” quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is difficult in more than one way. First, you need to locate Flintbeetle dung, then you must follow its lovely aroma, and finally, you must deal with an out-of-control fireball-spewing cannon bug. Oh, and repeat that process two more times. Here's how to start the "Volatile Flintbeetles" quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong and how to find every Volatile Flintbeetle location.
'Volatile Flintbeetles' quest location in Hollow Knight: Silksong
The “Volatile Flintbeetles” quest will become available at the quest board in Bone Bottom, the first village in the game. It’s part of the second batch of Bone Bottom side quests, following the “Garb of the Pilgrims” quest earlier on.

You won’t be able to start “Volatile Flintbeetles” immediately after finishing the first Bone Bottom quests, though. For me, the quest appeared on the board after I’d made my way into the Greymoor area, north of the Far Fields. Beware that you’ll need to pogo your way to the third Volatile Flintbeetle location. If you're having a hard time utilizing the downward aerial attack, we recommend using the Reaper Crest (obtained from the Chapel of the Reaper on the west side of Greymoor) or the Wanderer Crest (obtained in Bonegrave).

To complete “Volatile Flintbeetles,” you must find, track, and defeat three Volatile Flintbeetles in The Marrow. If you’re still at the quest board, just walk east to enter The Marrow. If you’re further away, fast travel to the Marrow’s bell station. If you want, you can track the Volatile Flintbeetles yourself by searching for their aromatic dung, which looks like a pile of glowing stones. Choose “track”, and follow the white vapor that appears, leading you straight to the Volatile Flintbeetle. In the example below, you see the dung on the left, and the vapor trail leading upwards and away from Hornet on the right.

Beware that Volatile Flintbeetles will attack you on sight, so be ready to dodge their fire bombs. It’s best to wait for their attack to end, land a quick hit, and jump away again. Avoid the trail of fire they leave behind as they move, because it’ll explode and harm you. As soon as the Volatile Flintbeetle is down, it’ll drop a Flintgem, which you'll need to complete this quest. The first Volatile Flintbeetle location is at the top of the first room you’ll enter as you leave Bone Bottom. Jump upwards at the first opportunity, and keep going until you reach the ceiling. Hit the glowing stone to spawn the Volatile Flintbeetle.

To reach the second Volatile Flintbeetle location, start from the direction of The Marrow’s fast travel station and walk east. Two rooms further, in the big one with the disappearing platforms, jump upwards. The Volatile Flintbeetle is at the top of the next room, on the right side. To get there, move to the left and jump across the disappearing platforms, this way:

You’ll pass a pile of aromatic dung before finding a large Skull Brute. From there, continue upwards to the right.

Like before, hit the large glowing stone to spawn the Volatile Dungbeetle:

The third and final Volatile Dungbeetle location is in the northeastern part of The Marrow. Start from The Marrow’s bell station, or drop down from the previous Volatile Flintbeetle location until you’re at that same level, and walk to the right. Cross the room with the spikey floor.

When you reach the room with the red balloons, jump to position yourself above them, then use a downwards slash to jump higher up.

Continue up and to the right until you reach a fork in the road where you can either go up or drop down. Make sure to take either path downwards, where you'll find the third Volatile Dungbeetle on the left side of the ground level.

'Volatile Flintbeetles' quest reward in Hollow Knight: Silksong
With three pieces of Flintgem in your pocket, return to the quest board in Bone Bottom to claim your reward for completing the “Volatile Flintbeetles” quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong: a Memory Locket. You can use this to unlock an extra item slot on a Crest, so it's quite powerful!
