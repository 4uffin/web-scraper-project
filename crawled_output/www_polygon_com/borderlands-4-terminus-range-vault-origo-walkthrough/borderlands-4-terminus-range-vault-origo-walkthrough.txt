One of the hidden dungeons in Borderlands 4, the Terminus Range Vault hides not only unique upgrades for your character, but also a challenging boss fight. To visit the other dimension where the Vault is and face all the enemies waiting for you in deadly arenas, you must get your hands on the three key Vault fragments. These lost fragments can be found anywhere in the region of Terminus Range — and searching for all of them might take a while. But don’t fret! We’ve got you covered. In our Borderlands 4 guide, you learn where to find the Terminus Range Vault key fragments, where the Vault door is located, and how to defeat Origo, the Vault’s final boss.
Terminus Range Vault key fragment locations
The three key fragments that you need to open the Terminus Range Vault are in three different areas in this region: Windspear, Low Leys, and Cuspid Climb. To make the process less complicated, you should consider unlocking the Safehouses and Silos that are close to these areas and use our interactive map. Below, you find the maps and locations of the three fragments.
Fragment #1 location
The first key fragment to unlock the Terminus Range Vault is guarded by bulkheads and many other enemies inside the Vestal Garrison on the south side of the Winspear region. The quickest path is by fast-traveling to the Nightcap Safehouse and heading southwest.

While on the outside of the base, go southwest and use a large door to enter the building. Next, you want to turn left, pass over another door, and enter what looks like a control room with big red panels. The key fragment is below the big screen you see when you enter the room.

Fragment #2 location
You can find the altar where the second fragment is in the Low Leys region. The closest Safehouse is the Snowy Wells one. From there, head east until you find an enormous metal arch crossing over a path filled with trees.

If you go northeast following the path below the arch, you will find a large tree with pink leaves on its lower branch. Climb the path beside it and use the grappling hook to reach the upper level where the fragment is located.

Fragment #3 location
The third key fragment is hidden in a cave in the Cuspid Climb region. Because the entrance to the cave is on the highest platform in the area, you can access it by using the balloons of the Reliquary Silo. This specific Silo is located south of it.

Once you have glided your way to the platform, go northeast and kill the Logan guarding the place. Inside the cave, climb the stairs to find a couple of human bodies and the fragment next to them.

Terminus Range Vault door location
Having the three key fragments gives you the chance to find the Terminus Range Vault door and access the Vault of Origo. The best way to start when heading to the door is by fast-traveling to the Heritage Opus Safehouse.

Now, take your vehicle and go northwest. When you enter the Low Leys area, look to your left, toward the west. You will see the entrance of a cave and an Auger Shrine in front of it. You will find the Vault door inside this cave, but you definitely want to activate the shrine to earn some SDU tokens.

How to defeat the Primordial Guardian Origo
Like in the Fadefields Vault and Carcadia Burn Vault, you need to survive a series of encounters against multiple enemies to reach the final arena. In the Terminus Range Vault, Origo will be waiting for you. Origo is a dragon-like creature who has two bars of energy shield instead of regular health, so you want to come to this fight with as many guns with electric damage as you can. Another important detail about this boss is that Origo constantly shifts its element from ice to fire during the fight. Because of that, you also want to bring one fire-based gun and one ice-based gun to the fight. Although it looks badass, Origo is a simple foe to face. You just need to kill it before it kills you. Luckily, it has only a few attacks that offer some risk to your life.

The most common is the ice or fire breath. When the boss is about to use it, Origo presses its wings beside it, goes back a bit, then starts flying forward. Since this is a frontal attack, you just need to dodge sideways to avoid it. There’s a variation of this attack in which the boss uses the fire or ice breath while on the ground. A third variation can also occur, where Origo actually dives into the arena, hitting the ground and damaging anything within a large area around where it lands. There isn’t much to be done to handle this attack besides running. So, yeah, run for your life!

Origo also creates ice spikes and shoots them at you during the fight. If you go below the boss when it’s charging them, you can avoid most of the spikes without too much work. There's a fire variant of this attack, where Origo will move to the center of the arena and start shooting fireballs into the air. They fall on the arena, and after a few seconds, they explode, so you want to stay away from them. A good strategy is to wait for the first fireballs to explode and move to where they were to avoid the others.

Another fire attack Origo can use later in the fight involves creating fire pillars on the ground. You can see a red circle appearing on the ground before the pillar emerges, giving you time to respond to it. While you want to avoid the ice projectiles or fireballs it throws, your main concern should be staying in the air. Throughout the fight, Origo will cover the arena with fire or ice. If you stay too long in certain parts of the arena, it will deal elemental damage to you.

To stay safe all the time, you want to use your grappling hook to open parts of the ground from where a strong air current will come out and throw you in the air. Open these holes whenever you have the chance, since they disappear after a while. By using these air currents and your glide pack, it’s possible to escape most of Origo’s attacks. On the same note, while you’re positioned above Origo thanks to the air currents, you'll want to shoot the spines on the boss’s back. These are the boss’s weak spots, so take advantage of the air currents to hit the boss where it hurts as well! Defeating it will reward you with cash, Eridium, and multiple guns. One of the legendary guns Origo may drop is the “Bonnie and Clyde” assault rifle. Killing the boss at level 41 in the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode rank 2 gave us 2,538 experience points. Completing this vault for the first time will also reward you with a glide pack upgrade, which reduces the cost of dashes and gliding by 50%. Do you need more help with Borderlands 4? For those who are new to Kairos, check out our beginner’s guide before you get started and our best classes guide to find the right one for your playstyle. If you want to have fun with your weapons, be sure to read our guide on how to get more SDU tokens. We know that traversing the immense map of Kairos is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a vehicle, as well as fast travel points. And if you're already enjoying the endgame of Borderlands 4, don’t forget to check the weekly reset time for all current challenges.
