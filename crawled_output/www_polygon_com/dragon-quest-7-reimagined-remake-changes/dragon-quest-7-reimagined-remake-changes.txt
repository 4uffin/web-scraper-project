Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, next year's remake of PlayStation game Dragon Quest 7: Fragments of the Forgotten Past, will feature major upgrades and improvements on the original, Square Enix detailed in an update on Thursday. In addition to the "hand-crafted aesthetic" that renders the heroes and villains of DQ7 in miniature toylike form, expect big changes to gameplay and a streamlined story. It's the battle changes that will probably make longtime Dragon Quest fans the most excited. Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined will let players battle (weaker) monsters in the overworld, without having to enter unnecessary turn-based battles. Battles have been streamlined further, letting the player speed up combat through preset commands and even use auto-battle to let the game's AI take over. Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined's heroes will also have jobs... er, vocations that offer specific abilities, stats, and spells — but heroes can also "moonlight," taking on a second job. (Saving the world requires a grindset mentality, folks.) Each vocation has a unique perk that heroes can "let loose" after the character is "worked up," as Square Enix describes it.
Reimagined also has a new vocation, Monster Master, which lets heroes of that ilk summon monsters in battle.
Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined will be released on Feb. 5, 2026 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.

It sounds like they've made it a bit more like DQ11 with the battles, if I'm reading this right? I do think that was a good change for the franchise. I've never had the chance to play DQ7, either the Playstation or DS version, so I probably won't know the full extent of the changes, but I hope it's a fun game!
