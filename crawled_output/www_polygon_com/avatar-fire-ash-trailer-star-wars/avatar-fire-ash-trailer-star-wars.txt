A new trailer for Avatar: Fire and Ash, due out in December, is packed with surprises in a way I wasn’t expecting. Why did I think James Cameron might phone in the third installment of the passion project he’s spent the better part of 25 years developing? I am a fool who is hooked on Avatar. As I learned watching the action-heavy, two-and-a-half-minute sizzle reel, I am very invested in what happens to human-turned-Na’vi Jake Sully, his wife Neytiri, and their brood of noble kids as they traverse the various biomes of the extrasolar moon of Pandora. A glimpse at Varang, the leader of the Ash People, teaming up with undead Avatar Quaritch sent chills down my spine. I gasped when I saw Spider, the dreadlocked son of Quaritch embraced by Jake as one of his own, laying in the tendrils of Eywa, apparently getting his own neural kuru, and later connecting it to an Ilu. Oh yeah, that’s the stuff, baby. We love an Ilu ride courtesy of a human’s first kuru. Cameron is truly in his own lane. Nothing feels as big and bright and weird as Avatar. No other franchise has the capacity to whip a viewer from a highly militarized mechsuit battle to a tulkan water ballet. From the looks of it, Sigourney Weaver’s bizarre 14-year-old psychic Na’vi Kiri will be traveling to the core of Pandora to communicate with Eywa or some other variation on that sci-fi nonsense. Varang, as played by Oona Chaplin, looks like a much-needed dose of fury to balance out the crunchy New Age mysticism. Fantastic. All in. Even the trailers for Avatar movies feel constructed in a way that feels alien to everything else on the market. The priorities are majesty and story, rather than wisecracks and money shots (maybe because the stakes are higher than ever, and everything Cameron puts on the board is a money shot). I remember the sensation of seeing a trailer like this… decades ago watching those Star Wars Special Edition trailers. Or the first Phantom Menace trailer. Or the trailers I allowed myself to watch from the sequel trilogy. When new Star Wars stories were so few or far between, the trailers were highlights of the years. Things have changed. This week we got a first look at The Mandalorian and Grogu that, well, looked like more of the TV show that I’ve been watching for five years. There’s an actual new original Star Wars movie in the works, and I hope that tickles me in the old-fashioned way, but considering the sheer amount of Star Wars I expect to encounter before that, I’ll take even one “ooh” moment. But with Avatar, it’s pure reduce-me-to-a-child-waiting-for-Christmas hype. Scarcity works. The complaints everyone had about Avatar’s down period and questionable legacy is exactly why it has prevailed any time Cameron finishes a damn movie. And to bring both fire AND ash to one picture? In this economy? I hate to admit it, but Avatar, easily mocked and convoluted in its mythology, is delivering exactly what Star Wars did during its peak. Let’s go! Avatar: Fire and Ash hits theaters on Dec. 19.

Ah, you must've been huffing highlighters or permanent markers again. Avatar is incredibly generic compared to Star Wars, which was absolutely Earth shattering upon release. That was almost 50 YEARS AGO! When Avatar reaches 50, it will still be a generic message buried behind CGI, and presented in a way that makes the viewer feel guilty. Whereas the original Star Wars trilogy is timeless, used real physical miniatures and robotronic puppets, and has an infinitely more vast universe and canon. (And yes, everything before Disney Wars is true canon, obviously.) Strange article.

I really liked the first movie, but the second one was just a rehash and a slog... Not really looking forward to the third one, but will probably go see it anyway.

I’m glad you enjoy it the Avatar movies. I personally find their stories painfully generic… but I will go see this in theaters because they justify the big screen experience.
