The end of Justin Tipping’s football horror movie Him gets gory, which is no surprise given the violence and rivalry leading up to it. Eight-time champion quarterback Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans, in a ferocious performance) reveals what’s really been under the surface of his mentorship of wounded up-and-coming young quarterback Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers), and Isaiah White’s predatory wife Elsie (Uncut Gems’ Julia Fox) has some messy reveals of her own. Polygon talked to Fox about that ending — including an alternate version she shot, the disaster that hit the set during shooting, and what she thinks comes next for Elsie. [Ed. note: End spoilers ahead for Him.]
While the early going of Him suggests Cameron’s career may be over after a mysterious assault that leaves him concussed and possibly hallucinating, Isaiah eventually explains that his people orchestrated the attack on Cameron, setting in motion a series of events that was always meant to end with the two men fighting to the death. Whoever wins is expected to sign a football contract that will make him rich, famous, and essentially the property of the cultish organization behind Isaiah — Elsie among them. Cam wins the fight, kills Isaiah, and emerges into a football arena, where everyone believes he'll immediately participate in a ceremony signing his life away to his new would-be owners. (Pointedly, they’re all old, white, privileged men, apart from Elsie and a cadre of literally faceless cheerleaders serving as a sort of honor guard.) Instead, Cam fights back, killing the cultists. Elsie attempts to take him out herself, but ends up stabbed and bleeding out. It’s a Grand Guignol ending — and Fox says it was a bit of a nightmare to shoot. “In my last shot — we only had one of those dresses that I had on,” she told Polygon. “It was a custom dress made by a designer in Paris. We really only had one shot to get that whole scene. So obviously the pressure was really on. I'd never done anything like that before. I had worn prosthetics, but not like this one. It was just really, really intense.”
Fox says the cast did shoot a slightly different version of the ending, where the blood-covered dress was the same, but there were different reactions to Cam’s victory. “The ending actually changed on us a few times,” she said. “We shot the ending one way, and then we shot an alternate. They were just going to see which one worked more. So that was always in limbo, and we knew that throughout filming. In the other ending, Isaiah still dies — Cam still comes out as the winner. But our reactions were different. In the first ending, my reaction was heartbreak: I’d just lost my husband. And then in the second ending it was more, I don't really care that much, actually. I'm more interested in upholding this system that we're all existing in. That was the main difference. Fox says the sequence was shot in a football field in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “All the stuff in Isaiah's house — in our house, I guess — was shot in the wings of the stadium. So it was these beautiful sets built in the stadium, and that's why our house has such a brutalist raw feel. It’s what the football stadium interiors looked like. They did such a great job — it was one of the most beautiful sets I've ever seen.” That said, the shoot came apart at one point because of the risks of shooting outdoors. “Being at the mercy of the elements — New Mexico can be very, very hot, and at the same time, bone-chillingly cold,” Fox said. “While we were trying to shoot the ending, there was this crazy sandstorm. All of a sudden, the sky just turned red, and you couldn't even see your hand in front of you. We had to just abort the whole thing. “There were tumbleweeds flying through the air like grenades. and driving home was just terrifying. You could not see anything — like a full 360, it was all just red from the dirt being kicked up. It felt like being on Mars. And filming out on that field, it was like 110 degrees. But it was worth it. It looked great.” As far as what a truly alternate ending might have looked like, where Cam accepted his contract and went on to replace Isaiah as the GOAT of his generation, Fox has an idea of where Elsie might have ended up: “I think she would've absolutely made a deal with Cam: ‘We'll uphold this façade together. We both now have this secret, and I'll help you keep up the illusion. I will make our lives seem aspirational, and you can go and do whatever you want, as long as it never leaks anywhere. We'll just make this look like a happy home.’ I think she would try to make that deal.” While she thinks it’s possible Elsie might have already “built enough of an empire that she no longer needs a counterpart,” she thinks it’s more likely that her character would continue with the cult, for the power they’ve given her, especially after her tragic secret backstory. “She's working for this organization where in a lot of ways, they look to her to be the handler, to make sure everyone's where they're supposed to be,” she said. “And she's really moving the chess pieces across the board. So I think that even if she didn't want to make that deal with Cam, I think they would push her to, because they just like that she works hard for them and upholds their rule.” Him is in theaters now.

Not even this alternative ending could have improved the film, it's just not very good. For one, Cam barely objects to any of the stuff happening around him, so we don't feel bad for what he's going through. And two, the editing and direction are really confusing. On top of that there's not enough demonic stuff popping up to justify the creepy imagery, the only actual outright demonic things we see is literally that guy getting dragged into a portal. That's it. If there'd been more, like having Isaiah actually turning full demon during his fight with Cam but still losing, then it would have worked a lot more. But we don't get that.
