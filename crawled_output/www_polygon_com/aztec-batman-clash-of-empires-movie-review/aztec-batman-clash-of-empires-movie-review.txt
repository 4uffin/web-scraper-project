The animated film fails to integrate Batman’s mythology into a divine war
Aztec Batman stretches the limits of the Dark Knight past his breaking point

Batman is one of popular culture’s most versatile characters, and that’s perhaps most obvious in Warner Bros. Animation’s recent success throwing the Dark Knight into various historical settings. Batman went back in time to feudal Japan in Batman Ninja, investigated Jack the Ripper in the Victorian era in Batman: Gotham by Gaslight, and encountered cosmic horrors in the 1920s in Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham. Harley Quinn and Rick and Morty director Juan Meza-Leon’s Aztec Batman: Clash of Empires follows that tradition with a story set in 16th century Mesoamerica. But Batman mythology proves an awkward fit for a story focused on the historical Spanish invasion of Tenochtitlán and stretches the limits of what seemed like a foolproof storytelling formula. Batman Ninja and its sequel Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League worked by being absolutely ridiculous mashups of comic book and anime tropes. The other period films emphasized Batman’s title as the world’s greatest detective. But Aztec Batman’s Bruce Wayne stand-in, Yohualli Coatl (Horacio Garcia Rojas), doesn’t feel much like Batman, even though he sometimes dresses like a bat. Aztec Batman goes through many of the story beats of Batman: Year One. The conquistador Hernan Cortes (Alvaro Morte) kills Yohualli’s father and the young man swears vengeance. He trains hard, dresses in a costume to hide his identity, experiences some early failures, meets Catwoman equivalent Jaguar Woman (Teresa Ruiz), and improves his suit and skills. But he never investigates anything or finds a way to strike fear in the heart of Cortes and his forces. He’s more of a classic hero, rallying the people of Tenochtitlán with daring feats. He feels a bit like Zorro (an inspiration for Batman’s creators) but lacks the original vigilante’s wit or panache.

The narrative disconnect starts early. Yohualli has prophetic visions from the bat god Tzinacan, whom his father reveres. Batman is typically portrayed as at least a little unhinged, driven by his obsession with vengeance to become a symbol of fear. Here, Yohualli’s assumption of the mantle of Batman represents him finally accepting his divine destiny to become the champion in a war between gods. This is very literally presented through the contrasting visions experienced by King Moctezuma’s blood sacrifice-obsessed high priest Yoka (Omar Chaparro), who urges the Aztec leader to accept the conquistadors as gods. The neon-colored divinities are visually striking but narratively distracting as they sap characters of agency without having clear motivations of their own besides moving the conflict forward. A lot of time is spent setting up Yoka and his particularly disturbing spin on the Joker’s origin story, but he mostly just serves the stereotypical role of a manipulative vizier pointing Moctezuma (Humberto Busto) in the wrong direction. DC’s other time-hopping Batman films are all self-contained, but Aztec Batman focuses on laying groundwork for a sequel and never really delivers a compelling narrative of its own. None of Aztec Batman’s characters have much personality or character development. Forest Ivy (Maya Zapata) looks gorgeous in her crown of maize when an injured Yohualli encounters her in a psychedelic sequence, but she just serves as a sort of generic forest spirit guiding the hero along his destined path. The historical conquistador Pedro de Alvarado (Jose C. Illanes Puentes) doesn’t do much as Cortes’ bloodthirsty lieutenant. Stylish character design and sultry voice acting from Ruiz at least helps Jaguar Woman feel more like her DC counterpart than anyone else in the cast. Cortes’ descent into madness as he begins to view his hand as guided by fate is a clever way of fusing the historical character to Two Face, but he just becomes a caricature of greed as he seeks to plunder Tenochtitlán.

If Meza-Leon wanted to make a story about a divine conflict in Mesoamerica featuring DC Comics characters, he would have been far better off centering it on Wonder Woman than Batman. There’s even precedent for a Latin American version of the character in Yara Flor. Wonder Woman would also make a lot more sense fighting in the center of a pitched battle than Batman, who is meant to do his work from the shadows. The battle sequences themselves mostly aim for shock value in the horror of Spanish slaughter. Mexico City-based animation studio Ánima manages to make the chase sequences featuring Yohualli and Jaguar Woman feel fluid, but the multiple fights between Yohualli and Cortes look stiff in comparison. Without strong action, the scenes are left to rely on cliche dialogue as Cortes gloats and Batman mostly just grunts. Batman is an extremely versatile character, and I still think a Mesoamerican version of him could work well, particularly if a creator went back to the comic book character’s pulp origins and effectively just told a Zorro story. I’d also happily watch another film by Mexican creatives focused on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. But jamming the ideas together leaves Aztec Batman feeling disjointed, a weak attempt to tell a dark story that the Dark Knight doesn’t fit into. Aztec Batman will be available on VOD platforms on Sept. 19.

"Quelled surprise!", as they say in France. After the aforementioned Batman ninja nonsense, and the Batman musical featuring Harley Quinn, I have stopped watching any animated Batman content. I don't know what the bigwigs at DC animation are smoking, but it ain't the good stuff.

Usually I'm hyped by Mexican inspired whatever, but using a pretty complex conflict like Mexico-Tenochtitlan's fall actually depresses me: most of the soldiers on Cortes's side were the heavily oppressed neighbors of the Mexica, they were so despised that their rivals, the Purepecha denied them any help. Since I'm living in a polarized Mexico were our history is grossly simplified to serve political agendas this worries me a lot... (por example, an ultra-conservative president that calls himself a leftist just because he culturally appropriates many prehispanic symbols, while eroding the separation between religion and state as a side effect of a Judicial reform that is pretty much in line with Trump's initiatives in the US)..Also, Aztec was their name before setting and founding Mexico-Tenocthitlan.

You're right that the conflict was pretty complex, and based on the trailers we've seen it doesn't seem like the movie is that focused on the political nuances, but as somebody who follows Mesoamerican history and archeology, your description of those nuances aren't accurate.The Mexica of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan were expansionistic conquerors, yes, but their style of rule after subjugating their targets was loose and hands off: They (and other large Mesoamerican powers, likely due to the lack of draft animals and difficult terrain making more direct control logistically costly) typically left existing kinds in power, laws in place, and didn't impose customs, usually having only basic obligations like taxes of economic goods (not usually supplying captives, who were mostly collected during wars, not after a state was already conquered), to not to block roads, etc.This meant subjects and vassals were, in practice and even to an extent in formality, still independent
states, and in turn kept their own political ambitions and agency. That in turn enabled opportunistic defection or secession (for states which were not invested and wanted to get out of paying taxes; keep in mind though some states WILLINGLY joined the Aztec Empire or other political networks to gain power/influence, better trade access, protection etc); or arrangements where a state pledged themselves as a subject or ally to another (since, again, you didn't lose much by doing so), to help them take out their collective rivals or capitals, to then have higher status within that new kingdom they helped prop up.THAT is pretty much what happened with Cortes and how he got allies: Cortes was being used by local states and their kings in the same manner opportunistic power-plays had always been doing in the region. I seem to have hit the character limit so I will continue my explanation in another reply.

(This is a continuation of my other reply)The Mexica/Tenochtitlan got help overthrowing their old capital and rose to power this same way a century before Cortes. And decades after Cortes, various Zapotec, Maya etc states allied with other Conquistadors to take out their rivals too. This was just a common thing, not a unique reaction to Mexica rule in particular.Now, Tlaxcala specifically, which is the state allied with Cortes most people focus on the most, likely did resent the Mexica specifically... because they were at war at the time, with Tenochtitlan trying to conquer Tlaxcala, and even subjecting it to an unusual amount of special Flower Wars. Tlaxcala was NOT a subject already inside the empire. By contrast, Texcoco, Chalco, Xochimilco etc WERE inside it, and (to varying degrees) BENEFITTED from Mexica rule, due their political marriages with Mexica royalty and the taxes Mexica conquests brought into the valley. Texcoco in particular was even a secondary capital. Which is why they, unlike Tlaxcala, only allied with the Conquistadors and Tlaxcala AFTER Tenochtitlan was ravaged by smallpox, multiple Mexica kings/nobles died etc. By then, those states had less to lose and more to gain by switching sides. Even then, most Mexica subjects didn't defect; and of those that did, some only did so after being beaten and forced to, or only specific officials/factions within them switched sides (EX: Ixtlilxochitl II of Texcoco and his followers defected, not his brother/the king Coanacochtzin; while Xochimilco only allied with the Conquistadors, Tlaxcalteca, and Ixtlilxochitl II's faction after being beaten by them)Even Tlaxcala used Cortes to attack other cities to further their own political reach, not just to strike back at the Mexica: Everybody was using and manipulating each other. So yes, it was a complex conflict, but "The Mexica were oppressive and resented and that's why Cortes got allies" isn't accurate.
