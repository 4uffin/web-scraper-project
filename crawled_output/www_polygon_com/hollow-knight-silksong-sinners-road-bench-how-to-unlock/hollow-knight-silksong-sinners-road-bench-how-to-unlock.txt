The Sinner's Road bench in Hollow Knight: Silksong will make you feel like you got scammed out of 60 rosaries as you cannot actually rest on it — at least not immediately. After your long trek through Greymoor to reach Sinner's Road, you're probably dying to find a bench to keep you away from those roach-like hounds that will tear you apart. Luckily, you find one, but only find out that it won't fully rise out of the ground as it seems to be locked in place. However, fear not, as the way to unlock the bench can be found in the very same room. Here's how to unlock the Sinner's Road bench in Hollow Knight: Silksong. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

The Sinner's Road bench can be found on the left side of the first vertical chamber. You'll notice a lot of signs pointing to it as soon as you enter, but you won't be able to reach it immediately. Wall jump upwards off of the hanging cages and exit through the doorway on your right.

Continue all the way to the right to find a bug inside a broken cage. Use the right side of the cage to propel yourself upwards and platform to the top left section of this area to find a door leading back to the room you came from.

Inside this room, you'll find cages below you that'll lead you directly to the bench, but before you do that, you should activate a switch that'll make your trip to the bench much shorter. Jump up onto the cage above you and onto the platform to your left. Dash into the gap ahead and drop down to find a switch that will lower a cage. Return to the platform outside of the spiked entrance and drop down onto the cages below you until you find the room with the bench.

Once inside, pogo across the swinging metal ball and pay 60 rosaries to activate the bench. However, you'll find that the bench is actually broken and won't completely rise out of the ground. To fix it, climb up the wall to the left of the bench and destroy the wall near the ceiling to reveal a hidden area.

For the first portion of this room, you'll need to pogo your way over swinging metal balls until you reach the left wall, where you'll need to glide your way over spikes and even more metal swinging balls. If you're having a hard time making your way through the gliding portion, we recommend gliding over the whole and then quickly dropping down once the swinging metal ball moves out of the way. However, make sure to quickly glide again after you make it through the hole because, of course, there are more spikes and metal balls waiting for you.

After you make it to the bottom, you'll need to pogo over, you guessed it, more swinging balls until you reach an area covered in roots. Destroy the roots to unlock the hidden gears, which will free the bench. Wall jump up the wall to the left and make your way back to the bench, where you are now free to rest. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
