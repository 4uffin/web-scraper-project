It's been a couple of months since HBO aired The Last of Us season 2's finale, but discontent around the adaptation is still going strong, it seems. Earlier this month, Bella Ramsey, the actor behind Ellie, went on EW's The Awardist podcast where they chatted about the tumultuous reception to the season. It was a level-headed discussion, but Ramsey didn't mince words. As spotted by GamesRadar, Ramsey notes that while they're aware that people are unhappy with season 2, they try to "steer clear" of the negativity as much as they can. "The show is out," Ramsey says. "There’s nothing that can be changed or altered. So I’m like, there’s not really any point in reading or looking at anything." As the star of seasons 1 and 2 of the HBO's The Last of Us, Ramsey probably had some influence over the adaptation. We know, for example, that some aspects of the show in both seasons have been improvised or changed on the fly. At the same time, they're an actor and much of the criticism lobbed at the show targeted the writing, tone, and direction of the production. Speaking broadly, there was concern among the fandom that showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann didn't fully understand the source material, and that the show was turning Ellie from a seasoned killer into an immature child. Those are elements that Ramsey is not responsible for, and is instead primarily tasked with carrying out the vision laid out by its writers and showrunners. Ramsey's right to feel like they can't do much about the things people dislike about the show. "I just don’t really engage," Ramsey says. Asked whether Ramsey has a message for critics who dislike season 2, they argued, "I would say, you don't have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don’t have to watch it, but if you do want to watch it, then I hope you enjoy it." It's a sensible answer, but that doesn't mean it's being received well by fans. "YES, we could play the game again, but a lot of us didn’t like the game either," reads one comment on the podcast. One thing's for sure: Season 3 of The Last of Us will be quite different. Though Ramsey will likely feature in season 3 of The Last of Us, we know that this portion of the show will focus more on Abby than Ellie. Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has left the show, and it'll be curious to see where HBO takes the adaptation without one of its key figures. While Druckmann has directed excellent episodes, like episode 6 of season 2, in which Ellie and Joel explore a science museum, he's also directed questionable episodes — including the season 1 ep where Tess dies while kissing an infected.
At the same time, a number of groan-worthy changes from the games seemed to stem from Mazin, based on remarks from the showrunnet. He's the one who considered it unrealistic for Ellie to take on both Owen and Mel. He also contrasted Ellie and Abby by noting that, unlike Ellie, Abby is competent. That infamous "I'm gonna be a dad" line from season 2 apparently popped into Mazin's head while shooting. When describing the creative process, it seems that Mazin was generally the one who questioned why things in the game played out the way they did and whether the show had to follow suit. Being willing to poke at the story isn't inherently a bad thing, but it's evident that the instinct did not always yield positive results. Whatever the case, hopefully HBO gets it right. Season 3 will be longer than season 2, so it's going to be painful if the show keeps missing the mark. At least there's arguably a good reason to go back to the games right now: Over the summer, The Last of Us Part 2 got an update that lets you experience its gut-wrenching story in chronological order.

I personally quite disliked some of the decisions made on the TLOU TV show, mostly to do with Ellie's characterisation and the general tone of Season 2 in particular. But the abuse Ramsey gets online is nothing short of horrendous. People take this stuff far too seriously. Good on them for powering through the noise.

I've never played the game and neither has my sister and we agreed it was a poor decision to make the season the way they did. Incredibly short and then leave off where the next season will focus on a character we've basically seen for 10 minutes in the whole series. They should have done more of Abby this season. I personally have no qualms with the changes to characters but it was not a well made or planned out season

It’s an adaptation, not a remake. I wish more fans would get this. For what it’s worth I enjoyed S2 immensely but then I haven’t played the games.

People didn't like the game either cuz they caved Joel's skull in within the first fifteen minutes, expected us to shake our finger at Ellie for pursuing revenge, then expected us to feel bad for Abby hours later into the game...even though we'd spent years growing to love Joel. You can't make us feel for a character who just murdered a beloved protagonist in the first fifteen minutes of the sequel. Not unless maybe we immediately jump to playing as her, and we don't. And you can't make the argument of "revenge is bad" when you don't genuinely criticize Abby taking revenge the way you do for Ellie. It especially doesn't work when Joel and Tommy had just saved Abby's life from an infected horde only a few minutes earlier in the game, so it makes it even less excusable because Abby owes him and Tommy her life. So it comes off as even more unjustified.

Never played the game. The whole point of a tv show/movie adaptation is to see the content in a new format... Not see different content in a new format - that's just a different IP, at that point. But even if we ignore deviation from source material and the plea by cast to 'just replay the game' if we that version of the story... well, if you are making a show based on a game, who is it for? People who aren't fans of the game? People who only like tv shows? People who only watch adaptations and never play the source material? That's how you're making it sound... as if the show isn't meant for game fans somehow. As someone who isn't a fan of the game, I was on board with the show until season 2. Started off with the death of the main char, which I guess is accurate, but the rest seemed very poorly written. When I ask how far the show deviates in season 2... almost entirely different from how the game has it. Some events and characters are invented for the show, and it feels sorta like that... even though I have never played the game. If you want an adaptation to be relevant to the fans of the source material, you have to stick to the source material. You don't get to take creative liberties and then tell people to get bent when they don't like it.

It's all silly. It's silly that a game was made that cares more about being a tv show than a game. It's silly that a tv show adapted that game. It's silly that people wanted that show to emulate the game perfectly (what's the point?). It's silly that other people hated the game and so were thrilled to hate the game as well.It's all entertainment. It's all optional. Nothing's overwriting anything else and none of it's worth orthodoxic righteousness. Chill the f out. Prove that you're an adult who has an ounce of perspective on life.

one of the biggest letdowns in turns of casting for Joel and Ellie. oh, what could have been? Cast some actors and actresses that actually remind you of the source material and make it differ from there in terms of story to deviate from the game. Horrible, woke as hell and just a bad casting director who wouldn't take other opinions into account.

Woke? Tell me more about what you mean - or are you simply complaining that a non-binary actor was cast?
