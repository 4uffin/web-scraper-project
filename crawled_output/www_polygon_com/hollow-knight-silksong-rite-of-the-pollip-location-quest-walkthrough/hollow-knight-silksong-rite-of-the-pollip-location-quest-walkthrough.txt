"Rite of the Pollip" is a quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong where you need to find six Pollip Hearts scattered around Shellwood. Pollip Hearts are collected by breaking purple flowers. Finding all six is a challenge on its own, but actually collecting them all adds another layer of difficulty. You'll need to put your pogo and parkour skills to the test as you'll bounce from flower to flower, and to make matters worse, you cannot obtain them all until you grab a crucial movement ability hidden in Shellwood. Here's how to complete the "Rite of the Pollip" quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong and where to find all six Pollip Hearts. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

The "Rite of the Pollip" quest can be started by talking to Greyroot in Shellwood, which is directly west of Bellhart. Greyroot is found inside a cave near the center of Shellwood and southwest of Shellwood's rightmost bench.

Prior to starting your search, we recommend grabbing the Cling Grip ability first as you'll need it to grab some of the Pollip Hearts, and it will make your search a tad easier. Cling Grip allows you to slide down walls and jump off of them, which means you can climb up any flat vertical surface. To get it, you'll need to go to the northwestern area of Shellwood and do a lot of pogoing.

After you unlocked Cling Grip, you're free to grab all six Pollip Hearts, which we've labeled on the map above for your convenience.
Pollip Heart #1 location

The first Pollip Heart can be found shortly after you unlock the Cling Grip ability. Make your way to the very top of Shellwood by utilizing Cling Grip and wall jumping your way to the peak. Here, you'll find a purple nest that releases Wood Wasps, which are small purple bugs that launch themselves at you. To get past the nest, you'll need to hit it repeatedly until it breaks. Head inside and drop down to find yourself in a secret area that contains a hidden Pollip flower and along with a thorny ceiling. To easily avoid hitting the ceiling, we recommend dashing across the gap rather than jumping. Collect the Pollip Heart by hitting the purple flower, and head to the left to make your way to the second Pollip Heart.
Pollip Heart #2 location

From the Cling Grip ability location, slowly make your way down the left side while landing on the ledges below. However, there are floral enemies looming about, so use Swift Step and Drifter's Cloak to avoid them as necessary. As you're making your way down, you'll notice small purple flowers along the left wall. The Pollip flower is found inside a small alcove directly below the purple flowers, so make sure to either glide or dash into the opening to reach the Pollip Heart. If you do miss the landing, head to the right wall and wall climb your way to the black metallic platform. Defeat the floral enemy on the wall and drop down to the platform below. Walk over to the left edge and try again.
Pollip Heart #3 location

From the bottom floor of the chamber with the Cling Grip ability, make your way to the right most wall and wall climb your way up to the first entrance on your right. In this hallway, you'll find vines with white flowers hanging from the ceiling. The third purple flower is found at the top of this chamber, so you'll need to pogo your way to the ceiling to collect this Pollip Heart.
Pollip Heart #4 location
For the fourth Pollip Heart, you'll need to progress to the area above Bellhart, just before the Widow boss fight. If you've already defeated Widow, you might've unlocked the hidden pathway that leads directly back to the bench in Shellwood. If not, we recommend following our "The Threadspun Town" quest walkthrough as this Pollip Heart can be found near the end of this quest, and you'll be killing two birds with one stone.

From the bench in the Shellwood, wall climb your way up to the entrance that you uncovered that leads to the area above Bellhart. However, don't head too far into the hallway as this Pollip Heart can be found near the entrance. Drop down just before the thorny floor, and break the vines along the left wall. Inside, you'll find the fourth Pollip Heart.
Pollip Heart #5 location
From the rightmost bench in Shellwood, drop off of the right side and head through the entrance on your right. Progress to the right side, but keep an eye out for the purple flowers along the ceiling. After you spot them, you'll need to proceed ahead until you find a climbable wall, which can be seen in the first gallery image above. Make your way up to find the fifth Pollip Heart.
Pollip Heart #6 location

From the Shellwood bench, drop off the left edge and head into the entrance on your left. Take the elevator down and head to the left side of the room. Platform your way to the right wall where you'll see purple flowers lining the walls. From here, jump to the top and collect the Pollip Heart on the ceiling.

After you've collected all six Pollip Hearts, make your way back to Greyroot to complete the "Rite of the Pollip" quest and make sure to exhaust their dialogue to receive the Pollip Pouch tool. When equipped, the Pollip Pouch will apply venom to all of your tools, which will deal a couple ticks of damage to any enemy hit by one of your red tools. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
