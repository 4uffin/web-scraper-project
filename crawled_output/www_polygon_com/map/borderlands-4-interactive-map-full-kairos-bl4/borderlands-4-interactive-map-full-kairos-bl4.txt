The Borderlands 4 map is a first for Borderlands: a truly open world, rather than a series of interconnected open-ish areas. Borderlands 4 is set on Kairos, a planet ruled by the Timekeeper and full of stuff. Like, a scary amount of stuff. What that means for the looter-shooter (and for you, the player) is that there are a lot of collectibles for you to find and regions to explore. Respec machines and banks are few and far between, but you can find them at fast travel locations around the map. We also show you where to find mines, bunkers, and vaults, so you can take on every boss across Kairos. You can find where to start side quests like "Vend of the Line," so you can grab more Eridium to respec your Specialization tree. And if you're looking to get more SDU tokens, we've got you covered with icons for Dead Bolts, Electi Safes, and Evocarium. Our Borderlands 4 interactive map — which, bear in mind, is an ongoing work in progress as we strive to complete the game — will help you find that stuff. Our most recent update, published Sept. 19, has added descriptions for coordinates and details for Echo Logs. Below, see our full Borderlands 4 interactive map of Kairos. [Ed. note: Spoilers follow for Borderlands 4. If you'd like to discover the game at your own pace, bookmark this page and come back later.]
