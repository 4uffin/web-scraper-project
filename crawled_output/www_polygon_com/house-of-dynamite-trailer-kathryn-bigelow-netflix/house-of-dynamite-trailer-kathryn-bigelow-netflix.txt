Just a warning: The trailer for A House of Dynamite might be a terrible way to start a Wednesday. The logline from Netflix tells you enough: "When a single, unattributed missile is launched at the United States, a race begins to determine who is responsible and how to respond." Not chill. Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow lives without fear. While her resume is littered with Quality Genre Movies (see: Near Dark, Point Break, and Strange Days) she has spent the last decade and a half grappling with the heaviest issues facing the nation. The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty took a scalpel to America's neverending conflict in the Middle East, while 2017's underseen Detroit confronted racism and American police force through the lens of the 12th Street Riot. Based on the sound of it, A House of Dynamite, which arrives in October, might see her two lanes converge — it's a classic ticking-clock thriller with apocalyptic stakes that, sadly, feels all too real.
For her first film in eight years, Bigelow has assembled a cast worthy of her Oscar cred. Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Gabriel Basso, Jared Harris, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos, Moses Ingram, Jonah Hauer-King, Greta Lee, and Jason Clarke all star in what looks like a suffocating bad-good time at the movies. And by all accounts, she knocked it out of the park: A House of Dynamite premiered at the Venice Film Festival to glowing reviews. Descriptions like "precision-tooled" and "razor-sharp" are music to this fan's ears. Very few of us will see A House of Dynamite in theaters, but there is a chance: Bigelow's next will open in select theaters on Oct. 3 in the U.K., then select theaters globally Oct. 10. The movie arrives on Netflix on Oct. 24. Maybe if there's enough Oscar buzz, the streamer will release a theatrical sing-a-long version too?

Sweet. Let’s start debating about a movie that’s not out and nobody can say for sure what actions are or aren’t taken. That said.
Hypothetically speaking, I’d definitely angree immediate action would be inhumane. But, when you consider our wonderful leaders knew about the Pearl Harbor attack WAY before it hit and did nothing - and that was a long time and a lot of tech advances ago- I can’t imagine it would take more than a few seconds to trace the trajectory, flip some keys, and do what we do

This is a masterfully tight thought provoking film that represents some experiences America has to face in the past making tough decisions about confronting an enemy. This film will do well providing
one of the tightest of dramas available.

Neocons corrupt both sides. Not sure why you think dems are soft. Unless it's Bernie Sanders they're pretty much all bought by lobbies.

I read a lengthy article on the movie. It's a liberal produced movie, so it's going to be exploring the option of non retaliation by the US government, which is exactly the type of non response that you could expect from a Democrat in office. Hard pass. Not going to waste my time on a movie where our government doesn't fight back because they're afraid of hurting someone's feelings.

I'd suggest that non-retaliation to an overwhelming surprise nuclear attack is an incredibly brave and humane decision. Why sentence hundreds of millions, if not billions, worldwide to die just because you're own country is being wiped off the map? What does it achieve?I'd suggest you read the award winning best-seller 'Nuclear War: A Scenario' but you've probably got quite a closed mind from the sound of things.

Non retaliation seems like a pretty salient topic when they don't know who fired the missile? C'mon, dude.

You're right. The Republican would automatically escalate and fire nukes at everyone. Pretty sad if that is what interests you more.
