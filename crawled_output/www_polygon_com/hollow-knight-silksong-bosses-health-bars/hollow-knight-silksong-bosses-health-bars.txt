Let's up the stakes for these boss fights

When Eminem raps, “His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy,” in the opening of “Lose Yourself,” he’s describing what his semi-autobiographical character in 8 Mile is feeling during a rap battle. Though, really, he’s describing me during a tough boss fight in Hollow Knight: Silksong (minus the “vomit on his sweater already” part). Boss fights are often the most tension-filled moments in action games, and there are plenty of them in Silksong. They range from tough one-on-one duels to somewhat gimmicky fights where the floor is literally lava. Something they all share? Difficulty — Silksong’s boss fights are tough as shit, y’all. But that toughness doesn’t translate to excitement for me as much as it does in other games with challenging boss fights due in part to the lack of enemy health bars.
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
I can quickly learn how many whacks with Hornet’s needle are needed to take down a regular foe while exploring Silksong’s winding levels. For boss fights, however, the enemy health pools are so large that I can spend minutes whacking away with seemingly little indication of how much damage I’ve dealt. Some bosses have phases that indicate how much progress I’ve made in a fight, but that doesn’t have the same effect as a red health bar at the bottom of the screen tracking how much (or how little) progress I’ve made toward vanquishing a foe. The original Hollow Knight didn’t have health bars either, so it’s obvious there’s intent behind developer Team Cherry’s decision not to include them. Just like how there’s surely intent behind design decisions like long walkbacks to bosses and losing all of Hornet’s rosary beads upon death. Those designs are clearly trying to elicit a specific experience for the player. But I’d argue that adding health indicators for bosses would actually benefit Team Cherry’s intended player experience. Silksong is a tough game, though it often doesn’t balance the fun with its tedious frustrations (case in point: those damn corpse runs). Tracking progress in a boss fight could flip them from being frustrating toward being fun, as there’s nothing quite as perversely enjoyable as the white-knuckled, sweaty-palmed feeling of getting this close against a tough boss — and dying.

This is something boss fights in Soulslikes excel at. I can’t tell you how many times my heart rate has spiked in Elden Ring or Lies of P as a dwindling health bar amps up the pressure — and the nerves — as I close in on victory. I often get more aggressive at the end of fights in an attempt to win quickly, which is either a great strategy or a foolish endeavor, depending on if I come out victorious. In Silksong, boss fights instead end with something of a whimper. I don’t find myself aggressively rushing toward a climatic conclusion. Instead, when I beat a boss, I’m left with a feeling of, “Oh! Guess I won.” It doesn’t hit the same. Hollow Knight: Silksong doesn’t even need strict red, rectangular health bars to elicit that same rush of adrenaline as a fight nears its finish. A game like Death’s Door, Acid Nerve’s 2021 action-adventure game, understood this, swapping classic health bars for a system where purple cracks appeared on enemies the more damage they took. Fighting through Death’s Door as a crow with a big sword, I never knew quite how close I was to finishing a boss or regular enemy off, yet seeing my foe crack further and further still gave me that “oh shit it’s almost dead” feeling.
Image: Acid Nerve/Devolver Digital
A similar system would work well in Silksong. It wouldn’t affect the perceived difficulty at all — I love a good challenge! — but would rather enhance those difficult encounters. I want my palms to be sweatier, knees weaker, and arms heavier when going up against Silksong’s Last Judge. Silksong is intended to be an intense, adrenaline-pumping experience, so why not dial that intensity all the way up? Of course, Team Cherry spent years developing this game, and going by how its second patch ignores the conversation surrounding Silksong’s difficulty (and instead focuses on bug fixes), it seems pretty clear the developers made the game they intended to. I’m not expecting any major overhauls in the coming months or years to change that. Though, I think adding a health indicator would be a minor change that’d go a long way in enhancing an already great game.

I used a mod to show the health bar and it didn't make the game any easier.

Health bar mod doesn't make it easier, but knowing you got the boss down to 500 health attempt 2, 400 health on attempt 6, 200 health on attempt 10, and 50 health on attempt 12 makes you excited to try attempt 13 because you know you're making progress. Without it, all you know is you tried 12 times and you lost. That's demotivating af.

So uh...Does anyone have any thoughts about the game NOT about the difficulty? Anyone wanna talk about how all the characters will sing a little song when you play the Needolin near them, adding some hidden texture and pathos to the world that could be easily missed? No? Just the difficulty, got it!

It's almost like the overturned difficulty is making it hard for people to access and enjoy the rest of the game.I fixed it with mods and very much enjoy the music, the art, the characters, the environments, and the lore. But without mods, I'd be stuck halfway through act one and the game would be uninstalled.

Yes exactly this! It’s hard to keep going back for another beating if you don’t even know if you were getting close. A boss health bar is just more information to help decide how to progress through the game

Have no health bar being shown is great because you will push yoyrself harder and harder so that you can win. There is also a boss that relies on not having its health shown which nakes it a much harder boss fight, specifcally the boss fight at cogwork entrance

No. No health bar makes you give up because you don't feel like you're making any progress.

a_moliski That is a you problem. You can beat every boss when you encounter them. Monster hunter is great and also doesn't have health bars.

Gege It's a team cherry problem. I don't like Monster Hunter either for the same reason, and I'm not the only person with disposable income who thinks so.

I disagree. I think the fights are about zen. Like finding yourself winning and you were like wait what, i had zoned out and was purely focusing on staying alive! or whatever task at hand. The run back is just from souls games and its often not THAT bad but in some instances can be alot. But honestly that time between is like a reset point. A reflecting moment upon your actions and sometimes makes you put down the game and take a break too.

Almost every boss has a near-death phase: they get more furious, attacks get more complex, even the music speeds up. That is Team Cherry's rendition of a health bar, and I think it works perfectly to execute exactly the effect you're describing, within the bounds of their own vision.

I don't think it's about making the game easier. It's about gauging how close or far away from victory you are. It's about realizing whether this is a boss you can fight with your current hp and weapon damage or whether you should just screw off and get more power-ups before fighting it. I need that.

And that is irrelevant(and subjective) because the game is masterpiece that is the longer you play it the better it gets. I am currently 50hrs in and the game is surprised me again and again with how much attention to the details devs put in it. One of the best metroidvanias in years(its hard even to compare it other mvs, pop maybe but i still think silksong is better)

Or just pay attention. There are so many obvious signs to the health state of the boss it be obvious how close you are to beating it.

Missing health bars are part of the charm. Monster hunter is also better without them. Calling everything you dislike "bad design decisions" is petty. Luckily the devs don't listen to you. Plenty of games out there that you can play instead

Boss fights in silksong is so short(couple minutes) that it doesn't really need any health bars at all. You can easily understand how much health boss has left by phase changes.
