In Paizo’s science fantasy tabletop role-playing game Starfinder, parties of quirky adventurers band together to face threats to the Pact Worlds. The CRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, which is expected to launch in early access in 2026, is emulating that feeling with its misfit crew of companions. Developers Epictellers Entertainment gave Polygon the chance to exclusively reveal two of the characters you can command in battle and romance between missions. The android Lu-323 (Melissa Medina of Borderlands 4 and Warframe 1999) was an elite stealth operative before she was captured by a robotics corporation on the planet Akiton. Since then, she’s developed a personality based on watching lots of telenovelas and TV dramas.

The Epictellers Entertainment team says Lu-323 was originally inspired by Blade Runner but they’re aware of how closely her story mirrors Martha Wells’ The Murderbot Diaries and the AppleTV Plus Murderbot show. As an Envoy, Lu-323 will be less focused on neutralizing threats herself, instead using her leadership skills to bolster allies. Sterling (James Alexander of Dragon’s Dogma 2) was once human, but after a painful death he rose again as a Borai, a type of undead created when a fragment of a person’s soul clings to their corpse. Borai are particularly common on the planet Eox, which will be at the heart of Starfinder: Afterlight’s plot. Sterling’s class is Solarian, meaning he draws on cosmic forces to conjure a blade made from solar energy.

Personality wise, Sterling is a trickster in the vein of Loki, though the character also draws on British secret agent archetypes embodied by Pierce Brosnan’s James Bond and the Kingsman films. He’ll be looking to recover his memories and try to solve the mystery of his own death. Lu-323 and Sterling join the grumpy Ysoki Operative Tycho and the Vesk Soldier Kole, who Epictellers Entertainment based on ‘80s action heroes. Epictellers will be launching a Kickster campaign for Starfinder: Afterlight in October to raise funds to add more voice acting and expand the list of player character options.
