An infected in Columbia Pictures' 28 YEARS LATER.
28 Years Later, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, is finally coming to streaming on Netflix on Sept. 20. 28 Years Later follows up the films 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, showing how humanity has progressed since the rage virus took over the British Isles, turning citizens feral with infectious blood. Now that civilization has completely collapsed, this post-apocalyptic landscape sees people revert to villages and live on islands, where initiations for the young boys consist of venturing off into the mainland to prove their mettle by killing infected people. It's a surreal coming-of-age film with a twisted edge that expounds humanity's need for war and to create bizarre rites of passage. Boyle isn't done with the franchise, as 28 Years Later is the first part of a new trilogy that is expected to continue in theaters on Jan. 16, 2026, with 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple. Nia DaCosta (2021's Candyman) will direct this film, with Boyle expected to return for the follow-up film in the future. Meanwhile, Garland's next film is slated to be a live-action adaptation of FromSoftware's Elden Ring game for A24.
28 Years Later will debut on Netflix in the US on Sept. 20.

The claim "The best horror movie sequel of 2025" is misleading because it suggests that 28 Years Later is a good film.It's not.
