Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is one of the weekly challenges you can pursue in Borderlands 4 after you have completed the campaign. Also known as the legendary vending machine, this unique service appears once a week with a select inventory of legendary guns and ordnance for you to buy — but only if you can find it! The Black Market Vending Machine’s location changes after Borderlands 4’s weekly reset, and its icon only appears on the map when you get near it. To help you locate this special vending machine and grab some legendary gear before the reset, we’ve prepared this guide showing where to find Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine in Borderlands 4 and how it works. If you need more help finding the area, check out our full interactive Borderlands 4 map.

The quickest way to reach where the machine is located is by fast traveling to the Rustical Hurl Silo and head north. Follow the path upward until you find a house with a giant sphere on top of it. Enter the building to find Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine.

Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine explained
Unlike other vending machines, Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is a special one that only sells legendary items. You can buy as many items from it as you want to — if you have the money, since these items are quite expensive. If you have more than one character, you can buy from the machine with all of them. You can even buy more of the same item. When you use Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine with one character, your other Vault Hunters won’t be locked out of it, and the same items will be offered to them.

The Black Market Vending Machine always gets on cooldown after you leave its menu, whether you buy something or not. The cooldown is around 30 minutes. After this time, you can go back and buy another item.
