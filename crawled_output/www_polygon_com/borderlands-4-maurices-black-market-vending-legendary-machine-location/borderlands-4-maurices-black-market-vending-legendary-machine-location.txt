Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is one of the weekly challenges you can pursue in Borderlands 4 after you have completed the campaign. Also known as the legendary vending machine, this unique service appears once a week with a select inventory of legendary guns and ordnance for you to buy — but only if you can find it! The Black Market Vending Machine’s location changes after Borderlands 4’s weekly reset, and its icon only appears on the map when you get near it. To help you locate this special vending machine and grab some legendary gear before the reset, we’ve prepared this guide showing where to find Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine in Borderlands 4 and how it works. If you need more help finding the area, check out our full interactive Borderlands 4 map.
Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine location in Borderlands 4
For the week of Sept. 18-25, you can find the Black Market Vending machine in the Punitive Manufactorium in the Cuspid Climb area.

The entrance to this case is behind a waterfall on the Cuspic Climb’s northeast side. Once you’re inside, turn left and keep going forward until you find an Order base. Head southeast and use the platforms and pipe to reach the upper level of the base.

Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine explained
Unlike other vending machines, Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine is a special one that only sells legendary items. You can buy as many items from it as you want to — if you have the money, since these items are quite expensive. If you have more than one character, you can buy from the machine with all of them. You can even buy more of the same item. When you use Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine with one character, your other Vault Hunters won’t be locked out of it, and the same items will be offered to them.

The Black Market Vending Machine always gets on cooldown after you leave its menu, whether you buy something or not. The cooldown is around 30 minutes. After this time, you can go back and buy another item.
