As a master of popcorn movies and a one-of-a-kind eye whose macabre style is so recognizable his last name is basically an adjective, one would think Tim Burton would own a spot in the Criterion Collection, but alas, no. Neither the critically acclaimed dramas (Ed Wood, Big Fish) nor his weirdo comedies (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice) have earned him a spot in the film world’s most elite home video line. That is, until now. On Monday, Criterion announced that a Burton film would finally earn a spine in the collection — #1293 to be exact. And not only is it his first movie to make it, it’s his first movie to make it. Burton’s directorial feature debut, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, will join the collection on Dec. 16.

Pee-wee’s Big Adventure was the brainchild of the late Paul Reubens, who leveraged a tour of his character Pee-Wee Herman into a feature film deal with Warner Bros. Pictures. (Such things were possible in the 1980s!) After actor Shelley Duvall introduced Reubens to Burton at a party, and together watched his film Frankenweenie, the actor insisted to WB that the young animator direct his live-action movie. Burton got the job, collaborated with Reubens on making Big Adventure the weirdo odyssey it is today — including roping in Oingo Boingo’s Danny Elfman to do the score — and the rest is history. For its Criterion release, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure has been given a 4K digital restoration overseen by Burton himself, with both 2.0 surround and 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtracks included. The UHD package comes with a Dolby Vision HDR disc as well as a Blu-ray housing the movie and its supplements. Extras lean heavily into the film’s creative history, with two audio commentaries (one with Burton and Paul Reubens, another with Danny Elfman over a music-only track), and a slate of new interviews. There are also deleted scenes, the original trailer, and footage from a 40th anniversary screening hosted by comedian Dana Gould. In recent years, the Criterion Collection has expanded its purview beyond arthouse fare and European cinema (although it’s still pretty much No. 1 for those sectors, too). A time when Wall-E and House Party have entered the collection was bound to provide Burton’s in, and it sounds like his brand of kitsch will get the deluxe treatment. Pre-orders aren’t yet open for the set, but the 4K Blu-ray will retail for $49.95, with a standard Blu-ray at $39.95.

As much fun as this new cover art is, there's something so goddamn great about the original poster art that I'll miss. Either way, happy to add this to the CC and will be buying day 1.

This line confuses me. Am I just reading it wrong? "After actor Shelley Duvall introduced Reubens to Burton at a party, and together watched his film Frankenweenie, the actor insisted to WB that the young animator direct his live-action movie."Frankenweenie came out in 2012, like 30 years after this movie?

Easily the best Burton film, thanks to Reubens.
