Critical Role has released the official trailer for the highly anticipated Campaign 4, which dares to ask: What comes next for those who live in a world where all the gods are dead? The multimedia company has been teasing drips and drabs of what players can expect from Campaign 4, with the latest being a reveal of the weird, wonderful, and yes, freakishly hot, cast of characters that will make up the 13-member adventuring party. Instead of roaming through Exandria, the fantasy world where Vox Machina (Campaign 1), The Mighty Nein (Campaign 2), and Bells Hells (Campaign 3) took place, this new adventure will take place in the world of Aramán. And as the trailer reveals, a lot is going on in this new world that has led it and its people to become fractured. The description for Campaign 4, highlighted by the trailer on YouTube, is as follows:
Hero to many. Enemy to some. When Thjazi Fang is marked for execution, various figures from across his remarkable life unite to uncover the truth behind his grim fate. In a land still suffering from the fallout of dead gods and living in the shadow of a tumultuous rebellion, these disparate people will come together across the fractured world of Aramán and connect in ways they never imagined. As hope and victory fade, a question hangs over Aramán. Without the Gods, what great deeds now fall to us? And who, or what, shall grab their crown for themselves?
"Various figures from across his remarkable life unite" seems to refer to the adventuring party, made up of the Critical Role founders Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Liam O’Brien, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham, as well as newcomers to the main cast, Luis Carazo, Robbie Daymond, Aabria Iyengar, Whitney Moore, and Alex Ward. Leading them this time around will be award-winning storyteller and Game Master Brennan Lee Mulligan. Featuring a rotating tables format, and West Marches–inspired style of play, Campaign 4's tables will be distinct in style: there will be the Soldiers, the Seekers, and the Schemers. What we can expect from these tables has yet to be revealed, but we're eager to find out more when Critical Role Campaign 4 premieres on Oct. 2. Beacon users will have instant access on Beacon.tv, with simultaneous streams on Critical Role’s YouTube and Twitch channels. VODs will be available for all viewers the following Monday.
