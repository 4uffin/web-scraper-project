Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar has 12 marriage candidates for you to romance, with some of them only unlocking as you rank up the town's market. These bachelors and bachelorettes can all be romanced regardless of what gender you pick in the beginning of the game, so you'll have a wide selection of suitors, including two new characters who weren't in the original Nintendo DS game. Below we list all the characters you can romance and marry in Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, as well as some recommended early-game gifts you can give. Note that we don't list all of their favored gifts, just the ones that worked for us early on.
Arata

Arata is a new character that wasn't in the original DS game. He's a martial artist who loves the outdoors. Arata showed up after our bazaar hit rank two. After doing so, he appeared in a cutscene and started showing up in the mountains to the west of the town. While this isn't a "loved" gift, the easiest thing to give Arata early on is sashimi, which he likes. You can make sashimi in your kitchen using a ton of different fish, including dace, pale chub, and bitterlings.
Derek

Derek is Jules' younger brother and a waiter at the local café. He's much more laid back than his brother, but he's working hard to become a respectable adult. He loves rhinoceros beetles, maya beetles, and elephant beetles, which show up at night on the trees in the summer. He likes stag beetles and giant stag beetles, but note that it's only "like" and not "love." If you don't want to wait until summer, he also likes gold, silver, and bronze medals.
Diana

Diana is another new character that wasn't in the original game. She's a member of the Bazaar Review Board and is quite serious. Diana moved into Zephyr Town after our bazaar hit rank two. Just like Arata, she appears in a cutscene after doing so, and will be available to find roaming around town after. She's also a tough nut to crack, as we couldn't find an easy early-game gift that she loved. She does like cookies so you can always give those to her. You can make the cookies using eggs and wheat flour in your kitchen, or you can buy them from Madeleine for 459g.
Freya

Freya works in the city, but you can still find her around town, especially stopping in the café after work. She's very detail-oriented and wants to learn about different hobbies. She loves peridot and moonstone, which you can find by mining silver and copper ore, respectively.
Gabriel

Gabriel is a kind artist who you can often spot in front of an easel painting the scenery. We admittedly struggled to find an early-game item that Gabriel "loved," but you can give him cookies, which he does like. Once you get access to cows and milk, you can also make omelet rice, which is Gabriel's favorite gift to get. You'll need one omelet (one egg and one butter) and one cooked rice to make omelet rice. You can buy these components individually from Madeleine's shop, too. You can get the recipe for omelet rice from the bookshelf inside of Gabriel's house.
Jules

Jules is Derek's older brother, who is a very polite tutor who teaches in the city. Two of his loved gifts are chamomile and mint, flowers you can find growing all over Zephyr Town.
June

June is a fashionable city girl who moved to the town with her father. She can be a little prickly in her tone, but does have a caring heart. She loves the chartreuse brooch and black necklace you can make in the red windmill. The black necklace requires one moonstone and one silver ore, and the chartreuse brooch requires one peridot and one silver ore.
Kagetsu

Kagetsu is a mysterious shrine maiden who lives in a hidden corner of the mountains. To unlock Kagetsu, you'll need to hit bazaar rank three and then visit the mountains, where you'll see a portal to Kagetsu open behind the waterfall. She loves some soy-based products, but the only early-game soy item you can get your hands on is soy milk, which you can buy from Madeliene for 119g.
Lloyd

Lloyd is a traveling merchant who specializes in geology. Lloyd loves gold medals, which you can get from completing achievements or from digging up the little dirt clumps around Zephyr Town with your hoe. If you don't want to cough up your medals, you can also give him magic blue flowers, found in spring, which he likes. You can also give him bugs like the smallheaded locust, ruby ladybug, or seven-spotted ladybug.
Maple

Maple is an energetic girl who works at the hotel as a maid. She's diligent and cheerful, always thrilled to make hotel customers happy. One of the early loved gifts to give her is cookies, which you can make with eggs and wheat flour in your kitchen. You can also buy cookies from Madeleine, as mentioned above.
Samir

Samir is another mysterious character, coming to Zephyr Town from abroad. To unlock Samir, you'll need to rank your bazaar to four. After doing so, a cutscene will play and Samir will show up in town. The simplest early game item that he loves is cooked rice, which you can make yourself using one rice. You can also buy it from Madeleine for 127g.
Sophie

Sophie is the kindhearted daughter of the mayor. She worries about her father, but also finds joy in helping the townspeople. The easiest and best thing to give to Sophie is a herb salad, which you can make in your kitchen using two mint, camomile, or lavender.
