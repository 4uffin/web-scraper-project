We asked Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson if the U.S. is ready for an infected outbreak like the one that has swept through Britain in 28 Days Later and 28 Years Later.

Is this a joke question? Eradicated diseases are making a comeback, and a conspiracy theorist who doesn't understand science is destroying public health.

I am going to use 28 weeks later as the example. It should of gone global not stayed in Britain come on. Granted since Trump was president during when covid first came out and he pretty much did nothing before hand as it was spreading around the world. I would imagine herr trump would do nothing til it actually inside the US. Of course it will be too late by then.
