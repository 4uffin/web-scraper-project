Why are you guys always spoiling movies and TV shows? I follow Polygon for the gaming and occasional tech news - not to have TV shows ruined by your spoiler-filled headlines. This happens all the time - why???Guess I'll have to stop reading Polygon and find another website for my gaming news.

There should be at least a 30 day spoiler-free window. The show literally JUST ended this week. Sorry they spoiled a major reveal for you.

illegalmonkey 30 days feels excessive, and would frankly be unproductive for Polygon -- the intensity of the conversation around the show is now, not in a month! Few will care by then.But more than 24 hours would be appreciated. In the streaming era, we aren't all watching a show as it airs, but usually the next couple days, when we have the time. That said, the headline is spoiling something from two or three weeks ago, so... y'all are really late at this point. Most of the audience is well ahead of you.

Why are you insisting on putting spoilers in titles? It's terrible practice and bad for your readers.
