Hades 2 is finally in 1.0 after almost a year and a half in early access. I’ve scarcely been able to pull myself away from it over the past two weeks, and pretty soon my playtime with Hades 2 will eclipse that of the first game. Though I don’t have a beefy gaming rig, I technically could have been playing Hades 2 a lot sooner in early access via my Steam Deck, but I’m so glad I didn’t. Waiting for 1.0 before playing Hades 2 was absolutely the right call. Hades 2 in its fully realized form is a splendid sight to behold, with developer Supergiant Games flexing its collective artistic talent. In early access? The gods were hot, yes, but everyone’s favorite merchant Charon didn’t have a complete design yet and someone like poor Narcissus was only just fully revealed in June. Other final artwork, like Melinoë’s now-gorgeous Arcana Cards, were also added over time. Those are just the superficial aspects, though; Melinoë’s arsenal of Nocturnal Arms was consistently tinkered with throughout the early access period, and they weren’t all available until the game’s first major update five months later. That Olympic Update, like the Warsong and Unseen Updates after it, brought major changes to the game. It introduced a whole new area and more story content and dialogue. That right there is the real crux of why waiting for 1.0 feels like the right decision. So much of the joy in Hades and Hades 2 comes from interacting and bonding with their casts of gods, incarnates, and other characters. To play through the game without the full cast available — someone like Ares, for example, wasn’t added until nine months in — and without their dialogues complete would be to miss out on so much of what makes these games rewarding.

Waiting for Hades 2 to fully launch is par for the course for me. I’m the type who loves to escape into a great game, spending hours and hours during one play session like I’m a Twitch streamer trying to rack up subs over the course of an eight-hour stream. Because of this, however, sometimes I get burned out by games by playing them too much, too quickly. (I’m working on it.) Getting burned out on Hades 2 before it was even completed sounds like a capital-B Bummer. It’s the reason why I wait to play nearly every early access release; I don’t want to get full on a half-baked meal. Sure, I could always return to a game once it graduates to 1.0, but there are just too many new games to play. I don’t think I’d be nearly as excited for Hades 2’s full launch if I had already pumped countless hours into the still-baking version of it, especially with new and upcoming releases like Silent Hill f and Ghost of Yōtei vying for my playtime. The one time I tried an early access title? No Rest for the Wicked in spring 2024, and it crashed twice in 20 minutes on my Steam Deck. It’s now Steam Deck verified, so maybe I should give it another shot, though really I’ll wait for its full release, which, like Hades 2, will allow me to enjoy Moon Studios’ ARPG in its complete glory. For now — back to Hades 2. I’ve got plenty to catch up on. So for the next little while at least, when I find some time to kill, I’ve got the Titan of Time to kill.

This is kind of a weird article! Both because it’s impossible to know how you would feel about something like this if you’d gone about it differently, and because it kind of reads as someone who’s trying to convince themself that they made the right decisionI’ve already put more time into Hades 2 than I put into most games, and I’ve had tons of fun watching this game grow and evolve. From the small tweaks that give you a peak into how Supergiant thinks about and creates games, to the way some of the characters have gone from placeholder art to rough sketches to final artwork to final artwork with all the effects added to make the art pop even more. It was a fun experience that you don’t always get to see, and I’m glad I went along with them on the journey. And now that that journey is over, I’m stoked to start a new game and see what their final vision looks like

I feel the same way. I would rather wait for the game to be finished before playing. I already have so many other games to play, I am in no rush. I also find I will burn myself out on a game, even when I really enjoy it. Sometimes its so hard to return to a game after recovering from the burnout though so I find it rare to finish a game unless its concise and less than 20 hours.

I played through the whole early access period, and I don't regret it at all. Seeing the art evolve has been great, but also I've been DYING to see where bits of the story go. It's been such a great way to parcel out the story to me. It's like I've seen the first couple of seasons and now I'm getting to the finale. I'm not going to start a new save this time (yet), but I'm gonna hit the bosses right away and finally see what I've been missing.

Not a single line in here highlighting what's different between yesterday and today. This is games journalism in a nutshell, all fluff, no information.

I agree, I played version 1 that just released and was like "nope I am going to wait until it gets a couple of updates deep," for me I would just rather play the completed version, and early access games will always have bugs which is what I was running into with this game. I see the 1.0 reviews now and that made me happy I stopped playing on day one because I didn't want my experience to be ruined.

You just mean on other consoles, right? Because it's releasing for PC and Mac today as well.
