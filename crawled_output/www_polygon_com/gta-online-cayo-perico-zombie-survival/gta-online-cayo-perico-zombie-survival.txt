Rockstar just unveiled Grand Theft Auto Online's newest feature: a new zombie-survival challenge in Cayo Perico. Despite its beauty, Cayo Perico has always had its issues (namely unchecked drug trafficking), but now those issues also include loads of aggressive undead roaming the streets. The ultimate goal in Cayo Perico Zombie Survival is to shoot your way through multiple waves of zombies and escape to the airstrip unscathed for extraction. But these aren't your average zombies — Cayo Perico's army of undead includes musket-armed conquistadors, Splitters, and Panther Trainers (along with their zombified Panthers), making survival a challenge.
On the bright side, you'll get a free t-shirt regardless of whether or not you actually survive. Players who check out Cayo Perico Zombie Survival through Sept. 10 will earn the free I Survived Cayo Perico Tee, which Rockstar says will be delivered to players within 72 hours of checking out the new mode, which can be launched by selecting the Cayo Perico Series on your in-game phone, or by heading to the palm tree corona in Terminal. Of course, there are also rewards for players who relish a challenge. Survive all 10 waves of Cayo Perico Zombie Survival, and you'll earn The Buccaneer Outfit in addition to GTA$100,000.
