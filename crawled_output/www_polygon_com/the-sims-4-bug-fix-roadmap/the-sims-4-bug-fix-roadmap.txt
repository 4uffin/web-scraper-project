It's been a turbulent couple of weeks for The Sims 4 and those who play it. A recent game update introducing a "DLC disabler" has reportedly left many players with corrupted save files, while others say they can't even get the game to launch. Despite these issues, EA is moving forward with the launch of yet another DLC pack for The Sims 4, but given the state of the game, some players are hesitant to give the new expansion pack a try. It seems that EA finally got the message, however, and recently shared a bug-fix roadmap to give players an idea of what issues will be fixed and when.
The post included a link to EA's new The Sims 4 quality of life roadmap, which reveals that although the upcoming Adventure Awaits expansion will launch on Oct. 2 as originally planned, EA plans to spend the next eight weeks fixing the game's biggest issues, from game-breaking save file corruption to busted DLC packs. "Our top priority is to provide a fun, positive experience for all players," the roadmap reads. "We see your feedback on technical issues and game performance. And, we want to assure you that your concerns are heard. Today, we're sharing the steps we’re taking to double our efforts, ensuring Simmers have the best experience possible with The Sims 4." Those steps include a base game update for Mac and Windows PC on Sept. 18 (console players will get the update on Sept. 23), though EA says it will share more information on the contents of the base game update via a "Laundry List" update which will be shared with players on Sept. 16. The rest of the month will be spent focusing on "community-prioritized fixes," and EA is encouraging players to share (and upvote) any problems they're experiencing in-game on the EA Help Forums. "We're investigating and resolving issues based on votes in The Sims 4 Bug Report section of the EA Forums. Player upvotes are crucial in prioritizing fixes, and we're doubling down efforts to focus on the most impactful issues players want resolved. Each upvote you cast on a reported issue helps us determine which problems are causing the biggest disruptions across the community." October will be mainly focused on monitoring the situation and fixing any issues that may arise after Adventure Awaits launches, and EA says another major update will go live on Nov. 4. "Not only will you see fixes based on your feedback, but the update will also include some new, free content for all players," EA said of the November update. This is definitely good news for frustrated fans of The Sims 4, but as one Sims player noted on social media, this isn't the first time EA has promised fixes. "Y'all said this last year as well and then stopped for some reason..." the user wrote, linking to a May 2024 post from EA which also detailed a bug-fix roadmap. Surprisingly, EA responded to the player's call-out post. "While we resolved a number of issues, we are aware more work needs to be done, and so we're doubling our efforts," an EA representative replied. "Please report and upvote the issues that matter most to you — your participation directly shapes future updates."

My game is unplayable when i click on any of the lots.
In CAS, there are many glitches!
Words, traits, filter subcategories are missing.
Traits are blended in together...very blurry.
