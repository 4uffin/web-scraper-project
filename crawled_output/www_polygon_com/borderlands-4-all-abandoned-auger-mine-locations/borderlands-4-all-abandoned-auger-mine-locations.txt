The world of Borderlands 4 has many secrets to uncover, the abandoned Auger mines being one of them. Why were they abandoned? We don’t know! However, we do know that if you find an Auger mine and explore it, you will find a boss to fight, which means that you can acquire some powerful loot. If you plan on searching for these abandoned mines, we can help you. In this guide, you will learn all the abandoned Auger mine locations in Borderlands 4.
All abandoned Auger mine locations in Borderlands 4
Auger mines are small dungeons where, unlike the Order bunkers, you fight creatures that inhabit the world of Kairos. In most cases, you will find a sequence of tunnels and caves where you will need to fight a group of enemies before reaching the boss.

Before you can go after these hidden mines, you must have completed the “Shadow of the Mountain” main quest, and we advise you to have as many Safehouses and Silos unlocked as possible. Once you’re done with the main quest, it’s time to hunt down some bosses. All the mines are hidden behind a fake wall that glows, making spotting them quite simple when you get closer. When you find them, you just need to cross the fake walls to access the mine, and it will only be considered completed when you kill the boss. Completing a mine for the first time rewards you with 40 SDU tokens. Here’s a list of all the abandoned Auger mines in Borderlands 4 and the regions you can find them — consider using our interactive map to have a better understanding of each area:
Timid Kyle's Neglected Opening (Coastal Bonescape)
The Claim (Dissected Plateau)
The Pigeonhole (Grindstone of the Worthy)
Trinket Crevass (Ruined Sumplands)
Whistler's Maw (Cuspid Climb)
Bittervein (Stoneblood Forest)
The Toil of Spoiling Vis (Carcadia District)
Timid Kyle's Neglected Opening

This mine is located northeast of the Abandoned Post Safehouse in Coastal Bonescape. The entrance is inside a cave in front of a small lake. Do not jump into the immense hole in the ground in the middle of the cave. The entrance to Timid Kyle's Neglected Opening is on the right side.
The Claim

You can quickly find The Claim by teleporting to Zadra's Backup Plan in Dissected Plateau. Leave the room using the door beside the fast travel station and in the cave outside the base, follow the path to the right, heading north. The entrance to the mine will be to your right.
The Pigeonhole

The Pigeonhole is an Auger mine located in the Grindstone of the Worthy area, south of the Rustical Hurl Silo. It's best if you use this Silo as a reference because the entrance to the cave is only accessible from the north.
Trinket Crevass

The entrance to Trinket Crevass, a mine you find in the Ruined Sumplands area, is located on the east side of the wall in the northern part of this region. The best route to reach it is by teleporting to Judgement's Lapse, a Silo on the east side of the map, and making your way to the west.
Whistler's Maw

In the middle of the Cuspid Climb region, you can find the entrance to the Whistler's Maw Auger mine. There's only one entrance to the mine and it's in the south. In our experience, reaching the place is quicker if you use the Reliquary Silo to travel there. You will know you're in the right place because there are some small shrines next to the entrance.
Bittervein

In the farthest corner to the north in the Stoneblood Forest region, you will find the entrance to the Bittervein Auger mine. The place is protected by bronkhorns, but you can ignore them and head to the entrance of the mine. Luckily, there are two good fast travel options to help you reach this exact place: The Snowy Wells Safehouse and the Deathright Silo. Both are to the south of the mine, so which one you pick is up to you.
The Toil of Spoiling Vis

Hidden in the Carcadia District, you can only find the Toil of Spoiling Vis mine later in the game. To get to the entrance, start at the Final Defiance fast travel station and head southeast, passing over the opening in the wall. Once you're on the lower level, turn left. Follow the wall until you find an opening. Enter to find the entrance to the Toil of Spoiling Vis. Do you need more help with Borderlands 4? For those who are new to Kairos, check out our beginner’s guide before you get started and our best classes guide to find the right one for your playstyle. If you want to have fun with your weapons, be sure to read our guide on how to get more SDU tokens. We know that traversing the immense map of Kairos is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a vehicle, as well as fast travel points. And if you're already enjoying the endgame of Borderlands 4, don’t forget to check the weekly reset time for all current challenges.
