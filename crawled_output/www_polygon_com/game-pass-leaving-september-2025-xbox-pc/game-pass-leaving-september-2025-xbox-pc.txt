While Hades may headline the latest Xbox Game Pass additions, a small batch of titles are set to leave the service by the end of the month as well. Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor’s Edge will all be removed from the Game Pass library when September ends. These titles are the latest ports of the rebooted mainline Ninja Gaiden games, and all three titles were part of 2021's Master Collection. The Ninja Gaiden series previously had a home in arcades and on consoles like the NES. The original titles were side-scrolling action games, while the rebooted series went 3D and upped the difficulty. They also severely dialed up the violence, which is now a hallmark of the series. Your mileage may vary on how much the games' plot matters to you, but October's Ninja Gaiden 4 is billed as a direct sequel to the third game, so now's your chance to cram in as much ninja lore as possible before it comes out. Xbox Game Studios is publishing Ninja Gaiden 4 and dropping it on Game Pass day one. Ninja Gaiden 4 will be the third Ninja Gaiden release this year. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, a remaster of the second game, shadow dropped earlier this year, while the nostalgic Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound was a summer hit. Here's everything leaving Game Pass on Sept. 30:
Ninja Gaiden Sigma (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor’s Edge (Cloud, Console, and PC)
Terra Invicta (Game Preview) (PC)
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave the subscription service, Game Pass members can save up to 20% when purchasing them.

They did not up the difficulty, they continued it.

This site sure does post a lot of ads. Were you compensated by Microsoft for publishing this?
