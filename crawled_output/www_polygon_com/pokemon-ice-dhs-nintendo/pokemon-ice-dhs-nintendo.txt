The Pokémon Company
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is now posting Pokémon memes to propagandize its immigration crackdown and ICE raids, sparking backlash from fans of the game franchise, who are urging Nintendo and The Pokémon Company to take action. In a video posted to the DHS X account on Wednesday, the organization's social media team posted a video of raids and arrests by federal agents, setting it to the Pokémon animated series theme song and splicing it with footage of Ash Ketchum. The video accompanied the text "Gotta catch 'em all," and featured mugshots of suspects altered to look like Pokémon cards. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection X account chimed in with an attempt at humor of its own, calling Pikachu "Border Patrol’s newest recruit." Reached for comment, The Pokémon Company International provided Polygon with the following statement:
We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand. Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.
The tone-deaf video that spliced arrests and raids with a kids cartoon quickly drew ire from Pokémon fans. "Just incredible how this pack of morons keep finding more and more ways to be villainous," reads one top comment on Reddit. On X, Pokémon fans hoped for a strong response from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, a rare instance of fans urging in favor of legal action from the notoriously litigious game companies. "We need to channel all of the world's energy into [Nintendo] and [The Pokémon Company] to sue the FUCKING SHIT out of Homeland Security for unauthorized visual representation!" reads a top response to the DHS post. Others are pursuing somewhat more direct action, referring Pokémon fans to report the use of Nintendo's trademarks to its legal team. The Trump administration has brazenly used copyrighted music from artists who prefer not to be associated with it for many years. In 2024, The White Stripes sued the Trump campaign’s deputy director of communications for using their song "Seven Nation Army" in a video. The band later dropped that suit. The group joined a long list of artists who have issued cease and desist notices or otherwise legally opposed their music being used by Trump, his campaign, and the Republican National Convention to little tangible effect. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Border Patrol posted a propaganda video in June that featured The White Stripes' "We Are Going to Be Friends" just a few months ago on Instagram. Whether Pokémon fans' call to action will have any effect remains to be seen.

I contacted all the major media organizations and if I don't see more facts and appropriate action taken by Nintendo and Pokémon International I am for one boycotting them. First, on the grounds of using something as innocent as Pokémon to promote a nefarious agenda is unacceptable. I want to know before I boycott them, are they aware that their intellectual property is being grossly misused in this way? and what do they intend on doing about it? I've yet to see anything pointing to any response by either. I see it for what it is and I can say beyond any doubt, this is wrong on so many levels. I can see why the author is so upset and pointing out other blatant misuses of intellectual property. At least the artists took action. I am not seeing any appropriate action thus far. Please let us know if you find anything else out.

Ok folks, we really gotta lock the application box for Darkest Timeline. This is beyond disgusting, so thanks ICE for staying on brand.

I'm disappointed in the Nintendo company and the Pokemon company for doing nothing about this, letting the Department of Homeland Security and the government post offensive and racist videos with Pokemon music mocking immigrants.

Illegal immigration isn't a joke, this admin needs to take it much more serious. Chicago should be next.

Still waiting for them to clean up the crime in Washington that they promised, but they only seem to be adding to it.
The guy supposedly running things is one of the worst.

Arione Well, certainly we can see the dizzying heights your own refined humour sits at. What a dazzling bit of witty repartee

DocVerdant thats pretty embarassing for you to cry about it on the internet instead of having a life and having any sense of humour, dehumanizing? they are Illegal imigrants, they dehumanize normal citizens, do you understand what the term "Illegal" means?

@Venom It means someone living in a country without the paperwork denoting that they have the government's official permission to live permanently in that country. Do you truly and genuinely believe that that is inherently a violation of the human dignity of people who do have the proper paperwork and permission to live where they do, or did you just go with the first retort you could think of?
