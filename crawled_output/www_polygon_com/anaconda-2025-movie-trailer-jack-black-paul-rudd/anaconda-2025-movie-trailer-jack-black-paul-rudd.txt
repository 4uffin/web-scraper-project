No matter how Sony Pictures' reboot of giant snake movie Anaconda turns out, you have to admit the concept is solid: Two lifelong friends, facing a midlife crisis, finally fulfill their dream of remaking the 1997 creature feature starring Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube, Anaconda. But faced with budget issues and an oops-we-chopped-up-the-trained-snake production snag, the friend group decides to shoot it guerrilla style, only to come face to face with an actual giant anaconda that wants to eat them. The new Anaconda has some beloved names attached: Frequent jungle-goer Jack Black and Ant-Man-man Paul Rudd star as wannabe filmmakers Doug and Jeff, respectively. And based on the first trailer, released Wednesday, that Jack Black energy and Paul Rudd charm will go a long way to making Anaconda pretty easy to swallow. Watching Black get chased by a massive serpent with a boar carcass duct-taped to his back is why we go to the movies. Joining Black and Rudd in the new Anaconda are Steve Zahn, Thandiwe Newton, Daniela Melchior, and Selton Mello. Anaconda is directed by Tom Gormican (The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent), based on a script by Gormican and Kevin Etten (Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F). Anaconda, the reboot, slithers to movie theaters on Dec. 25.
