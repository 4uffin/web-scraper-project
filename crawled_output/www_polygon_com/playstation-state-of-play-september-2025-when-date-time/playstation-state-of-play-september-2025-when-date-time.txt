Sony Interactive Entertainment has a new State of Play showcase coming this Wednesday that promises news on games coming to PlayStation 5, including "an extended look at Saros," the next game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The PlayStation company promises to "share new looks at anticipated third-party and indie titles, plus updates from some of our teams at PlayStation Studios." The new State of Play showcase will stream on Sept. 24, at 2 p.m. PDT/5 p.m. EDT/11 p.m. CEST on PlayStation’s YouTube and Twitch channels. The show is expected to run more than 35 minutes, Sony said in a post on the PlayStation Blog.
SIE and PlayStation Studios' announced lineup also includes games like Sucker Punch Productions' Ghost of Yotei (due very soon, on Oct. 2), Bungie's Marathon, and Insomniac Games' Marvel's Wolverine. Sony’s most recent State of Play aired in June, and featured multiple game reveals, including Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles, Lumines Arise, Nioh 3, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement, and Romeo is a Dead Man.
