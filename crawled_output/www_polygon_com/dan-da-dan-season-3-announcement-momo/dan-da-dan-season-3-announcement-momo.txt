Just moments after the Dan Da Dan season 2 finale aired in Japan last week, the anime series was officially renewed for season 3. No release window or production details have been shared, but the story is expected to pick up right where it left off. And if the adaptation from animation studio Science Saru stays true to writer and illustrator Yukinobu Tatsu’s original manga, the new season will dive into the massive Space Globalists Arc, a key plotline spanning six volumes — surpassing the combined five volumes that fueled the “Cursed House” and “Evil Eye” arcs in seasons 1 and 2. But there's one thing that Dan Da Dan needs to change in season 3. Unlike the previous two seasons, I hope this third installment doesn't open with Momo getting assaulted. The first scene in season 1 shows Momo, the story's high school-aged female protagonist, getting kicked in the gut by her scummy older boyfriend for not putting out. She tries to kick him, but he blocks it and kicks her to the ground before he storms off. He never gets his comeuppance. Later on in the episode, Momo gets abducted by aliens, and they strip her down to her underwear and threaten to probe her, but she's saved by her new friend Okarun. Dan Da Dan season 2 opens in a similar way, but instead of alien probes, it's older creeps at a bathhouse.
It's off-putting, to say the least, and one of the things that kept me from starting season 2 once the assault started going viral. It's the worst aspect of an otherwise perfect series and something the anime could offset through its adaptation. After all, none of these assault moments has had any longer-lasting negative impact on her that's been explored so far. I admittedly haven't read the manga, but as an anime fan, I'd prefer if Science Saru just ditched this part of the story moving forward. When asked what Dan Da Dan is really about, AJ Beckles — the English voice of Okarun — explained, “There’s a lot of really deep stuff about agency and what it means in society, but at its heart, it’s just about kids. And that’s why so many people connect with it.” That theme of agency resonates, and it’s something I hope to see more of with Momo. She showed it early on when she confidently shut down her first boyfriend — a dismissal so decisive fans knew she’d never waste her time on another guy like him, especially after meeting the awkwardly endearing Okarun. Going forward, I’d like Momo’s confrontations with creeps to reflect that same strength. Not moments where she’s left to fail, get hurt, be rescued by Okarun, or have the encounter brushed off for comedy, but moments that let her truly take control.

"Not moments where she’s left to fail, get hurt, be rescued by Okarun, or have the encounter brushed off for comedy, but moments that let her truly take control."I don't know how you can interpret that considering she's the one that saves Okarun and herself in the pilot episode (he's pinned down against the wall as she awakens, then busts them out of the UFO), then she also saves herself again at the onsen (struggling underwater, she then busts out and disables her attackers).Both examples are displays of Momo's strength via her telekinesis/ESP. Both examples she has agency and wrests control of the situation. Is it exploitative? Sure. Is she some weak damsel that hasn't displayed power or needs rescue? No.

She's not a damsel, but she does have moments where she fails, gets hurt, is rescued by Okarun (even if she saves him right after), and moments that are brushed off as comedy in situations that involve SA.

Personally I never see the events surrounding Momo as exploitative. The alien probing situation was a mirror event with Okarun. It felt more like wish fulfillment in the author's part that any woman who is assaulted would have the power to fight back and all assailants need to their balls ripped out of them. The part where the alien's probe opens up to show blades. That was more like a wake up call for the audience. Like, "You think that's funny? How about now? This isn't funny." I also think it's cool that whenever Momo and Aira somehow end up only with their underwear, the design never looks sexual. As far as other anime goes where they draw large breasts and massive cleavage and ridiculous curves. Dandadan doesn't do that it seems. I dunno. It's sexually charged in some parts but it's always with the characters just goofing with each other, and as hormonal teenagers, it seems pretty normal.

Everyone at some point failed, got hurt, and rescued each other. Momo practically did most of the saving and conquered most of the enemies, and solved most of the problems in each arc. Even catching up in the manga, Momo is the one who keeps solving problems and doing all the carrying. Momo is the one who fails, gets hurt, and needs rescuing the least. The only comedic situation that involved SA was the first episode. But they quickly did that away when the alien started pulling out the razors, as if to say, "Oh you thought that was funny? How about now? This isn't funny." It also a mirror to Okarun's situation. It's more of wish fulfillment by the author, it seems, wishing that all women had the power to fight back and all the creeps gets their stuff cut off. The second situation didn't have a single touch of comedy. Those guys were just acting plain bad right off the start.

This was such a fruit cup article that made me make an account just to say that. If it bothered that much don’t watch. The creators shouldn’t have to tailor what they do with story because you wanna overthink scenes like that

I agree and I know this is a somewhat unpopular opinion, because I made a comment about how I didn't continue after the first episode due to the Momo assault scenes on a TikTok video about anime with weird sexualization and how it can ruin a show.The probing scene is the worst part, because it's not just that she's about to be SA'd. She's exposed and exaggerated suggestively as if it's meant to be enjoyed. Which feels very wrong.If I were to give the author and animators the benefit of the doubt, I could say that perhaps that scene was meant to make you uncomfortable in a way that assault scenes in shows and movies don't often make you feel. To give you a sense of how wrong it is. Especially seeing that she's only 16 years old.However, no one involved with the manga or anime have come out and said this. Also, a large portion of the fandom doesn't even seem to notice or care. If I'm to believe the people who responded to my comment on that video, it wasn't even something they registered. Which leads me to believe that oversexualization and SA jokes in anime and manga are so prevalent that the core audience is desensitized to it.I also brought up how Okarun is almost certainly SA'd by the perverted granny spirit who possesses him. Which also isn't okay. Even though it happened off-screen. However, that too is played off as a joke to the audience.Far be it from me to judge the viewing habits of other people. If it's legally obtainable, you do you. However, I personally don't have the capacity to brush off those scenes like so many do. As I did with the comment I made on the video, I will admit that a big part of why it's hard for me to watch is due to my own age and experience. I'm in my late 30s and seeing a teenager in that situation was disturbing to me. With that said, when I was a less learned and experienced 16 year old, I might not have seen the problem.It's just disappointing because I wanted to watch it after friends had told me how good it is.

Sure, let's turn everything into mushy, boring, witless goo Hollywood movies become recently. Richness of expression is exact reason viewers prefer to watch anime nowadays.If you don't like this, stick to Hollywood woke gems please and go playing damn snowflake eslewhere.

Exactly. Some people don't seem to know the difference between reality and fantasy and it shows. Snowflakes are ruining videogames and anime.

Manga readers laughing at the idea that MOMO would be the one getting assaulted in the first episode with how that season 2 finale ended 😂

Looks like the writer just looks away when things get too intense. Momo saved herself and kept doing awesome things. She was the one who beat that alien who invaded her home. She got herself out of that nasty situation in the first episode of Season 2. All her plans to beat their enemies always succeeded and I don't recall ever in the anime that Okarun saved her. I swear these articles are intentionally wrong just to stir some engagement. It worked though, got me typing. Though I do agree, the way season 1 ended and how season 2 started could have been better. Personally, it should have ended when Jiji first arrived.

ClownPrince Is season 2 over though? If it is... then, technically, season 3 will start with Okarun being the one SA'd. Though I don't think a lot of people will see it that way, no matter the reason thrown in the story.

"I admittedly haven't read the manga, but as an anime fan, I'd prefer if Science Saru just ditched this part of the story moving forward."Emphasis mine."I refuse to engage with this as-is, so the showrunners need to change things" is super cringe.

OhNoThisGuyAgain I'm not wrong though. It's a general running thing in popular anime, which I'm not bothered with, but expecting it when there's a source to draw from is asking a bit.

Alexander Hamilton Just popular anime, just a generalized term like pop music. I think it just kind of fits for series like this, SnK, DBZ, One Piece, etc that kind of thing. They all got a source material and all.

OhNoThisGuyAgain ima still watch no matter what. But like how anime always have to deviate or change things to not be a 1:1, they could change this up a bit.
