Just moments after the Dan Da Dan season 2 finale aired in Japan last week, the anime series was officially renewed for season 3. No release window or production details have been shared, but the story is expected to pick up right where it left off. And if the adaptation from animation studio Science Saru stays true to writer and illustrator Yukinobu Tatsu’s original manga, the new season will dive into the massive Space Globalists Arc, a key plotline spanning six volumes — surpassing the combined five volumes that fueled the “Cursed House” and “Evil Eye” arcs in seasons 1 and 2. But there's one thing that Dan Da Dan needs to change in season 3. Unlike the previous two seasons, I hope this third installment doesn't open with Momo getting assaulted. The first scene in season 1 shows Momo, the story's high school-aged female protagonist, getting kicked in the gut by her scummy older boyfriend for not putting out. She tries to kick him, but he blocks it and kicks her to the ground before he storms off. He never gets his comeuppance. Later on in the episode, Momo gets abducted by aliens, and they strip her down to her underwear and threaten to probe her, but she's saved by her new friend Okarun. Dan Da Dan season 2 opens in a similar way, but instead of alien probes, it's older creeps at a bathhouse.
It's off-putting, to say the least, and one of the things that kept me from starting season 2 once the assault started going viral. It's the worst aspect of an otherwise perfect series and something the anime could offset through its adaptation. After all, none of these assault moments has had any longer-lasting negative impact on her that's been explored so far. I admittedly haven't read the manga, but as an anime fan, I'd prefer if Science Saru just ditched this part of the story moving forward. When asked what Dan Da Dan is really about, AJ Beckles — the English voice of Okarun — explained, “There’s a lot of really deep stuff about agency and what it means in society, but at its heart, it’s just about kids. And that’s why so many people connect with it.” That theme of agency resonates, and it’s something I hope to see more of with Momo. She showed it early on when she confidently shut down her first boyfriend — a dismissal so decisive fans knew she’d never waste her time on another guy like him, especially after meeting the awkwardly endearing Okarun. Going forward, I’d like Momo’s confrontations with creeps to reflect that same strength. Not moments where she’s left to fail, get hurt, be rescued by Okarun, or have the encounter brushed off for comedy, but moments that let her truly take control.

"Not moments where she’s left to fail, get hurt, be rescued by Okarun, or have the encounter brushed off for comedy, but moments that let her truly take control."I don't know how you can interpret that considering she's the one that saves Okarun and herself in the pilot episode (he's pinned down against the wall as she awakens, then busts them out of the UFO), then she also saves herself again at the onsen (struggling underwater, she then busts out and disables her attackers).Both examples are displays of Momo's strength via her telekinesis/ESP. Both examples she has agency and wrests control of the situation. Is it exploitative? Sure. Is she some weak damsel that hasn't displayed power or needs rescue? No.

She's not a damsel, but she does have moments where she fails, gets hurt, is rescued by Okarun (even if she saves him right after), and moments that are brushed off as comedy in situations that involve SA.

Personally I never see the events surrounding Momo as exploitative. The alien probing situation was a mirror event with Okarun. It felt more like wish fulfillment in the author's part that any woman who is assaulted would have the power to fight back and all assailants need to their balls ripped out of them. The part where the alien's probe opens up to show blades. That was more like a wake up call for the audience. Like, "You think that's funny? How about now? This isn't funny." I also think it's cool that whenever Momo and Aira somehow end up only with their underwear, the design never looks sexual. As far as other anime goes where they draw large breasts and massive cleavage and ridiculous curves. Dandadan doesn't do that it seems. I dunno. It's sexually charged in some parts but it's always with the characters just goofing with each other, and as hormonal teenagers, it seems pretty normal.

Lmao, it is pop anime. So like, expecting something like that might be a bit much.

"I admittedly haven't read the manga, but as an anime fan, I'd prefer if Science Saru just ditched this part of the story moving forward."Emphasis mine."I refuse to engage with this as-is, so the showrunners need to change things" is super cringe.

OhNoThisGuyAgain I'm not wrong though. It's a general running thing in popular anime, which I'm not bothered with, but expecting it when there's a source to draw from is asking a bit.

Alexander Hamilton Just popular anime, just a generalized term like pop music. I think it just kind of fits for series like this, SnK, DBZ, One Piece, etc that kind of thing. They all got a source material and all.
