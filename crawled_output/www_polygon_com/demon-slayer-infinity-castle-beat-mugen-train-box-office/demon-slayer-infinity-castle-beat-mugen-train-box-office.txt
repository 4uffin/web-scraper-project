After Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle's incredible box office debut, the only question remaining was whether the movie could beat the record held by the franchise's previous feature film, Mugen Train. The answer is a resounding "yes." According to Box Office Mojo, Infinity Castle's worldwide gross is $555,003,707 at the time of writing, easily beating Mugen Train's previous record of $486,451,200 and becoming the highest-grossing anime movie of all time. While fans of the franchise were sure this would happen sooner or later, there were plenty of doubters still. Mugen Train's success was often attributed to the timing of its release. Coming out in the fall of 2020, during a brief respite from COVID-19 restrictions, it didn't have a lot of competition in movie theaters at the time. While these may still have been important factors, Infinity Castle's success proves that people simply love to watch Demon Slayer at the cinema. And for good reason.

A few fans may have found issues with the pacing and frequent flashbacks, but Infinity Castle is a visual spectacle that can be fully appreciated only on a big screen. Ufotable's production values are through the roof, and the studio truly went all out when bringing to life the endless labyrinth of the Infinity Castle, where new buildings spring to life constantly, creating a mesmerizing background for the bloody battle between the Demon Slayers and Muzan's strongest demons, the Upper Moons. It truly shows that, when a great anime studio is allowed to focus solely on a franchise for as much time as it takes, there is no limit to what they can achieve. The two Demon Slayer feature films sit solidly in the top two spots of the list of highest-grossing anime movies, while two Makoto Shinkai masterpieces, Your Name and Suzume, follow at number three and five. Anime maestro Hayao Miyazaki claims spots four and six with Spirited Away and The Boy and the Heron.

Amazing action scenes, interrupted by flashbacks that go on for far too long.

Those flashbacks are needed so you can see the other side of the story and to explain things.Without it it's just flashy fight and no stakes nor care about characters.If a flash back is too short or rushed it will have no impact and the whole show would be a fighting game speed run and it would be empty.

DarkcoreI have seen all seasons of Demon Slayer and I'm totally aware that these flashbacks are an integral part of the series. I also agree that the flashbacks offer a welcome reprieve inbetween the otherwise relentless barrage of fights.However, Infinity Castle simply overdoes it. For example, Shinobu's flashback comes back like three times to the moment she's holding her dying sister without really adding anything.Of Tanjiro's two flashbacks during the fight against Akaza, the one with Inosuke is completely superfluous, as the one with his father conveys the same information better (and it's a lot more poignant).I'm not arguing for dropping the flashbacks altogether, but they could have cut some fat by not adapting every single panel of the manga into minutes-long scenes without losing anything impactful, and easily could have shaved off 15, 20 minutes of the movie's two-and-a half hour runtime.
