Director Mike Roth shared his love for Joel Schumacher’s campy 1997 film Batman & Robin by making Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane part of an aging rogue’s gallery in his 2023 family-friendly Christmas movie Merry Little Batman. He’s paying further tribute to Batman & Robin in BAT-FAM, his animated sitcom coming to Prime Video in November. The follow-up to Merry Little Batman will see the return of Luke Wilson’s Batman taking on the challenges of raising young Damian Wayne (Yonas Kibreab) with the help of his faithful butler, Alfred Pennyworth (James Cromwell). Alfred is joined by his grandniece Alicia Pennyworth (London Hughes). The character’s name is a nod to Alicia Silverstone, who played Alfred’s niece Barbara Wilson, aka Batgirl, in Batman & Robin — a major shift Schumacher made from the comics, where Barbara is Commissioner Gordon’s daughter. Rather than donning a costume of her own, BAT-FAM’s Alicia Pennyworth will be working to rehabilitate former supervillains.

That work starts in Wayne Manor, which will be home to three supervillains who have fallen on hard times. Ra’s al Ghul (Michael Benyaer) has been effectively turned into a ghost due to a magical mishap, so instead of leading the League of Shadows he’s just doting on his grandson, Damian. Volcana (Haley Tju), the pyrokineticist introduced in a 1998 episode of Superman: The Animated Series, has been de-aged into a 12-year-old by the Lazarus Pit and is now playing the role of Damian’s sarcastic big sister. Man-Bat (Bobby Moynihan) is the family’s slacker roommate, squatting in the belfry and spending his time playing video games and raiding the fridge. BAT-FAM will follow the Bat-Family as they navigate domestic issues and try to keep Gotham safe, providing a cutesy alternative to the raunchy comedy of HBO Max’s Harley Quinn or Prime Video’s dark tribute to Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Caped Crusader. Fans will be able to get a first look at the show at an Oct. 11 sneak peek screening at New York Comic Con.

This feels weird to read. They can do anything with Batman, I don't care either way - but this show just feels so far removed from what Batman actually is - instead of like, using the Batman IP, couldn't they just make a new show? or like, would this show, not survive on it's own, without Batman as the hook?Like, we don't need another batman cartoon, we just need new shows.
Or is it not enough to be
a new show anymore? everything has to have a familiar IP hook?I dunno.

I'm sitting on the toilet reading about this, and now I have diarrhea. Warner Bros are seriously just burning down over 75 years worth of the legacy of one of the most iconic characters to ever grace the multimedia landscape. The Lego Movie's approach to making Batman a comic relief character was enough. Teen Titans Go was ridiculous and Harley Quinn was basically character assassination for the sake of "Look at the funny lesbian clown!". But THIS? Well, now this worn out trope has just overstayed it's welcome.Now I am just worried about how much further WB are willing to go before Batman enters public domain in 10 or so years time.
