In 1997, mangaka Hisao Tamaki attempted to capture the spirit of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope by reimagining the landmark motion picture through the lens of manga. The result was a bold, unforgettable adaptation that ultimately earned Tamaki the prestigious Eisner Award for Best U.S. Edition of Foreign Material. Now, nearly three decades later, Dark Horse Comics and Lucasfilm present a Kickstarter campaign for The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope—The Manga, a deluxe book that showcases Tamaki’s original, never-before-seen art boards. Dark Horse has meticulously scanned and assembled Tamaki-sensei’s original art boards to chronicle and showcase the creation of a unique artifact of pop culture. Remembering the project’s beginnings, Tamaki said, “The editor in charge of the project [at the time…] asked, ‘Would you like to draw Star Wars?’ and with zero hesitation or second thought, I responded, ‘A New Hope? Absolutely!’ I have to draw Star Wars.”
A retail edition arrives in Summer 2026, but fans can secure exclusive Kickstarter-only editions–and receive them before retail release by supporting now. The book is available through Kickstarter in multiple deluxe editions, including:
The Collector’s Edition is a two-volume hardcover set presenting Tamaki’s artwork in high resolution, with Kickstarter-exclusive cover and a new English translation that’s taken directly from Tamaki’s handwritten Japanese text. This edition is perfect for fans looking to read the masterful adaptation for the first time, with the new translation included in the margins to preserve the original Japanese lettering. The books are printed on archival-quality stock to showcase Tamaki’s intricate linework and rich tones. While a retail version featuring a different cover will be available in 2026, the Kickstarter-exclusive Collector’s Edition features exclusive designs distinguished by bold use of blue and red —a visual nod to the light and dark sides of the Force, as well as special treatments that will not be offered anywhere else.
The Collector’s Edition - Tamaki Variant is a minimalist, art-forward reinterpretation of the Collector’s Edition, limited to 260 sets.
The Collector’s Edition + Slipcase. The complete two-volume Collector’s Edition, presented with a custom black slipcase.
Deluxe Signed Collector’s Edition. An extremely limited version of the Collector’s Edition—only 250 sets will be produced exclusively for Kickstarter backers.
The Masterpiece Edition is a large-format, premium release that faithfully presents Hisao Tamaki’s original work, with high-resolution reproductions of his unaltered art at its original size—10.85” x 15.05”. Collected in a faux-leather clamshell case, the two 176-page volumes of this edition are accompanied by a separate 104-page companion book that contains a new translation of the authentic Japanese lettering, which itself was inspired by the alternate language dub of the film that has been enjoyed by Japanese-speaking audiences for generations. The Masterpiece Edition format is only available through Kickstarter and will not be produced for retail.
The Signed Masterpiece Edition, a definitive version of the Masterpiece Edition featuring special enhancements, limited to only 250 sets worldwide.
The Signed Darth Vader Masterpiece Edition (Limited to 25), the rarest edition of the campaign, limited to only 25 sets worldwide to backers, combining the full Masterpiece Edition with exclusive Darth Vader-inspired features.
As part of the Kickstarter, collectors can also pick up the Tamaki Art Print Set, a curated selection of six standout pages from Star Wars: A New Hope—The Manga. Though originally drawn in black and white, each print has been faithfully reproduced in full color, highlighting every detail, from pencil strokes and paste-ups to editorial notes and even the natural aging of the paper. For those looking for something more expansive, the campaign also offers the Tamaki Art Triptych Folio, a large-format, three-panel set designed to match the height of the Masterpiece Edition and featuring two complete triptych print collections. The standard edition of The Art of Star Wars: A New Hope — The Manga is slated to hit comic shops and bookstores in summer 2026. But fans eager to secure Kickstarter-exclusive editions — and get them ahead of the retail release — can do so by backing the campaign.
