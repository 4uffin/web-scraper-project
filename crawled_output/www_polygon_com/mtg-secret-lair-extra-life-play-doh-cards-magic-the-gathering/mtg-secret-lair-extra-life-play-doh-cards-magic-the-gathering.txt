Magic: The Gathering just announced the start of its yearly collaboration with Extra Life, the fundraising program to help children's hospitals. This year's initiatives begin with a new Secret Lair drop, Secret Lair X Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking, which includes four cards that are staples of the Commander format, now available with exquisitely cute art inspired by the popular modeling compound. Greensleves, Maro-Sorcerer first appeared in a Dominaria United Commander deck, and is a popular card in landfall and ramp strategies for its ability to generate Badger tokens. Polyraptor made its debut in the dinosaur-themed set Rivals of Ixalan, and is played not just in tribal decks but also in combo strategies that plan to abuse its ability to generate copies of itself. Wurmcoil Engine and Academy Manufactor are both commonly played in Commander decks, the former for being a classic colorless value creature, and the latter for its easy combo potential.
None of these cards are particularly expensive (assuming you no longer gasp at the concept of a $15 Magic card), but overall, these are welcome reprints even if you don't care about the adorable Play-Doh-inspired art. The cards all share the ability to produce tokens, as a reference to the creativity that Play-Doh inspired in generations of children. Wizards will also further support the charity with a fundraising Magic x Extra Life Game Day livestream on Twitch, running from 11 a.m. PT to 10:30 p.m. PT on Nov. 8. The Squishful Thinking Secret Lair drop will be available at MagicSecretLair.com from Sept. 29 to Nov. 9, and will be printed to demand (a welcome change from the limited printings of some recent Secret Lairs). Additionally, this Secret Lair will also be available in limited quantities at the MagicCon: Atlanta merch booth from Sept. 26–28. The non-foil set is priced at $39.99, and the foil one at $49.99. Half of the purchase price will go to support Extra Life and the kids and families at Seattle Children's Hospital.
