The Hollow Knight: Silksong Fourth Chorus boss fight is a mandatory scuffle between Hornet and a giant robot determined to bring the house down. Fourth Chorus may telegraph its attacks clearly, but the way it manipulates the environment means you need to keep on your toes and be aware of what's going on around you at all times. In our Silksong Fourth Chorus guide, we've broken down Fourth Chorus' moveset, how to attack its weak point, and what you get when the fight ends. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

Fourth Chorus is lying dormant in the lower part of Silksong's Far Fields region. If you enter the region after defeating Lace in Deep Docks, continue heading right until you reach the first large vertical chamber. To your right is a small room where Shakra set up shop, and below that is another exit. This one takes you to the Fourth Chorus arena, and you'll see it in the background. However, it won't activate this time. Continue to the right, meet the Seamstress and complete her "Flexile Spines" request in the next room to get the Drifter's Cloak, and then return to the previous room to bring Fourth Chorus to life.
Fourth Chorus' moveset

Fourth Chorus only uses three moves, though they get faster as the fight progresses.
Hand slam: Fourth Chorus raises one of its hands and slams it down at a slightly diagonal angle, destroying a chunk of the ground in the process. The hand remains raised for a second before Fourth Chorus brings it down, and it shines as well, which gives you time to move out of the way. Destroyed ground reappears after a few seconds, and you can use your newfound Drifter's Coat to glide between safe places.
Big swipe: Fourth Chorus lowers one hand to ground level and sweeps it across the arena. Jump to avoid it, and use this opportunity to attack Fourth Chorus' face if you can. Like the slam attack, the boss telegraphs this one by pausing before the swipe and with a telltale flash.
Roof smack: Fourth Chorus raises both hands and hits the roof, causing a shower of molten stones to rain down. It usually follows this attack with a slam or swipe, so you'll want to pay close attention to safe areas and make good use of the Drifter's Cloak to avoid hands and lava while you're dodging falling rocks.
How to prep for Fourth Chorus

Hornet's skills and tools are limited at this point in Silksong, which is fine, since most of them wouldn't work on Fourth Chorus anyway. With the automaton's sole weak point being its face, the only way Hornet can attack is by jumping and swiping. The pauses before Fourth Chorus attacks and in between attacks are the safest times for you to strike, though it's a sturdy boss and doesn't go down quickly. Use the bench in the Seamstress' home before setting out, so you respawn here if you die. It's close, with few obstacles and enemies on the path from the bench to Fourth Chorus, so it's the ideal runback. On the off-chance you end up needing some extra silk before the battle, there's a hidden nook with some silk webs when you enter from the room on the right. Use the second, longer updraft to reach it.
Fourth Chorus rewards
For defeating Fourth Chorus, you get the "Servant" achievement and nothing else. Clearing the fight doesn't open a new pathway or lead you to a fresh skill, though it's a mandatory battle. Obtaining the Drifter's Cloak from the Seamstress is essential for progressing further toward the Citadel, and the only path back from the Seamstress' home takes you through the Fourth Chorus arena. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish or "Silver Bells" request, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.

For an article titled, "How to Defeat Fourth Chorus...", it seems odd to leave out the final phase of the fight and... how you actually defeat him. After he is dazed/stunned for the third time, air streams flowing upward will appear on either side of the battle zone. Use them to float up and attack the magma balls lodged in the ceiling, they will explode and a giant boulder will fall, crushing Fourth Chorus and ending the fight.
