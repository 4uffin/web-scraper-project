Why It MattersPalworld helps itself to a heaping buffet of other open world survival game mechanics, and while there's very little innovation to be found, the game is still a pleasing pastiche of popular trends. The Pals, friendly pocket monsters, are a fun addition to spice up some of these well-worn trends.
