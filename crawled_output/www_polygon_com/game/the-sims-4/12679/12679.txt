The Sims 4 is the latest offering from Maxis and The Sims Studio, serving as a sequel to The Sims 3. Although it was released back in 2014, the game is still going strong today thanks to an array of DLC add-on packs that give players access to more unlockable items and events.

Why It MattersThere are very few games that are just as popular 10 years after release; The Sims 4 is one of them. There simply isn't a life simulator and building game like it elsewhere, despite attempts from other developers.
