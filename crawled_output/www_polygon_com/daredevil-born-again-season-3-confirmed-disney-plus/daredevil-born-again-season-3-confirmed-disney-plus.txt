Daredevil: Born Again has been greenlit for a third season, according to Marvel Studios' head of streaming, television, and animation Brad Winderbaum. "In terms of Daredevil, yeah, we are greenlit for Season 3 and we start shooting next year," Winderbaum told IGN. The sequel series to the original Netflix Daredevil show went through a turbulent development period, and was overhauled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes. It was originally supposed to be an 18-episode series, so Born Again returning for season 2 in 2026 isn't too surprising. But after Charlie Cox called season 2 the show's "final season," viewers were naturally left wondering about the fate of the Man Without Fear. Turns out, that fate is a third season. Daredevil: Born Again will return in 2026, and the titular hero will be joined by a familiar face. Krysten Ritter is set to reprise her role as Jessica Jones in the show's second season, reuniting half of the Defenders. (No word yet on if Mike Colter's Luke Cage or Finn Jones' Iron Fist will be tagging along.) Jon Bernthal's Punisher is expected to return as well, and he'll also star in his own television special in 2026. Season 2 of Daredevil: Born Again will see Daredevil leading vigilantes in a fight against Mayor Wilson Fisk and his Anti-Vigilante Task Force. It seems to pull inspiration from recent Daredevil comics, which fans of the show should definitely check out.
