Marvel Zombies finally delivers on the potential of What If...?

Marvel Zombies is a classic zombie apocalypse road trip story following a group of heroes trying to fight back against the undead. And like with so many road trips, the journey is better than the destination not only because the final moments of the show rely on a cliché plot twist, but because the miniseries actually delivers its most shocking moment in its penultimate episode instead. [Ed. note: This article contains major spoilers for Marvel Zombies, including the ending] Marvel Zombies is a disturbing followup to both the What If… ? episode “What If… Zombies?!” and WandaVision, with the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) serving as the greatest threat to the living. In her role of Queen of the Dead, Wanda Maximoff is able to bring hordes of regular zombies and undead heroes under her sway, using her forces to destroy the last bastions of civilization through a mix of force and trickery. Wanda’s ultimate goal is to claim the unlimited power of the Infinity Stones that the Hulk absorbed after the artifacts were destroyed during a battle with zombie Thanos. But she can’t do it alone, and spends the four-episode miniseries psychically stalking Kamala Khan (Imam Vellani), whose own powers come from channeling cosmic energy. After Wanda’s forces kill or infect most of Kamala’s allies in a big final battle meant to protect the Hulk, Wanda persuades Kamala that joining her wouldn’t be a betrayal of their efforts but would actually allow her to bring them all back.

Kamala reluctantly agrees, joining hands with Wanda who says, “And so the world begins again.” A burst of energy that resembles the animation for Kamala’s constructs blankets the whole planet and seemingly restores it. But as Kamala revels in the joy of drinking boba with her friends, her vision shifts to once again show shambling zombies in a ruined landscape. Kamala sees Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) engaged in a desperate battle begging her not to believe her eyes. The show’s very last moment shows the screaming visage of undead Wanda. I’m not sure what showrunner Bryan Andrews and writer Zeb Wells meant by this ending. Are they setting up a possible second season, or did they just want to close the show with one last disturbing twist? Wanda’s reality warping powers could have allowed her to actually fix the world, especially when combined with the might of the Infinity Stones and Kamala helping her channel their energy. In the comics, Wanda is so powerful she both crafted a world where mutants rule everything and almost wiped mutantkind out. But Wanda’s other primary power involves messing with perceptions, something she used to devastating effect in Marvel Zombies by serving the Asgardians human flesh to infect them. The finale seems to imply that Wanda is actively messing with Kamala’s perceptions to distract her from a battle in progress. Since Ironheart died in the first episode of Marvel Zombies, that implies most of Kamala’s journey throughout the miniseries was just a hallucination.

This feels like a big cop out, combining the “it was all a dream trope” with the cliché of a villain trapping a character in a beautiful fantasy, like in Alan Moore’s seminal 1985 Superman story, For the Man Who Has Everything. The shifts in Kamala’s perceptions work as jarring visuals, but as a plot twist, they feel hollow. Wells and Andrews presented a much more surprising twist at the end of Marvel Zombies episode 3. The purpose of Kamala’s dangerous road trip is to use a shrunken S.H.I.E.L.D. device that might help save the world if they can get into space to broadcast a distress signal into the galaxy. But the MacGuffin proves worthless when Kamala finally gets to outer space to use it to signal the Nova Corps, only to find out that the intergalactic peacekeepers are already well aware of the zombie plague. Rather than attempt to help, they’ve decided that the best solution is to quarantine Earth. Not only is the Nova Corps unwilling to help Kamala and her allies, they nearly kill them to prevent the possibility of contamination. It’s a devastating turn of events, pushing forward the miniseries’ dominant question of what it means to be a hero when the world seems beyond saving. Kamala might be able to scrounge up some more allies among Earth’s survivors, but no one else is coming to help. That desperate position makes Kamala willing to put her faith in Wanda’s promise to remake the world despite her better instincts because the alternative is just to watch everyone around her die horribly. The flash of energy that surges over the planet would have been a better place to end Marvel Zombies than Wanda’s screaming face, offering just as much ambiguity about whether Kamala has helped Wanda heal the world or just sealed her fate. It also would have been a more fitting conclusion for a story that spun out from What If, providing a blank slate with endless possibilities of what the next spin on the MCU might look like.

Ironheart didn't die in the first episode. She injected herself with a cure and then ironman's body went back to save her. They didn't show her fate but the implication was that she survived.
