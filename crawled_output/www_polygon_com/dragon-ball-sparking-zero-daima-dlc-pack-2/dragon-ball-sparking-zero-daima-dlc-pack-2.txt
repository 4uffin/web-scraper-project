Dragon Ball Daima's Super Saiyan 4 Goku, King Gomah, and more are set to make their Dragon Ball Sparking Zero debut next week. After months of anticipation and a delay, Bandai Namco released a trailer for the Dragon Ball Daima: Character Pack 2 on Friday. It showcases characters and transforations that get the spotlight in the back half of the anime series, like adult Super Saiyan Vegeta 3 (I've now found my new main). Notably, Piccolo and Supreme Kai are not included in the charcter pack, and mini versions of them seemingly won't be making their way to Sparking Zero. The trailer also reveals a new stage, which will be free for all players. You'll be able to recreate the final battle versus Gomah when the First Demon World stage arrives. Unlike the first Daima character pack, which only had Japanese audio, this new trailer includes English voices for the new characters. Dragon Ball Daima: Character Pack 2 marks the end of Dragon Ball Sparking Zero's season pass content, which, all told, included 25 characters and transformations from Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero and Dragon Ball Daima. Polygon has reached out to Bandai Namco asking if this marks the end of support for the game, or if players can expect more content to be added to Dragon Ball Sparking Zero over time. The next round of Daima characters arrives Wednesday Sept. 24, and season pass owners will have 72-hour early access starting Sunday Sept. 21. A new patch also arrives on Sunday, bringing gameplay adjustments and other tweaks alongside the new stage. Dragon Ball Sparking Zero launched last fall to a positive reception, though its lack of game modes, costumes, and stages has left players wanting. It's available on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X, and comes to Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on Nov. 14.
