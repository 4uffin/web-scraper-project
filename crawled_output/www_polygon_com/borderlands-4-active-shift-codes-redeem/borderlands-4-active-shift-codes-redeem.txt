When playing Borderlands 4, acquiring new guns is always a good thing, especially when they are free, which you can do by claiming the special rewards Shift codes give you. When you redeem Shift codes, you might receive a new cosmetic or even a gun, but the majority of the time, you will receive valuable Golden Keys. You need these to open the Golden Chests present in the game and earn free guns and gear. Because Shift codes can expire, it's important to use them as soon as you can. Below, you learn how to redeem Shift codes in Borderlands 4 and find the new Borderlands 4 Shift codes.

How to redeem Borderlands 4 Shift codes
There are two methods to redeem Shift codes in Borderlands 4. The first is by using the in-game Shift system, which you can find in the initial menu of the game or by pressing “Esc” on the PC, or the menu or start button on controllers. Select “Shift” on the list of options to open a new window where you can see your Shift account, friends, support, and rewards. Go to the rewards tab and enter the code.

If you want to use a new Shift code but don't want to boot your game up, don't worry. You can also redeem Borderlands 4 shift codes on the Shift official website. If this is your first time using this method, then you will need to set up a Shift account and link it to your account on the platform you're playing the game on. The Shift code can be redeemed in the “reward” tab on the left menu on the official site. If the code is valid, you will find your rewards in your inventory. In case the Shift code gives a Golden Key, you can see it in the "backpack" tab in your inventory listed alongside the other currencies you have in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
