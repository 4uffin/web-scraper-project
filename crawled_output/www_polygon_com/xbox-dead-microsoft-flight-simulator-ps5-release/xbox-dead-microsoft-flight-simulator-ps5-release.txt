Over the last few years, I've watched gamers try to predict the death of Xbox like radical Christians warning the world of the rapture. I've never bought into the doomsaying. Microsoft's gaming strategy was surely shifting as it locked into a subscription service strategy with Game Pass, but Xbox felt like it was still here to stay. Even when the company began flirting with porting its first-party games to competing consoles, I still just saw it as a modern strategy built to get the most money possible out of its most expensive productions or to find greater audiences for niche games like Pentiment. After the Sept. 25 PlayStation State of Play, I have joined the choir of fearmongerers. There is no greater sign of Xbox's demise than Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 coming to PlayStation 5. The end is nigh. Hold your Needler close and wait for the red ring to consume the world you once knew. Xbox games coming to PS5 isn't new at this point. Several tentpole Xbox exclusive games, like Forza Horizon 5, have made their way to PS5 by now to great success, and even Gears of War: Reloaded just launched simultaneously on Sony's console alongside Xbox. But something feels different about Microsoft Flight Simulator's move to PS5. Maybe it's just that Microsoft is actually in the name; it would be like PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale coming to Xbox. (Side note: I wouldn't be mad about that and in fact welcome the possibility.) It's the one thing that felt sacred as an exclusive, Microsoft's own jet-powered Sonic the Hedgehog.
But it's less the name and more so that Microsoft's long-running series feels like its sole purpose was to showcase Microsoft products. It isn't so much a game these days as it is a tech showpiece. It's the ace in the hole that's supposed to show us why the Xbox Series X is the most powerful console around. What else could run a Windows PC game so high end that you'll need to get a new graphics card from the future to run it? If Microsoft is ready to concede that even this showpiece will be just fine on PS5, consider the towel thrown in. That shouldn't come as much of a surprise at this point. It's just the latest in a long string of signs that suggest Microsoft is changing its approach to gaming hardware. We saw a tease of that early this year when it let Meta borrow the Xbox branding to create a special edition Meta Quest 3, a firm sign that Microsoft has no interest in making its own hardware to rival the PlayStation VR2. More recently, we got a sense of this when Microsoft's long-rumored handheld console came to fruition in the form of the ROG Xbox Ally. Rather than making its own handheld, Microsoft instead decided to delegate the task to Asus in more of a branded collaboration. The ROG Xbox Ally X is still custom-built to look and feel like an Xbox product, but it's your average portable PC at its core that's capable of playing games from any PC launcher. The more we see products like this pop up, the more the idea of a brand-new Xbox generation in a few years feels like its off the table. (A 2023 leak tied to Microsoft's battle with the FTC revealed new hardware in the works, including a mid-generation Series X refresh that has yet to come to fruition.) Maybe I'm overreacting to what's ultimately a non-story. Maybe it's just smart business at this rate to let Microsoft Flight Simulator — a niche series, even if it bears the company's name — fly free and benefit from the power of the PS5 Pro. There's no rule that says Xbox can't keep making consoles now, shifting its sales pitch to the fact that it's the best way to tie into the lifestyle it has created. One can make the case that it would still be a smart investment if you want to play your Xbox games consistently across PC, smart TVs, third-party handhelds, and more. Sony ports would live in isolation by comparison, missing out on the benefits of the broader ecosystem. But you have to admit that seeing Microsoft Flight Simulator on a State of Play stream feels like the type of end time sign that you'd see in the bible. After all, we do have a Gamer Saint these days.

Anyone anti-console wars should be in favor of Microsoft expanding where it publishes games. If you're pro console war, then I don't know what to tell you.

If you are anti console war than you should also be anti-GamePass. GamePass will become MS new console. I predict once MS has converted a significant chunk of the market into Gamepass users they will start releasing exclusives on the service. And it will be worse than a console since MS curates games for the service and not let the market decide the winners.

Smash Man They are already releasing exclusives on the service? Or did you mean purely on GP?tbb, with the strategy they have now, GP isn’t going anywhere near that real quick. They obviously need sales on other platforms. They are actualy moving away from exclusives

Regardless of console war affiliation... of the two, the PS5 is the console that gets the most games now.

It's not a matter of being in favor of console wars. That's silly. It's a matter of being wary of monopolies. Microsoft is clearly on track to exit the hardware business.It's not good for consumers to have Sony as the only remaining player in the high-end console space. (And that's not a dig at Nintendo. They're happily and successfully doing their own thing. They just aren't a direct Playstation competitor in the same way that XBox was.)

For me, the writing on the wall was years ago when Microsoft skipped Gamescom.I predicted at the time that they were just handing Europe over to Sony and that's exactly what happened.It hasn't really been much better. GamePass appears to be the final nail as retailers stop stocking Xbox products. See the latest news from Costco, WalMart and Target.

Yeah, I haven't bought an XBox since the XBone. Why even bother? No, seriously. I'm not a partisan in the console wars, I've had pretty much owned every major console since SNES/Genesis (no 3DO lawl), but I just saw no reason to own XBox hardware any more.FWIW I probably won't buy PS6 either, PS5 is not essential any more, I didn't need to buy it. And Switch 2 is not compelling. So... I guess it's all PC for me for the moment.

In much the same boat, the console offerings this gen have felt incredibly underwhelming, and while I enjoyed the Switch, I can't say I'm particularly onboard with a lot of Nintendo's recent nickel and dime pricing - I can wait that out a few years for the library to mature.I suppose it's not necessarily a bad thing, but it feels like the end of an era in a sense.

Well, the ONLY reason MS created Xbox was because they thought the console market would be easy money ... at that point in the late 1990's, they had the PC market wrapped up but unless they made and sold the software, they made no additional money while Nintendo and Sony* made $5-$15 for EVERY game sold even from third parties and Nintendo of course, made 100% from their own IP so MS thought if they made a WIN PC gaming box with no driver issues, they would make so much BUT typical MS arrogance and cluelessness making an XBox too big to fit in Japan & European homes and of course, selling US centric games and of course, WE"RE MICROSOFT, we can no wrong! You will bow before us! We'll just buy up as many gaming studios as possible! But what worked in 1989 for PC's did not work in 1999 and 2009. In 35 years, they made no inroads in 2/3 of the market but MS Enterprise throws off so much money - what's a $60 billion write off? But now, they realize they will always be third and sixth is you count WIN PC, the internet & IOS as competitors. *of course, Sony only got in to spite Nintendo so ...

How big do you think the original Xbox was that it couldn’t fit in Japanese and European homes? It was smaller and lighter than the PS5.It wasn’t too big but rather didn’t have the games the market was interested at the time, nor the business relationships to get them.

No. M$ joined the console war because (in the mid to late 90s) they were afraid if the playstation brand was successful, sony (which they bragged about considering) would infiltrate the operating system market. Thats M$ money maker. So as long as sony had competition in the console indusrty, it would prevent them from challenging M$ on their monopoly on operating systems. Apple and linux was tolerable.M$ knew they would be taking a loss creating consoles, but thats nothing compared to what they make selling Windows.
fast forward to today, they realize selling games as a service is a new market. And they are making billions on Gamepass subscriptions. Especially since everyone owns a windows desktop. So if they can penetrate the playstation market, they wouldnt need to sell consoles anymore.

I hope not. I haven't bought an Xbox since the 360 (even though that's my all-time favorite console), but that kind of competition is necessary for the industry to stay good and pro-consumer.

Agree, except for the part where Microsoft has bought tons of publishers/IP's (zenimax, bethesda, activision, blizzard) in the past decade therefore trying to make a monopoly to boost said subscriptions. Market consolidation is not good, whether its consoles, publishers, developers, etc.Steam seems to be the only positive from being in a monopoly side of things.

What's with the comment about cats living with dogs? As if that is something unusual? Obviously written by some who has not had cats and dogs together.

It's likely a joking reference to a famous line from Ghostbusters where they are describing a doomsday scenario: "“Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria!”

I think it's pretty obvious that the future of gaming is hardware agnostic, and cloud based. Xbox is far ahead in their infrastructure and investment into that inevitability. "Hardcore" console gaming will never grown beyond the same 150M people as long as there is a $500+ entry fee. In fact, we've seen the console market plateau (and shrink a little depending on who you ask) in the last two years.In the next decade, the idea of buying a $500+ box to play specific games will be as baffling as buying a DVD player to play movies from a specific studio.No one said that Netflix died when it left DVDs in the past, and thinking that Xbox is done because they are prioritizing digital distribution and box-less gaming is very near sighted.

As long as Xbox studios stays a power house, then I'm happy.
As a PC gamer Microsoft has done wonders compared to Sony.
All games being day 1 PC launches AND on gamepass?
Sign me up.
Sony over here still holding PC gamers hostage until they spend $400? $500? on an inferior product (still a great deal if you don't have a gaming pc).

Figures leave it to polygon do not be informed… Xbox came out in flat stated a long time ago that it wasn’t doing this mid gen refresh. And next GEN hardware is coming. It’s all been confirmed they’re doing it after that who knows but the next GEN console is coming. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
