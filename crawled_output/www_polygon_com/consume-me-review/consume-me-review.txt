Why do video games go through such great lengths to invent grand conflict when the mundane battles we face in everyday life contain higher stakes than any fictional war? Oh, you think fighting a flaming bone dragon is intense? Try getting through one day of high school as a teenage girl. You can’t parry unrealistic beauty standards, oh Tarnished one.
Rejecting the idea of gaming as a vessel for fantasy escapism, Consume Me makes players confront reality instead. The unclassifiable game, which won the prestigious Seamus McNally Grand Prize at this year’s Independent Games Festival, is a work of autobiography that finds co-developer Jenny Jiao Hsia adapting facets of her tumultuous teenage years into a complex life sim. What begins as a story about dieting culture soon turns into a high-stress juggling act of social expectations and mounting responsibilities. Inventive and unexpected, Consume Me is a misfit triumph that embraces life’s messy redirects and unresolved loose ends. Right from its opening content warning, which tells players that the game depicts an eating disorder, Consume Me’s focus seems clear cut. Jenny is a teenage girl living in New York City who becomes obsessed with losing weight. She adopts a stringent dieting routine to combat her growing insecurities, counting her “bites” every day ahead of a do-or-die weigh-in at the end of a given week. Drawing on the structure of Persona, Jenny has to choose how to spend her free time every day to balance her food intake with her energy level.

At first, my central concern is with crafting a meal each day that’s both filling and under par for Jenny’s daily goal. That involves packing food items of different shapes into a lunch box. If I can fill every required space with food, all while taking note of how many bites each piece adds to my daily total, I’m mostly golden. The danger comes when I eat too much, forcing me to burn off pounds by using my free time to exercise, or don’t eat enough, something that can trigger a snack attack that might force me to use up a precious cheat day when I swallow a bag of hot chips whole. It’s an unhealthy obsession for Jenny, but a manageable one from a gameplay perspective. I get a handle on the puzzle loop after a few tries and start to take pride in my ability to stick to a routine. It’s a false security; the more confident I get, the more I’m pulled into the allure of diet culture. Just as I am at my most hyperfocused, Consume Me begins its slow turn into a 50-car pile-up. Jenny’s focus becomes split between various responsibilities as her checklists of tasks that need to be completed in a given chapter get more demanding. She needs to do her weekly chores, like folding the laundry and cleaning the bathroom. She needs to keep her grades up by studying. Once she lands a boyfriend, she needs to make room for dates to keep her relationship health topped off alongside her energy and bite meters. Life rarely lets you focus on one thing for too long, and so Consume Me doesn’t either. Each new activity is playfully represented as a bite-sized minigame, whether I’m trying to match yoga poses with my wobbly limbs or fold my laundry by timing button presses just right. Hsia and co-developer AP Thomson are in a clear conversation with other slice of life games here, including Florence and Anna Anthropy’s autobiographical Dys4ia, but they also play with the design language of WarioWare to great effect. Nintendo’s wacko series serves as a perfect metaphor; Jenny’s life is a fast-paced microgame collection where she has no time to think as she’s pulled from one responsibility to the next. Every new development in her life puts something else on her plate, creating an effectively stressful balancing act that only gets more overwhelming with each chapter.
Ask yourself why so many stories about growing up feel the need to end in a big climax when real life is rarely so clean?
The life-sim systems powering all of this have the depth needed to support that mounting challenge. Every decision I make matters. If I do my makeup first thing in the morning, I can choose a perk for the day that will help me figure out the best activity to do later. Each outfit in my closet comes with a perk that can help me get the most out of a yoga session or a dog walk. I eventually get the option to stay up late to give myself extra actions in a day, but doing so will take a toll on my energy, which in turn could mess up my diet. Every choice tends to have a trade-off that will inevitably set Jenny back in one of her other goals. It’s always possible to ace every goal in a chapter, including any optional objectives, but Consume Me does a remarkable job at putting you in the mindset of a teenage girl stretched too thin by society’s expectations. Consume Me exists in a long tradition of girlhood literature, young adult coming-of-age films, and feminist indie games, but what makes it stand out is Hsia’s unique perspective on her experience. At every turn, she resists the urge to reduce fictional Jenny to a troubled kid in a heavy-handed cautionary tale that mines her pain for morals. We always see the story through the character’s eyes, with the entire game presented like you’re flipping through her notebook. Even when the undertones are pitch black, the world is still full of wit, bright colors, and playful doodles. She’s not hopeless, a lost cause destined to dramatically bottom out. Her eating disorder does not define her, nor does it other her; she’s a young person figuring it out like anyone else. It’s that philosophy that sends Consume Me into a refreshingly unexpected direction that trades structural cliché for honest self-reflection. Jenny’s relationship to food and her body doesn’t circle to the dramatic conclusion you’d expect. Instead, dieting fades into the background the longer the story goes on. She still has to stay under bite par each week to avoid a game over, but the stringent weigh-ins disappear as SAT deadlines demand her attention. Jenny changes. Her goals change, her fixations change, the nature of her disorder changes. She is not bound to a script that dictates where her life will go next even though she spends so much time wishing she could conform to one. If anything feels dramatically unsatisfying, ask yourself why so many stories about growing up feel the need to end in a big climax when real life is rarely so clean?

[Ed. note: Minor spoilers for Consume Me follow.] In its epilogue, Consume Me takes one last self-reflective turn. A montage details how the game came to be, including a scene where Hsia and Thomson discuss the ending we’ve just seen. Debating how it should all conclude, Thomson asks Hsia what happened in real life. She looks back at what happened to her on the fly, unpacking the natural ways that her development shifted over the years. There’s no symbolic turning point she can remember; it all just happened. When the credits finally do roll, we leave with a sense that Jenny still isn’t done growing. Her life will continue on in a series of scrap book memories. Every doodle, every photo, every angsty poem tells another piece of that ongoing story. Consume Me itself is a page in that book, but even that isn’t the ending. It’s just another checked box on a to-do list that isn’t meant to be completed. So long as you never stop wondering what more you can do tomorrow, you never stop coming of age. Consume Me will be released Sept. 25 on MacOS and Windows PC. The game was reviewed on Steam Deck using a prerelease download code provided by Hexecutable.
