For the second time in six months, Microsoft is raising prices on Xbox hardware in the United States. New prices on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles will go into effect on Oct. 3, the company announced Friday, "due to changes in the macroeconomic environment." Here's what it will cost to buy a new Xbox console, starting in October:
Xbox Series S 512 GB — $399.99 (was $379.99)
Xbox Series S 1TB — $449.99 (was $429.99)
Xbox Series X Digital — $599.99 (was $549.99)
Xbox Series X — $649.99 (was $599.99)
Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition — $799.99 (was $729.99)
The Xbox maker previously raised prices in May. Prior to that round of hikes, an Xbox Series X was $499.99, but that price will have jumped a whopping $150 by Oct. 3. The Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition has gone up by even more: It was $599.99 on April 30, and will be $200 more expensive this fall. In cold comfort, Microsoft says that pricing for Xbox controllers and headsets will remain the same, and that pricing in non-U.S. markets will remain the same. Microsoft's latest price increase comes one month after rival Sony announced a $50 across-the-board increase on PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. Nintendo made a similar move in August, raising the price of original Switch consoles and Joy-Con 2 controllers for Switch 2. With U.S. President Donald Trump's chaotic and punitive tariffs on goods manufactured in China, Vietnam, and India raising prices for companies (and being passed on to consumers), there's no telling if this is the last of the price fluctuations Americans will be forced to endure this year.

Get a grip. They've been greedy ever since this gen was released. They never truly lowered the price since Day 1.The older gens always dropped $100 within a year of release and then again the next year or 2.The only bed you made was continuing to support a failing gaming industry.

This is why I’ve told my friends who are in the fence about Switch 2 based on the price that they better just get one. We won’t see prices drop this generation. They will continue to rise

Kyle  It’s a simple fact, western wages are far higher than Chinese or Vietnamese wages. If you want manufacturing back in the US it’s either Americans working for peanuts or huge price rises. do you think the billionaire cult leader cares about his citizens wages?

Kyle This explains how you all end up as MAGA, no reading comprehension! Boop you on your little snoot, you rascal.A better question to ask is 'how do Republicans expect prices to go down if they kick out all the workers willing to work cheap?' No one thinks slave-wage immigration is a good thing, but American society depends on it and a lot of idiots somehow voted to make it a lot more expensive whilst... also making it cheaper? Without realising that's what they were doing?There are amoeba with more self-awareness.

I will never buy any Xbox products again. They discriminate against their customers they raise prices. they don’t let people sign into accounts unless they know their credit card information. This is an elitist business and they should no longer be supported. #CancelXbox

A lot of people showing they don't know how the economy works in this comment section. Anyone complaining about higher prices is calling Biden out, Trump still winning. We are Charlie Kirk.

"due to changes in the macroeconomic environment." Give me a break, just say the real reason…although I suppose it’s better than what we’ll be seeing in the future:“Thanks to President Trump’s immaculate foresight and unprecedented economic knowledge the Microsoft Corporation proudly announces that true patriots can now proudly pay $150 more for an Xbox X (anti woke version)! This patriotic surcharge is for the strength of our great nation and should not be a burden as we are the hottest nation ever and all Americans are experiencing uncharted prosperity! God Bless President Trump and God Bless the United States of America!”

That settles it. I won't buy Xbox/Microsoft products anymore. People can blame tariffs and Trump all they want, but Xbox is a multi-million dollar business.. It is nonsense they are going up this much on products that are the same as they were 5-7 years ago. I'm done, Microsoft. I won't give you another penny. This shows how much they care about their customers.

just remember folks, these companies are also not the good guy. to pass cost increases due to tariffs to the customer is a CHOICE that both companies that produce goods and retailers elect to do.
Its not a matter of course.
Its not a law of science. Both politicians and executives are failing the real people in this country.

Corporations aren’t anyone’s friend; however:1) XBox Series X was estimated to cost around $500 to manufacture in 2019.2) since then, inflation has increased costs 26% to ~$633; assuming some components have come down in price over last 6 years likely doesn’t cover the entire difference.3) now there is a 30% tax the importer must pay the government; that’s $822 if MS is still paying the same component prices; we do know they lose money on every purchase as-is so it can’t be too much lower.4) In late October, the government is currently planning to raise taxes on imports from China to 145%; that’s a $1,550 cost to MS to have the opportunity to stock and sell a console before retailer margin and other costs if getting these to consumers.And remember, this government seeks to call out and punish companies that adjust prices to compensate for tariffs. Sure seems like MS is still planning to eat a solid chunk of cash every time they sell a console after these price adjustments, and they’re probably desperately hoping the full 145% doesn’t actually happen. Pretty sure the US system of capitalism demands that companies make a profit in the market, so I don’t see how they have a realistic choice in this one instance.

They are choosing not to go out of business. Ideally, these companies would want to reduce the price, and
put the hardware in the hands of as many customers as possible, because the real money is in the games and subscription services. A couple of generations ago, prices would have halved by this point in the lifecycle, making it cheaper and accessible for a wider consumer base. This will slow down their ability to grow. No one with any sense wants this. Christmas will be interesting, given how many toys are manufactured overseas. But I guess Santa will be scapegoated in place of accepting reality.

I think many of us would agree with this but it IS an economic science. We were actually warned this would happen because it's a specific fact in world economics.Just because Microsoft is a US company does not mean they care about US politics like we do. They're playing the long game, and in their calculus they've decided they'll be just fine raising the prices of an Xbox.

I mean most consoles are already sold as loss leaders. I can't fault them here for passing on the costs. What I can fault them for is not labeling them as Trump tariffs.

Well the biden administration created the problems that forced the tariffs. PS also raised prices. There's more important things this govt is worried about than video games. It's an expensive hobby. Now a lil more so

This is comical. everything bad is secretly biden's fault? lmao Nothing forced the tariffs besides ego and ignorance and greed. And it's not just video games that are more expensive, you'll figure that out once you actually have to provide for yourself, pay your own bills, and put food on the table.

I'd take this article with a friend of salt, considering the prices they posted of new price and old price yet still try to say it went up close to 200$more when with the information that has been given contradicting what they are saying

There's nothing contradictory here. Numbers went up twice, prices went up exactly as much as they're reporting. With this second price hike, it's close to $200 more **than it was 4 months ago** for the top model. So not compared to the previous price, but to the price 4 months back.

We don’t manufacture the parts here and the parts would be subject to tariffs. It would take years to get a plant up and running, which would be a waste when tariffs will likely be gone under the next administration.

This is not how manufacturing works. Yes we have the workforce, however we do not have the raw materials or supply chain to make this a reality and wouldn't for a decade or more even if we wanted to. I used to work in a semiconductor fab, and it took nearly 7 years to get it up and running at full capacity.

lastalliance Not to mention it would be even more expensive. 'Scraps' in the US is still more than 'scraps' in Asia.

ViciousMoth , wrong. A billionaire corporation can get a plant up in short order. Don't make excuses for corporate greed.
