Disney is raising prices on its Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Select services and bundles in October, just days after subscribers reported canceling their subscriptions in protest over the company's handling of Jimmy Kimmel Live! under pressure from the U.S. government. The following price changes are slated to go into effect in the U.S. beginning Oct. 21, as revealed on Disney's support website:
Disney Plus (with ads) - $11.99 monthly (was $9.99)
Disney Plus Premium (no ads) - $18.99 monthly (was $15.99), $189.99 annually (was $159.99)
Disney Plus, Hulu Bundle (with ads) - $12.99 monthly (was $10.99)
Disney Plus, Hulu Premium Bundle (no ads) - $19.99 monthly (no change)
Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle (with ads) - $19.99 monthly (was $16.99)
Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Premium Bundle - $29.99 monthly (was $26.99)
Disney Plus Premium, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle Legacy - $24.99 monthly (was $21.99)
Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max Bundle (with ads) - $19.99 monthly (was $16.99)
Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max Bundle (no ads) - $32.99 monthly (was $29.99)
Additionally, prices for Hulu with Live TV (bundles that include Disney Plus and ESPN Select) are also going up:
Hulu + Live TV (with SVOD ads) with Disney Plus and ESPN Select - $89.99 monthly (was $82.99)
Hulu + Live TV (no SVOD ads) with Disney Plus Premium and ESPN Select - $99.99 monthly (was $95.99)
October's price hike on Disney Plus will be the company's third in three years. Disney Plus originally launched in 2020 for $69.99 per year or $6.99 per month. The most recent price increase for Disney Plus came in October 2024. Disney's latest price hike for its homegrown streaming service comes after reports that some of its customers were canceling Disney Plus in reaction to the suspension of late night host Jimmy Kimmel's show. On Sept. 17, Disney, which owns ABC, announced that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be pulled from the air indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel referred to “the MAGA gang” and mocked Donald Trump in relation to the suspected shooter of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. Critics framed the decision as corporate capitulation to pressure from FCC chair Brendan Carr and the Trump administration. Backlash was swift, ranging from calls to reverse the move to organized boycotts in response to Disney’s prolonged silence. Disney announced Monday that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would return on Tuesday, though some ABC affiliates owned by companies Nexstar and Sinclair say they will not broadcast the show.

Love to pop in a DVD, discover that the disc doesn't actually work anymore (forcing me to watch three random episodes of whatever season on Vimeo), and then discover that the show is no longer in print or is only available as a complete boxset when I only need to replace one disc

wonder what it would take for people to take Disney’s many many transgressions seriously.
