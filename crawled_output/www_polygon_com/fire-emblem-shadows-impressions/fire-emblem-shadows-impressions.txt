It’s not like Nintendo to surprise release a franchise game with little fanfare, unless it's meant to be a big moment in a Nintendo Direct. So when the company revealed the existence of Fire Emblem Shadows on Wednesday night, and announced it was already out on iOS and Android, fans were understandably puzzled. After all, Fire Emblem Heroes is an incredibly successful mobile game for Nintendo, so you’d think that the launch of a new game would warrant a red-carpet rollout. After spending a few hours with Fire Emblem Shadows, I can understand why it didn’t get that treatment. It is the most baffling video game I have experienced this year – and that’s coming from someone who played the entirety of Mindseye. Purely on paper, the idea of Shadows sounds strange, but immediately appealing. It takes Fire Emblem’s grid-based battles and adds a social deduction element, likely inspired by Among Us. The idea is that a team of players match up online and work together to clear a grid of enemies. The twist is that one person on the team is a saboteur whose goal is to screw their comrades over while still maintaining their innocence. It’s an unusual idea for a tactics game, but I was down to see something experimental instead of a direct follow-up to Heroes. I am now paying the price for that curiosity.

The first detail to note is that this is not a turn-based tactics game. While there are still characters on a familiar grid and Fire Emblem’s usual weapon wheel, it’s an auto-battler. Characters move automatically, attacking enemies on the board without your input. The player’s job is to drag additional spells onto the board, healing allies, attacking enemies, or performing movement tactics. It’s all dull, but I’m not opposed to that idea in a vacuum. A hands-off tactics game that’s more about cooldown management is a perfectly fine concept for a multiplayer mobile game with short matches that end in a matter of minutes. It’s Shadows’ spin on social deduction that feels so bizarre. Each game is split up into two rounds. In the first, your team simply has to fight a wave of monsters. It doesn’t really matter if you win or lose that fight; it only exists as a way to study your teammates’ behavior. Did someone attack their teammate? Did they refuse to heal anyone? When either your team or the CPU monsters are dead, you are tossed into a vote where each player decides who is actually an evil Shadow. The second round is then an asymmetrical clash where the two players fight the Shadow, who can use dark magic to spawn additional minions. You can probably already see the problem coming if you’ve been doing the math. There are only three players on a team. You are one of those players. So when you go to make your vote, you have a 50 percent chance of guessing right every time. You often won’t even need to take a wild guess, though. If one teammate has been killed by a stray magic spell during a battle, and you know it wasn’t you, you probably have a good idea of who did it. Rounds are too short to really build any sort of relationship with teammates or study a pattern of behavior. With no way to communicate with other players, either via voice chat or even in-game emotes, the social aspect of the game is laughably thin.

The longer I played, the more I found where depth is meant to exist. As a Shadow, you can do a bit of clever deception. You could choose to heal your companions once in a while in the fight, which they will see, while also damaging them with secret attacks that are invisible to them. You can kill yourself and fire spells from the grave, convincing each remaining player that the other is the imposter. Simply killing both teammates isn’t really a winning strategy because players who guess the villain correctly will get to revive from death once during the second fight. Ensuring they can’t come back just makes that final fight easier. Great! But none of it actually matters. Fire Emblem Shadows is as pay-to-win as mobile games get. Using currencies you obtain through play, you are able to level up each of your heroes and buy more powerful weapons. So long as you head into a round with stronger spells and weapons than your teammates, you are likely to win. Of course, you can expedite some of the RPG growth by spending real money on Gems. When I don’t have enough resources to get Alberta to Level 5, I’m told I can make up the difference by buying Gems, directing me to the shop. Orb packs are available for as little as 79 cents and as high as $78. There’s a similar wall on Shadows’ Season Pass, which includes both a free and Premium tier. Even on the free pass, I don’t just naturally unlock new rewards by leveling up. I need to complete daily and weekly challenges to access new reward tiers that grant me currency, spells, and characters. I can skip that part, though, by spending (you guessed it!) Gems to get to the next reward rank faster. The more money you sink in, the more you can skip the grind, buff your character, and clean house in online matches whether you win the social deduction round or not. It’s entirely irrelevant. What’s the reward for winning multiplayer rounds, anyways? Aside from more currency, you unlock new story chapters. Those are very basic, but perfectly fine visual novel story segments that build out the story behind both the light and dark characters. Winning also earns you rapport, a currency that unlocks social conversations with your heroes. In the first one I unlocked, my hero Alberta told me her name in a single dialogue panel. Each character’s Shadow version also gets their own unlockable support conversations. In the first one I unlocked, the evil Alberta told me her name in a single dialogue panel, adding that she liked to maul people. Riveting.

I really wanted to give Fire Emblem Shadows a fair shake, tinkering with my spells and trying new deception tactics in battles, but I can not wrap my brain around the design of it all. The fundamentals are so transparently flawed that it feels like a prank. Maybe it would work with another round? Or more players? But the dominating microtransaction layer makes it clear that the social deduction doesn’t really matter at all. All that matters is that you spend money powering up your furry heroes. (Yes, the lineup of launch characters is composed of cat-eared women and rhino-horned men rather than familiar faces from elsewhere in the series. No shade meant there; have fun, y’all.) As I tried to wrap my head around it all, I went to social media to try and find players who were digging it to understand the appeal. One of the only early supporters I could find on Bluesky was what appeared to be a pornbot account that was enthusiastically responding to posts about it, saying how glad it was that people are finally giving Fire Emblem Shadows — a game that had just come out hours ago — the second chance it deserved. I guess that’s the intended audience for this one.

Ugh I hate seeing the good Fire Emblem name attached to this trash. The art style looks horrendous and nothing like any actual game in the series. At least Heroes looks and plays like a watered-down version of an actual Fire Emblem game.

I watched a bit of the trailer on the Nintendo app and couldn’t get past the character designs or the unbelievably melodramatic narrator. Definitely not for me, but a bummer that it seems like it’s half baked too.
