The "Silver Bells" quest in Hollow Knight: Silksong is one of the game's more confusing side missions, and it's little wonder the person asking Hornet for help can't find their bells. You can only find them in two small areas, and Silksong makes no guarantees you'll get any when you start searching. If you need some extra currency, though, it's worth the hassle. Below, we break down how to complete Silksong's "Silver Bells" quest and what you get for your trouble. If you need more help navigating Pharloom, check out our Silksong interactive map.

You can pick up the "Silver Bells" quest from Bellhart's wish board, but only after completing "The Threadspun Town." That means you'll need to defeat Sister Splinter in Shellwood, get the wall cling ability, and venture through Bellhart's tunnels to challenge and defeat Widow. The quest reward isn't game-changing, though, so there's no rush to clear all this just to get to "Silver Bells." Take your time, and get to it when you're ready. Once Bellhart is up and running again, you'll see the board left of the bench, next to the town shop, is uncovered and has wishes for the taking. "Silver Bells" is one of them, so grab it off the board to get started.

For this wish, the Bellhart shopkeep needs you to find eight silver bells. These bells are only located in Bellhart's northern tunnels (which you went through to find Widow) and southern tunnels (which you can access through a secret path to the right of the Bellway calling station, then by wall jumping along a path above the Bell Hermit). The catch is that their appearance is entirely random. You might go through the entire southern tunnel network and find nothing or venture through the northern passages and end up with three bells in one go. On the bright side, the Silver Bells are large, silver (of course), and have a glowing white aura like other Silksong collectibles, so when you do come across them, they're hard to miss. Most of them will just be sitting on the ground, though we did have one instance where a Silver Bell fell out of the roof in a manner similar to the bell monsters that appear in the same way. The areas "reset" when you exit to another region or rest on a bench. The southern tunnels are larger and have more areas to search, but the faster option is to keep rushing through the northern tunnels, exit via the bottom left into Shellwood, and then return and do it all again. It took us five trips through both tunnels (so, 10 total) to get the necessary eight Silver Bells, though since bell appearances are random, it may take you fewer or more trips.

For all that diligent bell collecting, you get 120 rosary beads when you report back to the shopkeep in Bellhart. It may not seem like a lot, but depending on how many beads you have at the time, it's a big step toward being able to purchase the memory locket from Bellhart's shop, which expands how many tools you can use on whichever crest you apply the locket to. If you don't plan on spending the beads immediately, consider purchasing a rosary bead string from the shop. These hold 120 beads and remain in your inventory even if you die. Looking for more Silksong help? Check out our essential beginner tips and top rosary bead farming locations if you're just getting started, and if you're running up against a few locked doors, our simple key locations guide is the one for you. While you're exploring and completing quests like the "Rite of the Pollip" wish, make sure to spend some time progressing the main story as well, as you'll get some upgrades that make battles easier. After "The Threadspun Town" quest, for instance, you can upgrade your needle to deal more damage.
