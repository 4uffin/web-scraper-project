Pokémon Go's new season, "Tales of Transformation," will run until Dec. 2, alongside a set of special research with the same name that rewards you with Keldeo. As it usually goes with these types of seasonal research tasks, there are only a few steps available now, with the rest rolling out as the season progresses. By the end of the season, you'll be able to turn Keldeo into its Resolute Form for the first time in the game. This research will only be available to claim during this season, so make sure to open the game and start it before Dec. 2. Once you start the research, you'll have an unlimited amount of time to complete it. Below, we list the steps for Pokémon Go's "Tales of Transformation" Keldeo Special Research.
