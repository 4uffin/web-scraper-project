Pokémon Go's new season, "Tales of Transformation," will run until Dec. 2, alongside a set of special research with the same name that rewards you with Keldeo. As it usually goes with these types of seasonal research tasks, there are only a few steps available now, with the rest rolling out as the season progresses. By the end of the season, you'll be able to turn Keldeo into its Resolute Form for the first time in the game. This research will only be available to claim during this season, so make sure to open the game and start it before Dec. 2. Once you start the research, you'll have an unlimited amount of time to complete it. Below, we list the steps for Pokémon Go's "Tales of Transformation" Keldeo Special Research.
'Tales of Transformation' step 1 of 8
Catch 25 water- or fighting-type Pokémon (15 Poké Balls)
Power up water- or fighting-type Pokémon 15 times (5 Revives)
Spin 10 PokéStops or gyms (1 Charged TM)
Rewards: Keldeo encounter, Keldeo T-Shirt cosmetic, 3 Keldeo Candy XL If you already have a Keldeo from the previous paid ticket, you will get 50 Keldeo Candy instead of the encounter.
'Tales of Transformation' step 2 of 8
Catch 30 Pokémon (2,500 Stardust)
Power up Pokémon 15 times (5 Super Potions)
Explore 5 km (2,500 XP)
Rewards: 25 Keldeo Candy, 647 XP, 647 Stardust
'Tales of Transformation' step 3 of 8
This step of the research isn't available yet. We'll update this guide once it's added.
