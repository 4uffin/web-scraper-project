Dual Pullmans means we're getting a big Kylo Ren goof, right?

Photo: Amazon MGM Studios
Production on Spaceballs 2 — apparently not the movie's official title — is now underway, Amazon MGM Studios announced Thursday, alongside a photo reveal of the cast and crew. And even Mel Brooks' Spaceballs sequel is using its table-read photo as a chance to poke fun at Star Wars, recreating the 2015 cast photo for The Force Awakens to confirm who's coming back and who's new to the Spaceballs family. Returning for Spaceballs 2 are Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet, Bill Pullman as Lone Starr, Daphne Zuniga as Vespa, George Wyner as (presumably) Colonel Sandurz, and Mel Brooks as Yogurt and Skroob. The 2027 Spaceballs sequel will be Moranis' first live-action movie project in 30 years. New to the cast are Lewis Pullman, Keke Palmer, Josh Gad, and Anthony Carrigan, all in unannounced roles. The younger Pullman is reportedly playing Starburst, son of Lone Starr and Vespa, while Palmer is playing a new character named Destiny. Gad sure seems like a good fit for a son-of-John-Candy's-Barf character — he is seated right next to a giant fire hydrant in the cast photo, after all. Beyond the cast, we also get a look at some of the people behind the film. That includes director Josh Greenbaum, who made the deliciously weird Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, and screenwriters Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez (Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem). Elsewhere in the photo, we get a peek at an Igloo cooler standing in for R2-D2, Brooks Zooming in via laptop, and a supreme pizza on a chair. (Could Baby Pizza the Hutt be a thing?) Whatever this all means is still a mystery, which Brooks and company are playing into. As noted in a news release, "While the title and plot details are being kept under wraps, the title is rumored to be the name of the movie, and plot details are being described as information about what happens in the story." Spaceballs 2 is slated for release sometime in 2027. In the meantime, you can revisit the Star Wars: The Force Awakens cast photo for comparison, and reflect on a simpler time before Star Wars sequel discourse melted our brains.

I have zero interest in seeing Josh Gad at all, especially as Barf Jr, but have read rumors that John Candys son has been tapped for a role, hopefully as his father's namesake
