Pokémon trainers have been putting in work in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's shiny Treasures of Ruin raids, and that work has paid off. All four shiny Legendarys are available to claim via a Mystery Gift, and you have one week left to snag them before they go extinct like Kabutops. Announced during the July Pokémon Presents, the five-star Tera Raids pitted trainers against shiny versions of Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu. They needed to be defeated 1 million times each to be made available via mystery gift. Players quickly flew past a million victories in the first raid, and never looked back. All four shinies were defeated at least 3.1 million times before their raids expired.

Players can snag their new shiny 'mons via Mystery Gift through the in-game Poké Portal. Pull up the X menu, select Poké Portal, then navigate to Mystery Gift. Select Get via Internet and choose which Pokémon to receive. Repeat the process until you have all four (and whatever other goodies may be available). Shiny Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu will be available via Mystery Gift until Tuesday, Sept. 30 at 7:59 p.m. EDT. They're available to snag whether you defeated them in the raids or not, so there's no reason not to claim 'em.
