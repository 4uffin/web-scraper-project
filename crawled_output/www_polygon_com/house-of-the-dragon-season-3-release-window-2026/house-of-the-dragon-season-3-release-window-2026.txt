HBO's Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon finally has a season 3 release date, following 2024's epic season 2, but the second installment won't come for another year. “I think it’ll be just outside of [the 2026 Emmy eligibility window],” Casey Bloys, Chairman and CEO, HBO and HBO Max Content, told Deadline. That means the upcoming season of House of the Dragon should debut no later than May 31, 2026, around the same time season 2 premiered in June 2024. House of the Dragon season 3 is going to be, to quote showrunner Ryan Condal, “goddamn massive.” He continued, “Every day I walk around there and look at the things that we're building and the things that we're doing and the number of costumes and extras and all that... I knew it was bigger than season 2, but I don't think I realized quite how much.” If you've forgotten just what went down in season 2, here's a little reminder: Daemon is firmly back with Rhaenyra, and together with their new dragon riders, they’re heading for King’s Landing to strike fast. Team Green, however, is in chaos — Alicent commits treason, Aegon hides with Larys, and Aemond burns everything in sight — as the rest of Westeros braces for war. The Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, initially set for a 2025 release, is now scheduled to premiere in January.

Season two in my opinion was somewhat of a disappointment compared to season one Ryan condal should let Miguel Sapochnik do more of the episodes like he did in the original Game of Thrones. last season it seemed like the whole show was involves around Damon Targaryen having a fever dream with Alice rivers at Harrenhall . They need to do better than that.. season one Patty Considine was fantastic and the show definitely got off on the right foot but season two definitely went sideways.
