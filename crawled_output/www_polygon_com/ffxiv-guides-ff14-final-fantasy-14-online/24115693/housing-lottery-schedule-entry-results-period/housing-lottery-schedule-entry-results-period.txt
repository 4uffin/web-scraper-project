FFXIV housing lottery schedule for September 2025
If you’re trying to get a house in Final Fantasy 14, you’ll need to play the lottery system. The FFXIV lottery system consists of five “entry period” days, followed by four “results period” days. You’ll need to place your bid during the entry period days and if you win, finalize your purchase during the results period days. (If you don’t claim your win during the results period, you will forfeit the plot and lose 50% of your deposit. Yikes!) You can also check where the housing schedule is in game by opening your Timers menu and selecting the housing tab. If you’re trying to plan ahead, we list out the FFXIV housing schedule for September 2025 below. Note that our schedule does not take any maintenance times into account, so you may need to bid or claim your houses a day or so earlier to accommodate for this.
