Marvel’s Wolverine resurfaced at Wednesday’s PlayStation State of Play stream, and in a big way — Sony revealed a fall 2026 release window alongside a new trailer showcasing just how violent we can expect Insomniac’s next Marvel endeavor to be. "I'm not a violent man," Wolverine says in a voice-over, just before he ruthlessly slices through and stabs several enemies throughout the trailer. Omega Red makes an appearance, teasing what will surely be a vicious boss fight, as well as the shape-changing Mystique.
Marvel’s Wolverine was announced four years ago in September 2021. The announcement trailer showcased Logan in a run-down bar in Madripoor (presumably the game’s setting), and Easter eggs like “HLK 181” on a license plate — a reference to the Marvel comic in which Wolverine made his first full appearance, The Incredible Hulk #181. Since that initial reveal in 2021, we haven’t heard any further official word on the game until now. Unfortunately, as part of the December 2023 ransomware hack against Insomniac, assets from the game leaked online, alongside sensitive employee data. "The best there is at what he does" has appeared in recent team-up games, like Marvel’s Ultimate Alliance 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns. Insomniac’s Wolverine will be the mutant’s first solo outing since 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which was actually pretty good despite it's links to a terrible movie.
Insomniac is well-versed at crafting compelling games starring Marvel characters at this point; Wolverine will be released after the studio has launched three acclaimed Spider-Man games (and hopefully a fourth is on the way). Marvel's Wolverine will release on PlayStation 5 in fall 2026.

Up next is Venom and Spider-Man 3. Then the long wait for X-Men. Insomniac has settled itself as the Marvel go-to game studio. I hope Marvel gives them the time and budget to develop great titles and maybe even help push lesser known names.

Honestly, this is the least exciting thing that could happen. The best Marvel game of the last decade was Midnight Suns, and it did push lesser known names! Now I expect every big budget game to be a Spider-Man style open world action-adventure.
