FromSoftware is adding a new layer of difficulty for hardcore Elden Ring Nightreign players. After giving each of the game's Nightlord bosses a more challenging Everdark Sovereign remix, the developer is extending the challenge to expeditions themselves, with a new high-difficulty mode called Deep of Night that will test players' skills. Deep of Night mode will feature enemies that are stronger than usual throughout Limveld. And players won't be able to specify which Nightlord they're actually going to face in Deep of Night. Nor will they get the potential benefits of Shifting Earth locations. It all sounds pretty punishing (but a nice change of pace, since expeditions are largely a breeze for most seasoned Elden Ring Nightreign players at this stage). So what do players get for their troubles? New Depths Relics that are exclusive to Deep of Night mode. They'll also find weapons that have additional effects not seen in the standard expeditions in Nightreign — some of them detrimental, according to an announcement from publisher Bandai Namco. The publisher says that Deep of Night difficulty will increase "the deeper you descend." It's not clear exactly how this new layered structure will work just yet — "ratings will fluctuate based on wins and losses, affecting the 'depth,'" they say — but it sounds like Depth 3 is a big challenge. Depths 4 and 4 promise "an endless battle for those seeking even greater thrills." The getting good is just getting started. Elden Ring Nightreign's new difficulty mode arrives on Sept. 11.

I personally feel like Fromsoft should have given the gaming industry more of a heads up before dropping this bombshell on us.

Wait so this update just makes the game darker? I don’t get why folks would pay for that… I can just change the brightness. No need to pay for dark night mode
