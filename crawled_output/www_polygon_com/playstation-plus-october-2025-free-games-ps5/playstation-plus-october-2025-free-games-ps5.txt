During Wednesday's State of Play, Sony Interactive Entertainment revealed October 2025's free Essential games for PlayStation Plus. Alan Wake 2, Cocoon, and Goat Simulator 3 will arrive on the service on Oct. 7 for all subscribers. The horror adventure Alan Wake 2 was a Game of the Year nominee in 2023. It followed up on the titular character's story from 2010's Alan Wake while introducing a new playable character, FBI Special Agent Saga Anderson. It's part of Remedy Entertainment's shared universe, something its DLC expansion explored in depth. Meanwhile, Annapurna's 2023 puzzler Cocoon remains one of the genre's most memorable games. Its puzzles treat various worlds like Matryoshka dolls, and we described it as "a complete game â€” one that sees through every permutation of its conceit." It's also one of our favorite games on Game Pass. Goat Simulator 3 is a comedic party game. It's wildly absurd, and has you playing as a mischevious goat drumming up chaos.
PlayStation Plus comes in three tiers. Essential is the entry level for Sonyâ€™s subscription game service, and it offers online multiplayer access, a monthly assortment of free PS4 and PS5 games, cloud storage, and discounts on PlayStation Store purchases. PlayStation Plus Essential costs $79.99 annually, $24.99 for a three-month subscription, or $9.99 monthly. Also announced was that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will join the game catalog for Extra and Premium members on Sept. 26, which is when Naughty Dog and Sony celebrate The Last of Us Day. The classics catalog for Premium members will also add Tekken 3, Soul Caliber 3, and Tomb Raider Anniversary some time later this year.

While I always recommend the first Alan Wake as a work of art, it's not entirely necessary to play Alan Wake 2, which evolves the formula in surprising and awesome ways.
