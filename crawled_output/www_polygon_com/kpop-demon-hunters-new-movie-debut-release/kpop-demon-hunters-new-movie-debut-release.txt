2025 is, without a doubt, the year of KPop Demon Hunters. The animated singing sensation has brought win after win for Netflix, and it doesn't look like Rumi, Zoey, and Mira's adventures as the KPop group HUNTR/X will be stopping anytime soon. A new short film has been rated and is, reportedly, ready for release. A PG-rated animated short film named DEBUT: A KPOP Demon Hunters Story was filed today by the MPA Classification and Rating Administration. Its distributor, Sony Pictures Animation, was also listed. The film is listed to have been rated PG for some action/violence, as well as scary images. Those who have watched KPop Demon Hunters can piece together that, once more, we'll be seeing some level of demon slaying. The release date of the short film was not revealed, but what we can speculate from the title is that it may follow Rumi, Zoey, and Mira's debut, both into the world of the KPop entertainment industry and as demon hunters, whose lives are dedicated to driving demons away from humanity and restoring the Honmoon, the protective barrier around the world.

Alternatively, the film could also be about the previous generations of demon hunters. As established in KPop Demon Hunters, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira are but the latest batch of hunters and idols that have taken up the mantle of demon slaying. However, considering the overwhelming popularity of HUNTR/X, we speculate that it's more likely we'll be getting an origin story for the three. While we expected the franchise to make an official announcement of a sequel, we won't say no to a little taster. Considering how immensely popular the soundtrack continues to be, we also wouldn't be surprised if the short film comes with a brand-new song alongside it. After all, it would feel like quite the victory to beat out Golden. Until the short is released, however, KPop Demon Hunters fans will have to wait (and speculate) a little longer.

Didnâ€™t they seal the Golden Honmoon in the movie? Kinda seals the deal on it being a sequel, no?

Huntrix didn't seal the golden honmoon, they let it dissolve to build a new one. And with with that working title it sounds a lot more like a prequel, or a story about different hunters all together.

I think the article is saying that a sequel is expected, but in the interim they are releasing this short prequel.
