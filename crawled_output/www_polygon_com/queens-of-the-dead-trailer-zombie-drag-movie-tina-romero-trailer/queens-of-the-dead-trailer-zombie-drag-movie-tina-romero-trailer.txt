A new horror comedy featuring zombies and drag queens is on the way. Queens of the Dead releases in theaters this October, and the first trailer just arrived. The movie was directed by Tina Romero (daughter of zombie cinema icon George A. Romero), who has previously worked on TV and short films. This is Romero's feature directorial debut. Queens of the Dead is Romero's feature directorial debut, and follows a group of wild, wonderful, and wacky drag queens, club kids, and everything else in between after a zombie apocalypse breaks out during their giant warehouse party. Knowing they can't rely on anyone but each other, the group must put aside their differences and come together to fight against the brain-chomping undead. That is, if they don't kill each other first. The trailer shows off recognizable names, such as Katy O'Brian (Loves Lies Bleeding, Twisters), Jaquel Spivey (Mean Girls), Tomas Matos (Fire Island), Nina West (RuPaul's Drag Race), Jack Haven (I Saw the TV Glow), Cheyenne Jackson (American Horror Story), Dominique Jackson (Pose) and Margaret Cho (It's My Party.) With a strong cast and delightful premise, we expect to see some truly stellar acting, lots of gore, and plenty of laughs among the jump scares. The film first premiered at the Tribeca Festival this year, where it won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature. High praise. We always have more time for queer, campy horror in our lives. From what we can tell from the trailer, it looks like Queens of the Dead will do three things: slay in more ways than one, have plenty of bite, and keep you gagging for more. Independent Film Company and Shudder will release Queens of the Dead in theaters on Oct. 24.
