Popping between dimensions is a staple of the superhero genre, dating all the way back to the 1961 comic The Flash #123. The multiverse, as its known today, allows characters to explore alternate realities with small (or massive) differences from their own, typically learning something about themselves along the way. That seems to be the premise of Peacemaker season 2, in which our anti-hero Chris Smith (John Cena) discovers an alternate Earth where his father Auggie (Robert Patrick) and brother Keith (David Denman) are both still alive. Better yet, the three of them form a popular superhero team called the "Top Trio." Oh, and in this dimension, Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) is also in love with Chris. As Peacemaker puts it: "best dimension ever!" After Chris accidentally kills the version of himself from that dimension, he takes his place and begins to explore what seems like a much better version of his own life; one in which adoring fans cheer as he drives his motorcycle down the street. So it doesn't come as a huge surprise when, at the end of episode 5, a disillusioned Peacemaker heads back to that alternate dimension and closes the portal behind him. What could go wrong? If one popular fan theory proves to be correct, a lot could go wrong.

If you've been paying attention during those alternate dimension scenes, you have noticed a few things about this "best dimension ever." For one thing, everyone is white. There's zero diversity in this universe, even the background extras are all white. Eagle-eyed fans have also spotted that every time we see an America flag in that dimension, it's carefully positioned to hide the stars, suggesting something else may have replaced them. Oh yeah, and wasn't Auggie a raging racist before he died? Seems weird that in this universe he's a beloved superhero. Maybe those freedom fighters/terrorists Chris murdered earlier this season were actually onto something... Based on all these clues, the popular consensus seems to be that the "best dimension ever" is actually Earth-X, an alternate universe in the DC Comics where Nazi Germany won World War II and conquered the world, including America. Earth-X was first introduced in 1973's Justice League of America #107 and factored into the popular crossover story Crisis on Infinite Earths (both the comic book version and the live-action Arrowverse adaptation).
Whether Peacemaker showrunner James Gunn decided to revisit the Earth-X plotline or try something new remains to be seen. However, with episode 5 ending on a huge cliffhanger, we have a feeling we'll find out what's really up with this dimension pretty soon. The question is: If Chris learns that getting everything he ever wanted means supporting upholding Nazi rule, will he just roll with it? That may be a step too far, even for a guy who's top priority has always been peace by any means necessary.

A less common theory, that actually makes a little more sense, is that Gunn will not have in this universe Nazis winning WW2, but the Confederacy winning the Civil War (which would have helped the Nazis conquering Europe decades later).

Oh, I really like that. I've been calling NaziVerse since Day 1, but this honestly feels more on point.The problem with going all Man In The High Castle is that it exoticizes the hatred, in a way? It would mean everyone in that universe is racist because they're a product of a Nazi-controlled society, not because the inherent racism in the founding of America itself just rolled on without interruption.The level of patriotism on display in the coloring of the Top Trio also dips into an Americanism that probably wouldn't exist under Nazi rule, right? Now, a fully White Supremacist America moving to ensure other like-minded Empires succeeded across history would make sense, and still allow for some horrific worldbuilding. (I agree with your take that Europe would be All Nazis. And then I guess a fully Japanese Asia? Or maybe the Nazis overtake all the commonwealth countries too, and scoop up India and Africa?)GI Robot's backstory was the appetizer. And again, Chris' Dad's brand of racism was All American. This makes total sense, and I'm really terrified about what it'll mean.
