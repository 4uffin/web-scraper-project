Knowing the Max Battle schedule is useful if you’re looking to expand your inventory of Dynamax Pokémon in Pokémon Go. It does appear that Niantic will start rotating Pokémon in and out of Max Battles on a month-by-month basis, with some event Pokémon littered in. There are also Max Mondays, a weekly event similar to raid hour, where one Pokémon will show up more frequently in power spots from 6-7 p.m. That said, you’ll want a healthy amount of Dynamax Pokémon in your team if you choose to divulge in the feature, as only Dynamax Pokémon can participate in Max Raids. (So you’re pretty much catching Pokémon to help you catch more Pokémon.) Notably, if you’re just starting out with Max Battles, you should have a “To the Max!” Special Research set that starts you off with a Dynamax Wooloo. Below, we list the Max Monday line-up and other upcoming events that will focus on Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon in Pokémon Go.
Pokémon Go Max Monday line up for September 2025
These Pokémon will show up in power spots abundantly on specific Mondays, from 6-7 p.m. in your local time (similarly to a raid hour):
Sept. 1: Pidove*
Sept. 8: Trubbish*
Sept. 15: Abra*
Sept. 22: Chansey*
Sept. 29: Beldum*
*Shiny version available
Pokémon Go Max Battle events for September 2025
There aren't any Gigantamax Raid Days or Max Battle Days on the calendar provided by Niantic for September. However, there will be a Steel Skyline event that begins on Sept. 30 that would be a good place to debut Duraludon and Dynamax Duraludon, which were teased in trailers for the season, so you may want to keep your eyes out for that. If you’re wondering about other activities this month, see the Spotlight Hour schedule or the raid schedule.
