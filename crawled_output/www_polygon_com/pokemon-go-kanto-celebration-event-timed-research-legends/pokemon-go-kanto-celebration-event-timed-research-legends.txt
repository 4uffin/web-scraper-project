Pokémon Go is throwing a "Kanto Celebration" event from Sept. 2-7, bringing back the Kanto region Pokémon yet again. This event has quite a few perks, like tripled Mega Evolution duration, one guaranteed Candy XL for evolving Pokémon, doubled XP from PokéStops, and special photobombs from the three Kanto starter Pokémon. The Kanto starters will also learn their respective legacy moves (Frenzy Plant for Venusaur, Blast Burn for Charizard, and Hydro Cannon for Blastoise), so make sure to take advantage of this to get some really strong Pokémon, if you don't already have these moves on your Kanto starters. This event also does get the XP perks from the ongoing "XP Celebration" event as well. Below, we list all the other perks for the Pokémon Go "Kanto Celebration" event, including the Timed Research, premium Special Research, spawns, and more.
