Just 70 days after its theatrical debut, James Gunn and David Corenswet’s Superman is officially landing on HBO Max this week. Corenswet confirmed the news on Instagram with a selfie of his TV showing the film on the streamer’s homepage, playfully tagging co-star Sara Sampaio with a nod to her character Eve Teschmacher, while Gunn amplified the announcement on X, revealing the movie arrives Friday, Sept. 19. Warner Bros. confirmed the news soon afterward in an official press release, teasing a full DCU takeover of HBO Max to celebrate the streaming release.
To mark Superman’s homecoming, HBO Max is rolling out a special themed interface packed with interactive features. Fans will see Daily Planet–inspired homepage art, a Fortress of Solitude hub curating Superman-related content, and hidden portals across the homepage that transport users into Lex Luthor’s Pocket Dimension, where personalized title recommendations await. Superman smashed through several milestones this summer, including the biggest opening for a Man of Steel film ever, and even beating Barbie in joining the Two Million Watched Letterboxd club in just 45 days. Although some may be split on its depiction of Superman or even its ending, Superman has created a solid first step in DC's new universe, and Peacemaker season 2 serves as a good follow up. We already have confirmation of a Man of Tomorrow follow-up film starring Corenswet's Superman and Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor seemingly teaming up together against an even greater threat. (It's Braniac, right?) However, Gunn has already confirmed that it will be a standalone film and not Superman 2. Man of Tomorrow is set to start filming next year and release in theaters on July 9, 2027. In the meantime, you can watch Superman on HBO Max starting this Friday, Sept. 19.
