It's never been a better time to be a fan of The Witcher: a new season is coming up, Ciri is getting her own video game, and now, in an exclusive reveal from us at Polygon, we can confirm that Geralt's adventures are continuing in a brand-new series from Dark Horse Comics. Titled The Witcher: Blood Stone, the comic is a collaboration between CD PROJEKT RED and Dark Horse. The comic follows Geralt as he learns ancient dwarven mines have drawn the attention of treasure hunters — and local legend tells of a horned beast that's killing them. However, there's just one problem: There's no evidence of an attack. Having little other choice, Geralt investigates the area. Unfortunately, the mountains and its mines are treacherous, and, as Geralt discovers, sometimes it's best to leave what remains undisturbed. The four-issue miniseries is written by Daniel Freedman (Birdking, Kali), with letters by Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou (Kill All Immortals, The Witcher: The Bear and the Butterfly), colors by Roman Titov (Cyberpunk: 2077: Big City Dreams), and art by Pius Bak (Godfather of Hell, Slightly Exaggerated). The miniseries also includes main cover art from Bak, with variant covers fromGigi Cavenago (The Magic Order, Dylan Dog), concept artist and illustrator Axel Sauerwald, and illustrator and graphic designer, Patrycja Podkościelny.
"I am thrilled to leave my mark on the legendary long-running fantasy, The Witcher," Freedman said in an exclusive statement. “Geralt and I share a lot of the same sensibilities and getting to weave a blood-soaked tale about the true monster of man is always an opportunity I relish.” "Daniel Freedman has written one of the best dark fantasy comic books ever, Birdking," added Marcin Zwierzchowski, Editor, Writer, and Franchise Creative at CD PROJEKT RED. "So inviting him to tell his own story in the world of The Witcher felt like a perfect match. Together with Pius Bak and Roman Titov they formed a dream team that crafted a wonderful story about greed and wounds that do not heal." The first issue (of four) of The Witcher: Blood Stone arrives in comic shops on Jan. 28, 2026 for $4.99.
