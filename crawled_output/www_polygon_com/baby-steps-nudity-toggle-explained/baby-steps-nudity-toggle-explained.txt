Baby Steps, the latest game from the developers of Ape Out, is now available on PlayStation 5 and Windows PC. If you plan to give it a try (and you very much should), you’ll find yourself faced with a decision before you start playing. An opening screen informs you that the game features a fair bit of nudity and asks if you’d like to turn it off. Regardless of whether or not that’s a problem for you, I’m just here to do my job and let you know that it isn’t exaggerating: Yes, there is indeed a lot of full-frontal nudity in Baby Steps. More specifically, a lot of dick. And I really mean dick. We’re talking floppy hogs that swing around like tubes of salami hanging from the ceiling at a butcher shop. The kind of dong you could jump rope with. Big grandfather clock energy this way lies.

Some context is in order: Early on in Baby Steps, our wobbly-limbed hero, Nate, stops to rest at a campfire. When he wakes up, he is shocked to find a donkey man sitting with him at the campsite. He is also shocked to find that the man isn’t wearing pants and is letting that thang fly free like a flag on the Fourth of July. It’s a scene straight out of a 2000’s R-rated comedy, where Nate desperately tries to avoid staring at it despite the fact that it is at perfect eye level. That’s only the beginning. Nate encounters more donkey men throughout his adventure who beg him to help out with a world-saving task. Yes, they are all naked too. It is probably the most dick I’ve seen in a game since Genital Jousting, which was similarly published by Devolver Digital. I’m not telling you this to sway you away from playing Baby Steps, like a flaccid schlong blowing in the wind. Consider this more of a PSA for streamers deciding if they should take the nudity warning seriously, or parents who want to avoid an awkward moment with their kids when little Timmy walks in at the exact wrong moment. It’s just good to know what you’re getting into.

For most people, though, I’d recommend keeping the knob toggle on. Baby Steps doesn’t just toss uncensored phallus in for the sake of low-brow comedy; it’s integral to the story. Beneath all the slapstick pratfalls, Baby Steps is a game explicitly about masculinity. Nate, a failson teleported to a strange world, is on a journey to confront insecurities about his manhood that tower over him. Part of that revolves around his relationship to his body, which doesn’t match up with your typical vision of a macho video game hero. The donkeys — dicks and all — make those abstract insecurities tangible. The ideal male image taunts him at every step of his adventure, quite literally waggling it in his face. It’s played for laughs early on, but Baby Steps eventually weaves that into sincerity as Nate’s quest becomes one about proving that he is just as capable of surviving a hero’s journey in his own body. I, for one, love how committed Baby Steps is to letting it all hang out there. Media has no problem showing breasts, but there’s still a stigma around male nudity. It’s virtually something you never see outside of arthouse films or outsider indie games. And at a time when digital marketplaces are cracking down on adult games due to pressure from censorship campaigns, it feels more significant than ever for a mainstream indie to stand firm in its decision to normalize nudity as a storytelling tool. As firm as a … well, you know.
