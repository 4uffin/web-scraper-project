Vault Hunters enjoy the millions of guns and the type of chaos one can only find in Kairos, an experience that can get even better with a bit of help from our Borderlands 4 guide collection. From learning how to increase the quantity of ammo Rafa can carry to finding the solid source of legendary weapons for Vex — we’ve got you covered.
Learn the basics!
There are many tools and services to use in Borderlands 4, and they can save your life — and a lot of time — if you remember to use them. Call your vehicle whenever you can or use fast travel spots to quickly jump from one place to another, so you can quickly shred into the next group of Rippers. You should also never forget to spend your skill points. Don’t worry about picking the right one. You can always respec your character and make your Vault Hunter feel brand-new.
Get better guns
You want more guns to face the Timekeeper, and the stronger they are, the better. One way to acquire them is by completing side quests like the “Meat is Murder” in the first areas of the game. The “Waterstop Evocarium” is just one of the many challenges you can complete to earn SDU tokens. When you get to the endgame portion of Borderlands 4, you can look for legendary drops like the ones sold by Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine.
