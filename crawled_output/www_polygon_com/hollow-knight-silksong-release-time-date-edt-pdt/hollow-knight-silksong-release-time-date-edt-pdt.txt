Hollow Knight: Silksong release time in your time zone
What to expect from Hollow Knight: Silksong
Six years and one legendary hype cycle later, it's finally time for Hollow Knight: Silksong, the follow-up to Team Cherry's beloved 2017 Metroidvania. Yes, it's hard to believe we'll soon be living in a post-Silksong meme world, but if that's the price of being able to finally play this thing, so be it. Here's when Hollow Knight: Silksong releases in your time zone, plus some extra info about what to expect.
Hollow Knight: Silksong release time in your time zone
Hollow Knight: Silksong will release at 10 a.m. EDT on Thursday, Sept. 4, developer Team Cherry said on Bluesky (alongside an announcement of the game's $20 price point). Here's when that is in your time zone:
7 a.m. PDT for the west coast of North America
10 a.m. EDT for the east coast of North America
11 a.m. BRT for Brazil
3 p.m. BST for the U.K.
4 p.m. CEST for western Europe
11 p.m. JST for Japan
12 a.m. on Sept. 5 for the east coast of Australia
What to expect from Hollow Knight: Silksong
Team Cherry didn't send out early review copies of Silksong, so early impressions of the game have been minimal, based largely on brief previews tied to events like Gamescom and PAX West. Footage and previews so far indicate a game that fundamentally looks similar to its predecessor, albeit with a few gameplay tweaks, including a faster pace and some improvements to movement. Bosses revealed so far look truly disgusting (complimentary). You also play as a new protagonist, the Hornet. For its part, Team Cherry told Bloomberg that the lengthy development cycle had nothing to do with internal delays — just that the studio was too caught up in adding new stuff, like multiple hub villages, to the game. Ultimately, the full breadth of Silksong won't be clear until players, press, and content creators can go hands-on with the game. Could be more of the same. Could be a transcendent step forward for the genre that once again sets the bar. Could be something in the middle. Whatever the outcome, we'll find out soon.
