Pok√©mon-with-guns game Palworld is getting its first spinoff, the farming and cozy lifestyle-themed Palworld: Palfarm, developer Pocketpair announced Monday. Pocketpair describes the new entry in the Palworld universe as a farming experience set on an island where Pals work, cook, and craft to build the farm of your dreams. And as the first trailer for Palworld: Palfarm reveals, your Pals will be able to toil away in indentured servitude while you enjoy activities like fishing, farming, making snowpals, playing Russian roulette, and getting gay married by a Splatterina. Like any good farming sim, there's plenty of non-farming work to be done in Palworld: Palfarm. Players can interact with local island residents ‚Äî like blacksmith Anubis and Petallia the flower shop owner ‚Äî to build long-lasting relationships through conversation and gift-giving. Players will also need to defend their crops from malevolent Pals who may wreak havoc on their farms. And they can do it all with a friend; Palworld: Palfarm will support cooperative multiplayer. Palworld: Palfarm looks like a cozy (and humorously dark) spin on games like Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon. It arrives not long after a similar spinoff, Pok√©mon Pokopia, was announced for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. We don't know when Palworld: Palfarm will be released. The monster-catching open-world survival crafting game is coming to Windows PC via Steam, where you can wishlist it now.

Could be neat, wish some of the more farming centric features of this game were in their primary game instead of being kind of kitbashed together.

What pokemon game are they ripping off this time? Last I checked pokemon doesnt have a farming game and Nintendo doesnt have a first party farming game to begin with. Palword was closer to Ark than pokemon and if you want to go deeper pokemon is a rip off of countless games before it

Tyler¬†as mentioned (though briefly) in the article, nintendo just announced a 'pokopia' title to be released soon....itself a bit of a animal crossing with pokemon vibes ...I would love for the pal world devs to launch their version first haha

Tyler¬†Nintendo announced Pokopia not too long ago:https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-nintendo-direct-trailer/All laughs aside, I don't think the Palworld devs have that quick a turnaround that they could have planned this in the time after Nintendo's announcement. We'll probably find out in the next lawsuit.
