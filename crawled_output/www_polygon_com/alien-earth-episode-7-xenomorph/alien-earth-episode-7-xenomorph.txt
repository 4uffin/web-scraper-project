In Ridley Scott‚Äôs 1979 masterpiece, Alien, you barely see the Xenomorph at all. The choice had as much to do with the film‚Äôs budget limitations as it did with its director‚Äôs sensibilities (some of the shots of the monster in that movie look downright goofy by modern standards). Seven years later, James Cameron unleashed an entire brood of Xenomorphs on his human victims in Aliens, and the many films that followed have shown us more and more of the ‚Äúperfect organism‚Äù at the heart of the franchise. But there‚Äôs one thing we‚Äôve never seen, until now.
In its penultimate episode, Alien: Earth does something that only a show set on Earth could do: take the Xenomorph outside into the sun. While the movies all take place on dimly lit spaceships or dark, alien planets, the FX series is largely set on a tropical island controlled by an evil trillionaire. So it makes sense that eventually, the action would spill out of Boy Kavalier‚Äôs underground lab and into the daylight. That‚Äôs exactly what happens in episode 7.
'It‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôre gonna see full frontal Xenomorph outside'Image: FX
For Dana Gonzalez, who directed the episode and also an executive producer, it was a daunting challenge. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a scary concept,‚Äù Gonzalez tells Polygon. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôre gonna see full frontal Xenomorph outside. You‚Äôve only seen it in the dark.‚Äù It was important to both Gonzalez and showrunner Noah Hawley that this moment felt earned. After all, Alien: Earth could have easily started with a whole pack of Xenomorphs loose on Earth. The fact that they waited until episode 7 shows an impressive amount of restraint. ‚ÄúThe beauty of it is we‚Äôve earned it,‚Äù Gonzalez says. ‚ÄúNoah knew the audience had to be in a certain space to accept that.‚Äù
'She‚Äôs a pretty cool lady'Image: FX
Crafting a narrative that could plausibly bring the Xenomorphs out into daylight was one thing, but actually shooting those scenes was another. If you‚Äôre wondering how the Alien: Earth crew pulled off those scenes, the answer is simple ‚Äî a stunt person in a Xenomorph suit. Specifically, that person is Jayde Rutene. (Another stunt person named Cameron Brown plays the larger Xenomorph we saw earlier in Alien: Earth, until Sydney sliced its head off). ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a pretty cool lady,‚Äù says Alex Lawther, who plays Hermit on Alien: Earth, adding that working with a stuntperson is much easier than the alternative. ‚ÄúIn contrast to an animatronic, or even worse, a tennis ball on a stick, it's just easier performing in front of a person.‚Äù Gonzalez agrees: "That's why it works so well: [part of it] is truly practical.‚Äù

I admire what they're doing with the show and it's fantastic to see them toy with the xenomorph lore and how it interacts with humanity. However, the weakest part of the show and the thing that's ruined the immersion for me a few times this season has been how obviously the xenomorphs are just people in suits. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather this than CG any day, but I do feel like more could have been done in the direction or in the design of the costumes to obfuscate the fact.

If you search Alien: Covenant, the main image you will see is a xenomorph outside in the daytime, it's in the trailer when the the ship is escaping the planet. So is the "first" claim about it being specifically tropical sun?

Those weren't xenomorphs, they were technically neomorphs, so this article is correct.

The prequel films are non Canon apparently. Though kirsh seems to be a david/Walter generation android. The neomorph from covenant is a different species created by David trying to recreate the xenomorph queen (the dead body of whom is used to create to black ooze in prometheus. Her remains are under the green crystal "egg" tomb behind the giant engineer face, where there is a mural of a xenomorph queen. Personally I think Noah Hawley did use elements of the prequels in his writing.
