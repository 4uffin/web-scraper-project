Can I get the Fabien cut?
Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 feels like Assassin's Creed stapled to Disco Elysium

Early in Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2, it’s revealed that your character, the elder vampire Phyre, has killed the much younger Malkavian vampire Fabien. Phyre drank from him so deeply they drained his blood and devoured his soul, leaving part of his personality and memories rattling around their head. After playing through a closed-door, hands-on, hour-long demo at Gamescom, I discovered something similar happened during Bloodline 2’s troubled development process, and the result feels like two very different games stapled together. After spending far too much time skulking around and crawling through ducts in the first demo I played, the Gamescom experience let me step into Fabien’s shoes. While Fyre sleeps during the day, Fabien dreams, recalling his time as a noir-style investigator working for Seattle’s vampire sheriff. In the 1920s, he’s looking into the brutal murder of a cigarette girl working at a club that serves as Elysium, a safe gathering place for vampires. His investigation is fairly simple and linear as he chats with other vampires to learn about the victim and searches the scene of the crime with his supernatural awareness. His psychometry manifests as a conversation with the dead girl, a clever way to add pathos to the scene that fits well with the Malkavian clan’s mentally unstable nature.
“Each item he investigates, he assigns his own personality to and he has a conversation with the item,” The Chinese Room narrative director Ian Thomas told me. “Instead of saying, ‘Is this thing covered in blood?’ he talks to a dagger and goes, ‘Hey dagger, have you done a lot of fighting?” While his chat with the cigarette girl is pretty serious — she points out that Fabien never really noticed her before she was impaled by someone looking to send a message to Seattle’s vampires — Thomas says future interactions get a lot sillier. Fabien’s voice actor adopts about 20 different characters throughout the game, doing an Inigo Montoya-style exaggerated Spanish accent for the dagger and portraying a filing cabinet as a New York broad “who wants [Fabien] to rummage around her files.” I would be fine if all of Bloodlines 2 followed Fabien investigating mysteries and interacting with immortals with their own agendas in a sort of supernatural spin on Disco Elysium. But Thomas admits that Fabien wasn’t originally part of Bloodlines 2. Phyre initially had a different character living in their head, but early audiences found “it’s just depressing to be around these two people.” Two years ago, The Chinese Room came up with the idea of Fabien and a gameplay loop that would alternate between his remembered investigations and Phyre’s far more combat-focused nights.

“There are a lot of people who don’t want [combat] as their primary method of playing the game. They want other methods of play, other things they can do, and there’s an awful lot of story that we wanted to get into this game,” he said. “Two years ago, I think it’s fair to say that it would have been much more combat-focused.” Phyre is certainly a powerful combatant. After finishing the first few missions and big fights, you unlock the game’s full tree of in-clan disciplines, which is a much smaller selection than the Vampire: The Masquerade TTRPG provides. I hadn’t been impressed with Ventrue in my initial demo and opted for Brujah, who can use their increased strength and speed to make quick work of a mob of enemies. Brujah can also use their supernatural presence to strike fear in opponents, making them drop weapons that Phyre can grab with telekinesis. I remain frustrated that Phyre can’t just pick up weapons, and the Bloodlines 2 design team explained that even having Phyre be able to fire guns with telekinesis was a concession made to players who shared my sentiment.

“This is an elder, this is an individual that predates firearms as we know them,” Jason Carl, brand marketing manager for World of Darkness at Paradox Interactive told me. “Of course they know what weapons are, but Phyre has their own way of solving problems, and this is how they choose to do it.” Telekinesis is also Phyre’s primary way of moving around the city as they leap between rooftops. It’s a satisfying method of traversal, but if I wanted to swoop in on enemies from above I’d be playing Assassin’s Creed or Mirror’s Edge. Vampire: The Masquerade is a setting that shares more in common with the worlds of Blade or John Wick. I want to explore Seattle’s secret world by using my vampiric powers to command bouncers to let me in the private room in the back and see what twisted party is happening there, not just beat up thugs hanging out on the roof of a nondescript building. I’m told that Bloodlines 2’s gameplay opens up after this second demo, letting Phyre explore Seattle and unlock other powers. But I imagine I’ll just be waiting for them to go to sleep and let Fabien take the reins again. At least his story is something like the Vampire game I’ve been dreaming about, which seems to have been devoured by another beast entirely. Vampire: The Masquerade — Bloodlines 2 will be released on Oct. 21 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

This isn't bloodlines, like the other person said, take that name off, and release as an original IP.

Given the troubled development this has had I'm not expecting much, it's difficult to find any game that's had these problems and actually released as an awesome game.

Cuphead, Alan Wake, Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2, Psychonauts 2, Doom (2016), The Last Guardian, Metroid Dread, The Witcher 3, The Last of Us, StarCraft II, Cyberpunk 2077 (eventually).They happen.
Also, it sounds like Bloodlines 2 was much more combat focused, before it was assigned to The Chinese Room.
Sounds like a good turn at the end there.

Man, they should have just done a remake of the original, used the material to understand what kind of game it is, and then make a perfect appropriate sequel

My expectations for this gamenis SUPER low and a part of me wants them to drop Bloodlines from the name and spin it up as something else.

This is one of the best and sanest options I've heard.But since it's the gaming industry, we know they don't deal in logic.

Not like y’all would play it.VTM Swansong came out a few years ago and is very solid VTM experience that focuses on choices and the abilities of each of the three characters you play as and mostly nails the atmosphere…Most of the reaction to it was that it wasn’t what people wanted because it wasn’t a Bloodlines sequel.

Berethos08 oh no, I'm super playing it. I just feel this is similar to the Dragon Age 2 situation, where if they gave it a different subtitle, people probably wouldn't have the ginormous expectations of the previous game to go with it.

I cannot accept this "Phyre predates firearms" BS. Black powder weapons have been around in one form or another for centuries and Phyre would certainly have encountered them at some point.

not to mention what about more mundane weapons? you're telling me she's older than the first revolver (16th century) but... won't touch someone's knife or sword or whatever? or a fire axe? or a baseball bat (basically a club), or...

I actually tried playing the original Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines recently. I went to a lot of trouble to get it running on Linux, and managed to extract my old save from the GOG cloud. But once I started I just couldn't like...ignore the fact that it's so obviously built in the old source engine. I also ran into some devastatingly irritating bugs right off the bat like getting stuck on the corners of chairs in an apartment and having to literally reboot the game.Personally I think Disco Elysium is one of the best games ever made - we tend to just say like, best game of a certain year, but that one sits on such a high shelf in my heart. That and like, The Outer Wilds...Anyways this is very high praise and it sounds like they're trying to do something totally unique with the formula. I'm excited to give it a shot :) thanks for writing!

Jesus man . Never share your gaming options again. Because you obviously haven't played much of a anything. Disco and outer wilds are good games but that's it. They arent the best and never will be.Now just cause you obviously can't play older game properly like Bloodlines and make big deal of it being on source engine (as if that means anything) doesn't make it bad game. It has some bugs, guess what newer games have even more since they are more complex in code. Bloodlines is know as cult classic due to its characters, atmosphere and story. Not combat or free roam. This new game isn't doing anything new. Stop saying that. AAA studios haven't introduced anything new since years ago and Chinese room will just make it more of a walking simulator that they are known for. Nothing that is coming about this game looks good or should give positive feedback to anyone even remotely experienced with big studio games. It will have underwhelming story and characters. You can't even design your own. Cause fuck RPGs and fuck the Table top system it's made on apparently. It should have been as the other commenter here said it's own thing. It has nothing in common with what it's tryin to pass as.And the stupid no guns, no holding weapons gimmick is dumb. Even old vampires don't just use telekinesis for free. It's a waste of resources and obviously the developers are lazy or unable at this time to make animations for the character model.

I'm afraid that this game will be new DA Veilguard, a game that is simplified and essentially different from its predecessor, totally abandoning main strong points of frist game and TTRPG it's based on. There will probably be lots of praise for combat mechanics, even if it will be limeted and repetitive, just like with DA Vg., ignorong the fact that these franchises didn't become famous because of combat and arcade elements, it was story, characters and choices that made them great.

The more I think about it, as I replay Cyberpunk 2077 for the 4th time, Paradox/Onyx Path/White Wolf should have tapped CDPR for Bloodlines 2, and here's why- CDPR has already proved their dedication to the source material in 2 franchises, and after seeing the versatility in Cyberpunk's cyberware, I have no doubt that they could do disciplines justice. Potence? Gorilla arms. Celerity? Karenzikov. Auspex? Scanner mechanics, ping. Pressence and Dominate? Call backup, lure, cripple cyberware. The list just goes on and on.
