Who hasn't played Bop It before? This childhood audio game toy took over most of my life when I was a small kid thanks to its loud, exciting music and the ability to play it competitively with friends. Now, thanks to Alliance Games, the toy is getting its very own video game release with Bop It: The Video Game. For those who aren't in the know, Bop It is a toy that yells out commands like "BOP IT!" and "PULL IT!" among others. The player's task is to respond to whatever is said. For example, if the toy yells "twist it", the player must pull the twisted tool that's attached to the end of the toy. It sounds simple, but the difficulty ramps up the longer you play. Bop It was well-known for having a selection of groovy songs, and its video game iteration is no exception to that. It features an original soundtrack from artist 2Mello, who has worked on video games such as Read Only Memories and Later Alligator. This time 2Mello is swapping their soothing beats for something much more dynamic, with each track ramping up the BPM as you do your best to follow the Bop It's commands.

Bop It: The Video Game follows the same principle as the original. Follow the commands in time and build up a streak. If you mess up or go out of sync, you'll lose and go back to the beginning again. What makes the video game different, however, is that it offers alternative modes such as Extreme Mode, which adds SPIN and FLICK commands to keep up the intensity. However, this mode is only available for Mac, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC. It also offers local multiplayer, which, much like the physical version of the game, allows you to pass the device over during gameplay or compete for the win in Party Mode. The latter is, again, only available for Mac, Nintendo Switch and Windows PC. A leaderboard function will allow you to track your streaks globally, locally, or with friends only. If you've been looking for the chance to embrace the hype and versatility of Bop It in video game form, you'll be happy to know you won't have to wait long. Bop It: The Video Game launches Sept. 18 on Android, iOS, Mac, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC.
