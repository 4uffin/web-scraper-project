A decade's worth of work in Steam's Early Access went down the gutter, and the developers spent almost a year wondering why

Things were looking good for Planet Centauri. The pitch: Starbound meets Pokémon. Explore space, build homes, and capture and breed alien monsters. A decade's worth of work, which helped the game secure just over 138,000 wishlist placements on Steam. Early Access Steam reviews were mostly positive leading up to its 1.0 release. In December 2024, the multiplayer exploration game finally came out of development, launching on Steam for a reasonable $14.99. The devs weren't expecting wild numbers or anything, but they certainly weren't expecting to only move 581 units in a week. "We never understood why until today," Laurent Lechat, one of the developers wrote on social media earlier this month. Turns out, it was a freak accident. The duo behind Planet Centauri liken it to winning the lottery, except awful. According to the developers, Valve contacted the French duo behind the space exploration game this month to tell them that the platform failed to notify the users who had saved Planet Centauri on their wishlists. The game's launch visibility was completely shot. Interest in Planet Centauri seemed to be there, or at least its launch trailer managed to get just under 500,000 views on YouTube. But the people who had already expressed an interest in checking the game out had no way of knowing Planet Centauri was available. Without some of those sales, Planet Centauri could never hit tabs like New and Trending, much less Best Sellers. The game was practically dead on arrival. Speaking to Polygon, Lechat says that the team spent months feeling "intense" frustration, and that the developers were "questioning themselves" and felt a "loss of confidence." "We are of course perfectly aware of our own responsibility in the result," Lechat says, "but 500 sales in 5 days was totally incomprehensible."
Leading up to the game's 1.0 release, Planet Centauri had moved around 103,000 units. The number sounds impressive, except it was accrued over the course of about nine years. Coming out of the early access period was supposed to kick things up a notch. Statistics show that games that release in early access and have a 1.0 launch make more money than those that have a normal launch — that is, assuming they're successful at all. Both Lechat and his development partner Boris had spent several years sharing an apartment to minimize costs during the creation of Planet Centauri. Laurent had to sell his car, and they both did their best to avoid non-essentials. More recently, Boris had to move to a faraway village while Lechat continues having roommates. "All of this combined has allowed us to hold on for these 10+ years despite fairly lean finances," Lechat says. Hearing the news of the bug might've been heartbreaking enough to send Lechat into a rage on social media, but Valve wants to make things right. The studio is being offered placement on the platform's Daily Deal to "make up for lost visibility from your launch day," Valve said in an email. A daily deal would appear as a pop-up for all Steam users, if not appear on the platform's front page, as well as on pages highlighting ongoing sales. Can selling a game at a discount really rectify years worth of work, though? The studio wasn't sure if it was going to bite, not after everything was said and done. "I don't even have the strength to be angry," Lechat wrote on Reddit. "We've been so frustrated, disgusted, and in total confusion."

It was an understandable reaction, but the feedback the studio got from other developers suggested that a Daily Deal could help turn things around, if not emotionally, then at least financially. One developer told them that they saw 10 times their usual revenue off a daily deal, and another said a Steam Daily Deal had the biggest sales impact on their game they had ever seen. If the studio followed that up with content patches and periodic sales, they could start inching their way back to a better situation. "Players don't meticulously track games," one commenter offered. "People will see this and think it's your 1.0 launch. You can even share the story for those that look into it deeper." After sitting on it for a while, Lechat says they're going for it. What's the worst that could happen? In some ways, the developers have already moved on. They're working on a new game, which they hope to release in a year: a roguelike based on the same engine as Planet Centauri. The team says that it is under financial obligation to complete that project, and that doing so will help them bring future patches to Planet Centauri. As it is, due to the lack of sales, the studio couldn't justify continuing to update a game that wasn't financially solvent. "It's possible that Steam could have offered something more substantial," Lechat tells Polygon. "It's possible that the daily deal is, in fact, a great gift despite its limited 24-hour duration. We can't tell, and we will see and hope for the best. But in any case, reality is what it is, and we won't change it, so we might as well accept everything, take a breath and move forward."

This is a pretty feeble response from Valve. They have the money. They should leave it on the daily deal for a week. They should also purchase about 100,000 copies of it and give it away to users as a way to make it up to the developers and to promote the game.

polygon_user_m5453y9z they can afford it. Give them something to do with the 30% cut they make from every game sold instead of building giant eyeballs made of monitors.

At the very least they should be covering the difference between any 1.0 launch-day discount, and what I would expect to be a larger discount for the daily deal, so the devs get as much as they should have back then. Also, no offer to do a one-off 'relaunch' and send a new "sorry we forgot to tell you that this game on your wishlist came out, here's a daily deal on it btw" notif?Stingy AF

Yes, they should purchase 100,000 copies and give them away. Giving the developers the value of what each copy would be sold for, which is $0.10. I agree. $10,000.

I'm buying this game immediately, and paying full price. I only have $50 in my bank account until I get paid a week from tomorrow, so I really shouldn't do this. I'm doing it anyway

You're buying a game that you otherwise would have never heard about ahead of basic necessities like rent, food, etc? It's your choice but, maybe reevaluate your financial situation and the reason you only have $50 in your bank account.

Really like that polygon highlighted this story, giving the devs a bit more exposure. Good luck to them, this sounds like an absolute nightmare scenario of terrible look. Valve really should be doing a lot more to offset their own error.

You can get why they would be looking for someone to blame after all their hard work and I feel for them.... but as one of the 100000 who played it before the steam issue came out, it's got a LOT of problems as a game, which is far more likely the reason it didn't succeed over the people on its wishlist not being notified of its release...

People seem to overlook this. They see the title and think "oh no indie game didn't sell much, I should support", but don't actually know anything about the game itself or the issues it has. If the notification did get sent out and more people bought it, I bet there would've been alot of refunds shortly after.

I really feel for the devs, I truly do. And Valve has a huge part in the responsibility for how this happened. Thanks to Polygon also for sporting this article, we need more stories like these, not just success stories (as they are the minority anyways).However, these things do happen. Having large wishlist numbers wont necessarily help you even if launch is non-bugged. Our game, which we worked on for 6 years, had a promising lead-up to launch; many positive articles, 200.000+ wishlists, good coverage from Sony etc. Most reviews from the press were stellar and we even had a fairly solid meta-crit of 86 (i think). In the first year the game only sold around 100.000 copies. Almost not enough to pay for development. We did make some money eventually but not alot, certainly not to accrue for 6 years of dev-time. Still would not change the experience tho, it was super-hard but I learned so much, lotsa tough memories but lotsa beautiful ones too. But it just goes to show….you never ever know how these things are gonna play out. If you see someone bragging about their huge wishlist numbers dont be jealous, it might not just mean that much in the end.

hey Valve, why not send out the notification? and maybe allow it to relaunch itself, along with potential placement on new and trending?basically just do all the things you were supposed to do a year ago

Jump Ship / Jump Space has the same issueThere was nothing about its launch into early access on my homepage despite that I wishlisted it nor did I get an email like I normally do for my other wishlist games. Nor did I get any notificationsMy friends had to tell me it was out and the player count is abnormally low for how amazing the game isThis should be a breakout success like Helldivers 2 but it just isn't getting any traction near to what it should be getting

Comparing this game to Helldivers 2 is laughable. How much have you played the game? Do you really think it's of that quality that it deserves that kindof recognition? What about games like Freedom Planet 2 or Political Animals? Have you bought and played those that also had several year long development cycles from a small team and got little recognition? Here's a quote from the developer of one of those games:"After a less than restful sleep, I woke up to immediately check on our first day sales so far. We'd previously been informed that we'd be featured on the front page so I was a little bit excited. I'm struggling to remember what I felt when I finally saw the numbers.  Shock?  Sadness?  Probably a stunned silence.  Surely they couldn't be so low."What traction should this game get that those games didn't?

So just a quick question to Polygon. Why did you put "Alpha Centuri" and "Terraria" in the URL and metadata, when this has nothing to do with either of those games?

Don't buy it on Steam then if you want to "help the devs". Send them a check in the mail.

Talk about an opinion article..I love how they glossed over the fact that this has been in Early Access for a decade, and they don't even hit one of the most important aspects, which is how long ago did most of those people add this to their wish list. People who added this to the wish list 8 years ago aren't going to come back to buy this game, they've either no longer own a computer or have gone on to better games that their computers can handle or their interests have shifted as most gamers do. At a $15 price point. If somebody wanted to buy this they're still going to buy it. Stop trying to blame steam. It's really sad when developers and third parties tried to blame underperformance on other entities other than it was just bad timing. Had this released 3 years into Early Access it probably would have been a different story, 10 years is a bit of a joke. There's some good games that launched like 7 days to die, and a few others that have been in Early Access for a near decade but still saw success but it's very few and far between and I don't think this had the cult following that those Early access games did.Good try polygon at trying to blame steam for this one. I wonder how much this article cost the developers of that game

You gave money to Valve, who everyone seems to be condemning for how they handled the launch of the game.

If Valve contacted them, unprompted, apoligizing for a mistake and offering anything, it is very likely that the devs would have a case for a lawsuit, I dont know the specifics of releasing a game on steam, but if it states anywhere in a contract that a notification will be sent to those who have an early access game on thier wishlist when said game goes to full release, then the devs should look into a lawsuit regarding lost income...

Not likely. Steam is Valve's platform, and they can do with it as they wish. The "contract" is that you release the game on Steam. That's it. But if the developers would be stupid enough to spend what little money they have to hire a lawyer and claim a lawsuit that they will at best have thrown out right away or at worst will have to pay tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees when they lose the case.But hey, they can always release it on the Epic Store instead! They love dumping money into games noone would pay for otherwise as a free weekly giveaway.

They deserve better for Valve's screw-up. Like getting an increased cut of the comped Daily Deal sales, as if it were sold at full price.

I bought the game on EA, I feel really bad for the devs, I didn't know about that. I got a bit mad after finding a bug in my save (that I had a lot of trouble to get a sword in hell early game haha hours to get that without good equipment 😂) and put the game on hold. I'll play it rn, and I'll talk about it to my brother so he can stop Palworld for a while and try Planet Centauri as well.The game is good, guys.

So the game is buggy and broken, and you bought the game and gave a third of what you paid to EA.

If the developer sold it on a more consumer and developer friendly store than Steam, I'd buy. I don't even have a Steam account. Why not Itch.io or Epic?Indies are allergic to money, it's sad sometimes :-\

They aren't allergic to money, if anything it's the opposite. It's just a matter of fact truth, that indie games have a significantly bigger chance of breaking even if they're published as early access, and then full release, on Steam due to just how many people use the platform. The more eyes, the bigger the chances of making sales, and as consumer and developer friendly as other platforms are, they just don't have the same user base as Steam, and that's a cold hard fact.

Epic is literally the worst consumer friendly store. As for developers perhaps they pay em a percentage or something more but their anti market aggressive exclusion deals in the end just hurt those developers. literally everyone has a steam account and then you mention a niche store like itch.io lmaoalso they sell it on places besides steam

That's a bummer. This is not my kind of game but I'll buy it anyway to try help devs dust off. Glad to see so many gamers doing the same !

Gamers should spend money on games they don't want to play?

I feel sorry for the devs but I just dont see how this would be better than just playing Terraria, core keeper or Starbound. Or even modding either of them.Got too many games on the back burner and too many games releasing this year to pick up.

Oh no, the guy at the centre of the universe isn't buying it. Guess they have to delete it off steam and try again

I've read somewhere that it looks like Terraria, but plays very differently. Might be worth following that up if you are interested in buying.

nou Honestly they should, since the launch seems full of issues. Why buy a buggy, unfinished mess when there's so many better options that are so incredibly similar?

Nefrarya I've read somewhere that it plays pretty poorly. Lots of bugs, balancing is terrible, feels like it's thrown together in a blender. Might be worth following that up when it has another year of patches, assuming the devs don't just abandon it.

Yet another reason early access should be abolished. Sorry but the devs seem kinda douchy, 500 sales in a week seems incomprehensible?....why?

Because they got 260X more wishlist than that, a less than 0.5% wishlist to sale rate is not normal at all.Also this has nothing to do with the game launching in EA, this is steams fault

Because the first week is usually the biggest. 500 copies equals around 5k profit. That is nothing when you consider they worked on it 10 years. With this kind of sell numbers they will never even earn minimum wage. On top of that Steam is a scam they steal 30% from the devs when it should be less than 10%. Don't buy there.

Because more than 100000 had bought it previously. This was not some unknown game.
