Hollow Knight: Silksong is an unreasonable game. Like a matador waving a muleta at an incensed bull, it is a game that evokes a sharp fury. It’s a dare that players answer through impressive leaps, spectacular confrontations, and peregrine ambition. But Silksong refuses to be conquered, and will only yield long enough to hold up a mirror to its beholder.
I’ve spent close to 60 hours in Silksong, and were it not for this review, I’d probably have given up hours ago. Such was the rhythm of my playthrough of the original Hollow Knight: a game played in spurts, once the flow of time had washed away whatever reason made me put it down in the first place. I suspect that a significant proportion of the time I’ve spent in Silksong was not, in fact, playing Silksong. It’s hours of me, thumbs raw and raging, silently screaming. Hours of looking up advice, commiserating with strangers over an unusually cruel misery. Hours of deep inhales. Hours of trying to convince myself I could do it; hours of wondering if any of it was worth doing at all. Sitting with yourself, whether in disbelief or submission, is an intrinsic part of the Silksong experience.
A bleak world
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
Hollow Knight: Silksong is a Metroidvania roiled in mystery. You play as Hornet, a cross between an insect and a god, who has been dragged into a kingdom haunted by the effects of capitalism. The bugs in the lower caste work endlessly, faithful that the sheen of their toil will make them worthy of ascension. Their labor is in service to the Citadel, a holy city that attracts pilgrims. Most will never cross the Citadel’s gates, and they’re not meant to. Pharloom is a antagonistic world that gleefully tears its citizens into shreds. Those unlucky enough to survive are eventually infected by silk, an ethereal substance that binds bugs into eternal servitude. The denizens of Pharloom are thus stuck in a mindless haze that turns them hostile whenever their work is interrupted, which Hornet will do often. IRL parallels abound here, but Silksong never gets heavy-handed in its delivery. This is a bleak world that reinforces its own brutality in passing, like when Silksong asks the player to pay for every single save bench inside of Citadel, a supposed land of plenty. These are simple yet effective story beats that are delivered sparsely, through item descriptions and bits hidden throughout the world. You don’t need to engage with the narrative aspect of the game at all, nor do you need experience with the game’s predecessor. Even the lore freaks who know the original Hollow Knight’s endings by heart are still trying to suss out Silksong’s meaning. Ultimately, the game doesn’t need to waste any time spelling things out for you. Pharloom’s ambiance is akin to being at a thrift store where even the most ordinary of objects suggest a life just beyond the frame. These are handcrafted, gorgeous visuals that make it obvious why Silksong took seven years to craft. Mossy overgrowth clinging to abandoned stone, the sad drizzle of rain and fog descending on a graveyard, the golden hue of cogwork machinery: Silksong’s aesthetics and sense of place are an evocative powerhouse. The love and care Team Cherry has poured into Silksong’s style is most evident through the characters themselves. Fleas, moths, anthropods, arachnids: Silksong’s taxonomy makes for a singular world, at once believable and alien. These are endearing creatures, surviving in a world designed to crush them. Even as tragedy and sorrow lurk in the shadows, their mere existence kindles a flickering ember of hope. It’s beauty like this that makes the act of routing a path through Silksong’s disorienting maze all the more bearable, and that’s especially true during portions of the game where exploration produces scant rewards.
Image: Team Cherry
On a mechanical level, the game is a kinetic marvel. Though you may not have all of them at the start, the core verbs you'd expect in a platformer are here; jump, dash, hover, and so on. These are basic actions on their face, but implemented the complexity and finesse worthy of seminal games like Super Mario 64. Dozens of hours in, I’m still constantly in awe over the jumps I can engineer based on subtle differences in button presses and stick tilts. Hornet may be a demi-god of sorts, but she’s still a fragile little bugger. Her primary weapon is a needle with the pinpoint precision of a rapier. Combined with her acrobatic arsenal of movement, combat is designed to be a sophisticated gavotte. Like fencing, but more thrilling. Much of this has to do with Silksong’s controversial damage and healing mechanics. At the start, Hornet can endure about three consecutive hits from enemies and environmental hazards. No matter how much I improved at the game or upgraded Hornet’s abilities and health, damage always accrued quickly. Even the most basic of enemies seem to have been designed in anticipation of how a player might approach the encounter. If a flying enemy swoops in, your impulse might be to jump up to avoid it. Except, of course, attack animations tend to follow the specific trajectories a player might pursue in a panic. The correct answer is almost always the exact opposite of whatever your impulse might be, like dashing toward an enemy rather than away from it. I spent a significant portion of the game nearly dead, hands sweating in anxious palpitation. In the heat of the moment, my looming sense of mortality was torturous. Silksong makes it so Hornet accumulates silk with every attack, however, and once she fills up her gauge, the player can heal themselves. Healing takes a few seconds to power up, but Hornet can pull it off even mid-jump. The combination of constant close calls, interspersed with tide-turning palliative measures, made for exhilarating moments of pure adrenaline.
Expectations upended
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
Nothing I’ve played this year has reached Silksong’s high of being in the final phases of a boss fight, Hornet visibly slumping in pain, and pulling off an unlikely heal. Then again, nothing I’ve played this year has matched the lows that come with dying repeatedly to common enemies and bosses alike. Silksong is deeply in conversation with platforming and Metroidvanias as a genre, and defies those conventions with verve. Here is the source of friction players are ardently grappling with in public through the ongoing debates about the game’s difficulty. That outcry is steeped in a feeling of betrayal: Team Cherry has a keen understanding of what fans expect, and Silksong uses that knowledge to break an unspoken contract. A boss battle is supposed to have three rounds of stagger, and a handful of different phases at most. The reward – and there is always a reward – must be consummate with the imposed challenge. The game can be tough, but only if it feels fair. Players should feel empowered, and, failing that, should have fun. There are a litany of axioms, some accrued over a lifetime of experiences with games, which many of us use as a barometer for whether a game is “good.” They are the “quality of life” design decisions that a developer might highlight during a talk at a conference about maximizing player engagement.
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
As far as I can tell, Team Cherry cares for none of that. Silksong will place a frustrating boss fight that lasts longer than it should after a section of onerous platforming that you’ll have to repeat every time you retry the battle. And you’ll retry that showdown for hours. You will spend ages attempting to topple a boss only to have it blow up at the end of the fight, taking you with it. This will then force you to do it all over again. You lost, sucker! Silksong will offer a save station only after you’ve already explored most of a new area, when it is the least useful, and it’ll charge you for the privilege. Silksong will make demand after demand only to unceremoniously kill you anyway, just when you thought you were safe. Silksong’s challenge borders on barbaric. The closest parallel I can think of is Infinite Jest, an infamous tome whose mere construction acts as a deterrence. To read it is to spend most of your time feeling lost. Most people who try it will never finish the book. David Foster Wallace was entrenched so deeply in his own BS that he’d spend entire chapters describing upsetting or absurd events, like wheelchair assassins shoving a broomstick up a man’s ass. He nestled critical plot points in the middle of footnotes that the reader may well glaze over after being tricked one too many times into reading an entire page’s worth of bone-dry medical terms. But no matter how much the book might seem to want to troll you, DFW didn’t feel disdain for his readers. The opposite, really. Much of the late author’s life was spent in an earnest attempt to combat cynicism and self-centered entertainment. The point of Infinite Jest wasn’t to vex the reader, at least not entirely, but to challenge our notion of what a novel should be and to encourage self-reflection on how we consume entertainment. This is how I’ve made sense of Silksong’s predilection for ‘runbacks,’ which refer to strips of the game a player must traverse before taking on a boss. Many modern games, including the notoriously difficult Souls games, have all but done away with runbacks. The encounter itself might be insufferable, but the upshot is that most games will plop the player somewhere near the boss battle after they die.
Hollow Knight: Silksong is made by a tiny team, but it's still a bigger production, according to HushCrasher.Image: Team Cherry
Silksong does not do this. Every boss I’ve fought requires some type of runback, and the farther you get into the game, the more elaborate these become. There are portions of the game where the platforming itself is as difficult as the boss battle. In practice, this can mean that by the time you crawl back to the boss room, Hornet might be hanging on by a thread of health. That’s if you get through at all. I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time in Silksong just completely tilted, reduced to a total stereotype of an angry gamer. Is Silksong inherently a worse game because of this design choice? If you look at it from the perspective of approachability, with the assumption that players should be able to make reasonable progress with enough effort, sure. It’s not “good game design.” By that same measure, it strikes me just how restrictive my notions of what a game “should” do truly are. Somewhere down the line, I’ve conflated convenience and comfort with quality. Games can be art under this framework, but let’s be real. The primary function of a game designed around the wants and needs of the player is entertainment. In the case of Silksong, what began as a passion project for a tiny studio in Australia exploded well beyond its originally intended audience. The first Hollow Knight began as a Kickstarter project with a mere 2,158 backers; the game has since gone on to sell 15 million copies. The price of that exposure is pressure to conform and to become digestible. To not buckle under those expectations is remarkable and a testament to Team Cherry’s clear-eyed creative vision. I say that as someone who very well may never be able to beat Silksong, and in spite of the small tuning patch the game received a week after its release. Conviction like this is increasingly becoming a rarity for games with this type of reach. For all the grousing, even Souls games don’t intentionally inconvenience the player nearly as much as Silksong dares to. Coincidentally, Souls games like Elden Ring have never been more popular than they are now. The older ones, the ones that made Souls games into cult darlings, are transgressive in the same way Silksong is. You can’t talk about Dark Souls 2 without also talking about those awful runbacks, for example. Diehards will argue that’s the best one.
Run it back
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
There’s lots I haven’t touched on in this review, like Silksong’s upgrade system, Hornet’s roster of tools, and the quest system. Truthfully, these are the least interesting parts of the game. Generally speaking, no matter what Hornet equips or how she develops her powers, her abilities will never make her next hurdle any easier. At best, new abilities equip Hornet to go back and discover more pathways. Sometimes, these new areas will bestow new powers upon the player. More often than not, whatever awaits you at the end of the new path you’ve opened will feel disappointing. You could spend hours traipsing an impossible expanse only to find a poem or a meager cache of resources. You have to do it for the love of the game, if you can muster it. I can't help but chuckle at the thematic irony here. I spent a lot of Silksong shaking my head at the misguided devotion of the Pilgrims. Yet there I was, extolling suffering as virtue. Surely this time, a small voice in my head thought, my efforts would be recognized materially. The Silksong experience transcends that which you control on the screen. It is internal work and therefore infinitely more daunting than anything the game could possibly throw at you. You will die repeatedly. You will get angry. Your anger will envelop you like a toxic sludge. Things might deteriorate enough that you’ll suddenly become worse at the game. Perhaps you might wonder if Silksong is something you’ll ever be able to beat. The thing about those runbacks is that, if you do them enough times, at a certain point you have to confront some ugly truths about yourself. Like: I’m impatient. I want to speed things up, and my approach becomes greedy. I move without intention. I’m ruled by impulse and fear, and these tendencies blind me to extremely obvious boss calls. I’m doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.
Image: Team Cherry via Polygon
At a certain point, what seems unfair turns out to be edifying. That part of the level that began as an exasperating exercise in futility becomes second nature. Whatever I was cursing to hell and back turns out to be something I can overcome after all. “You seek to vanquish and transcend the limited self whose limits make the game possible in the first place,” David Foster Wallace wrote in Infinite Jest. He’s talking about tennis here, but I can’t help but think about Silksong in a similar context. “It is tragic and sad and chaotic and lovely. All life is the same, as citizens of the human State: the animating limits are within, to be killed and mourned, over and over again…” In Silksong, there’s always a new horror that will replace whatever last vexed you. You could become discouraged, and likely, you will, at least for a while. Eventually, though, you’ll tap into one unassailable truth: you are capable of more than you realize.

Thanks for the review!
I've been wondering if I should buy this game, and now I know that I should not because I would hate it.
I emphatically do not appreciate frustration as a game feature.
Life is too short and the world is falling apart; I don't need anything else to make me mad

'Eventually, though, you’ll tap into one unassailable truth: you are capable of more than you realize'I do sometimes wonder if we kid ourselves into thinking that persisting with a difficult video game somehow makes us more resilient, or builds confidence, or in any way gives some kind of mental advantage that can be applied to anything other than video games. Video games are specifically structured to keep you engaged even when they are difficult, they offer clear rules and a pretty much certain guarantee that you will succeed if you continue persisting. They know how to hit our dopamine receptors even when they are frustrating. Nothing in life works like this; it is not structured, curated or designed with you in mind, nothing is put there to reward you, there is no guarantee of success no matter how much work you put in. I'm not sure we should be kidding ourselves that persisting with a video game gives you
any ability to persist with anything else in reality except video games.

Having said this, I love the game. I just don't think it has the ability to change your personality.

no one should be moralizing how themselves or another play a video game. thats ALL nonsense. no one is required to engage with or continue engaging with a game they don't want to play.

thesmirkingpoor Not sure there is any moralising in this review really? She is just reflecting her personal experience. But I think it's stretching reality to say that persisting with a hard video game gives you resilience in life. It just means you'll be better able to tackle difficult video games, not difficult life challenges. The two things are unrelated.

Determination is indeed a transferable trait.

@polygon_user_m4vi7sjc I disagree. Determination is easy in a video game because it has been specifically designed to be completed. It has been crafted by human hands to have an ending and it is designed from the off to be able to be completed. This does not apply to something like climbing Mount Everest, or writing a book, or building a house. Mount Everest was not designed to be climbed, you can try to climb it but it's intention is not to be climbed. It doesn't care about you and what you want from it.
Video games care only about you and have also been designed to give you breadcrumbs of progress, encouragement, and structure in order to help you get to the end. You are rewarded constantly to keep you engaged and motivated. It is easy to stay determined in a video game because it has been specifically engineered to keep you engaged and determined.

This may be an annoying take, but I think the discourse around Silksong is an interesting case study for the whole "video games as art" discussion. From what I've heard, Silksong is a deeply frustrating and difficult game that doesn't hold players' hands at all, but that's entirely by design -- it's by all accounts a masterpiece, and as such it simply isn't going to be appealing to all gamers. Many folks have handled that with grace. Others have not.You can tell from Hernandez's review that the game wasn't something she particularly enjoyed playing, but she's also a professional that knows how to critique a game without relying too heavily on personal opinion as a factor. I genuinely wish that more game reviews could live up to that standard.

Some of my complaints of the game are that it often doesn't feel like the experience was designed, more that things just happened to fall into place the way they did. I'm not saying it's the case, but it is the feeling the game evokes.The runbacks are a great example of this. Some are quick, easy and have no threats on the way. Others are punishing, extremely long, and tedious. And which is which has seemingly no pattern. It feels random. If every boss had a small gauntlet of challenges before it, it would feel intentional, designed to be that way. I'd even argue there's probably be less complaints about them, since it would be abundantly clear that getting to the boss is part of the fight. In its current form, it's hard to see the intention and instead feels like a missed opportunity to make the game more enjoyable.

You can't weight art and observe that it has 10 pounds of great level design. It is entirely subjective. The best thing you can ever get from a reviewer is their honest opinion. If they are giving you anything else, including if they say a game is great even though they hated every moment of playing it, you are not getting anything useful beyond perhaps good writing.I really think the best thing we can hope for in reviews of anything is an entertaining read(which this was) and hopefully honesty. This review is saying the game is good but everything described in it is not what I want from a game so I will stay well away.

It's not an annoying take. But it's speaks more volumes to why a game like Silksong gets to get a pass on the difficulty curve vs other games. I'd mention more but they keep deleting my posts about it.

Sometimes modern games discourse looks actually insane."Is it "good"? Is it "fun"? Would I say that I "like it" or "enjoy playing it"? No, of course not. Would I criticize a lesser game for doing it? Of course. But god damn it's the greatest game of all time anyway!"I haven't played Silksong, I likely won't play Silksong--no reflection of the game itself, it simply isn't for me--but sometimes games like this make video game discourse look like it's taking place in Bizarro World.

I'm having the same reaction to so much of the writing around this game. Describing a mountain of awfulness only to say "but its awfulness is great".Would reviewers be talking about it the same if this was a brand new game from unknown developers?

The response to these challenging games does sometimes seem a bit Stockholm syndrome-y to me. 😅I suppose I don't get the same "dopamine hit" as others. But then my sense of achievement is always tempered by the fact that any tough boss I have surmounted has literally been beaten by millions of other gamers. 🤷

It’s pretty simple, some people appreciate being pushed out of their comfort zone. It’s less about pleasure, more about a sense of growth

The problem with Silksong imo is that it is a very strange blend of some of the best gaming has to offer, and some of the worst. As the reviewer put it, the highs are extremely high, but the lows are maddening (mostly due to how "fixable" they feel). Also, this review absolutely does not make a case for it being the greatest game of all time, or even this year.

Some people enjoy frustration, enjoy being disempowered and having to over come that in a gaming context. Why is this so difficult for folks to comprehend?

I feel like the difficulty in the game is inversely proportional to how patient the person playing it is. Some of the tougher bosses like Punished Trubbio or whatever the fuck his name were frustrating until I stopped trying to finish it ASAP and saved the damage for wide openings, like his twirly move. Which strikes me as ironic, because the runbacks to get to the boss encourage the opposite. I have one nitpick with the review though. "You can’t talk about Dark Souls 2 without also talking about those awful runbacks, for example. Diehards will argue that’s the best one."
I enjoy DS2. I played it quite a lot. And I have never, ever heard anyone argue it's the best one. Not a single miserable soul.

"I enjoy DS2. I played it quite a lot. And I have never, ever heard anyone argue it's the best one. Not a single miserable soul."DS2 was so poorly received that From made a do-over version of the game - which is still generally placed at the bottom of the greater Souls canon.

Craig DS2 had some of the best ideas in the series, some of which were unfortunately left on the vine. It was less cohesive than others but its still the second best dark souls.

Are there still standard enemies that take 15 hits that you just have to wait 5 seconds between their attacks to land a single blow? Hollow Knight has such an insane amount of basic flaws people just gloss over that just disrespect a players time.

Haven't finished the game, but the basic enemies - while spongy - are pretty good about having lots of openings imo. Except some of the flying fuckers that actively keep their distance from you. Those can eat sand.I do agree with HK having glossed flaws. I'm a bit happy that the initial audience for Silksong has made these flaws a bigger part of the discourse. Some of fixed wonderfully (sprinting), others are not (the map and quick travel systems are unchanged).

For god's sake: DO NOT nerf this game, Team Cherry! If I can't handle the heat, I stay out of the kitchen. That easy. A game should be treated like art: Not everyone needs to like it. This game broke me. And that's fine.

Maybe. But it's also possible for an artist to see how the public is receiving their work and realizing that it did not quite accomplish what they intended. If that's the case (which maybe it is, maybe it's not) it's not compromising their vision to make adjustments accordingly.

yovargas As with the Switch 2 launch, it's clear that "media" portion of the gaming industry - both Youtube/Twitter/Twitch, and more conventional outlets like Polygon - are wildly out of touch with the greater public. Thee's nothing but complaints about difficulty from social media addicts and shut-ins, but meanwhile its completion rate on Steam is already approaching the first game's.

yovargas this game was infamously in dev for a long long time. There is nothing a player can tell them about the game. I can see a company react that way if they fear for their income but I don’t think any artist would do that.

thesmirkingpoor Other players can tell them one very crucial thing about the game that they can't learn by themselves - how the game feels to play to other players. I imagine they didn't spend 7 years making this game just to play it themselves so they surely had an intended player experience in mind. It would be very, very easy for someone in Cherry's position to not do enough player testing and realize after the fact that they had tuned the difficulty much higher than they intended to because they were mostly just playing it themselves. I'm not saying I think that's what happened here, but it would be very easy and very possible for that to happen.

Is the game frustrating at times (boss fights and locked rooms)? Helll ya, but the satisfaction you get when you figure it out and play well is rewarding. I think as gamers, we've been conditioned to play offense anytime we pick up a controller. This game changes that approach, and you're forced to play smarter, more defensively, and slower. You get punished for just trying to hack your way through the game. Pacing is everything and it's what makes Silksong — Silksong.

The problem with the "this game is too hard" discourse for me is that most people are saying that out of FoMO. But it's presented as an accessibility thing, because that's more acceptable as a critique. I get you wanna play Silk Song - I do too! But I can tell it's just not for me at all. I don't begrudge the devs for that at all, not everything has to be for everyone. Getting comfortable with that will make you much happier in the long run.

I'm finding the difficulty to be not nearly as bad as hyped, I was expecting Sekiro levels of difficulty based off of what I was hearing. Finishing Infinite Jest is much harder than any of this.

I find it
unlikely that the developers had such lofty goals when they were envisioning the player doing a runback for the 50th time. There's challenging level design that tests the mettle of the player and then there's this game. Hollow Knight had some rough edges, but it laid the foundation for an all time great franchise. I wrongly assumed that the 5+ years developing Silksong were spent ironing out all the imperfections or at least trying to.The time wasting exercises and lack of rewards and player progression in Silksong are a little more than just head scratching. I mean this stuff isn't subtle and implying that they're somehow an attempt to foster introspection and self-discovery on behalf of the player is kind of stretching it. These things are certainly desirable and welcomed in certain respects and genres, but you're being a little too charitable imo. A relatively small shift in design philosophy, to one that is much more respectful of the players time, would improve this game exponentially and no one would be saying, "ah but I really didn't learn enough about myself".

I don't think the author was implying that the game was designed to invoke those feelings, just that the design happened to lead them there.

A lot of what you're saying applies to my experience of playing Dark Souls for the first time – one of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life. But I don't think I'm in the right frame of mind for that kind of experience right now. I couldn't make it through Hollow Knight. I'm not sure if I'll ever be ready for that kind of intense experience again. But maybe.

the bending over backwards people do to defend these runbacks. then you have "quality of life" up there in quotes like it's some foreign concept. i know team cherry can do no wrong, but all the mean spirited traps, ambushes, and spikes, oh so many spikes wear me down to the point that i don't care anymore why religion made the bugs sad. gameplay should never debase itself before narrative. what's the gameplay justification for slooowly going into a dream, traversing 20 screens worth of enemies & spikes to arrive at the boss with 2 masks (which are 1 if you've been paying attention) dying in seconds, then sloowly waking up to do it all over again? how does all that make the game better? maybe years from now, people will see that for what it is: a pointless hazing ritual.

I think the frustration that tends to comes from games like Silksong is that there tends to be this hesitation to provide any really criticism to either the game or the genre.
Acting as if souls likes are still the "little guys" when the genre has blown up in the last 10 years, where every other game is a metroidvania, rouge-like, or souls-like, where even AAA gaming has started taking mechanics from those games.
So while not every game has to be for everyone, nor should it, I don't really buy into the notion that because it's Team Cherry's intention to make the game "friend me in the alps" hard, that that shields it from any criticism--it just merely provides context to those games.
So as these games get more and more popular, I do think these criticisms will crop up more and more.
And the difficulty criticism is just as valid as defending said difficulty as "the point."

I stopped playing after 15 hours of having a mostly miserable time, as it sounds like nearly everyone who plays does.I started another metroidvania that has QoL features and doesn't relentlessly waste your time, and honestly, it feels like escaping an abusive relationship.Silksong feels like an Emperor's New Clothes situation, where people got so hyped after waiting so long, that they can't admit that so much of it is actually brutally unfun game design.The art and music are wonderful though.

Capitalism? Where in the game is capitalism? The bugs in the world are explicitly pilgrims on a pilgrimage (not workers like you say?) to the Citadel.I just got past Fourth Chorus - am I not far enough to uncover this capitalism allegory? The story and world of the game feels much more like a swipe at organized religion, mostly the Catholic Church than anything. I mean, the currency is literally rosary beads.

There is a brand of leftist who sees the evils of capitalism everywhere, as if capitalism invented powerful and wealthy people oppressing the weak and small.

yovargas One of my favorite tidbits is that social media's favorite phrase, "late[-stage] capitalism", was coined 100 years ago by a man who firmly believed he was living in its last days. Cultish millenarianism for materialists. That said, the Underworks is clearly an extended joke about oppressed manual laborers.

I don't think that you're quite far enough. There's a section of the game that is clearly a sweatshop-esque area, and has a lot of mechanics that you'll interact with that reinforce the feeling of the oppressive economics of its world.

congrats you stuck with a challenging game. There is no doubt that hard games should exist just as any other game. “Quality of life” is not a concept that should exist in game design, a game is not a doorknob or a walkway. A game doesn't need to "respect a player's time" when that player can walk away at ANY time.Hollow Knight: Silksong is an unreasonable game.No it isn’t, there is no such thing.

Quality of life is absolutely a proper concept for game design. Games have affordances just like a doorknob. You can make a game hostile to the player if that's your intention, but if it's not your intention, you're probably just making a bad experience if you don't learn what works and what doesn't. And games should respect the player's time if, y'know... they don't want players to feel like their time is being wasted, which is typically not what people are looking for in their entertainment.
