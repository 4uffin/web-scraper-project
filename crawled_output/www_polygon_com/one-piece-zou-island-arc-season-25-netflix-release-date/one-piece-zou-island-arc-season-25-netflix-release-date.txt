Netflix is getting more One Piece episodes, and it’ll be one of the biggest hauls yet with the addition of the Zou Island Arc. The first batch of new episodes is headed to the streaming service in Oct. 2025, but it's still unclear exactly how many will be available at that date. Instead of listing the Zou Island Arc as one large season, Netflix has split it into three parts. At the time of writing, there is no official confirmation that all three parts will be released all at once (this also fits well with the streamer's recent strategy of breaking up its own hit shows into multipart drops). There are currently 750 episodes of One Piece available to stream on Netflix, and the Zou arc consists of 29 episodes in total. If you load the landing page for One Piece on Netflix, you can see that "season 25" of the anime is scheduled for release on Oct. 1, 2025. (The anime isn't structured into seasons, instead airing continuously, while the plot can be broken up into narrative arcs.) Last year, the Marineford Arc, Fishman Island Arc, and Punk Hazard Arc were added to Netflix. In 2025 so far, we’ve seen the addition of the entire Dressrosa Arc and the filler arc Silver Mine. At the time of writing, there is no confirmation when the next arc after Zou, Whole Cake Island, is coming to Netflix.
Zou is a short but great setup arc filled with lore and a nifty flashback that results in one of the greatest reveals in One Piece history. It may not seem to have many implications for the story at large, but it has a massive impact on the crew, showcasing a display of loyalty and bravery that especially resonates with Usopp. Hopefully, it comes into play in his character development in due time! One Piece season 25 arrives on Netflix Oct. 1.

I dunno if I'd call it one of the greatest, I mean...I think the arc right after is better because we dive so deeply into Sanji's family history. It's one of the saddest, most heartbreaking arcs of all because of not only Sanji's family and what they've done to him...but we learn Big Mama's backstory and Linlin's own past is truly heartbreaking too...and horrifying. Darn it, it's so hard to pick a One Piece arc as the greatest, so much of them build up on one another and they're all so darn good! Except for maybe, I dunno, Davy Back, I can't really think of any story arcs that are bad or unnecessary or could be easily excised.

"Hopefully, it comes into play in his character development in due time!"You're kidding right? Usopp didn't have a twinge of development since.... Dressrosa, the arc preceding Zou. Even in the current manga/anime episodes, when they finally reach the land of the giants, which he's been hammering on about since basically the beginning of the series, Usopp is barely doing anything.

I think the focus on Usopp during that reveal, especially being the coward of the group, wasn’t by mistake. He takes it especially hard because he very possibly would’ve sold out his friends during the torture. if it doesn’t come into plays, it will be one of the biggest missed opportunities in the entire story.

Yeah I don't know how to stream every other arc, but my Netflix only gives me the option to watch the 200 newest episodes. But I guess it's great it's adding more arcs for y'all.
