Marty McFly and Doc Brown are heading Back to the Future for the film’s 40th anniversary, and this time, they’re making their IMAX debut. Universal dropped a new trailer for the 1985 classic, spotlighting its iconic score and all the nostalgia fans could ask for. Somehow never seen it? Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the legit sci-fi comedy masterpiece follows 17-year-old Marty McFly, who’s accidentally transported 30 years into the past thanks to a DeLorean built by his eccentric friend, Doctor Emmett Brown. Then Marty accidentally romances his mom. It's weird! Back to the Future will return to theaters nationwide for a limited run in IMAX, as well as Dolby Cinema, 4DX, and D-Box formats. It was previously announced that the trilogy will also receive individual limited-edition 40th anniversary 4K steelbooks, releasing on Oct. 14 for $49. There will also be a gift set exclusive to Amazon, featuring different steelbook art than the separate products, along with its own physical collectors' items, including a mini Gibson guitar replica and an OUTATIME license plate.

If pop culture is any indication, Back to the Future has stood the test of time. Back in 2015, fans marked Oct. 21 as “Back to the Future Day,” celebrating the date Marty jumps ahead to in Part II. Even contemporary shows like Rick and Morty get their entire premise from this classic "young man and old guy do adventures" setup. Also, who could forget those deepfakes with Tom Holland and Robert Downey Jr. playing Marty and Doc, which made people clamor for a remake that ultimately never happened? Basically, if you or your loved ones have yet to see this classic, please make this your Halloween 2025 activity.
