Fans of Hideo Kojima must feel truly ecstatic after Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary event on Tuesday. Not only did they get the first full trailer for OD - Knock, the anticipated video game collaboration between Kojima and Jordan Peele, but they were also treated to the trailer for Death Stranding Mosquito (working title), an anime set in the universe of Kojima's Death Stranding games. The anime movie will be directed by Hiroshi Miyamoto (Eiga Precure Dream Stars!, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero) and produced by ABC ANIMATION STUDIO, with a screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski, who created and wrote the acclaimed (but still prematurely canceled) sci-fi show Raised by Wolves, produced by Ridley Scott.
Not much is known about Death Stranding Mosquito, but the trailer shows that the vibes and visuals will be in line with the eerie and somber atmosphere of the games. Two unnamed characters duke it out in a classic anime martial arts fight for most of the trailer. One seems dressed as a porter, like Sam Porter Bridges. The other has a creepy, elongated mosquito-like mouthpart made of tar, the supernatural, viscous black substance that plays an integral part in the Death Stranding games. Interestingly, this character also seems to be protecting a Beached Thing, further teasing a connection with the Beach. At the moment, there is no release date for Death Stranding Mosquito. A live-action movie adaptation of Death Stranding is also in the works, produced by Hideo Kojima and Hammerstone Studios' Alex Lebovici, and directed by Michael Sarnoski.
