The fifth and final season of Netflix’s hit coming-of-age horror series Stranger Things premieres on Nov. 26 and showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer say it will be the biggest ever in terms of action, visual effects, and story. The Duffers teased what’s in store in a featurette released on Sept. 24 that offers a glimpse of the final confrontation between the heroes of Hawkins and Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). Most of the footage was already revealed in the July teaser trailer aside from Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) holding a walkie-talkie in front of a house covered in vines from the Upside Down and Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman) driving a truck with Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke) riding shotgun. The show’s stars echoed the Duffer Brothers, with Finn Wolfhard saying “It’s the highest stakes the show has ever been,” and Millie Bobby Brown sharing that “everybody is really put into the thick of it. No one is sitting back on a walkie-talkie.” While the featurette goes heavy on the action, it also flashes back to far more lighthearted moments from the show’s run, like the boys all dressed up as the Ghostbusters and playing Dungeons & Dragons. Amidst plenty of speculation about who will survive the final season, it also pays tribute to the characters who have already been killed by monsters, including Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) and Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery).

Stranger Things premiered in 2016, meaning its original cast of middle schoolers are all old enough to drink. “I got to watch these kids grow, which is the biggest gift that this show has given me,” Winona Ryder says in the featurette. Hopefully the final season will deliver a proper goodbye for viewers who have done the same. The first four episodes of season 5 of Stranger Things premiere on Netflix at 5 p.m. PT on Nov. 26, with three more episodes releasing on Christmas, and the finale dropping on New Year’s Eve.

I love this show, but I will say 50% of the "action" is MBB holding a hand out and screaming
