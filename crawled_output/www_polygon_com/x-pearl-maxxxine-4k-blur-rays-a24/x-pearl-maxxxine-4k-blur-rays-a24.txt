Ti West's X trilogy can be streamed across various platforms, but horror fans eager to add the trilogy to their physical collection have some good news: A collector's edition of the trilogy is now available to pre-order at the A24 Films storefront for $100. X, Pearl, and MaXXXine are well-loved for being intoxicatingly decadent in their exploration of the human psyche, the fracturing of family units, and our desperate bid for connection in a society that feels shallow. In many ways, the trilogy feels like a love letter to the slasher genre, which is why the physical collector's edition is such a must-have for horror fanatics. The collection actually marks the first time X and Pearl have been physically released in 4K UHD in the US. The X Trilogy: Collector's Edition box set includes the trilogy in both Blu-ray and 4K UHD formats, and comes with a box set that includes a 64-page booklet featuring an essay from filmmaker and writer Jon Dieringer.

The collection will also include unreleased concept art from the films, such as Pearl in her iconic red dress, as well as costume sketches, artwork of the original film posters, as well as behind-the-scenes photography. If you thought you knew everything you needed to know about these films before, guess again, because A24's collector's edition of the X trilogy has plenty to show you. Below is a full list of all the bonus features included in the 3-disc digibook, categorized by the individual film.

X and Pearl were literally the worst horror films I have EVER watched. To say these are "highly acclaimed" is a big fat lie. Never heard one good review nor heard another human soul say they "enjoyed" it.

Surely you jest? Just search for Pearl on Rotten Tomatoes, for starters.
