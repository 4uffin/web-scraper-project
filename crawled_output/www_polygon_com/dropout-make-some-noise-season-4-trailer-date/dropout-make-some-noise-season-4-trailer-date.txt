Hot off the heels of Game Changer spinoff Crowd Control's September debut, Make Some Noise comes back for season 4 in October. Its trailer showcases a carousel of your favorite Dropout comedians returning for more improvised bits, gags, and whacky noises. The news release promises "new challenges, new surprises, and the same amount of absolute chaos" for Make Some Noise. One of those new challenges will be a Kid Round, featuring prompts ostensibly written by children (adorable). SNL's Jeremy Culhane is the honoree (victim?) of a kid's hand-written prompt asking for dramatic barfing. The show's comparison to Whose Line Is It Anyway? is also addressed by a prompt asking for a "Gangster Drew Carey," though there's no word yet if Whose Line alum Wayne Brady will guest again. Make Some Noise spun off from the Noise Boys episodes of Game Changer, and fans can expect the trio of Brennan Lee Mulligan, Zac Oyama, and Josh Ruben to return for more hijinks, weird Josh Ruben noises, and Lord of the Rings prompts for Mulligan to chew on. Other Dropout favorites like Anna Garcia, Lisa Gilroy, and Jacob Wysocki are also set to appear as well, along with Sonic the Hedgehog himself, Ben Schwartz. The fourth season will air 15 episodes every other week. It premieres Oct. 13 on Dropout.
