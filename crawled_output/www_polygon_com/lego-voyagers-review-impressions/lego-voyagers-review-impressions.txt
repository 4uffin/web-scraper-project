This fun, frictionless co-op game is a shade too tasteful
Lego Voyagers is true to the Lego spirit — perhaps to a fault

An aspect of Lego that has sometimes been lost in its rush into licensed product over the last couple of decades — and even in some of its own lines, like Ninjago — is its impeccable Scandinavian taste. This sensibility, shared by other Scandi brands like Ikea and Volvo, is all about wedding form and function, good sense and good taste, in a clean, almost utopian design aesthetic. It’s best represented by the Lego Creator series’ invitation to investigate the anatomy of typewriters, helicopters, and dinosaurs, or by Lego City’s cheerful society of civic servants: astronauts, garbage collectors, and police without guns. It’s seldom reflected in Lego video games, though, due to the prevalence of fantasy licences like Star Wars and Harry Potter, and also to the irreverent, mildly anarchic tone of Lego’s most regular collaborator in gaming, the British developer TT Games. One game that does capture this side of Lego is Lego Builder’s Journey, a 2019 puzzle game by Light Brick Studio, which not coincidentally hails from Lego’s native Denmark. Builder’s Journey — which originally debuted on Apple Arcade, the game subscription service from the most Scandinavian company in America — invited players to solve beautiful little brick dioramas by completing their own Lego builds. Light Brick Studio’s followup, Lego Voyagers, expands this notion into a more epic but conventionally structured puzzle-platform adventure. Conventionally structured, that is, apart from the fact that it’s a co-op only game that requires two players to move through it and solve its puzzles, like a minimalist version of Hazelight Studios’ It Takes Two and Split Fiction.

The two players each assume the role of a humble little 1x1 Lego brick, one red and one blue. These tumble around the scene adorably and can execute little jumps, but their key ability is to snap onto any open Lego studs with a press of a button. They can attach to each other, to small platforms or switches, and to loose bricks, creating ungainly shapes which wobble around like a wonky Katamari. They can also slot bricks back down onto the landscape to create structures, often bridges, to help them progress. Building, of course, is another aspect of Lego — the defining aspect — that rarely makes it into games in anything more than the perfunctory “hold button to assemble MacGuffin” form of the TT Games releases. There are two good reasons for this: video games can’t hope to capture the tactility of the real Lego-building experience, and it’s also a serious design challenge to create intuitive, non-fiddly building and camera controls that give players enough freedom to be truly creative. Light Brick gets halfway there, with a simple system that snaps both the player-brick and the brick(s) they are carrying onto a grid, with an extra button to rotate them. But it’s both limited and still quite fiddly; you won’t be constructing anything elaborate in Voyagers. The bricks’ tumbling platforming moves, meanwhile, have an enjoyably haphazard sense of inertia to them, but can be tricky to master. For a game that seems designed primarily for wholesome parent-and-child gaming, Lego Voyagers can be surprisingly tricksy to control.
Still, it’s exquisitely presented, and it plays very smoothly. The two little bricks’ rolling progress through Voyagers’ lovely world of Lego meadows and science installations has a steady momentum that is nicely punctuated by the social satisfaction of communicating with your partner, wordlessly or otherwise, to solve the co-op puzzles. It’s a soothing way to spend time together, which is not a claim that can be made by many multiplayer games, co-op or otherwise. What are the bricks tumbling toward? They love space travel; the game starts with them watching a rocket launch from outside their color-coded houses. The rocket explodes overhead, and its debris opens their path forward, scattering across a landscape that gradually shifts from streams and hillsides to towering gantries and satellite dishes. It seems the plastic friends are headed for the ultimate adventure to the stars. The world, though, is one of gorgeous loneliness, of decorous dilapidation. Who built all this? We never meet another brick who might answer. Nor, during the game’s brief runtime, do we experience any events that might disturb its carefully curated and imperturbable chill (until the end, at any rate). Is there such a thing as too tasteful? Lego Voyagers offers easygoing and guilt-free co-op gaming in an immaculately cool wrapper for the considerate hipster parent (guilty as charged). It’s thoughtful, sincere, and scrupulous in its responsibilities to the essence of both Lego and co-operative play. It’s fun and frictionless, and it won’t cause too many arguments. But when it comes to relationships, to co-operation, and to video games, a little friction is what makes things interesting. Isn’t it? Lego Voyagers will be released Sept. 15 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on PlayStation 5 using a prerelease download code provided by Annapurna Interactive. You can find additional information about Polygon’s ethics policy here.

"little friction is what makes things interesting. Isn’t it?"Not when playing with a 5 year old.
I'm concerned the controls are "tricksy".
I managed to get through a few of the traditional lego games with my kid, but there were a few areas that were tricky, especially in 3D.
Swinging on vines and wall jumping, for example.
I was hoping the snap-to platforming you see in the trailer would smooth this out.
