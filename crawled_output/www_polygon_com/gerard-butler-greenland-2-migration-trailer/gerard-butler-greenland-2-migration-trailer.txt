Director Ric Roman Waugh's post-apocalyptic film Greenland 2: Migration is set to release next year, and from the official trailer, it looks like the Garrity family's problems are just beginning. We last left off during the 2020 film Greenland, which starred Gerard Butler as John Garrity, who, along with his estranged wife, Allison, and their son, Nathan, fled from their home in Atlanta after fragments from an interstellar comet entered Earth's atmosphere. With only 48 hours to reach the underground bunkers in Greenland for safety, the family risked life and limb to get there. And succeeded. Greenland ended on a somewhat hopeful note: the atmosphere left behind after the impact would eventually clear. Perhaps things could return to normal. However, Greenland 2: Migration​​​​, set five years later, reveals that there is no going back to the way things were and that a new normal is arriving: one with continued disastrous weather and, as the trailer revealed, literal balls of fire raining down from the sky. As it turns out, living in a subterranean bunker doesn't do wonders for mental health. John, Alison, and Nathan are all feeling the pressure, and up top, the world isn't looking much better. Even so, the Garritys and the rest of the bunker are sick of just surviving: they want to live again, with clean water and clean air. According to the ones in charge of the bunker, that may be possible. And where is the location of this wondrous place? In southern France, inside the gigantic crater that was left when the world-shattering comet impacted. There's only one thing left to do: get to France. From Greenland. While avoiding radiation storms, literal fireballs, rickety rope bridges, and everything else in between. Will the Garrity family be able to make it to their destination? We'll find out when Greenland 2: Migration hits theaters on January 9, 2026.

So the sequel to the relatively grounded first movie goes fully Roland Emmerich?
