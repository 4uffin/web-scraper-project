Later this week, Magic: The Gathering players from around the world will converge on Atlanta for MagicCon, where the future of the beloved trading card game is set to be unveiled. Kicking off a weekend of tournaments, drafts, and stage shows, the brains behind Magic will take the stage for a special "reveal panel" on Friday, Sept. 26, where they're expected to announce all (or at least some) of the new sets coming in 2026. This will be immediately followed by a Secret Lair panel, where we'll likely see and hear even more about Magic's near future. But it looks like the MTG publisher Wizards of the Coast couldn't wait until Friday to start teasing some news. In an Instagram post on Sept. 22, Wizards of the Coast shared a short animated video of the Shire, the homeland of the Hobbits in the Lord of the Rings franchise, accompanied by the text, "Happy Birthday Mr. Baggins!" This immediately set off a frenzy of speculation among Magic players, who wondered if Wizards was preparing to announce a new LOTR set. The original MTG x Lord of the Rings crossover debuted in 2023 and was a huge hit, confirming to Wizards that its "Universes Beyond" IP mashups were a profitable venture. So it makes sense that the company could double-dip into J.R.R. Tolkien's imagination once again in 2026 or beyond.
What exactly that will look like remains to be seen. The emphasis on the Shire and Biblo Baggins here suggests that Wizards could be prepping a new set of Magic cards inspired by The Hobbit. However, considering that The Hobbit is just one short book, it's hard to imagine there's enough material to fuel an entire new set (or even a mid-sized set like Spider-Man). The more likely option, then, is a Secret Lair drop featuring just a handful of new Hobbit-inspired cards along with some popular older cards re-skinned with LOTR-themed art. Then again, it's also worth noting that Sept. 22 really is Bilbo's birthday. So it's possible Wizards was simply celebrating that date with no ulterior motives — but where's the fun in that? Either way, we'll find our soon enough when MagicCon Atlanta kicks off on Sept. 26.
