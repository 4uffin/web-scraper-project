How to use the Shark Fin in Path of Exile 2
The Shark Fin is a quest item that you'll find as you're exploring the islands in the Karui Archipelago in Path of Exile 2 Act 4. This item drops from the Great White One boss on Whakapanu Island, and, once it’s in your inventory, the “Tribal Medicine” quest will be added to your journal. Since you can’t remove this item from your inventory, completing this quest is crucial to save some inventory space. At the same time, the trouble finding a use for the Shark Fin is worthwhile. In this Path of Exile 2 guide, you will find an explanation of how to use the Shark Fin and complete the “Tribal Medicine” quest.
How to use the Shark Fin in Path of Exile 2
To complete the “Tribal Medicine” quest in Path of Exile 2, you need to visit Kaimana on Ngakanu, which is the first island to the south of Kingsmarch.

We completed the quest line on Whakapanu Island in its entirety before searching for a way to use the Shark Fin, but you can get the huge item out of your inventory almost immediately after defeating the Great White One. Teleport back to Kingsmarch and talk to Makoru who can be found on the boat. Choose the option to “Set Sail” and select Ngakanu as your next destination. When you land on shore, enter the village and go to your right to find Kaimana.

However, if you cannot give Kaimana the Shark Fin on Ngakanu, you may need to complete the "The Search" quest, which does mean you might have to complete Act 4 before getting rid of the quest item. After you complete the Act, you can find Kaimana in Kingsmarch, where she can be found on a boat southwest of the one that you used to sail around the Karui Archipelago. By delivering the Shark Fin to her, Kaimana will let you choose between an Uncut Skill Gem (level 11), an Uncut Spirit Gem (level 11), and an Uncut Support Gem (level 4). You can only pick one, so choose wisely!
