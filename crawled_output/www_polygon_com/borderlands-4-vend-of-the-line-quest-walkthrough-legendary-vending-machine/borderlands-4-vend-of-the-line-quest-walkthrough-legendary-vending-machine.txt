The “Vend of the Line” side quest in Borderlands 4 takes you on a treasure hunt to find the Legendary Vending Machine, which only has legendary guns and gear to sell. Before you can get your hands on these valuable prizes, you need to investigate other machines and learn the coordinates that will take you to where this special machine is hidden. In our Borderlands 4 guide, you learn how to complete the “Vend of the Line” side quest, along with where to find the codes of each vending machine and where to find the Legendary Vending Machine.
‘Vend of the Line’ quest location in Borderlands 4
To start the “Vend of the Line” quest, you must speak with Penelope Streams, who isn't physically present, but you'll find a drone with a projection of her head beside a vending machine in Carcadia. Head northwest from the Carcadia waypoint to easily find her.

“Vend of the Line” has a normal difficulty level and rewards you with experience points, money, and a legendary weapon. Since you need to visit different locations to complete this quest, you may want to see what else you can do in these areas by checking our interactive map and not wasting the trip.
‘Vend of the Line’ quest walkthrough in Borderlands 4
This side quest is structured like a treasure hunt. You will have to find five vending machines and input the “right code” for you to progress in the quest. You input codes by selling (when there is a dollar sign with a slash), or buying (when there is no slash over the dollar sign) guns or pieces of gear in a certain order and of a certain rarity. The rarity is indicated by the color of each dollar sign — green for uncommon, blue for rare, purple for epic, and orange for legendary. To complete this quest, you will need to sell equipment and guns that range from uncommon to legendary, so be sure to have at least two of each rarity in your inventory. After talking to Penelope Stream to unlock the quest and to the first Vault Gatherer beside her, it’s time to go after your treasure.
First vending machine
Right where you meet Penelope Streams, you'll find the first vending machine that you need to investigate. When the quest goal changes to "Inspect Machine," go behind the vending machine to find the code, which is green, green, blue, and blue.

You need to sell two green (uncommon) and then two blue (rare) items to complete this stage. After having cracked the code, the location of the other three vending machines will appear on your map. Head to the nearest one in the southwest of Carcadia.
Second vending machine
The second machine is on the upper floor of a building southwest of Carcadia. If you don't have one purple, one green, and two blue pieces of equipment on you, consider defeating enemies along the way to get some drops or purchasing some from any of the vending machines found in the silos and safehouses.

Before you can find the code for this second machine, you need to turn it on by using a power generator located in the upper section of the same building. After concluding this segment, you need to look for a way to check the back of the machine to learn the code. To see the back of the machine, climb the small structure beside the vending machine and jump over the wall to reach the other side. There’s a small opening in the wall that lets you see the code, which is green, purple, blue, and green.

All the dollar signs in this code don’t have a slash over them, so this means you need to buy the items. However, when you interact with the machine, it doesn’t have items to sell. To fix that, you need to sell one green, one purple, one blue, and one green item, and use the “Buyback” option to buy them, following the same order as indicated by the code.
Third vending machine
The third machine is southeast of the second one in a small camp called Crumblehall. Head southwest inside the camp to find this next vending machine lying over a man on the ground.

Unlike the previous machines, this one won’t require you to sell or buy weapons. You just need to find the code by following the arrows that are on the back part of the vending machine. First, climb the stairs to the west of the vending machine and jump from the upper part to a broken ladder. Next, go all the way around following the higher platform until you reach a window with an arrow pointing to it. Inside, you will find the code for the third machine, which is purple, purple, orange, orange.

While you don’t need to sell or buy anything, you need to wait to see what destiny has in store for the poor man under the vending machine before you proceed to the last one.
Fourth vending machine
The fourth vending machine is found to the south in the Lopside region. If you have unlocked the Makeshift Chalet Safehouse, teleport to it and head east toward the vending machine.
Graphic: Paulo Kawanishi/Polygon | Source images: Gearbox Software/2K Games via Polygon
Before you can interact with the machine, you need to hit the machine with a melee attack. To make the Vault Gatherer Scout leave, you can either hit them with a melee attack or shoot the machine. Regardless, your next step is to find the fourth code.
Graphic: Paulo Kawanishi/Polygon | Source images: Gearbox Software/2K Games via Polygon
To look at the back of the vending machine, crouch and use the opening on the left side of the machine to enter the building. Turn right to find the code, which is green, purple, blue, and purple. Sell items of these colors to the machine and head to the final vending machine.
Fifth vending machine
Although this fifth vending machine is located east of Carcadia, you need to use the main road to the south to reach it. The Rustical Hurl Silo is the closest fast travel point to the road. From there, go northeast, following the main road to reach the Dusty Dangler area.
Graphic: Paulo Kawanishi/Polygon | Source images: Gearbox Software/2K Games via Polygon
This area is protected by a few enemies, which is good because you need guns to sell this time. The vending machine can be found on the building's porch. You just need to jump behind it to see the code: green, blue, purple, and orange.

Again, you need to sell items of these colors, starting with green and ending with orange. Once you complete this task, it’s finally time to find the Legendary Vending Machine.
Where to find the Legendary Vending Machine in Borderlands 4
The Legendary Vending Machine is located on the northeast side of the Dusty Dangler area, next to where you found the fifth vending machine. Once you input the last code, the game will indicate that you should follow the “powered wire”. It will take you to the lower part of the area where a group of Vault Gatherers are opening a door.

When the place becomes accessible, head inside and follow the path until you find an arena with a vending machine. A quick dialogue precedes a fierce encounter against the violent Vend Zane, a vending machine with guns and, instead of selling them, it will shoot you with them.

This is a simple boss encounter, but you must be careful when the boss starts to drop smaller bomb-machines. Kill it, and you can finally claim a new legendary item for your collection.

When you interact with the machine, you can buy any of the items offered by it for only one cash. Considering how expensive legendary guns are in Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine, these items are basically free. Think carefully about which item you want, because you can only pick one, the quest ends, and you can’t access the machine again. Do you need more help with Borderlands 4? For those who are new to Kairos, check out our beginner’s guide before you get started and our best classes guide to find the right one for your playstyle. If you want to have fun with your weapons, be sure to read our guide on how to get more SDU tokens. We know that traversing the immense map of Kairos is a challenge in itself, so you should prioritize unlocking a vehicle, as well as fast travel points. And if you're already enjoying the endgame of Borderlands 4, don’t forget to check the weekly reset time for all current challenges.

Be mindful that you can buy any weapon, including DLC ones... without possesing the DLC.Meaning that you'll have a superb legendary that you can't equip. also the weapons sells for nothing (11$ in my case)

What ever you do make sure you only click the buy option. Otherwise you will lose out on the chance to buy anything
