As of September 23, 2025, there have been a total of 1,514 confirmed* measles cases reported in the United States. Among these, 1,493 measles cases were reported by 42 jurisdictions: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. A total of 21 measles cases were reported among international visitors to the U.S.
There have been 40 outbreaks** reported in 2025, and 86% of confirmed cases (1,307 of 1,514) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated.
*CDC is aware of probable measles cases being reported by jurisdictions. However, the data on this page only includes confirmed cases jurisdictions have notified to CDC.
**CDC reports the cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the U.S.; states have the most up-to-date information about cases and outbreaks in their jurisdictions.

MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners by school year (2009–2024)
The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is very safe and effective. When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated (coverage >95%), most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity). However, vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners has decreased from 95.2% during the 2019–2020 school year to 92.7% in the 2023–2024 school year, leaving approximately 280,000 kindergartners at risk during the 2023–2024 school year. To dive into vaccine coverage data for MMR, visit VaxView.
At local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people in the United States, outbreaks can occur.
What to know about measles cases & outbreak data
How does CDC collect and report data on measles cases and outbreaks?
State, local, tribal, and territorial health departments lead measles case and outbreak investigations. States notify CDC of measles cases reported in their jurisdictions and may request appropriate assistance from CDC to help with their investigations.
On this page CDC publishes:
National measles case counts, including the total number of measles cases reported among international visitors to the United States.
Demographic and clinical data using the national total.
The number of confirmed measles cases among U.S. residents in each jurisdiction.
The cumulative number of measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more related cases) that have occurred this year in the United States.
Why is there more measles activity?
Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. This was thanks to a very high percentage of people receiving the safe and effective measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In recent years, however:
U.S. national MMR coverage among kindergarteners has decreased and is now below the 95% coverage target—with much lower coverage in some communities.
Global measles activity is increasing, meaning more chances of an unvaccinated person infected with measles abroad returning to the United States.
Measles is not a seasonal virus. However, measles is often spread over times of high travel (like spring break, summer, or during holidays) or in situations where unvaccinated persons are in close quarters (like summer camp).

History of Measles
Where are there current outbreaks of measles in the United States?
CDC publishes the cumulative number of measles outbreaks, defined as 3 or more related cases, that have occurred in the United States. Some states may have had multiple measles outbreaks, and a single reported multistate outbreak may have related cases reported in several states. States have the most up-to-date information about cases and ongoing outbreaks in their jurisdictions.
How do measles outbreaks happen in the United States?
Measles is very contagious. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been. While measles has been eliminated in the United States since 2000, it is still common in many parts of the world.
Every year, measles is brought into the United States by travelers who get measles while they are in other countries. Travelers who are infected with measles can bring it back to the United States and spread it to other people who are not protected. These travelers are usually unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally. Far less frequently, they are international visitors. Few cases this year have been reported among international visitors.
A measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more related cases. Most outbreaks in the United States are small, comprised of 6 people or fewer, usually within a household. When measles gets into a community that has lower vaccination rates it can spread quickly, causing larger outbreaks.

Plan for Travel
Why are some vaccinated people getting measles?
Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, 1 dose is 93% effective. It is uncommon for someone who is vaccinated to develop measles. However, breakthrough infections (when someone becomes infected after they have been vaccinated) can occur, especially in communities experiencing an outbreak where high levels of measles virus are circulating. The number of breakthrough infections is consistent with what we have seen in previous years (approximately 10% of all measles infections).
How does CDC assess measles outbreak risk?
CDC is creating models to show how measles outbreaks could occur and spread in the United States. These models can be used to help health departments better identify communities at highest risk and manage healthcare resources.

Assessing Measles Outbreak Risk in the United States
How serious is measles?
Measles is an extremely infectious, and potentially severe rash illness. Before the measles vaccine was introduced, an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized and 400–500 people died in the United States each year.

How do I protect myself?
The best way to protect yourself against measles is with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccination, especially if planning to travel.

Measles Vaccination
History of measles cases
Measles was officially eliminated from the United States in 2000, meaning there is no measles spreading within the country and new cases are only found when someone contracts measles abroad and returns to the country. Achieving measles elimination status in the United States was a historic public health achievement. The below figure illustrates how common measles was before vaccines and how vaccine policy enabled elimination.

*2023 data are preliminary and subject to change. †Elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles transmission in a region for ≥ 12 months in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.
