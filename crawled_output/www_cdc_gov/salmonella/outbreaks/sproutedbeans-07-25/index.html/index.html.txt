Recalled food
Chetak LLC Group recalled Deep branded frozen products due to potential contamination with Salmonella. Recalled frozen foods included sprouted mat (moth) and moong (mung) beans, surti undhiu mix, and other fruits and vegetables. These foods are no longer available for sale.
What you should do
Always follow the four steps to food safety to prevent getting sick from Salmonella.
Clean: Wash your hands, utensils, and surfaces often. Rinse fruits and vegetables under running water before eating, cutting, or peeling.
Separate: Keep food that won't be cooked separate from raw meat, poultry, and seafood.
Cook: Use a food thermometer to make sure you have cooked your food to a temperature high enough to kill germs.
Chill: Refrigerate perishable food (food that goes bad) within 2 hours. If the food is exposed to temperatures above 90°F (like a hot car or picnic), refrigerate it within 1 hour. Thaw food in the refrigerator, not on the counter.
Symptoms of Salmonella
Most people infected with Salmonella experience diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps.
Symptoms usually start 6 hours to 6 days after swallowing the bacteria.
Most people recover without treatment after 4 to 7 days.
Some people—especially children younger than 5, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems—may experience more severe illnesses that require medical treatment or hospitalization.
