About the Speakers Bureau
The CDC Speakers Bureau has been in existence since August 1998. It evolved as a means to meet the public's request for first-hand/real-time information on hot topics and emerging public health issues. Since its inception, the Speakers Bureau has received requests from stakeholders around the world such as community organizations, business corporations, and non-profit organizations.
CDC employees from all disciplines volunteer their time to engage communities about the agency's public health impact. The topics span a multitude of health concerns including influenza, emergency preparedness, women's health, obesity, immunizations, and HIV/AIDS. The main focus of each presentation is to communicate information that the audience need to protect their health – through health promotion, prevention of disease, injury and disability, and preparedness for new health threats.
