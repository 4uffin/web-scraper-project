“I believe that LinkedIn Learning had a significant impact on my promotion. I have everything that I need to grow my career in one platform - its almost vital to my success. Without it, I would not be where I am today.”
Quay Eady
Director of Table Games Analytics, MGM Resorts
“LinkedIn Learning has given me confidence - I have a great tool to help me discover and learn anytime, anywhere. My learning experience has become fun and exciting. I am always looking for ways to use LinkedIn Learning throughout the day.”
Feyza (Nur) Göçmen
Talent Acquisition, L&D and Employer Branding Assistant Specialist at Yildiz Holding
“LinkedIn Learning is not only a wonderful learning option for self-guided, curious adult learners, but it is also an amazing flexible tool for us as an organisation to customise specific content at a specific time. LinkedIn Learning gives us the ability to reach a large number of people with focused, impactful content in an extremely efficient manner.”
Joseph Johnson
Global Director of Learning and Development at Godiva Chocolatier
“LinkedIn Learning is a great way to get started with new concepts and technologies. It’s especially interesting for exploring management topics and soft skills. I’ve often found myself spending eight to ten hours a month on the platform, covering a range of different topics.”
Maikel
Data Scientist, TVH
“When it came to finding the right online learning supplier, LinkedIn Learning was light years ahead. Other vendors didn’t come close to the range and accessibility of the content.”
Richard Flood
Learning and Capability Manager at TalkTalk
“We realise that people learn in different ways in the modern workplace, and we are on a journey to innovate what we offer and motivate people to explore what’s available. LinkedIn Learning is a big part of that.”
Johannes Lystbæk
Learning and Development Manager at LEGO
“When it came to training, we wanted something broad. The days of spoon-feeding people training are gone. The days of putting everybody in a classroom are over. We asked. ‘How do we empower people to develop themselves?’”
Danny Ryan
Director of Technical Training at Autodesk
