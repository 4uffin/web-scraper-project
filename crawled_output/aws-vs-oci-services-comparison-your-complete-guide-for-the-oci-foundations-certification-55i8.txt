AWS vs OCI Services Comparison - Your Complete Guide for the OCI Foundations Certification
#cloudcomputing
#oci
#aws
While AWS dominates the cloud market, OCI has been gaining significant traction with its innovative approach to cloud services, competitive pricing, and enterprise-focused solutions.
This comprehensive comparison will help you leverage your existing AWS knowledge to accelerate your OCI Foundations certification journey. Rather than starting from scratch, you'll discover how OCI's services map to familiar AWS counterparts, while understanding the unique advantages and differentiators that make OCI compelling for modern enterprises.

Key OCI Concepts Not in AWS
Compartments
Unique to OCI: Logical groupings for organizing and controlling access to resources
Purpose: Multi-tenancy, billing, and access control
Benefit: Better resource organization than AWS resource groups
Fault Domains
Unique to OCI: Hardware and infrastructure groupings within availability domains
Purpose: High availability within a single availability domain
Benefit: Additional layer of fault tolerance
Bare Metal Instances
OCI Advantage: Direct access to physical hardware
Use Cases: High-performance computing, legacy applications
Benefit: No virtualization overhead
Exam Focus Areas
Critical OCI Differentiators to Remember:
Autonomous Database - Fully self-managing database service
Compartments - Resource organization and access control
Bare Metal Computing - Non-virtualized compute options
Regional Subnets - Subnets span availability domains
Flexible Load Balancer Shapes - Pay for what you need
Integrated Security - Built-in encryption and security services
Cost Model Differences:
OCI: Predictable pricing, no data egress charges for same region
AWS: Complex pricing with various data transfer charges
OCI: Universal credits system for all services
AWS: Service-specific pricing models
Study Tips:
Focus on OCI-specific terminology (VCN vs VPC, Compartments, etc.)
Understand OCI's approach to high availability across fault domains
Know the autonomous capabilities that differentiate OCI
Memorize the core service names and their AWS equivalents
Practice with OCI's always-free tier services
