The web browser has quietly become one of the most critical components of enterprise infrastructure—and one of the most dangerous.
On September 29th at 12:00 PM ET, BleepingComputer and SC Media will co-host a live webinar with browser security experts from Push Security, exploring how modern web browsers have become the primary attack surface for identity-based intrusions, SaaS abuse, and session hijacking.
The webinar "Your Browser Is the Breach: Securing the Modern Web Edge" will explore the evolving threat landscape targeting corporate browsers and reveal how attackers compromise accounts, steal data, and bypass traditional defenses—all from within the browser itself.
Push Security offers a real-time detection and response platform built for the browser, where identity attacks actually happen. Their technology gives security teams the visibility and control they need to detect risky behavior, protect SaaS sessions, and defend against credential compromise.
In this must-watch webinar, you'll learn how attackers are targeting browsers with malicious extensions, session token theft, OAuth abuse, and shadow extensions—alongside emerging threats like ClickFix and FileFix attacks—and what security teams can do to stop them.
Modern browsers now handle everything from authentication to sensitive SaaS data—and attackers have taken notice.
From phishing kits that harvest session tokens to stealthy extensions that evade detection, browser-based threats are growing rapidly. Traditional endpoint and identity tools often miss these attacks entirely, leaving dangerous gaps in enterprise defenses.
The upcoming webinar will cover:
How the browser became a high-value endpoint and attack surface
Common tactics for browser-based compromise, including extension abuse and session hijacking
Real-world strategies to detect malicious browser activity and close security control gaps
How to protect SaaS sessions and restore visibility at the web edge
The event will be hosted by Adrian Sanabria and browser security experts from Push Security.
Don't miss this opportunity to gain real-world insight into today's browser-based threats and learn how to take back control of your web edge.
