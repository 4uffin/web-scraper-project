Verified Steam game steals streamer's cancer treatment donations

A gamer seeking financial support for cancer treatment lost $32,000 after downloading from Steam a verified game named BlockBlasters that drained his cryptocurrency wallet.
BlockBlasters is a 2D platformer that was available on Steam for almost two months, between July 30 and September 21. The game was safe until August 30, when a cryptodrainer component was added.
Published by developer Genesis Interactive and no longer on Steam, the retro-styled game was a free-to-play title promising fast-paced action on responsive controls, and had a few hundred ‘Very Positive’ reviews on the gaming platform.
The malicious component in the game was revealed during a live fundraising from video game streamer Raivo Plavnieks, a.k.a. RastalandTV, who was trying to raise funds for life saving treatment against stage 4 high-grade sarcoma.
"For anybody wondering what is going on with $CANCER live stream... my life was saved for whole 24 hours untill someone tuned in my stream and got me to download verified game on @Steam," Plavnieks said.
The gamer also started a GoFundMe crowdsourcing campaign to receive donations. At the time of writing, completion of the goal is at 58%. However, some members of the crypto community offered to cover the loss. Crypto influencer Alex Becker said that he sent Rastaland $32,500 to a safe wallet.
As the Latvian gamer explains, he lost more than $32,000 after downloading a verified game on Steam.

Crypto investigator ZachXBT told BleepingComputer that the attackers appear to have stolen a total of $150,000 from 261 Steam accounts.
VXUnderground security group, who has also been following the attack, reports a higher victim count of 478, and published a list of usernames, urging their owners to immediately reset their passwords.
Reportedly, these people were explicitly targeted after being identified over Twitter for managing significant cryptocurrency amounts, and were presumably sent invitations to try out the game.
A group of researchers published a brief report detailing the dropper batch script that performs environment checks before it collects Steam login information along with the victim’s IP address, and uploads the data to a command and control (C2) system.
GDATA researcher Karsten Hahn also documented a Python backdoor, and a StealC payload, used alongside the batch stealer.

Investigators also highlighted an operational security failure where the attackers left their Telegram bot code and tokens exposed.
There are unconfirmed reports that OSINT experts participating in the hunt identified the threat actor as an Argentinian immigrant living in Miami, Florida.
BleepingComputer has contacted Valve for a comment on BlockBlasters and the alleged inaction following multiple reports, but we have not received a response by publication time.
The BlockBlasters incident is not an isolated one on Steam. Similar cases earlier this year include the Chemia survival crafting game, Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution, and PirateFi, all of which infected unsuspecting victims with information-stealing malware.
If you have installed BlockBlasters on your computer, it is recommended to reset your Steam passwords immediately and move your digital assets to new wallets.
In general, it is advisable to be cautious with Steam games that have a small number of downloads and reviews, and also titles in ‘beta’ development stage, as those can hide malware payloads.

VXUnderground reported the rightful and correct action taken, in the absence of action by Valve and others:https://t.me/vxunderground/7219
In short words: OSINT allowed to identify the malicious migrant behind (Citation from VXU: "People are asking how the OSINT nerds found the guy that drained the cancer bro.
Well, it's very shrimple
The shitty malware sent all the stolen data to a Telegram the scammers made.
We connected to the Telegram channel using the same credentials that were inside of the shitty malware
Inside the channel was the scammer(s)
We got their Telegram IDs
OSINT nerds used their Telegram IDs to see if they were in any other public facing chatrooms.
One of the scammers in there was in several fraud chatrooms. He advertised looking for a video game programmer to make a basic 2D game. He also advertised needing help with some malware stuff.
In a different chatroom he talked about how much he likes skateboarding.
In a different channel he shared his Instagram and was sharing photos of himself next to expensive cars
Then, OSINT nerds looked at his Instagram which had a LinkTree. His LinkTree linked to literally everything about the guy including his YouTube, PayPal, Kick, Twitter, etc.
So either he is a master of disguise, and ran a year long detrace campaign to throw off OSINT nerds in the event he's caught scamming
Or alternatively, he wasn't aware public Telegram chatrooms are public and could be searched easily.", END OF CITATION)
and reported the bastard to ICE. Farewell, Argentinian prince.
