In today’s fast-paced digital environment, cybersecurity is no longer optional - it’s essential. Vulnerability management has become a core component of every security strategy and keeping track of vulnerability alerts is an issue facing many businesses.
It doesn’t take much for even a small business to have hundreds, if not thousands of software across their systems. With nearly 10% of vulnerabilities exploited in 2024, a business could easily have dozens of possible breaches in the offing if immediate remediation doesn’t occur.
Tracking every vulnerability update, alert and notification manually can be daunting and time-consuming. The last thing security officers and teams want is to be bombarded with vulnerability information. They require a service that saves them time and delivers relevant and actionable vuln info to them as soon as possible.
Traditional vulnerability management products are often expensive, complex, and difficult to implement, which acts as a barrier for businesses lacking either the security budget or teams. Not everyone needs a suite of products. Even when vulnerability alerts are catered for, there is the possibility of having to login to a product and search for the information.
Use filters to reduce the noise, so you receive relevant vulnerabilities.​​​​
Delivering What You Need
An alternative to offering a suite of products is to provide one streamlined, easy-to-use, affordable service.
SecAlerts does just that. It saves valuable time by delivering vulnerability alerts directly to you as soon as the information is released. Other services often rely solely on NVD and pass on any delays - often lengthy - that may occur. SecAlerts avoids wait times by using 100+ sources, including vendors, researchers, forums, and blogs, to provide up-to-the-minute vulnerability alerts.
Noise is one issue facing security personnel, who often have to wade through a mountain of vulnerability information. Spending time finding vulnerabilities that need to be dealt with can lead to delays updating software, leaving businesses open to attack.
SecAlerts allows you to filter out the noise, so you only receive vulnerability alerts you want to see. If, for example, you want to view critical Microsoft vulnerabilities with a CVSS of 8 - 10 that have been exploited in the past week, you can.
Create Alerts to notify you about new vulnerabilities matching your search criteria
Secure Your Business with SecAlerts’ Instant Vulnerability Alerts
Tracking vulnerabilities is no longer an issue! SecAlerts filters out the noise and delivers relevant, actionable, up-to-the-minute vulnerability alerts directly to you in a range of affordable plans.

How SecAlerts Works
SecAlerts breaks down the process of receiving vulnerability information into three core components – Stacks, Channels and Alerts:
Stacks: Upload your software to SecAlerts from multiple endpoints, code repositories or a custom collection. This can be done manually, via a file (CSV, XLSX, SPDX) or a local scan (npm or curl), which runs a script on your endpoint and builds an SBOM.
Channels: Choose who in your business receives the vulnerability information and how it is received – e.g. Email, Slack, Teams, Webhook.
Alerts: Bring together your Stacks and Channels, so that the right people in your business receive relevant vulnerability information, delivered directly to them at a frequency of their choosing. It's here that you can reduce the noise with one or more filters, including Severity, Known Exploited, EPSS and Trending.
The Dashboard lets you see your vulnerability information in one location
Your Dashboard
Once you’ve added your software, all the relevant vulnerability information will populate your client Dashboard where, as well as your Stacks, Channels and Alerts, you can also see:
Vulnerabilities affecting your software over any period of time you choose.
Extended data for each vulnerability, including its origin e.g. Mitre, Github.
Which software and versions have been affected.
Reference links for each vulnerability.`
Our filters further allow you to edit down your vulnerabilities, so you only view the ones relevant to you.
If you look after e.g. several departments within your business, each with their own software, Properties is where you can give each department their own “page”, with Stacks, Channels, Alerts unique to them.
Properties is especially popular with MSPs wanting to handle their clients in one place.
Each Property contains its own vulnerability information, including Stacks, Channels and Alerts.
Game-Changer
SecAlerts’ global client-base covers five continents and a wide range of industries and businesses, including universities, intelligence agencies, startups, banks, government departments, aviation and cyber insurers.
Many of these businesses incorporate SecAlerts into their cyber security arsenal alongside other products, due to its easy-to-use functionality and the ability to filter out the noise and deliver relevant, actionable, up-to-the-minute vulnerability alerts directly to them – all at an affordable price.
"Staying ahead of vulnerabilities is critical and SecAlerts has been an absolute game-changer," shared a UK customer. "It provides real-time alerts on security threats based on our requirements, helping us proactively address risks before they become major issues. We’ve strengthened our security posture and improved response times significantly."
Try our free 30-day trial and use the code BLEEPING25 when you pay to receive 50% off a one-year SecAlerts subscription.
