Windows 11 23H2 Home and Pro reach end of support in 60 days

Microsoft has reminded customers today that devices running Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 23H2 will stop receiving updates in November.
Enterprise and Education editions will continue to receive mainstream support for an additional year, until November 10, 2026, as stated on the Windows release health dashboard.
"On November 11, 2025, Windows 11, version 23H2 (Home and Pro editions) will reach end of servicing. The November 2025 monthly security update will be the last update available for these editions," Microsoft said in a message center update on Friday.
"After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats."
Windows 11 23H2 users are advised to upgrade their systems to Windows 11 24H2 (also known as the Windows 11 2024 Update), the latest version of Windows 11, which became generally available to eligible Windows 11 22H2/23H2 devices in October 2024, following its rollout to Windows Insider enterprise customers in May 2024.
However, before proceeding with the upgrade, it's important to note that Microsoft has implemented multiple Windows 11 24H2 safeguard holds for devices with incompatible Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) audio drivers, SenseShield Technology code-obfuscation drivers, wallpaper customization software, integrated cameras, and Dirac audio improvement software.
Steam's Hardware & Software Survey shows that as of July 2025, 59.9% of gamers are using Windows 11, with 35.1% still on Windows 10, while Statcounter Global Stats indicates that three years after its October 2021 launch, Windows 11 has finally surpassed Windows 10, with over 53% of Windows systems running it, compared to 42% on Windows 10.
In July, Microsoft also reminded users that the last supported Windows 11 22H2 editions will reach their end of servicing on October 14.
You can find more details about Windows end-of-service dates on the Windows Lifecycle FAQ page or using the Lifecycle Policy search tool. Microsoft also provides a list of products that will be retired or reach the end of support soon.

Im still using Win10 22H2 enterprise, and will continue to do so untill its LTSC runs out.
Win11 is still a complete garbage fire, and no where near reliable enough.

All my computers are on 23H2. 24H2 is garbage. Hopefully 25H2 fixed all the 24H2 issues.
