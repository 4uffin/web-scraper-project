Microsoft: Office 2016 and Office 2019 reach end of support next month

​​​​​Microsoft reminded customers again this week that Office 2016 and Office 2019 will reach the end of extended support in less than 30 days, on October 14, 2025.
Redmond also advised organizations using Visio 2016/2019, Project 2016/2019, and related apps to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid security, compliance, and performance issues since they will also reach the end of support next month.
According to the company's product lifecycle website, Office 2016 reached the end of mainstream support five years earlier, in October 2020, while Office 2019 reached it in October 2023.
"As previously communicated here and MC1056260 (April '25), support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 will end on October 14, 2025. After that date, no further updates, security fixes, or technical support will be available for these versions of Office," the company said in a Microsoft 365 message center update on Tuesday.
"While the applications may continue to function, using unsupported software could lead to potential security risks, compliance risks, system incompatibilities, and other issues."
This week's reminder follows another one issued in April, urging users to migrate to Microsoft 365 Apps, a subscription-based version of the Microsoft Office productivity suite. Redmond's support website offers detailed guidance for upgrading from older Office versions to Microsoft 365 Apps.
Those who want a standalone Microsoft Office release can also switch to Office 2024, which was released in October 2024 for small businesses and home users without Microsoft 365 subscriptions and includes locked-in-time versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook for Windows and macOS systems.
Another option is Office LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) 2024, released by Microsoft in September 2024, a volume-licensed, perpetual version of Office for Windows and macOS designed for government and commercial customers with devices that come without internet connectivity and require long-term support, such as specialty systems like medical equipment.
Microsoft will provide four additional years of support for Office 2024 and Office LTSC 2024, extending the support period until October 9, 2029.
Last week, the company also reminded customers that Windows 10 will reach its end of support in 30 days, and cautioned IT administrators to decommission outdated Exchange 2016 and Exchange 2019, which will also stop receiving security updates starting next month.
