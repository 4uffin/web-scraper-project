Microsoft lifts Windows 11 update block after face detection fix

Microsoft has removed a compatibility hold that prevented devices with integrated cameras from installing Windows 11 24H2 due to a face detection bug causing app freezes.
The issues were triggered when using the Camera app, Windows Hello with facial recognition sign-in options, and other apps that utilize the integrated camera on affected PCs.
"After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, certain devices might experience problems using the integrated camera in scenarios where object or face detection features are enabled," Redmond said when it confirmed the bug almost one year ago, in October 2024.
The update block hold (safeguard ID: 53340062) was added to prevent customers from installing the Windows 11 2024 Update on affected devices and has been lifted after Microsoft fixed the bug causing the compatibility issues.
"Eligible devices with no other safeguard hold should now be able to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel. Please note, it can take up to 48 hours before the update to Windows 11, version 24H2 is offered. Restarting your device might help it offer faster," Microsoft noted in a Windows release health dashboard update.
"We recommend you install the latest security update for your device as it contains important improvements and issue resolutions, including this one."
One week ago, the company removed another safeguard hold that was blocking Windows 11 24H2 upgrades due to compatibility issues, which were causing Bluetooth headsets and speakers to malfunction.
Although Microsoft has lifted multiple other compatibility holds since the start of the year, Windows 11 24H2 upgrades are still blocked for Windows devices with wallpaper customization software, incompatible Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) audio drivers, and SenseShield Technology code-obfuscation drivers.
Windows 11 24H2 was released in October 2024 to eligible devices running Windows 11 22H2/23H2, following an initial enterprise testing rollout in May 2024 for customers enrolled in the Windows Insider Release Preview Channel.
