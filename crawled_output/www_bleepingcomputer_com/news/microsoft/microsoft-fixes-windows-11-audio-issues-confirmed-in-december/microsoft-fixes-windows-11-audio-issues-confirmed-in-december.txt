Microsoft fixes Windows 11 audio issues confirmed in December

Microsoft has removed a safeguard hold that prevented some users from upgrading their systems to Windows 11 24H2 due to compatibility issues that were causing Bluetooth headsets and speakers to malfunction.
As the company explained when it acknowledged this bug in December, the issue affected systems with Dirac audio improvement software, which also triggered problems with audio device detection and caused integrated speakers to stop functioning.
"The incompatibility relates to the software component cridspapo.dll, which is part of these devices' audio processing software," Microsoft said in December.
"After installing Windows 11, version 24H2, some users reported that their device's integrated speakers, Bluetooth speakers, and Bluetooth headsets stopped functioning. They also reported that both first-party and third-party applications didn't recognize these devices."
On Friday, almost nine months after confirming the bug, Microsoft announced that it has now lifted the update block preventing Windows 24H2 upgrades on Windows devices with Dirac audio software.
While it may take several days before the upgrade to Windows 11, version 24H2 is offered, affected users can restart their device, which may cause the upgrades to speed up this process.
"A new version of the driver has been made available via Windows Update, which addresses this issue. We recommend you install the latest security update for your device as it contains important improvements and issue resolutions, including this one," the company said.
"The safeguard hold has been removed as of September 11, 2025. Eligible devices with no other safeguard hold should now be able to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."
Windows 11 24H2 was released to eligible devices running Windows 11 22H2/23H2 in October, following its initial rollout in May 2024 for enterprise testing with customers in the Windows Insider Release Preview Channel.
While Microsoft has lifted other safeguard holds since the start of the year, Windows 11 24H2 upgrades are still blocked for Windows devices with incompatible Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) audio drivers, SenseShield Technology code-obfuscation drivers, wallpaper customization software, and integrated cameras.
