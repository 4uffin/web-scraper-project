OpenAI is testing a new GPT-5-based AI agent "GPT-Alpha"

OpenAI is internally testing a new version of its AI agent, which uses a special version of GPT-5 dubbed "GPT-Alpha."
Earlier today, OpenAI accidentally pushed an unreleased feature to everyone.
As you can see in the above screenshot shared on X, the new feature is called "Agent with Truncation" and it can be found under Alpha Models.
The system prompt of the new GPT-Alpha agent confirmed that the agent is designed to execute the following features:
Browse the web for up-to-date/niche information
Generate and edit images
Write, run, and debug code
Create/edit documents, spreadsheets, and slides Constraints.
Do not access or expose private info unless explicitly provided
The internal prompt also confirms that it's an agent that uses "GPT-5 for Advanced Reasoning and Tool Use."
It's unclear when the new Agent will begin rolling out, but Sam Altman previously confirmed that OpenAI plans to ship advanced features for paid customers only due to the requirement of additional compute.
This new agent could be one of those premium features for ChatGPT, at least intially.
