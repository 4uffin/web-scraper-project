ChatGPT now gives you greater control over GPT-5 Thinking model

OpenAI is finally rolling out a toggle that allows you to decide how hard the GPT-5-thinking model can think.
This feature is rolling out to Plus and Pro subscribers.
OpenAI has been testing the toggle for several weeks now. Previously, OpenAI planned to ship a slider, but it has now opted for a simple toggle for controlling thinking model.

As you can see in the above screenshot, toggle allows you to select GPT-5 Thinking with different reasoning effort levels. The effort levels are internally called "juice" values.
For example, GPT-5-Thinking is set to a level of 18 when you're using Standard. This is the default balancing speed and intelligence.
Finally, you have Extended, which has a level of 64.
In the case of Pro, you can also choose Light, which has a juice level of 5, and is very instant. But if you're looking for deeper thinking, you can use Heavy, which has a level of 200, the maximum you can get out of GPT-5-Thinking model.
These models are available to Plus and Business users, while Pro users get Light and Heavy as well.
