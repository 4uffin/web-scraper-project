OpenAI's new GPT-5 Codex model takes on Claude Code

OpenAI is rolling out the GPT-5 Codex model to all Codex instances, including Terminal, IDE extension, and Codex Web (chatgpt.com/codex).
Codex is an AI agent that allows you to automate coding-related tasks. You can delegate your complex tasks to Codex and watch it execute code for you.

Even if you don't know programming languages, you can use Codex to "vibe code" your apps and web apps.
But so far, it has fallen a bit short of Claude Code, which is the market leader in the AI coding space.
Today, OpenAI confirmed it's rolling out the Codex-special GPT-5 model.
In a blog post, OpenAI stated the GPT-5 Codex model excels in real-world coding tasks, achieving a 74.5% success rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark.
In code refactoring evaluations, it improved from 33.9% with GPT-5 to 51.3% with GPT-5-Codex.
GPT-5-Codex is still rolling out. I don't see it on my Terminal yet, even though I pay for ChatGPT Plus ($20).
OpenAI says it will be fully rolled out to everyone in the coming days.
