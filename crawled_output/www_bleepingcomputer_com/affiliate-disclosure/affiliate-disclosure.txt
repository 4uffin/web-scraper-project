Affiliate Disclosure
If you purchase products through the links on our site, we may earn a commission. Read below to learn more about affiliate links and how we use them.
Full disclosure
The Federal Trade Commission requires that we disclose any relationship between a product manufacturer or advertiser when we write about a product, service, or recommend a product. BleepingComputer agrees with this policy as it allows you, the reader, to understand the relationships between a site and the various companies and products they promote.
Editorial integrity has always been and will remain the cornerstone of BleepingComputer's philosophy and commitment to its readers. Our journalists and staff writers strive to provide unbiased and accurate news, reviews and guides that serve the interests of our readership and our community.
In order to help fund this great work, we will sometimes use affiliate links within our content.
With that said, it is important to note that these affiliate relationship have no influence over how our journalists report the news or provide information on cybersecurity and technology.
What is an affiliate link?
Quite simply, if a user decides to purchase a product or service via one of the links in an article, we may receive a small commission.
We will always clearly identify articles that contain affiliate links. Purchasing a product or service via BleepingComputer in no way impacts the price you pay and, in fact, it may often be cheaper than if you decide to purchase it directly from the provider.
For nearly 20 years, BleepingComputer has remained a stalwart provider of accurate and relevant cybersecurity and IT news. By purchasing products and services via our site, you are directly contributing to the future success of BleepingComputer. It costs you nothing, but it means everything to us. Thank you for your ongoing support.
How we use affiliate links
VPN and Antivirus reviews and guides
BleepingComputer offers a wide range of guides and reviews on VPN and antivirus products.
This content will include affiliate links to vendor sites that generate a commission for BleepingComputer.
It should be noted that this content and the writers behind it are completely siloed from and have no influence over BleepingComputer's news reporting.
Forums
In the forums, we use SkimLinks to automatically transform posted links into affiliate links. If you do not wish to view inserted links, you can opt out of this process by going to this URL: http://optout.skimlinks.com/?tested=1.
Virus Removal Guides
In our Virus Removal section, we offer guides on how to remove various computer infections. These guides may use programs and utilities that generate commissions for the site when you purchase them. We will never, though, promote a product for the sole purpose of generating a commission.
We will only suggest a product that can actually help you remove the computer infection for free, and we will only receive a commission if you decide to purchase it after. If it is required that you purchase a product before you can remove an infection, and we receive a commission for it, we will specifically state this in the guide. The products that we routinely use in our guides and that we receive affiliate commissions from are MalwareBytes, Emsisoft, Zemana, and HitmanPro.
Download Section
All of the programs in our Download section are fully functional and free to use. If you use the product and decide to purchase it, we may earn a commission for the sale, depending on the software.
Tutorial Section
Some tutorials may discuss or require specific hardware or software that contain Amazon affiliate links that will generate a commission for the site if you purchase
them.
StackCommerce and the BleepingComputer.com Deals Store
BleepingComputer.com has partnered with StackCommerce to offer our readers deals on a variety of products. If a user chooses to purchase a product through this store, BleepingComputer.com will earn a commission on the sale.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these policies, please free to contact us here: https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/contact/
