BleepingComputer Review:
Qualys BrowserCheck is a cloud service that lets you check if your browser and installed plugins are all up-to-date so that you not affected by security vulnerabilities in outdated browser technology.
This browser plugin is used in conjunction with a native Windows or macOS application that enables the scanning of plugins and browsers to make sure that everything is up-to-date.
On modern operating systems, BrowserCheck can also check if your Windows or macOS device has the latest security updates installed to make sure that your operating system is not exposed to vulnerabilities.
When using Qualys BrowserCheck you can perform one of three types of scans:
Basic Scan: Makes sure the browser and installed plugins are using the latest version.
Intermediate Scan: Scans browsers and OS settings.
Advanced Scan: Scans browsers, OS settings, and makes sure the latest Windows Updates are installed.
In BleepingComputer's tests, the Advanced Scan provided the most information with little waiting time, so it is suggested to use that setting when performing scans.
