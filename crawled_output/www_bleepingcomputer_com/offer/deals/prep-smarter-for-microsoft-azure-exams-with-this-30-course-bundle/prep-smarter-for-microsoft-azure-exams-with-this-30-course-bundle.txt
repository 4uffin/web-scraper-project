If cloud computing is where your career is headed (or already thriving), Microsoft Azure certification is one of the best ways to stand out. The 2025 Microsoft Azure Architect & Administrator Exam Certification Prep Bundle gives you nine multi-lesson courses and 59 hours of training, covering the skills and knowledge tested on some of Microsoft’s most sought-after exams.
Whether you’re just starting out with Azure or looking to validate years of hands-on experience, this bundle can help. Here are just a few of the nine courses included in this MS Azure Exam Prep Bundle.
AZ-104 Azure Administrator – Covers everything you need to pass the Microsoft AZ-104 exam with 146 lectures in-depth lectures and free updates.
AZ-204 Developing Solutions for Azure – Learn to build, deploy, and scale applications on Azure, complete with practice tests.
