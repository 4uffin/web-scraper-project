Studying for multiple CompTIA certifications can get expensive and messy when you buy separate courses for each exam. The All-in-One CompTIA Certification Prep Courses Bundle gives you a single, budget-friendly library to prepare across the full track, so you can study efficiently without piecing together materials from different places. It’s also on sale for only $24.97 (reg. $299.90), but that price won’t last much longer.
Study for all your CompTIA exams in one place
This bundle brings together prep for the certifications most hiring managers recognize across entry and mid-level roles. You start with ITF+ to ground basic concepts, then move into A+ for hardware, operating systems, and troubleshooting. Network+ covers protocols, devices, and network operations, and Security+ builds foundational security knowledge across threats, controls, and risk. From there, you can branch into focused paths like Linux+, Server+, Cloud Essentials+, Cloud+, PenTest+, and Data+ to match your goals in systems, cloud, security, or analytics.
Each course is organized into short, focused lessons that map to official exam objectives. You get clear explanations of the core topics, walkthroughs and demonstrations where relevant, and practice elements such as quizzes or labs that reinforce recall and problem solving. The coverage spans components and storage, operating systems and virtualization, TCP/IP, routing, switching, wireless, identity and access management, encryption and PKI basics, vulnerability concepts, incident response, cloud models and migration planning, containers and DevOps fundamentals, scripting basics, database and query concepts, and statistics and visualization for exam domains like Data+.
It is important to note that these courses are exam prep, not official certification. You will still have to schedule and pass each CompTIA exam to earn a formal certification, but this is a much more affordable, accessible way to study.
The All-in-One CompTIA Certification Prep Bundle is on sale now for $24.97.
This sale ends October 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT.
Prices subject to change.
