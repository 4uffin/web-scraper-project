Let’s face it: Cybersecurity is a field where standing still often means falling behind. Threats evolve fast, and employers constantly seek candidates with up-to-date skills and certifications. But that doesn’t mean prep materials should have to cost you a fortune.
InfoSec4TC is an online training school with a massive catalog of certification training, including CISSP, CISA, ethical hacking, and more. The InfoSec4TC Platinum e-training package gives you lifelong access to all current and future courses and programs, but the price on their website is quite high. If you’re interested, you can get it now for only $52.97 (reg. $280).
What does it come with?
With this membership, you can access a vast and evolving library of cybersecurity training resources. This isn’t just a static collection of courses; it’s a dynamic platform that grows with the industry and your goals.
You’ll get lifetime access to all current and future courses, ensuring you’re always equipped with the latest knowledge and skills. Currently, you’ll find training for the CSEC, CISSP, ISMS implementation, CISA, and CISM, just to name a few.
Materials include the latest exam questions, extra course materials, free access to the student portal, and the option to join private social media groups. This means you can find community support, network, or just find friends in the industry to connect with.
If you’re still hesitant to make the investment, you can read some of InfoSec4TC’s reviews on Trustpilot. They have an excellent 4.8-star rating, and this one by Zohaib might describe the platform best: “I have been with InfoSec4TC for the last three years and I haven’t found any realistic cybersecurity training on the entire internet except on InfoSec4TC.”
Start or grow your cybersecurity career with lifetime access to the InfoSec4TC Platinum e-learning courses for $52.97 (reg. $280) for a little while longer.
Prices subject to change.
