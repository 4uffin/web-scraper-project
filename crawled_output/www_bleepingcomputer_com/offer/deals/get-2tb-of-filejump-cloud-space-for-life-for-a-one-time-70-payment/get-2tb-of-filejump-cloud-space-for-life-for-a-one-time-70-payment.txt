If you’re juggling files across multiple drives, or paying too much every month for cloud storage, the FileJump platform is an easy, affordable solution that simplifies your digital life. With 2TB of secure cloud space for a one-time price, you can finally store your most important files forever without worrying about hidden fees or storage limits sneaking up on you.
Whether it’s work documents, vacation photos, family videos, or client files, FileJump makes uploading and organizing your content a breeze. The drag-and-drop dashboard keeps things user-friendly, while built-in media previews let you check files on the fly without downloading. And with AES encryption protecting everything, you’ll know your data is safe.
Here’s what you get with FileJump’s lifetime plan:
2TB of lifetime storage – Plenty of space for work, play, and everything in between
Unlimited downloads – Access your files anytime, from anywhere
Drag-and-drop interface – Uploading couldn’t be easier
Preview media and documents – Check spreadsheets, images, videos, and more without downloading
15GB per file upload – Handle large projects, high-res media, and big backups easily
Share and collaborate – Send files with links or give clients/team members secure access
AES encryption – Industry-standard protection to keep your data private
PWA mobile and desktop apps – Access across all your devices seamlessly
Customer support – Help when you need it
Keep your digital world organized for less.
However, it should be noted that while this is a lifetime deal, if the company goes out of business then it would not longer be effective. So, only purchase this deal if you're willing to take that risk.
Don’t miss getting lifetime access to 2TB of FileJump’s cloud space for just $69.97 (MSRP $467) when you order through October 12.
Prices subject to change.
