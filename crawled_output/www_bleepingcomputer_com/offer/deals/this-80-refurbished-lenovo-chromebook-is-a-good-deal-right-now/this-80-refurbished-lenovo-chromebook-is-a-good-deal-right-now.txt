If you need a reliable, budget-friendly device for browsing, streaming, or getting work done, this refurbished Lenovo 300e 2nd Gen 2-in-1 Chromebook is a standout deal at just $79.99. That’s over 70% off its usual retail price of $284.99, but only for a limited time.
Powered by 4GB of RAM and 32GB of eMMC storage, it’s built for fast boot-ups and smooth web browsing. ChromeOS keeps things simple and secure, with automatic updates and built-in protection from viruses and malware—ideal for users who prefer a worry-free, lightweight system.
This compact 11.6-inch Chromebook features a touchscreen display and a 360-degree hinge, so it can easily switch between laptop, tablet, tent, and stand modes. It’s great for casual use, note-taking, or video calls, and the touchscreen adds flexibility whether you’re working or watching.
The 300e is designed to take a few hits, too, regardless if you’re bringing it to and from the office or traveling with it. It has a reinforced hinge, spill-resistant keyboard, and rubber bumpers for extra durability, making it a solid option for students or anyone needing a rugged device for daily use.
Its port selection includes USB-C, USB-A, a microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. You’ll also get access to the Google Play Store, which means Android apps, games, and tools can extend this device’s functionality beyond basic browsing.
Keep in mind that this is a Grade B refurbished unit, which means it may show minor cosmetic signs of use, but it’s been tested and verified to work like new. It also comes with a charger and a 90-day warranty.
Whether you’re outfitting a home setup, grabbing a secondary device, or need something for school or travel, this Lenovo Chromebook delivers serious value for the price.
Refurb deals like this don’t last long—especially under $100. If you’re in the market, now’s the time to lock it in and grab yourself one of these $79.99 2-in-1 Lenovo Chromebooks.
Prices subject to change.

Out of curiosity - specs aside, did the producers finally learned, or do you still cannot install any other OS on those, for some reason?
