Breaking into cybersecurity—or advancing within it—means mastering security and risk management, one of the toughest but most critical domains. The CISSP Security & Risk Management Training Bundle can help you build that foundation, and for a limited time, it’s only $29.97 (MSRP: $424) through Oct. 5.
This bundle packs in eight courses and 21 hours of training, covering critical CISSP domains like Security & Risk Management, Asset Security, and Security Engineering. These aren’t surface-level intros either — they dig into the concepts, frameworks, and methodologies that form the foundation of information security.
Just starting out? You’ll get a clear, structured path into cybersecurity, learning how to protect data, assess risks, and build secure systems. Or maybe you’re already in the field. Use the bundle to brush up on advanced areas like cryptography, risk assessment methodologies, and engineering lifecycle vulnerabilities.
Highlights of the CISSP Security & Risk Management Training Bundle include:
39 lectures on CISSP Domain 1: Security & Risk Management
30 lectures on Asset Security
64 lectures on Security Engineering
35 lectures on Communication & Network Security
19 lectures on Identity & Access Management
10 lectures on Security Assessment & Testing
43 lectures on Security Operations (Advanced)
24 lectures on Security in the Software Development Life Cycle
Lifetime access on desktop or mobile, so you can train on your schedule
This is a budget-friendly way to start (or accelerate) your journey toward CISSP certification—the gold standard in security credentials. And you can revisit the material anytime.
Get lifetime access to the CISSP Security & Risk Management Training Bundle for just $29.97 (MSRP: $424) through Oct. 5.
Prices subject to change.
