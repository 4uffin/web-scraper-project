You don’t need to drop hundreds of dollars to get a solid, reliable tablet. The onn. 11″ Tablet Pro (2023) is proof that you can stay connected, entertained, and productive without paying premium prices. Right now, you can grab it in new, open-box condition for just $74.99—less than half its regular $159 MSRP cost.
This Android 13 tablet delivers a familiar smartphone-like experience, only on a bigger, sharper 11-inch LCD touchscreen (1200×2000 resolution). That means streaming shows, browsing, or reading is crisp and clear. Inside, it runs on a 2.2GHz octa-core processor with 128GB of storage (expandable if you need more), so multitasking feels smooth whether you’re video chatting, working, or gaming.
Battery anxiety? Not anymore. The onn. 11″ Tablet Pro’s 16-hour battery life keeps you going from morning commutes to evening binge sessions without hunting for an outlet. Plus, dual cameras (5MP front and 8MP rear) make it easy to hop on video calls, take selfies, or snap quick photos. Built-in Google Kids Space and Entertainment Space round it out with options for both family-friendly fun and your own downtime.
Because this is a new, open-box deal, the packaging may show light handling, but the device itself has been checked and verified to be in new condition. Think of it like getting new tech at a clearance price.
Whether you want an affordable extra device for travel, a kid-friendly screen for home, or just a lightweight tablet that covers the basics, this Android tablet delivers way more than its price tag suggests.
At this reasonable price, it’s a smart pickup that won’t last long.
Get the new, open-box onn. 11″ Tablet Pro (2023) while it’s just $74.99 (MSRP $159).
Prices subject to change.
