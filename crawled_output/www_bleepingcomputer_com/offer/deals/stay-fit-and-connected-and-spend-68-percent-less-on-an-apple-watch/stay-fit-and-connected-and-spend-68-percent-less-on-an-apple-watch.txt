If you’ve been eyeing an Apple Watch upgrade but can’t stomach the $499 price tag, you should consider a refurbished model. You can grab a refurbished Apple Watch Series 7 (from 2021) for just $154.99. That’s 68% less than retail price, and it still delivers everything you want in a modern watch.
What sets the Series 7 apart? For starters, the larger Always-On Retina display. It’s about 20% bigger than Series 6, with ultra-thin borders and brightness that makes it easier to read indoors. You even get a full QWERTY keyboard on your wrist, so replying to texts or firing off quick notes feels surprisingly natural.
Apple also toughened things up with crack-resistant glass, IP6X dust protection, and WR50 water resistance. It’s more durable than earlier models and ready for gym sweat, a run in the rain, or everyday bumps.
Battery life stays at the all-day 18 hours you’d expect, but now with 33% faster charging. That’s ideal when you need a quick top-up before heading out.
Of course, the Apple Watch Series 7 offers advanced health features like ECG monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, and enhanced fall detection. Paired with workout tracking (including cycling and e-bikes), it’s like having a fitness coach and health monitor right on your wrist.
Yes, this one’s refurbished Grade B, which means it might have a light scratch or scuff or two. But functionally? It’s Apple Watch power, style, and connectivity at a price that feels almost too good to be true.
For anyone who’s been waiting to join the Apple Watch crowd—or upgrade without paying top dollar—this is the move.
Get this refurbished Apple Watch Series 7 while it’s on sale for just $154.99 (MSRP: $499) for a limited time.
Prices subject to change.
