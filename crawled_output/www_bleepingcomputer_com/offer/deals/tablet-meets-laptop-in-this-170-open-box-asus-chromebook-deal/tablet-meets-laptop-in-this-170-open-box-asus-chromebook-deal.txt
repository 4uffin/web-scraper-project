One of the perks of today’s tech world? You don’t have to overpay to get quality gear. Case in point: the open-box ASUS 2-in-1 Chromebook CM30, a versatile little workhorse that can pull double duty as both a laptop and a tablet—all for $169.99 (MSRP $329.99) with free shipping in this limited-time offer.
Powered by the MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, this Chromebook handles everyday tasks like streaming, browsing, and multitasking without a hiccup. Its 10.5-inch WUXGA touchscreen makes navigation smooth and intuitive, while the included detachable keyboard with magnetic stand lets you switch from typing reports to tablet mode in seconds.
Need a stylus? ASUS thought of that, too. The garaged push-pop stylus charges quickly, tucks neatly into the device, and is ready whenever inspiration hits. Dual 5MP cameras mean video calls and quick snapshots are effortless, and with Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth 5.3, you’ll stay connected whether you’re working from home or coffee-shop hopping.
The military-grade aluminum chassis is made with 30 percent recycled materials, so it’s both durable and eco-conscious. Add in up to 12 hours of battery life, and this Asus Chromebook is more than capable of keeping up with your workday (and your Netflix queue).
Features That Stand Out
MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor for smooth performance
10.5″ WUXGA touchscreen with intuitive touch navigation
8GB RAM + 128GB storage for multitasking and files
Garaged push-pop stylus with fast charging
Detachable keyboard + magnetic stand for laptop/tablet flexibility
Dual 5MP front and rear cameras for video calls and quick snaps
12-hour battery life for all-day use
Military-grade aluminum build with eco-friendly recycled materials
Wi-Fi 6 + Bluetooth 5.3 for stable, fast connections
The new, open-box condition means it is new, but might have different packaging, as it’s typically overstock from store shelves.
Get this new, open-box ASUS Chromebook CM30 while it’s just $169.99 (MSRP $329.99) with free shipping.
Prices subject to change.
