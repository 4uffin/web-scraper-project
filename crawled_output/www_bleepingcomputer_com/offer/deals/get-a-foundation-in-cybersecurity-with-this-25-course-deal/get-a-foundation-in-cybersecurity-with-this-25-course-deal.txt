Getting into cybersecurity is easier when you learn the tools, workflows, and standards that real teams use every day. The 2025 Cyber Security Career Foundations Course Bundle pulls those pieces together so you can build a practical base and figure out where you want to specialize. It’s also on sale for only $24.99 (reg. $120).
How to start your cybersecurity education
The bundle starts with core concepts. You cover confidentiality, integrity, availability, common attack types, and the defensive controls that stop them. From there, you move into network basics and the technologies that protect traffic, which helps everything else make more sense. It is a clear on-ramp if you are new to IT, and it also works as a refresher if you are switching roles.
Cloud skills are a major part of modern security, so several courses focus on AWS. You learn how Identity and Access Management works in practice, how to design and audit permissions, and how to think about services like VPC, storage, and monitoring from a security point of view. By the end, you can read policies, reason about least privilege, and recognize the difference between a secure setup and one that needs work.
Incident response gets its own dedicated section with a full look at the lifecycle from detection to recovery. You practice triage, documentation, and post-incident improvement, and you see where tools like ticketing, logging, and dashboards fit into daily operations. Vulnerability management ties in with scanning fundamentals, prioritization, and reporting, so you learn to separate signal from noise and turn findings into fixes.
Programs run on more than tools, so there is also a guided introduction to ISO 27001. You learn how an information security management system functions, what Annex A controls are for, and how governance and risk management support day-to-day security work.
The tech industry is competitive, but a good education can give you a running start.
Right now, you can get the 2025 Cyber Security Career Foundations Bundle on sale for $24.99.
Prices subject to change.
