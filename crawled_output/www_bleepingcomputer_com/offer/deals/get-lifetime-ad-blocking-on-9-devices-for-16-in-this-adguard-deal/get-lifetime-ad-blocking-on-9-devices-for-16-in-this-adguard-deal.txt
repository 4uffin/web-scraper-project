Between pop-ups, autoplay videos, sneaky trackers, and the occasional malware trap, it’s easy to feel like browsing has become a literal minefield. That’s why AdGuard Family Plan is such a game-changer —and you can lock in lifetime access for just $15.97 (MSRP: $169.99) when you use coupon code FAMPLAN at checkout through Oct. 5.
AdGuard does way more than basic ad blocking. Sure, it wipes out banners and disruptive video ads, but it also brings advanced privacy protection to keep trackers from spying on your activity, malware defense to block phishing sites, and even parental controls so kids can browse safely.
A significant feature of the AdGuard Family Plan is that one license covers up to nine devices. That means your phone, your partner’s laptop, your kid’s tablet, and more — all protected without juggling multiple subscriptions. It works across Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, so your entire digital ecosystem is covered.
Because it’s a lifetime plan, you pay once and get ongoing updates forever. No hidden renewals, no monthly bills. Just smooth, secure browsing that actually feels like the internet was meant to.
So if you’re ready to ditch the digital clutter and protect your family’s online life, this is your chance to do it for way less than usual.
Get lifetime access to AdGuard’s Family Plan and cover nine devices for just $15.97 (MSRP: $169.99) with code FAMPLAN.
Prices subject to change.
