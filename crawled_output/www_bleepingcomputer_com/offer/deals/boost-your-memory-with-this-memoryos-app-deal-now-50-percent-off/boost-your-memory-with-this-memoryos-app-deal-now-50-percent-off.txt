With phones storing our contacts, calendars, and passwords, our brains don’t get as much of a workout as they used to. Sometimes it feels like having so much information at our fingertips has made us a little forgetful. That’s why the memoryOS app can really be helpful. And a one-year subscription is on sale for $74.99 (MSRP $149.99).
MemoryOS is a memory training app built on scientifically proven techniques that help improve recall and retention. Instead of generic brain games, it uses methods like mnemonics and spaced repetition—combined with a virtual “Mind Palace”—to train your memory the same way athletes train their muscles. Over 100,000 users have already tested it, and on average, they report a 70% increase in recall ability.
So, how does this memoryOS platform work? Think of the Virtual Mind Palace as your own personal storage system inside the app. You navigate immersive, gamified environments that help you encode and retrieve information more effectively. Want to remember names, exam material, speeches, or even just where you put your keys? These bite-sized lessons give you the tools to store and recall details more easily.
It’s also guided by World Memory Champions, so you’re learning from people who have mastered these techniques at the highest level. Whether you’re a student prepping for finals, a professional memorizing presentations, or a parent just tired of blanking on everyday details, memoryOS helps turn forgetful moments into confident ones.
If information overload has made your memory a little lazy, memoryOS might be the tool your brain has been waiting for.
For a limited time, you can get a 1-year subscription to the memoryOS Expert Plan for $74.99 (MSRP $149.99).
Prices subject to change.
