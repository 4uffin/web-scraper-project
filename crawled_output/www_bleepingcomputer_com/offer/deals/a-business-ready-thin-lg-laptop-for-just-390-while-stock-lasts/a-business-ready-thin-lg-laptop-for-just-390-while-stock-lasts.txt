Looking for a laptop that won’t slow you down—literally or figuratively? The LG Gram 14″ Thin Laptop is built for professionals who need portability, performance, and practicality. And right now, you can grab it for just $389.99 (MSRP $819), which is a 52% savings.
Weighing just 2.2 pounds, the Gram is one of the lightest laptops on the market, making it ideal for commuting, business travel, or simply moving from room to room. Despite its featherweight frame, this machine doesn’t compromise on power.
It’s equipped with an 11th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB NVMe SSD, giving you fast boot times, smooth multitasking, and plenty of storage for apps and files.
The 14-inch WUXGA IPS display (1920×1200) offers extra vertical space compared to standard 1080p, which comes in handy for documents, spreadsheets, and web browsing. Whether you’re streaming, working on presentations, or collaborating online, the visuals are sharp and vibrant.
Add in the built-in HD webcam and speakers, and your video calls won’t just run smoothly—they’ll look and sound professional, too.
Connectivity is another area where the LG Gram laptop shines. With Thunderbolt 4 support, you get lightning-fast data transfer speeds and the ability to connect multiple devices, monitors, or storage solutions. It’s a setup that can adapt to your needs today and expand with you tomorrow.
Unlike traditional consumer laptops, the LG Gram 14 is also Cloud OS–ready and compatible with various virtual desktop infrastructures (VDI), including IGEL. That makes it especially useful in business environments where flexibility and secure remote access matter.
At this price, it hits the sweet spot: lightweight enough to carry all day, powerful enough to handle real work, and discounted enough to make upgrading an easy decision.
Get this new LG Gram 14″ thin laptop while it’s just $389.99 (MSRP $819).
Prices subject to change.
