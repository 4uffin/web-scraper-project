Owning a MacBook Pro has probably been on your wish list for years, but that price tag always stings. $2,899 for a laptop? Brutal. Here’s the good news—you don’t have to pay anywhere near that. Right now, you can grab a like-new Apple MacBook Pro M1 (2021) for just $1,149.99 (MSRP $2,899). That’s a serious 60% off.
We’re talking about Apple’s M1 Pro chip—a beast that combines a 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine to handle everything from everyday multitasking to video editing, gaming, and data-crunching without breaking a sweat. Pair that with 32GB of unified memory and 1TB of SSD storage, and you’ve got yourself a professional-grade workhorse that’ll feel smooth for years.
And because Apple thought of everything, this MacBook Pro M1 is loaded with extras that make daily use a dream:
14.2” Liquid Retina XDR Display: Bright, vivid visuals at 3024×1964 resolution.
Up to 17 hours of battery life: All-day power, no outlet anxiety.
Plenty of ports: HDMI, MagSafe 3, Thunderbolt 4, SD card slot—you name it.
1080p FaceTime camera + six-speaker system: Perfect for calls, music, and streaming.
Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0: Fast, seamless connectivity.
And yes, this one even comes with Apple Intelligence—your personal on-device AI assistant designed to help you write, organize, and stay productive, with top-tier privacy protections built in.
Why Go Refurbished?
This MacBook comes with a Grade A rating, which means it arrives in nearly mint condition. At 3.5 pounds, it’s still sleek, still powerful, and still every bit the MacBook Pro you’ve dreamed about—only this time, it’s actually in your budget.
Get this Grade A refurbished Apple MacBook Pro M1 (2021) for just $1,149.99 (MSRP $2,899) while you can.
