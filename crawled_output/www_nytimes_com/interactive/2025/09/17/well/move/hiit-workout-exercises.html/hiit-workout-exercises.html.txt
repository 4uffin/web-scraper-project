HIIT workouts are so efficient because they alternate short bursts of very intense exercise with even shorter rests. That constant game of catch-up leads to quick cardio gains.
We consulted with fitness experts and trainers to build a tool for creating your own custom workout. By combining a few common exercises — like squats, push-ups and jumping jacks — you can make thousands of different routines. Once you’ve made your workout, our timer will guide you through it.

Remember: Intensity is the key to HIIT, so be ready to push yourself. But if you experience dizziness, unusual heart rhythms or any sharp pain, stop.
