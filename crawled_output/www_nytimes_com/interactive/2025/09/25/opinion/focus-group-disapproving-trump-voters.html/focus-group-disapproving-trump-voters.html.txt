Trump’s Youth Support Has Faded. These 11 Young Trump Voters Explain Why. Trump’s Youth Support Has Faded. These 11 Young Trump Voters Explain Why. Share full article Over the summer, some pollsters found declining support for President Trump among young people.
In a Pew survey in August, for instance, 69 percent of Trump voters under 35 said they approved of his performance. That’s a very high number, but it’s a significant dip from the 92 percent who had said the same earlier in the year.
For the latest installment of the America in Focus project, we talked to 11 of these voters — Trump voters in their late 20s and early 30s who told us beforehand that they either somewhat disapproved of his performance or had mixed feelings about it — to understand their specific concerns. Many participants don’t see the economic improvement they hoped for, something that is particularly pertinent to, as one participant mentioned, the working-class Americans who voted for Mr. Trump. Some said changes were needed but the ones being made were too aggressive or focused on the wrong things, like tariffs. A couple were unhappy with the way the United States is handling the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, or the way immigration policy is being carried out.
These voters still don’t think much of Democrats, however — and they had interesting theories about why more voters in their 20s selected Republicans in 2024 than in the last few elections.

Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson What is going well in America these days?
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction I feel like 401(k)s are doing well right now. On the not-so-well side of things, inflation is one thing that really irks me. Where I’m living, what we used to be able to afford in our suburb is unrealistic at this point. And the tariffs are going to raise prices even more.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I tend to be more positive about finances and investments. There’s inflation, but it hasn’t really stopped our economy; from my perspective in the construction industry, we haven’t slowed down.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson What’s going badly in the United States these days?
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager Just what’s going on with current events. It’s like everyone has a side and opinion. People can’t be respectful as far as their viewpoints. It turns very volatile, a lot of times turns racial. I’m tired of seeing it on social media. I’m tired of hearing about it on the news. It’s everywhere. The inflation, too, and I’m tired of renting. I’m trying to purchase a home here in the next — I keep saying, “the next couple of years.” I’ve been saying that for 10 years now. It’s been hard. The job market’s not the best. I’m thankful to still have a job, yes, but a carton of eggs, it’s ridiculous on top of everything else. So I feel like a lot of people, including myself, are in survival mode.
Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny I agree: the inflation and people butting heads with each other about everything right now.
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver Everything just seems mad expensive these days. Prices used to be way lower.

Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Sarah, about your 2. Tell me why, on a scale of 1 to 5, you’re not all the way at complete disaster, you’re at a 2.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer Changes were needed to improve the way the country is running. But maybe some of them are too drastic in my opinion, and maybe not well advised. That ranges from health to tariffs to government arrangement, discrimination. I’m concerned about what else is coming. I understand the need for adjustments, but maybe not to this level.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Cut, why are you at a 3?
Cut, 33, Tenn., Black, Republican, driver Oh, it’s just right in the middle. Things could be better, but you can’t just say it’s all bad. Our military is looking like it’s a little bit better than it used to be. I’d say that.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing I don’t think it’s terrible, but there’s always room for improvement.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Kelsey, I had you down as a 2. Tell me why.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Yeah, at first, I was, like, 1? But no, because it’s not a total disaster, really. Optically, it can feel like a disaster at times, especially with the violence and the blaming. Since 2020, it’s been super volatile.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Across these groups this year, we’ve been asking a bit about different aspects of the economy and technology that have been changing the country and we’d like to do that a bit now. The rise of sports betting: Do you feel like that’s a positive, a negative or a neutral?
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service No, I’m big against it. We’ve seen a rise in incidents with professional players getting cut up with the Jontay Porter situation in Toronto. And then almost like every other week, somebody is getting wrapped up. That’s very troubling, as well as pushing that onto the youth, pushing gambling on the youth. It’s on the T-shirts. It’s on at halftime. It’s in the middle of the game. It’s on the ticket itself. You cannot escape it.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction I enjoy doing it and I do it quite a bit, but it is over the top. During a game, you can’t go three minutes without them mentioning some sort of bet or some advertising from them, I think it can be overwhelming, especially because there’s a large majority of people out there who have a problem. And when they’re pushing it in your face, every other second, it’s just a constant. I would equate it to an alcoholic, and just showing them beers every two seconds.
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver It might be positive for some people, but overall, it’s negative. Now they’re pushing something called “prediction markets,” which are, I guess, supposed to be the crypto version for betting. I just feel like most people are just going to end up losing their money. It’s better that people just invest in traditional stocks, bonds or other forms of investments.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Do people feel like crypto’s positive? Negative? Neutral?
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I invest in crypto. I’ve done well in it. So to me, it’s more positive. But certain politicians or business people get into crypto and I feel like it’s a negative because they’re really exploiting it and pump-and-dumping on the small guy.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager I have a lot of friends who have invested in crypto and they’ve tried to get me to do it. I tried it for a little bit. I don’t like losing money. I didn’t know what the heck I was doing and lost $200. None of my friends who are trying to get me to do it are doing very, very well. I don’t want to just say, well, it’s bad or whatever. But it feels like you’re going to lose a lot of money, more than winning money or earning money.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing I think crypto’s pretty neutral. It’s neither good nor bad, just like any other investment, whether it’s real estate or anything else. It’s an investment, so there is some risk with it. It’s just something that you need to learn, and is a part of my diversified portfolio.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer I like the ability of everyone to be their own investor and have that opportunity to be their own investor and make money. I’m concerned about people in higher positions of power, making comments or dumping when they want to, that can take someone’s entire income overnight, or their savings. But fundamentally, it can be really good.
Moderator, Katherine Miller And of course, A.I.: Is it good for society, bad, neutral, mixed?
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I’m torn on that one. I see a lot of really good and positive things that can come from A.I. My husband is using it to really get into his creative side. He’s used it to write songs and to even write a book and things like that. But on the flip side, people who have that natural talent, it cheapens a little bit when somebody else can just go and do it. For the average user, it probably really is allowing them to do something new that they maybe wouldn’t have been able to do before.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology I love using A.I. I use it almost every day. But I think that the setbacks definitely outweigh the positives. The way that it’s so quickly evolving is risky and dangerous. It’s going to not only have impacts on the youth, but definitely on all brains, and also the environment. There needs to be a balance or some set of restrictions in place.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing A.I. is something that can be really good. Just like anything new that’s introduced, technology-wise, whether it’s the internet or when the industrial boom took place, there were people who had those same types of concerns and there were the same gains in efficiency. We just learned to adapt and set different regulations.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer I’m neutral because I like it and I use it. But I can also see the downsides. You become reliable on a tool, your brain becomes almost use it or lose it. We could cripple ourselves moving forward, I think.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Let’s turn to politics. When you think about Donald Trump, what’s the first word that comes to mind?
Mustafa, 28, Ga., white, Republican, automotive The way that he’s been handling things recently, dictatorship.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager Reckless.
Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny Overpowering.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Aggressive.
Everybody here voted for Trump. When youthink about that decision, were you thinking about it as a vote for Trump or a vote against Harris? Everybody here voted for Trump.When you think about that decision,were you thinking about it as avote for Trump or a vote against Harris? A vote for Trump.

John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I mostly did it because of investment reasons, business reasons. But yeah, I don’t know. I feel like I regretted my vote. I feel like even though my specific investment in cryptocurrency is doing good overall, he has ruined the cryptocurrency market for a lot of cryptocurrencies. A lot of these rich people are just pumping-and-dumping stuff, coming out with tokens. And this is not really what I voted for. I just wanted him to do good with business, the economy. With tariffs, I didn’t know the tariffs were going to be this extreme. That’s not helping anything out at all.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I really liked a lot of what I saw in his first term, especially economy-wise. It made me feel a lot more secure. I felt like I had a lot more buying power, and could really improve my station. During President Biden’s term, I felt like a lot of things went downhill. A lot of Trump’s campaign promises the second time around, I honestly was like, oh, he’s not going to be able to do that. It just seems like he really came out of the gate really aggressively, doing a lot more than I really was anticipating and expecting. The tariffs feel really risky and are giving me a lot of anxiety this time around.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Crypto’s come up. Are there other specific policies or decisions that you’re not totally happy with?
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service We shouldn’t be dumping millions and millions of dollars of resources into helping Ukraine and Israel fight wars that do not affect us directly. I feel like that money could be repurposed into education, homelessness, educating for crypto, colleges, high schools, universities, like that. Those resources can be placed in other ways. We should really stop being the world police. And I feel like with Trump, being the way that he is, stepping out of the Paris Agreement, doing this, doing that, being kind of like, “I’m going to worry about my people and what’s going on in my country,” but now, you’re over here, fighting some wars that have nothing to do with us, but are miles and miles and miles away.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction I believed Trump was focused on lowering drug prices, prescription drug prices. I have a chronic condition. I’m a Type 1 diabetic. And since he has taken office, my medications have tripled in price. Again, I don’t know if that’s a correlation to where I live or my insurance but it’s gotten to a point where, for a disease I did not cause and do not have any control over, seeing a very high increase in the prices that I’m paying.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Immigration. I just think it’s way too aggressive. Even if it’s the worst of the criminals, can they be treated more humanely once they get to the deportation centers?
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer I feel like on Kelsey’s point, I agree. Criminals — drug dealers, violent people — don’t belong here. The thing I’m worried about is this administration’s use of executive power. I have a hard time trusting in my current democracy and my Constitution when I’m not really sure I’m seeing those honored even in these processes of deportation. Sometimes I don’t know if I’m getting the real truth, and if somebody was documented and causing certain issues, or were they not? Is it just anything goes?
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson You all told us that you voted for Donald Trump. But you have some level of either regret or misgivings.
Do you think Donald Trump’s second term is going how you’d expected, or is it going better or worse? Do you think Donald Trump’s secondterm is going how you’d expected, or isit going better or worse? It’s going how I’d expected.

It’s going better than I expected. No one raised a hand.
Mustafa, 28, Ga., white, Republican, automotive It’s not what I expected. We’re focused on Ukraine and Israel more than I feel like the United States. The military, I like it, has gotten much better than it used to. But I thought he was going to come in and end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.
Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny He said he was trying to come to St. Louis with the National Guard to help with crime. I think he needs to focus on other things, and not bring the National Guard into other cities.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager For me, it comes down to taxes and jobs. The job market is just not good at all. I have a lot of friends and family members who are struggling to find work. He made it seem like he was going to look out for the working-class people and it’s the exact opposite.
Cut, 33, Tenn., Black, Republican, driver This is about what I was expecting, especially when it comes to immigration.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing He’s a businessman at his core. So I knew he was going to bring those aggressive negotiation skills and those power plays into the presidential thing. So I’m not surprised.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Is Donald Trump focused on the right topics? Is Donald Trump focused on the right topics? OK, only one of you is saying yes. Jody, why?
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction He’s focusing on our trade agreements, immigration, and I don’t think we should get superinvolved in the world but, for better or for worse, America has been. I think he’s focusing on the right areas. How he goes about it, we can discuss more about that.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction There are a couple of silly things that I’m just like, why is this a thing? Examples are the Gulf of America. Why are we doing that? Renaming the Department of War, I don’t know why that’s even an effort that we’re making. It’s good that he’s focusing on trade, for example, but he’s not handling it the right way.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology He is focused on immigration and trying to make America safer. But he’s also focused on himself. It’s silly. And for me, it was a hard election. Which one, hopefully, will be better overall? I wish that he could deflate inflation, for sure. I don’t know, personally, how to do that.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager I want him to focus more on gun violence. We keep hearing about these shootings. These current events just happened and also these school shootings. I have a lot of nieces and nephews. And we have to pray to make sure that our kids are going to school safe and having a safe school year. It’s crazy to me.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson What are things you wish Donald Trump were doing but that he’s not doing now?
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I feel everything is connected to the economy. I feel like the main focus should just be the economy. If you can fix the economy, it really reduces crime. I feel like he and other politicians should be way more aggressive against the mass shooters. We don’t talk enough about how we can stop these people before they go do these mass shootings.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction Trump’s a businessman. And I knew that. And I thought that was a positive. But with that being said, he’s a businessman, and is he making decisions now that’s going to benefit him after this presidency? What’s truly in it for us, compared to himself, after this presidency is over?
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson A few issues have come up. Tariffs: Raise your hand if you think he’s doing a good job with tariffs. OK, I’m not seeing any hands go up.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I’m in the construction industry. I can see that our prices, our shipping, has gone up, which definitely means that as a company, we have to increase our prices in order to get certain jobs.
And I’ve heard stories of people who have ordered something online, but it costs four times as much just because of the import.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Another issue that hasn’t come up as much, but is something that Donald Trump made a big piece of his campaign message, was his promise to make America healthy again. How do you feel about what Donald Trump is doing when it comes to making America healthy again?
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing I like the idea of getting rid of some of the dyes and all this other stuff. A lot of the things that I have been working on with my own family were things that he talked about doing during his campaign, especially bringing Kennedy in.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology I don’t know if it’s really Trump’s or R.F.K.’s work, but I love it. I think that our F.D.A., there’s just so many things that are approved that shouldn’t be approved, and so many things that need to be approved that aren’t. Lines get blurred because it’s health care, F.D.A., whatever. But oh my God, if we could reduce obesity and just create a healthier country, it would be wonderful.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer I have some reservations about immunizations or vaccinations. I think to an extent, there should be some more research on certain things. But measles, mumps and rubella is pretty well identified and researched. And kids can die from that, and have. I’m concerned there could be a mass pandemic. Can you imagine how parents would feel when their kid dies from a preventable disease or gets paralyzed?
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson I want to ask about one more issue that a few people have mentioned, which is the situation in Israel and Gaza. How do you feel about the way Donald Trump is handling that really difficult issue?
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver In my opinion, when it comes to America — and I guess Israel is one of the big partners in the Middle East and considered one of the few democracies over there — I feel like they give them a lot of leeway, but at the same time, I understand their situation. It would be good if that conflict can resolve.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology It's one of the longest-going conflicts. I wish there was an easy fix. Honestly, it would be wonderful if the president could, but I just have no expectations with that.
Moderator, Katherine Miller We’ll switch gears a little bit. What’s the first word that comes to mind when you hear “the Democratic Party?”
Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny Against.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager Unorganized or unprepared.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction Angry.
Cut, 33, Tenn., Black, Republican, driver Lack of leadership.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction Irresponsible.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Jody, when you say “angry,” they’re angry? You’re angry?
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I feel like my interactions with people who are Democrat or would think that same way, they seem much more on the defensive about a lot of these issues.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction They make a lot of strong statements, but don’t necessarily back up what they’re saying. I’m thinking more fiscally. Give all this money, forgive all the student loan debt, do all these things. That obviously has a big impact on the economy, and an impact they seem to ignore.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Abbie, you said “against.”
Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny I just feel like they don’t agree with things on the Republican side.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Ten, 20 years ago, in general, younger voters leaned heavily Democratic. In the last couple of years, there’s been some shifting. What do you think might be driving that shift?
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver Before, being on the left was more edgy. Being on the right now, it’s more edgy. Most people grew up with Obama. Maybe they feel like he just didn’t live up to his promise. And people want to try something on the other side.
Cut, 33, Tenn., Black, Republican, driver I know when I was younger, it was just Fox News that was conservative. But now with social media and YouTube just being out there, it’s so much easier to access and just see everything, see different points of view.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing With the rise in social media for us, in this age group now, we have access to more information. So we’re able to make more informed decisions. It also really highlighted how weak the Democratic leadership was for us.
Moderator, Katherine Miller If the Democratic Party were to start over and take your advice about what to focus on, what would you tell them?
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Gun violence. I’m huge on that, and then the economy. One thing that drives me crazy about them is they say they’re the middle-class party. Can’t we just be for everybody? They’re the party for everybody. Do they need to be for the middle class? I’m middle class, but I also want to support every class, from poor people to the rich — I just want equality.
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service I feel like they have a lack of identity and a lack of leadership. I feel like the Republican Party does have a better icon, in Donald Trump, with the ideology and the idealism behind him. You know what he stands for. With the Democratic Party’s, they don’t have that leader. I feel like the last person to really have that role was like Obama. Currently, right now, aside from A.O.C. and Bernie, I really don’t see anybody even who has a major exposure or brand behind the Democratic Party. Their vision of the future seems very negative to a lot of people. And I like them, I personally like them. I’m independent. I actually think they have a lot of great points. But they’re negatively viewed. The party has a lack of leadership.
Mustafa, 28, Ga., white, Republican, automotive I agree with Juan pretty much. It’s just the lack of leadership, the lack of identity. I feel like they were supposed to be focused on the people and like they were mentioning, the middle class or the lower class. I feel like, especially the last two years before the term went up and Trump came in, it was just the focus on what was going on in Ukraine. It’s not for the people.
Moderator, Katherine Miller Are there any Democrats that people like?
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service Cory Booker’s OK.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I actually think that that’s part of the problem, is that any of them who are more moderately minded and would appeal to more people are not broadcast enough because they’re not out there so much. Their ideas are quieter, I guess, so they’re overshadowed by the ones that are just really far out there. So that’s part of the issue, too.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Let’s talk a bit about Republicans.

John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I’m a Republican. But at this point, I think I’m tired of both parties. I think I’m about to become an independent.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson For those of you who think you are likely to vote for Republican candidates in the future, tell me a little bit about why.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer So I’m a conservative Republican, a constitutionalist. Republicans tend to focus a little bit more on things that matter to me, like the economy. That impacts me. Inflation is really high right now, but hopefully they can adjust that. To an extent, immigration, though maybe not the way I’m seeing it right now. This term is not showing a focus on education, but I’ve seen it in the past.
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service I do think they need to be focused more on this: Who’s going to be the next face of the Republican Party? Who’s going to be the possessor of this whole MAGA movement that he has created, for better or worse, the past decade or so, or even going on to 20 years, almost. So is it going to be JD Vance? Two years come quickly. He’s not going to be around much longer. So who’s going to be the new face? Who’s going to be the guy who brings the new ideas, who brings the people together?
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Besides Donald Trump, are there any Republican leaders or figures that you like?
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Nikki Haley.
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service I’m personally a big fan of Marco Rubio and, mostly, Ron DeSantis.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing I was just going to say DeSantis.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer I really like Nikki Haley. I wish she hadn’t given in.
Jody, 32, Mo., white, Republican, construction I would say Vance. Vance is probably an obvious one, but also Josh Hawley. He backed Missouri’s issues and he wouldn’t back down from things.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Briana, tell me a little bit about why you like Ron DeSantis.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing He has that bold personality where he has potential to step in and make those changes that a lot of people are afraid to make. It doesn’t seem like he cares so much about people liking him. I’m all about that.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Juan, you mentioned Rubio. Tell me what you like about Marco Rubio.
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service Little by little, he’s been building an experience in politics. He ran for president. He stepped up to Trump. He said a lot of things to him that were true. But he’s also grown enough to put their differences aside and work with the new administration. He’s been one of the more prominent figures in the new administration.
Do you think JD Vance would be a goodnext leader of the party? Do you think JD Vance would bea good next leader of the party? 1 person raised a hand.

Abbie, 29, Mo., white, Republican, nanny I think they need somebody else in there. I don’t know. I just think he’s so attached to Trump that he doesn’t speak his mind sometimes.
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing Same. I don’t feel like he has his own persona. He’s just riding Trump’s coattails right now and taking on his energy and his persona. I don’t know what that will look like without Trump standing behind him, what type of leader he would be, personally, because he hasn’t shown us that.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager Yeah, I think he’s just a mini clone of Trump. I don’t really think he has any original ideas or ideologies that he stands for on his own.
Moderator, Katherine Miller A few people have alluded to Charlie Kirk’s assassination in the conversation, mentioning current events. How did you experience the news of his death?
Briana, 33, Mich., Black, independent, marketing Actually, my teenage daughter came home talking about it. And then I saw it on my Apple News after she mentioned it, because Apple News stalks our conversations, clearly.
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I first saw about it on YouTube, maybe MSNBC. They have posts about it. After that, I started seeing it on social media.
Moderator, Katherine Miller A couple of people have mentioned gun control. Are there things that people are worried about after this happened, or think will happen?
John, 28, Fla., Black, Republican, delivery driver I think it’s going to encourage more crazy people, more yahoos, to go and do crazy stuff like that.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology I would love to see change to stop shootings, whether that’s with A.I. or gun control.
Juan, 32, N.J., Latino, independent, customer service I was not the biggest fan; I didn’t necessarily agree with him. We shared conservative views and agreed on certain topics while disagreeing on other things — but that was the beauty of it. Even though you may not agree with someone 100 percent or share the same views, they were open to dialogue for conversation. They opened that door. They left that door open for someone with opposite views. What happened to him shouldn’t happen. Nobody should have to die like that. It was terrible.
Quinton, 33, Ga., Black, Republican, account manager Yeah, and for me, you go on social media. That’s where I was going. Just the comment section, you have people that are happy and rooting for his demise and all of that. And now the conversation is being geared towards celebrating someone no longer being here, as opposed to the real issue at hand.
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer What happened to him is very sad, especially for how old he was. His loss should be definitely mourned in a very respectful manner. I also don’t completely understand about flying him on Air Force Two — that seems like something usually done for military or presidents only.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction I did follow a lot of what he did, not necessarily agree with all of it. But I like that he had a platform, and he was open and honest in speaking with the people that he did. You and I could have completely different thoughts, and he would have a conversation with you. It would not get heated. He wouldn’t yell. It was just a conversation. And I like the way that he presented himself. One thing that troubles me is there’s a deeper layer to what’s happening with shootings like this. I don’t know how you address it.
Moderator, Kristen Soltis Anderson Are there things that you think politicians, the media, other big institutions don’t get about what it’s like to be a young adult in America today?
Sarah, 32, Mont., white, Republican, engineer So I don’t think they understand that I may never be able to get my own house. I make good money, but we’re talking about finances here that are through the roof. And then we’re stacking on debt right now. I really don’t even know what financial stability looks like in five to 10 years from now. I feel like the American dream is being redeveloped. I’m not really sure what that looks like.
Kelsey, 32, Ill., white, independent, technology Completely second that. I just think that they have no idea what it’s actually like. They were in their late 20s and 30s at some point. They were maybe always in Washington, and with all of this power and privilege. But even if they were, I’ll say — I hate to use the word “normal,” but you know what I mean, everyday people — it’s a vastly different world than it was 20 years ago, even 10 years ago. I just have no idea what the future holds.
Cory, 31, Tenn., white, Republican, construction You can’t afford to do anything. I’ve got a small family myself. There’s four of us living on one income. And we are very fortunate in our situation. But I don’t know how many people are making it between costs, housing and then the health care costs. I’ve mentioned that a couple of times here, but that is a big pain point.
Mustafa, 28, Ga., white, Republican, automotive The struggle is real now in general, with the groceries, cost of living, just how crazy health care expenses are. It’s way too much.
America in Focus seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism.This discussion was moderated by a focus group veteran, Kristen Soltis Anderson, and Katherine Miller, a staff editor in Opinion. Ms. Anderson has done similar work over the years for Republican candidates and partisan groups. She chose the participants. (Times Opinion paid her for the work.) This transcript has been edited for length and clarity; an audio recording of the session is also included. Participants provided their biographical details. As is customary in focus groups, our role as moderators was not to argue with or fact-check the speakers, and some participants expressed opinions not rooted in facts.Illustrations by Lucinda Rogers.Share full articleRelated ContentAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2025 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences
