Share full articleSince returning to office, President Trump has waged a global trade war without parallel in modern history. Nearly every country has seen duties on its exports to the United States rise since his inauguration, with some rates set at punishing levels, reaching as high as 50 percent.Mr. Trump implemented the bulk of his new duties starting Aug. 7, capping off months of haggling, tinkering and delay that began after the president’s proclamation of “Liberation Day” in the spring. Mr. Trump enacted the new rates through a series of executive orders, some of which reflect preliminary trade deals struck recently with countries that offered favorable concessions to the United States.The actions amount to an audacious gamble by the White House, which believes its policies can reset the world trading order, raise new federal revenue and pressure private businesses to make more of their products domestically. Mr. Trump unveiled his latest round of duties in late September, targeting heavy-duty trucks, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, upholstered furniture and pharmaceuticals, in a bid to force companies to manufacture those goods in the United States.Whether Mr. Trump can succeed remains an open question with great consequence for the U.S. economy. The president’s trade brinkmanship has rattled financial markets around the world, and his tariffs threaten to raise prices on American consumers and businesses, who often ultimately foot the bill for those duties on imported goods. His tariffs are also the subject of an ongoing legal dispute that the Supreme Court has recently agreed to hear.Here’s where things stand for the world.

Notes: The “fentanyl” tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada only apply to goods not covered under the U.S.M.C.A. Brazil has an additional “free speech” tariff, China has an additional “fentanyl” tariff. The president said that imports from India would face an additional penalty for the country’s imports of Russian oil, in addition to the 25 percent Aug. 1 tariff. Some goods from the European Union may be subject to different tariff rates. New rates for E.U. countries are dependent on existing tariff rates on individual goods, and designed to be a minimum of 15 percent.

At the end of July, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on dozens of countries that he accused of treating the United States unfairly on trade. Those duties became official on Aug. 7, just after the stroke of midnight.Bolivia, Ecuador, Iceland, Nigeria and many other nations have tariff rates of 15 percent, while others, including Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Vietnam, face duties of 20 percent.The tariffs do not apply to goods that were loaded onto ships just before the president signed his executive order, so long as those goods enter the United States by early October. The president also put in place new penalties for countries that engage in transshipment, a tactic where goods from highly tariffed countries are routed through nations with lower duties. If the administration finds evidence of this, Mr. Trump has established a steep additional tariff of 40 percent.Some of the highest new rates apply to imports from Brazil, which are subject to a tariff of 50 percent.Mr. Trump first targeted Brazil in a searing letter in July that attacked that country’s leaders for their treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump’s who is facing charges for inciting a coup.For India, meanwhile, the new tariffs were initially set at 25 percent. But those duties doubled on Aug. 27, after Mr. Trump announced another slate of duties on India stemming from the country’s purchase of Russian oil.Some of these countries had faced the prospect of even steeper duties when the president began his trade war earlier this year. At the time, Mr. Trump sought to impose “reciprocal tariffs,” which he calibrated using a widely questioned methodology based on the size of the U.S. trade deficit with each country. In the end, Mr. Trump settled on a different approach.
Countries facing a standard 10% tariff Even the smallest nations are already subject to a baseline tax on their imports.

Some countries have not been targeted with specific new tariff threats. Instead, they are subject to a flat, 10 percent tariff on all imports into the United States, under an order Mr. Trump signed earlier this year.
A set of new deals The White House has struck agreements with major trading partners, including the European Union.

Mr. Trump initially sought to broker 90 deals in 90 days, as one of his advisers described it. While the White House would ultimately fall far short of that goal, the president did manage to strike a series of preliminary trade agreements with a handful of nations, including those in the European Union, before his self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline.Each of the deals set those countries’ tariffs at 15 percent or higher, lowering what would have been steeper duties in exchange for favorable trade concessions and new promises to invest in the United States. But details of many of those agreements remain scant, and in some cases, they still need to be negotiated.In late July, Mr. Trump said he brokered a deal with South Korea, setting tariffs on its exports at 15 percent. South Korea pledged to open its markets to American goods, invest in the United States and purchase more of its energy.The president has also inked a preliminary agreement with the European Union that set a 15 percent tariff on most of the bloc’s goods, including cars and pharmaceuticals. While E.U. officials similarly pledged to purchase U.S. energy and make new investments, the bloc’s leaders later suggested that the financial commitments were less rigid than they appeared.White House officials previously announced similar framework agreements with Britain, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Japan. The deal with Indonesia, for example, set its tariff rate at 19 percent. For several countries, the deals impose higher duties on goods that use a significant portion of parts or raw materials from countries including China and Russia.
China Some of the highest tariffs have been reserved for the world’s second-largest economy.

The United States has set a 30 percent baseline tariff on imports from China under an agreement unveiled in May that walked back, at least for now, a highly damaging tit-for-tat escalation of duties between the two superpowers. (Other tariffs may also apply to Chinese goods.)The deadline for the current rate to expire is Nov. 10, after Mr. Trump signed an executive order this month granting a new 90-day extension.Mr. Trump has said that tariffs could rise again without a new deal. But he signaled that it would be less than the 145 percent rate the U.S. government had imposed at one point in April, as the two sides escalated trade penalties on each other. China has long been a target for Mr. Trump, dating back to his first term. Upon returning to office, he initially sought to penalize Beijing for failing to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States.
De minimis rule The loophole had allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods without paying tariffs.
Even as Mr. Trump imposed his most unforgiving tariffs, his administration largely left in place a policy that allowed Americans to import goods up to $800 without facing duties. The policy, known as the de minimis exemption, officially ended in late August, meaning that these goods will face tariffs based on their country of origin.The president previously eliminated this exemption on goods arriving from China, in a move that threatened to deliver a blow to e-commerce, since 60 percent of de minimis shipments to the United States came from that country and Hong Kong.
Canada and Mexico Two of America’s closest trading partners face steep tariffs, though many goods may be exempted.
Canada now faces a tariff of 35 percent, up from 25 percent, under an order that Mr. Trump signed. Mexico, meanwhile, will not see an increase to its 25 percent tariff for the next 90 days, as the two sides continue negotiating. In both cases, White House officials signaled they would exempt some goods that were already covered by a trade deal brokered by the three countries during the president’s first term: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A.Mr. Trump first took aim at Canada and Mexico in February, announcing a 25 percent import tax on all arriving goods, which the president justified by saying the two nations had not sufficiently helped to combat the flow of fentanyl. Facing blowback domestically and abroad, he later paused and modified that arrangement to reflect the U.S.M.C.A. while talks continued. Share of imports entering under U.S.M.C.A. trade deal

Several of Mr. Trump’s tariffs target specific products or industries globally, using a provision of federal law — Section 232 — meant to help the president address trade issues that present national security threats.Since the start of his second term, Mr. Trump has announced these duties on imports of aluminum, foreign cars, car parts and steel. In September, he also targeted heavy-duty trucks; bathroom and kitchen cabinets; upholstered furniture; and pharmaceuticals, with a carve out for companies working to manufacture drugs in the United States. The tariffs take effect Oct. 1.In some cases, the tariffs do not pile on top of duties targeted at specific countries. For others, like the European Union, agreements brokered with the United States would override the sector-specific duties.The president has signaled on numerous occasions that he is pursuing additional sector-specific tariffs, including on semiconductors, which he said at one point could be set at 100 percent.Mr. Trump has also announced new investigations expected to lead to tariffs on wind turbines.
