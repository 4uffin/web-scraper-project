Nate CohnChief political analyst With all the current candidates in the running, Zohran Mamdani holds nearly a two-to-one lead, 46 percent to 24 percent, over Andrew Cuomo, according to the New York Times/Siena University poll of the race. But if Cuomo got a one-on-one race against Mamdani, he might have a real shot at winning, the poll found. Of course, Mamdani’s upset win in the primary is a helpful reminder that low-turnout elections can have unpredictable electorates. This mayoral general election is no exception.

About this data *The pollster’s simulation of ranked choice results are shown when available.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling Polls largely underestimated Zohran Mamdani’s support in the Democratic primary for the New York City mayor, illustrating once again just how difficult it can be to accurately poll primary elections. While most polls did not show Mamdani leading in the first round of balloting, they did appear to show him gaining support in the final weeks of the campaign. He ultimately won with more than 56 percent of the vote after ranked-choice tabulation.
