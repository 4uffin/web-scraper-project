Carlos Lozada - The New York Times
Skip to contentSkip to site index Today’s PaperCarlos LozadaI am an Opinion columnist based in Washington, D.C.AboutContactFeaturedLatestWhat I Focus OnI write about politics, culture, history and policy, mainly through the prism of nonfiction books and other texts, like Supreme Court opinions and congressional investigation or commission reports. I’m especially intrigued by how public figures reveal themselves, intentionally or unwittingly, through their writings. When I write about campaign books, political biographies or Washington memoirs, people often say to me, “You read those books so we don’t have to!” True, you don’t have to — but trust me that there is much to learn in them. This work has led to two books of my own: “What Were We Thinking: A Brief Intellectual History of the Trump Era” (2020) and “The Washington Book: How to Read Politics and Politicians” (2024). I try to avoid armchair opinionmongering. Instead, I seek to give a fair hearing to a variety of ideas and arguments and then help readers draw their own conclusions, as I draw mine.My BackgroundBefore joining The Times in 2022, I spent 17 years at The Washington Post, where I was the nonfiction book critic, Outlook editor, national security editor and economics editor. Previously, I was the managing editor of Foreign Policy magazine. Early in my career, I was a consultant at the Inter American Development Bank and an analyst in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. I studied economics and political science at the University of Notre Dame and did graduate studies in public policy at Princeton University and in journalism at Columbia University. I was born in Lima, Peru, and became a U.S. citizen in 2014. I received the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 2019 and currently serve on the Pulitzer Board.Journalistic EthicsI strive for fairness, honesty and depth. I believe that there is something called truth, and I do my best to approximate it. My overriding value is skepticism. Along with all Times journalists, I am committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.Contact MeEmail: carlos.lozada@nytimes.comX: @CarlosNYTFeaturedCreditAnthony EslickThe Inside Joke That Became Trump’s Big Lie CreditDamon Winter/The New York TimesMike Pence Is Having a Moment He Doesn’t Deserve CreditIgor BastidasI Looked Behind the Curtain of American History, and This Is What I Found CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesA Look Back at Our Future War With China CreditAkshita Chandra/The New York TimesIn One Word, Biden and Trump Tell Us Exactly Who They Are Latest Carlos LozadaKamala Harris Is Out of Time“107 days” is not merely the duration of Harris’s campaign; it is also her excuse for losing the election.By Carlos Lozada Carlos LozadaWhat MAGA Lost When It Lost Charlie KirkHis death makes it harder to look ahead and glimpse what MAGA will stand for.By Carlos Lozada Carlos LozadaEnough With the Trump Era CompulsionThe compulsion to zero in on the president keeps us from understanding the era fully, and from glimpsing what it might become.By Carlos Lozada Carlos LozadaHow I Built My Ruthless Summer Reading ListWhichever books you choose, and however you choose them, may your summer reading be satisfying, and your curating ruthless.By Carlos Lozada Carlos LozadaWhat Reading 5,000 Pages About a Single Family Taught Me About AmericaWhen I was a teenager, a mostly forgotten series of novels taught me U.S. history.
