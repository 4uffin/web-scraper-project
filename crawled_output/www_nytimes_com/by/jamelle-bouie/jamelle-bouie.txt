Jamelle Bouie - The New York Times
Skip to contentSkip to site index Today’s PaperJamelle BouieI am an Opinion columnist based in Charlottesville, Va.AboutLatestWhat I CoverI write about politics and the law through the lens of American political history. I believe that history can help us ask good questions about our present circumstances, and I am deeply interested in our nation’s moments of structural political reform, from its founding to Reconstruction and into the New Deal. I am also a close reader of American political theory and bring to my writing the influence of a broad range of thinkers, observers and practitioners. More than anything, I hope readers come away from my work having learned something new and useful about the nation’s history.My BackgroundMy first job in journalism was at The American Prospect magazine, which I joined in 2010, not long after graduating from the University of Virginia. I covered politics at The Prospect for several years before joining The Daily Beast and then moving on to Slate magazine, where I spent five years as a politics writer and, later, chief political correspondent. I joined The Times in 2019. I live in Charlottesville, Va., with my wife, kids and a dog.Journalistic EthicsI come from a left-leaning, social democratic perspective, but I strive for honesty, fairness and good faith in my writing. I am scrupulous about the facts and try as much as I can to avoid idle speculation. I believe in both personal and professional transparency and do as much as I can to show my sources so that readers can decide if I have it right.As a columnist, I abide by the same rigorous ethical standards as all Times journalists to ensure our independence and credibility.
