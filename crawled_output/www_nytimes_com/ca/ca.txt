This week, the Trump administration chose to make a move that could come with political and economic peril: bailing out Argentina.Alan RappeportArgentina has lurched from economic crisis to economic crisis in recent decades. The country’s latest reform efforts are faltering and its president, Javier Milei, has seen his political fortunes fade.Alan RappeportTrump has a personal fondness for Milei and wants to prop him up. The Treasury Department is planning to give Argentina a $20 billion loan in hopes that it will help Milei’s party in legislative elections next month.Alan RappeportBut bailouts are not popular in the U.S., and some critics argue that Trump is flouting his own “America First” agenda in favor of “Making Argentina Great Again.” Alan RappeportTrump and his Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, insist that Argentina is a crucial ally that gives the U.S. a foothold in Latin America, where it is competing with China for influence.Doug Mills/The New York Times
