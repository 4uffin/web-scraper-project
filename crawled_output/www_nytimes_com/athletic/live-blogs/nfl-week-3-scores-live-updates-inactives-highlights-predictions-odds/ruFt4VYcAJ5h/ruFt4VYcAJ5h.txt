Adam Coleman·Staff Editor, NFLWhat to know about Week 3 in the NFLFor once, it's the backup QB's time to shine. Carson Wentz led the Minnesota Vikings to a 48-10 thrashing of the Cincinnati Bengals. All eyes were on an NFC Divisional round rematch today, where the Eagles earned the 33-26 comeback win over Los Angeles Rams.In the afternoon window, the Bears handled the Cowboys in a much-needed 31-14 win. Stay tuned here for the latest.What you should read nextRussini: What I'm hearing Week 3 power rankingsWeek 3 takeawaysSeptember 21, 2025 at 8:15 PM EDTMike DeFabo·Staff Writer, SteelersSteelers steal a win thanks to ‘turnover culture’ and Cam Heyward’s two hands FOXBORO, Mass. — Inside the visitor’s locker room, defenders who produced game-changing splash plays were everywhere.
There in the corner with a huge crowd around him was safety Jabrill Peppers, grinning from ear to ear, as he explained how he “envisioned” celebrating his fumble recovery against the team that cut him just weeks ago. There in the middle of the room was outside linebacker Nick Herbig, giving credit to T.J. Watt for the strip-sack that helped set the stage for the go-ahead touchdown. There beside Peppers was backup cornerback Brandin Echols, talking about his game-sealing tackle on fourth down, and trying to remember the details of a red-zone interception he called a “blur.”
And then there was Cole Holcomb, the man who started the turnover party on the third play from scrimmage, trying to explain Cameron Heyward’s performance.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 9:19 PM EDTZack Rosenblatt·Senior Writer, JetsFor Jets, Will McDonald’s miracle TD wasted — but Aaron Glenn still insists the tide is turning TAMPA, Fla. — One moment, Tyrod Taylor was sitting on the bench talking to himself — repeating the words Aaron Glenn had spoken at halftime, about confidence, about belief. The next moment, he was standing up, pointing to the sky.
Glenn sashayed down the sideline, gesticulating as if the demons that had haunted the New York Jets for 3.5 quarters were being exorcised from his body. He stepped and threw his right arm up, then threw his left arm up and swung them behind his back. He hugged a coach. He hugged a player.
It felt like a special moment. And it was, but it lasted only for a moment. Defensive end Will McDonald hurdled the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ field-goal blocking crew, then leapt, arms reaching high, before kicker Chase McLaughlin’s foot had even struck the football. The kick ricocheted off his arms, the ball flying backward for 15 yards and bouncing just high enough for McDonald to grab it out of the air. He ran straight ahead, never turning his head, as he crossed the goal line for a touchdown while his teammates celebrated on the sideline.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 9:14 PM EDTColton Pouncy·Staff Writer, LionsRaiders struggle in every phase of lopsided loss: ‘We were no good today’ LANDOVER, Md. — In the lower tunnels of Northwest Stadium, answering for his team’s 41-24 drubbing at the hands of the Washington Commanders, Las Vegas Raiders coach Pete Caroll was asked if he saw this coming.
“No,” Carroll said, matter-of-factly, already waiting for the next question. “If I had known that, I would’ve done something (differently).”
Truthfully, there’s only so much Carroll can do when his team plays like this. Offense, defense, special teams — it was a group effort in a losing endeavor. It all got away from the team before Carroll knew it.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 9:12 PM EDTNate Atkins·Senior Writer, RamsRams looked like a team that had grown. Then the Eagles broke their hearts again PHILADELPHIA — Even after everything that spiraled, the Los Angeles Rams had their chance in the final minutes — to right the wrongs in this game, on a field where last season’s title hopes ended.
But when the ball snapped and was placed on the ground, everything went wrong. Jordan Davis burst through the field goal unit and swatted Joshua Karty’s kick. Then Davis scooped the ball and returned it for a touchdown as Philadelphia Eagles fans turned Lincoln Financial Field into a frenzy.
The Rams lost 33-26 in what felt like two games in one. This was a day of swirling momentum, with stars on both teams trading splash plays until someone had to lose. The Rams were again in a battle with the defending champions, but suffered their third loss to Philadelphia in the past year.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 8:47 PM EDTBrooks Kubena·Staff Writer, NFLJordan Davis punctuates Eagles’ defensive dominance with game-winning FG block PHILADELPHIA — Protocol said for Jordan Davis to go down. For once, the defensive tackle didn’t listen. Not after batting a last-second field goal from the sky. Not after finding the football still rolling on the turf. Not after scooping it with a grace he didn’t have a year ago and seeing nothing but 61 yards of green grass ahead.
A hysteric home crowd urged him on. They’d hurtled boos and Bronx cheers by the tens of thousands. Disgusted by an abysmal start, they’d prepared for the heartbreak of a failed comeback. They’d watched Los Angeles Rams kicker Joshua Karty line up for a 44-yard field goal that would’ve offset the one-point deficit. But Davis knew what teammate Jalen Carter learned when blocking Karty’s 36-yard attempt the drive before, enabling Philadelphia’s go-ahead drive: Karty’s trajectory was low. And it was low again.
And Davis ran. He ran until the scoreboard winked Eagles 33, Rams 26. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni smiled, mouth agape. Go down, his logic screamed. His detail-obsessed brain would later recall a 2021 preseason game in which former Eagles defensive back Michael Jacquet stripped the football loose for a scoop-and-score that sealed the game. For Davis, logic be damned. Sirianni tore his headset loose and chased after Davis himself.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 8:44 PM EDTJayna Bardahl·Staff Writer, NFLBaker Mayfield says Buccaneers’ win over Jets was ‘personal’ Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield said “a lot of stuff was personal” in the Bucs’ 29-27 win against the New York Jets.
Speaking to reporters postgame, Mayfield singled out Jets defensive coordinator Steve Wilks, who was the interim head coach of the Carolina Panthers after they fired Matt Rhule in 2022. Mayfield began that year as the Panthers’ starter, but was later released in Week 12 as Wilks turned to PJ Walker instead.
“Their D-coordinator (Steve Wilks) was the one that cut me in Carolina, so a lot of stuff was personal today,” Mayfield said. “Haason Reddick, former Jet, a lot of people.”Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 8:33 PM EDTAlec Lewis·Staff Writer, VikingsIsaiah Rodgers produces all-time defensive performance as Vikings maul Bengals MINNEAPOLIS — At one point, all of the Minnesota Vikings’ defenders surrounded Isaiah Rodgers on the sideline. He was leaning over on the metal bench, gassed after another game-breaking play. They’d already patted him on the helmet. High fives were no longer going to do this performance justice. So, they circled around him and showered him with bows as if to say: All hail Isaiah.
This is what happens when you play one of the best defensive games in NFL history. And Rodgers unequivocally did.
Minnesota’s 48-10 mauling of the Cincinnati Bengals occurred largely because the unsuspecting cornerback scored two defensive touchdowns and forced two fumbles. That had never been done before in a game. Rodgers accomplished the feat in a half.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 8:12 PM EDTMike Jones·Staff Writer, NFLJaguars rising, Texans stumbling as AFC South rivals are headed in opposite directions JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — For a split second, it appeared as if the Jacksonville Jaguars would let yet another opportunity against their AFC South rival Houston Texans slip through their fingers.
Both teams had slogged through a largely unsightly, penalty-plagued, punt-heavy affair Sunday afternoon at EverBank Stadium and the hosting Jaguars clung to a one-score lead five minutes and change into the fourth quarter when the slippage occurred.
Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw one of the most mind-bending interceptions, and on the very next play his Texans counterpart C.J. Stroud connected on a 50-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Nico Collins (taking advantage of a blown coverage) to tie the game at 10-10. Suddenly, the Texans — back-to-back AFC South champs, winners in their last seven trips to Jacksonville and 13 of the last 15 games in the series — appeared to have dramatically swung the momentum in their direction and pulled within striking distance of their first victory of the season.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 8:08 PM EDTPaul Dehner Jr.·Senior Writer, BengalsBengals’ historical loss to Vikings concerning — but not because of the final score MINNEAPOLIS — At the two-minute warning of the first half, the Bengals appeared poised to weather the Minnesota storm on Sunday. Jake Browning threw a pick-6 in the first quarter and they were fighting an early deficit, but they hit a field goal and were in Vikings territory. They were getting the ball first in the second half.
By the time they reached the locker room at halftime, they trailed 34-3.
They fumbled on three of the next four snaps, one returned for a touchdown and another when they were merely trying to run out the clock.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 8:03 PM EDTJon Machota·Staff Writer, CowboysJerry Jones said he still fully believes the Cowboys are a playoff team.September 21, 2025 at 5:21 PM EDTThe Athletic NFL StaffHow good was Caleb Williams? How did the Packers lose? Our NFL experts’ Week 3 takeaways By Tim Graham, Ted Nguyen and Dan Pompei
Each Sunday, three of The Athletic’s NFL writers react to the biggest news, plays and performances from the day’s games.
If you like blocked field goals, you loved Week 3, when game after game was decided by special teams mayhem. The Green Bay Packers were set to go ahead of the Cleveland Browns, until their short field goal try late in the fourth quarter was blocked. Cleveland won. The Los Angeles Rams were set to go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles, until their field goal attempt on the game’s final play was blocked. Philly won. The New York Jets blocked a fourth-quarter Tampa Bay Buccaneers kick and returned it for a go-ahead touchdown — but lost anyway.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 7:34 PM EDTChad Graff·Senior Writer, PatriotsHow the rebuilding Patriots fumbled away a game they could’ve won against the Steelers FOXBORO, Mass. — Drake Maye stood behind a lectern, his leg pads still on, and kicked himself for the myriad of things that cost the New England Patriots in their latest loss at Gillette Stadium, this one a 21-14 setback to the Pittsburgh Steelers that dropped them to a league-worst 3-16 at home since the start of 2023.
If any of about a dozen things had gone differently Sunday, the Patriots would have walked out with a win, a record above .500 for the first time in over a year and more encouraging signs from Maye.
Instead, Maye stood thinking back to the Patriots’ final play. It was fourth-and-1, back inside the Steelers’ 35 for the sixth time, driving down the field with ease once again. It was a quick pass on the outside to DeMario Douglas, the promising slot receiver who has struggled through the first several weeks this season. The diminutive Douglas caught it at the 28-yard line. Fall forward three feet and he would move the chains as the Pats aimed to tie the game. But Douglas tried to make a defender miss. He ran backward and was tackled. Ballgame.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 7:28 PM EDTJoseph Person·Senior Writer, PanthersShutting out the Falcons, avoiding 0-3 start a ‘big deal’ for Panthers and their defense CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The end was near.
Kirk Cousins, the Atlanta Falcons’ $180 million backup quarterback, was mopping up a blowout loss while the sound guy at Bank of America Stadium was cueing up “Sweet Caroline,” the Carolina Panthers’ victory anthem that’s gotten a little dusty the past few years.
The Panthers had mostly their second-team defense in to close out the stunning 30-0 victory, with the exception of linebackers Trevin Wallace and Christian Rozeboom, the former L.A. Ram who admitted he was keeping an eye on the scoreboard as the Falcons drove into Panthers’ territory in the final minute.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 7:29 PM EDTMatt Schneidman·Staff Writer, PackersDissecting Packers’ late collapse in a stunning 13-10 loss against the Browns CLEVELAND — Packers left tackle Rasheed Walker said on Wednesday that he thought Green Bay could go undefeated.
Defensive end Micah Parsons, Walker’s teammate at Penn State, supported Walker puffing his chest out but offered caution.
“They always say you should share your dreams in private because people won’t understand ’em,” Parsons said Friday.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 7:21 PM EDTDan Wiederer·Senior Writer, Chicago BearsChicago needed this. The Bears needed this. Yes, Sunday’s 31-14 defeat of the Dallas Cowboys must be put inside its proper frame, a home win over a beatable and vulnerable opponent with a shaky and depleted defense. But for a Bears team 350 days removed from its last victory at Soldier Field, Sunday’s performance was a welcome treat to a fan base that has had its patience tested for far too long. It was also sweet relief to a team needing some positive reinforcement for its efforts. Now, everyone can exhale and regroup for Week 4 with a little less tension and a little more enthusiasm.Quarterback Caleb Williams was the Bears’ engine Sunday, connecting on two stadium-shaking touchdown passes in the first quarter to get the Bears off to a strong start. Williams took advantage of strong protection and man-to-man coverage on his favorite receiver to hit his first touchdown, a 35-yard bomb down the left sideline to Rome Odunze. On the first play of the next possession, a flea-flicker set Williams up for a 65-yard scoring strike to Luther Burden III. By day’s end, Williams had completed passes to eight different players. He had a career-high four TD passes, each to a different target, to go along with 298 passing yards. If anyone needed this kind of day, Williams needed this.September 21, 2025 at 7:19 PM EDTDaniel Popper·Staff Writer, ChargersFINAL: Chargers 23, Broncos 20 Justin Herbert completed his final eight passes, including a tying TD to Keenan Allen. Cameron Dicker hit the winner from 43 yards. Chargers stay undefeated and in first place in the AFC West.AdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 6:45 PM EDTJosh Kendall·Senior Writer, FalconsFalcons embarrassed by Panthers and their own offensive performance: ‘An all-time low’ CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Optimism and the Atlanta Falcons have always had a problem sharing the same space.
Seven days after an encouraging prime-time effort as underdogs in Minnesota, the Falcons were the seemingly disinterested favorites in Carolina. On Sunday, they were handed a 30-0 loss by the previously winless Panthers.

Panthers vs. Falcons takeaways: Carolina nabs first win with blowout
Carolina broke the game open in the third quarter when cornerback Chau Smith-Wade returned a Michael Penix Jr. interception for a touchdown.
Second-year quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played his worst game as a pro and was replaced by Kirk Cousins in the fourth quarter, raising the question of how secure Penix’s starting job is heading into next week’s game against the Washington Commanders (2-1). Coach Raheem Morris tried to close that door quickly postgame, saying Cousins will not be competing for the starting job this week.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 6:10 PM EDTSaad Yousuf·Staff Writer, NFLField goal blocks steal spotlight at end of Sunday’s early NFL games It was a field goal block party across the NFL’s early slate of games Sunday. Three kicks were blocked in the final two minutes of three separate games, with two of those blocks swaying the final result.
The Cleveland Browns trailed the Green Bay Packers 10-0 when they got the ball with nine minutes left in the fourth quarter. After the Browns scored a field goal on that drive, followed by a touchdown after intercepting Jordan Love, the Packers appeared to wake up just in time to rectify their late-game misgivings.
With 27 seconds left, Brandon McManus lined up for a 43-yard field goal that would’ve given Green Bay a 13-10 lead. The Browns did not have any timeouts remaining. Instead, Denzel Ward came around the left edge and blocked the field goal. Greg Newsome recovered the ball on the Cleveland 47-yard line. After a Micah Parsons neutral zone infraction put the Browns in Green Bay territory, Joe Flacco completed a couple of passes and set up Andre Szmyt for a walk-off win.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 6:16 PM EDTDoug Haller·Senior Writer, Arizona Cardinals’ James Conner ruled out Cardinals have ruled out Conner with an ankle injury.Load more updatesNationalBoxingBundesligaChampions LeagueChampionshipCollege FootballCollege SportsCopa AmericaCopa del ReyCricketCultureCyclingEuropa LeagueEuropean ChampionshipFA CupFantasy BaseballFantasy BasketballFantasy FootballFantasy HockeyFantasy Premier LeagueFIFA Club World CupFormula 1GamingGlobal SportsGolfInternational FootballLa LigaLeague CupLeague OneLeague TwoMemorabilia & CollectiblesMen's College BasketballMen's World CupMixed Martial ArtsMLBMLSMotorsportsNASCARNBANFLNHLNWSLOlympicsOpinionPeakPremier LeagueSailingScottish PremiershipSerie ASoccerSports BettingSports BusinessTennisTop Sports NewsWNBAWomen's College BasketballWomen's EurosWomen's HockeyWomen's SoccerWomen's World CupThe Athletic InkPodcastsHeadlinesUSArizonaAtlantaBaltimoreBay AreaBostonBuffaloCarolinaChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianaJacksonvilleKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesMemphisMiamiMinnesotaNashvilleNew OrleansNew YorkOklahomaOregonOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghSacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSeattleSt. LouisTampa BayUtahWashington DCWisconsinCanadaCalgaryEdmontonMontrealOttawaTorontoVancouverWinnipegPartnersCollectibles by eBayOdds by BetMGMStreaming by FuboTickets by StubHubSubscribeStart SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionsHQAbout UsCareersCode of ConductEditorial GuidelinesBusiness InquiriesPress InquiriesSupportFAQForgot Password?Contact UsTerms of ServiceNewslettersThe PulseThe BounceThe WindupPrime TireFull TimeUntil SaturdayScoop CityThe Athletic FCMoneyCallRed Light©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times CompanyPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicySupportSitemap
