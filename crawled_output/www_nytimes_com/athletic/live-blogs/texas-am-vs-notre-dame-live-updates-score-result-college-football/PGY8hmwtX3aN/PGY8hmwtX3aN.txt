Later, they‚Äôll have tough road matchups at LSU and Texas, both of whom are ranked in the top 10 and will likely still be when they host Texas A&M.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 12:54 AM EDTAustin Green¬∑Live ReporterNext up for Notre Dame¬†Getty ImagesNext week, Notre Dame hosts Purdue, which just lost to Fighting Irish rival USC today. Then Notre Dame goes on the road to play Arkansas in Fayetteville before returning home to host Boise State, which was a College Football Playoff team last year.The road gets easier for the Fighting Irish coming up, but not by much.September 14, 2025 at 12:47 AM EDTRalph D. Russo¬∑Senior Writer, CollegeIrish Playoff hopes aren‚Äôt done yetNotre Dame probably needs to win out to get into the playoff. 10-2 with losses by a combined 4 points to two teams that I suspect are also going to be waist deep in the CFP race makes a pretty good case.Wouldn't hurt if USC, Arkansas and Boise State were all pretty good.September 14, 2025 at 12:42 AM EDTPete Sampson¬∑Staff Writer, Notre DameND cornerback diagnoses defenseLeonard Moore asked about what was wrong with the defense against Texas A&M: üí¨ ‚ÄúLeverage, eyes, knowing your assignment in certain formations.‚ÄùSeptember 14, 2025 at 12:37 AM EDTMichael Charles¬∑Live ReporterPrice impresses in lossWhat a running back duo Notre Dame has at its disposal.In the first half, Jadarian Price looked like better of the Irish‚Äôs two backs, displaying an impressive combination of vision, burst and power. He finished the night with 12 carries for 68 yards and two touchdowns.On his second score, he wisely bounced a run to the perimeter, saw daylight and turned on the jets for an 18-yard dash into the end zone, even throwing a nice stiff arm to buy him some space.September 14, 2025 at 12:32 AM EDTMichael Charles¬∑Live ReporterLeaning on Love¬†Getty ImagesEven with Jadarian Price having a stellar game, Notre Dame still leaned heavily on Jeremiyah Love, especially in the fourth quarter. The junior running back finished the night with 27 total touches, rushing for 94 yards and a touchdown on the ground while adding four catches for 50 yards and a score as a pass catcher.Down the stretch, he was featured often, including a bunch of wildcat formations and direct snaps. In fact, Love gave Notre Dame the lead in the final minutes with a powerful, 12-yard touchdown run.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 12:27 AM EDTDavid Ubben¬∑Staff Writer, College FootballMarcel Reed‚Äôs flourishment¬†Getty ImagesTexas A&M didn‚Äôt just win a game, it learned a lot about its offense and quarterback.Last season, first-year starter Marcel Reed‚Äôs production spiked late in the season after a slow start. He looks like a much more developed passer in his second season as a starter.Reed racked up a career-high 360 yards on 17-of-37 passing for his first career 300-yard game in the win against the nation‚Äôs runner-up a season ago, boasting two of the nation‚Äôs top corners in Leonard Moore and Christian Gray. No completion was bigger than Reed's scrambling touchdown pass ‚Äî his second of the night ‚Äî to tight end Nate Boerkircher that gave the Aggies the win.Reed was showing anticipation, throwing with accuracy and hitting throws he rarely hit consistently last year. And it helps that he‚Äôs got an upgraded group of speedy receivers in KC Concepcion from NC State, Mario Craver from Mississippi State and Terry Bussey. Craver hauled in an 86-yard catch and run in the first half from Reed, who completed the pass rolling left. Craver‚Äôs seven-catch, 207-yard night made him the Aggies' first 200-yard receiver since Mike Evans in 2013. That can‚Äôt happen with an improved passer like Reed.Moore and Gray were battling injuries, but Reed is showing the kind of growth that gives A&M an offense balanced enough to contend for the SEC. September 14, 2025 at 12:22 AM EDTPete Sampson¬∑Staff Writer, Notre DameNotre Dame‚Äôs defensive decline¬†Getty ImagesNotre Dame built last year‚Äôs run to the national championship game around its defense under coordinator Al Golden and a veteran spine that included two sixth-year seniors and a two-time All-American. It‚Äôs proving much harder to replace all that than Marcus Freeman would have expected.The Irish were picked apart by Marcel Reed, who put Notre Dame in unfamiliar and uncomfortable territory. By halftime, the Irish defense allowed the same number of touchdowns through six quarters (seven) than it did in the first six games of last season. Apparent injuries to cornerbacks Leonard Moore and Christian Gray didn‚Äôt help. Neither did the Aggies‚Äô speed at wide receiver, which got behind the Irish secondary all game.The shock of Notre Dame‚Äôs defense taking this big of a step back this quickly should send up alarm bells as first-year coordinator Chris Ash has yet to find the right formula for a defense expected to pick up where last year‚Äôs left off. The Irish didn‚Äôt sack Reed after taking down Carson Beck just once in the loss at Miami. Notre Dame forced its first turnover of the season but finished with just the Moore interception. And the Irish posted just one tackle for loss all night.Notre Dame‚Äôs defense won‚Äôt be tested by speed like Texas A&M for the next month, perhaps not until USC visits on Oct. 18. But with a defense that‚Äôs putting some vexing material on tape, it‚Äôs not clear how much Notre Dame can rely on it‚Äôs defense moving forward.Once a known quantity, the Irish defense is now a riddle that Ash needs to solve as soon as possible. Notre Dame won't make the College Football Playoff unless he does. September 14, 2025 at 12:18 AM EDTPete Sampson¬∑Staff Writer, Notre DameFreeman backs DC Chris Ash¬†Getty ImagesMarcus Freeman, who is one of the highest-profile defensive-mined head coaches in college football, says there is no consideration to changing play callers on defense away from defensive coordinator Chris Ash.September 14, 2025 at 12:15 AM EDTAustin Green¬∑Live ReporterYour views on that instant classic of a game¬†Getty ImagesLet‚Äôs hear from Notre Dame fans after that absolute heartbreaker in South Bend:Matt B: Great game. Texas A&M was better and they really won the game twice, given the kickoff return. They had better protection up front and that was the difference in this one, I think. ND made a lot of good plays, but in key moments, A&M blocked better and their dynamic receivers made some key plays that led them to victory. The Irish have a lot to play for -- Arkansas in Fayetteville, USC at home in October, etc. -- but they do not belong anywhere near the playoffs with two losses and no conference championship to play for.Zach Y: So disappointing to lose back to back games like this. Surprised by the defensive play this far this season. 1 sack only. None tonight. Reed was slinging.Milan P: We can still make the playoffs if we win out. Early losses are waaayyy better than late season losses.September 14, 2025 at 12:11 AM EDTAustin Green¬∑Live ReporterCarr continues to impress¬†Getty ImagesSure, CJ Carr could have played better tonight, but it‚Äôs hard to place the blame completely on him in either of Notre Dame‚Äôs two season-opening losses against ranked opponents. Carr had some mistakes, including a bad interception late in the first half and a botched snap on fourth down when he clapped out of frustration and sent the wrong signal to his center.But he also engineered five Notre Dame touchdown drives and seven scoring drives altogether. If not for a botched hold on Notre Dame‚Äôs final extra point and defensive miscues all night long from the Fighting Irish, Notre Dame would have won.Carr finished 20-of-34 passing for 293 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. That should be good enough to defeat most opponents with a team like the one Carr has around him. It just barely fell short tonight.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 12:08 AM EDTRalph D. Russo¬∑Senior Writer, CollegeBig time BoerkircherNate Boerkircher, a fifth-year senior who transferred from Nebraska in the offseason, had just 21 catches and one touchdown in his career before scoring the game-winner for A&M.It was his third catch this season and first touchdown since 2022.September 14, 2025 at 12:05 AM EDTMichael Charles¬∑Live ReporterCraver shines¬†Imagn ImagesAt one point tonight, Mario Craver was on pace for over 300 yards of receiving.While that did not come to fruition, his statline in Texas A&M's win was still absurd. Craver caught seven of his 12 targets for 207 yards, including an 86-yard touchdown.On that long score, he made a leaping grab before accelerating down the sideline. He was met by a cloud of Notre Dame defenders but somehow absorbed the contact, spun to stay on his feet and sprinted the rest of the way untouched for the touchdown.September 14, 2025 at 12:02 AM EDTMichael Charles¬∑Live ReporterMoss made an impact¬†Getty ImagesTexas A&M would not have won this game without Le‚ÄôVeon Moss‚Äô production in the first two quarters. The running back rushed for three touchdowns in the first half, finishing the game with 73 yards rushing on 18 carries.None of his touchdowns were long runs, but they were physical, earning his way into the end zone with force.September 13, 2025 at 11:59 PM EDTStewart Mandel¬∑Senior Columnist & EIC, College FootballWhat a night ...¬†Getty ImagesGeorgia 44, Tennessee 41 (OT) and Texas A&M 41, Notre Dame 40 on the same day was an absolute treat.September 13, 2025 at 11:56 PM EDTPete Sampson¬∑Staff Writer, Notre DameNotre Dame's pass defense fails¬†Getty ImagesTexas A&M finished with 360 yards passing and two touchdowns against a defense that finished No. 1 nationally in pass efficiency last season. Just hard to get your head around what's happened to this defense. Just two TFLs tonight and one sack.AdvertisementSeptember 13, 2025 at 11:53 PM EDTAustin Green¬∑Live ReporterLet‚Äôs hear from Mike Elko¬†Getty ImagesLess than two years ago, Mike Elko returned to College Station as head coach of a talented but perennially underachieving program.Underachievers no more. Here‚Äôs Elko to NBC on the field at Notre Dame Stadium:üí¨ ‚ÄúUnbelievable. Marcel Reed, our two wide receivers Mario (Craver) and KC (Concepcion) kept making plays. Nate Boerkircher makes an unbelievable play. We didn‚Äôt play great, but we made all the plays we needed to make to win the game.‚ÄúThis is the next step. We‚Äôre a 3-0 football team, we got a lot of big games left, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like playing in this league, but we had to go on the road at night and beat a ranked team, and we did that tonight.‚ÄùSeptember 13, 2025 at 11:50 PM EDTMichael Charles¬∑Live ReporterAll you need is ReedMarcel Reed just led the Aggies to a road win over Notre Dame with a last-second touchdown pass that could have stymied the Irish's playoff hopes already.The sophomore out of Nashville finished the night with 360 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception, adding another 37 yards on the ground. On the game-winning touchdown, he rolled out to his left as he was pressured before lofting a 50/50 ball to Nate Boerkircher, who high-pointed the football beautifully. His quarterback gave him a chance and the tight end made a play.September 13, 2025 at 11:48 PM EDTAustin Green¬∑Live ReporterIrish on thin iceNotre Dame‚Äôs hopes of returning to the College Football Playoff are now on life support ‚Äî thanks to two games they lost against ranked opponents by a total of four points.Load more updatesNationalBoxingBundesligaChampions LeagueChampionshipCollege FootballCollege SportsCopa AmericaCopa del ReyCricketCultureCyclingEuropa LeagueEuropean ChampionshipFA CupFantasy BaseballFantasy BasketballFantasy FootballFantasy HockeyFantasy Premier LeagueFIFA Club World CupFormula 1GamingGlobal SportsGolfInternational FootballLa LigaLeague CupLeague OneLeague TwoMemorabilia & CollectiblesMen's College BasketballMen's World CupMixed Martial ArtsMLBMLSMotorsportsNASCARNBANFLNHLNWSLOlympicsOpinionPeakPremier LeagueSailingScottish PremiershipSerie ASoccerSports BettingSports BusinessTennisTop Sports NewsWNBAWomen's College BasketballWomen's EurosWomen's HockeyWomen's SoccerWomen's World CupThe Athletic InkPodcastsHeadlinesUSArizonaAtlantaBaltimoreBay AreaBostonBuffaloCarolinaChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianaJacksonvilleKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesMemphisMiamiMinnesotaNashvilleNew OrleansNew YorkOklahomaOregonOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghSacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSeattleSt. LouisTampa BayUtahWashington DCWisconsinCanadaCalgaryEdmontonMontrealOttawaTorontoVancouverWinnipegPartnersCollectibles by eBayOdds by BetMGMStreaming by FuboTickets by StubHubSubscribeStart SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionsHQAbout UsCareersCode of ConductEditorial GuidelinesBusiness InquiriesPress InquiriesSupportFAQForgot Password?Contact UsTerms of ServiceNewslettersThe PulseThe BounceThe WindupPrime TireFull TimeUntil SaturdayScoop CityThe Athletic FCMoneyCallRed Light¬©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times CompanyPrivacy PolicyYour Ad ChoicesSupportSitemap
