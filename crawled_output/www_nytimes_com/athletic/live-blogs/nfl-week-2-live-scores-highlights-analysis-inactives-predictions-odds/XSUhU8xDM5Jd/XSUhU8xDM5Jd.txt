By then, he had already watched tape from the Baltimore Ravens’ season-opening 41-40 loss to the Buffalo Bills three times.
He had already attended a players-only dinner where some grievances were aired. He had already sat through multiple meetings and listened to the defense he leads get called “immature” by teammates and coaches. He had already heard the warning from defensive coordinator Zach Orr, who cautioned that repeated mistakes would not be tolerated.
By Tuesday night, two full and painful days after the Ravens blew a late 15-point lead in Buffalo and just under five days before Baltimore was set to host to a division rival, Smith and the defense were finally able to move on. They had no other choice.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 8:40 PM EDTIan O'Connor·Senior WriterJosh Allen is too good and too tough not to win a Super Bowl The Athletic has live coverage of Dolphins vs Bills in ‘Thursday Night Football’.
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Steam was rising out of the hissing showers nearby, and there was Josh Allen slumped on a stool in front of his locker, looking like a club fighter from Jersey who had picked the wrong opponent for a payday.
Though the Bayonne Bleeder had actually won this bout by technical knockout, it sure didn’t seem that way. Dion Dawkins was standing across the room when he nodded toward the quarterback whose nose was starting to resemble a zombie film.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 8:41 PM EDTDan Wiederer·Senior Writer, Chicago BearsBen Johnson’s homecoming spoiled by Bears’ ugly loss to Lions: ‘It’s a kick in the teeth’ DETROIT — By the time coach Ben Johnson arrived at his postgame news conference late Sunday afternoon, he already had time to process the stunning beatdown his Chicago Bears took Sunday at Ford Field, a 52-21 loss to the Detroit Lions that somehow didn’t even feel that close.
The Bears trailed by at least two scores the entire second half. Their deficit ballooned past 20 points midway through the third quarter. And by the time the Lions faced fourth-and-goal from the 4-yard line with eight minutes remaining, Johnson knew exactly what was coming.
A Detroit field goal attempt? No chance in hell.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 8:14 PM EDTZack Rosenblatt·Senior Writer, JetsAaron Glenn’s honeymoon phase with the Jets is officially over EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Aaron Glenn stood on the sideline late in Sunday’s game, pant legs rolled up to his ankles, arms crossed, sweat dripping down his forehead. There are times when Glenn’s temper flares. It happens in practice, on the sideline, and especially while fielding questions at press conferences. There is not much that gnaws at him like wasted time.
During the first quarter, he screamed at Micheal Clemons as the veteran defensive end walked off the field after a ruinous penalty. He stomped and waved his arms, keeping at it even as the conversation ended and Clemons walked away. During the second quarter — when the game was already out of hand — he walked up to Garrett Wilson and spun his right arm in a circle, a message to his offensive captain to get things moving. His frustration would boil over in low moments, when tackles were missed, flags were thrown, footballs were fumbled and the Jets, as they do, couldn’t get out of their own way. After the 30-10 drubbing at the hands of the Buffalo Bills was complete, he bristled during his post-game press conference, staring daggers into the soul of a reporter who asked a question he didn’t like.
What was your view of the passing game?Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 8:06 PM EDTZac Jackson·Staff Writer, BrownsBrowns’ embarrassing offensive performance vs. Ravens is nothing new BALTIMORE — In the winding and exhaustive journey that is an NFL season, mid-September should really be no time to panic.
If you believe what you’ve seen from an anemic Cleveland Browns offense over the first two games and specifically in Sunday’s ugly 41-17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, a full-on panic would be understandable.
The Browns don’t have the players to intimidate opponents or score against good teams. Unless the defense can deliver a series of superhuman efforts, it’s hard to see this group keeping up.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 8:03 PM EDTJon Greenberg·Senior Columnist &amp; EIC, ChicagoThe Bears’ season just began and already it feels like the bad old days DETROIT — With about 7 minutes left and the Detroit Lions nursing a 31-point lead, the hometown fans started a “F— Ben Johnson” chant in the north end zone.
Don’t worry, Lions fans, I think Johnson is aware that now that he’s the head coach of the Bears, he’s completely and utterly … you know what, let’s move on. It’s only the second game of a long, fruitful coaching career in Chicago, right?
Then again, all we can focus on is the present. Isn’t that what athletes and coaches always tell us? Be where your feet are and all that.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:55 PM EDTJoe Buscaglia·Staff Writer, BillsJosh Allen battles through nose injury as Bills defense dominates Jets The Athletic has live coverage of Dolphins vs Bills in ‘Thursday Night Football’.
Bills quarterback Josh Allen stepped up to the lectern in the visitor’s news conference room at MetLife Stadium after the team’s 30-10 thumping of the Jets, sporting a nose that looked nearly doubled in size from what it had been before the game. The postgame interview cut right to the chase.
“How’s the face?” Allen was immediately asked.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 7:42 PM EDTVic Tafur·Staff Writer, 49ersBattered 49ers limp home with plenty of swagger at 2-0 after gutty win in New Orleans NEW ORLEANS — Fred Warner had to wipe away tears as he walked off the field at the Superdome, he was so overcome with emotion.
The walking-wounded San Francisco 49ers are 2-0 — with both wins on the road — after hanging on to beat the New Orleans Saints 26-21 in front of a lot of Niners fans on Sunday.
Ricky Pearsall, meanwhile, was taking it all in, smiling ear to ear.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 7:22 PM EDTKevin Fishbain·Senior Writer, BearsIsaac TeSlaa’s catch explained: What officials said about confusing Bears-Lions call DETROIT — The Chicago Bears seemed a couple of seconds away — or an officiating consensus away — from entering the locker room trailing only by a touchdown at halftime of Sunday’s 52-21 loss to the Lions.
Confusion reigned at Ford Field after Lions quarterback Jared Goff’s deep ball to receiver Isaac TeSlaa, whose one-handed catch put Detroit at the Bears’ 4-yard line. Even though the official closest to TeSlaa signaled he was out of bounds after the catch, another official said he was in bounds, and the clock continued to run. Goff sprinted to the ball and spiked it as the clock hit zero. One official spoke with Bears coach Ben Johnson and let him know time had run out.
The Bears ran to the locker room. They had stopped the juggernaut from scoring and would be getting the ball to start the second half with a chance to tie the game with a touchdown.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 7:27 PM EDTJoseph Person·Senior Writer, PanthersPanthers' comeback attempt falls shortThe Panthers looked dead in the water, trailing 27-3 with a little more than two minutes left in the third quarter. But with Bryce Young finding a lot of underneath passes against the Cardinals’ soft zone, the Panthers started moving down the field. They ended up scoring 19 unanswered points and had a chance at the end after recovering an onsides kick. But Calais Campbell sacked Young on fourth down with 26 seconds left to seal it. Still, Young showed some moxie while finishing with career highs in completions (35), attempts (55) and passing yards (325), and tying his high with three TD passes.September 14, 2025 at 7:11 PM EDTMichael-Shawn Dugar·Staff Writer, SeahawksSeahawks hijack ‘Renegade’ to put Steelers away in Pittsburgh: ‘That’s our song’ PITTSBURGH — The Seattle Seahawks had a plan for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ finishing move.
Midway through the fourth quarter, with the Steelers trailing by seven points, Pittsburgh began to blast “Renegade” by Styx. It’s a cue for the fans at Acrisure Stadium to wave their Terrible Towels while the defense gets hyped up to the tune of their song.
Or at least what used to be their song.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:16 PM EDTAdam Coleman·Staff Editor, NFLColts move to 2-0The Colts win on a 45-yard field goal by Spencer Shrader after a very costly Broncos penalty. Denver's Dondrea Tillman was called for a leverage penalty after Shrader missed the original 60-yard field goal, which would've given the Broncos the win as time expired. Instead, Shrader got a retry at 45 yards and didn't waste his second chance.September 14, 2025 at 7:07 PM EDTJoseph Person·Senior Writer, Panthers Getty Images

When Maye completed the 33-27 win over the Miami Dolphins, he kept the game ball in his left hand, even as others approached him for a postgame bro hug or asked for it. But Maye wanted to ensure the football found its way back to head coach Mike Vrabel, a significant piece of memorabilia to mark the first win of the Vrabel era.
Still, this Patriots victory was about more than that.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 7:05 PM EDTJoseph Person·Senior Writer, PanthersPanthers trying to make it interesting in Arizona. Panthers have scored 18 unanswered points, trail 27-21 with 1:58 left (pending the PAT).September 14, 2025 at 6:38 PM EDTJayna Bardahl·Staff Writer, NFLTrevor Lawrence and Liam Coen moment of frustration ‘not personal,’ says Jags coach Tensions were high as the Jacksonville Jaguars entered the final minutes of Sunday’s road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, leading by just a field goal.
On second-and-14 from the Cincinnati 16-yard line, Jags quarterback Trevor Lawrence targeted receiver Dyami Brown on a throw that would have put Jacksonville in a good position to extend its lead. Instead, the pass went over Brown’s head, prompting frustration from head coach Liam Coen on the sideline, who yelled toward Lawrence and patted his chest. Lawrence glanced at his coach before turning around and waving him off.
“That was just one throw, I was pissed. You know, it is what it is,” Coen told reporters after the game. “That’s emotion, it’s not personal ever. That’s just me getting worked up.Full StoryAdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 6:44 PM EDTJames Boyd·Staff Writer, ColtsThe Colts' four-year, $60 million investment in free safety Cam Bynum continues to pay off.

Fox instead showed bonus coverage of the Dallas Cowboys-New York Giants game in overtime while the Chiefs-Eagles matchup kicked off. Even some subscribers of YouTube’s NFL Sunday Ticket experienced the delay until the Cowboys’ Brandon Aubrey won the game on a 46-yard field goal as the overtime period expired.
In a statement to The Athletic, YouTube said there were “no issues” with the broadcast. The Chiefs-Eagles game, as a national broadcast, would not typically be available on Sunday Ticket, though YouTube said it did make the game available until the Cowboys-Giants game ended.Full StorySeptember 14, 2025 at 6:29 PM EDTNate Atkins·Senior Writer, RamsRams CB Ahkello Witherspoon suffer broken clavicle vs. Titans Getty Images
