Staley saw the most targets on the team, reeling in nine of his 12 targets for 97 yards. He also added a touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter to give the Vols the lead, finding a hole in Georgia's secondary and waltzing in for a 32-yard score.
September 13, 2025 at 8:30 PM EDTJoe Rexrode·Senior Writer, TennesseeAguilar is a revelation — and a ceiling changer Getty ImagesHe was on his way to the best quarterback game … ever? Then he and the Tennessee offense disappeared for a long stretch Saturday, bringing recent Vols failures against Georgia to mind. But Aguilar — the former zero-star recruit and community college quarterback, the seventh-year senior, the last-second replacement for departed starter Nico Iamaleava — resumed a magical day with one perfect 53-yard bomb for a touchdown to Chris Brazzell.Aguilar started 14 for 14 with three touchdowns and looked unstoppable. Then stops came in droves. But in the end, Aguilar got it rolling again and was every bit as clutch as Hendon Hooker was three years earlier in a familiar-feeling win over Alabama. The only problem: His kicker didn’t make the field goal to beat Georgia, as Chase McGrath did three years ago to beat Alabama. Still, the Vols have a veteran with the experience and skill set to run this offense as Heupel wants it run. Oh, and he has some weapons — starting with Brazzell (six catches, 177 yards, three touchdowns).September 13, 2025 at 8:25 PM EDTSeth Emerson·Senior Writer, CollegeGeorgia changed the game in the trenches Imagn ImagesWhere Georgia improved in the second quarter was by getting a better pass rush, and the linebackers playing the passes to the middle more effectively. Tennessee also couldn’t run the ball consistently, which was a problem in previous matchups. So ultimately it came down to passing, and when Aguilar could hit on those deep balls, Tennessee finally had the Georgia defense figured out. When he didn’t have time to pass, Tennessee didn’t.AdvertisementSeptember 13, 2025 at 8:20 PM EDTSeth Emerson·Senior Writer, CollegeHow did the Heupel-Smart matchup play out? Imagn ImagesIt was by far the best performance for Heupel’s Tennessee offense against Smart’s Georgia defense.Fast starts were one thing: Tennessee had scored on its first possession each of the previous four matchups, including three touchdowns. Keeping it up was the difference this time, hitting on touchdowns the first three possessions and racing out to a 21-7 lead. And even after the Vols were shut down in the middle of the game, with three punts and two interceptions on five consecutive drives, the Vols recovered late, scoring on three consecutive drives late in the third and in the fourth quarter.Tennessee had 356 yards through three quarters and 496 for the game. The most Heupel’s Vols had in the previous four meetings against Smart was 387, and that was in the first matchup (2021), when a lot of the yardage was playing catch-up in a 41-17 Georgia win. This time, Tennessee kept pace the whole game.The deep balls were game-changers, admittedly helped by poor play by Georgia’s cornerbacks. Daniel Harris and Ellis Robinson lost one-on-one matchups, and there was a defensive breakdown that led to the 32-yard touchdown to Braylon Staley that put Tennessee up 35-30 in the fourth quarter. Joey Aguilar was also pinpoint accurate to start the game, hitting passes to the middle, something previous Tennessee quarterbacks had not done well against Georgia.September 13, 2025 at 8:15 PM EDTSeth Emerson·Senior Writer, CollegeGeorgia has plenty to address Imagn ImagesThe game revealed more paramount issues for Georgia, though, despite the win.The offensive line broke down as the second half went along, reigniting concerns about that unit. The pass blocking was a problem almost the entire game, while the run blocking didn’t get a consistent push.And of course, there was the defense, starting badly and giving up the lead twice in the fourth quarter.The main takeaway: Georgia has a lot of work to do, but if Stockton keeps playing the way he did Saturday, quarterback won’t be a concern.September 13, 2025 at 8:11 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterBrazzell shines in loss Getty ImagesWin or lose, Chris Brazzell deserves praise for the game he put together this afternoon.The wideout caught six passes for 177 yards and three touchdowns, including two explosive plays. In fact, one of his touchdown catches was a 56-yarder and the other, which came in the first quarter, spanned 72 yards. On both occasions, Joey Aguilar launched a jump ball to him and both times, he used his physicality to completely displace his defender before highpointing the football and dashing into the end zone. September 13, 2025 at 8:08 PM EDTSeth Emerson·Senior Writer, CollegeStockton proves his mettle Getty ImagesGunner Stockton came into his first road game as a primary storyline: Could Georgia win with him at quarterback?Stockton did enough for the Bulldogs to win a shootout.He was effective both throwing and running, passing for 304 and rushing for 38. He even showed the downfield throwing ability that was the question coming in, hitting on a 45-yarder to Colbie Young on Georgia’s first play, and putting a perfect ball into Humphreys’ hands for the late, game-tying touchdown.He wasn’t perfect: In the fourth quarter, he made a similar mistake to last season’s College Football Playoff game against Notre Dame, holding onto the ball too long and fumbling on a blind-side sack. But he and Georgia’s skill-position players all played pretty well. Ten different players caught passes.September 13, 2025 at 8:05 PM EDTAustin Green·Live Reporter Getty ImagesGunner Stockton after winning his first start in SEC play:💬 “These are moments we practice for and dream of.”AdvertisementSeptember 13, 2025 at 8:03 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterBranch's big play Getty ImagesWith Georgia trailing 21-7, Zachariah Branch made one of the biggest plays of the game, taking a screen 37 yards to the house to get the Bulldogs back into the game. His speed and big-play ability adds a much-needed element to Georgia's attack, showing the propensity to make any touch a touchdown.He finished the afternoon with five catches for 69 yards and the score.September 13, 2025 at 7:59 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterFrazier shines against Tennessee Getty ImagesWhile Josh McCray found the end zone twice, Nate Frazier was Georgia's most effective and efficient runner tonight.He rushed for 73 yards on 14 carries, averaging 5.2 yards per attempt against a Tennessee defense that played the run well today, even breaking off a 21-yarder.September 13, 2025 at 7:57 PM EDTAustin Green·Live ReporterAguilar belongs on this stageTennessee spent years (and millions of dollars) grooming Nico Iamaleava for games like these, only for the former five-star recruit to acrimoniously transfer from the Volunteers in the spring over a reported compensation dispute. Iamaleava left for UCLA — where he’s now 0-3 against non-Power 5 competition.With limited options, the Volunteers brought in Joey Aguilar — who was only in the transfer portal because Iamaleava took his job at UCLA.And Aguilar, whose winding collegiate journey started at City College of San Francisco and included two years at Appalacian State, showed he can handle the SEC stage.Aguilar showed more in one game than Iamaleava did in any SEC game last year. The 24-year-old went 24-for-36 for 371 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions. He did everything he could to set the Volunteers up for a game-winning field goal in the final minutes of the fourth quarter. He plays like that going forward, and Tennessee should find itself right back in the College Football Playoff.GO FURTHEREarly returns have Tennessee winning, Nico Iamaleava losing the QB ‘trade’ of the offseasonSeptember 13, 2025 at 7:56 PM EDTDavid Ubben·Staff Writer, College Football Getty ImagesGeorgia and Tennessee just reset the bar for the best game of the season.September 13, 2025 at 7:53 PM EDTStewart Mandel·Senior Columnist & EIC, College FootballMissed opportunity for Vols Imagn ImagesThat's gonna hurt for a long time for Tennessee. Missed opportunity.Credit to Gunner Stockton for that tying TD drive. He finished 23-of-31 for 304 and 2 TDs.AdvertisementSeptember 13, 2025 at 7:50 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterMcCray made it happen Imagn ImagesGeorgia's running game was contained for most of the afternoon but when the Bulldogs got near the goalline, Josh McCray was the guy and he was able to execute, finding the end zone twice. He only averaged 2.4 yards per attempt this afternoon but he fought for tough yards in the trenches, including on the game-winning touchdown in overtime.September 13, 2025 at 7:47 PM EDTAustin Green·Live ReporterGeorgia extends win streak over Tennessee to nineThat’s now nine games in a row Georgia has won over its rivals to the north.

He’s been here before...💬 “I’m really proud of this team. Tennessee deserved to win this game, we didn’t play our best game. I got a lot of respect for the way they played. But these kids, man, they never quit. A lot of naysayers out there about Gunner, I thought he played really well today. Didn’t play real well offensively, give Tennessee a lot of credit.”Load more updatesNationalBoxingBundesligaChampions LeagueChampionshipCollege FootballCollege SportsCopa AmericaCopa del ReyCricketCultureCyclingEuropa LeagueEuropean ChampionshipFA CupFantasy BaseballFantasy BasketballFantasy FootballFantasy HockeyFantasy Premier LeagueFIFA Club World CupFormula 1GamingGlobal SportsGolfInternational FootballLa LigaLeague CupLeague OneLeague TwoMemorabilia & CollectiblesMen's College BasketballMen's World CupMixed Martial ArtsMLBMLSMotorsportsNASCARNBANFLNHLNWSLOlympicsOpinionPeakPremier LeagueSailingScottish PremiershipSerie ASoccerSports BettingSports BusinessTennisTop Sports NewsWNBAWomen's College BasketballWomen's EurosWomen's HockeyWomen's SoccerWomen's World CupThe Athletic InkPodcastsHeadlinesUSArizonaAtlantaBaltimoreBay AreaBostonBuffaloCarolinaChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianaJacksonvilleKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesMemphisMiamiMinnesotaNashvilleNew OrleansNew YorkOklahomaOregonOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghSacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSeattleSt. LouisTampa BayUtahWashington DCWisconsinCanadaCalgaryEdmontonMontrealOttawaTorontoVancouverWinnipegPartnersCollectibles by eBayOdds by BetMGMStreaming by FuboTickets by StubHubSubscribeStart SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionsHQAbout UsCareersCode of ConductEditorial GuidelinesBusiness InquiriesPress InquiriesSupportFAQForgot Password?Contact UsTerms of ServiceNewslettersThe PulseThe BounceThe WindupPrime TireFull TimeUntil SaturdayScoop CityThe Athletic FCMoneyCallRed Light©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times CompanyPrivacy PolicyYour Ad ChoicesSupportSitemap
