I just think I was the better man. You’re not giving him enough credit and trying to take things away from him. He was was 1,000 percent prepared.

So I just stuck to what was working. “How hard did he hit? He didn’t hit as hard as I thought he would.

His feet are slow, keep turning him.
And that's what we did tonight. “We knew what he was trying to do with the wide hooks. He knew I was faster than he thought I was and if he threw a lot of jabs, I was gonna counter it, and I think he respected my power.”September 14, 2025 at 3:03 AM EDTMichael Bailey·Live ReporterCrawford rams home his message Getty ImagesLet’s get into it, as Terence Crawford addressed how he was feeling after such a fantastic night’s work — and what drove him to this point in the first place:💬 “I feel great!
