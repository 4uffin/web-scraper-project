I just think I was the better man. You’re not giving him enough credit and trying to take things away from him. He was was 1,000 percent prepared.

So I just stuck to what was working. “How hard did he hit? He didn’t hit as hard as I thought he would.
He’s definitely technical but, you know, I’ve been hit harder.”AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 3:10 AM EDTMichael Bailey·Live ReporterThe key to Crawford’s winAs for how Terence Crawford dismantled Canelo, this was all pretty revealing — from how he felt about stepping up in weight to his tactics on the night:💬 “I never sparred with smaller guys because I was too strong for them.

His feet are slow, keep turning him.
And that's what we did tonight. “We knew what he was trying to do with the wide hooks. He knew I was faster than he thought I was and if he threw a lot of jabs, I was gonna counter it, and I think he respected my power.”September 14, 2025 at 3:03 AM EDTMichael Bailey·Live ReporterCrawford rams home his message Getty ImagesLet’s get into it, as Terence Crawford addressed how he was feeling after such a fantastic night’s work — and what drove him to this point in the first place:💬 “I feel great!
