Read our Eagles vs Chiefs takeaways here. September 14, 2025 at 7:53 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterQuiet Hurts gameJalen Hurts completed 15-of-22 passes in the Eagles' win today but totaled just 101 yards through the air. That's an average of just 4.6 yards per attempt. He also rushed for 15 yards on nine carries with a touchdown.His stats were rather unimpressive today but he protected the football and Philadelphia got the win.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:51 PM EDTMichael Dominski·Deputy Managing Editor, LiveUnfamiliar position for ChiefsComing into this season, the Chiefs hadn't lost a one-possession game since Week 16 in 2023 vs. the Raiders. They've now lost two straight one-possession games to begin this season. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is 0-2. The last time that Kansas City began the season with two losses was 2014, when the team finished 9-7 and missed the playoffs.September 14, 2025 at 7:49 PM EDTMichael Dominski·Deputy Managing Editor, LiveChiefs in 0-2 holeAs the Chiefs fall to 0-2 on the season, it's worth pointing out that just 12.2% of teams that have started 0-2 since 1990 have made the playoffs (35 teams out of 288). September 14, 2025 at 7:45 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamThis comment from one of our readers has absolutely slayed me. .. Tron ..: Brady looks like he chose poorly what cup to drink in The Last Crusade.September 14, 2025 at 7:45 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterSaquon shinesIt might not have looked like it but Saquon Barkley rushed for 88 yards on 22 carries this afternoon against the Chiefs, including a 13-yard touchdown. That run also happened to be his longest of the night.He really has become absolutely inevitable.September 14, 2025 at 7:39 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterI think a lot of people agree with Joel B.We'll get another look at Justin Herbert tomorrow but he looked very good last week against a Chiefs defense that stymied Jalen Hurts through the air today. AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:35 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterI agree with Jeff D., the Tush Push debate has gone stale.BUT, failing to properly officiate a play that is already unstoppable is also boring and far from ideal.September 14, 2025 at 7:33 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamJoel B.: It’s Justin Herbert’s year in the AFC West. Pretenders are falling away.September 14, 2025 at 7:33 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamJeff D.: Complaining about the Tush Push is getting really old.Marc S.: Wondering if the missed multiple false starts on the TD Tush Push will finally expose it as a point of emphasis for the officials and replay assist? Will be interesting to see how it plays out in the coming weeks. You'd think it was so blatant, it couldn't be ignored (but this is the NFL). And I am a neutral fan here not against the play, per se. But it should be run legally (if that's possible).September 14, 2025 at 7:29 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamM.c. G.: I liked this game better than the Super Bowl. Both team had to work to get their points today…a fight from kickoff to final whistle.Joey R.: Game turned on that Kelce f---up, he's washed and Mahomes ain't the passer he once was. Defense and officiating should keep them relevant though.Stephen S.: Did that washed up jabroni cost KC the game?Jeff D.: The Eagles are the better team, but you knew that.Andrew B.: Eagles barely beat Chiefs team without Rice, Worthy, missed FG and a Kelce dropped TD. September 14, 2025 at 7:28 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterRegarding the Chiefs, I do not think it's time to panic yet but looking ahead, their schedule does not necessarily ease up. There are winnable games against the Giants and Jaguars ahead but Jacksonville is a competitive team and New York showed a lot of fight today in Dallas.That said, Andy Reid and company will need to figure out something in a hurry.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:26 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamMoose W.: Every Eagles game, it's the same issue. Tush Push. Owners need to vote to stop this play. It's not football. It's rugby.Mark F.: Rooting for Eagles but I now wish the Tush Push was banned. The Eagles right guard moves early every time. This play creates such a mass of bodies it is just a joke now.Rrxhn7Pq6J: Finally defend the Tush Push, still give the ball back to the Eagles. F--- this play.Michael D.: Something tells me a lot of fans will be crying about the Tush Push again lmaoHunter J.: The Chiefs don’t deserve to win this game, but I’d love to see a single false start called on the Brotherly Shove. The guards are going early each time. September 14, 2025 at 7:24 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamBradley S.: Eagles' ability to close out games is what separates good teams from great teams. They have shown it time and time again over the last year.Sunny P.: These two teams are in a different weight class at this point, maybe different if Rice and Worthy aren’t out but who knows.Joel B.: Chiefs won’t make the playoffs with this roster. Forget another Super Bowl.September 14, 2025 at 7:23 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterEagles hold off ChiefsFINAL - Eagles 20, Chiefs 17Wait a minute ...Philadelphia runs the Tush Push again looking to ice the game. Jalen Hurts surges forward for the first down but a Chief is at the bottom of the pile with the football.The officials rule that there was no fumble on the play. Looking at the replay, I would tend to agree but I am sure there will be some debate about that one.Instead, the Eagles escape with a road win in this Super Bowl rematch.September 14, 2025 at 7:19 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterThat interception from Mahomes, courtesy of Kelce, was clearly the turning point in this game. That was a massive swing in momentum and points that is almost impossible to overcome.September 14, 2025 at 7:17 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamLots of commenters unimpressed by the roughing the passer penalty the Chiefs benefitted from prior to Mahomes' long touchdown pass to Thornton. Jeff D.: That wasn’t roughing the passer, it was roughing the Mahomes. Different thing.Sam P.: That roughing the passer flag was a complete joke. So was the non-flag on the multiple false starts on the tush push. The NFL product is seriously overrated.John F.: Wow… what a soft call that is.Samuel K.: I don’t like either team but there’s no WAY that Hurts gets that roughing call.Matt K.: Ah here come the phantom flags.AdvertisementSeptember 14, 2025 at 7:16 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamMichael L: “Too little too late for the Chiefs.”Jim P: “That onside kick was complete self sabotage.”David P: “Butker…”September 14, 2025 at 7:14 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamTodd E.: Butker’s missed field goal now looms larger.September 14, 2025 at 7:14 PM EDTThe Athletic Live TeamPaul E.: How do you let anybody get behind you…?
