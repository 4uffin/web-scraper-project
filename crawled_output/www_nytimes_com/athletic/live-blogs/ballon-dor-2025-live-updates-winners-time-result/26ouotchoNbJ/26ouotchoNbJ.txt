GO FURTHERHow Ousmane Dembele won the Ballon d’Or – New role, learning to love tap-ins, and not ‘cheating’September 23, 2025 at 4:51 AM EDTElias Burke·Football WriterOur 2025 Ballon d’Or takeaways Getty ImagesAfter being touted as one of the most wide-open Ballon d’Or races of the past two decades, the event ended up being somewhat of a procession.In front of an expectant crowd, Paris Saint-Germain forward and heavy favourite Ousmane Dembele became the first French player to win the award while playing in Ligue 1 since Jean Pierre-Papin in 1991. On the women’s side, Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati collected her third successive Golden Ball, becoming the first women’s player to achieve that feat, and just the third player ever after Lionel Messi and Michel Platini.The Athletic was at the Theatre du Chatelet, covering the event from the pre-ceremony red carpet to when Dembele was escorted out of the building as hundreds of PSG fans lined the streets chanting his name. Here are five things you may have missed.GO FURTHERBallon d’Or takeaways: Partisan Paris crowd, Dembele streaming PSG, and Gullit’s Wiegman hopeAdvertisementSeptember 22, 2025 at 7:40 PM EDTEd Mackey·Live Editor My Ballon d'Or 2026 winner: Kylian Mbappe Getty ImagesGone are the days where the Ballon d'Or was a shootout between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.When you consider the contenders for next year's award, there are so many options. And it is becoming harder to predict —who would have known 12 months ago that Ousmane Dembele, Lamine Yamal and Vitinha were going to be battling it out?With a glut of genuine challengers, I think it is very likely that the star of the World Cup-winning team will win the Ballon d'Or.So, for that reason, I think Kylian Mbappe will win it. France are among the favourites to win the 2026 World Cup and, after a quieter season last term, it's time for Mbappe to stamp his authority as the best player on the planet.September 22, 2025 at 7:30 PM EDTMax Mathews·Live ReporterMy 2026 Ballon d'Or winner: Mohamed Salah Getty ImagesListening to my heart? I'll go for the romantic choice of Mohamed Salah.For varying reasons, I can see it being someone outside the top 10 this year to win it next year.Pedri, if he stays fit, perhaps. Vinicius Junior and Erling Haaland will improve too, surely.A cheeky top-five shout? Michael Olise.For the Ballon d'Or Feminin, I'll say Naomi Girma.September 22, 2025 at 7:20 PM EDTNancy Froston·Live ReporterMy 2026 Ballon d'Or winner: Lamine Yamal Getty ImagesI think we will see a different winner of this award in 2026, such is the breadth and diversity of the competition in men’s football right now. And my tip at this early stage for the win is Lamine Yamal.Not just because he finished runner-up this year, but because he could go far in the World Cup with Spain — and Barcelona look to be on an upward trajectory, too. Success as part of a team, like for Dembele last season, can be a powerful addition to individual brilliance.September 22, 2025 at 7:09 PM EDTMax Mathews·Live ReporterAnd it's AFCON too! Getty ImagesThe Africa Cup of Nations is a serious major international tournament taking place this season too.Its 35th edition takes place in Morocco across December 2025 and January 2026.That means it's the chance for Egypt's Mohamed Salah, host nation star man Achraf Hakimi, Nigeria's Victor Osimhen or maybe someone else to light up the tournament and deliver some silverware.It could well boost their chances when it comes to next year's Ballon d'Or. And speaking of which...September 22, 2025 at 6:59 PM EDTEd Mackey·Live Editor Do World Cup winners tend to win the Ballon d'Or? Getty ImagesWith that World Cup — on North American soil — in mind, let's take a look to see how much effect the World Cup has had on the Ballon d'Or winner.The Ballon d'Or has only been available to non-Europeans since 1995, so this will only consider the winners since the 1998 World Cup.Did the Ballon d'Or winner win the World Cup?1998 – Yes (Zinedine Zidane, France)2002 – Yes (Ronaldo, Brazil)2006 – Yes (Fabio Cannavaro, Italy)2010 – No (Lionel Messi, Argentina); Spain won the World Cup — Andres Iniesta finished second2014 – No (Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal); Germany won the World Cup – Manuel Neuer finished third2018 – No (Luka Modric, Croatia) – France won the World Cup – Antoine Griezmann finished third2023 – Yes (Lionel Messi, Argentina)AdvertisementSeptember 22, 2025 at 6:51 PM EDTNancy Froston·Live ReporterNext year is a World Cup year... Getty ImagesThat means it’s all to play for when it comes to winning the next edition of the Ballon d'Or. We have seen incredible performances at the tournament be enough to bag this prize — while scooping both in the same year is a rare achievement indeed for any player.And with the World Cup set to be hosted with more teams than ever across three countries in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., it promises to be a bigger occasion than ever to shine.I expect it to play a pretty big role in who we see on the stage holding the trophy this time next year.September 22, 2025 at 6:43 PM EDTNancy Froston·Live ReporterSo close for Lamine Yamal The wry smile on Lamine Yamal’s face when the crowd started chanting Ousmane Dembele’s name (prior to it being read out) suggested the Barcelona man knew the outcome already. But it would have been a remarkable achievement for him to win the overall prize tonight — and even a second place finish should be celebrated. Age is no barrier to taking a seat at the table in the world's best player competition when you're as good as him.It is worth remembering that he won the Kopa Trophy for the second year in a row, too.September 22, 2025 at 6:35 PM EDTMax Mathews·Live Reporter...though not at the topAs Ed mentions, more than half (five out of nine) of the Premier League players in the top 30 finished in the bottom nine names.Gianluigi Donnarumma (9th) and Viktor Gyokeres (15th) weren't playing in England last season.Even Cole Palmer (8th) went through a long spell without scoring last season.That leaves Mohamed Salah (4th) as the only real Premier League contender. And he's 33 years old.September 22, 2025 at 6:30 PM EDTEd Mackey·Live Editor Premier League well represented in the Ballon d'Or... Getty ImagesWe are often told that the Premier League is the best league in the world — and it is becoming increasingly hard to argue with that — but there has only one been one Ballon d'Or winner from an English club since 2009.That man was Rodri last year — his chances of defending his crown were ruined by a serious knee injury that kept him out for the vast majority of last season.Nine Premier League players made the top 30 this year, though only six of them played in the English top flight last term.4.

The arguments will rage on, particularly regarding whether the NWSL in the U.S. gets enough love at global occasions like tonight, or whether European women’s football hogs the spotlight. The eventual winners in both sides of the award are hard to argue with, though.September 22, 2025 at 5:51 PM EDTEd Mackey·Live Editor Not everyone's happy with Bonmati's victory Getty ImagesThe post-ceremony show on CBS has been dominated by the panel's disagreement over who should have won the Ballon d'Or Feminin.No one is denying Bonmati's brilliance, but whether she should have won this year's award is certainly up for debate.Mariona Caldentey was named the Player of the Season in the WSL, which was won by her club — and European champions — Arsenal before she was part of the Spain team that reached the Euros final.Alessia Russo, meanwhile, could have done no more. She too was a key member of that Arsenal team and then helped England to another European crown, scoring their only goal in the final.Bonmati has been the world's best footballer for the last few years, no doubt, but I'm not sure she was the stand-out this season.September 22, 2025 at 5:48 PM EDTEd Mackey·Live Editor It's a Barcelona thing Getty ImagesNo team knows Ballon d'Or success quite like Barcelona.Across the men's and women's awards, they have won it 17 times.Lionel Messi is responsible for six of those, while Aitani Bonmati has three.Load more updatesNationalBoxingBundesligaChampions LeagueChampionshipCollege FootballCollege SportsCopa AmericaCopa del ReyCricketCultureCyclingEuropa LeagueEuropean ChampionshipFA CupFantasy BaseballFantasy BasketballFantasy FootballFantasy HockeyFantasy Premier LeagueFIFA Club World CupFormula 1GamingGlobal SportsGolfInternational FootballLa LigaLeague CupLeague OneLeague TwoMemorabilia & CollectiblesMen's College BasketballMen's World CupMixed Martial ArtsMLBMLSMotorsportsNASCARNBANFLNHLNWSLOlympicsOpinionPeakPremier LeagueSailingScottish PremiershipSerie ASoccerSports BettingSports BusinessTennisTop Sports NewsWNBAWomen's College BasketballWomen's EurosWomen's HockeyWomen's SoccerWomen's World CupThe Athletic InkPodcastsHeadlinesUSArizonaAtlantaBaltimoreBay AreaBostonBuffaloCarolinaChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianaJacksonvilleKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesMemphisMiamiMinnesotaNashvilleNew OrleansNew YorkOklahomaOregonOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghSacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSeattleSt. LouisTampa BayUtahWashington DCWisconsinCanadaCalgaryEdmontonMontrealOttawaTorontoVancouverWinnipegPartnersCollectibles by eBayOdds by BetMGMStreaming by FuboTickets by StubHubSubscribeStart SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionsHQAbout UsCareersCode of ConductEditorial GuidelinesBusiness InquiriesPress InquiriesSupportFAQForgot Password?Contact UsTerms of ServiceNewslettersThe PulseThe BounceThe WindupPrime TireFull TimeUntil SaturdayScoop CityThe Athletic FCMoneyCallRed Light©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times CompanyPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicySupportSitemap
