After a flurry of early scoring, Tampa Bay held a 14-10 lead for over 30 minutes. The Texans took a 19-14 lead with 2:10 left on Nick Chubb’s first touchdown for the team.But their failure to convert the two-point try would prove costly, as Baker Mayfield led the Buccaneers on an 11-play, 80-yard drive, capped by White’s score. Tampa Bay improves to 2-0 for the fifth straight season, while Houston falls to 0-2.

Similar to the AFC South, there’s an undefeated team, a 1-1 team and two franchises that are 0-2. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are atop the division at 2-0, with the Atlanta Falcons at 1-1. The Falcons have the best point differential with 13 while the Bucs are at 4. Tampa’s next game against the Falcons is on Dec. 11. A lot of football left to be played until then, but the Bucs already have the head-to-head edge over the Falcons with their Week 1 victory. September 15, 2025 at 11:05 PM EDTMichael Dominski·Deputy Managing Editor, LiveSignificance of losing GoedekeAccording to Next Gen Stats, Baker Mayfield’s average time to throw fell significantly after right tackle Luke Goedeke left the game in the first quarter due to a foot injury. Mayfield averaged 3.31 seconds to throw with Goedeke compared to 2.23 seconds without him. September 15, 2025 at 11:00 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live ReporterAFC South standings The Athletic Above are the AFC South standings after Week 2. I don’t think many people would have predicted the Indianapolis Colts to be atop the division at 2-0 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in second at 1-1. Yes, the Houston Texans are currently tied with the Tennessee Titans at 0-2. There’s still a lot of football left to be played. And division play hasn’t begun yet. But this is not an ideal start for the Texans. They are currently last in their division for points scored with 28.The first game against the Colts isn’t until Nov. 20. A lot of time between now and then to rally. September 15, 2025 at 10:58 PM EDTMichael Dominski·Deputy Managing Editor, LiveHow unlikely was the Bucs’ comeback?  According to Next Gen Stats, the Buccaneers’ probability of winning this game was as low as 8.8 percent when they were facing fourth-and-10 from their own 32-yard line with 1:24 left in the fourth quarter. That’s when Baker Mayfield scrambled 15 yards for a first down to keep the drive alive.

But Emeka Egbuka is having quite the start to his NFL career. He has three touchdowns in two games. Tonight, he recorded four catches for 29 yards and a touchdown reception.

One big key? The Bucs have ZERO turnovers in the two games. That says a lot about the preparation of this team. It is hard to not turn the ball over in an NFL game. To do it on the road in back to back weeks is impressive.September 15, 2025 at 10:27 PM EDTSaad Yousuf·Staff Writer, NFLTexans couldn’t run the ball Getty ImagesThe issues for Houston begin with a failure to be able to run the ball. Aside from Nick Chubb’s 25-yard touchdown run after the long punt return in the fourth quarter, the Texans had 18 carries for 59 yards. If you take away Chubb’s touchdown run, C.J. Stroud would have been the team’s leading rusher with 27 yards on four attempts. That simply is not good enough. Additionally, Stroud had some questionable moments himself, including a third-down pass in the fourth quarter that hit Bucs linebacker Lavonte David squarely in the hands and would have prevented the Texans from getting a field goal after they blocked a punt. The defense folding to Baker Mayfield on the final drive was far from ideal, but the Texans offense has to wear that loss for Houston.September 15, 2025 at 10:24 PM EDTSaad Yousuf·Staff Writer, NFLEvaluating Houston’s offense Getty ImagesHouston’s offense got off to a fast start, scoring a touchdown on the opening drive of the game followed by a field goal on the second drive. From there, every drive in the second and third quarters ended in a punt, aside from a quick kneel to end the first half. The fourth quarter featured more points for the Texans, but it wasn’t because of a burst of productivity from the offense. The first drive in the fourth quarter ended with the Texans having second-and-goal from the one-yard line. Houston had three tries to get one yard but one rush attempt and two incompletions later, the offense turned it over on downs. Special teams nearly rescued the offensive woes, with a blocked punt setting up a field goal and a big punt return setting up a touchdown run, but the offensive struggles throughout the game were too much to overcome.AdvertisementSeptember 15, 2025 at 10:21 PM EDTSteven Louis Goldstein·Staff Writer, StreamingA tale of two halves Getty ImagesGood football is its own kind of surrealism. Tampa Bay and Houston opened this duel with four straight scores, then put up blanks until the last six minutes of the fourth quarter. The Texans’ pass rush completely choked out game flow ... only for the Bucs’ offense to awaken at the last moment and groove down the field like nothing happened. Seriously, what was that?! These teams matched each other with smooth touchdowns on the first two and final two drives, and left a lot of muck everywhere else. Symmetry that Wes Anderson would dig, and chaos that Salvador Dalí would paint.September 15, 2025 at 10:18 PM EDTAdam Coleman·Staff Editor, NFLTexans takeaways from loss to Bucs Getty ImagesNo other way to put it, that was a crushing loss for the Texans. Houston didn’t get nearly enough offensively, particularly in the run game. While the defense kept the Texans in the game, the Bucs controlled the night with their rushing attack. And Baker Mayfield’s 15-yard run on fourth-and-10 made the biggest difference on that winning drive. The Texans offense is where the issues truly lie moving forward, as a trip to Jacksonville looms next week. It’s Week 2 and certainly not time for sweeping generalizations. But the Texans either look like the same team from last season or worse. Whether or not a Joe Mixon or Christian Kirk return from injury can make a difference is unclear. The Colts are off to a 2-0 start. The AFC South is not a given. Lots of questions need to be answered for the Texans.September 15, 2025 at 10:15 PM EDTDaniel Shirley·Senior Editor, LiveMore pressure tonight Imagn ImagesTampa Bay had one sack in its opener against Atlanta.
