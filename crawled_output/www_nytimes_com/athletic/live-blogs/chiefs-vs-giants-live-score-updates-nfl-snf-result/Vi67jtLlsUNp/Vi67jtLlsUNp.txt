After not scoring a touchdown in the first half, the Chiefs scored two in the second, one by Tyquan Thornton and the other by Kareem Hunt.Patrick Mahomes went 22-of-37 passing for 224 yards and one touchdown in the winning effort. It was another struggling performance for Giants quarterback Russell Wilson, who went 18-of-32 passing for 160 yards, zero touchdowns and two interceptions.With the victory, the Chiefs improve to 1-2 while the Giants fall to 0-3.Send us your thoughts: live@theathletic.comGO FURTHERGiants vs. Chiefs: Russell Wilson flounders as fans chant ‘We want Dart’September 22, 2025 at 1:00 AM EDTJesse Newell·Staff Writer, ChiefsMahomes gets some help Getty Images With Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy still out, the Chiefs’ biggest question heading into the week remained: Who was best equipped to help out Patrick Mahomes as an offensive threat?The Chiefs might’ve gotten their answer after the speedy Tyquan Thornton saved the team late.Leading by seven, K.C. faced a third-and-10 late that presented a tricky situation, given Harrison Butker’s struggles this season.Mahomes — with help — bailed the Chiefs out of that situation by throwing across his body to his new top target.Somehow, Thornton was able to come down with a 33-yard contested reception just in front of the end zone. NFL Next Gen Stats, in fact, said the pass was brought in despite a 15.7-percent completion probability.And though the Chiefs couldn’t have known it at the time, their ability to woo Thornton, a 2022 New England Patriots second-round pick, to the team’s practice squad late last year ended up being one of the team’s top personnel moves for the ensuing season.

The New York Giants quarterback went 18-for-32 for 160 yards and two interceptions in the 22-9 loss to the Chiefs on Sunday night. After his second pick near the end of the first half, fans at MetLife Stadium could be heard chanting, “We want Dart.”
Fans eventually got their wish — for three snaps.Full StorySeptember 22, 2025 at 12:45 AM EDTJesse Newell·Staff Writer, ChiefsDefensive strength emerges Getty Images The Chiefs’ secondary was awful in Week 1 against the Los Angeles Chargers, then dominant the following week in a matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles.So what happened in Week 3?Perhaps the best early-season development for the Chiefs.K.C. once again received a standout effort from its back-end players, led by Jaylen Watson and Chris Roland-Wallace, who both had interceptions — the team’s first two takeaways of the year.Those two weren’t the only ones who played well.Safety Bryan Cook flashed often before leaving the game with a late neck injury, while Chamarri Conner also continued to show improvement following a rough opening week. September 22, 2025 at 12:40 AM EDTJesse Newell·Staff Writer, ChiefsA season-altering drive Imagn ImagesEarlier in the week, Patrick Mahomes said he’d be interested to see how his team would respond to the adversity of an 0-2 start.Turns out, the Chiefs needed to raise the level of difficulty before coming through on their best possession of the year.Though Kansas City appeared to be on the verge of disarray following a first half with numerous penalties and an episode of Andy Reid bumping Travis Kelce on the sideline, Mahomes brought the team some much-needed stability out of the halftime break with a signature drive.K.C. went 74 yards on 11 plays, mixing creativity in the run game with some third-down precision. That included the final dagger, as Mahomes looked off a pass to Kelce before zipping a 5-yard touchdown pass to Tyquan Thornton in the back of the end zone.The critical sequence rebuilt the Chiefs’ lead to 16-6 and kept the season from potentially teetering in an unfortunate direction during a particularly tumultuous moment.September 22, 2025 at 12:35 AM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterA look ahead to 'Monday Night Football' Getty Images Looking ahead to 'Monday Night Football,' we should be in for an exhilarating matchup as the Baltimore Ravens host the Detroit Lions at 8:15 p.m. ET,Detroit is coming off a throttling of the Chicago Bears while Baltimore responded to a tough Week 1 loss with a convincing win over the Cleveland Browns.

I’m not going to answer that," Daboll said Sunday night.This is not the first time this has happened this season, as Daboll alluded to. Daboll was asked to commit to Wilson after the Giants' Week 1 loss, but he declined then, as well. The following day, however, Daboll reaffirmed that Wilson was the starter and said that the QB's status was never in question. It remains to be seen if the same pattern will repeat itself this week.September 21, 2025 at 9:04 PM EDTCharlotte Carroll·Staff Writer, GiantsGiants kicker Graham Gano guts through injury to make field goal For most of Sunday night’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs, it seemed like the New York Giants would be without their primary kicker, Graham Gano. Just before game time, the team announced that Gano was questionable to play with a groin injury. Coach Brian Daboll would later say Gano got hurt while warming up “during the defensive introductions.”
But Gano did end up making an appearance in the fourth quarter, capping a 73-yard Giants drive with a 25-yard field goal. The score trimmed the Chiefs’ lead to 16-9. Gano appeared to be in some pain after making the kick, and he confirmed as much after the game.
“I was in a lot of pain, for sure,” Gano said in the postgame locker room. “But I still feel I didn’t want to put the team in a harder spot not playing at all, so I tried to push through it, and they were definitely concerned, but I told them (at halftime) I could push through and at least make from at least 40 (yards) and in, so that was the plan.”Full StorySeptember 22, 2025 at 12:11 AM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterSkattebo's job to lose? Getty Images Cam Skattebo certainly made the most of his opportunities tonight against a Chiefs defense that is pretty good against the run.The rookie running back rushed for 60 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, including his 13-yard scamper into the end zone. He even caught six passes for 61 yards, leading the team in targets, receptions and yardage.September 22, 2025 at 12:07 AM EDTLukas Weese·Live ReporterYour postgame views Getty Images Below are your postgame views on the Chiefs' win over the Giants.Paul H.: Congrats to the Chiefs on the win but could someone be sure to shove that game down the disposal? Wyatt L.: Putting out Russell Wilson week after week; drive after drive for the sake of “A proven veteran” to mentor the rookie is false competence.G F E: Wilson had a great run with Seattle. Those were the days. These aren't.Ab B.: If Russ is starting next week, I'm finding something else to do while the Giants play.John E.: I think the question is very quickly becoming does Mara for a second time fire a head coach during the season? I'll say no but I'm certain he's thinking about it.AdvertisementSeptember 22, 2025 at 12:03 AM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterTime for Dart? Getty Images Russell Wilson's 450-yard performance against the Cowboys in Week 2 might have been a mirage.The veteran quarterback was bad tonight, completing 18-of-32 passes for 160 yards with two terrible interceptions. Both were deep throws that basically ended up being arm punts to Chiefs defenders.Wilson has become too reliant on the deep ball and is therefore quite predictable, making the Giants easy to defend (unless you're the Dallas Cowboys).Jaxson Dart might not start next week but his time is certainly approaching ...September 21, 2025 at 11:59 PM EDTJim Ayello·Staff Editor, NFLOdd Jones response on Wilson Getty Images Kansas Chiefs star Chris Jones told NBC's Melissa Stark that he's asked Giants QB Russell Wilson multiple times to do a jersey swap with him after games. Jones said he's never gotten one from Wilson, and when Stark asked him if he tried to get Wilson's jersey tonight, Jones said, "I don't even want it. It's all good." Over time, you understand that over time, yeah, I don't even want it."Jones tallied a sack against Wilson tonight. He now has 81.5 sacks for his career.September 21, 2025 at 11:55 PM EDTLukas Weese·Live ReporterFinal stats Getty Images First downs: Chiefs: 22Giants: 19Total plays: Chiefs: 67Giants: 61Total yards: Chiefs: 306Giants: 281 Total rushing yards: Chiefs: 105Giants: 130Total passing yards: Chiefs: 201Giants: 151 Penalties: Chiefs: 8Giants: 7Time of possession: Chiefs: 31:50Giants: 28:10 September 21, 2025 at 11:51 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterThornton keeps producing Getty Images Tyquan Thornton led the Chiefs in targets, receptions and yards, finishing the night with five catches for 71 yards and a touchdown.He caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes in the third quarter and the pair nearly connected on a second score in the fourth quarter. Thornton dropped the first potential touchdown and then made a nice snag on the next play but was brought down at the 1-yard line.He has now scored a touchdown in two straight games.September 21, 2025 at 11:48 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterProgress from Pacheco Getty Images The bar is low but progress is progress. Isiah Pacheco had his best game of the season so far, rushing for 45 yards on 10 carries. He also caught a pass for three yards.Again, it's a low bar to clear but he showed his burst at times tonight, breaking off a few runs that serve as a reminder for what he remains capable of.

As Kelce returned to the Chiefs bench following a series in the first half, broadcast cameras captured the star and his coach arguing. Reid bumped into Kelce during the exchange. The two continued to have a seemingly intense conversation as they walked down the sideline.
Reid was asked about the frustration of his star players at halftime and told NBC, “That’s OK, we need some juice, so that’s good.”Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 11:42 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterQuiet night for RobinsonAfter catching eight passes for 142 yards and a touchdown in Week 2, Kansas City held Wan'Dale Robinson in check tonight.The wideout caught just one pass for 26 yards on three targets.September 21, 2025 at 11:39 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterTracy injured in loss Getty Images Tyrone Tracy was off to a strong start tonight, involved heavily on the Giants first drive but his night was cut short after exiting with a shoulder injury.
