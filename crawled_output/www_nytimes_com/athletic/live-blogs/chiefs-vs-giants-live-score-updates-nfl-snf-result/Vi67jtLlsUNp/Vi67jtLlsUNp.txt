He has a wrap around his leg and is sitting on New York's bench. If he can't play, punter Jamie Gillan will handle all kicking duties. That leaves wide receiver/kick returner Gunner Olszewski as the next man up as the team's holder.AdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 9:17 PM EDTJesse Newell·Staff Writer, Chiefs Imagn ImagesThe Chiefs had just 68 yards after catch against the Philadelphia Eagles last week, which was the lowest mark in quarterback Patrick Mahomes' 134 starts. So far tonight? According to Pro Football Focus' preliminary numbers, the Chiefs have 68 yards after catch ... in their first two drives. That's much more like a coach Andy Reid offense, as he typically thrives creating space openings to allow his team to throw short before running long.September 21, 2025 at 9:17 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterWilson intercepted Getty Images Q2 8:43 - Chiefs 6, Giants 0That looks frustratingly familiar for Giants fans.

Just before game time, kicker Graham Gano was ruled questionable with a groin injury.
With the Giants’ offense getting the ball first, we got an early look at how the situation would play out. As the offense marched up the field, Gano was warming up on the sidelines, kicking a bit. But Gano headed to the bench, and punter Jamie Gillan started kicking into the net.Full StorySeptember 21, 2025 at 9:09 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live ReporterButker FG Imagn ImagesQ2 9:48 - Chiefs 6, Giants 0On third-and-12, Patrick Mahomes scrambles for 14 yards, appearing to move the chains but the gain is negated by an illegal formation penalty.On third-and-17, Mahomes finds Noah Gray for 10 yards, setting up a 48-yard field goal attempt from Butker.He converts to extend the Chiefs lead.September 21, 2025 at 9:06 PM EDTDan Duggan·Senior Writer, GiantsGoing back through my pregame notes, Gano attempted three field goals from the 49/50 in one direction, which is unusual. He typically takes one kick at a spot and then moves back 3-4 yards for the next. Kicks didn't have as much distance as usual, but had no reason to suspect.AdvertisementSeptember 21, 2025 at 9:06 PM EDTMichael Charles·Live Reporter Imagn ImagesQ2 13:09 - Chiefs 3, Giants 0Classic Mahomes right there, dancing around the pocket to buy time before rolling out to his right and firing a strike to JuJu Smith-Schuster for a gain of 27 yards into Giants territory.

September 21, 2025 at 8:48 PM EDTJesse Newell·Staff Writer, ChiefsThe Chiefs take an early 3-0 lead, and the first two drives tonight are a good example of why we shouldn't read too much into the Chiefs' point-per-game totals being down the last two seasons. Yes, K.C.'s offense hasn't been as good since receiver Tyreek Hill was traded, but it's also difficult to rack up too many points when the Chiefs offense and defense both play a style that produces long drives. The Giants came up empty on a 10-play possession, then the Chiefs answered with a field goal on a 12-snap drive. The result is that we're almost all the way through the first quarter, with both sides just now completing their first time time touching the ball.Load more updatesNationalBoxingBundesligaChampions LeagueChampionshipCollege FootballCollege SportsCopa AmericaCopa del ReyCricketCultureCyclingEuropa LeagueEuropean ChampionshipFA CupFantasy BaseballFantasy BasketballFantasy FootballFantasy HockeyFantasy Premier LeagueFIFA Club World CupFormula 1GamingGlobal SportsGolfInternational FootballLa LigaLeague CupLeague OneLeague TwoMemorabilia & CollectiblesMen's College BasketballMen's World CupMixed Martial ArtsMLBMLSMotorsportsNASCARNBANFLNHLNWSLOlympicsOpinionPeakPremier LeagueSailingScottish PremiershipSerie ASoccerSports BettingSports BusinessTennisTop Sports NewsWNBAWomen's College BasketballWomen's EurosWomen's HockeyWomen's SoccerWomen's World CupThe Athletic InkPodcastsHeadlinesUSArizonaAtlantaBaltimoreBay AreaBostonBuffaloCarolinaChicagoCincinnatiClevelandColumbusDallasDenverDetroitHoustonIndianaJacksonvilleKansas CityLas VegasLos AngelesMemphisMiamiMinnesotaNashvilleNew OrleansNew YorkOklahomaOregonOrlandoPhiladelphiaPittsburghSacramentoSan AntonioSan DiegoSeattleSt. LouisTampa BayUtahWashington DCWisconsinCanadaCalgaryEdmontonMontrealOttawaTorontoVancouverWinnipegPartnersCollectibles by eBayOdds by BetMGMStreaming by FuboTickets by StubHubSubscribeStart SubscriptionGroup SubscriptionsHQAbout UsCareersCode of ConductEditorial GuidelinesBusiness InquiriesPress InquiriesSupportFAQForgot Password?Contact UsTerms of ServiceNewslettersThe PulseThe BounceThe WindupPrime TireFull TimeUntil SaturdayScoop CityThe Athletic FCMoneyCallRed Light©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times CompanyPrivacy PolicyYour Ad ChoicesSupportSitemap
