On the men‚Äôs side, Bolt‚Äôs countryman Oblique Seville surged past fellow Jamaican Kishane Thompson to win gold and get a long-anticipated breakthrough in a major race.AdvertisementThe win capped an undefeated year for Jefferson-Wooden, who first passed Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson as the clear American No. 1 and seemed destined to cash in with a world title this week. She left no doubt, pulling away halfway through the race and leaving a sizeable gap behind her at the finish line.

Olympic champion Julien Alfred of St. Lucia took bronze in 10.84.‚ÄúI felt myself get out [ahead], then I blacked out after that, thinking ‚Äòget to the line‚Äô,‚Äù Jefferson-Wooden told BBC Sport. ‚ÄúI saw my time and it hit me, oh my gosh I won!‚ÄúI came in as a hunter, I‚Äôve never been a world champion or Olympic champion in the 100m. There will be a target on my back next year so I‚Äôll work out how to navigate that.‚ÄùJamaica‚Äôs Shericka Jackson took fourth in 10.88. American Sha‚ÄôCarri Richardson, the defending world champion, was fifth in 10.94.Jamaican legend Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce, competing in her final meet, finished sixth.

It was the first major international medal for the 24-year-old. Thompson took silver in 9.82, with Lyles ‚Äî who won Olympic gold in a photo finish over Thompson ‚Äî in bronze position in 9.89.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an excellent feeling,‚Äù Seville told BBC Sport. ‚ÄúThe last time a Jamaican got the title was in 2016 and that was Usain Bolt so I am really happy knowing that I actually got the gold medal and I have proved myself that I am a true competitor and I showed my resilience and my fight and determination.Advertisement‚ÄúEveryone was saying in the first round that I am panicking, but I know what I am going through in that moment and I just brushed it aside and proved to myself that I am the champion.‚ÄùAmerican Kenny Bednarek struggled out of the blocks and finished fourth in 9.92. Botswana‚Äôs Letsile Tebogo, the Olympic 200-meter champion, jumped early and was disqualified.
