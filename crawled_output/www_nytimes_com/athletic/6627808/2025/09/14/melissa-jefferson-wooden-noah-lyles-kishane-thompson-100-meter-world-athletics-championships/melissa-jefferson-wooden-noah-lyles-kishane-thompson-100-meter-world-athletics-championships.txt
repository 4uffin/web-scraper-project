Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, Oblique Seville win 100-meter titles at world championships - The AthleticOlympicsMelissa Jefferson-Wooden, Oblique Seville win 100-meter titles at world championshipsBy Zack PierceSept. 14, 2025Share15With Jamaica’s Usain Bolt, the greatest sprinter of all time, watching, two current faces of the event scored their biggest wins yet Sunday at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo.American Melissa Jefferson-Wooden won gold in the women’s 100-meter, running a championship-record 10.61 seconds to easily beat a loaded field that featured the entire podium from the Paris Olympics and cement her place as the new queen of the 100-meter. On the men’s side, Bolt’s countryman Oblique Seville surged past fellow Jamaican Kishane Thompson to win gold and get a long-anticipated breakthrough in a major race.AdvertisementThe win capped an undefeated year for Jefferson-Wooden, who first passed Sha’Carri Richardson as the clear American No. 1 and seemed destined to cash in with a world title this week. She left no doubt, pulling away halfway through the race and leaving a sizeable gap behind her at the finish line.

— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) September 14, 2025Jamaica’s Tina Clayton, 21, became the youngest world championship medalist in the 100-meter, earning silver in 10.76. Olympic champion Julien Alfred of St. Lucia took bronze in 10.84.“I felt myself get out [ahead], then I blacked out after that, thinking ‘get to the line’,” Jefferson-Wooden told BBC Sport. “I saw my time and it hit me, oh my gosh I won!“I came in as a hunter, I’ve never been a world champion or Olympic champion in the 100m. There will be a target on my back next year so I’ll work out how to navigate that.”Jamaica’s Shericka Jackson took fourth in 10.88. American Sha’Carri Richardson, the defending world champion, was fifth in 10.94.Jamaican legend Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce, competing in her final meet, finished sixth. The 38-year-old, winner of two Olympic and five world championship 100-meter golds, was forced to scratch the 100-meter semifinal at the Paris Olympics and came back for one more run at a top prize.Seville won gold in a personal-best 9.77, charging past Thompson and American Noah Lyles in the final stretch. It was the first major international medal for the 24-year-old. Thompson took silver in 9.82, with Lyles — who won Olympic gold in a photo finish over Thompson — in bronze position in 9.89.“It’s an excellent feeling,” Seville told BBC Sport. “The last time a Jamaican got the title was in 2016 and that was Usain Bolt so I am really happy knowing that I actually got the gold medal and I have proved myself that I am a true competitor and I showed my resilience and my fight and determination.Advertisement“Everyone was saying in the first round that I am panicking, but I know what I am going through in that moment and I just brushed it aside and proved to myself that I am the champion.”American Kenny Bednarek struggled out of the blocks and finished fourth in 9.92. Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo, the Olympic 200-meter champion, jumped early and was disqualified.
