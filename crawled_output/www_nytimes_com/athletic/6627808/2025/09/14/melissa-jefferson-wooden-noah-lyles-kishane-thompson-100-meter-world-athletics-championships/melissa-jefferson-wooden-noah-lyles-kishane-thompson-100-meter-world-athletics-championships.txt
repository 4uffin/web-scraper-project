On the men’s side, Bolt’s countryman Oblique Seville surged past fellow Jamaican Kishane Thompson to win gold and get a long-anticipated breakthrough in a major race.AdvertisementThe win capped an undefeated year for Jefferson-Wooden, who first passed Sha’Carri Richardson as the clear American No. 1 and seemed destined to cash in with a world title this week. She left no doubt, pulling away halfway through the race and leaving a sizeable gap behind her at the finish line.
