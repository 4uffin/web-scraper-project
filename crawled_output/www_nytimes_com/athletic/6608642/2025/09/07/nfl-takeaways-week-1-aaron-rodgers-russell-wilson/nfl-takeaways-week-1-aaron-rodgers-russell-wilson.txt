Is this finally the year Jackson or Allen gets their team over the hump and knocks Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs off their lofty AFC perch?
What impressed you most about the Packers’ dominant victory over the Lions?Pompei: It was a complete victory against an opponent that was one of the best teams in football last year, a statement game. The Packers did everything well and established themselves as the favorite in the NFC North if they weren’t considered the favorite already. They outplayed the Lions every way they could. No team held the Lions to fewer than 16 points last season, so being held to 13 by Green Bay could be an indication the Packers’ D is really good, and that the Lions are missing former offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and retired center Frank Ragnow.Jones: I had no doubt that the offense would come out of the gates with a solid performance, but I really was curious about their defense against a potent Lions offense. Yes, Ben Johnson is gone. But there’s still a lot of talent on that offense. ​​Green Bay’s defense was absolutely suffocating, holding Jahmyr Gibbs (one of the most dynamic running backs in the game) and David Montgomery to a combined 44 yards. The Lions managed to convert only five of 15 third downs and scored only six points until the final minute of the game. We knew there could be some growing pains under first-time offensive coordinator John Morton, but the Packers thoroughly dominated.Nguyen: Their run defense was stifling. The Lions’ offensive line isn’t what it used to be after center Frank Ragnow retired, but this should still be an elite run game. There were some questions about how the Packers run defense would look like without defensive tackle Kenny Clark and with the addition of Micah Parsons, whom Jerry Jones is doing his best to paint as a bad run defender. The Packers held the Lions to 46 yards on 22 carries (2.1 YPA). Without their run game, Jared Goff had to play off schedule, and the Packers were able to pressure consistently. If they defend the run at this level every week, this is going to be a hard defense to move the ball against.What conclusions can you draw from Aaron Rodgers and the new-look Pittsburgh Steelers rallying to beat Justin Fields and the new-look New York Jets?Jones: One of the things that really stood out was how comfortable Rodgers looked. That’s a big testament to Arthur Smith, who gained a good understanding of the offensive concepts that suit Rodgers’ game well and blended them with Pittsburgh’s philosophies. The Steelers still clearly have offensive line issues. Rodgers was sacked four times and hit six other times. But Smith did a good job of using the play-action attack and rolling Rodgers out to limit the number of times his 41-year-old quarterback was a sitting target. And then, Rodgers’ poise and feel for the game proved to be a difference-maker with the game on the line.AdvertisementNguyen: Rodgers looks healthier and was lethal running the same boot concept over and over against the Jets. Two of his touchdown passes were off boots, but that’s one of the things that makes him special: his ability to throw on the move. Aside from Rodgers, Calvin Austin’s game was encouraging. They needed a complement for DK Metcalf, and Austin looks like he’s up for the job, catching four passes for 70 yards and a touchdown.Pompei: Rodgers looks rejuvenated. But he’s going to need more help over time to keep winning. If he has to put up 34 points every week and endure four sacks, he’s not going to maintain that level of play. Rodgers can have a really good season, but at 41, more than ever, he’s going to need help from his defense and his offensive line. It appears Rodgers has quickly developed chemistry with Smith, his play caller, and Austin, which could be a significant factor.

— NFL (@NFL) September 7, 2025Russell Wilson made a less-than-impressive New York Giants debut in a loss to the Washington Commanders. How patient should coach Brian Daboll be before giving rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart a shot?Pompei: The contrast between Wilson and Jayden Daniels was stunning. It doesn’t appear Wilson is going to help the Giants go where they want to go. Daboll needs to win. He’s not going to stay with Wilson for long if the veteran continues to perform the way he did, and he shouldn’t. Playing Dart probably would be best for the Giants in the short term and long term. If Dart is who the Giants think he is, Dart might make the Giants better this season, and playing as a rookie could expedite his development.Jones: Daboll is coaching for his life and can’t afford to wait very long with Wilson. It really feels like Daboll wants to go to Dart but wants to ensure he is as prepared as possible. He hoped Wilson could manage the offense long enough to buy Dart more time. But he might have to re-evaluate his plan. The Giants have a tough opening stretch: at Washington, at the Dallas Cowboys, versus the Kansas City Chiefs and versus the Los Angeles Chargers. Daboll might be eyeing that New Orleans Saints game in Week 5 as a good Dart debut spot if things aren’t going well with Wilson.Nguyen: Daboll should stay as patient as possible and hold off until near the end of the season if he can. This offensive line, especially without Andrew Thomas, is not good, and they don’t want to put Dart in a situation where he’s learning bad habits. With the toughest schedule in football, they have to take their blows for the good of Dart. But the reality is Wilson might not have a lot of leeway. The defense held up, so if they continue to have low-scoring games in which the offense is ineffective, it’ll be extremely tempting to throw Dart in.How do you assess the NFC West race after the 49ers escaped the Seahawks and the Rams and Cardinals started 1-0?Nguyen: Too early to tell. The Cardinals beat a bad Saints team but the Rams, Seahawks and 49ers all played against tough competition. The Rams beat the Texans, who were a playoff team last year and have one of the best defenses in the league, and the 49ers and Seahawks played each other in a back-and-forth game that ended with a 49ers win after Sam Darnold fumbled the ball on his tackle’s butt in the red zone. The 49ers probably have a step on the rest with a divisional win on the road.AdvertisementJones: I think the only conclusion that we can take away after one week is that the NFC West very well could go down to the wire. Each of these four teams’ performances showed both promise and the need for improvement. All of them have the potential to be really solid, but I don’t think there’s one clear-cut leader of the pack. We will likely see divisional lead changes every couple of weeks and then a fight to the finish for the crown and playoff spots.Pompei: This is not a division that will be decided in the first week of the season, or probably the 17th week. The bet here is the NFC West will come down to the final week of play, when the Cardinals and Rams square off and the Seahawks play the 49ers. It remains to be seen if the Cardinals have what it takes, but the other three teams all could win the division, or at least make the playoffs. A healthy Matthew Stafford could give the Rams the edge.Are the Dolphins this bad, or are the Daniel Jones-led Indianapolis Colts this good?Nguyen: The Colts were getting wide-open receivers against the Dolphins, who might have the worst secondary in football. Still, you can see why they went to Jones, who hit those open receivers with accuracy and timing, as the starter over Anthony Richardson. It’ll take more than one game for Jones to change people’s minds about him, but it was an encouraging start. Colts coach Shane Steichen, who was rated as a top-10 play caller by defensive coaches, flexed his muscles. He called a great game. With Jones, he has someone who can operate his offense on schedule.Jones: The Dolphins looked astonishingly bad. Mike McDaniel is supposed to be an offensive genius, yet three turnovers and 8 points suggest otherwise. Tua Tagovailoa had all three turnovers. Equally concerning was how toothless Miami’s defense was, and for once, McDaniel didn’t make a change at defensive coordinator, so continuity was supposed to lend itself to more improvement. Instead, it looks as if the once-promising coach has lost his touch. Jones did indeed look comfortable running the offense. A strong run game (156 rushing yards Sunday) is his best friend, as we saw during his best season with the Giants. But Sunday’s results had more to do with the ineptitude of the Dolphins than actual newfound excellence by Jones.Pompei: It seems this was one of those weird Week 1 games that defy explanation, right? Maybe the Dolphins are worse than expected and maybe the Colts are better. But it’s hard to believe the Colts would beat this team by 25 points if they played again. We could be seeing a Sam Darnoldization of Jones, however. Time, failure, a new scheme and a different environment appear to have been good for him. It will be interesting to see whether he continues his revival against the Denver Broncos.Plenty of rookies made the highlights Sunday. Which one stood out to you?Pompei: The Bucs’ Emeka Egbuka was picked 19th, but he could be the offensive rookie of the year. It’s unusual for a rookie wide receiver to look like a veteran, but that’s what Egbuka did in his two-touchdown performance against the Atlanta Falcons on the road. The fact Baker Mayfield had no hesitation to go to him with the game on the line and 59 seconds left spoke volumes. In a game with Mike Evans, Drake London and Kyle Pitts, Egbuka was the most productive receiver on the field.Jones: I was going to say Egbuka, who impressed in his Bucs debut. He really showed why Bucs coaches and officials were so high on him during training camp. But since Pompei picked him, I’ll give Washington running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt some love. The seventh-rounder, who likes to go by “Bill,” impressed his coaches enough during the preseason to prompt them to part with Brian Robinson Jr., their top back the last three seasons. Croskey-Merritt carried the ball 10 times for 82 yards and a touchdown, including a 42-yarder. He showed he can do it all. He churned out tough yards up the middle, and he also showed he has the speed to get to the perimeter, turn the corner on defenders and race upfield. Bill is the perfect player for Kliff Kingsbury’s offense.AdvertisementNguyen: Tyler Warren looks as advertised. What a debut for him. He led the Colts in targets (9) and catches (7) for 76 yards. He caught passes downfield and rumbled after the catch. He even had a carry, which he did effectively at Penn State. The Colts have a lot of mouths to feed on offense, but it looks like Warren is going to have a consistent role.(Photo of Jayden Reed: Jeff Hanisch / Imagn Images)
