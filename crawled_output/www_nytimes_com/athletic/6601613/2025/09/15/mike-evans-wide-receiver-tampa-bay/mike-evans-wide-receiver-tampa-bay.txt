Mike Evans was 9 years old when a police officer woke him in the middle of the night. There was a dead man on the street outside. The victim had been shot square in the forehead, execution-style, and stabbed 27 times.Advertisement“Mikey saw his daddy on the ground that night,” a family friend, Terry Petteway, says. “You don’t forget that.”Or maybe it was fear that his father wouldn’t be proud of him, even after he was gone. Dad coached him from the beginning: Mikey was doing push-ups at 4 years old and working on his jump shot at 6. He still remembers the time he fumbled a kickoff and cost his team the game in his Hurricanes youth football league. “Hold that ball with your outside arm,” dad told him on the way home, “so they can’t punch it free.”Mikey remembers this because it was the day his father was murdered.“I swear, after he died, I just started to hear him more,” Evans says.Maybe it was rage, because something changed in that 9-year-old boy. “Sports became my drug,” he says now. He played in a football game a few hours after the funeral, lining up at defensive end and ignoring his coach’s pleas to set the edge — no, Mikey was going straight through the offensive line. “Made all the tackles and scored all the touchdowns that day,” Petteway remembers. His sister would later recall him visiting his father’s gravesite and doing push-ups in the rain.He’d cry when no one was looking, all the way through college, wishing his father could’ve been there for the climb. But deep down, he knew what all that hurt had left him with: a callus that was never going away. Mike Evans won’t apologize for that. Save your pity for someone else.“I don’t use that sh— as a crutch,” he says. “I don’t like people feeling sorry for me. I never have.”Mike Evans Sr. was a devoted father but a violent man. Once, when he showed up to one of his son’s football games after a long absence, Petteway asked where he’d been. Evans shrugged. “Outta town,” he mumbled. Petteway knew what that meant.Evans had served three years in prison for assault, then a 30-day stint after hitting Mike’s mother, Heather Kilgore, with a beer can, cutting her lip and chipping her tooth, police records show. Their relationship began when both were teenagers — Heather gave birth to Mike when she was 14 and Mike Sr. was 19 — and grew volatile over time.AdvertisementOne night, Heather’s brother Sam Kilgore, who was living with the family, snapped. It started with a gunshot in the living room while the children slept inside the Galveston, Texas, home, and ended with Kilgore dragging Evans on the asphalt outside, emptying a .32-caliber pistol into his forehead, then stabbing him over and over until blood pooled on the street.Kilgore confessed to the crime six days later. “I wanted to make sure he was dead,” he told detectives.The fury that filled Mike at first — he tore up his uncle’s bedroom in anger — faded over time. He convinced himself he had to bury the pain. He rarely spoke of what happened. “To this day, he’s never expressed to me what it was like going through that,” Petteway says. “Not once.”Mike tried to grasp his uncle’s motive, and as he grew older, finally did. “He was doing what he thought was best for his sister,” he says now. “He was protecting her.” At his mother’s urging, he visited his uncle in prison. He spoke to him over the phone. In time, he found it in himself to forgive.“There’s no excuse to kill someone, murder someone,” Evans says now. “But faith plays a big part in everything I do. I’ve always been forgiven. I’m not perfect. I’ve had plenty of f—ups. He’s still family.”Still, the agony needed an outlet. For Evans, sports became therapy, the fields and courts around Galveston his refuge. It was his way of connecting with the father whose validation he never stopped chasing.For years, basketball held the tightest pull and was his most likely path to a college scholarship, but the officiating drove him nuts. “High school refs and their touch fouls,” Evans bristles, still heated about those whistles a decade and a half later. The kid was too physical for his own good.He was also too stubborn to see a different route. Evans had walked out after a single football practice his sophomore year, after he’d shown up for two-a-days without packing a lunch — “I didn’t know we needed one!” — and cramped his way through 40 40-yard sprints to close the workout. “You’re supposed to be at the front!” a coach screamed at him. “You’re a wide receiver!” Evans trudged a mile home in the 100-degree Texas heat, sweating, starving and vowing to never play again.AdvertisementHis friends begged him to reconsider. As a senior, he finally did. This time, his physicality found a home. Evans piled up seven touchdowns and 648 receiving yards for a team that went 1-9. Scouts could see the untapped talent, the footwork that carried over from the basketball court and the ease at which he won the ball in the air. Offers trickled in. Evans realized football was his ticket. He signed with Texas A&M.
He redshirted in 2011, then gutted through a torn hamstring a year later — “I was hobbling the entire second half of the season,” Evans says — to set freshman receiving records in catches (82) and yards (1,105). In 2013 he was an All-American.By the spring of 2014, Jason Licht was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ newly hired general manager. He spent his first few months on the job locked in his office, poring through draft prospects. Licht had the seventh pick, and the Bucs needed a quarterback. The player he couldn’t stop watching was Johnny Manziel. Then, after a while, it hit him.Maybe this receiver is actually the guy.

(Wesley Hitt / Getty Images)Evans was all energy and aggression at first, impatient and undisciplined. As a rookie in Tampa, he’d bark at teammates in practice, then get into screaming matches with the refs during games. He’d slam his helmet if he dropped a pass. He’d punch the ground.The rage was still in him.“Wild sh—,” Evans calls it now. “Like, stuff that was almost hurting the team.”Then a voice broke through. It belonged to the veteran receiver.“You need to home that in,” Vincent Jackson urged him.Evans listened because in Jackson he saw the template. Jackson was nine years in. He’d piled up five 1,000-yard seasons. He’d made three Pro Bowls. He was a model of class and consistency.The vet saw a rookie drenched in talent and willing to work. What Evans needed, Jackson decided, was a voice in his ear.Advertisement“You’re out of college and you don’t have any real structure,” Evans admits now. “You’ve got a little money for the first time and you’re ordering steaks every night. You’re starting to drink a little more. That’s why my weight was so high …”“Mike was young,” Licht says. “He had to learn.”Evans played at 240 pounds his first few seasons. By Year 3, Jackson’s influence started to take hold. “You need to stay in shape year-round,” he stressed to Evans, “that way you won’t get hurt.” To this day Evans’ offseason training program commences two weeks after his last game, no questions asked.He dropped to 220. He copied Jackson’s routine. He learned to temper his aggression in practice, then unleash it on game day.“Vince was helping me with this stuff while I was taking targets from him,” Evans says. “He was my big brother in this league.”Jackson’s career dwindled while Evans’ took off. He became one of the best receivers in the game, stacking 1,000-yard seasons, year after year, no matter who was throwing it to him: Josh McCown, Mike Glennon, Jameis Winston, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Tom Brady, Baker Mayfield. For a franchise long known for defense — all five Bucs Hall of Famers played on that side of the ball — Evans became an anchor of offensive consistency, perhaps overlooked and underappreciated on a national scale but beloved in the town where he made his name.He became a pillar in the organization and city. Along with his wife, Ashli, he formed the Mike Evans Family Foundation, which serves youth throughout Tampa — as well as domestic violence victims, a cause that remains deeply personal to him. Heather Kilgore, always in her No. 13 jersey, has been a fixture at Bucs games for years.“Now that I have a family of my own, I look back and think, ‘I have no idea how she did it,'” Mike says. “She was a hospital clerk. How did she afford stuff? There was never a Christmas that went by where we didn’t have presents under the tree.”AdvertisementTwelve years in, Licht’s first draft pick is now the franchise’s all-time leader in catches and yards. Last January, Evans recorded his 11th straight 1,000-yard season, tying an NFL record held by Jerry Rice. After the catch, the celebration and the win, Evans marched into the locker room while the crowd roared. “A top-five Bucs moment since I’ve been here,” his GM says.Evans hasn’t finished a season with fewer than 1,000 yards since his senior year of high school.Still, he refuses to let satisfaction seep in. “People hear consistency and they think that’s all I am,” he says, getting a bit heated. “Consistency is great, but I think I’m the best. I know a lot of guys in my situation couldn’t come close to what I’ve done. Come to Tampa, a team not known for offense … revolving door at quarterback … the most doubled receiver in the league since 2015 …”He stops himself.“I want to be known as a winner.”That status is hard to argue. The Bucs have claimed four straight NFC South titles, and in February 2021, with Brady helming the offense, celebrated a Super Bowl triumph on their home field. “That’s what we wanted!” Evans screamed at Brady while the confetti fell around them.

(Mike Ehrmann / Getty Images)Eight days later, Evans was back in Houston, celebrating with family, when the texts started to flash across his screen.“Is this sh— true about Vincent?”“I can’t believe this. Not VJ.”“No. No. No. No. No.”Evans locked himself in his bathroom. He felt tears rolling down his cheeks. He called an old coach, bracing for the worst. Then he heard it. Jackson was gone, found dead in a hotel room, at age 38.“Your heart drops,” Evans says. “It was so unexpected because of how he conducted himself. He had a family. He had money. He had a great career, a great life.”Jackson, who’d been reported missing by his family five days prior, was determined to have died from chronic alcohol use, a medical examiner later determined. He also was suffering from Stage 2 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.AdvertisementIn the days that followed, Evans’ mind went back to the conversations they’d shared — on the practice field and the sideline, in the locker room and over long dinners after Jackson had moved on from the game. “You motivated me more than you know,” he’d tell Evans.Jackson’s words shaped how Evans worked and how he led. He decided early on that if he lasted in the league as long as his mentor had, he’d treat his young teammates the same way. He’d coach and counsel and pull them along, just as Vincent Jackson had done with him.“That’s exactly how it worked,” Chris Godwin says.Godwin arrived in Tampa in 2017. Three years later, he led the team in receiving. Two years after that, he did so again. Godwin is now entering his ninth season. Evans is one of the reasons he’s still a Buc.“Mike never made me feel like, ‘Hey, if I wanna be the leading receiver on a team, I gotta go somewhere else to do that,'” Godwin says. “He welcomed me into the room. He allowed me to be a sponge. He helped me become the player I am.”The result: a rare and refreshing duo built on selflessness at a position that can sometimes be sabotaged by ego and accolades.“There’s something to be said for two receivers of our caliber playing together for nine years without any drama,” Godwin says.For Evans, it goes back to the template Jackson left him. That became the roadmap, and it’s one he still follows. He’ll call out a teammate if he catches him scrolling through his phone in a meeting. He’ll do the same if he hears one of them chirping back at a position coach during practice — something he was guilty of early on.He still works like a late-round pick hoping to make the roster; Evans loses six or seven pounds every practice, and it’s more than just the Tampa humidity. He refuses to take a rep off.Advertisement“You can see it in his eyes,” says Bucs cornerback Zyon McCollum, a Galveston native who grew up idolizing Evans. “If you wanna win a rep against him, you have to attack him. Ain’t no freebies, ain’t no gimmes with Mike. No way.”“We had to force him to take a day off in training camp,” adds Licht, shaking his head. Asked why he believes Evans won’t rest on his laurels, even at this stage of his career, the GM goes quiet for a moment. Finally, he shrugs his shoulders.“Why is Michael Jordan Michael Jordan?” he says. “I don’t know. He’s just wired different than the rest.”Evans has never missed more than three games in a season. Another 1,000-yard campaign and he’ll be the sole owner of an NFL record once thought untouchable. “It’s so incredibly difficult to get 1,000 yards in this league,” Godwin says. “And to do it every year of your career? And tie Jerry Rice? That’s some top-tier sh—, man.”As he inches into Year 12 — Evans had five catches for 51 yards in the Bucs’ season-opening win over the Falcons — he’s thinking about more than just a deep playoff run. He’s thinking about Canton, and the Hall of Fame, and what he’ll be remembered for. He knows what it would mean to become the first Buccaneer to go in from the offensive side of the ball.“I plan on having one of my best seasons,” the 32-year-old says. “And if I retire after this year, I don’t think it’ll be a shock to people.”Is that a prediction?“I’m close to the end, that’s all I’ll say,” he says.He’ll be close to where it all started Monday night in Houston, less than an hour from where he grew up, where Mike Evans learned to bury the pain and harness the rage that boiled inside. That’s what lit the fire in a 9-year-old boy and hardened him into the man he became. All these years later, that fire has yet to burn out.(Photo: Julio Aguilar / Getty Images)
