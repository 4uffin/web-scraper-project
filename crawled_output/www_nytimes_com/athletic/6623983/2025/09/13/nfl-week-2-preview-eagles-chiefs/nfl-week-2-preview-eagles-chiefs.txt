Maybe this is the year someone in the AFC West dethrones the Kansas City Chiefs. Maybe the Micah Parsons-less Dallas Cowboys are actually underrated. Maybe Indianapolis is the perfect setting for Daniel Jones’ redemption arc. Maybe the Jaxson Dart era starts much sooner than expected — or needs to.AdvertisementWe’ll see how it all unfolds in due time. For now, The Athletic’s NFL writers Mike Sando, Zak Keefer and Jeff Howe discuss the rest of Week 2’s slate and what piques their interest most.We get a Super Bowl LIX rematch on Sunday between the Eagles and Chiefs. Based on the loss in Brazil, are there any real worries for Kansas City aside from a potential Xavier Worthy injury? Eagles DT Jalen Carter will play after the NFL allowed his Week 1 ejection for spitting on Dak Prescott to serve as a one-game suspension. Did the league get this right?Sando: I’m worried the Chiefs will again have a hard time creating explosive plays, and that in some cases, they might struggle to get “up” for ordinary opponents after so many years of high-level success. What happens against the Eagles will be revealing. If the Chiefs cannot put together a strong performance in a Super Bowl rematch after a disappointing opener in which Andy Reid questioned his team’s fire, then what? On Carter, I think the league missed a chance to make a stronger statement, but this result was not surprising.Keefer: The worry for Kansas City, at least before the season-opening loss to the Chargers, was how a rebooted offensive line would fare against Carter and an Eagles’ front that absolutely wrecked the Super Bowl in February. Early returns were not promising: Start with right tackle Jawaan Taylor, who had two false starts and two holding penalties. Even Travis Kelce was screaming at him.The job gets tougher this week, and I imagine Carter, fresh off missing the Cowboys game, will make his presence felt in what is essentially his season opener. There’s also the defense, which folded late in a way a Steve Spagnuolo unit rarely does. An 0-2 hole is not a death sentence for a team of this caliber, but it would be enough to merit some serious questions about where this season is headed.AdvertisementHowe: The Chiefs’ opener might have been a worst-case scenario, so I’ll try not to overreact. There are absolutely concerns with the offense around Patrick Mahomes, but they countered that last season with excellent defense and situational execution, especially in clutch situations. They whiffed in those areas against the Chargers.Here’s a doomsday way of looking at the offense: Two of their four most productive receivers in the opener were cut in the last 13 months by the Patriots, who haven’t exactly been swimming in wideouts of late. The other two are either showing their age (Travis Kelce) or missed 15 games to injury in 2024 (Hollywood Brown), while Xavier Worthy (shoulder) and Rashee Rice (suspension) have been temporarily tabled. The margin for error has seemingly disappeared.As for Carter, the punishment was fine. I’m sure he’s dealt with his share of internal pressure, too, so we’ll see how he responds from a week of important reflection.A trio of QBs shut down offseason narratives — at least for the moment — in Week 1. The Steelers’ Aaron Rodgers (too old) faces the Seahawks. The Colts’ Daniel Jones (he’s Daniel Jones) faces the Broncos. The Chargers’ Justin Herbert (can’t win big games) meets the Raiders on Monday night. Which QB do we believe will change his narrative the most this season?Sando: It could be Daniel Jones simply because Rodgers is ancient and Herbert cannot really change his narrative until the playoffs, where it’s unlikely Herbert would lead the Chargers past the heavyweights in the conference. Fifty coaches and execs had Jones in Tier 4 entering this season. He has a great opportunity to reestablish himself as a Tier 3 player — good enough to start.

NFL QB Tiers 2025: Lamar Jackson surges into Tier 1, Jayden Daniels sets rookie record
See who joined Jackson in Tier 1, where Caleb Williams stacks up in the 2024 draft class, how far Aaron Rodgers fell and much, much more.
Keefer: I’m tempted to go with Daniel Jones because Shane Steichen has been a very successful play caller when he’s had the right quarterback — he helped Jalen Hurts ascend in Philadelphia, then was one throw away from a division title his first year in Indianapolis with Gardner Minshew under center for most of the season.AdvertisementI do think Jones changes the perception of him this season because, in a lot of ways, he fits well: The Colts’ offense is deep, and he doesn’t need to carry it. Plus, Jones is far more accurate over the middle of the field than Anthony Richardson, and that’s where the Colts’ new weapon, rookie tight end Tyler Warren, does most of his work. I also think by season’s end, Herbert is talked about differently — the Chargers are winning some playoff game(s) this winter.Howe: Herbert’s most consistent hurdle has been his health. He’s played through a pile of injuries and at times still helped the Chargers exceed expectations. If he avoids those bigger injuries this season, his stock could explode. The Chargers showed a ton of faith in Herbert in the fourth quarter, calling 11 passing plays over their final 15 snaps before kneeling out the clock, which was a startling ratio given Jim Harbaugh’s penchant to run-run-run out the clock at all hours of the day. That says everything you need to know about their belief in Herbert. They also have the pieces to help Herbert when the games get even bigger down the stretch.The Giants are on the road to face the Cowboys. Is it Jaxson Dart time if New York sees another lackluster offensive performance from Russell Wilson? Did anything from the season opener against the Eagles change your view of what Dallas is capable of this season?Sando: I already thought the Cowboys were underrated, so Dallas’ performance was affirming. Dak Prescott returning to health more than offsets Micah Parsons’ departure in terms of affect on the team. That’s simply the value of the QB position. Prescott did look better than expected against the Eagles. I could see Dart getting the call in Week 3 if Wilson turns over the ball and plays poorly in a dispiriting defeat.Keefer: If the Giants are smart — jury’s still out — they won’t rush Dart into the lineup. If I learned anything from months of conversations with quarterbacks, coaches and executives about why and how teams fail young QBs in this league, the leading reason is how quickly teams abandon their plan when things go poorly. The Giants decided Russell Wilson was their starter. They shouldn’t panic after one game simply to appease the fans. The long-term plan for Dart should take precedence, even if that means suffering some tough losses the next few months.Dallas, I thought, was pretty impressive in that opener. It’s easy to overlook how good Prescott and CeeDee Lamb are (Lamb’s drops notwithstanding). I still see the Cowboys having a hard time getting to 10 wins, because the longer they go without Parsons, the more his absence will show up.

— Charlotte Carroll (@charlottecrrll) September 12, 2025Howe: I wouldn’t play Dart until Andrew Thomas is fully healthy. The rookie needs some piece of mind on his blind side while adjusting to the heightened speed of the game. The Patriots were in a similar situation last year with Drake Maye, who didn’t make his starting debut until Week 6 and still had a productive season to use as a foundation.The Giants have laid the groundwork for patience, so it would be a panic move to insert Dart this quickly. The team would feel that in the locker room, which would only add to the degree of difficulty. Now, if it gets to a point where Wilson is holding back the offense while the defense is playing well enough to keep them in games, the Giants will have to do right by the whole team and play the best quarterback.AdvertisementThe Cowboys looked better than I expected, especially after so much offseason drama. It’s not like they’re devoid of talent. They were just ravaged by injuries in 2024, so they should be good enough to compete for a back-end playoff spot if their stars stay healthier.Coming off a big win over the division-rival Falcons, the Buccaneers are on the road to face the Texans on “Monday Night Football.” Did that win, and more importantly Emeka Egbuka’s immediate impact, change your view of Tampa Bay’s ceiling for this season?Sando: Egbuka is delivering as anticipated, but I see the Bucs in a tier by themselves after the top three or four teams in the NFC, without the same upward mobility. They are solid, but their ceiling is probably about what it has been — a division winner that could win a game or two in the playoffs. That changes if the defense makes a big jump.Keefer: I think Tampa’s ceiling is the NFC Championship. This has quietly been one of the more consistent teams in the league the last half-decade: The Bucs won with Tom Brady and won after Brady retired. Egbuka was viewed as a luxury pick by some, but with Mike Evans in Year 13 and Chris Godwin working his way back from injury, it seems GM Jason Licht has done it again. The defense will have to improve throughout the season — which it usually does under Todd Bowles — and with the division’s best quarterback, the Bucs should, again, be playing well into January.Howe: No, I expected the Bucs to win that game, and I had no reason to believe they’d break their streak of NFC South titles. Beyond that, I actually think the NFC is wide open this season. The Eagles and Packers probably have the highest ceilings, but there’s a long way between now and January to know whether those expectations will be met. And the Commanders, Rams, Seahawks, Vikings and Lions are there with the Bucs among the teams that could all be there at the end. We’ll see who stays healthy enough to get hot when it matters.The two most thrilling Week 1 wins arguably belong to the Bills, who play at the Jets on Sunday; and the Vikings, who host the Falcons on Sunday night. What did we learn about the Bills and Vikings from those victories?Sando: Minnesota’s comeback victory seemed huge for J.J. McCarthy’s early confidence, and the team’s confidence in him. It alleviated some pressure and helped reset the narrative in a positive way. I think that’s big for McCarthy and the Vikings as they find their way with a new QB. The Bills showed they still have the edge on the Ravens. They also took a huge step toward the No. 1 seed in the AFC, which seems like a ridiculous thing to say after Week 1, except that the Bills have such an easy schedule.Keefer: For starters, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a mid-game swing from a quarterback like McCarthy’s on Monday night. He looked overwhelmed early in Chicago — lost, even — and the Vikings offense was going nowhere. Then, something changed. The run game got going. He hit a couple easy throws. A fire was lit. McCarthy became a different player, and the Vikings owned the fourth quarter while the Bears melted down. Some hard moments are still coming — you can’t play the Bears every week — but McCarthy proved his mettle Monday night, and that goes a long way for a young quarterback in a veteran locker room.As for the Bills, we didn’t learn all that much. We already knew to never rule Josh Allen out. (Same goes for Mahomes, Joe Burrow and the quarterback on the wrong side of Allen’s heroics, Lamar Jackson). Frankly, it’s Buffalo’s defense that has me worried. Giving up 40 points at home — and looking totally lost for stretches against Jackson and Derrick Henry — was concerning.Howe: I picked the Bills to win the Super Bowl, so I already really liked their potential and that opening victory was special — certainly a victory that will be remembered for a long, long time if the Bills do finish the job in five months. We know Allen can put the Bills on his back, and I truly believed they still had a chance even when things looked dire in the closing minutes. That confidence was simply because of his ability to score fast and force the opponent to worry how quickly things can go off the rails when he’s on the opposing sideline. However, there’s a reason the Bills are still coming up short in the Allen era. No quarterback can ever be asked to do it all himself in the playoffs, and this was the type of defensive showing that should absolutely scare the Bills until they prove they can be better.AdvertisementAs for the Vikings, I couldn’t believe how quickly they went from dormant to dominant. McCarthy did a really impressive job of counterattacking Dennis Allen’s defense, which played very well. And the Vikings showed how much they believe in McCarthy by rallying around him late. Defensively, the Vikings have more than enough to keep them in the playoff hunt even with uneven offensive performances. But I’ll want to see more than one great quarter from McCarthy before making any grand proclamations about the Vikings’ chances of being similarly dangerous to the 2024 team.(Top photos of Daniel Jones and Jalen Hurts: Kathryn Riley and Andy Lyons/Getty Images)
