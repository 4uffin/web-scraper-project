Before the two were a couple, Andrews encouraged Swift to go on a date with Kelce while speaking on her podcast.
Kelce later thanked Andrews on Instagram for her podcast assist after he and Swift became an item.In the Fox Sports interview, Kelce spoke about his last two years with Swift.“She has brought excitement and a joy for life that has made me a better man, made me a better person,” Kelce told Andrews. “And made me just that much more comfortable with who I am.”Andrews also asked Kelce about this week’s critical game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Chiefs are 0-1 after a season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo, Brazil.Kansas City hasn’t started 0-2 since the 2014 season.“I think the leaders on this team need to step up, and I’ll be the first one to raise my hand and say that I’m the guy that needs to be that for us,” Kelce said. “A lot of tough love, as you guys saw it (on the field with some emotional outbursts). Everybody just has to look in the mirror. And right now, we’re in a good place to attack a good football team coming into Arrowhead.”(Photo: Bruce Bennett / Getty Images)
