A 20-10 win by No. 3 LSU over Florida was equal parts auspicious and concerning, underlining that the program got some offseason questions right — while asking others that maybe nobody saw coming.AdvertisementThe Tigers weathered multiple personnel losses on defense but relied on homegrown talent and much improved depth on that side of the ball to hold off the Gators. It was needed, too, given another week of hit-or-miss production on offense. Hard to imagine that it’s a paralyzing worry with Heisman Trophy favorite Garrett Nussmeier running the show. But it doesn’t look satisfactory, either.Not that Brian Kelly was willing to countenance the subject when it came up early in his postgame news conference.“What do you want me to tell you? I just laid it out for you — we played the game to win the game,” the LSU coach said. “We played the game to win the game. … You’re looking at this from the wrong perspective. LSU won the football game. Won the game. I don’t know what you want from me. What do you want, for us to win 70-0 against Florida to keep you happy?“That football team just worked their tail off to get an SEC win and you want to know what’s wrong. You know what? You’re spoiled. You’re spoiled. This team is 17-1 at night. Seventeen and one. Give them some respect. How about that? Give them some respect instead of microanalyzing every little thing. This is ridiculous. For a group of seasoned reporters, that kind of question is so out of line.”As for where Florida and Billy Napier are now? Does en route to nowhere good count?
What You Should Read Next
For Florida’s Billy Napier, the numbers are grisly after another troubling loss to a rival
The problem is the offense. Napier’s offense. The offense he leads after refusing to hire a play caller this offseason.
Some quick thoughts from the showdown in Death Valley:DJ Lagway is in a sophomore slumpFlorida was 6-1 during Lagway’s seven starts as a freshman last season, including the four-game winning streak that ended the year and gave Florida a boost of momentum heading into this season. The five-star recruit didn’t dominate every game, but he led a big-play passing attack that helped save Napier’s job.The vibes are shifting. After last week’s 18-16 loss to USF, Lagway threw five interceptions, including a pick late in the first half that let LSU steal a field goal and a pick six midway through the third quarter. It wasn’t all bad, as he also had a second-quarter touchdown pass to Aidan Mizell, but two interceptions on the Gators’ final two drives in the fourth quarter erased any hope of a comeback

— LSU Football (@LSUfootball) September 14, 2025It’s clear Lagway and the Gators don’t look quite the same as the team that rallied in the second half of 2024, including a 27-16 win over LSU. After averaging 10 yards per attempt last year (No. 2 nationally), Lagway was 80th entering Saturday (6.7) and even worse against LSU (5.9) Lagway ultimately completed 33 of 49 passes for 287 yards with the touchdown and five interceptions.AdvertisementLagway missed most of offseason workouts with separate shoulder and leg injuries. Napier suggested afterward that those remain contributing factors but not excuses for his performance.“I do think it’s important for everyone to understand that he’s still a young player…” Napier said. “Tonight is not indicative of who he is as a teammate, a football player and a leader on our team.” — Matt BakerLSU’s defensive depth shinesHere is a bad way to start a rivalry game of consequence: A punt and an ejection of a defensive captain within the first six snaps.So it went for LSU. While an opening three-and-out was not ideal, the much graver sin was a targeting flag on preseason All-America linebacker Whit Weeks on Florida’s third offensive play. The crown of Weeks’ helmet did appear to connect with the face mask of the Gators’ Vernell Brown III, and the obligatory review confirmed the heave-ho for a linchpin in the Tigers’ defense.But this is a different LSU defense, as intended after an offseason spent, well, spending on transfer portal help. So it was at least a little ironic that the homegrown talent helped cauterize the wound Saturday night. Sophomore Dashawn Spears — Denham Springs, La., native and one of the top safety recruits in the Class of 2024 — recorded two interceptions, returning the second 58 yards for a third-quarter touchdown that broke the game open. Freshman DJ Pickett effectively ended the game by picking off Lagway with 2:07 remaining. The leading tackler on the night? Sophomore linebacker Davhon Keys, who grew into a starting role late in his true freshman season and bolstered the position Saturday with 14 stops.

— ESPN (@espn) September 14, 2025Transfers indeed helped; portal products AJ Haulcy and Tamarcus Cooley also recorded picks. But when Brian Kelly talks about better “competitive depth” across the unit — and, really, the entire roster — the ability to weather hits like this is what he means.Advertisement“If you don’t have depth, it’s hard to have a championship team,” defensive end Jack Pyburn said. “We have depth.”The pressing question moving ahead, actually, is about the other Weeks brother in the middle of LSU’s defense. West Weeks, the oldest of three siblings on the roster, headed into the injury tent midway through the third quarter and emerged with a towel over his head and his father, David, at his side. After the game, Kelly said it was a calf injury for West Weeks — enough to keep him out of the remainder of the game but not likely a long-term issue. “We don’t think it’s a serious injury,” Kelly said. — Brian HamiltonSo … about LSU’s offenseThe numbers entering Saturday were middling. A total offense ranking of 84th nationally. Outside the top 100 in yards per play.Then against Florida, LSU had flashes offensively and little more.Nussmeier looked like he snapped out of a funk by completing 6 of 7 passes for 75 yards on a second-quarter touchdown drive, but he finished a relatively ho-hum 15-of-27 for 220 yards overall. He followed another light bulb moment in the fourth quarter — a 65-yard catch-and-run connection with Bauer Sharp — by throwing an interception that breathed life into Florida when LSU had the chance to snuff all of it out.Final numbers? A decent 316 total yards and 6.1 yards per play – both figures goosed by a 51-yard run by Caden Durham with the game already in hand. This is not what one imagines when there’s a Heisman frontrunner under center. And growing pains are just pains if they last too long.“We’re not perfect,” Kelly said. “But we’re going to make progress every single day. And we’re going to play to a great defense that we have right now, and we’re going to keep working to get better on offense.” — Hamilton
The pressure’s mounting for NapierThe loss dropped Napier’s record to 20-21, three games into his fourth year at Florida. In the last 65 years, only one other Gators coach has had a losing record at this point in his tenure: Charley Pell, who started 19-21-1 from 1979-82. And with a trip to No. 5 Miami looming next week, the road isn’t getting any easier: No. 6 Georgia, No. 7 Texas, No. 10 Florida State, No. 15 Tennessee, No. 16 Texas A&M and No. 17 Ole Miss are on the schedule too.AdvertisementAthletic director Scott Stricklin has been relatively patient with previous coaching decisions. He did not fire Napier’s predecessor, Dan Mullen, until after the SEC finale in 2021, even though the Gators’ shortcomings were obvious weeks earlier. Stricklin also retained Napier after last season’s 1-2 start. Even if a move does not appear imminent, Napier’s situation continues to look bleak.Napier’s buyout is 85 percent of what’s left on his contract. At the end of this contract year, that’s about $19.4 million. — BakerFlorida-LSU remains a weird, fierce rivalryWell before anything official happened at Tiger Stadium on Saturday night, it was necessary to issue a clarification about some unofficial pregame, uh, activities.Maybe not only Florida-LSU. But definitely very Florida-LSU.“There was some get together around the LSU student section between the teams,” went the pregame announcement in the press box. ”There was no penalty called. There (are) no infractions against either team. There was a flag but that was just to get the teams separated to move everything along.”
Shockingly, there were some pregame shenanigans with Florida-LSU pic.twitter.com/22yS6A8EwM
— Matt Baker (@MattBakerCFB) September 13, 2025The get-together was the second pregame shouting match between the teams. There was another one in the second quarter, plus some characteristic weirdness (LSU’s Tamarcus Cooley earning an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for kicking the ball after allowing a touchdown). — Hamilton(Photo of Dashawn Spears: Chris Graythen / Getty Images)
