Vuelta a Espana finish cancelled on security grounds after pro-Palestine protests in Madrid - The AthleticCyclingVuelta a Espana finish cancelled on security grounds after pro-Palestine protests in MadridBy Ali Rampling and Guillermo RaiSept. 14, 2025Share167The finish to the final stage of the 2025 Vuelta a Espana was cancelled on Sunday following pro-Palestine protests in Madrid.It marked the third time during the 2025 tour that a stage had been cut short due to demonstrations against the presence of the Israel-Premier Tech team.Danish cyclist Jonas Vingegaard, who had led heading into the 21st and final stage, was declared the winner.AdvertisementAround 58 kilometres of the race was remaining when the peloton entered the centre of the Spanish capital and protestors walked into the middle of the road carrying flags and banners. A number of riders slowed and were caught up in the protests.A significant number of protestors were also gathered around 200 metres from the finish line, situated behind the race barriers and police, while others occupied separate parts of the course.The race was briefly halted as police officers spoke to organisers. Following a period of discussions, the riders shook hands and it was confirmed there would be no podium ceremony.A Vuelta statement read: “For security reasons, stage 21 of La Vuelta has been ended early. There will be no podium ceremony.”

Organisers have added more security personnel in wake of the protests, the scale of which has taken them by surprise.Stage 16 of the Vuelta was cut short by protests in Galacia on Tuesday, and this followed large-scale protests in Bilbao on stage 12 that led to the cancellation of the stage finish.The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) had said it “firmly condemns the actions that led to the neutralisation” of stage 12.“The UCI reiterates the fundamental importance of the political neutrality of sports organisations within the Olympic Movement, as well as the unifying and pacifying role of sport,” the statement read.Champion Vingegaard, 28, had expressed his sympathy for the protestors earlier in the tour.“People are protesting for a reason,” he told Danish channel TV2. “What’s happening right now (in Gaza) is horrific. The protesters want their voices to be heard, and I believe the media should give them that space in some way.Advertisement“It’s unfortunate that the protests are taking place during the race, and nearly all riders agree on that, but these people are desperate to find a way to be heard.”The 2026 Tour de France is due to start in Spain with two stages in Barcelona.‘A climate of enormous tension’By The Athletic’s Guillermo Rai, on the ground in MadridThe centre of Madrid was at a standstill for a few hours on Sunday. Ultimately, nothing went as planned for the Vuelta organisers, who did not want to change the route of the last stage even though there were safer alternative proposals.The result was a climate of enormous tension in the streets, with hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian flags and many anti-Israeli messages.The authorities initially expected around 6,000 demonstrators, but the feeling from the ground is that the turnout has been much larger.The protests have escalated to such an extent that there has been a heavy police presence and scenes rarely seen in recent months in the Spanish capital.
(Guillermo Rai, The Athletic)For these reasons, the organisers decided not to hold the usual celebration and medal ceremony in the Plaza de Cibeles. Hundreds of demonstrators were still gathered there at 8:30pm local time, hours after the conclusion of the race.At that moment, the Israel-Premier Tech team bus had already left for security reasons.Even an unprecedented security deployment could not prevent the inevitable. According to sources in the Government Delegation, there has been a deployment of 1,100 national police and 400 Civil Guards in addition to the security contingent that was already travelling. These are numbers not seen since the NATO meeting in Madrid in 2022.(Photo: Philippe Marcou/AFP via Getty Images)
