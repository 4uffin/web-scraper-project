Every week, Jeff Howe notes who’s rising and falling at starting quarterback (and why) for all 32 teams.Justin Herbert caused an international incident.The Los Angeles Chargers quarterback outdueled Patrick Mahomes and the three-time reigning AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs on Friday night in Brazil, delivering a signature performance with clutch plays and some memorable moments. Herbert’s ability to produce on such a grand stage could have been an important catapult into a highly anticipated second season with coach Jim Harbaugh.AdvertisementBut maybe it wasn’t all that different.“(Herbert) is one of the top players in the entire league,” said a coach, who was granted anonymity so he could speak openly. “He’s beaten Mahomes before, and he will again. The key will be how (Herbert) performs at the end of the season, so he can write his story the right way.”Herbert finished Friday 25-of-34 for 318 yards and three touchdowns in a turnover-free night, as the Chargers staved off a Chiefs rally to preserve a 27-21 victory. Most noteworthy, a typically run-happy Harbaugh leaned heavily on Herbert as the Chargers closed out the game in the fourth quarter.The Chargers had the ball twice in the final frame with a one-possession lead. Ahead 20-18, Herbert dropped back on eight of 11 plays before delivering a 23-yard touchdown pass to wideout Quentin Johnston with 4:57 remaining. Herbert completed all eight passes for 73 yards. Then, up 27-21 with 2:34 to go, Herbert dropped back on three of four plays, using a 19-yard scramble on third-and-14 to cue up the victory formation.

— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) September 6, 2025Rather than leaning on first-round running back Omarion Hampton, the Chargers — who ranked 28th in passing attempts and 11th in rushing attempts in 2024 — called passing plays on 11 of 15 snaps to ice the game. It was a clear sign Harbaugh has gained more trust in his franchise quarterback.But this wasn’t a one-off performance, as Herbert improved to 3-7 against the Chiefs. In the seven losses, Herbert gave the Chargers the lead four times in the final five minutes of regulation before the defense gave it away, and there were two other games when the teams were tied in the fourth quarter. He’s done his part more often than not.Herbert has also delivered the Chargers to winning records in three of his five seasons as the starter. He threw for 5,014 yards and a franchise-record 38 touchdowns in 2021. He amassed 4,739 yards and 25 touchdowns in 2022, as Herbert played through broken ribs for 17 games, leading the injury-depleted Chargers to the playoffs because of his high-end production. He underwent surgery after the season on a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Herbert battled several more challenging injuries in 2023 and 2024.Advertisement“He’s as tough as they come,” a coach said.Of course, Herbert needs to shed the injury history to consistently maintain the potential that he again flashed in Brazil. That’s been the primary factor that has kept him from reaching the elite tier of QB play.The postseason success would need to follow from there. The Chargers, who have 12 playoff wins in franchise history, are 0-2 in Herbert’s starts. He’s going to have to elevate them on that stage to be viewed through the same lens as Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow.Herbert got off to the right type of start Friday against a division foe that has tortured the Chargers for years. And with a relatively manageable schedule ahead, there’s enough runway for Herbert’s season to really take off.
On the moneyThere’s increasing pressure on highly paid quarterbacks to perform, particularly among the group who got their deals before sustaining any postseason success. Herbert could be viewed under that umbrella, of course, but even his harshest critics around the league have conceded his physical skills and potential were largely enough to warrant the payday.Let’s narrow the focus to Tua Tagovailoa, Trevor Lawrence and Jordan Love. The three first-round picks have two postseason victories between them.

Why explosion of NFL QB contracts has drastically altered how teams build rosters
QB contracts are taking up a bigger piece of the salary cap pie than ever before. How are teams dealing with this new reality?
Love got off to a scorching start during the Green Bay Packers’ dominant 27-13 victory against the Detroit Lions. He was also ranked in the top seven in 2024 from Week 7 through the end of the season, so Love has gotten very close to top-tier status.Lawrence and Tagovailoa have the most pressure to perform. Lawrence played decently well in the Jacksonville Jaguars’ 26-10 demolition of the Carolina Panthers. He missed some throws, but they’re still working to get in sync with coach Liam Coen’s system and an overhauled group of skill players. Lawrence needs to have a good season before his seat begins to heat up, though his guaranteed money extends through 2027.AdvertisementTagovailoa, on the other hand, was ineffective in the Miami Dolphins’ 33-8 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. And that’s putting it kindly. The Colts muddied the middle of the field, jammed up Tagovailoa’s first reads and held the lefty to 14-of-23 for 114 yards, one garbage-time touchdown and two interceptions. Star receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle combined for eight catches and 70 yards, a pedestrian output for players with such dynamic ability.Tagovailoa is due $54 million in guarantees in 2026, so he’s got job security for another year. But if the Dolphins don’t prove the season opener was a fluke — and fast — it would be prudent to consider other options in the draft.And since The Athletic’s recent study of QB contracts — along with the lack of correlation to wins and losses — it’s fair to wonder how front offices will operate when they’re seeing diminished returns on investment.Don’t overlook Jared Goff, either. The Lions were barely competitive for the first time since 2023, and Goff was efficient if unspectacular in his first game in Detroit without ex-offensive coordinator Ben Johnson.Rival coaches and executives were down on the Lions this season because of the turnover on the coaching staff, but they largely believed Goff would be OK. Goff dropped a league-worst five spots in the QB rankings this week, so his performance will be on the short list of storylines to monitor in the near future.Speaking of which, C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans couldn’t muster anything in a 14-9 defeat to the Los Angeles Rams. Stroud was given a pass by league executives last season because of the beating he took behind a bad offensive line, but people will stop making excuses for him if there isn’t improvement.Considering it’s felt like a formality Stroud would join the ranks of $50 million quarterbacks in the offseason, it’s fair to wonder how the Texans will approach those negotiations. While it wouldn’t be popular to stretch the evaluation period before paying Stroud, it might be the responsible way to handle business, given the knowledge we’ve gained by studying these deals.AdvertisementStroud won’t have anything to worry about, though, if he reignites his 2023 magic.He’s No. 1Tennessee Titans QB Cam Ward held his own during a 20-12 loss in Denver, considering the difficulty of the road environment and the Broncos’ tenacious defensive scheme. In fact, Ward probably deserved better if his receivers had come down with some of his earlier throws.The numbers were forgettable. Ward finished 12-of-28 for 112 yards, but no one with realistic expectations could have believed the No. 1 pick could have taken a rebuilding roster into Denver and lit up the scoreboard against one of the league’s best defensive coordinators in Vance Joseph.Still, we can't excuse Ward’s entire performance. He took two bad sacks in Denver territory after the Broncos muffed a punt, giving away an opportunity to take a fourth-quarter lead by dropping out of field-goal territory. That’s a situation where a more experienced quarterback would have been more aware of his hot reads while understanding a veteran coordinator like Joseph would be dialing up pressure. But hey, rookie quarterbacks are going to look like rookie quarterbacks.Ward also had two bad incompletions on the next drive, missing open receivers in the left seam before punting away with 4:16 remaining. He looked sped up, almost certainly due to the pressure, and couldn’t hit his targets. Six sacks will do that to a quarterback.Ward competed. It wasn’t great, but there was enough to like in his debut against a really tough opponent.

The duel between two of the league's best quarterbacks topped off a dramatic Week 1 that featured 11 games decided by one score or less.
Holster the DartIt was predictable, even expected, for the New York Giants to stick with Russell Wilson.The 36-year-old delivered a dud in his debut, going 17-of-37 for 168 yards in a 21-6 loss to the Washington Commanders, and the murmurs for rookie Jaxson Dart grew understandably louder.But Wilson was sacked twice and hit eight times, and All-Pro left tackle Andrew Thomas was inactive with a foot injury. The Giants are trying to get to a point where they can set up Dart for success, and an afternoon beating at the hands of the conference finalists probably doesn’t jibe with that plan. Ditto for this week against the Dallas Cowboys.AdvertisementIt’s perfectly logical to want to see Dart. He looked the part throughout the summer and symbolizes a level of hope that Giants fans have yearned for years. His time is coming.It’s just going to require patience. The Giants planned all offseason to start Wilson for as long as possible. Obviously, they planned all offseason to score more than six points against the Commanders, too, so it’s important to maintain perspective.Giants leadership couldn’t scrap the QB plan after one game, though. If the Giants aren’t competitive with Wilson again, it could be time to make adjustments. It’s just a little early for that at this very moment.QB stock report is part of a partnership with NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube TV.The Athletic maintains full editorial independence.
