He did it again Saturday for the fifth time in five tries. But this one required a completely different approach, answering those who have questioned his starting quarterback in the process, raising questions about this Georgia defense but leaving no doubt about its heart.AdvertisementNo. 6 Georgia prevailed 44-41 over No. 15 Tennessee in an overtime classic at a raucous Neyland Stadium, getting the ball second in OT and getting the winning points on a Josh McCray 1-yard touchdown run. McCray was initially ruled short, but a replay review quickly called it a touchdown. A stadium poised to explode in euphoria as it did three years earlier in an enormous win over Alabama instead emptied out quietly as the Bulldogs celebrated on the field.

— ESPN College Football (@ESPNCFB) September 13, 2025The Bulldogs trailed the Vols 21-7 early and 38-30 as the clock melted away in the fourth quarter. But QB Gunner Stockton delivered his most gorgeous pass when it mattered most, a 28-yard loft to London Humphreys in the end zone with 2:32 left. Then he hit Zachariah Branch to tie it.Then Stockton watched Tennessee kicker Max Gilbert miss a 43-yard, game-winning field goal. Which allowed him — after Gilbert hit from 41 in the Vols’ possession of overtime — to get back on the field and win it. He finished 23-for-31 for 304 yards and two touchdowns.That’s nine straight for Smart overall against Tennessee, dating back to 2016, when his first Georgia team lost on the final play, a Hail Mary from Joshua Dobbs to Jauan Jennings. Smart’s team has defensive tinkering to do for sure, but this should be a valuable win on the resume, in part because Tennessee also seems to have a legitimate quarterback in Joey Aguilar (371 yards, four touchdowns, two interceptions).Stockton proves his mettleStockton came into his first road game as a primary storyline: Could Georgia win with him at quarterback?Stockton did enough for the Bulldogs to win a shootout.He was effective both throwing and running, passing for 304 and rushing for 38. He even showed the downfield throwing ability that was the question coming in, hitting on a 45-yarder to Colbie Young on Georgia’s first play, and putting a perfect ball into Humphreys’ hands for the late, game-tying touchdown.AdvertisementHe wasn’t perfect: In the fourth quarter, he made a similar mistake to last season’s College Football Playoff game against Notre Dame, holding onto the ball too long and fumbling on a blind-side sack. But he and Georgia’s skill-position players all played pretty well. Ten different players caught passes.The game revealed more paramount issues for Georgia, though, despite the win.The offensive line broke down as the second half went along, reigniting concerns about that unit. The pass blocking was a problem almost the entire game, while the run blocking didn’t get a consistent push.And of course, there was the defense, starting badly and giving up the lead twice in the fourth quarter.“I feel almost like you have to apologize, because I don’t think that we should have won that game,” Smart said.The main takeaway: Georgia has a lot of work to do, but if Stockton keeps playing the way he did Saturday, quarterback won’t be a concern.Aguilar is a revelation — and a ceiling changerHe was on his way to the best quarterback game … ever? Then he and the Tennessee offense disappeared for a long stretch Saturday, bringing recent Vols failures against Georgia to mind. But Aguilar — the former zero-star recruit and community college quarterback, the seventh-year senior, the last-second replacement for departed starter Nico Iamaleava — resumed a magical day with one perfect 53-yard bomb for a touchdown to Chris Brazzell.Aguilar started 14-for-14 with three touchdowns and looked unstoppable. Then stops came in droves. But in the end, Aguilar got it rolling again and was every bit as clutch as Hendon Hooker was three years earlier in a familiar-feeling win over Alabama. The only problem: His kicker didn’t make the field goal to beat Georgia, as Chase McGrath did three years ago to beat Alabama. Still, the Vols have a veteran with the experience and skill set to run this offense as Heupel wants it run. Oh, and he has some weapons — starting with Brazzell (six catches, 177 yards, three touchdowns).

How did the Heupel-Smart matchup play out?It was by far the best performance for Heupel’s Tennessee offense against Smart’s Georgia defense.Fast starts were one thing: Tennessee had scored on its first possession each of the previous four matchups, including three touchdowns. Keeping it up was the difference this time, hitting on touchdowns the first three possessions and racing out to a 21-7 lead. And even after the Vols were shut down in the middle of the game, with three punts and two interceptions on five consecutive drives, the Vols recovered late, scoring on three consecutive drives late in the third and in the fourth quarter.AdvertisementTennessee had 356 yards through three quarters and 496 for the game. The most Heupel’s Vols had in the previous four meetings against Smart was 387, and that was in the first matchup (2021), when a lot of the yardage was playing catch-up in a 41-17 Georgia win. This time, Tennessee kept pace the whole game.The deep balls were game-changers, admittedly helped by poor play by Georgia’s cornerbacks. Daniel Harris and Ellis Robinson lost one-on-one matchups, and there was a defensive breakdown that led to the 32-yard touchdown to Braylon Staley that put Tennessee up 35-30 in the fourth quarter. Aguilar was also pinpoint accurate to start the game, hitting passes to the middle, something previous Tennessee quarterbacks had not done well against Georgia.Where Georgia improved in the second quarter was by getting a better pass rush, and the linebackers playing the passes to the middle more effectively. Tennessee also couldn’t run the ball consistently, which was a problem in previous matchups. So ultimately it came down to passing, and when Aguilar could hit on those deep balls, Tennessee finally had the Georgia defense figured out. When he didn’t have time to pass, Tennessee didn’t.(Photo: Andy Lyons / Getty Images)
