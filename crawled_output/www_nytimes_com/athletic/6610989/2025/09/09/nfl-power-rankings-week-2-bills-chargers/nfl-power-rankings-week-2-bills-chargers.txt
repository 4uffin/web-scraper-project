Every​ week, Chad Graff and Josh Kendall rank and analyze all 32 teams from first to worst.No one can argue that Week 1 of the NFL season didn’t deliver. Micah Parsons and the Green Bay Packers lived up to the hype, the Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens delivered an instant classic and the Los Angeles Chargers delivered a statement win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Brazil.AdvertisementNow that we have our first impressions of all 32 teams, here’s where things stand in our power rankings.1. Philadelphia Eagles (1-0)Last week: 1Thursday: Beat Cowboys 24-20First impression: Wait until they get rollingThe defending champs won in relatively stress-free fashion, even with Saquon Barkley getting bottled up for 3.3 yards per carry, while committing five more penalties than the Cowboys, without getting their top receiver involved, without arguably their top defensive player (who was thrown out of the game before the first snap) and without notching a sack. A win with their “C” game is a good sign for what’s to come.Up next: at Chiefs, Sunday, 4:25 ET2. Green Bay Packers (1-0)Last week: 3Sunday: Beat Lions 27-13First impression: The defense is impressiveParsons had barely been with the Packers a week and already made a massive impact as the defense flummoxed the Lions. Once Parsons is comfortable, look out. As Rashan Gary told our Mike Silver, “Once he and I figure some stuff out about how each of us likes to rush, watch out. It’s gonna get spooky for sure.”Up next: vs. Commanders, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET

The buzz at Lambeau Field felt surreal during and after Green Bay's startling win, a result infused with the aura of Micah Parsons.
3. Buffalo Bills (1-0)Last week: 4Sunday: Beat Ravens 41-40First impression: Never count out Josh AllenFollowing his Bills debut, former Charger Joey Bosa sounded like he was in shock after watching Allen, the reigning MVP, go 33-of-46 passing for 394 yards with four total touchdowns in engineering an incredible comeback win. “It’s a lesson for me to know it’s never over until it’s over,” Bosa told our Tim Graham.Up next: at Jets, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET4. Los Angeles Chargers (1-0)Last week: 12Friday: Beat Chiefs 27-21First impression: Has Justin Herbert put it all together?The sixth-year QB was a stud against the Chiefs, completing 25 of 34 passes for 318 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions (not to mention 32 rushing yards). Perhaps Year 2 with Jim Harbaugh is when Herbert elevates into Tier 1 status.Up next: at Raiders, Monday, 10 p.m. ET

5. Washington Commanders (1-0)Last week: 7Sunday: Beat Giants 21-6First impression: Is the defense better, or were they just playing the Giants?AdvertisementThe Commanders knew they needed to get better defensively this offseason. Mission accomplished in Week 1, holding New York to just 3.7 yards per play. But was that legit, or just the benefit of playing Russell Wilson and the Giants’ mediocre offense? We’ll find out more about this team on Thursday.Up next: at Packers, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET6. San Francisco 49ers (1-0)Last week: 15Sunday: Beat Seahawks 17-13First impression: Robert Saleh makes a differenceLast season, the 49ers defense ranked 26th in the NFL in EPA/play and 29th in success rate. This offseason, Saleh returned as defensive coordinator, and the 49ers look dominant again on that side of the ball. They held Seattle to 230 yards of offense and 3-of-10 on third downs.Up next: at Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET7. Los Angeles Rams (1-0)Last week: 11Sunday: Beat Texans 14-9First impression: Nate Landman looks like a stealThe Rams signed Landman, a linebacker, to a veteran minimum contract this summer. Then he played like one of the best linebackers in the NFL on Sunday. The Rams keep finding hidden gems, and Landman may be next as part of a defense that looked legit against C.J. Stroud and the Texans.Up next: at Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET
Derrick Henry looked like the Derrick Henry of old against the Bills, rushing for 169 yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries. (Bryan Bennett/Getty Images)8. Baltimore Ravens (0-1)Last week: 2Sunday: Lost to Bills 41-40First impression: Super Bowl or bust is still onLet’s be honest. Had the final five minutes gone differently Sunday, they’d probably be our No. 1 team. They were so dominant for so long that night that it feels weird to have them this low. The running game is again great (wow, Derrick Henry), and Lamar Jackson looked stellar. But that loss could have some big home-field implications a few months from now.Up next: vs. Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET9. Cincinnati Bengals (1-0)Last week: 9Sunday: Beat Browns 17-16First impression: There’s still some September rustThe Bengals played their starters this preseason in the name of getting off to a better start in the regular season. The good news? For just the second time in seven years, they’re 1-0. The bad news? They were held to 141 yards of total offense, and this game was just as ugly as a lot of their previous Week 1 losses. But, hey, results matter.Up next: vs. Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETAdvertisement10. Kansas City Chiefs (0-1)Last week: 5Friday: Lost to Chargers 27-21First impression: Do they have enough of a pass rush?Their streak of 17 straight wins in one-score games is over, and their margin for error just seems smaller than it used to be. The Chiefs did notch three sacks, but for the most part, they gave Herbert way too much time to throw. They need more from Charles Omenihu, Mike Danna and Derrick Nnadi. And their top pass rusher, Chris Jones, offered an easy escape from the pocket on a crucial, late first-down scramble.Up next: vs. Eagles, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET11. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-0)Last week: 16Sunday: Beat Falcons 23-20First impression: Emeka Egbuka is a studThe rookie wideout’s pair of touchdowns sent quite a message. Baker Mayfield and the Bucs were a bit up and down in this one, but given Egbuka’s play, this offense should be a ton of fun when Chris Godwin gets healthy.Up next: at Texans, Monday, 7 p.m. ET12. Minnesota Vikings (1-0)Last week: 10Monday: Beat Bears 27-24First impression: They’re so well coachedIt was a nightmare start for J.J. McCarthy. He looked overwhelmed, every bit the rookie making his first start on the road on “Monday Night Football.” But Kevin O’Connell kept encouraging his 22-year-old QB and delivered a play-calling clinic to aid McCarthy’s incredible bounce-back performance as the Vikings turned around a 17-6 deficit.Up next: vs. Falcons, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET13. Pittsburgh Steelers (1-0)Last week: 14Sunday: Beat Jets 34-32First impression: Another Aaron Rodgers revenge tour?It sure seems like a slighted A-Rod is the best A-Rod. And, oh, how fun it must have been for him to toss four touchdown passes against the coach and team that no longer wanted him! Can he keep it rolling without the motivation of facing the Jets? We’ll see, but the 41-year-old showed he can still sling it.Up next: vs. Seahawks, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

14. Detroit Lions (0-1)Last week: 6Sunday: Lost to Packers 27-13First impression: Were their former coordinators that important?AdvertisementDan Campbell’s first game since losing Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn to head coaching jobs did not go well. The offense was a mess. They couldn’t run it (2.1 yards per carry) or throw it (5.7 yards per attempt). And the defense didn’t notch a sack or a turnover. It’s not a good sign for the 2024 NFC North champs.Up next: vs. Bears, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET15. Denver Broncos (1-0)Last week: 13Sunday: Beat Titans 20-12First impression: What happened to Bo Nix?This dark-horse Super Bowl contender was all over the place offensively. Kicking off his second season, Nix was 3-of-9 with one touchdown and two interceptions on passes of 10 yards or more downfield. He was 4-of-10 for 13 yards and an interception when pressured. Yes, they won, but after an offseason of hype, it was an unsightly opener for Sean Payton and company.Up next: at Colts, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET

Indianapolis Colts (1-0)Last week: 28Sunday: Beat Dolphins 33-8First impression: Wow! Where did that come from?The Colts offense scored on all seven of its possessions. Previously discarded quarterback Daniel Jones (22-of-29 passing for 272 yards and a touchdown, plus two rushing touchdowns) was great. Nothing to nitpick in this one, except for the obvious question: Was this for real, or are the Dolphins just that bad?Up next: vs. Broncos, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET17. Houston Texans (0-1)Last week: 8Sunday: Lost to Rams 14-9First impression: This offense needs helpThe Texans made one of the surprise moves of the offseason, hiring Nick Caley as offensive coordinator to replace Bobby Slowik. The Caley era didn’t exactly begin with a bang. Houston’s leading receiver, rookie Jayden Higgins, had just 32 receiving yards. The Texans went 2-for-9 on third downs. This defense is great, but the offense? Not a good start.Up next: vs. Buccaneers, Monday, 7 p.m. ETAdvertisement18. Seattle Seahawks (0-1)Last week: 17Sunday: Lost to 49ers 17-13First impression: Still mediocreAs Michael Shawn-Dugar wrote before the season, the Seahawks are trying to get out of NFL purgatory. But one week in, they look again like a middle-of-the-road team. Offensively, they need someone other than Jaxon Smith-Njigba to step up. Thirteen of Sam Darnold’s 23 passes went his way. Darnold himself (16-of-23 for 150 yards and no touchdowns) looked nothing like the quarterback who played so well most of last season.Up next: at Steelers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET19. Jacksonville Jaguars (1-0)Last week: 25Sunday: Beat Panthers 26-10First impression: This Trevor Lawrence wasn’t much differentThe expectation is that Liam Coen unlocks something more from Lawrence, the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft. On Sunday, Lawrence was the NFL’s least-pressured quarterback. He has a No. 1 wide receiver in Brian Thomas. The Jags ran it well, too. But Lawrence was still just 19-of-31 for 178 yards with a touchdown and an interception. That’s not the something more Jags fans were hoping for.Up next: at Bengals, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET20. Las Vegas Raiders (1-0)Last week: 18Sunday: Beat Patriots 20-13First impression: Chip Kelly’s offense is funGeno Smith was slinging it. The Raiders hit nine passes of 20 yards or more en route to Smith’s 362 passing yards against a beleaguered New England secondary. Just wait until Ashton Jeanty and the running game inevitably get rolling. This was a nice restart for Kelly and head coach Pete Carroll.Up next: vs. Chargers, Monday, 10 p.m. ET21. Arizona Cardinals (1-0)Last week: 22Sunday: Beat Saints 20-13First impression: Will Johnson might’ve been a draft stealThere are still plenty of fair questions about the offense after the Cardinals barely got past a bad Saints team, but Johnson, a rookie cornerback, looks like a stud. In his NFL debut, he had three passes defended, an interception that was called back by a penalty and a massive hit in the fourth quarter.Up next: vs. Panthers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ETAdvertisement22. Dallas Cowboys (0-1)Last week: 20Thursday: Lost to Eagles 24-20First impression: Dak Prescott needs more helpThe quarterback’s numbers weren’t great: just 21-of-34 passing for 188 yards. Prescott threw some great balls, but he was let down by his receivers too many times, including his top target, CeeDee Lamb. Prescott did his part against the defending Super Bowl champs — he just needs more help. Including on defense, where the Parsons-less pass rush had only one sack.Up next: vs. Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

Parsons made his Packers' debut Sunday. Could the Cowboys have used him? Of course, but they're focused on their own edge rushers.
23. Atlanta Falcons (0-1)Last week: 24Sunday: Lost to Buccaneers 23-20First impression: The running game is an issueHow is it that a run game with Bijan Robinson, Tyler Allgeier and a decent O-line can look so bad? Their two backs turned 22 carries into 48 yards. Robinson did have 100 yards receiving, and Michael Penix had a big (if slightly inconsistent) day, but they need more production on the ground.Up next: at Vikings, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET24. Chicago Bears (0-1)Last week: 21Monday: Lost to Vikings 27-24First impression: Caleb Williams needs better play in the pocketThe second-year quarterback had a great first half, going 13-of-16 passing for 112 yards. He had some superb moments when he was able to escape the pocket and extend plays. He scrambled for a touchdown. But too often, Williams struggled to play within structure. That has to improve under new coach Ben Johnson.Up next: at Lions, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

New York Jets (0-1)Last week: 26Sunday: Lost to Steelers 34-32First impression: They have an offense!The Jets had their best offensive success rate in 43 games. They outgained the Steelers 394 yards to 271. Justin Fields (16-of-22 passing for 218 yards and a touchdown, plus two rushing scores) had the sixth-best EPA per play of any quarterback in Week 1. It was a tough loss in Glenn’s debut as coach, but these are all steps in the right direction for a team that has been tough to watch in recent years.Up next: vs. Bills, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETAdvertisement26. Cleveland Browns (0-1)Last week: 32Sunday: Lost to Bengals 17-16First impression: They deserved betterThe Browns were better than the Bengals in nearly every area Sunday: first downs, third downs, total yards, yards per play, passing yards, rushing yards and more. And they still lost, thanks largely to a missed PAT and 36-yard field goal from rookie kicker Andre Szmyt.Up next: at Ravens, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET27. Tennessee Titans (0-1)Last week: 31Sunday: Lost to Broncos 20-12First impression: The offense is a messThe Titans offense never got inside the Broncos’ 10-yard line. Cam Ward completed 12 of 28 passes for a mere 112 yards. Their leading receiver was Tony Pollard, who had one catch for 29 yards. Yes, the Denver defense is good. But that was ugly.Up next: vs. Rams, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET28. New England Patriots (0-1)Last week: 23Sunday: Lost to Raiders 20-13First impression: Gee, that looked like last yearFor all of the changes this offseason — particularly at head coach and offensive coordinator — the Patriots’ opener sure looked a lot like the team’s dismal performances of a year ago. The offense really struggled, and second-year quarterback Drake Maye didn’t look ready for a big Year 2 leap.Up next: at Dolphins, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET29. Carolina Panthers (0-1)Last week: 27Sunday: Lost to Jaguars 26-10First impression: Bryce Young’s heater is overAfter ending last season in impressive fashion, Young was back to his old self in the season opener: 18-of-35 passing for 154 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Young’s EPA per play was the second worst of any QB in Week 1, topping only Wilson.Up next: at Cardinals, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET30. New Orleans Saints (0-1)Last week: 29Sunday: Lost to Cardinals 20-13First impression: Kellen Moore sure loves to throw itAdvertisementWe knew the new Saints coach would try to beat teams through the air. But is New Orleans’ plan really going to be to let Spencer Rattler throw it 46 times, like he did on Sunday? That doesn’t seem wise, especially since Alvin Kamara looked reinvigorated.Up next: vs. 49ers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET31. New York Giants (0-1)Last week: 30Sunday: Lost to Commanders 21-6First impression: How much longer until we see Jaxson Dart?The defensive line might keep the Giants watchable, but the early returns on the Wilson era are terrible (17-of-37 for 168 yards). Malik Nabers remains fun to watch, but it’s likely going to be a slog until Dart takes over.Up next: at Cowboys, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

Just a total disaster. If things don’t change quickly, Mike McDaniel could be the first coach to be fired this season.Up next: vs. Patriots, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETNFL Power Rankings is part of a partnership with NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube TV.The Athletic maintains full editorial independence.
