But Wilson threw a costly interception in overtime, which gave Dallas the ball on its own 30. Four plays later, Aubrey booted the game-winner to improve Dallas to 1-1 under first-year coach Brian Schottenheimer.AdvertisementThe final minute of regulation whipsawed back and forth. Dallas took a four-point lead with 52 seconds left when Dak Prescott threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to George Pickens. The Giants came right back, with Wilson connecting with Malik Nabers on a 48-yard touchdown with 25 seconds left. That left Dallas with just enough time, however. The Cowboys got the ball just past midfield and Aubrey made his 64-yarder to send the game to overtime. He also had field goals of 51 and 44 yards.It is just Week 2, but this loss was gutting for the Giants, who fell to 0-2. They were reeling after a listless loss to the Washington Commanders in Week 1. During the week, Nabers had to spend time saying that a fiery sideline interaction he had with coach Brian Daboll during the game was “blown out of proportion.” For a time on Sunday, it looked like a memorable win against an NFC East rival could put all of that in the rearview mirror.
Nine of Wilson’s 30 completions went to Nabers, including his fourth-quarter touchdown and a 29-yard score in the second quarter. He was looking to connect with Nabers for a 10th time when Donovan Wilson made the interception in overtime. For Dallas, Dak Prescott was 38-of-52 passing for 361 yards and two touchdowns.Some perspective from the CowboysCowboys players were clearly thrilled about the win. It was the first under new head coach Brian Schottenheimer. But the opponent has to be considered. It’s very likely that the Giants end up being one of the NFL’s worst teams this year. This was basically a must-win for the Cowboys. If you can’t beat this Giants team, there’s no realistic thought of being a playoff team. Lose to the Giants and say hello to the possibility of a four or five-win season. Maybe Dallas can build off of it. But there’s a lot that needs to be fixed. The defense making Russell Wilson look like prime Tom Brady was a major issue. In the end, it was another Dak Prescott win over the Giants. It’s pretty much an expected outcome at this point. Sunday was the 14th time in a row it has happened. — Jon Machota, Cowboys beat writerAdvertisementPenalty flags fly for the GiantsThe Giants’ sloppy play was one of the major storylines, with the team committing 14 penalties for 160 yards. They surpassed the most penalties committed during the Daboll era (13 vs. Dallas in Week 13 in 2024). According to Pro Football Reference, the Giants also set the franchise record for penalty yards incurred in a single game with 160 yards. The penalty party started early when Daboll was forced to bench left tackle James Hudson after he committed four penalties on the Giants’ first possession. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writerJaxson Dart makes his debutJaxson Dart made his NFL debut, playing three snaps. He came in during the fourth quarter for a handoff to fellow rookie Cam Skattebo, who ran for 24 yards. Skattebo scored a TD on the very next play. Dart came in during the following Giants’ offensive drive for two snaps. He handed the ball off to running back Tyrone Tracey. Dart came in for one final play, keeping the ball himself and losing 3 yards on a rush. When asked about potential packages earlier this week to get him in the game, Dart said, “I’m just preparing for whatever chance that I get. There’s not a specific game plan or anything like that. It’s me just trying to be prepared and be ready whenever my number’s called.” — Carroll(Photo of Brandon Aubrey kicking a field goal in the fourth quarter: Ron Jenkins / Getty Images)
