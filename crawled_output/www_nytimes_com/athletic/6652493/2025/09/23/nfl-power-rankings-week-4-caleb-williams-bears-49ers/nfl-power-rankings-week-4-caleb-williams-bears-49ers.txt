Every​ week, Chad Graff and Josh Kendall rank and analyze all 32 teams from first to worst.It was only Week 3, and already five teams were without their starting quarterback. For three of them, it hardly mattered. Mac Jones and the San Francisco 49ers beat the  Arizona Cardinals, Marcus Mariota and the Washington Commanders beat the Las Vegas Raiders, and Carson Wentz and the Minnesota Vikings beat Jake Browning and the  Cincinnati Bengals.AdvertisementStill, questions remain for those teams and others at the sport’s most important position. So this week, the Power Rankings will be gauging how confident each team should be in its quarterback situation looking ahead to Week 4.1. Philadelphia Eagles (3-0)Last week: 2Sunday: Beat Rams 33-26QB confidence: Cold-blooded confidenceAs 336-pound Jordan Davis rumbled his way into the end zone on the game’s final play and the Eagles sideline bounced with excitement, Jalen Hurts watched without reaction. If you didn’t know any better, you might’ve thought the Eagles just lost in painful fashion. But Hurts is now 17-0 in the last 17 games he started and finished. The guy just wins.Up next: at Buccaneers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET2. Buffalo Bills (3-0)Last week: 3Thursday: Beat Dolphins 31-21QB confidence: Could it be any higher?Josh Allen is the defending MVP. He’s already up to seven touchdowns (five passing, two rushing) and 869 total yards. He’s as good as there is right now. There’s nothing left for him to prove in the regular season.Up next: vs. Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET3. Los Angeles Chargers (3-0)Last week: 4Sunday: Beat Broncos 23-20QB confidence: SkyrocketingIn Year 6, Justin Herbert is living up to the massive expectations that have long surrounded him. He leads the NFL with 860 passing yards to go with six touchdowns and one interception. His strong start has him as the player with the third-best odds to be named MVP, per BetMGM.Up next: at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

It's no surprise the Bills and Eagles are undefeated, but the Chargers and Colts have done their best to steal the spotlight.
4. San Francisco 49ers (3-0)Last week: 9Sunday: Beat Cardinals 16-15QB confidence: Fine if healthyMac Jones re-aggravated a PCL strain Sunday while leading the Niners to a second win with him under center. Meanwhile, starter Brock Purdy has been out with a toe injury. But even while changing quarterbacks and playing without receivers Brandon Aiyuk and Jauan Jennings, the 49ers keep rolling along, taking advantage of an easy early schedule.Up next: vs. Jaguars, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ETAdvertisement5. Detroit Lions (2-1)Last week: 6Monday: Beat Ravens 38-30QB confidence: Ben Johnson, who?After some Week 1 rust, Jared Goff and the Lions offense are back to the aggressiveness and fun play calling that were so successful under Johnson. Goff benefited from a strong running game Monday night but played well, including a perfect pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown late on fourth-and-2. The last two weeks feel like a statement that they’ll be fine after losing their two coordinators from last season.Up next: vs. Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-0)Last week: 8Sunday: Beat Jets 29-27QB confidence: Full of swaggerBaker Mayfield has brought confidence to the Bucs, even if there are signs it may not be sustainable. The Bucs were tied or losing with 90 seconds left in all three games this season. No NFL team has ever started 3-0 with a lower point differential than Tampa Bay’s plus-6. No matter. Mayfield’s confidence is rubbing off on his teammates.Up next: vs. Eagles, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET7. Green Bay Packers (2-1)Last week: 1Sunday: Lost to Browns 13-10QB confidence: Great (when Jim Schwartz isn’t around)A matchup against Schwartz and the Browns defense eventually thwarted Jordan Love’s efficient start. But even while often flummoxed, Love drove the Packers into field goal range Sunday before a block set up Cleveland’s game winner in the biggest upset of Week 3. Still, Love will be fine. Nothing to see here.Up next: at Cowboys, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET8. Indianapolis Colts (3-0)Last week: 10Sunday: Beat Titans 41-20QB confidence: Is Daniel Jones the new Sam Darnold?A year ago, Darnold got his career back on solid footing with an impressive campaign no one saw coming. Maybe it’s Jones’ turn. Everyone waiting for Jones (and the Colts) to implode will have to wait another week. Jones leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt.Up next: at Rams, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET
Matthew Stafford was an efficient 19-for-33 passing on Sunday for 196 yards, a touchdown and an interception and had the Rams in position for a game-winning field goal attempt. (Mitchell Leff / Getty Images)9. Los Angeles Rams (2-1)Last week: 7Sunday: Lost to Eagles 33-26QB confidence: High (if Stafford’s back is OK)After Matthew Stafford missed some of training camp with an aggravated disc in his back, the quarterback hasn’t appeared on the injury report through three weeks and is playing well. If the 37-year-old stays healthy, the Rams will be a tough out in the NFC.Up next: vs. Colts, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ETAdvertisement10. Baltimore Ravens (1-2)Last week: 5Monday: Lost to Lions 38-30QB confidence: High, of course, but is there enough help?Lamar Jackson was predictably very good on Monday night. But the O-line struggled, Derrick Henry lost another key fourth-quarter fumble and the receivers didn’t do much to help. The seven sacks Jackson took tied for the most he’s taken in a game during his eight-year NFL career.Up next: at Chiefs, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET11. Washington Commanders (2-1)Last week: 11Sunday: Beat Raiders 41-24QB confidence: Just let Jayden Daniels get healthyWashington fans don’t need any flashbacks to a quarterback suffering a reinjury after a promising rookie season. While Daniels missed Sunday’s game, Marcus Mariota was surprisingly efficient — though it helps when you also get a 90-yard punt return and a 60-yard rush. Still, Mariota did everything asked of him and should be fine if he’s needed to start again this week against a reeling Atlanta team.Up next: at Falcons, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET12. Kansas City Chiefs (1-2)Last week: 13Sunday: Beat Giants 22-9QB confidence: Just waiting on reinforcementsSomehow, Patrick Mahomes has made Tyquan Thornton look like a legit NFL receiver after he was cast off by the Patriots as a second-round bust. If he can do that with Thornton, this offense should be fine once Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy are back.Up next: vs. Ravens, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET13. Seattle Seahawks (2-1)Last week: 15Sunday: Beat Saints 44-13QB confidence: Cautiously optimisticQuietly, Sam Darnold ranks third in the NFL in yards per pass, sixth in completion percentage and second in success rate. He has the Seahawks offense moving along nicely and seems to be fitting well with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak.Up next: at Cardinals, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ETAdvertisement14. Minnesota Vikings (2-1)Last week: 22Sunday: Beat Bengals 48-10QB confidence: Does it matter?Kevin O’Connell picked up Carson Wentz four weeks ago, and even with limited practice reps and basically no training camp, Wentz guided the Vikings to a blowout win while throwing for two touchdowns and averaging 8.7 yards per pass. At this point, it would be fun to see which quarterback you could drop onto this roster with O’Connell and still win a game.Up next: at Steelers (in Dublin), Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET
In win over Bengals, Vikings QB Carson Wentz threw quick pass (under 2.5 seconds) on 60% of his pass attempts (9 of 12, 101 yards, two TDs); J.J. McCarthy had attempted quick pass on just 17.1% of his dropbacks, per @NextGenStatshttps://t.co/97uckNZgSR pic.twitter.com/EeqIBc7dy5
— Around The NFL (@AroundTheNFL) September 22, 202515. Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1)Last week: 17Sunday: Beat Patriots 21-14QB confidence: It’s a lot to ask … but it’s workingThe Steelers have no running game, and again, they couldn’t get that phase of the offense working even against a struggling Patriots defense. So Aaron Rodgers casually threw a pair of touchdown passes on a day the unit was mostly stagnant.Up next: vs. Vikings (in Dublin), Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET16. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1)Last week: 19Sunday: Beat Texans 17-10QB confidence: Alarm bells are starting to go offThis is Trevor Lawrence’s fifth NFL season, and we keep waiting for a breakout that once felt inevitable. But the switch to Liam Coen as head coach hasn’t come with the positive shift in Lawrence many expected. It’s still early, but this season, Lawrence has completed just 58.8 percent of his passes (30th in the NFL) for 5.9 yards per attempt (25th) and has thrown as many touchdowns (four) as interceptions.Up next: at 49ers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET
Is second-year Broncos quarterback Bo Nix just going through a tough stretch on the heels of his impressive rookie season? Or is this the new norm? (Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Imagn Images)17. Denver Broncos (1-2)Last week: 14Sunday: Lost to Chargers 23-20QB confidence: Is this a slump, or is it just who he is?AdvertisementThe promise of Bo Nix’s rookie season has so far yielded a dud in Year 2. He had a pair of costly overthrows on Sunday and has struggled against pressure. He’s both throwing short (25th in air yards per throw) and for little yardage (26th in yards per attempt). This wasn’t how things were supposed to look in his sophomore season.Up next: vs. Bengals, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET18. Chicago Bears (1-2)Last week: 25Sunday: Beat Cowboys 31-14QB confidence: Dare we say … high?After the struggles of the first two weeks, Caleb Williams thrived Sunday in Ben Johnson’s offense. It was the best game of his short career as he threw for 298 yards and four touchdowns. His deep ball could open things up for this offense, and suddenly there’s some well-deserved confidence in the Williams/Johnson pairing.Up next: at Raiders, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET
Caleb Williams was patient in the pocket Sunday, showcasing the growth that evaluators have noticed under Ben Johnson.

— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) September 22, 202519. Arizona Cardinals (2-1)Last week: 18Sunday: Lost to 49ers 16-15QB confidence: He is what he isAt this point, it’s hard to imagine Arizona will get any more out of Kyler Murray. He’s a fine, middle-of-the-road quarterback who can make dazzling plays with his legs but just isn’t reliable enough to become a top-10 guy. Fittingly, he ranks 15th this season in success rate and 18th in adjusted yards per attempt. Right in the middle of the pack.Up next: vs. Seahawks, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET20. Cleveland Browns (1-2)Last week: 27Sunday: Beat Packers 13-10QB confidence: Can there be any?Joe Flacco was booed at home in the second half en route to a 21-of-36 passing performance for 142 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. The Browns defense helped them secure an impressive win, but if Flacco plays like that much longer, it’ll be time to turn to one of the rookies.Up next: at Lions, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETAdvertisement21. Carolina Panthers (1-2)Last week: 31Sunday: Beat Falcons 30-0QB confidence: Rising concernIf only Bryce Young could always play against the Falcons. He’s 7-24 as an NFL starter but 3-1 against the Falcons. The Panthers nabbed a big win, but Young’s hot streak from the end of last season appears to be over. He ranks 29th (among 31 qualifying quarterbacks) in adjusted yards per attempt.Up next: at Patriots, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

22. Dallas Cowboys (1-2)Last week: 21Sunday: Lost to Bears 31-14QB confidence: At least the “All-22” looks coolNo quarterback has thrown more big-time passes, per PFF, than Dak Prescott (11). But it hasn’t mattered because Prescott also ranks 19th in yards per attempt (6.3). And the task doesn’t get any easier for Dallas this week.Up next: vs. Packers, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET23. Atlanta Falcons (1-2)Last week: 16Sunday: Lost to Panthers 30-0QB confidence: Inexplicably highThe Falcons will tell you they’re super excited about Michael Penix. But so far, there’s been little rationale to back up that belief this season. Penix was pulled for Kirk Cousins late in Sunday’s blowout loss and ranks 35th among 36 quarterbacks in PFF’s passing grade (ahead of only Nix).Up next: vs. Commanders, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET24. Cincinnati Bengals (2-1)Last week: 12Sunday: Lost to Vikings 48-10QB confidence: Totally free-fallingJake Browning threw as many touchdown passes to the Vikings as he did to his teammates in a game that totally got away from Cincy. Another clunker like that, and the Bengals might be better off looking elsewhere (Kirk Cousins?). But would their ownership spend big on a temporary QB?Up next: at Broncos, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET
The Raiders may be 1-2, but quarterback Geno Smith wasn’t the problem in Week 3, as he went 19-for-29 passing for 289 yards and three touchdowns. (Jess Rapfogel / Getty Images)25. Las Vegas Raiders (1-2)Last week: 20Sunday: Lost to Commanders 41-24QB confidence: He’s not why they’re losingGeno Smith has brought what the Raiders were looking for and solidified that position. He ranks seventh in the league in yards per attempt and threw three touchdowns without any interceptions Sunday. But the Raiders haven’t been able to get the running game going with rookie Ashton Jeanty.Up next: vs. Bears, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ETAdvertisement26. New England Patriots (1-2)Last week: 23Sunday: Lost to Steelers 21-14QB confidence: A rare bright spotNot much has gone as planned for the Patriots. The running backs can’t hang on to the ball. The receivers can’t get open. The defense hasn’t been as good as expected. But through three games, Maye has taken a step forward, ranking fifth in the NFL in completion percentage over expected and eighth in expected points added per play.Up next: vs. Panthers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET27. Houston Texans (0-3)Last week: 24Sunday: Lost to Jaguars 17-10QB confidence: Time for the panic buttonC.J. Stroud’s 2024 season was dismissed as a sophomore slump after an incredible rookie season. But now those issues have lingered into Year 3, and it’s time to be worried. Yes, the offensive line stinks. But Stroud has thrown 13 interceptions in his last 17 games and has just one big-time throw this season, per PFF. It’s fair to be concerned.Up next: vs. Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

28. New York Jets (0-3)Last week: 26Sunday: Lost to Buccaneers 29-27QB confidence: Is it mock draft season yet?Justin Fields led the NFL in turnover-worthy throws during his two starts for the Jets. Tyrod Taylor took a different approach in relief of Fields on Sunday, keeping everything short, and ranks 35th among 36 quarterbacks in air yards per throw. New York’s schedule gets a lot easier the next two weeks, but so far, Aaron Glenn needs more from his quarterback.Up next: at Dolphins, Monday, 7:15 p.m. ET29. Tennessee Titans (0-3)Last week: 29Sunday: Lost to Colts 41-20QB confidence: Dropping with each hitCam Ward has been sacked on 13 percent of his dropbacks, the highest rate in the league among quarterbacks with at least 45 dropbacks, and has been sacked a league-high 15 times. His numbers are bad — his 5.1 yards per attempt are only better than Flacco’s — but he hasn’t had much of a chance behind this O-line.Up next: at Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETAdvertisement30. New York Giants (0-3)Last week: 30Sunday: Lost to Chiefs 22-9QB confidence: Crashing … until there’s a changeThe home fans were chanting for rookie Jaxson Dart during “Sunday Night Football.” And yet, shockingly, Russell Wilson’s numbers have not been terrible. The three interceptions don’t help, but Wilson ranks 20th in EPA per play and 12th in yards per attempt. However, that covers up some of the red zone woes where Wilson is 4-of-18 passing with no touchdowns this season. That is why Brian Daboll said Monday the team is “evaluating everything.”Up next: vs. Chargers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET

31. Miami Dolphins (0-3)Last week: 32Thursday: Lost to Bills 31-21QB confidence: Quickly crumblingFor a while, Mike McDaniel seemed like the perfect coach for Tua Tagovailoa. He instilled confidence in the quarterback and leaned into Tagovailoa’s ability to get the ball out quickly. But it has been a disaster this season. Tagovailoa has thrown a turnover-worthy pass on 6.3 percent of his throws, per PFF, easily the highest mark of his career. Oh, and his cap hit next season is $56.4 million.Up next: vs. Jets, Monday, 7:15 p.m. ET32. New Orleans Saints (0-3)Last week: 28Sunday: Lost to Seahawks 44-13QB confidence: Hard to have anySpencer Rattler is 0-9 as a starter in the NFL. After an impressive performance in Week 2, Rattler struggled on Sunday, throwing for just 218 yards on 43 dropbacks with a touchdown and an interception. He has thrown the second-most turnover-worthy passes of any quarterback with three starts, only better so far than Tagovailoa.Up next: at Bills, Sunday, 1 p.m. ETNFL Power Rankings is part of a partnership with NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube TV.The Athletic maintains full editorial independence.
