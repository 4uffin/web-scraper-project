And so many people are like, ‘Oh, I think that was me. That was a conversation we had, right?’ And I’m like, you don’t want to know.” “We like to be a place for original content and for the best storytellers to tell their most meaningful stories. And I feel like we’ve really nailed that this year.” “We made a small show in the middle of Yorkshire last year, and we hope that it would spark a little conversation in the U.K. And now we’re at the Emmys.” “Let me tell you. I’ve been doing this carpet and a lot of people don’t know we exist as a show. So it’s great to get more eyeballs on it.” “It got bigger and weirder and just people responded to what we were doing. We take a lot of risks on the show and I think that’s kind of exciting.” “There was moments where I read some episodes and I was like, can we pull this off? I don’t know?” “Mike White and the characters that come out of his imagination force us to look at ourselves in critical ways.” “That thread of continuity of it all being one day is quite a puzzle, but it’s a fun one. It’s a fun one. I think it offers a very, sort of, unique experience to the viewer.”Voices From the 2025 Emmys Red CarpetNominees for the 77th Emmy Awards spoke with The New York Times on the red carpet ahead of the ceremony on Sunday.By Chevaz Clarke and Matt StevensSeptember 15, 2025TranscriptMore in Culture ›Is ‘South Park’ Cancel-Proof Comedy?2:18Music Festival in Utah Makes Nature Its Venue0:48Jimmy Kimmel Returns to Late Night1:01Late Night Takes On Kimmel’s Suspension and Free Speech1:42‘HIM’ | Anatomy of a Scene2:17The Best Song From ‘KPop Demon Hunters’2:20Latest VideoVisual InvestigationsDiary of a SongMagazineT MagazineOp-DocsOpinionMiddle East CrisisAdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2025 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptionsManage Privacy Preferences
