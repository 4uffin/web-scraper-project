Shades flatter a variety of skin tones. Other things to know: Tip may be small, but it didn't snap off in our tests. Available in 10 colors. Use code PICKUP10; store pickup required.Read the reviewThe Best Drugstore Makeup, Skin Care, and Other Beauty ProductsPosted 3 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickFeit Electric Enhance 60W Replacement Daylight A19 Dimmable LED Light Bulb (8-pack)$13 $16 Save $3Buy from Amazon (pack of eight)What we like: A larger eight-pack of our top daylight LED light bulb pick. Produces a white, cool light that’s suitable for kitchens or offices. Stood out from the competition by offering better color accuracy and more-even dimmability—no buzzing or flickering or plateauing at lower light levels. Other things to know: Five-year warranty, one of the best around. Energy Star rated. Deal is for an 8-pack of bulbs in 2700k soft white. Read the reviewThe Best LED Light BulbPosted 3 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBlack Girl Sunscreen SPF 30$6 $8 Save $2Buy from Woot Free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: Our top pick for a less expensive hydrating chemical face sunscreen. Despite its name, this sunscreen will appeal to a wide array of people. If your skin is prone to dryness, this one leaves a dewy finish on your skin. No white cast. Thick, yet blends smoothly with a bit of elbow grease. Other things to know: Smells faintly of classic sunscreen. Slow to dry. You may not like the sheen if you have oily skin. Free shipping for Prime members.Read the reviewThe Best SunscreenPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Real Techniques Ultra Plush Blush Cheek Makeup Brush$6 $9 Save $3Buy from Ulta Use promo code PICKUP10, with store pickupWhat we like: One of the best cheap makeup brushes that punches above its weight. The brand's distinctive bristles are matte and grippy. Its full-size weighted metallic handles feel high-quality and durable. The dome shapes are unique and sculptural. For the quality, the price per brush is impressive. Other things to know: The brand's bundles include some oddly shaped and redundant tools, so we recommend buying individual brushes for your specific needs. We especially like this brush designed for applying powder products to the cheeks. Use code PICKUP10; store pickup required.Read the reviewThe Best Makeup BrushesPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickTP-Link 5 Port Gigabit Ethernet Network Switch$13 $20 Save $7Buy from Amazon What we like: A staff pick network switch we like if you want to add more Ethernet ports to your router. Frees up wireless bandwidth for other devices, like phones and tablets. A good basic option with 5 ports. Other things to know: Well-reviewed and inexpensive, but they certainly aren’t the only good choices. Recurring deal price.Read the reviewWhat Is a Network Switch, and Do You Need One?Posted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Dreo PolyFan 704S$128 $150 Save $22Buy from Amazon (deal on silver)What we like: The best fan that moves up, down, and all around. Oscillates horizontally and vertically. Powerful, with nine speeds plus a turbo setting. DC-powered motor is energy-efficient and quieter than most. One of the easiest models to clean. Other things to know: Controllable via included remote, app, or smart speaker. Nearly 44 inches tall with an 11-inch diameter. One-year warranty is significantly shorter than that of our other picks (even with the optional 18-month extension). On sale in silver.Read the reviewThe Best FanPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditstaff favoriteWelcome to Jazz Sound Book$12 $20 Save $8Buy from Amazon What we like: Features vivid illustrations of a trio of cats learning the genesis of jazz along with 12 buttons that, when pressed, play the different musical parts of “When the Saints Go Marching In.” Other things to know: A musical book recommended for toddlers in our guide to the best gifts for 3-year olds.Read the reviewThe 43 Best Gifts for 3-Year-OldsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickStaud Tommy Beaded Bag$210 $350 Save $140Buy from Shopbop Free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: A fun bag we like in our guide to the best gifts for girlfriends (that are great for anyone).

The 60 W connection should be just fine for phones, tablets, accessories, and many laptops. Can fast-charge any device that doesn’t demand a 100 W or 240 W connection. Other things to know: Cables are stiffer and have a rougher texture than those of our Belkin pick. Limited to USB 2.0 data-transfer speeds. Deal is for a pack of two 6-foot cables.Read the reviewThe Best USB-C Cables and AdaptersPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringRing Indoor Cam Security Camera (2nd Gen)$25 $60 Save $35Buy from Amazon What we like: A security camera worth considering for those who are all in with Ring. Provides a clear 1080p image and person detection. Removable privacy cover can be manually swiveled to cover the camera while you’re at home. Other things to know: Typically more expensive than our top two picks.

An update to a previous model, adding a slightly better image (2K), better AI (people, vehicles, and packages), and better night vision via Low-Light Sight technology. Other things to know: Fewer features than our top pick, but it does have a removable battery. Our experts found it worked best when set with Auto recording and with Motion Frequency is set to its highest setting, but this drains the battery. Deal is for the plug-in option.Read the reviewThe Best Outdoor Security CameraPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickAquasana AQ-5300+ Max Flow Under-Sink Water Filter$157 $200 Save $43Buy from Amazon (deal on chrome)What we like: Our upgrade pick from our guide to the best under-sink water filter. Same extensive filtration certifications as our top pick, but with a higher flow rate and filter life. Adds a sediment filter — helpful if you have rusty pipes. Other things to know: Replacement filters cost a bit more than our top pick. Physically larger than our top pick. Deal on chrome.Read the reviewThe Best Under-Sink Water FilterPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringRing Battery Doorbell Plus$80 $150 Save $70Buy from Amazon What we like: A smart doorbell camera worth considering if you prefer a camera with a removable rechargeable battery. Records in clear, 1536p HD video, in a square 1:1 aspect ratio, with a 150-by-150-degree field of view. Allows you to record until motion stops (for up to 30 seconds) or have it set to record between 15 and 120 seconds every time. Other things to know: We prefer the long-term battery life and recording quality of our wireless pick, the Eufy S220. Having it set to record for a certain amount of time will drain the battery quicker.Read the reviewThe Best Smart Doorbell CameraPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBrooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe Cooling Hybrid Mattress (Queen, Pillow Top)$1472 $1800 Save $328Buy from Brooklyn Bedding Use promo code WIRECUTTER35 (queen, pillow top)What we like: Our pick for a cloud-like yet supportive hybrid mattress should appeal to back and stomach sleepers, as well as to side sleepers who prefer a firmer mattress. A crowd favorite in our most recent panel test, garnering the most positive feedback of the nine mattresses we tried. Good edge support. Other things to know: We tested the medium with the cloud pillow top, which we think felt medium-firm. Lifetime warranty and a 120-night trial. You must sleep on it for at least 30 days before starting a return, and there’s a $99 return fee. We don't recommend it for people over 200 pounds. Deal is available in all sizes; use promo code WIRECUTTER35.Read the reviewThe Best Hybrid MattressesPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBrooklyn Bedding 3-Inch Talalay Latex Mattress Topper (Queen)$319 $680 Save $361Buy from Brooklyn Bedding Use promo code WIRECUTTER53 (queen)What we like: Our top latex mattress topper pick. Provides good support and pressure-point relief. Squishy, structured, cradling feel: You rest on top of it, rather than being enveloped by it. Ideal for hot sleepers. Comes with a breathable, removable zippered cotton cover. Other things to know: Squishy, jiggly feel can be polarizing. Latex odor takes a little while to dissipate. Lacks corner straps, and may shift. Like all latex bedding, it’s pricey. Three-year warranty. Street price has risen drastically recently, and so have deal prices. Get the deal for the queen size with code WIRECUTTER53.Read the reviewThe Best Mattress ToppersPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickWest Elm Ed Emberley Glow-in-the-Dark Eyes Doormat$27 $39 Save $12Buy from West Elm What we like: A glow-in-the-dark doormat we like in our Halloween decor guide.

Probably won't clean ghosts' shoes. 30"x18". Other doormats we like (a glow-in-the-dark bat option and a non-glowing pumpkins and cat option) are also on sale for a few bucks more.Read the reviewMost Halloween Decor Is Junk.
