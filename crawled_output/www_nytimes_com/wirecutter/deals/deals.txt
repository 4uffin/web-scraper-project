The jumbo-size pieces of this floor puzzle easily fit together to create a 4-foot long safari scene. The large, durable pieces are easy for preschoolers to manipulate on their own (and hard to lose). If you child loves wild animals, this particular theme—with giraffes, an elephant, and a rhinoceros in the savanna—might appeal to them. Other things to know: If a 100-piece puzzle feels too intimidating, start with one of Melissa & Doug’s 48-piece floor puzzles, instead (dinosaurs and the solar system are two options).Read the reviewThe 43 Best Gifts for 3-Year-OldsPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditRunner-upYeti Rambler Tumbler with MagSlider Lid (20 Ounces)$22 $35 Save $13Buy from Public Lands Price reflects in cart with free Public Lands membership, with store pickupWhat we like: Our runner-up tumbler pick for sipping-port users. Has a sloped lip, which makes sipping easy, and the smooth, lid-locking mechanism is easy to operate while you’re driving. Both the tumbler and the lid are dishwasher-safe. Comes apart for easy deep cleaning. Other things to know: The most expensive tumbler we recommend. Leaks more when knocked over, and doesn’t keep drinks as cold as our other picks. Doesn’t come with a straw lid. To avoid shipping fees, choose store pickup or add to a larger order. Price reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands membership (single-use discount).Read the reviewThe Best TumblerPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickMind Reader Bamboo Bathtub Caddy Tray$12 $16 Save $4Buy from Amazon What we like: A simple, fixed wooden tray top pick in our guide to our favorite bath trays. Looks lovely and is easy to use. One of the most affordable models we tested. Sits a little higher than our other picks, this design happened to make it more comfortable to use while reading a book. Other things to know: Not adjustable. Fits average to smaller tubs 30 inches wide or less. You get what you pay with this pick, this tray is not as well made as our other picks.Read the reviewOur Favorite Bath Trays and AccessoriesPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickEltaMD Skin Recovery Amino Acid Foaming Cleanser$28 $35 Save $7Buy from EltaMD Use promo code SUN20What we like: Our upgrade foaming facial cleanser pick for sensitive skin. Cloud-like formula feels light, luxurious, and mild on your hands and face. Sulfate-free soft foam fully removes dirt and grime and leaves your face feeling deeply clean — but not at all stripped. Just one pump emits a dollop that's just the right amount for face-washing. Other things to know: Pretty pricey. 5-ounce bottle. Contains 28 ingredients, making it harder to determine if one of them triggers a sensitivity or irritation. Mostly fragrance-free, with slight hints of coconut and medicine. Use promo code SUN20 to get the deal price and free shipping.Read the reviewThe 8 Best Facial CleansersPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickBlu Dot Dang 1 Drawer Nightstand$556 $695 Save $139Buy from Wayfair (deal on white)What we like: A top-pick nightstand that's heavy-duty with a light look. The deep drawer moves so quietly and smoothly, it's like ASMR — and won't disturb other sleepers. The delicate-looking, brass-tipped legs keep floor space airy. Comes fully assembled, and with a five-year warranty. Other things to know: The white color is pricier than the blue colors. Blu Dot says the brass drawer handle will develop a nice patina over time. Heavy, at 42 pounds. Ships free from Wayfair, a rarity for retailers of this furniture.Read the reviewOur Favorite NightstandsPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditpick variantTCL QM6K Pro Series 4K TV (85-Inch)$900 $1100 Save $200Buy from Costco (Pro model, 85-inch) Costco membership required, price reflects in cartWhat we like: An upgraded variant of our top pick for the best 4K TV on a budget. Features mini-LED backlighting and better local dimming than previous TCL models in the same price range. Highly accurate color. Runs Google TV, our favorite streaming platform. Gamer-friendly with low input lag and up to a 144 Hz refresh rate (rare in the budget category). Other things to know: Not bright enough for comfortable use in a well-lit room. Falls short of higher-tier TVs in tcolor vividness. Doesn't deliver great off-angle viewing. Pro model can do higher VRR, plus has pre-tuned speakers, and better reflection handling on the screen. On sale in the 85-inch size. Costco membership required, price reflects in cart.Read the reviewThe Best 4K TV on a BudgetPosted less than 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickBlu Dot Dang 1 Drawer Nightstand$476 $595 Save $119Buy from Wayfair (deal on marine blue or navy green)What we like: A top-pick nightstand that's heavy-duty with a light look. The deep drawer moves so quietly and smoothly, it's like ASMR — and won't disturb other sleepers. The delicate-looking, brass-tipped legs keep floor space airy.

Has everything we like about the our top pick in terms of reliability and consistent grind size, plus a few improved features. Faster and more consistent, and offers a wider range of grind sizes. Precise digital timer allows you to grind a set amount of beans  without measuring each time you make coffee. Other things to know: Finnicky dial can be a little annoying. Not significantly better than our top pick at grinding, just has some more features and incremental improvements. More suited for enthusiasts and hobbyists. Almost every part of the machine is repairable or replaceable.Read the reviewThe Best Coffee GrinderPosted 1 hour agoCopy linkEditTop pickBaratza Encore Coffee Grinder$120 $150 Save $30Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top coffee grinder pick grinds coffee more evenly, and on a wider range of settings, than any other machine we’ve tested in the same price range. A workhorse that produces the consistent grind our experts seek. Reliable, modestly-sized, and easy to use. Also easy to clean and maintain. An investment you can rely on morning after morning. Other things to know: The grind of your beans plays an important part in getting that perfect cuppa. Won’t produce the tiny adjustments in fine grinds that thrill serious espresso enthusiasts, but can still produce fine enough grounds to pull a decent shot.Read the reviewThe Best Coffee GrinderPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickFintie Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2$20 $26 Save $6Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top pick for an affordable slim case for the Nintendo Switch 2. Outside has a sturdy hard shell with raised panels on the front cover. Effectively prevented us from pushing the Switch’s joysticks down through the case when it was closed. Inner compartment has a mesh zipper pocket that fits the charger and a couple of Joy-Cons. Other things to know: Best if you don't need to take many accessories with you. Separate inner flap holds up to 10 game cards. Several colors on sale for $20 but the blue starry night pattern is just $18.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickRomp Bass Vibrating Anal Plug$23 $30 Save $7Buy from Romp Use promo code AFF-WIRECUTTERWhat we like: Our budget anal toy pick is a silicone option that offers great value. Suitable for everyone from beginners to advanced users. A solid toy, whether you use the vibration features or not. Other things to know: Should not be used with silicone lubricants.

Use promo code AFF-WIRECUTTER.Read the reviewThe Best Anal ToysPosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBioLite Luci Charge 360 Lantern$48 $60 Save $12Buy from BioLite Use promo code WCTR20What we like: Our top packable outdoor light pick. Inflatable, highly portable, and easy to use. One of the brightest we've tested. Four light settings. Can charge phones and small devices. IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating. Charges via USB-C port (cable included) or built-in solar panel. Other things to know: One of the heaviest models we've tested. Inflating and deflating takes time and energy. Moisture from breath leaves smudges on the inside surface. There’s also a risk of tearing or puncturing the material. One-year warranty. Use code WCTR20.Read the reviewOutdoor and Backyard Lighting We LovePosted 2 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickNebula Mars 3 Air Portable Mini Projector (Refurbished)$300 $425 Save $125Buy from eBay (refurbished) Use promo code LOVETOSAVEWhat we like: Our top portable mini projector pick, available refurbished. 1080p projector that offers good image brightness and contrast with above-average sound and easy setup. Runs off an internal battery for true portability (up to 3.5 hours of runtime in our tests). Uses the Google TV streaming platform, which is our favorite. Other things to know: Main downsides include lack of USB-C port and the awkwardly designed underside, which limits the tripods and mounts it can attach to. Certified refurbished with 2-year warranty provided by Allstate. Use promo code LOVETOSAVE.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Mini ProjectorPosted 17 hours agoCopy linkEditpick variantLG WM4080HWA Washing Machine and LG DLEX4080W Electric Dryer$1400 $1650 Save $250Buy from Costco Costco membership required, price reflects in cartWhat we like: Models nearly identical to our top washing machine and matching dryer picks. Front-loading washer is gentle and great at removing all types of stains. Both machines are fast and quiet, with large capacities. Water- and energy-efficient. Wi-Fi–enabled for connecting to LG ThinQ app. Other things to know: Can be loud. Control panel is hard to see in the dark. LG's customer service is relatively lousy, but Costco's is relatively good. Two-year warranty. 90-day returns.

Impressive noise cancellation and good sound for under $100. Comfortable and lightweight. 40-hour battery life with ANC on. Offers dual-device connectivity, hear-through mode, and quick-charge feature. Other things to know: The three noise-reducing microphones can make voices sound compressed and somewhat distant to callers. Layout of physical control buttons makes sense, but they're small and take practice to master. Customizable sound via Soundcore app. Available certified refurbished via Anker's eBay storefront, with a two-year Allstate warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Noise-Cancelling HeadphonesPosted 18 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringAnker Nebula Capsule 3 Laser Projector (Refurbished)$360 $580 Save $220Buy from eBay (refurbished) Use promo code LOVETOSAVEWhat we like: A refurbished portable mini projector worth considering for watching movies in a dark room. Superior image contrast and color accuracy. Black levels help movies look good in the dark. Built-in battery and USB-C charging.
