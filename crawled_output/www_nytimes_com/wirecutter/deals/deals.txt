We love the Lego Advent calendars because they offer one mini build a day—for adults and kids alike. The Lego City advent calendar allows you to assemble a traditional holiday scene with Santa and Mrs. Claus minifigures, a sleigh, a tree and more. Other things to know: The build instructions are on the back of the little doors. Recommended for ages five and up.Read the reviewOur 20 Favorite Advent Calendars of 2025Posted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditLightning DealTop pickHomwe Extra Long Professional Silicone Oven Mitt (Set of 2)$14 $18 Save $4Buy from Amazon (deal on red)What we like: Our top pick for the best oven mitts. Heatproof, flexible, and sturdy design. Extra-long cuffs. Grippy, easy-to-maneuver, and water-resistant silicone exterior. Comfy polyester and cotton quilted inner lining. Machine-washable and dryer-safe. Other things to know: Not very roomy in the cuff, with a circumference of about 12 inches. Like any other silicone mitt, these retain heat. Not the prettiest. Street price has risen significantly over the years. Lightning deal is for a set of two in red.Read the reviewThe Best Oven Mitts and Pot HoldersPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...La Roche-Posay 12% Pure Vitamin C Serum$35 $45 Save $10Buy from Amazon Buy from Ulta What we like: The best rich, skin-smoothing vitamin C serum drops, in an updated formula with 2% more vitamin C. Pretty impressive for a drugstore brand. A hearty 12% ascorbic acid gel that seemingly melts into skin to leave a sheer, touchable finish. Ingredients include glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and salicylic acid. Other things to know: Testers didn't love the baby powder–meets–medicinal scent. White dropper can get gummy, discolored, and dingy over time, and it doesn’t always deliver a precise portion. It's pricey for a drugstore brand. We tested this at a 10% concentration, but the updated 12% formula otherwise remains largely the same.Read the reviewThe Best Vitamin C SerumsPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickLego Creator 3in1 Magical Unicorn 31140$7 $9 Save $2Buy from Amazon What we like: A bite-size brick set staff pick in our guide to kids birthday party favors that aren't junk. The lower-price mini builds make perfect party favors. This Lego kit can transform from a unicorn to a seahorse to a peacock. Other things to know: Lego recommends this kit for kids ages 7 and up. 145-pieces.Read the review31 Kids Birthday Party Favors That Aren’t JunkPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickBrother P-touch PT-N25BT Personal Connected Label Maker$30 $37 Save $7Buy from Amazon What we like: Our new top label maker pick. Our cheapest pick, but feature-packed, with a large selection of fonts and symbols. Best of both worlds with a smartphone app and a built-in screen and keyboard. Consistently printed crisp labels that survived our durability tests. Uses inexpensive tape. Other things to know: Takes six AAA batteries or an AC adapter (neither are included). Keyboard is small. Needs to manually connect to the iPrint&Label app each time you turn it on. Like all Brother label makers we recommend, it wastes up to 2.5 cm of tape when printing on a continuous roll.Read the reviewThe Best Label MakersPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickChicco KidFit ClearTex Plus Booster Car Seat$88 $100 Save $12Buy from Target Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top high-back booster car seat pick. Cleverly designed LATCH system for easy installation. Two collapsible cupholders. The best seat-belt threader of any other seat we tested. Narrow, space-saving frame will fit a child for years. Converts from a high-back to backless booster. Other things to know: Weighs about 10 pounds. No storage for detached LATCH connectors. Fits kids that are 38 to 57 inches tall with a weight range of 40 to 100 pounds in high-back mode, and 40 to 110 pounds in backless mode. A little pricey, and the list price has recently risen. Drift gray color is on sale.Read the reviewThe Best Booster Car SeatsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickMzoo Sleep Mask$11 $23 Save $12Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page coupon (deal on black)What we like: Our top padded, contoured sleep mask pick. Soft, adjustable, and comfortable. Drops the world into complete darkness as soon as you put it on. Goggle-like design keeps a little space between the mask and a wearer's eyes. Stays put all night. Best for side- and back-sleepers. Other things to know: Also recommended in our travel gear guide. Compression of memory foam isn't for everyone, as it puts some pressure on orbital bone and eye socket. Hand-wash only. Deal price is for the black color, with clipped on-page coupon. We briefly saw blue drop lower, but this is still a good deal.Read the reviewThe Best Sleep MaskPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upChicco KeyFit Max ClearTex Car Seat$200 $250 Save $50Buy from Target Price reflects in cartWhat we like: Our runner-up infant car seat pick. Simple to install and use. Includes an anti-rebound base and a European belt path for easier non-base installs when traveling — a major plus for families who frequently travel or take taxis. Also has a convenient no-rethread harness (similar to our top pick). Other things to know: Accommodates passengers up to 32 inches and 30 pounds. Weighs 10 pounds. Works with many (but not all) Chicco strollers without an adapter. Installing the base with the seat belt is a bit harder than for our top pick. Deal price reflects in cart. Circle holders save an additional 5% (and potentially 20% with trade-in).Read the reviewThe Best Infant Car SeatsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickPop Chart 100 Horror Movies Scratch-Off Print$19 $25 Save $6Buy from Amazon (horror movies edition) What we like: An under-$25 gift pick we also recommend for dads. One part bragging board, one part movie-night idea generator. This good-looking scratch-off poster is a must-watch list of horror movies. The perfect gift for a cinephile. Other things to know: It’s exciting to scrape off each square like a lottery ticket, but if your recipient is feeling impatient, they can uncover them all and enjoy a lovely poster. On sale for a bit less in a sci-fi movie print, too.Read the reviewThe 68 Best Gifts Under $25Posted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upCascade Platinum Plus ActionPacs Dishwasher Pods (82-Count)$27 $32 Save $5Buy from Costco (82-count) Costco membership required, price includes $3 shippingWhat we like: Our runner-up pick for the best dishwasher detergent, in a jumbo quantity. Cleaned nearly as well as our top pick in testing. Equipped with liquid detergent boosters designed to cut grease and enhance shine. Other things to know: Contains dyes, whereas our top pick does not. Has a strong “fresh” scent, but it neutralized food odors well in our tests. 82 pods. Deal available for Costco members, price includes $3 shipping. One of the best prices per pod that we've seen.Read the reviewThe Best Dishwasher DetergentPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditAlso greatCutter Backwoods Dry Insect Repellent$4 $7 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: Our DEET-based bug repellent pick. Good if you experience rash reactions to picaridin repellents. Even-spraying aerosol. Locking cap. Protects against mosquitoes and ticks for up to 10 hours. Smells milder and feels less oily than other DEET-based options we tried. Other things to know: DEET formulas work well and are widely available, but they aren’t more effective than picaridin and can damage plastic and synthetic fabrics. Deal is for a single 4-ounce aerosol spray can. Not returnable. Has seen a street price increase recently and this is the best discount we've noted in 2025.Read the reviewThe Best Bug RepellentsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditRunner-upSimpliSafe Home Security System Kit (13-Piece Kit)$200 $300 Save $100Buy from Costco (13-piece kit) Costco membership requiredWhat we like: A larger version of our runner-up home security system pick. Affordable and reliable. Easy to use and install. Consistent response times. Compatible with voice-control systems including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and August Smart Locks. Good selection of add-ons. Other things to know: Optional monitoring plan is slightly cheaper than that of our top pick, but doesn’t provide video storage. Kit includes base station, keypad, motion sensor, eight entry sensors, two outdoor cameras. Costco membership required; limit of two per member.Read the reviewThe Best Home Security SystemPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditTop pickOXO Good Grips 3-Tier Aluminum Shower Caddy$42 $52 Save $10Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cart, with store pickupWhat we like: Our longtime top pick for the best shower caddy. High-quality and durable. The easiest of our picks to install. Grippy rubberized hook and suction cups add stability. Keeps bottles of varying sizes tidy and accessible. Holds more than most others we tested. Other things to know: Doesn't adjust up and down. Top shelf may be too high to reach for some. Generally, suction cups don’t work well on uneven or porous tile surfaces. Lifetime guarantee. Price reflects in cart; select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.  Read the reviewThe Best Shower CaddyPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringKenmore SpotLite Portable Carpet Spot & Pet Stain Cleaner Vac$89 $100 Save $11Buy from Amazon What we like: A portable carpet and upholstery cleaner worth considering as an alternative to Bissell. Gets the job done. Scored slightly higher on our carpet-cleaning test than our best-for pick, and beat that model by a whisker on coffee and red-wine stains. Other things to know: A bit clunky. Inflexible hose. Comes with a trial size of Kenmore’s cleaning solution, but it can’t be purchased online; a Kenmore spokesperson told us that any cleaning formula can be used with the machine.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Carpet and Upholstery CleanerPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringAluratek Streamcast Pro Wireless HDMI Video Transmitter$60 $80 Save $20Buy from Amazon With delayed shippingWhat we like: A wireless HDMI video transmitter worth considering if you want an affordable in-room option that’s good for travel. Wi-Fi–based system that can transmit 1080p 60 Hz video and stereo audio. Transmitter and receiver units are basic HDMI dongles with no other connections beyond USB-C power ports. Other things to know: Has no HDMI or IR pass-through, as you get with our picks. To send a signal from a computer that lacks HDMI, you need either a USB-C–to–HDMI or Lightning-to-HDMI adapter cable (sold separately). Despite the claimed specs, this system is not good for broadcasting over longer distances. Delayed shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Wireless HDMI Video TransmitterPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditBest for...Windmill AC with WhisperTech$400 $450 Save $50Buy from Walmart What we like: The best air conditioner for easy installation. One of the nicest-looking options we’ve ever tested, with rounded corners and subtle indicator lights that won’t keep you up at night. Pre-installed frame fits right in the window with a stylish plastic cover over the back. Inverter compressor is just as efficient as our top pick. Other things to know: You can’t open your window while using it. Typically more expensive than our top pick and a little louder. Window support bracket not included. You can’t control the direction of the fan.Read the reviewThe Best Air ConditionerPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditTop pickLeatherman Skeletool CX Multi-Tool$72 $90 Save $18Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: Our longtime top multi-tool pick. Lightweight and slim. Built to last. Has all essentials you'll likely need day-to-day, including needle-nose and regular pliers, wire cutters, two Phillips screwdrivers, two flat screwdrivers, and a handy carabiner clip. Other things to know: Odd asymmetrical design, but it works well ergonomically. Some tools, like scissors, not included. Handles may spread a little too wide for those with smaller hands. Pricey, a worthy investment. Blunt plier tips. 25-year warranty. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Multi-ToolPosted 2 days agoCopy linkEditTop pickYeti Hondo Beach Chair$240 $300 Save $60Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: Our pick for the best rugged and comfortable, built-to-last beach chair. Very sturdy and supportive. Features a tensioned fabric seat, a rock-solid frame, and wide feet that don’t sink in sand. With four reclining positions, it’s an easy chair to fall asleep in. Built for a lifetime. Other things to know: Wide enough (25 inches) to accommodate a range of body types without feeling cramped. Heavier and more expensive than our other picks. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Beach ChairsPosted 2 days agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
