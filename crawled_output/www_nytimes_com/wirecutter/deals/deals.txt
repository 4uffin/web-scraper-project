Runs off an internal battery for true portability (up to 3.5 hours of runtime in our tests). Uses the Google TV streaming platform, which is our favorite. Other things to know: Main downsides include lack of USB-C port and the awkwardly designed underside, which limits the tripods and mounts it can attach to. Certified refurbished with 2-year warranty provided by Allstate. Use promo code LOVETOSAVE.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Mini ProjectorPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditpick variantLG WM4080HWA Washing Machine and LG DLEX4080W Electric Dryer$1400 $1650 Save $250Buy from Costco Costco membership required, price reflects in cartWhat we like: Models nearly identical to our top washing machine and matching dryer picks. Front-loading washer is gentle and great at removing all types of stains. Both machines are fast and quiet, with large capacities. Water- and energy-efficient. Wi-Fi–enabled for connecting to LG ThinQ app. Other things to know: Can be loud. Control panel is hard to see in the dark. LG's customer service is relatively lousy, but Costco's is relatively good. Two-year warranty. 90-day returns. Price reflects in cart for Costco members; includes installation, parts, and haul away services.Read the reviewThe Best Washing Machines (and Their Matching Dryers)Posted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditBudget pickSoundcore Space One Noise-Cancelling Headphones (Refurbished)$59 $80 Save $21Buy from eBay (refurbished) Use promo code LOVETOSAVEWhat we like: Our budget over-ear noise-cancelling headphones pick. Impressive noise cancellation and good sound for under $100. Comfortable and lightweight. 40-hour battery life with ANC on. Offers dual-device connectivity, hear-through mode, and quick-charge feature. Other things to know: The three noise-reducing microphones can make voices sound compressed and somewhat distant to callers. Layout of physical control buttons makes sense, but they're small and take practice to master. Customizable sound via Soundcore app. Available certified refurbished via Anker's eBay storefront, with a two-year Allstate warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Noise-Cancelling HeadphonesPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringAnker Nebula Capsule 3 Laser Projector (Refurbished)$360 $580 Save $220Buy from eBay (refurbished) Use promo code LOVETOSAVEWhat we like: A refurbished portable mini projector worth considering for watching movies in a dark room. Superior image contrast and color accuracy. Black levels help movies look good in the dark. Built-in battery and USB-C charging. Speaker sounds full and balanced. Other things to know: Not as bright as similarly priced competitors. Pixel structure is very visible and distracting for a 1080p projector. Remote response time can be sluggish. Anker certified refurbished with two year warranty provided by Allstate. Use code LOVETOSAVE, bringing the deal price down to the lowest we've seen for a refurbished modelRead the reviewThe Best Portable Mini ProjectorPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickLoop Quiet 2 Earplugs$17 $20 Save $3Buy from Woot Free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: An upcoming top pick (for those seeking a reusable option) in our guide to the best earplugs for sleeping.

Fit snug and comfortably, even for side sleepers. Other things to know: Made from lightweight, flexible silicone. Comes with 4 ear tip sizes. Deal on the gold color only. Free shipping for Prime members.Read the reviewThe Best Earplugs for SleepingPosted 4 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickDyson Supersonic Hair Dryer (Refurbished)$176 $300 Save $124Buy from eBay (refurbished) Use promo code LOVETOSAVE (deal on fuchsia or blue)What we like: A longtime upgrade hair dryer pick. Unique design makes for an extraordinarily pleasant user experience. No vibration whatsoever. Simple-to-switch magnetic attachments make styling a breeze. Consistently our favorite to use since we first tested it in 2016. Other things to know: Pricey, and doesn’t make your hair look any different than cheaper options. Manufacturer refurbished, with one-year Dyson warranty. Comes with five attachments. On sale in fuchsia or blue, with code LOVETOSAVE.Read the reviewThe Best Hair DryerPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickEpicka Universal Travel Adapter$18 $22 Save $4Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page coupon (deal on gray or white)What we like: Our top travel plug adapter pick. Also recommended in multiple gift guides. Comes with the three most common international plugs, a US-style plug, and a nylon case. Compact and well-built. Has four standard USB-A ports and one USB-C port. Charged more devices faster than competitors during our tests. Other things to know: If you’re using all five ports, you won’t be able to charge all connected devices at full speed. No universal travel adapter is truly universal, and they’re all bulkier and more expensive than simple plug adapters. Clip the on-page coupon for a deal on gray or white.Read the reviewThe Best Travel Plug AdapterPosted 5 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickSteam Deck LCD (256 GB)$320 $400 Save $80Buy from Steam What we like: Our new top pick for the best handheld gaming console. Easy to use. Excellent battery life. Consistent performance. Offers great control options — including analog thumbsticks and two tiny trackpads — for a variety of PC titles, including strategy games. Other things to know: Official support is limited to Steam. Less powerful than the competition. Display is only so-so. Gets louder than we'd like. Still seems just a little unfinished. Offers access to most of Steam's catalog (some games are not supported).  Read the reviewThe Best Game ConsolesPosted 6 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Sungait Vintage Round Sunglasses (Polarized Lenses)$6 $12 Save $6Buy from Amazon With clipped on-page coupon and promo code 3L59BRL2 (deal on black frames)What we like: The best cheap round sunglasses. Also recommended in gift guides and outdoor guides. Comfortable and sturdy. Complements a variety of face shapes. Keyhole nose bridge. Mini screwdriver provided with purchase. Logo-free and unisex. Other things to know: Some pairs of Sungait glasses sold on Amazon don't have polarized lenses; double-check before buying. Lifetime warranty (rare at this price). Clip the on-page coupon and use code 3L59BRL2 for a deal on the black frames with gray polarized lenses.Read the reviewThe Best Cheap SunglassesPosted 6 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickTramontina 10-Inch Professional Restaurant Fry Pan (2-Pack)$32 $40 Save $8Buy from Costco (pack of two) Costco membership required, price includes $3 shippingWhat we like: Our top nonstick pan pick in a set of two. Durable coating. Good heat distribution. Excellent maneuverability. With its classic flared-lip shape, slick nonstick coating, and comfortable handle, these quality pans will last for years. Other things to know: Not compatible with induction cooktops. The rivets that secure the handles to the pans don’t have a nonstick coating. Deal is for a set of two; price includes a $3 delivery fee. Costco membership required.Read the reviewThe Best Nonstick PanPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upGE GNE27J French-Door Refrigerator$1300 $1600 Save $300Buy from Costco Costco membership required, price reflects in cartWhat we like: Our runner-up French-door refrigerator pick. Similar to our top pick, but with more-versatile shelving. Produces nearly twice as much ice as our top pick. High overall levels of satisfaction for important qualities like capacity, looks, and reliability. Other things to know: No smart features. GE's customer service seemed to generate fewer negative sentiments among our survey respondents. Bigger footprint than our top pick (mostly depth) without providing much more capacity. Price reflects in cart for Costco members.Read the reviewThe Best French Door RefrigeratorsPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (16-Ounce Jar + 16-Ounce Pump Jar)$24 $30 Save $6Buy from Costco (16-ounce jar + 16-ounce pump jar) Costco membership requiredWhat we like: A bundle of the best body lotion for all-around hydration. Also one of our facial moisturizer picks. A dermatologist favorite. Simple, versatile formula feels more luxurious than its price suggests. Absorbs quickly without feeling sticky or leaving a greasy layer on skin. Suitable for both body and face. Other things to know: Several testers thought scooping out the cream by hand was unsanitary. Fragrance-free, but still has a faint, slightly medicinal smell. Costco membership required to get deal on a bundle that includes a 16-ounce jar and 16-ounce pump jar.Read the reviewThe Best Body LotionsPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringTrue Botanicals Ginger Turmeric Cleansing Balm$40 $52 Save $12Buy from True Botanicals Use promo code WIRECUTTERWhat we like: A facial cleansing balm worth considering for a double-cleansing routine. Offers a significantly elevated experience. Comes in a glass jar with a tiny bamboo (not plastic) spatula used to scrape up a perfect portion. Chic ginger-scented formula immediately transforms into a silky oil that melts away makeup and schmutz. Other things to know: On the more expensive side. Leaves skin feeling moist and juicy, but some might perceive that as feeling greasy. Use code WIRECUTTER.Read the reviewThe 8 Best Facial CleansersPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditGuest pickVersionTECH USB Mini Handheld Fan$13 $16 Save $3Buy from Amazon (deal on black)What we like: A handheld rechargeable fan recommended by a Disney content creator in an article by Carlye Wisel, a theme-park journalist, about everything she brings to Disney. A lifesaver in the blazing sun and heat of a Florida theme park. Other things to know: We've seen it drop a dollar more, but it's still a good value at this price. On sale in the black color.Read the reviewEverything Theme-Park Journalist Carlye Wisel Brings to DisneyPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickUSA Pan Rectangle Cake Pan$21 $28 Save $7Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top rectangular cake pan pick is indispensable for the simplest brownies, bar cookies, and single-layer sheet cakes. Nonstick coating feels durable. The edges and corners of our cakes came out clean and sharp. Great price for such a heavy-duty, sturdy pan. Comes with a limited lifetime warranty. Other things to know: The corrugated sides help release cakes easily, they don’t mar the edges of the cake too much. The list price has gone up slightly in recent months, as has the deal price.Read the reviewThe Best Cake PansPosted 9 hours agoCopy linkEditBest for...Coola Original Liplux Lip Balm Sunscreen$9 $12 Save $3Buy from Amazon Buy from Ulta With store pickupWhat we like: The best smooth and invisible lip balm with SPF. Lightweight, with no white cast. Formulated with moisturizing oils and three chemical sunscreens to hydrate and protect lips. Sturdy metal tube. Colorless and can be worn over lipstick. Beachy scent. Other things to know: Uses FDA-approved filters avobenzone, octisalate, and octocrylene. Some of our staff disliked the SPF-synthetic-induced aftertaste and stopped using it. As with most sunscreens, reapply every two hours for full sun protection. Select store pickup at Ulta.Read the reviewThe Best Lip BalmsPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringRoku Streaming Stick Plus$29 $40 Save $11Buy from Amazon What we like: A less expensive alternative to our Roku media streaming device pick. Considerably smaller and lighter. Solves the “hanging dongle” design that many folks disliked about the Express models. Stick can be powered via USB. Supports 4K and HDR10/HDR10+. Other things to know: Still in testing. Comes with updated Roku remote. Connects directly to your TV’s HDMI input, no cable needed. Doesn't support Dolby Vision or Dolby Atmos. USB-to-AC adapters not included.Read the reviewThe Best Media Streaming DevicesPosted 10 hours agoCopy linkEditAlso greatNespresso VertuoPlus + Aeroccino Milk Frother$120 $169 Save $49Buy from Bloomingdale's (Aeroccino milk frother bundle) What we like: Our more versatile Nespresso machine pick. Brews smooth espresso, plus an 8-ounce cup of coffee that’s superior to anything we’ve tried from a Keurig. Short learning curve, with just one button and an automatic lid. Adjustable drip tray and water tank. Other things to know: Cups are unstable on drip tray. We didn’t love the coffee, but it was still a big step up from Keurig coffee. Only uses Vertuo pods, which cost more than Original Nespresso pods. Aeroccino3 milk frother is a nice add-on, but we prefer our picks.Read the reviewThe Best Nespresso MachinePosted 10 hours agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
