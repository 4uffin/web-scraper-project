Translucent, jelly-like cream leaves skin feeling instantly refreshed and replenished. Goes on sheer and plumps up skin. Featherweight texture. Dosed with powerhouse moisturizers like glycerin and sodium hyaluronate. Other things to know: Delivers long-lasting moisture. No perfumes added but smells slightly medicinal. Some testers didn't like putting their fingers into a tub. Product names within the Hydro Boost line are confusing.Read the reviewThe Best MoisturizersPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upCascade Platinum Plus ActionPacs Dishwasher Pods (82-Count)$27 $32 Save $5Buy from Costco (82-count) Costco membership required, price includes $3 shippingWhat we like: Our runner-up pick for the best dishwasher detergent, in a jumbo quantity. Cleaned nearly as well as our top pick in testing. Equipped with liquid detergent boosters designed to cut grease and enhance shine. Other things to know: Contains dyes, whereas our top pick does not. Has a strong “fresh” scent, but it neutralized food odors well in our tests. 82 pods. Deal available for Costco members, price includes $3 shipping. One of the best prices per pod that we've seen.Read the reviewThe Best Dishwasher DetergentPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditgift pickWolf-Garten Interlocken Push Pull Weeder$25 $30 Save $5Buy from Amazon What we like: A weeder gift pick recommended for gardeners or your mother-in-law. The double-sided blade on this weeder slides back and forth under the soil, nipping weeds at their roots and loosening packed dirt. It’s basically a more versatile version of Wirecutter’s favorite stirrup hoe. Other things to know: You’ll have to buy the handle (which is not on sale) separately.Read the reviewThe 27 Best Gifts for GardenersPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditAlso greatCutter Backwoods Dry Insect Repellent$4 $7 Save $3Buy from Amazon What we like: Our DEET-based bug repellent pick. Good if you experience rash reactions to picaridin repellents. Even-spraying aerosol. Locking cap. Protects against mosquitoes and ticks for up to 10 hours. Smells milder and feels less oily than other DEET-based options we tried. Other things to know: DEET formulas work well and are widely available, but they aren’t more effective than picaridin and can damage plastic and synthetic fabrics. Deal is for a single 4-ounce aerosol spray can. Not returnable. Has seen a street price increase recently and this is the best discount we've noted in 2025.Read the reviewThe Best Bug RepellentsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditRunner-upSimpliSafe Home Security System Kit (13-Piece Kit)$200 $300 Save $100Buy from Costco (13-piece kit) Costco membership requiredWhat we like: A larger version of our runner-up home security system pick. Affordable and reliable. Easy to use and install. Consistent response times. Compatible with voice-control systems including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and August Smart Locks. Good selection of add-ons. Other things to know: Optional monitoring plan is slightly cheaper than that of our top pick, but doesn’t provide video storage. Kit includes base station, keypad, motion sensor, eight entry sensors, two outdoor cameras. Costco membership required; limit of two per member.Read the reviewThe Best Home Security SystemPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickOXO Good Grips 3-Tier Aluminum Shower Caddy$42 $52 Save $10Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cart, with store pickupWhat we like: Our longtime top pick for the best shower caddy. High-quality and durable. The easiest of our picks to install. Grippy rubberized hook and suction cups add stability. Keeps bottles of varying sizes tidy and accessible. Holds more than most others we tested. Other things to know: Doesn't adjust up and down. Top shelf may be too high to reach for some. Generally, suction cups don’t work well on uneven or porous tile surfaces. Lifetime guarantee. Price reflects in cart; select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.  Read the reviewThe Best Shower CaddyPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringKenmore SpotLite Portable Carpet Spot & Pet Stain Cleaner Vac$89 $100 Save $11Buy from Amazon What we like: A portable carpet and upholstery cleaner worth considering as an alternative to Bissell. Gets the job done. Scored slightly higher on our carpet-cleaning test than our best-for pick, and beat that model by a whisker on coffee and red-wine stains. Other things to know: A bit clunky. Inflexible hose. Comes with a trial size of Kenmore’s cleaning solution, but it can’t be purchased online; a Kenmore spokesperson told us that any cleaning formula can be used with the machine.Read the reviewThe Best Portable Carpet and Upholstery CleanerPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditWorth consideringAluratek Streamcast Pro Wireless HDMI Video Transmitter$60 $80 Save $20Buy from Amazon With delayed shippingWhat we like: A wireless HDMI video transmitter worth considering if you want an affordable in-room option that’s good for travel. Wi-Fi–based system that can transmit 1080p 60 Hz video and stereo audio. Transmitter and receiver units are basic HDMI dongles with no other connections beyond USB-C power ports. Other things to know: Has no HDMI or IR pass-through, as you get with our picks. To send a signal from a computer that lacks HDMI, you need either a USB-C–to–HDMI or Lightning-to-HDMI adapter cable (sold separately). Despite the claimed specs, this system is not good for broadcasting over longer distances. Delayed shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Wireless HDMI Video TransmitterPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Windmill AC with WhisperTech$400 $450 Save $50Buy from Walmart What we like: The best air conditioner for easy installation. One of the nicest-looking options we’ve ever tested, with rounded corners and subtle indicator lights that won’t keep you up at night. Pre-installed frame fits right in the window with a stylish plastic cover over the back. Inverter compressor is just as efficient as our top pick. Other things to know: You can’t open your window while using it. Typically more expensive than our top pick and a little louder. Window support bracket not included. You can’t control the direction of the fan.Read the reviewThe Best Air ConditionerPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickLeatherman Skeletool CX Multi-Tool$72 $90 Save $18Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: Our longtime top multi-tool pick. Lightweight and slim. Built to last. Has all essentials you'll likely need day-to-day, including needle-nose and regular pliers, wire cutters, two Phillips screwdrivers, two flat screwdrivers, and a handy carabiner clip. Other things to know: Odd asymmetrical design, but it works well ergonomically. Some tools, like scissors, not included. Handles may spread a little too wide for those with smaller hands. Pricey, a worthy investment. Blunt plier tips. 25-year warranty. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Multi-ToolPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickYeti Hondo Beach Chair$240 $300 Save $60Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: Our pick for the best rugged and comfortable, built-to-last beach chair. Very sturdy and supportive. Features a tensioned fabric seat, a rock-solid frame, and wide feet that don’t sink in sand. With four reclining positions, it’s an easy chair to fall asleep in. Built for a lifetime. Other things to know: Wide enough (25 inches) to accommodate a range of body types without feeling cramped. Heavier and more expensive than our other picks. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Beach ChairsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickREI Co-op Kindercone 25 Kids Sleeping Bag$49 $70 Save $21Buy from REI With store pickup or REI membership (deal on green or clay)What we like: Our top for the best kids sleeping bag. Recycled polyester shell and lining that insulate against the cold. Coated with a durable water repellent to protect against moisture. Handy cinch feature customizes sleeping area based on your child's size. Other things to know: Bulky when packed, so better suited to car camping and sleepovers than backpacking. Stuff sack is permanently attached to the bag, making it easy to pack and keep track of. Deal on green or clay. Ships free for REI members; others can select store pickup to avoid shipping fees.Read the reviewThe Best Kids Sleeping BagsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Leatherman Signal Multi-Tool$112 $140 Save $28Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: The best multi-tool for the outdoorsperson. Same set of basic tools as our top pick with additional outdoor and emergency-oriented tools, such as an effective whistle and fire starter. Versatile and durable enough for camping or hiking. Other things to know: Heavier and bulkier than our top pick, but also more robust. Knife is partially serrated, which isn't our favorite. An investment, but we consider it to be a lifetime tool. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Multi-ToolPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Yeti Crossroads 22″/35L Wheeled Carry-On Luggage$280 $350 Save $70Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: The best carry-on for tough conditions. Polycarbonate back and rugged two-wheel design are ideal for rougher travel over difficult surfaces, such as broken streets and uneven curbs. Well-organized and a pleasure to pack. Easy-to-repair parts. Other things to know: Somewhat unwieldy to handle. Weather-resistant, but not waterproof. Front-facing laptop organizer is unshielded. Limited three-year warranty. Comes in four colors. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Carry-On LuggagePosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest for...Yeti Panga 50L Waterproof Duffel$240 $300 Save $60Buy from Public Lands Free Public Lands membership required, single-use discount reflects in cartWhat we like: The best duffle bag for keeping things dry. The absolute toughest, most durable duffle we recommend. Waterproof even when submerged completely. Solid metal hardware. Includes a plethora of lash points. Comfortable to carry. Also works as a backpack. Other things to know: All that weatherproofing isn’t light — this is the heaviest bag we tested, weighing more than five pounds empty. Pricey, even on sale. Single-use discount reflects in cart when signed in with free Public Lands account.Read the reviewThe Best Duffel BagsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickLego Classic Medium Creative Brick Box 10696$18 $20 Save $2Buy from Target With store pickup or Circle CardWhat we like: Our top pick for the best bulk box of Lego bricks for kids. Comes with a large variety of shapes in 35 colors, all housed in a distinctive Lego-shaped yellow box. A time-tested choice that offers instructions for a few basic projects and endless possibilities for more. Other things to know: The plastic tote container has room for more as your collection grows. The lid doesn't latch, which could lead to spills. 484 pieces. Recommended for ages four and up. Choose store pickup, use Target Circle Card, or add to an order of $35 or more to avoid shipping fees. Read the reviewThe Best Lego Sets for KidsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBest forOXO Good Grips Quick-Extend Aluminum Pole Caddy$119 $170 Save $51Buy from The Container Store Price reflects in cartWhat we like: The best pole-style shower caddy. Keeps showers tidy without cluttering the showerhead area. Super-sturdy. Four adjustable shelves. Tension rod extends from five to nine feet and locks into place. Easy to install and clean. Ideal for bathrooms shared by two or more people. Other things to know: OXO claims the anodized aluminum finish will never rust. More expensive than a hanging caddy. Not the lowest price we've seen (dropped to $110 in January), but still a good deal if you need one now. Deal price reflects in cart.Read the reviewThe Best Shower CaddyPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditBudget pickGTPlayer Ace Pro Gaming Chair$135 $160 Save $25Buy from Amazon What we like: Our budget gaming chair pick.

Most comfortable chair we tested at this price point. Other things to know: Narrow seat and fixed armrests accommodate a limited range of body types. One-year warranty. Pillow and footrest are noticeably cheap. Deal on white (which stained easily in testing). Not a huge discount; we had hoped for better pricing and color options.Read the reviewThe Best Gaming ChairPosted 1 day agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
