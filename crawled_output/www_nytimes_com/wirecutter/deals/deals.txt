Cloud-like formula feels light, luxurious, and mild on your hands and face. Sulfate-free soft foam fully removes dirt and grime and leaves your face feeling deeply clean — but not at all stripped. Just one pump emits a dollop that's just the right amount for face-washing. Other things to know: Pretty pricey. 5-ounce bottle. Contains 28 ingredients, making it harder to determine if one of them triggers a sensitivity or irritation. Mostly fragrance-free, with slight hints of coconut and medicine. Use promo code SUN20 to get the deal price and free shipping.Read the reviewThe 8 Best Facial CleansersPosted 6 hours agoCopy linkEditupcoming pickVichy Minéral 89 Booster Serum$28 $38 Save $10Buy from Amazon (2.5 ounces)What we like: An upcoming pick in our upcoming guide to French pharmacy skin care. A gel-like serum with water-binding hyaluronic acid that makes any moisturizer more effective. Testers liked how the formula slotted into their existing skin-care routines. Lightweight formula easily rubs into skin. Other things to know: If you have oily skin, you may be able to get away with using this gel in lieu of moisturizer — but folks with dryer complexions are better off pairing it with their regular cream or lotion. Deal for the 2.5-ounce size.Posted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickLego Money Tree 40648$18 $25 Save $7Buy from Amazon What we like: A Lego set staff pick we like for celebrating Lunar New Year. Builds a small potted tree festooned with 20 tiny tangerines. Also holds 10 coins and 14 red envelopes for even more fortune. Numbers six and eight are considered the luckiest in Chinese culture; we suggest affixing eight coins, 18 tangerines, and 12 envelopes, or another multiple. Other things to know: Lunar New Year has come and gone, but you can deck out your home with lucky decor any time (or save it for next year). 336 pieces. Meant for ages 9 and up, but senior staff writer Ellen Lee's 7-year-old was able to build it with some help.Read the reviewThis Lovely Lego Set Helps My Family Invite Good Luck for Lunar New YearPosted 7 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickIgloo IGLICEBSC26 Ice Maker$70 $95 Save $25Buy from Amazon (deal on aqua)What we like: Our top compact countertop ice maker pick. Makes nine bullet-shaped cubes in under 10 minutes. Lighter and easier to stow away than our classic top pick. Much easier to carry to the sink to drain and clean than others. Clear, straightforward controls. Self-cleaning. Other things to know: Slightly smaller reservoir requires more frequent refills. Like all bullet-ice makers, produces cloudy ice, which doesn't affect taste, but makes carbonated drinks go flat faster. Not very durable. One-year warranty. On sale in aqua.Read the reviewThe Best Countertop Ice MakerPosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickSiena Premier Hybrid Mattress (10-Inch, Queen)$419 $475 Save $56Buy from Amazon (queen)What we like: Our top supportive mattress pick for under $500. This medium-firm hybrid mattress won over testers of all sleep positions with its substantial, supportive feel and excellent edge support. Handles on the sides makes changing the sheets easier. Other things to know: May feel too firm for side sleepers or those who prefer to be cradled by their mattresses, or too bouncy for those who prefer to fully sink into a mattress. 180-night home trial period, the longest we’ve seen. 10-year limited warranty.Read the reviewThe Best Cheap Mattresses (Under $500)Posted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickAmazon Essentials Men's Long-Sleeve Crewneck Fleece Sweatshirt$10 $20 Save $10Buy from Amazon What we like: A sweatshirt staff pick we like to wear while working from home. Comfortable and well-fitted. Looks professional enough during video calls. Works in or out of the office. Other things to know: "Regular fit" has a closer fit through the body of the sweatshirt. Deal price available in many sizes and colors.Read the reviewOur Favorite Clothes to Wear While Working From HomePosted 8 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickKiehl’s Calendula Deep Cleansing Foaming Face Wash (7.8 Ounces)$29 $34 Save $5Buy from Woot (7.8-ounce bottle) Use promo code BEAUTYFIVE, free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: Our upgrade gel facial cleanser pick for oily or acne-prone skin. Cleanses efficiently, rinses easily, and makes skin feel soft, refreshed, and squeaky-clean. Won points among testers for its luxe plastic bottle and “lovely, clean, and natural” fragrance. Other things to know: Pretty expensive, even on sale. Pump requires effort, but a single push was enough for a thorough wash. Use promo code BEAUTYFIVE; ships free for Prime members.Read the reviewThe 8 Best Facial CleansersPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickHero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Original Patch (108-Count)$17 $35 Save $18Buy from Woot (108-count) Free shipping for Prime members, use promo code BEAUTYFIVEWhat we like: A quick pimple remedy from our drugstore beauty guide. Also recommended as a stocking stuffer gift. Round, translucent hydrocolloid stickers help heal zits and prevent below-the-surface pimples from erupting by absorbing fluid and protecting blemishes from bacteria. Other things to know: Also useful if you have trouble keeping your hands off a pimple. Not as fun as cuter, more sticker-y options out there, but very effective. Deal for 108 patches. Use code BEAUTYFIVE, free shipping for Prime members.Read the reviewThe Best Drugstore Makeup, Skin Care, and Other Beauty ProductsPosted 11 hours agoCopy linkEditUpgrade pickSamsung HW-Q990F Soundbar$928 $1800 Save $872Buy from Woot Free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: Our upgrade pick for the best soundbar. Simple to setup but nearly matches a full surround-sound speaker system. Multiple upward-firing speakers create a better sense of immersion. Subwoofer is compact and easy to hide. Other things to know: Comes with a compact subwoofer, separate rear speakers, four upward-firing Atmos speakers, and lots of inputs and audio-streaming options. Subwoofer could be a bit more powerful. Controllable through Samsung's SmartThings app, but front panel display on soundbar can be annoying to use. Ships free for Prime members.Read the reviewThe Best SoundbarPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditPick Accessory$50 Nintendo eGift Card$45 $50 Save $5Buy from Newegg Use promo code SSE992What we like: A nice-to-have gift card for owners of a Nintendo Switch, the most flexible pick in our game console guide. Essentially $5 of free money toward your next Nintendo eShop purchase. Keep for yourself or send to someone else as a gift. Wirecutter also has an ever expanding catalog of video game recommendations. Other things to know: Redeemable from a single Nintendo account through the Nintendo eShop on the Nintendo Switch, Wii U, and Nintendo 3DS family of systems. Recurring deal. Non-returnable and non-refundable. Email delivery. Use promo code SSE992.Read the reviewThe Best Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite AccessoriesPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditpick accessoryLevoit Vital 200S Air Purifier Replacement Filter$43 $48 Save $5Buy from Amazon (replacement filter only) What we like: A replacement filter for the Levoit Vital 200S air purifier pick. The Levoit Vital 200S excelled in our smoke tests, is highly efficient, and very quiet on lower, everyday fan settings. It offers four fan speeds, and the display can be darkened while the air purifier is still running. Other things to know: It's possible to save an additional 30% off with the on-page coupon by signing up for subscribe and save, but that discounted price isn't locked in for future deliveries.Read the reviewThe Best Air PurifierPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickPawsync Smart Pet Feeder$70 $85 Save $15Buy from Amazon What we like: A top pick in our guide to the best automatic pet feeders that had the best portion accuracy of all the models we tested. A scale underneath the stainless steel bowl allows it to track exactly how much food is actually dispensed. It can detect how much your pet eats, how fast they eat, and if any food is left over. Other things to know: The app isn’t as intuitive as that of our other top pick, and the machine’s longevity is not yet proven. It works on backup power but doesn’t log feedings in an outage. One-year warranty, which extends to two years if you register your feeder on Pawsync’s website.Read the reviewThe Best Automatic Pet FeederPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditMatches LowBudget pickBissell ProHeat 2X Revolution Pet Carpet Cleaner$160 $227 Save $67Buy from Amazon What we like: Our budget pick for the best carpet cleaner. Performed nearly as well as our top pick, beating all contenders on cleaning red wine. Far less expensive than our top pick and outperformed most carpet cleaners we tested. Can also be used as a spot cleaner. Other things to know: Lagged behind our top pick in cleaning chocolate ice cream and caramel syrup, and left carpet damper and less refreshed. Lighter weight, but looks and feels clunkier. Noisier than our top pick. Matches previous lowest price we've seen.Read the reviewThe Best Carpet CleanersPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickLaneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Pack of Two)$29 $35 Save $6Buy from Woot (pack of two) Use promo code BEAUTYFIVE, free shipping for Prime membersWhat we like: The prettiest, giftiest cult-fave lip balm staff pick from our Korean skin care guide. More fans among Wirecutter’s staff than any other item in the list. A yummy, luscious daytime gloss in a handful of irresistible, playful scents. Contains hydrating shea butter and antioxidant vitamin C. Other things to know: Its smooth, satiny texture strikes us as too sheer for mask status. A little goes a long way. Deal for two pots of the berry flavor, which gives lips a pretty pinkish cast. Not the lowest price we've ever seen, but better than the majority of sales. Use code BEAUTYFIVE; Prime members get free shipping.Read the reviewThe Best Korean Skin Care ProductsPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickCrest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Kit (22 Treatments)$30 $45 Save $15Buy from Amazon What we like: An at-home teeth-whitening solution used and loved by the Wirecutter staff. Low-tech, effective, and very affordable. No dentist visits required. The strips stay on but aren't particularly gooey or messy. Package comes with 22 treatments. Other things to know: Slower than professional treatments and the results you see will vary. The size of the strips are not customizable. Some Amazon reviewers have experienced increased sensitivity.Read the reviewWhy We Love Crest 3D WhitestripsPosted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditTop pickUSA Pan Square Cake Pan$15 $23 Save $8Buy from Amazon What we like: Our top square cake pan pick gave layers an even, golden color. Great price for such a heavy-duty, sturdy pan. The nonstick coating feels durable, and the edges and corners of our cakes came out clean and sharp. Comes with a limited lifetime warranty. Other things to know: 8 inches square. The corrugated sides help release cakes easily, they don’t mar the edges of the cake too much.Posted 12 hours agoCopy linkEditStaff pickRevlon ColorStay Lip Liner$7 $9 Save $2Buy from Ulta Use promo code PICKUP10, with store pickupWhat we like: A creamy lip liner we like in our drugstore beauty guide. Skinny, twist-up pencil offers excellent precision without skipping or dragging. Formula feels as luxurious as liners triple the price. Shades flatter a variety of skin tones. Other things to know: Tip may be small, but it didn't snap off in our tests. Available in 10 colors. Use code PICKUP10; store pickup required.Read the reviewThe Best Drugstore Makeup, Skin Care, and Other Beauty ProductsPosted 1 day agoCopy linkEditTop pickFeit Electric Enhance 60W Replacement Daylight A19 Dimmable LED Light Bulb (8-pack)$13 $16 Save $3Buy from Amazon (pack of eight)What we like: A larger eight-pack of our top daylight LED light bulb pick. Produces a white, cool light that’s suitable for kitchens or offices. Stood out from the competition by offering better color accuracy and more-even dimmability—no buzzing or flickering or plateauing at lower light levels. Other things to know: Five-year warranty, one of the best around. Energy Star rated. Deal is for an 8-pack of bulbs in 2700k soft white. Read the reviewThe Best LED Light BulbPosted 1 day agoCopy linkWirecutterWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.
