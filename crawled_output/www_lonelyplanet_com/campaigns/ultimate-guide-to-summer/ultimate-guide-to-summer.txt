The Ultimate Guide to Summer
Explore our summer destinationsItalySpainAnchoragePortugalGreeceGreat BritainChicagoBostonNew YorkItalySt. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City. leonori/ShutterstockCulture, cuisine and coastlines Most summer destinations either lean into big, flashy experiences or quiet moments and simple pleasures. Italy says, âWhy choose?â Long, sunny days are perfect for gazing at awe-inspiring ancient relics and architectural bombast, wandering through a rolling Chianti vineyard or sitting on a pastel balcony with an aperitivo or gelato in hand. And if youâre ready for a break from the Mediterranean sun, few places offer such achingly beautiful places indoors, between buildings and on the water. From romantic Venice to spectacular Sicily, with plenty of pasta in between, a summer trip to Italy will tick all your boxes.〝This is the ideal time to eat and drink by the sea, beneath a mountain or in a piazza; to drive, hike or cycle through impossibly pretty hills; or take your passeggiata through city streets packed with art, history and people-watching. Italy in summer is simply enchanting. 〞Daniel Bolger, Italy Destination EditorSassi Beach in Orta San Giulio. Claudia Gori for Lonely PlanetPeaks and valleys With rugged alpine mountains and fuming southern volcanoes, Italyâs landscape is a magnificent outdoor playground. Twenty-five national parks span terrain from sky-high rock spires in the Dolomites to the silent slopes of Le Marche. If youâre lucky, you might catch sight of a chamois, ibex, golden eagle, peregrine falcon or even a Marsican brown bear. If a spot by the water is more your speed, Italy has four seas and a coastline that stretches for 7600km (4700 miles). Whether youâre after an idyllic cove framed by plunging cliffs or a sandy strip lapped by azure waters, youâll find somewhere to suit your style.Â Summer in ItalyJune: 27Â°C / 81Â°F average daytime max (Rome); 4 days of rainfallJuly: 31Â°C / 88Â°F average daytime max (Rome); 3 days of rainfallAugust: 31Â°C / 88Â°F average daytime max (Rome); 3 days of rainfallLocal cheeses, charcuterie, and wines. Claudia Gori for Lonely PlanetWonders of the TableItaly is a country that lives to eat, where food is central to social life and culinary traditions are revered with heartfelt pride. Dishes are prepared with seasonal ingredients, and historic piazzas and seafront promenades provide a ready supply of memorable settings. In summer, Italian markets swell with mounds of fresh produce: plump eggplants, vivid red peppers, peaches, figs, watermelons and ripe lemons from the Amalfi Coast. For seafood lovers, this is a good time for cozze (mussels).AdvertisementMassenzio Basilica in Rome, during The Estate Romana. Franco S. Origlia/Getty ImagesEssential eventsEstate Romana: Rome puts on a summer calendar of events that turn the city into an outdoor stage. Music, dance, literature and film events are staged at some of the cityâs most evocative venues. JuneâOctoberPalio: Sienaâs Piazza del Campo sets the stage for this daredevil horse race. Centuries-old rituals surround the event, where costumed riders represent each of the cityâs medieval contrade (districts). JulyâAugustVenice Film Festival: One of the worldâs most prestigious cinematic events, this festival is held at the Lido and draws the international film glitterati with its red-carpet premieres and paparazzi glamor. AugustâSeptemberMake it happenYou could spend a lifetime of summers in Italy and never see half the things it has to offer. But in a week to 10 days, you can...Â Hit the highlights (10 days): Glide through the haunting canals of Venice, eat your fill in Bologna, revel in the Renaissance masterpieces of Florence, wander through the greatest hits of Rome, and live it up in Naples.Focus on the North (10 days): Start in style in Milan, then cut over to the palazzi (and balconies) of Mantua and Verona. Marvel at architectural wonders in Vicenza and Padua before hiking natural ones in the Dolomites.See the South Coast (7 days): Explore Naples and the ruins of Pompeii, then soak up the sun in Sorrento and catch a boat for Capri. Cap it off with Instagrammable Positano and the busy Amalfi Coast.Get a slice of Sicily (7 days): From the black lava streets of Catania to the ancient Greek temples of Agrigento, honey-hued towns set amid citrus and olive groves showcase the islandâs spectacular baroque beauty.Check the calendar2025 is a Jubilee year for the Vatican. That doesnât mean you have to avoid it, just be prepared for larger-than-usual congregations. In fact, depending on when youâre traveling, itâs worth checking Italyâs wider festivals program and religion calendar. Major cultural and business events can take over even large cities, while saintsâ days and big religious celebrations can lead to crowds and spikes in accommodation prices.AdvertisementAdvertisement The perfect beach read â beaches includedOur local travel experts reveal all you need to know to plan the trip of a lifetime, no matter what time of year you go.
