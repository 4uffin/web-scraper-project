Liability and Disclaimer
You must:
own all of the work you upload to the sites or have the permission from the owner of the content to upload it;
be able to grant Lonely Planet the rights under these Terms and Conditions (so, for example, you cannot grant us exclusive rights if you have already granted someone else exclusive rights); and
obtain the consent of the owner of any work incorporated into the content you upload on the sites;
because serious legal consequences can happen to you, Lonely Planet, and other parties if you do not (like legal action for infringement).
You indemnify Lonely Planet against all losses, costs and expenses directly incurred by Lonely Planet, in connection with a demand, allegation, action, proceeding or claim that you do not own all of your work, you are not able to grant Lonely Planet rights or you do not have the consent of an owner to incorporate their work into yours. Lonely Planet must take reasonable steps to mitigate its loss.
THE FOLLOWING APPLIES TO END USERS WHO LIVE OUTSIDE AUSTRALIA, THE UK AND THE EU:
