Overview Peru is a land of skyscraping peaks, vast jungle, and multilayered archaeology. From the worldâs tallest tropical mountain and highest navigable lake to rich biodiversity that ranks among the globeâs greatest, Peru offers both natural and cultural wonders. History seekers can explore Caral-Supe, the oldest-known civilization in the Americas, alongside ancient marvels like KuÃ©lap and ChavÃ­n de HuÃ¡ntar, while adventurers can trek rugged Andes trails, wander deserted ruins, or swing from a hammock deep in the Amazon. Youâll find endless Peru travel inspiration across its three distinct regions: the misty Pacific coast with surf beaches and prehistoric sites, the snow-dusted Andes crowned by Machu Picchu and the Cordillera Blanca, and the lush Amazon Basin stretching from Iquitos to the untouched wilderness of Pacaya-Samiria. Not sure where to start? Plan your adventure with our travel inspiration and tips covering top attractions, when to visit and expert advice.
