Overview Once an important trading center for caravans crossing the Sahara with gold, salt and enslaved people, Marrakesh has been welcoming visitors for centuries. Founded in 1062, the "Red City" is a tantalizing tangle of narrow streets with scintillating souqs full of treasures and truly impressive historical monuments with breathtaking plaster arabesques, intricate mosaics and magnificently carved cedarwood. Try world-renowned Moroccan cuisine, explore the buzzing Djemaa El Fna, stroll the streets of Ville Nouvelle to find heady sights and sounds that dazzle, frazzle and enchant, as they have done for almost a millennium. Not sure where to start? Plan your Marrakesh adventure with our travel inspiration and tips covering top attractions, when to visit and expert advice.
