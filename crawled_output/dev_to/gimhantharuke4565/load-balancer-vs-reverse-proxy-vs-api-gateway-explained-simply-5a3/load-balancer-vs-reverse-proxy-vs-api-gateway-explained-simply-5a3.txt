Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy vs API Gateway ‚Äî Explained Simply
#webdev
#devops
#systemdesign
#apigateway
When you‚Äôre working on scalable systems, three terms often pop up: Load Balancer, Reverse Proxy, and API Gateway.
At first, they might sound interchangeable since they all sit between the client and the backend servers. But in reality, each plays a unique role in modern system architecture.
Let‚Äôs break them down with simple explanations and comparisons.
üîπ 1. Load Balancer
Main Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
Why it matters: Ensures no single server gets overwhelmed, improves fault tolerance, and boosts availability.
How it works: It checks the health of servers and routes requests to the available ones.
Extra features: Can do session persistence, round-robin scheduling, and weighted distribution.
üìå Think of it like traffic police directing cars into different open lanes so that traffic flows smoothly.
üîπ 2. Reverse Proxy
Main Purpose: Acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers.
Why it matters: Hides the server‚Äôs identity and provides an extra security layer.
How it works: Accepts the request on behalf of the server, processes it (like SSL termination), and forwards it internally.
Extra features: Caching, compression, centralized logging, security filtering.
üìå Think of it as a receptionist at the front desk ‚Äî you never talk directly to the people inside; the receptionist filters and forwards your request.
üîπ 3. API Gateway
Main Purpose: A specialized proxy designed for microservices architectures.
Why it matters: Manages APIs and routes requests to the correct microservice.
How it works: Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, monitoring, and even API versioning.
Extra features: Request aggregation, transformations, policy enforcement.
üìå Think of it as a smart security gate that not only lets you in but also checks your ID, enforces rules, and guides you to the right department.

üîπ How They Work Together
These tools aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive. In many modern systems, you‚Äôll see them combined:
A Load Balancer distributes traffic to multiple nodes.
A Reverse Proxy adds security and caching in front of those nodes.
An API Gateway manages communication across microservices.
Together, they provide scalability, security, and manageability in distributed architectures.
üîπ Final Thoughts
If you‚Äôre building or maintaining scalable systems, it‚Äôs worth understanding the unique role of each:
Load Balancer = distributes traffic efficiently
Reverse Proxy = hides and protects backend servers
API Gateway = orchestrates APIs in microservices
