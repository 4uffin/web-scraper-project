Building a HIPAA-Compliant Chatbot with AWS Lambda & Bedrock
#aws

As a software engineer working in healthcare, I’ve seen first-hand how patients want instant answers but compliance makes everything tricky. We can’t just throw PHI (Protected Health Information) into ChatGPT and call it a day.
So I decided to build a HIPAA-friendly chatbot using AWS Lambda (serverless backend) and Amazon Bedrock (LLM service) — with data masking to keep sensitive info safe.
📌 This post walks you through:
Why chatbots in healthcare are challenging 🚑
How to design a compliant architecture 🔐
Code snippets for AWS Lambda + Bedrock ⚙️
Tips for keeping PHI secure 🛡️
🚨 The Challenge: AI + Healthcare = Risk
Chatbots are great for FAQs, triage, and scheduling.
But if you send raw PHI (like names, MRNs, diagnoses) to an LLM… that’s a compliance nightmare.
HIPAA requires minimum necessary access and strict controls.
🏗️ Architecture at a Glance
Flow:
Patient message → API Gateway
Lambda pre-processor → scrubs PHI (names, DOB, SSNs)
Bedrock LLM → processes the masked query
Lambda post-processor → reinserts placeholders if needed
Response → returned to patient securely
API Gateway → Lambda (mask PHI) → Bedrock → Lambda (restore placeholders) → Patient
⚙️ Step 1: Setting up AWS Lambda
A basic Python Lambda handler:
import boto3
import re
bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
def mask_phi(text):
# toy example: replace dates + names
text = re.sub(r'\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}', '[DATE]', text)
text = re.sub(r'\b(Alice|Bob|John)\b', '[NAME]', text)
return text
def lambda_handler(event, context):
user_input = event['queryStringParameters']['q']
masked_input = mask_phi(user_input)
response = bedrock.invoke_model(
modelId="anthropic.claude-v2",
contentType="application/json",
accept="application/json",
body=f'{{"prompt":"{masked_input}"}}'
)
return {
"statusCode": 200,
"body": response['body'].read().decode('utf-8')
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🤖 Step 2: Talking to Bedrock Safely
Always send masked input only.
Example:
Input:
John Smith has a fever since 09/21/2025. Should he see a doctor?
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Masked:
[NAME] has a fever since [DATE]. Should they see a doctor?
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🔐 Step 3: Post-Processing
If you need to restore placeholders (like Hello [NAME]), you can map them back safely from session state.
✅ Why This Matters
Patients get instant responses
Engineers stay HIPAA-compliant
Serverless (Lambda) keeps costs low
Bedrock provides enterprise-grade LLMs without exposing PHI
🚀 Next Steps
Add DynamoDB to store chat history (encrypted)
Plug in Cognito for authentication
Expand PHI scrubbing with Amazon Comprehend Medical
🙌 Closing Thoughts
As engineers, we often think "just ship the feature" — but in healthcare, privacy is the feature.
This project taught me that it’s possible to marry AI innovation with compliance if we design carefully.
