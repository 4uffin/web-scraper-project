Handle WebDAV as JSON: A One-File Self-Hosted API WebDAVJSON (PHP/Node.js)
#webdev
#php
#api
#javascript
https://github.com/GitHub30/WebDAVJSON
What is it?
WebDAVJSON lets you drop a single PHP or Node.js file on your server and immediately get a JSON API for file operations (list, upload, download, delete). It supports CORS, custom API key (Bearer) auth, and an extension allow-list, making it easy to call from front-ends or automation scripts.
Key features
CORS support
API key (Bearer) authentication (optional)
File listing in JSON
Upload (multipart/PUT), download, delete
Extension allow-list for basic safety
Single-file PHP/Node implementation
Endpoints (HTTP methods)
GET / — List files (JSON)
GET /?filename=abc.txt — Download
POST/PUT / — Upload (multipart or PUT)
POST/PUT /?filename=abc.txt — Binary upload to a specific name
DELETE /?filename=abc.txt — Delete
Quick setup
Node.js (Windows example)
winget install FiloSottile.mkcert Node.js --silent
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
node index.mjs
# Verify:
# fetch('https://localhost:8443/').then(r=>r.json())
# fetch('https://localhost:8443/?filename=foo.txt',{method:'PUT',body:'foobar'})
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
PHP (Linux example)
# Get the single file
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitHub30/WebDAVJSON/refs/heads/main/index.php
# Start with PHP’s built-in server (choose any port)
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Usage (cURL recipes)
List files (JSON)
curl http://localhost:8000/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Partial match search (q)
curl "http://localhost:8000/?q=report"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Download
curl -O "http://localhost:8000/?filename=abc.txt"
# Save as attachment with original name
curl -OJ "http://localhost:8000/?download&filename=abc.txt"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Upload (multipart/form-data)
curl -F "file=@abc.txt" http://localhost:8000/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Upload (PUT, binary)
curl -X PUT --data-binary @abc.txt "http://localhost:8000/?filename=abc.txt"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Delete
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/?filename=abc.txt"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Authentication (optional)
If you set $api_key (PHP) or the equivalent in the Node file, the API will require the header Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>.
Example:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" http://localhost:8000/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Extension allow-list
Example of commonly allowed extensions:
txt, jpg, png, webp, heic, gif, pdf, docx, xlsx, zip, mp4, gz
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Tightening this list is recommended when exposing the API.
When it’s handy
You want a minimal self-hosted storage API callable from a front-end
You need a quick drop-zone for CI/CD artifacts
You prefer a no/low-code backend you can spin up in seconds
You’re standing up a temporary sharing server with basic guards (CORS + key)
Notes & best practices
Serve over HTTPS and enable an API key
Keep the exposure surface minimal and restrict the allowed extensions
Set correct permissions on the writable directory
If usage grows, consider rate limiting and audit logging

Wrap-up
WebDAVJSON is a “smallest-viable API” you can deploy in minutes. Despite its tiny footprint, it covers practical needs like CORS, API keys, and extension filtering. When you need a lightweight, self-hosted file API, this is a great first choice.
