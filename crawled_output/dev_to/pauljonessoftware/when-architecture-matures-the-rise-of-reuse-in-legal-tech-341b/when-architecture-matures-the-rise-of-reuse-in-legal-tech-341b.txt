When Architecture Matures: The Rise of Reuse in Legal Tech
#legaltech
#programming
In the early stages of any software platform, the codebase is often a battlefield‚Äîfeatures are shipped fast, edge cases are patched on the fly, and architectural purity takes a backseat to survival. But then something shifts. Quietly, unmistakably, the system begins to speak for itself.
That‚Äôs where we are now.
Our recent work has revealed a pattern‚Äînot just in the code, but in the philosophy behind it. When design patterns, inheritance, generics, and reflection all take center stage, it‚Äôs more than a technical milestone. It‚Äôs a signal that the platform is maturing. Each principle promotes reuse in its own right. Together, they‚Äôre a force multiplier.
üìê Design Patterns as Narrative Structure
We‚Äôve leaned into the Template Method pattern to govern how legal deadlines are processed. The base class defines the flow:
Identify the trigger event
Apply the base limitation
Layer in discovery rules, tolling, and repose
Record an auditable result
Derived classes override only what‚Äôs necessary‚Äîjust like statutory exceptions modifying common law. It‚Äôs not just elegant; it‚Äôs jurisprudential.
üß¨ Inheritance as Legal DNA
Our base utility now serves as the ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù of the system. It encodes the default rules for:
Limitation periods
Discovery logic
Minor tolling
Statute of repose
Each derived utility‚Äîwhether for personal injury, medical malpractice, or motor vehicle claims‚Äîinherits this foundation and introduces overrides only where the law demands nuance. It‚Äôs inheritance with discernment.
üß∞ Generics for Repeatability
We‚Äôve begun abstracting shared behaviors into generic utilities‚Äîhydrating rule sets, generating audit trails, and managing extension logic.
This isn‚Äôt just DRY code. It‚Äôs a framework for onboarding new practice areas with surgical precision‚Äîand every new rule automatically inherits the same audit-ready scaffolding.
ü™û Reflection for Extensibility
Reflection allows us to instantiate calculators dynamically based on metadata and rule types.
No fragile switch statements.
No hard-coded logic.
Just clean, data-driven instantiation that respects exclusivity while enabling scale.
üöÄ The Force Multiplier
These principles aren‚Äôt just academic. They‚Äôve transformed how we build:
Lean codebase: Duplication is gone. Shared logic lives in one place.
Reduced bugs: Fixes in the base class propagate everywhere.
Fast extensibility: Adding a new calculator is now a seven-step, repeatable process.
Audit by design: Every deadline decision leaves a transparent, explainable trail.
üß≠ Closing Thought
This refactor wasn‚Äôt just about code. It was about alignment. By treating our base utility as ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù and our overrides as ‚Äústatutory exceptions,‚Äù we‚Äôve created a system that respects the law‚Äôs structure and delivers maintainable, audit-defensible software.
If you‚Äôre a developer who sees architecture as narrative, and reuse as stewardship, we‚Äôre building something you‚Äôll want to be part of.
