Which Approach Should You Choose?
Final Thoughts
1. Introduction
In my previous article on Django security, I covered how to harden a Django project: from secure settings and middleware, to deployment practices and even request throttling with Django REST Framework (DRF). DRF includes built-in throttling classes that help prevent clients from making excessive requests in a short period. These can mitigate throttling attacks. That article, however, mostly focused on traditional web app security.
For many projects today, Django also powers APIs — whether for SPAs, mobile apps, or external integrations. Securing those APIs brings its own set of challenges and requires a careful look at authentication methods. In this article, we’ll break down the main approaches to API authentication in Django, the third-party packages that support them, and the trade-offs between usability and security.
2. Session Authentication + CSRF
What is it?
This is Django’s traditional authentication flow: user logs in, server creates a session, and the browser receives a session cookie. APIs can use this too via DRF’s SessionAuthentication, which enforces CSRF tokens.
Pros:
Battle-tested and audited.
Built-in CSRF protection when using cookies.
Easy to invalidate sessions on logout.
Cons:
Not ideal for non-browser clients (mobile apps, third-party APIs).
Requires shared session storage if you scale horizontally.
Where throttling fits:
Even with CSRF, an attacker could still attempt brute-force logins or credential stuffing. DRF’s throttling mechanisms (AnonRateThrottle, UserRateThrottle) help prevent abuse, especially on login endpoints.
3. Simple Token Authentication
What is it?
DRF provides a straightforward TokenAuthentication system: user logs in, gets a token string, and sends it with each request (Authorization: Token <token>).
Pros:
Simple to implement and use.
Tokens can be revoked manually by deleting them.
Cons:
Tokens don’t expire by default.
If a token leaks, it can be used indefinitely.
Where throttling fits:
APIs using token auth should always throttle login or token issuance endpoints to mitigate brute force attacks. Without throttling, a leaked token or weak password could be exploited quickly.
4. API Key Authentication (via django-rest-framework-api-key)
What is it?
django-rest-framework-api-key is a package that allows you to issue, manage, and revoke API keys. These keys are hashed in the database for security and can be scoped to different services or use cases. Clients authenticate by including the key in the request header.
Pros:
Easy to generate and revoke keys.
Good fit for machine-to-machine communication (internal services, IoT devices, backend integrations).
Keys are stored securely (hashed).
Cons:
API keys don’t inherently represent a user identity.
Lack fine-grained permissions without extra logic.
If a key leaks, it can be reused until revoked.
Where throttling fits:
Since API keys often bypass user authentication, endpoints secured with them should be rate-limited and restricted by IP or scope when possible. Always use HTTPS to prevent key interception.
5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Access + Refresh Tokens
What is it?
JWTs are stateless, signed tokens. Typically, short-lived access tokens are paired with longer-lived refresh tokens. Popular implementation: Simple JWT.
Pros:
Stateless validation, great for microservices.
Short-lived tokens reduce exposure if compromised.
Refresh token rotation possible.
Cons:
Revocation is tricky without a blacklist.
Refresh token theft is a major risk.
Where throttling fits:
Because JWTs are often used in high-traffic APIs, throttling refresh endpoints is critical. Without it, attackers could attempt token replay or brute force stolen refresh tokens.
6. Django-Rest-Knox
What is it?
Knox improves DRF’s token system by supporting per-device tokens, automatic expiry, and better logout handling.
Pros:
Token expiry built-in.
Revocation works on a per-device basis.
More secure than DRF’s simple token system.
Cons:
Tokens stored server-side, so less “stateless” than JWT.
Requires shared storage in distributed systems.
Where throttling fits:
Knox already expires tokens, but you should throttle token creation endpoints. Otherwise, an attacker could flood the system with token requests, creating operational or security issues.
7. Helper Libraries: allauth, dj-rest-auth, and Djoser
django-allauth – Handles registration, login, social auth, and email verification. Typically paired with sessions, but can integrate with APIs.
dj-rest-auth – REST endpoints for login, logout, password management, and registration. Can work with both token and JWT.
Djoser – REST implementation of Django’s auth system. Provides out-of-the-box endpoints for registration, login, and password reset with support for token or JWT.
Where throttling fits:
Registration, login, and password reset endpoints are common abuse targets. DRF’s throttling (ScopedRateThrottle) allows you to set stricter limits just for these sensitive endpoints.
8. OAuth2 and Django OAuth Toolkit
For more advanced use cases (delegated access, external identity providers), Django OAuth Toolkit provides OAuth2 / OIDC support. It’s heavier than JWT or Knox but useful for enterprise scenarios.
Where throttling fits:
OAuth token endpoints (/token, /authorize) should always be throttled, as they are prime brute-force targets.

10. Security Best Practices
Regardless of approach:
Throttle sensitive endpoints: login, password reset, token/refresh endpoints.
Use HTTPS everywhere.
Short-lived tokens with rotation (for JWT).
HttpOnly + Secure cookies (for session or cookie-stored JWT).
Blacklist or revoke tokens when passwords change.
Audit logs: track failed logins, unusual token usage.
11. Which Approach Should You Choose?
Web apps you fully control → Session authentication with CSRF is simplest and safest.
Machine-to-machine or internal service APIs → API Key authentication (via django-rest-framework-api-key) is simple and effective, especially when full user authentication is unnecessary. Ensure keys are combined with HTTPS, throttling, and optional IP restrictions.
Mobile or third-party clients → JWT with refresh tokens (via Simple JWT + dj-rest-auth or Djoser).
Need per-device revocation, but not JWT complexity → Knox.
Enterprise with external identity providers → OAuth2 (Django OAuth Toolkit).
Always combine with DRF throttling on critical endpoints to reduce brute force and abuse risk.
12. Final Thoughts
API authentication in Django is not one-size-fits-all. The right choice depends on your clients, scalability needs, and threat model. Whether you choose sessions, tokens, JWT, Knox, or OAuth2, the most important thing is to configure it securely — and don’t forget that throttling is as much a part of API security as authentication itself.
