Everything React: From Basics to Advanced - Introduction to the Series

Part 1: The Absolute Basics - Your Roadmap to Getting Started
3
React Fundamentals: What It Is, Why We Use It, and How to Get Started

Your First React Component: JSX, Components, and the "Hello, World" Program

Passing Data with Props: Building Parent-Child Components
Hi everyone! My name is Maria Mendonca, and I've been a ReactJS Developer for three years. Over that time, I've faced my share of challenges and celebrated my share of victories. Now, I'm excited to share everything I've learned with you. I'm starting this series to be your personal guide, helping you navigate the world of React and overcome the same hurdles I once did.
Why I'm Creating This Tutorial Series
There are countless React tutorials out there, but many can feel overwhelming or leave you stuck on a specific problem. I'm creating this series for two main reasons: to simplify complex concepts and to help people who feel stuck. I'll be sharing not just the "how" but also the "why," including the common pitfalls I encountered and how I overcame them. My hope is that by sharing my personal journey, you'll feel less alone in your struggles and more empowered to push through them.

Who Will Benefit from This Series?
This series is for two types of people: students who are just starting their React journey and developers who want to refresh their knowledge. While knowing the basics of JavaScript is a bonus, it's not a requirement—we'll be starting from scratch. As we go, I encourage you to ask questions in the comments, and I'll do my best to help you solve them.
How We'll Learn Together
This series is structured into six parts, with each part containing 7-8 articles. We'll progress from the basics to advanced concepts, and along the way, I'll give you "food for thought"—small projects to help you practice what you've learned. By the end of each part, you'll feel more confident in your skills. We'll also have recap articles dedicated to solving common pitfalls, so you'll be well-equipped to handle real-world challenges. By the end of the entire series, you'll have a solid foundation in React and the confidence to build your own projects.
Stay Tuned!
The journey begins this Friday! Make sure to follow me here so you don't miss any updates. I'll be posting new articles every Tuesday at 12:00 PM IST and Friday at 6:00 PM IST. We'll also be revisiting previous concepts, answering frequently asked questions, and even sharing bonus articles on tech trends. Our first article, "The Basics, Part 1: Roadmap," is coming this Friday. I can't wait to start this journey with you!
Let's Connect!
