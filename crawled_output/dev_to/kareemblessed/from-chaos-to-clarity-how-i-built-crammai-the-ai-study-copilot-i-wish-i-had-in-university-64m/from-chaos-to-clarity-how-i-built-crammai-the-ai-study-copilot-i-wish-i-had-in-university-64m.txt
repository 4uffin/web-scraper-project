The Spark Behind CrammAI
Back in university, my classmates probably thought I never slept 😅. I was always neck-deep in coding projects 💻, tinkering with the latest AI tools 🤖, and still somehow crushing my exams 🎯.
But here’s the truth: my bottleneck wasn’t understanding the concepts 🧠. I could pick those up fast.
The real struggle was wading through endless PDFs 📑, lecture notes 📝, and convoluted study guides 📘 just to find the critical info.
I kept thinking: “_If only I had an AI that could automate this process. Something that could ingest all my materials and tell me exactly what to focus on.”
Fast forward a few years later — I finally built it. 🎉
Meet CrammAI — the study co-pilot I wish I had in uni 🧑‍🎓. Born out of my obsession with automation ⚡, it transforms pre-exam chaos into a clear, tactical, and automated study plan 🚀.
Here’s how I built this personal study automation engine.
🛠️ The Tech Stack: My Automation Pipeline
To bring this to life, I needed a stack that was fast, modern, and could seamlessly integrate powerful AI capabilities. The goal was to build an automated content analysis and generation pipeline.
Frontend: React with TypeScript for a dynamic and type-safe user interface.
AI Engine: The Google Gemini API (@google/genai) is the core of the automation. It handles document analysis, topic prioritization, and content generation.
Styling: Good old-fashioned CSS. Clean, simple, and effective.
Step 1: 🕹️ The User Input: Setting the Automation Parameters
Every good automation workflow starts with clear inputs. For CrammAI, the user defines the parameters by choosing a "study mode" based on their timeline. This was crucial because how you study with a week to spare is completely different from how you study the night before.
🧘 Cruise Control (1+ week): Comprehensive, deep-dive automation.
🚀 Turbo Mode (~2 days): Strategic automation focusing on high-impact topics.
**⚡ Zoom Mode (Due tonight): **A tactical strike plan. The AI automates the process of finding only the absolute must-know concepts for a last-minute cram session.
This initial choice acts as the primary instruction for the AI automation pipeline that follows.
code
Tsx
// Simplified React component for mode selection
const HomePage = ({ onSelectMode }) => (
<div className="mode-selection">
{/* The "Zoom Mode" card for last-minute crammers like me! */}
<div className="mode-card zoom" onClick={() => onSelectMode('zoom')}>
<div className="mode-icon">⚡</div>
<h2 className="mode-title">Zoom Mode</h2>
<p className="mode-description">Due tonight. Maximum focus, maximum efficiency.</p>
</div>
{/* Other modes follow the same pattern... */}
</div>
);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: 📤 Automating File Ingestion and Preparation
My AI co-pilot needed to read my study materials. The Gemini API can process various file types, but it requires them in a specific format (base64 encoded strings). To make this seamless, I wrote a helper function to automate the conversion.
This function takes a standard File object from the browser, reads it, and automatically converts it into the JSON structure the Gemini API expects.
Tsx
/**
* An automated utility to convert a browser File object
* into the Gemini API's expected Part format.
*/
import { Part } from "@google/genai";
const fileToGenerativePart = (file: File): Promise<Part> => {
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsDataURL(file);
reader.onload = () => {
// The result is a Data URL, e.g., "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..."
// We automate splitting and extracting the necessary base64 data.
const base64Data = (reader.result as string).split(',')[1];
resolve({
inlineData: {
mimeType: file.type,
data: base64Data
}
});
};
reader.onerror = error => reject(error);
});
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: 🧠 The Core Automation: AI-Powered Analysis and Planning
This is where the real magic happens. The app sends the user's files and the selected study mode to the Gemini API. The key to successful automation here is enforcing a strict output format.
You can’t build a reliable automation pipeline if you're just hoping the AI gives you good data. The Gemini API’s responseSchema feature is a lifesaver. It forces the AI to return clean, predictable JSON every single time.
This completely automates the data-parsing step and makes the app incredibly robust.
Tsx
// Inside the main plan generation function
import { GoogleGenAI, Type } from "@google/genai";
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
// 1. Get user-defined parameters (mode) and prepare files
const prompt = getPromptForMode(mode);
const fileParts = await Promise.all(uploadedFiles.map(fileToGenerativePart));
// 2. Define the automation's output contract (the JSON schema)
const responseSchema = {
type: Type.OBJECT,
properties: {
study_these: {
type: Type.ARRAY,
description: "A list of the most critical topics to study.",
items: { /*... topic, reason, key_points ...*/ }
}
}
};
// 3. Trigger the AI automation pipeline
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
contents: [prompt, ...fileParts],
config: {
responseMimeType: 'application/json',
responseSchema: responseSchema, // Enforce the contract!
},
});
// 4. The result is clean, structured data, ready for the UI. No messy parsing needed.
const result = JSON.parse(response.text);
setAnalysisResult(result); %}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: ⚡ Automating Active Recall: Flashcards & AI Grading
A study plan is just the start 📅. To really learn, you need active recall 💡. CrammAI automates this by generating “Flashcard Sprints” for each topic 🃏.
But the coolest automation? The grading ✅.
When a user submits an answer, I don’t just do a basic string comparison. Instead, I send both the user’s answer and the correct answer to the Gemini API 🌐, asking it to grade for conceptual correctness. This makes the system feel way more intelligent — almost human 🤖.
And yes, this is fully automated with a response schema 📐 to guarantee a simple true/false plus clear feedback 📝.
Tsx
// The prompt for the automated AI grader
const prompt = `You are an AI grader. Be lenient with phrasing but strict on the core concept.
**Question:** ${currentCard.question}
**Correct Answer:** ${currentCard.answer}
**User's Answer:** ${userAnswer}
Is the user's answer substantially correct?`;
// The schema for a simple, automated response
const evaluationSchema = {
type: Type.OBJECT,
properties: {
is_correct: { type: Type.BOOLEAN },
feedback: { type: Type.STRING }
}
};
// The API call uses this prompt and schema to automate the grading process.
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({ /* ... */ });
const result = JSON.parse(response.text); // e.g., { is_correct: true, feedback: "Spot on!" }
