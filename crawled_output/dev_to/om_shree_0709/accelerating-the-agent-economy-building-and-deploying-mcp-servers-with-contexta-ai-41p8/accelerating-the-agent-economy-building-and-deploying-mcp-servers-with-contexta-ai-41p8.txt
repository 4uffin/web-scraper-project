Accelerating the Agent Economy: Building and Deploying MCP Servers with Contexta AI

The Model Context Protocol (MCP), a foundational component of the emerging agent economy, enables seamless, standardized communication between large language model (LLM) agents and external services. While the protocol's promise is significant, facilitating secure, dynamic, and discoverable tool usage its implementation has historically been complex. The process involves manual setup of SDKs, server code, authentication, and logging, often forcing developers to juggle disparate services for development, hosting, and testing. Contexta AI, a platform designed to simplify this entire workflow, positions itself as the "Firebase for MCP servers," providing a unified, one-stop solution to streamline the creation and management of these agent-facing services1.
The MCP Development Challenge
Before platforms like Contexta AI, building a production-ready MCP server was a multi-step, fragmented process. Developers were required to have a deep understanding of the protocol's SDKs and to manually write server code. Beyond the initial implementation, critical production concerns such as authentication, authorization, tracing, and logging had to be individually wired up. This fragmentation reduced developer efficiency and created a high barrier to entry. Furthermore, a developer would need to set up a separate client to test their server, leading to a disconnected development lifecycle where creation, hosting, and testing were all handled in different environments. The challenge was compounded when attempting to combine tools from multiple MCP servers into a single, cohesive endpoint a complex task that often required significant custom development.
Contexta AI directly addresses these pain points by offering an integrated platform that abstracts the underlying complexities. It consolidates the development pipeline, providing built-in solutions for server creation, testing, deployment, and observability. The platform's core value proposition lies in its ability to enable developers to build and deploy production-ready MCP servers quickly, allowing them to focus on the business logic of their applications rather than the infrastructural plumbing.
Key Features and Workflows
Contexta AI offers three primary methods for creating an MCP server, each catering to a different developer workflow:
Template-based creation: The platform provides a directory of curated, pre-built templates for common services like Notion and Gmail. A user can select a template, configure their authentication (e.g., OAuth for Notion), and deploy a fully functional MCP server in minutes.
Import from GitHub: For developers with existing MCP server code, Contexta AI allows direct import from a GitHub repository. The platform identifies the necessary configurations and environment variables from a context_config file in the repository's root, automating the deployment process.
OpenAPI specification import: A particularly powerful feature is the ability to convert any API with an OpenAPI specification into an MCP server. The platform automatically converts API endpoints into MCP tools, and users can edit tool descriptions to be more understandable and effective for LLMs. This feature is crucial for developers looking to expose existing, proprietary APIs to the agent economy without writing new code.
The platform also solves the challenge of tool composition with its custom MCP server feature. Developers can select specific tools from multiple deployed servers on their account and combine them into a single, new endpoint. This enables complex, multi-service workflows for example, a server that fetches customer data from a sales platform and syncs it to a CRM.
Behind the Scenes / How It Works
At its core, Contexta AI functions as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for MCP. It provides the necessary backend infrastructure for server hosting and management, similar to how Firebase abstracts mobile backend development. The platform handles the orchestration of the following components for each deployed server:
Server Code and SDK: When a user deploys a template or imports code, Contexta AI manages the underlying server-side implementation and SDK integration.
Deployment and Hosting: Servers are deployed to a scalable, secure, and managed environment, handling everything from containerization to resource allocation based on demand.
Authentication: The platform fetches and securely stores authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) needed for the server to interact with third-party services.
Observability: A built-in logging and tracing feature monitors all tool calls, including success rates, failure rates, and input/output arguments. This provides granular visibility into how agents are interacting with the server, which is essential for debugging and performance optimization. An example trace for a HubSpot tool call would show the hubspot.batchCreateObject tool, the session ID, and the input arguments and response payload, allowing for a detailed post-mortem analysis of the execution1.
This integrated approach means the platform not only facilitates the initial development but also provides the ongoing operational support required for production-grade agent services.
My Thoughts
Contexta AI represents a crucial step in the maturation of the agent economy. By abstracting the complexities of MCP server development, it lowers the barrier to entry for developers and businesses to create agentic interfaces for their services. The ability to automatically generate MCP servers from OpenAPI specifications is particularly forward-thinking, as it allows companies to instantly expose their vast ecosystems of APIs to an agentic future.
However, a key limitation today is the general immaturity of the MCP ecosystem. As noted by Contexta AI's founders, many current implementations are essentially just API wrappers. The true potential of MCP lies in its more advanced primitives, which have yet to be fully explored. The protocol's design goes beyond simple tool calling, supporting concepts like tool orchestration via prompts and "sampling," which involves interleaving LLM calls with tool executions. As the platform and the broader community continue to evolve, we should see an increasing number of servers that leverage these advanced capabilities to create truly autonomous and intelligent services. The platform's roadmap, which includes features like agent creation within servers and integrating prompts, suggests a future where the servers themselves become more "agentic," blurring the line between a tool and a fully autonomous agent.
Acknowledgements
Many thanks to ContextaAI founders Rupesh Raj (CEO) and Akshay (Co-founder and CTO) from Contexta AI for their insightful work on simplifying MCP server development and deployment through their platform, and to the broader MCP and agent economy community for driving innovation and collaboration in this space.
