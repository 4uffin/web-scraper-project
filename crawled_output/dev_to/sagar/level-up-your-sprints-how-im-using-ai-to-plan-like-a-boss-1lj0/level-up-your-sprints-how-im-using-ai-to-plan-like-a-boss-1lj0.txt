Level Up Your Sprints: How I'm Using AI to Plan Like a Boss

Hey everyone,
So, I've been on a mission lately to seriously up my planning game. For the past few sprints, I've been experimenting with ways to get better estimations and smoother feature releases. This week, the focus was on planning a pretty big feature: a whole new cart and checkout experience for our product. Sounds fun, right?
My initial approach was the usual: gather requirements, understand the "why" behind the implementation, and dive into the designs. I figured having a solid grasp of all this would automatically lead to better planning. But, as I started actually writing the plan, I realized how tedious and inefficient it felt. That's when the "aha!" moment hit: why not let AI take a swing at this?
Enter Gemini Pro and NotebookLLM. I started by feeding all my gathered requirements and documentation into Gemini Pro to create a detailed product requirements doc. It did a surprisingly good job! Next, I wanted to identify any missing requirements or gaps in the design. I kept asking questions in the same chat, but it felt like the context was getting lost. You know how those long chat-based conversations can be!
That's when I realized NotebookLLM could be a game-changer. I loaded it up with all the knowledge I had gathered from various sources and asked it to generate a full feature delivery plan, identify potential blockers, and even create detailed Jira stories. And wow, the output was impressive!
From there, it was all about creating Jira tickets and walking the team through the plan to ensure everyone was aligned and we could get to a more accurate final estimation. We were able to pinpoint cross-team dependencies and identify tasks where there was still some uncertainty. Now, I'm simply following the plan.
One of the biggest advantages I've discovered is that having a solid plan frees up my mental space. I can focus on execution without constantly having to figure out the next task. Plus, I can easily review my progress each week and update the plan as needed.
Honestly, the benefits of working with a plan (and with AI to create it!) are huge. That's all for this week – happy planning!
