Missing in Modern C++: Event Synchronization Primitive — with Working Examples
#cpp
#opensource
#programming
#multiplatform
If you’ve ever struggled with mutexes, predicates, and spurious wakeups in C++ multithreaded code, you know how much time can be lost managing synchronization instead of solving real problems. Here’s a simpler, more predictable approach.
std::condition_variable is powerful, but it’s verbose, fragile, and full of boilerplate.
Check the official example in cppreference:
mutexes, predicates, loops, unlock/relock dance — and still you’re exposed to spurious wakeups (proof). Boost and Qt inherit the same quirks.
For developers seeking a straightforward signaling primitive, Windows long offered Event objects, with auto-reset and manual-reset semantics to directly signal threads.
The Areg Framework brings the same concept to cross-platform C++: SynchEvent, a lightweight, developer-friendly multithreading primitive that behaves like Windows Events and works well even in embedded systems.
Why SynchEvent?
Think of it as a direct C++ event primitive:
✅ No spurious wakeups
✅ No predicate gymnastics
✅ No unlock/relock pitfalls
Just signal and wait — with both auto-reset and manual-reset semantics, like Windows Events.
Key Features
SynchEvent is modeled after Windows Events, but works on Linux and Windows alike:
Auto-reset → wakes exactly one thread, then resets automatically
Manual-reset → wakes all waiters until reset
Persistent state → no lost signals (signal-before-wait still wakes)
Straightforward API → lock(), unlock(), setEvent(), resetEvent()
No extra flags, mutexes, or predicate loops required.
Auto-reset vs Manual-reset (visual)
Auto-reset (wake ONE, then reset):
[Thread A waits] ---+
[Thread B waits] ---+--> Signal --> wakes one thread --> reset
Manual-reset (wake ALL until reset):
[Thread A waits] ---+
[Thread B waits] ---+--> Signal --> wakes all threads --> stays signaled

Code Comparison
With std::condition_variable
Example from cppreference
std::mutex m;
std::condition_variable cv;
std::string data;
bool ready = false;
bool processed = false;
void worker() {
std::unique_lock lk(m);
cv.wait(lk, []{ return ready; });
data += " processed";
processed = true;
lk.unlock();
cv.notify_one();
}
int main() {
data = "Example";
std::thread worker(worker);
{ std::lock_guard lk(m); ready = true; }
cv.notify_one();
{ std::unique_lock lk(m); cv.wait(lk, []{ return processed; }); }
worker.join();
std::cout << data << '\n';
}

Exit fullscreen mode
With SynchEvent (Areg SDK)
Full example here
#include "areg/base/SynchObjects.hpp"
SynchEvent gEvent(false, true); // signaled, auto-reset
std::string data;
void workerThread() {
gEvent.lock();
// wait (no spurious wakeups, no predicate loops)
data += " processed";
gEvent.setEvent();
// signal done
}
int main() {
data = "Example";
std::thread worker(workerThread);
gEvent.setEvent();
// signal worker
gEvent.lock();
// wait for completion
worker.join();
std::cout << data << '\n';
}

👉 Notice the difference: no flags, no spurious wakeups, no lock dance.
Another example demonstrates waiting on multiple mixed synchronization objects like SynchEvent and Mutex. Clone the repo and try it yourself to see the simplicity firsthand.

Where SynchEvent Shines
A classic use case for a synchronization event is a Message Queue:
Queue has a manual-reset event
As long as messages exist → event stays signaled
When last message is consumed → event resets
With condition_variable, this requires extra locks, predicates, and loop checks.
With SynchEvent, it’s a single signal/wait mechanism.
Condition variables are fine for state predicates, but for pure synchronization, SynchEvent is the sharper tool.
Final Takeaway
If you’re tired of condition-variable spaghetti, try SynchEvent from Areg Framework: cross-platform, lightweight, and modeled after Windows Events.
👉 Star the Areg SDK repo on GitHub, try the examples, and experience how effortless C++ multithreading can be!

WIndows has a native primitive for event, and it is indeed really handy. So I am curious and would have to see what the posix one looks like. But it might make my move pipelines even more efficient because I do the conditional variable / lock thing for that, though I only signal on empty or when becoming less than full, and keep separate conditions for each side of the pipeline. Another kind of primitive I have found useful and emulate from go is the waitgroup.
