New Framework Ripple? What about Others?
#webdev

That's funny how people who already has media traction can sell basically anything - unfinished, unpolished project that repeats Vuejs with React style.
It's not something bad actually, but the way it's done is just killing me slow. Ripple is not unique, on my way of creating actually new framework - Proton, I've seen so many frameworks like Ripple, so I don't really understand how people are attracted to THIS, while not attracted to anything else that really changing it.
Yeah, I guess that's just marketing, now you have to sell a open source project. Imagine how many projects die that could've changed the industry because they didn't have enough of media resource? - Probably a lot.
Why Ripple even got attention? It uses JSX, while actually not, because it uses its own .ripple files, which simply means entirely new syntax parser. It parasitize on what's loved by community and includes by what's hated, but still sold.
Maybe it's giving something better than reactive $ that Vuejs has already been doing forever?
A new syntax of mapping an array? Wait! Angular has already doing that.
You can declare components with component keyword - OMG, WTF, so you're saying I'm so idiot that I need a special keyword to declare a component?
JavaScript directly in the html? Mmm, is this some kind of punishment? I think there is a reason why developer community is up to {{foo}} syntax...
Maybe a nice tree-shaking? SSR speed? Small bundle size? Customization? Anything actually new? Well It's basically a mix of several frameworks without any change, and I'm afraid it inherits the worst qualities of all of them rather than vice versa.
So what, people are dumb? - No, people are trustful, they trust in people they are already subscribed to, so they eat what they give, even if it's undercooked meat.
Why youtubers advertise this? - Because they are dumb... well I mean they just ride on a hype wave :(
What then?
Can we just appreciate some open source projects that really require attention?
Back the builders, not the buzz, spotlight open source that actually make a move.
Stop applauding noise, promote projects that solve real problems.
Discover, star and support under-the-radar projects.

Why'd you (software engineers) have to go and make things (software development) so complicated...

The situation here is the same as with any business/startup: the founder's credibility (yet well-deserved) gives a product so much valuable traction at the early stages (even without being supplemented with any reasonably-useful deliverables). It's hard to get it otherwise these days ‚Äî there are too many frameworks (tools, solutions, etc.) around. The mass stupidity is fed with short attention span which doesn't allow to get into more details (the Ripple's codebase is pretty weird tbh), and with influencer-driven media turning their FOMO into mutually-competing overly-hysterical content driving the hype.
All in all, don't let this status quo discourage you. Persevere in delivering quality. Maybe someday, the real things will start to surface in people's minds. Maybe not. Then it's failure. But it was worth it.

The community really needs to start looking past what youtubers say and promote.
If a framework collects thousands of stars in a matter of weeks, it just means a few microphone guys with little engineering knowledge have been praising it because they've been paid to do so.
Does that warrant any "star" on Github? Maybe stars should be abolished altogether, as they only create cognitive bias (e.g.: social validation) in engineers who should act rationally, instead.
Do we want a world driven by the cognitively manipulated?

Would be cool if we had a stars gain curve displayed in github for each repo.

one like star-history.com? Some people do use it...
I'd still go for no stars, or otherwise more metrics than just one. There are so many emojis that could be used to rate various aspects of a product...
