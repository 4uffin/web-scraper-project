ShadCN Rich Text Editor with Lexical + Lexkit
#typescript
#tooling
#showdev
#react
So, in my last post I was ranting about my struggles with building rich text editorsâ€¦
Every time I touched Lexical, I loved the core idea butâ€¦ the DX (developer experience) feltâ€¦ meh.
I wanted something where I could just plug in extensions, have full type-safety, and not fight the damn thing every two lines of code.
And guess what? I finally did it ðŸŽ‰
I built LexKit â€” my own little framework on top of Lexical.
DX-friendly, modular, and honestly the editor system I always wished existed.
Here's a quick preview of the shadcn template that I've made.
ðŸ‘‰ Shadcn based editor ( See the demo )
Lexkit RTE made on Lexical
Lexkit Peerdeps on Lexical,
To add this editor into your own React project:
Install lexkit
npm install @lexkit/editor
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
and Lexical Deps
npm install lexical @lexical/react @lexical/html @lexical/markdown @lexical/list @lexical/rich-text @lexical/selection @lexical/utils
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then, check out the docs here to plug in the Shadcn template:
Shadcn Based Template Docs | Source Code on Github
Thatâ€™s it. No magic. Just install, copy, paste, and boom â†’ youâ€™ve got a Shadcn flavored RTE.
Qucik Editor Example to see how things work
Hereâ€™s a minimal editor setup using LexKit.
Literally like 10 lines of code:
import { createEditorSystem, richTextExtension, boldExtension, italicExtension } from "@lexkit/editor"
const extensions = [
richTextExtension,
boldExtension,
italicExtension,
] as const
const { Provider } = createEditorSystem<typeof extensions>()
export default function MyEditor() {
return (
<Provider extensions={extensions}>
<div className="p-4 border rounded">
{/* RichText extension renders automatically */}
</div>
</Provider>
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Thatâ€™s all. You can start typing right away.
Why I built Lexkit?
Because DX matters to me a lot.
I was sick of guessing types, fighting plugins, and patching random examples from GitHub gists.
With LexKit:
you get typed commands & state queries out of the box
extensions are composable and headless (like lego blocks ðŸ§±)
itâ€™s React-first, so no weird wrappers
and yesâ€¦ it actually works in production.
Whatâ€™s Next?
I'm working to add more extensions, more templates and demos and more docs.
Your supports will keep this project going. It can be a comment or Github Star, or suggesting features and reporting bugs, or even a small donation or sponsorship ðŸ™ˆ
ðŸ‘‰ Lexkit Docs
ðŸ‘‰ GitHub
Thatâ€™s it. Hope this helps you if youâ€™ve been lost in RTE hell like I was.
And if you try it, let me know what breaks ðŸ˜…
