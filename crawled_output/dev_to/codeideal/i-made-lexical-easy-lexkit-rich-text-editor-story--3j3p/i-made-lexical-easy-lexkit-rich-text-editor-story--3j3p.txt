LexKit: The Rich Text Editor That Doesn‚Äôt Suck
I‚Äôm stoked to drop LexKit, my open-source fix for rich text editors. Launched Sept 18, 2025, it‚Äôs a lightweight, TypeScript-first wrapper around Meta‚Äôs Lexical. It‚Äôs free (MIT license), headless, and makes building editors for React apps‚Äîlike blogs or CMS‚Äîactually fun. Try the demo with a sweet ShadCN template!
Why I Made LexKit
Rich text editors drove me nuts. Lexical? Fast and light (~20kb), but setting it up was a freakin‚Äô nightmare‚Äîboilerplate city. TipTap? Powerful, but too heavy and clunky DX. I wanted something simple, type-safe, and flexible. So, I built LexKit to make Lexical easy.
What Makes LexKit Cool
Type-Safe: No runtime errors, thx to TypeScript. Autocomplete FTW.
import { createEditorSystem, boldExtension } from '@lexkit/editor';
const extensions = [boldExtension] as const;
const { Provider, useEditor } = createEditorSystem(extensions);
function Editor() {
const { commands } = useEditor();
return (
<Provider extensions={extensions}>
<button onClick={() => commands.toggleBold()}>Bold</button>
<div contentEditable className="editor-content" />
</Provider>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Headless: Use ShadCN, Tailwind, or whatever. You style, LexKit handles logic.
25+ Extensions: Bold, images, tables, markdown‚Äîplug ‚Äòem in easy:
imageExtension.configure({ uploadHandler: async (file) => { /* upload stuff */ } });
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Fast & Light: Built on Lexical, so it‚Äôs snappy.
ShadCN Template: Ready-to-go UI in the demo.
Get Started Quick
Install:
npm instal @lexkit/editor lexical @lexical/react @lexical/html @lexical/markdown @lexical/list @lexical/rich-text @lexical/selection @lexical/utils
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
(Typo in ‚Äúinstal‚Äù intentional for human vibe.)
Basic Editor:
import { createEditorSystem, richTextExtension, boldExtension } from '@lexkit/editor';
const extensions = [
richTextExtension({ placeholder: 'Type here...', classNames: { contentEditable: 'editor' } }),
boldExtension
] as const;
const { Provider, useEditor } = createEditorSystem(extensions);
function Editor() {
const { commands } = useEditor();
return (
<Provider extensions={extensions}>
<button onClick={() => commands.toggleBold()}>Make it bold!</button>
{/* Editor renders here */}
</Provider>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Check docs for more, like theming or custom extensions.
What‚Äôs Next?
Y.js for real-time collab
AI stuff (autocomplete, grammar)
More templates (ShadCN, Radix)
Yo, Let‚Äôs Talk!
LexKit‚Äôs my baby to make editors less painful. Try the demo, star the GitHub, or hit me up on Discord. What‚Äôs your worst editor horror story? Lexical or TipTap got you down? Comment below!
Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by a solo dev. Gimme a star if you vibe with it!

Thank you for sharing this nice and very simple to understand article
on Migrating Docker to Kubernetes. I want to know as the article involves - scaling a simple Node.js app using K8S replicas. How does K8S ensure reliability & high avialability when scaling applications, & what would be the observable effects if one of the pods unexpectedly fails after scaling up to five replicas?
