AWS MediaTailor : Server Side Ad Insertion (SSAI)
#aws
#ssai
#advertisement
#videojs
What is SSAI?
Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI) is a technology where ads are stitched directly into the video stream on the server before it reaches the viewer’s device. With SSAI, the video player receives a single, continuous stream that includes both the main content and the ads, making the transitions between them seamless.
Why ?
Seamless playback experience: No buffering or jarring transitions between content and ads.
Bypasses ad blockers: Since ads are part of the main stream, it’s harder for ad blockers to filter them out.
Consistent performance across devices: Works smoothly on various platforms and devices without heavy client-side logic.
Better measurement & analytics: Offers precise tracking through server-side and client-side beaconing.
Scalability: Easier to manage ad workflows on the server rather than on individual client apps.
This article covers how to integrate MediaTailor SSAI with your video player and covers all the frontend aspects.
For this, I will be using example of video.js.
A glimpse about video.js :-
Video.js is an open source javascript based video player which is used by approx 800,000 websites.
✨ Bonus: Includes a custom plugin that facilitates ad markers, an ad counter with a countdown timer, and beaconing.
For more insights into backend integration, check out this article, which dives deep into the server aspects of SSAI."
📘 Steps to Integrate SSAI Workflow
Here are the steps required to set up AWS MediaTailor SSAI with your video player. :-
1. Session URL formation :
Now the first thing is session url which is basically the post api call which is initiated from the player to the stitching service (MediaTailor) which passes it further to the ads server (Eg. FreeWheel).
You typically generate the session URL by replacing certain parts of the manifest URL:
Replace ‘/dash/’
with ‘/session/’ for MPD assets (DASH).
Replace ‘/master/’
with ‘/session/’ for HLS assets.
Example final session URL:-
https://domain.example..com/v1/session/aesdnsjdsk/Renditions_asset/20250805/1754403862031_sample_HD_TVE_SAMPLE_ASSET_07172025_7830k_mp4_CUSTOM_CODEC_TS_DRM_DASH_DRM/dash/stream.mpd
You can also check with your backend team on how to create the session link as it can be done differently on the basis of CDN and other mapping. There is also the possibility of not doing this on the player all together and having it done by the server using the video id and then the server is responsible to just send you manifest and tracking url.
2. POST Request to Get Manifest and Tracking URL
Once you have the session url , you now need to send the url as a POST request with the necessary key:value pairs required by Ad decision server.
Note that user-agent is an essential header which needs to be passed in order to ensure that the ad decision server stitches the ad seamlessly.
For a web browser, we don’t need to explicitly send as it is managed by the browser.
3. Parsing the Response.
Once you post the session url , you will get the following response :-
Example response:
{
manifestUrl:"/v1/dash/a2769ff6f508fb0f68aca8782209ab59ae7a5db0/sample/Renditions/20250805/1754403862031_sample_mp4_CUSTOM_CODEC_TS_DRM_DASH_DRM/dash/stream.mpd?aws.sessionId=dz2d6359-4302-4fb2-a3c4-7cefa9468d42",
trackingUrl:"/v1/tracking/a2769ff6f508fb5f68aca8782209ab59ae7a5db0/samoke/eb7d6e59-4302-4fb2-a3c4-7cefa9468d32"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In the response, you will get the paths of tracking url and manifest url.
To construct the full URLs, prepend the same domain you used for the POST request.
Tracking URL → Contains ad details and beacons
Manifest URL → Contains stitched content with ads
Pass the manifestURL in videojs to run the stitched content.
Example: Play the stitched asset.
player.src( {src: ‘manifestUrl’ , type :
‘application/x-mpegURL“} )
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Once set, the player will seamlessly play content + ads as a single stream.
This will allow the stitched asset to play seamlessly.
Now, let's move forward with showing the ad-markers on the seekbar
and managing advertisement beacons.
Tracking URL is the source of truth for managing anything related to the ads in case of aws media tailor.
4. Working with Tracking URL
Ensure that the updatedManifest URL is loaded into the player before calling the tracking URL.
This is an important step because if you call the tracking URL first without loading the updated manifest url with sessionId, you will end up getting an empty response from the stitching service (aws-mediatailor).
Once the asset is loaded, you can simply call the tracking url as shown below:
Eg:
player.one(‘loadeddata’, async()=>{
// initiate get request for tracking url.
getTrackingData();
})
async function getTrackingData(){
const res =
await fetch(trackingUrl);
const data = await res.json();
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Initiate a get request to retrieve all the advertisement related data.
You will get a JSON based response as a result.
The ‘avails’ key is an array of objects which consists of all the ad pods present in the stitched asset.
Now here, the response might not include ads in all the pods and you can get an empty array for some cases.
You can now mark the ad pods on the video.js player's seekbar based on this data.
Since each ad pod has the ‘startTimeInSeconds‘ key , we can mark that ad pod on the seekbar.
You can also use this plugin which basically does the job with many other features as well.

5. Beaconing (Client-Side Tracking)
Now here comes the client side beaconing.
In AWS MediaTailor, beacons are small tracking signals sent to an ad server to report on viewer ad engagement, indicating milestones like the start or completion of an ad. AWS MediaTailor supports both server-side (where MediaTailor sends the beacons) and client-side (where the player sends the beacons) tracking methods to provide granular metrics for ad performance and impression measurement.
Lets discuss about the client side beacon handling :-
The ad pod contains an ‘ads’ key which is an
array of objects.
Inside each object, we have the ‘trackingEvents’ key which consists of all the beacons related to that particular ad.
Now , each trackingEvent has the ‘startTimeInSeconds’ which denotes when this beacon event should be triggered. It also has the ‘beaconUrls’ key which consists of the url for that beacon.
For a particular advertisement, we are supposed to send a get request exactly as per the 'startTimeInSeconds'.
Now, in video.js or any other web based player we can make use of player.on(‘timeupdate’,cb) event in order to facilitate this logic.
⚠️Caution: Since timeupdate fires 4-5 times/second. It is important to handle the logic carefully.
You can also this plugin. It handles the beacon logic as well as it provides other basic features for ssai integration.
Final Thoughts
That’s it!
You now have a fully functional AWS MediaTailor SSAI integration with:
Session URL creation
Manifest loading
Tracking data handling
Ad markers on the seek bar
Client-side beacon tracking
