Deploying Tideman Election App on AWS EC2 with Docker
#aws
#cloud
#docker
#linux
I recently took my Tideman app from my laptop to the cloud, and getting it live on AWS EC2 with Docker turned out to be simpler than I expected.
Setting Up my EC2 Instance
First, I launched an AWS EC2 instance with Ubuntu as the operating system. I chose a small instance (free tier eligible) since my app isn’t too heavy.
After launching, I configured the instance’s Security Group to allow the right ports:
Port 22 (SSH) so I could connect to the server’s terminal.
Port 80 (HTTP) so the web app would be accessible in a browser.
Afterwards, I installed Docker and cloned my code to the EC2 instance.
# On the EC2 instance
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io git
# (Optional) clone your repo and move into it
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Writing a Multi-Stage Dockerfile
Now for the main part: containerizing the app with Docker.
I created a file named Dockerfile in the project directory. Because my app has two components (C++ and Python), I used a multi-stage Docker build to keep the final image lean. Here’s how I set it up:
Stage 1: Build the C++ Program
In the first stage, I used a Docker image with a C++ compiler to compile the algorithm:
# Stage 1: Compile C++ code
FROM gcc:latest AS builder
# Use GCC compiler image
WORKDIR /app
# Copy in the C++ source code and compile it
COPY my_algorithm.cpp /app/my_algorithm.cpp
RUN g++ my_algorithm.cpp -o my_algorithm
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This stage grabs the official GCC image, copies my C++ source file into it, and runs g++ to compile the code into an executable (my_algorithm).
Stage 2: Set Up Python + Flask
For the second stage, I wanted a lightweight Python environment to run Flask and the compiled binary. I chose a slim Python image:
# Stage 2: Run Flask app with Gunicorn
FROM python:3.10-slim AS final
# Use a small Python image
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the compiled C++ binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/my_algorithm /app/my_algorithm
# Copy the Flask app code and any other files
COPY app.py /app/app.py
COPY index.html /app/index.html
COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
# Install Flask (and Gunicorn) via requirements
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Expose port 5000 and start the app using Gunicorn
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What’s happening in Stage 2:
We switch to a Python 3 slim image (much smaller than a full Ubuntu or GCC image).
Copy the compiled C++ binary from stage 1 into this new image. This way, the Python container can use the C++ program without needing a compiler.
Copy over the Flask app (app.py), the index.html, and a requirements.txt listing Python dependencies.
Install dependencies: I included Flask (and Gunicorn for the server) in requirements.txt, so pip install -r requirements.txt pulls those into the container.
Finally, set the container to listen on port 5000 and define the startup command: here I use Gunicorn to run the Flask app.
The multi-stage approach means our final image (stage 2) does not include all the bulky build tools from stage 1.
We only carry over the compiled binary and needed files. This makes the final Docker image smaller and cleaner, which is great for efficiency and security.
Building and Running the Docker Container
With the Dockerfile written, I proceeded to build the image on the EC2 instance:
sudo docker build -t myflaskcpp .
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Next, I ran the container. This is where the port configuration is important. My Flask app (via Gunicorn) is set to run on port 5000 inside the container. But I want people to access it through the standard HTTP port 80 on the EC2 instance. So I used a port mapping:
sudo docker run -d -p 80:5000 myflaskcpp
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Here, -p 80:5000 maps port 80 on the host (the EC2 instance) to port 5000 inside the container. Now, any request hitting the EC2’s public IP on port 80 will be forwarded to the Flask app in the container. I ran the container in detached mode (-d) so it runs in the background.
Note: Make sure you opened port 80 in the EC2 security group. Otherwise, you won’t be able to reach the app from your browser.
Why Use Gunicorn instead of Flask’s Dev Server?
You might wonder why I’m using Gunicorn in the Dockerfile, rather than just running the development server:
python app.py
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The reason is that Flask’s built-in server (the one you get with app.run()) is meant for development only. It’s single-threaded by default and not optimized for multiple users or production stability.
Gunicorn, on the other hand, is a production-ready WSGI server. It can handle multiple requests at the same time by running several worker processes. This means if one user is making a slow request, other users can still be served in parallel. Gunicorn is also well-tested for deployment, making your app more robust under real-world traffic. In short, using Gunicorn ensures our Flask app will be able to handle more than one person at a time and won’t crash at the first sign of stress.
Wrapping Up
Now grab the EC2 instance’s public IP and check if it works.
And that’s it! We have managed to get a C++ algorithm and a Flask web interface deployed on AWS using Docker. As someone new to combining these technologies, it felt great to see it running live.
Key Takeaways
Use EC2 security groups to open the ports you need (SSH and HTTP in this case).
Docker multi-stage builds can mix languages (compile in one stage, run in another) to keep things efficient.
Map your container’s internal ports to the server’s ports so the world can reach your app.
Gunicorn is your friend for serving Flask in production.
Happy deploying! 🚀

tideman
Tideman Electoral System
Tideman’s Ranked Pairs method (developed by Nicolaus Tideman) is a ranked-choice voting algorithm that selects a single winner by constructing a directed graph of pairwise victories and locking in the strongest preferences while avoiding cycles.
This repository contains an object-oriented, benchmarked, file-driven C++17 implementation, wrapped with a Flask API and a minimal HTML front end for interactive demos.
Features
CSV input with support for thousands to millions of ballots
High-resolution benchmarking using <chrono> for performance profiling
Object-oriented design (TidemanElection, VoteParser, Benchmark)
Robust error handling (bad input, duplicates, file issues)
Efficient in practice: runs on millions of ballots with ≤9 candidates in milliseconds
Web service wrapper: C++ executable exposed via Flask API + HTML page
Sample Input (CSV Ballots)
Example with 3 candidates (Alice, Bob, Charlie):
VoterID,Alice,Bob,Charlie
1,1,2,3
2,2,1,3
3,1,3,2
... up to N rows
Each…
