Best Coding Practices for .NET Core API Development
Building robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs in .NET Core requires following proven coding practices. Here are 12 essential practices for creating high-quality .NET Core APIs.
1. Use Layered Architecture
Separate your code into distinct layers:
Controllers handle requests/responses
Services contain business logic
Repositories handle data access
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
private readonly IOrderService _orderService;
public OrdersController(IOrderService orderService)
{
_orderService = orderService;
}
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetOrders()
{
var orders = await _orderService.GetOrdersAsync();
return Ok(orders);
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Follow Naming Conventions
Use consistent naming throughout your codebase:
PascalCase for classes and methods
camelCase for variables and parameters
Descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
3. Apply Dependency Injection
Leverage .NET Core's built-in DI container:
builder.Services.AddScoped<IOrderService, OrderService>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IOrderRepository, OrderRepository>();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Use Async Programming
Always use async/await for I/O operations:
public async Task<Order> CreateOrderAsync(CreateOrderRequest request)
{
var order = await _repository.CreateAsync(request.ToEntity());
return order;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Handle Exceptions Globally
Implement middleware for centralized exception handling:
app.UseExceptionHandler(errorApp =>
{
errorApp.Run(async context =>
{
context.Response.StatusCode = 500;
await context.Response.WriteAsync("An error occurred.");
});
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
6. Validate Inputs
Use model validation attributes:
public class CreateOrderRequest
{
[Required]
[StringLength(100)]
public string CustomerName { get; set; }
[Required]
[EmailAddress]
public string Email { get; set; }
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
7. Secure Your API
Implement authentication and authorization:
Use JWT or OAuth2
Enforce HTTPS
Apply rate limiting
Validate all inputs
8. Version Your API
Use API versioning to manage changes:
[ApiVersion("1.0")]
[Route("api/v{version:apiVersion}/orders")]
public class OrdersController : ControllerBase
{
// Implementation
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
9. Write Tests
Cover your code with unit and integration tests:
[Fact]
public async Task GetOrders_ReturnsOrderList()
{
// Arrange, Act, Assert
var result = await _service.GetOrdersAsync();
Assert.NotNull(result);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
10. Implement Logging
Use structured logging for better observability:
_logger.LogInformation("Order {OrderId} created", order.Id);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
11. Optimize Performance
Use response caching
Implement pagination
Optimize database queries
Use background services for heavy operations
12. Document Your API
Use Swagger for API documentation:
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Conclusion
These practices will help you build APIs that are maintainable, secure, and performant. Start implementing them incrementally in your projects for the best results.
