Information
Subforems are New and Experimental
Subforems are a new feature that allows communities to create focused spaces within the larger Forem ecosystem.
These networks are designed to empower our community to build intentional community around what they care about and the
ways they awant to express their interest. Some subforems will be run communally, and others will be run by you.
