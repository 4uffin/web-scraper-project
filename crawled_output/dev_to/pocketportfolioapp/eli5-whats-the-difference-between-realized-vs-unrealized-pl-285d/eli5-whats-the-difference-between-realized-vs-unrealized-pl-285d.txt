ELI5: What‚Äôs the difference between *realized* vs *unrealized* P/L?
#explainlikeimfive

I‚Äôm building an open-source portfolio dashboard and keep tripping over how to explain P/L in a way that actually clicks for newcomers.
ELI5 ask:
How would you explain the difference between realized profit/loss and unrealized profit/loss to a 10-year-old?
Constraints (to keep it simple):
Use one short analogy (max 2‚Äì3 sentences).
Bonus if you can show a tiny numeric example (e.g., ‚Äúbought at 10, now 12‚Ä¶‚Äù).
A couple of things that confuse people we talk to:
‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt sell, why does the number go up/down?‚Äù
‚ÄúFees & FX: do they belong in realized, unrealized, or both?‚Äù
Drop your best analogy below ‚Äî I‚Äôll pin the clearest one and credit you in our in-app help text üôå
