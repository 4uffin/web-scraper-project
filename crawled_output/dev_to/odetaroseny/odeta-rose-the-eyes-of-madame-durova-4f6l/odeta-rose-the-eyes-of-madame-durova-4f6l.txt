Odeta Rose & The Eyes of Madame Durova

In a crumbling village nestled in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania, the locals whispered one name with dread: Madame Durova.
Her house sat at the edge of the forest, leaning like it had grown tired of standing over the years. No one remembered when she moved in—only that she'd always been there. They said her eyes were mismatched: one a pale, icy blue, the other a deep, bleeding red. Children dared each other to knock on her door. None ever did.
In October of 1993, a young anthropology student named Levente Nagy arrived from Cluj-Napoca. He was writing a thesis on Eastern European folklore and craved authenticity. When he asked the villagers about Durova, their faces turned to stone.
“She is not story,” warned old Baba Ileana, spitting over her shoulder. “She is curse.”
Levente, ever the skeptic, dismissed their warnings as superstition. “All myths have roots in truth,” he said. “Even if just a seed.”
Ignoring every caution, he trekked to the house on the hill.
The forest seemed to recoil as he approached. Branches bent away, and birds grew silent. He knocked once.
Silence.
Twice.
Still.
Then the door creaked open—just a sliver. A cold draft curled out, smelling faintly of lavender and something older… something dead.
“Poftim, intră,” said a voice, soft and slithering.
He stepped inside.
Madame Durova stood before a fireplace that emitted no heat. Her back was to him, but she spoke as though she'd been expecting him.
“You seek stories,” she said. “But some stories do not like to be found.”
“I believe stories want to be told,” Levente replied, pulling out his notebook.
She turned.
Her eyes were as described: one glacial, the other the color of blood-soaked garnet. Her face was unnaturally smooth, ageless, yet ancient.
“Sit,” she said.
He obeyed, his limbs betraying him. Something in the air made his skin crawl.
“I have a story for you,” she said, voice barely above a whisper. “It is about a boy who believed knowledge was armor. He thought the world could not touch him.”
She stepped closer. “But there are truths that do not want to be known.”
Levente tried to smile, uneasy. “I’m not afraid of truth.”
She grinned. “Then you’ll enjoy this one.”
She spoke for hours. A tale of a mirror buried beneath the floorboards of a monastery. A mirror that did not reflect the world, but another. In it, one could see their deepest fear… and once seen, the fear would crawl out.
The boy in the tale, of course, could not resist. He broke the boards. Looked.
“And what did he see?” Levente asked.
Madame Durova’s voice dropped to a whisper.
“He saw himself… but the eyes were not his.”
Levente shivered.
“And then?” he asked.
She looked at him.
“He never looked away.”
When Levente awoke, it was morning. He was lying outside the house, notebook beside him, every page covered in ink but no words.
The villagers said nothing when he returned. They only stared at his eyes.
One blue.
One red.
He went back to Cluj-Napoca. Tried to resume his life. But at night, the dreams came. Always the same.
A mirror.
A version of himself on the other side, smiling wider than humanly possible.
And slowly, with each night, that version grew closer.
He stopped sleeping.
Two months later, Levente returned to the village, thinner, wilder. He begged Baba Ileana for help.
“You looked,” she whispered, crossing herself.
He nodded, trembling. “I have to fix it.”
She told him the mirror was not in the story. It was real. Buried beneath the ruins of Mănăstirea Neagră, the Black Monastery. Forgotten by time.
But not by Durova.
With a lantern and shovel, Levente hiked into the woods that night, wind howling like a warning. The ruins were as described—charred stone and ash.
He dug where the altar once stood.
The earth was loose. Fresh.
He hit wood.
He opened it.
The mirror shimmered with a glassy, sickly sheen. It reflected not his surroundings—but that other world again. Foggy, wet, and wrong. A hand pressed against the other side. His hand.
But it didn’t move as he did.
It smiled.
Then it pushed.
The glass rippled like water.
Levente screamed and swung the shovel.
Too late.
Three days later, a traveler found a man walking the roads barefoot, muttering to himself in Hungarian, Romanian, and a language unknown. His eyes were wrong.
One blue.
One red.
He said his name was Levente Nagy.
But his voice wasn’t quite right.
And he never blinked.
