Hello Devs, Python remains one of the most in-demand programming languages across industries --- whether you're automating workflows, analyzing data, building web apps, or diving into AI and machine learning.
But learning Python effectively depends a lot on who teaches you or what kind of course you choose.
Over the years, I've taken dozens of Python courses on Udemy, and I've learned that some instructors consistently stand out for their teaching clarity, project-based approach, and regular course updates.
In this article, I'll introduce you to five of the best Udemy courses and their instructors to learn Python from in 2025.
Whether you're just getting started or looking to master advanced topics, these instructors and their courses have been tailored for every level.
Another key thing I want to share with you is that when you learn from multiple instructors, you learn better. Every instructor has their own way of explaining things, and for one reason or another, when you learn from multiple folks, eventually things fall in place.
That's why I prefer to join multiple courses and learn from more than one instructor, more often than not
I Tried 20+ Python Courses: These 5 Udemy Instructors Are Actually Worth It
Without any further ado, here are the top 5 teachers you can join to learn Python programming online in 2025. Most of these teachers offer Udemy courses, which you can join for an affordable price.
1. Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2025
Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code with Python is one of the most popular and engaging Python courses on Udemy.

Her pacing is perfect for both beginners and intermediate developers.
What I love most is how her teaching style encourages you to build things every single day, which keeps motivation high and improves retention.
