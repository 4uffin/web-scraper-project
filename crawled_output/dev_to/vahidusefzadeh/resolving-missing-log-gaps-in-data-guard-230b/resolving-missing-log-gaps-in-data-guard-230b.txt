Resolving Missing Log Gaps in Data Guard
#oracle
#database
#linux
#rman
Fixing a standby gap has been possible since Oracle 10g using incremental backup, but it had to be done completely manually. This process required determining the SCN number, taking an incremental backup from the primary database, transferring the backup files to the standby server, and so on.
Starting from Oracle 12cR1, some improvements were introduced, and part of this process became automated. However, it still required going through several manual steps:
SQL>startup force mount
RMAN> RECOVER DATABASE FROM SERVICE prim NOREDO ;
RMAN> RESTORE STANDBY CONTROLFILE FROM SERVICE prim;
SQL>startup force;
ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE;
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In Oracle 18c, further improvements were made. Now, with just one command, all the above steps are performed automatically:
RMAN> RECOVER STANDBY DATABASE FROM SERVICE tns_fal_server;
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Below, we will simulate this scenario.
Step 1: Checking the current status of standby vs. primary
On primary (prim):
SQL> select max(sequence#),thread# from v$archived_log group by thread#;
MAX(SEQUENCE#)
THREAD#
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“ â€”â€”â€”-
128
1
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
On standby (stb):
SQL> select max(sequence#),thread#,applied from gv$archived_log group by thread#,applied order by thread#;
MAX(SEQUENCE#)
THREAD# APPLIED
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“ â€”â€”â€”- â€”â€”â€”
128
1 YES
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
As shown, the standby is in sync with the primary.
Step 2: Simulating a gap
We shut down the standby:
SQL> shutdown abort
ORACLE instance shut down.
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then, on the primary, we generate and immediately delete an archived log:
alter system switch logfile;
alter system switch logfile;
[oracle@hkm6 ~]$ rm -rf /18c/arch/1_129_972120046.dbf
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
When the standby is started again, it will wait for archive log 129, which was deleted:
SQL> startup
Database opened.
SQL> alter database recover managed standby database;
PR00 (PID:23943): Media Recovery Waiting for T-1.S-129
PR00 (PID:23943): Fetching gap from T-1.S-129 to T-1.S-129
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
At this stage, the standby is intentionally placed in a gap situation.
Step 3: Resolving the gap with Oracle 18c
Cancel managed recovery on standby:
SQL>
alter database recover managed standby database cancel;
Database altered.
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Run the new Oracle 18c command in RMAN:
RMAN> recover standby database from service prim;
Starting recover at 26-APR-18
using target database control file instead of recovery catalog

3. Restart managed recovery:
SQL>
alter database recover managed standby database;

Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Verifying the result
Now, the standby has applied archive log 130, proving the gap is resolved:
SQL> select max(sequence#),thread#,applied from gv$archived_log where RESETLOGS_ID=972120046 group by thread#,applied order by thread#;
MAX(SEQUENCE#)
THREAD# APPLIED
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€“ â€”â€”â€”- â€”â€”â€”
