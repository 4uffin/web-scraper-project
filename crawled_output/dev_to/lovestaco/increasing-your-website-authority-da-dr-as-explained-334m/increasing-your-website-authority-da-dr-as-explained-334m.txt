Increasing Your Website Authority (DA, DR & AS Explained)

Hello, I'm Maneshwar. I'm working on FreeDevTools online currently building **one place for all dev tools, cheat codes, and TLDRs* ‚Äî a free, open-source hub where developers can quickly find and use tools without any hassle of searching all over the internet.
Website authority is a concept in SEO that reflects a website‚Äôs ability to rank high in search engine results pages (SERPs).
It‚Äôs not an official Google metric, but SEO professionals often use it as a benchmark for measuring a domain‚Äôs ranking potential.
üëâ Current DA: 19
üëâ Target DA: 50
If you‚Äôre wondering what these numbers mean and how to improve them, let‚Äôs break it down.
What Is Website Authority?
Website authority is essentially an SEO score that predicts how competitive your website is in organic search compared to others.
Different SEO platforms calculate it differently:
Moz: Domain Authority (DA)
Semrush: Authority Score (AS)
Ahrefs: Domain Rating (DR)
Comparing the Metrics
Moz: Domain Authority (DA)
Developed by Moz
Score range: 1‚Äì100
Factors considered:
Number of linking root domains
Total number of backlinks
Authority of linking sites
Use Case: Great for tracking your link-building progress.
Semrush: Authority Score (AS)
Developed by Semrush
Combines backlink quality, organic traffic, and spam indicators
Factors considered:
Link quantity + quality
Monthly estimated organic traffic
Signs of link manipulation
> Best when you want a broader authority view (links + traffic).
Ahrefs: Domain Rating (DR)
Developed by Ahrefs
Focuses heavily on backlinks
Factors considered:
Number of unique referring domains
DR of linking domains
Number of outbound links from those domains
> Perfect for competitive backlink research.
Why High DA Doesn‚Äôt Always Mean High Rankings
Example keyword: ‚Äúhow to choose a wetsuit for surfing.‚Äù
Cleanlinesurf.com ranks #1 with a DA 28 and 462 referring domains.
Quiksilver.com.au ranks #2 with a higher DA, but fewer referring domains.
Backlink quality and relevance often matter more than raw DA.
Strategies to Increase Website Authority
1. Create Linkable Assets
The best backlinks are earned with content worth linking to.
Examples of linkable assets:
Industry statistics pages
‚ÄúTop Tools‚Äù lists (e.g., Top AI Tools 2025)
GitHub Awesome Lists
Free interactive tools or calculators
üìö Resources:
Reverse Outreach
Examples of Linkable Assets
2. Focus on Content Marketing
High-quality content not only ranks but also attracts backlinks naturally.
How to get started:
Do Keyword Research (use Ahrefs, Moz, or Semrush).
Publish listicles and comparisons (e.g., Swagger Alternatives).
Optimize with tools like SurferSEO or Frase.
3. Build Backlinks with Outreach
Broken Link Building
Find dead links on other websites ‚Üí suggest your content as a replacement.
Tool: Ahrefs Broken Link Checker
Guide: Broken Link Building (Backlinko)
Claim Unlinked Mentions
Sometimes your brand is mentioned without a link.
Tool: Google Alerts
Alternative: Mention.com
4. Keep Your Backlink Profile Healthy
Not all backlinks are good. Some can actually harm your site.
Bad backlinks include:
Spammy or irrelevant sites
Link farms / Private Blog Networks (PBNs)
Paid link schemes (risk of Google penalties)
Use Google Search Console or Semrush Backlink Audit to monitor and disavow toxic links.
5. Improve User Experience (UX)
Google factors Core Web Vitals and user engagement into rankings.
Steps to improve UX:
Test speed with PageSpeed Insights
Ensure Lighthouse metrics ‚â• 80 on mobile & desktop
Use tools like GTMetrix and WebPageTest
Optimize your end URLs (deep pages) first since they‚Äôre the ones appearing in search results.
6. Publish Consistently
Consistency builds topical authority.
Set a content calendar
Refresh old posts with updated stats & links
Use Google Trends to find timely topics
7. Build Authority via Partnerships
Ways to build credibility and backlinks together:
Guest posting on niche blogs (Guestpost.com)
Co-authoring industry studies
Appearing on podcasts or webinars
Example Roadmap: DA 19 ‚Üí DA 50
Month 1‚Äì2: Build 5‚Äì10 linkable assets
Month 2‚Äì3: Do 50+ outreach campaigns (broken links, mentions, guest posts)
Month 3‚Äì4: Publish 2‚Äì3 SEO-driven blogs per week
Month 5+: Audit backlink health + improve UX scores
Key Takeaways
Website authority scores (DA, DR, AS) are indicators, not ranking guarantees.
High-quality backlinks + strong content + great UX = sustainable growth.
With consistent effort, you can realistically move from DA 19 ‚Üí DA 50 in under a year.
