I just had a revelation

KMP for iOS is not production ready.
In my opinion, it's all about the money. The goal is to create a new product and push it as fast and as hard as possible. This often means lying in our advertisements and never stopping the cycle. If we did stop, developers might realize that there was nothing wrong with Java and XML views.
Without the pressure to keep up with new Android tech, Android developers could learn iOS development. Eventually, they might realize that a shared cross-platform codebase doesn't require Kotlin or a new framework when C and C++ are already available.
