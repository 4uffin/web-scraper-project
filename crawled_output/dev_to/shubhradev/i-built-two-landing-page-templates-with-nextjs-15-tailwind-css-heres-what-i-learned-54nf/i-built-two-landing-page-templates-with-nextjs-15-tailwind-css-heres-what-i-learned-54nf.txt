I Built Two Landing Page Templates with Next.js 15 & Tailwind CSS: Here’s What I Learned
#nextjs
#tailwindcss
#webdev
#sass
After countless late nights tweaking pixels, debugging, and wrestling with Next.js, I finally launched Launchpad and Launchpad Grow. Two landing page templates designed to make launching fast, clean, and headache-free.
Built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4, they’re SEO-optimized, mobile-first, and no-code-friendly, perfect for individuals, teams, and projects of any size.
In this post, I’ll share why I built them, what makes them tick, and some hard-earned lessons from the process (spoiler: responsive design gave me headaches 😅). If you’re into web dev, SaaS, or Next.js, this might spark ideas for your own projects-and maybe even save you some late-night debugging sessions.
Why I Built Launchpad & Launchpad Grow
As a developer, I’ve always loved the idea of launching projects quickly, but setting up landing pages from scratch can be a time sink. Between SEO, responsive design, and user-friendly CTAs, there’s a lot to juggle. I wanted to create something that makes launching easy-whether you’re an individual or an agency.
That’s where Launchpad and Launchpad Grow come in. These templates are my attempt to solve the pain points I faced: clunky setups, SEO oversights, and designs that don’t scale. Built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4, they’re lightweight, fast, and packed with features to help you hit the ground running.
What’s Inside These Templates?
Here’s a quick rundown of what each offers, without getting too technical (but I’ve got code snippets below if you’re curious!):
Launchpad: Launch Your SaaS, Faster Than Ever.
Key Features:
Built with Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4 for speed and flexibility.
SEO-ready with auto-generated sitemaps, schema.org, and FAQ JSON-LD.
Mobile-first design with lazy loading and PWA support for an app-like feel.
No-code contact forms via Formspree, no backend required!
Light/dark theme support with easy theming.
Basic Google Analytics with CTA tracking to see what’s working.
Open Graph and Twitter images for slick social shares.
Launchpad Grow: Launch Your SaaS. Go Global, Faster Than Ever
Key Features:
Everything in Launchpad, plus:
Internationalization (i18n) and RTL support for global audiences.
Advanced analytics with Google Analytics 4 and Sentry for error tracking.
Pre-built, i18n-ready privacy, terms, and disclaimer pages.
Contact forms powered by Resend for reliable email delivery.
Detailed docs for customization.
Both are designed to be no-code-friendly, with detailed documentation to make tweaks a breeze, whether you’re a dev or not.
Lessons from Building These Templates
Building Launchpad and Launchpad Grow was a rollercoaster. Here are three big takeaways that might save you some headaches:
1. SEO Is a Game-Changer
I underestimated how much SEO could boost a landing page’s reach. Adding auto-generated sitemaps, schema.org markup, and Open Graph images made a huge difference in visibility. For example, schema.org FAQ JSON-LD helps Google show rich snippets, which can drive clicks. If you’re building a landing page, don’t skip the SEO basics-it’s worth the effort.
// Example: Adding FAQ JSON-LD in Next.js
export const metadata = {
title: "Launchpad - Modern SaaS Landing Page Template | Launch Your SaaS, Faster Than Ever",
description:
"Supercharge your SaaS with Launchpad—an eye-catching, SEO-optimized landing page template made with Next.js 15 and the latest Tailwind CSS v4.",
,
openGraph: { /* OG tags */ },
};
const FaqJsonLd = () => (
<script type="application/ld+json">
{JSON.stringify({
"@context": "https://schema.org",
"@type": "FAQPage",
mainEntity: [
{
"@type": "Question",
name: "What is Launchpad?",
acceptedAnswer: {
"@type": "Answer",
text: "A no-code-friendly landing page template built with Next.js 15.",
},
},
],
})}
</script>
);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Responsive Design Is Hard but Worth It
Getting the mobile-first design right took hours of tweaking Tailwind classes. I learned to prioritize sm:, md:, and lg: breakpoints early and test on real devices (not just Chrome’s dev tools). Lazy loading images and leaning on Tailwind’s utility-first classes (sometimes extracted into reusable snippets with @apply) kept things fast. Launchpad loads in under 2 seconds on mobile!
/* Example: Responsive hero section with Tailwind */
.hero {
@apply relative min-h-[80vh] flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-10 scroll-mt-20 overflow-hidden;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Tailwind v4 Breakpoints Made Flexible
One thing I loved about Tailwind v4 is the ability to customize responsive breakpoints directly with theme variables. Instead of being locked to the defaults, I set my own to match real device ranges:
@theme {
/* Custom breakpoints */
--breakpoint-xs: 20rem;
/* very small phones (~320px) */
--breakpoint-sm: 30rem;
/* small phones (~480px) */
--breakpoint-md: 48rem;
/* tablets (~768px) */
--breakpoint-lg: 64rem;
/* laptops (~1024px) */
--breakpoint-xl: 80rem;
/* desktops (~1280px) */
--breakpoint-2xl: 96rem;
/* large screens (~1536px) */
--breakpoint-3xl: 120rem; /* extra large screens (~1920px) */
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
After defining these, I could use them naturally in my markup with utilities like xs:text-sm, md:px-8, or 3xl:grid. This gave me finer control for niche device sizes (like very small phones or big TVs) without breaking Tailwind’s mobile-first workflow.
4. No-Code Matters
I made both templates no-code-friendly after realizing not every user is a developer. Tools like Formspree for forms and global CSS theme variables (for colors, gradients, and breakpoints) mean anyone can customize the look and feel without digging into complex configuration. On top of that, I’ve written detailed documentation, especially for Launchpad Grow, covering things like adding your analytics IDs (GA4, Sentry) or plugging in API keys for Resend. The goal is to make setup as simple as copy and paste, so you can focus on launching instead of troubleshooting.
Why Next.js 15 & Tailwind CSS v4?
I chose these tools because they’re a perfect combo for speed and scalability:
Next.js 15: The new App Router and Turbopack make development a breeze, with fast builds and hot reloads. Plus, its SEO features (like dynamic metadata) are top-notch.
Tailwind CSS v4: The zero-config setup and utility-first approach keep the code clean, lightweight, and easy for anyone to extend.
Here’s a peek at how I set up a reusable button component:
"use client";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
export default function Button({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
return (
<motion.button
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
className="px-4 py-2 rounded-full bg-[rgb(var(--color-primary))] text-white font-semibold transition-all"
>
{children}
</motion.button>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In the full template, this Button also supports multiple variants (primary, outline, gradient), sizes, accessibility features, and animations. All wired up with Tailwind utilities and global CSS variables. This keeps the UI consistent and lets non-devs tweak styles via Tailwind classes.
