How I Boosted Landing Page Conversions by 25% with Next.js 15, Tailwind, i18n, and SEO
#nextjs
#buildinpublic
#tailwindcss
#seo
Ever shipped a sleek SaaS landing page-clean design, shiny CTA, Tailwind styles on point-only to watch users bounce faster than a bad API call?
That was me.
The page looked great, but sign-ups were flat. After some coffee-fueled debugging, I realized the problem. My landing page didn‚Äôt speak to everyone. Literally.
In today‚Äôs SaaS market, an English-only landing page with weak SEO leaves conversions on the table. So I doubled down on two things:
üåç Multi-language support (i18n + RTL)
üîç Solid SEO (dynamic meta tags + sitemaps)
The result? A 25% lift in sign-ups. Here‚Äôs how I did it, why it works, and how you can apply it in your own projects.
The Problem is Landing Pages That Look Good but Don‚Äôt Convert
Picture this- you‚Äôve got a polished landing page.
Headline? ‚úÖ Catchy.
CTA? ‚úÖ Bright and shiny.
Tailwind CSS? ‚úÖ Crisp and clean.
And yet‚Ä¶ users bounce. The sign-up form collects dust.
That was my situation. My page was visually fine but felt generic. It didn‚Äôt connect with global users, and it wasn‚Äôt optimized for search.
So I asked myself. How do I make this page feel personal and visible worldwide?
The answer is i18n + SEO.
Step 1: Multi-Language Support (i18n) for Global Reach
First up, I added multi-language support. Right now, I‚Äôve wired up:
üá¨üáß English
üá™üá∏ Spanish
üá∏üá¶ Arabic (with RTL support)
And thanks to next-intl, it‚Äôs ready to scale to 100+ languages later.
Why it matters
‚Ä¢Users trust sites that speak their language.
‚Ä¢A founder in Madrid or a developer in Dubai is more likely to convert if the page feels native.
‚Ä¢RTL (right-to-left) support isn‚Äôt just flipping the layout-it‚Äôs about making the UI flow naturally for Arabic readers (right-aligned text, proper button placement, etc.).
In my tests:
‚Ä¢i18n alone boosted conversions by ~15%
‚Ä¢Adding RTL for Arabic pushed it closer to 25%
How I did it
Install next-intl:
npm install next-intl
Set up a /messages folder with JSON files:
`// messages/en.json
{
"headline": "Build your SaaS landing page in minutes",
"cta": "Get Started"
}`
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
`// messages/es.json
{
"headline": "Crea tu p√°gina de aterrizaje SaaS en minutos",
"cta": "Empezar"
}`
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
// messages/ar.json
{
"headline": "ÿ£ŸÜÿ¥ÿ¶ ÿµŸÅÿ≠ÿ© SaaS ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿµŸàÿØÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿØŸÇÿßÿ¶ŸÇ",
"cta": "ÿßÿ®ÿØÿ£ ÿßŸÑÿ¢ŸÜ"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Load translations in layout.tsx or page.tsx using next-intl, and you‚Äôre set.
Step 2: SEO That Actually Works Globally
The second piece was SEO. But instead of hardcoding meta tags with messy ternaries, I plugged SEO straight into my translation system.
My translation JSON files (en.json, es.json, ar.json) don‚Äôt just hold button labels-they also store the page‚Äôs <title> and <meta description>. That means when someone lands on /es, both the page copy and the metadata are in Spanish. And yes-Google loves that.
Example setup
en.json
{
"seo": {
"title": "SaaS Launch",
"description": "Next.js + Tailwind templates for SaaS"
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
es.json
{
"seo": {
"title": "Lanzamiento SaaS",
"description": "Plantillas Next.js + Tailwind para SaaS"
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
generateMetadata.ts
import { getTranslations } from "next-intl/server";
export async function generateMetadata({ params: { locale } }) {
const t = await getTranslations({ locale });
return {
title: t("seo.title"),
description: t("seo.description")
};
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Why it works
Trust: When users see a title + description in their own language, they‚Äôre more likely to click and sign up.
CTR Boost: Localized snippets in Google search improve click-through rates.
Discoverability: Search engines treat localized metadata as unique content, helping you rank in multiple regions.
Scalability: Adding French, German, or Japanese tomorrow is just a matter of dropping another JSON file-no rewrites.
In my case, this alone helped my page feel more ‚Äúnative‚Äù and boosted sign-ups across non-English users.
The Takeaway
You don‚Äôt need a massive growth hack to see results. Sometimes, it‚Äôs about making your landing page feel human and local.
üåç i18n + RTL makes your site welcoming worldwide.
üîç SEO tied to translations makes your site visible worldwide.
Together, they gave me a 25% lift in conversions-without redesigning the page or touching the backend.
If you‚Äôre building SaaS landing pages with Next.js and Tailwind, I highly recommend trying this combo.
I‚Äôd love to hear from you-have you tried i18n or localized SEO in your projects? Any tips or tricks for improving landing page conversions would be amazing to learn!
