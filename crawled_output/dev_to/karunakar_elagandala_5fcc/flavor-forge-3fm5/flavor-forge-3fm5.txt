Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I've Built
The "Flavor Forge" applet is a tool that assists users in creating new recipes. It takes ingredients that the user inputs and uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to suggest delicious new recipes. The app aims to solve the problem of "What should I cook tonight?" by taking a few ingredients and generating a full recipe with instructions.
Demo
here's a link of deployed applet URL: https://flavor-forge-815232218770.us-west1.run.app
How I Used Google AI Studio
I built and deployed the "Flavor Forge" applet entirely on Google AI Studio. It was developed to specifically use Gemini's multimodal capabilities to analyze a list of ingredients and generate a creative and relevant recipe. The applet was then deployed to Cloud Run directly from the Google AI Studio interface.
About Applet
The AI-Powered Culinary Engine
"Flavor Forge is more than a recipe app; it's a multimodal AI for your kitchen. Leveraging the Gemini API, this applet performs on-the-fly ingredient analysis, generating novel, nutritionally balanced, and algorithmically optimized recipes in real-time. It's the ultimate kitchen-tech upgrade for the modern home chef, transforming your cooking experience with intelligent and personalized culinary creations."
_ Multimodal Features_
The app uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to analyze the ingredients provided by the user and then generate a recipe that incorporates them. The prompt to the model is carefully crafted to include the list of ingredients and a request for a detailed recipe, including instructions. This allows the model to go beyond a simple search and truly understand the context of the ingredients to create a unique culinary experience.
