Building Production-Ready AI Agents with LangGraph and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
In this fourth deep dive of our multi-framework series, I'll show you how to build a production-ready AI agent using LlamaIndex and deploy it using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. The complete code for this implementation, along with examples for other frameworks, is available on GitHub at agentcore-multi-framework-examples.
LlamaIndex takes a data-centric approach to agent development. While other frameworks focus primarily on orchestration and tool calling, LlamaIndex specializes in connecting agents with diverse data sources and building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines. This is useful when your agent needs to reason over documents, databases, or APIs while maintaining production-grade memory persistence through AgentCore.
LlamaIndex provides specialized components for every aspect of data processing—from ingestion and chunking to embedding and retrieval. This modular design works well with AgentCore's memory system, allowing me to build agents that process external data while maintaining searchable conversation histories.
Setting Up the Development Environment
I'll start by navigating to the LlamaIndex project within our multi-framework repository:
cd agentcore-multi-framework-examples/agentcore-llama-index
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The project uses several LlamaIndex packages for different capabilities:
llama-index-core
# Core agent and data framework
llama-index-llms-bedrock-converse
# Amazon Bedrock LLM integration
llama-index-embeddings-bedrock
# Bedrock embeddings for semantic search
llama-index-tools-wikipedia
# Wikipedia data source
llama-index-tools-requests
# Web request capabilities
bedrock-agentcore
# AgentCore SDK
bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit # Deployment tools
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Understanding the LlamaIndex Agent Architecture
LlamaIndex recently introduced the FunctionAgent, a streamlined agent implementation that focuses on tool use and conversation flow. Unlike the earlier ReActAgent, FunctionAgent leverages the native function-calling capabilities of modern LLMs, resulting in more reliable and efficient agent behavior.
The architecture I've built combines three key LlamaIndex concepts:
Global Settings Configuration
LlamaIndex uses a Settings object to configure global defaults for LLMs, embeddings, and processing parameters. This centralized configuration provides consistency across all components:
def initialize_llamaindex_settings():
"""Initialize LlamaIndex global settings."""
# Configure LLM
llm = BedrockConverse(
model="us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0",
)
# Configure embeddings
embed_model = BedrockEmbedding(
model_name="amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0",
region_name="us-east-1"
)
# Set global settings
Settings.llm = llm
Settings.embed_model = embed_model
Settings.chunk_size = 512
Settings.chunk_overlap = 50
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The BedrockConverse integration uses the Amazon Bedrock Converse API, which provides a unified interface across different foundation models. This means I can easily switch between Claude, Llama, or Amazon Nova models without changing my agent code.
Tool Integration
LlamaIndex tools follow a consistent interface through the FunctionTool abstraction. I've created a comprehensive tool suite that combines custom tools with pre-built integrations:
def create_llamaindex_tools(memory_manager=None) -> List[FunctionTool]:
"""Create a list of tools for the LlamaIndex agent."""
tools = []
# Basic function tools
tools.extend([
FunctionTool.from_defaults(
fn=calculator,
name="calculator",
description="Perform basic mathematical calculations"
),
FunctionTool.from_defaults(
fn=text_analyzer,
name="text_analyzer",
description="Analyze text and provide statistics"
)
])
# Add external tools
wikipedia_spec = WikipediaToolSpec()
wikipedia_tools = wikipedia_spec.to_tool_list()
tools.extend(wikipedia_tools)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The ToolSpec pattern allows entire tool suites to be packaged and shared. The Wikipedia and Requests tools come from LlamaHub, the LlamaIndex community tool repository, demonstrating how easy it is to extend agent capabilities.
Memory-Enhanced Context
Integrating AgentCore Memory with LlamaIndex requires dynamically updating the agent's system prompt based on retrieved memories, rather than just appending memories to prompts:
# Enhance the user input with memory context if available
if memory_manager:
memory_context = memory_manager.get_memory_context(
user_input=user_input,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id
)
# Update agent's system prompt if enhanced
if memory_context:
enhanced_prompt = f"{get_system_prompt()}\n\nRelevant context from previous interactions:\n{memory_context}"
agent_instance.update_prompts({"system_prompt": enhanced_prompt})
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
AgentCore Runtime Integration
The integration with AgentCore Runtime starts with the entrypoint function that receives requests and returns responses. Let me explain how each component works:
The Entrypoint Function
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
from bedrock_agentcore.runtime.context import RequestContext
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()
@app.entrypoint
async def invoke(payload: Dict[str, Any], context: Optional[RequestContext] = None) -> str:
"""AgentCore entrypoint for LlamaIndex agent invocation."""
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The @entrypoint decorator marks this function as the handler that AgentCore Runtime invokes when your agent receives a request. The function receives two parameters:
payload: A dictionary containing the request data, including the user's prompt
context: A RequestContext object that provides session information managed by AgentCore
Processing Requests
# Extract parameters from the request
user_input = payload.get("prompt", "Hello! What can you help me with?")
actor_id = payload.get("actor_id", DEFAULT_ACTOR_ID)
session_id = context.session_id if context and context.session_id else payload.get("session_id", DEFAULT_SESSION_ID)
logger.info(f"Processing request for actor_id: {actor_id}, session_id: {session_id}")
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The session_id from the RequestContext is particularly important—AgentCore Runtime automatically manages session isolation at iuinfrastructure level, giving each user their own isolated conversation space that persists across invocations.
Memory Enhancement Before Processing
Before the agent processes the request, I retrieve relevant memories and add them to the prompt:
# Enhance prompt with AgentCore memory context
memory_context = memory_manager.get_memory_context(
user_input=user_input,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id
)
# Update agent's system prompt if enhanced
if memory_context:
enhanced_prompt = f"{get_system_prompt()}\n\nRelevant context from previous interactions:\n{memory_context}"
agent_instance.update_prompts({"system_prompt": enhanced_prompt})
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The get_memory_context() method performs two operations:
Retrieves conversation history using the get_last_k_turns API
Searches for relevant memories using the RetrieveMemories operation
This enriched context becomes part of the agent's system prompt, providing historical context for the response generation.
Executing the Agent and Returning the Response
# Run the agent asynchronously
response = await agent_instance.run(user_input)
response_text = str(response)
# Store conversation after generating response
if memory_manager:
memory_manager.store_conversation(
user_input=user_input,
response=response_text,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id
)
# Return the text response
return response_text
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The function returns a string containing the agent's response. AgentCore Runtime takes this string and automatically:
Wraps it in the appropriate HTTP response structure
Handles response formatting for API Gateway
Manages error responses if exceptions occur
Notice the async keyword—the FunctionAgent in LlamaIndex supports asynchronous execution natively. This allows the agent to make multiple tool calls or process large documents without blocking other requests. The BedrockAgentCoreApp handles async functions transparently, whether running locally or deployed.
AgentCore Memory Integration
The memory system in this implementation uses AgentCore Memory to provide persistent context across sessions. Here's how it works:
Memory Retrieval and Prompt Enrichment
The memory integration happens in two phases. First, when the agent starts processing a request, it retrieves relevant memories to enrich the input:
# Get memory context using the shared memory manager
memory_context = memory_manager.get_memory_context(
user_input=user_input,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The get_memory_context() method performs these operations:
Load Conversation History: On the first invocation of a session, it calls the get_last_k_turns API to retrieve up to 100 previous conversation turns:
conversations = self.memory_client.get_last_k_turns(
memory_id=self.memory_config.memory_id,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id,
k=100
# Maximum conversation turns to retrieve
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Retrieve Relevant Memories: It performs semantic search using the RetrieveMemories operation to find relevant facts, preferences, and summaries:
memories = retrieve_memories_for_actor(
memory_id=memory_manager.memory_config.memory_id,
actor_id=actor_id,
search_query=user_input,
memory_client=memory_manager.memory_client
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The namespace structure /actor/{actor_id}/ provides complete isolation between users—each actor has their own memory space that other users cannot access.
Storing Conversations After Response
After the agent generates a response, the conversation is stored in AgentCore Memory:
# Store conversation in AgentCore Memory
memory_manager.store_conversation(
user_input=user_input,
response=response_text,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The store_conversation() method calls the create_event API:
messages_to_store = [
(user_input, 'USER'),
(response_text, 'ASSISTANT')
]
self.memory_client.create_event(
memory_id=self.memory_config.memory_id,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id,
messages=messages_to_store
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
When create_event is called, AgentCore Memory automatically:
Stores the raw conversation
Extracts user preferences using the UserPreferences strategy
Identifies semantic facts using the SemanticFacts strategy
Generates session summaries using the SessionSummaries strategy
These extracted insights become available for future retrievals, building the agent's long-term knowledge.
Memory as an Agentic Tool
I've also exposed memory retrieval as a tool that the agent can use strategically:
def retrieve_memories(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> str:
"""Retrieve relevant memories based on a query."""
try:
memories = retrieve_memories_for_actor(
memory_id=memory_manager.memory_config.memory_id,
actor_id=memory_manager.default_actor_id,
search_query=query,
memory_client=memory_manager.memory_client
)
if not memories:
return f"No relevant memories found for query: '{query}'"
result = f"Retrieved {len(memories)} memories for '{query}':\n\n"
for i, memory in enumerate(memories, 1):
content = memory.get('content', 'No content')
score = memory.get('score', 'N/A')
result += f"{i}. (Score: {score}) {content}\n"
return result
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Exposing memory retrieval as a tool gives the agent agency over its memory. Rather than automatically retrieving memories for every query, the agent can decide when memory context would be helpful. For instance, when asked about preferences, the agent might search for "user preferences" explicitly, or when solving a problem, it might search for similar problems from past conversations.
Context Window Management
LlamaIndex's context management is important when dealing with large documents or extensive conversation histories. The memory manager handles this by implementing a sliding window approach:
conversations = self.memory_client.get_last_k_turns(
memory_id=self.memory_config.memory_id,
actor_id=actor_id,
session_id=session_id,
k=100
# Retrieve up to 100 previous conversation turns
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The get_last_k_turns API efficiently retrieves recent conversation history without overwhelming the context window. This matters when using LlamaIndex with document-heavy workflows where context space is at a premium.
Deploying the Agent
The deployment process leverages the AgentCore Starter Toolkit's streamlined workflow. First, I configure the agent:
agentcore configure -n llamaindexagent -e main.py
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
When prompted, I accept the default values. This creates the necessary AWS infrastructure including IAM roles, ECR repositories, and Lambda function configurations.
Local Testing
Before deploying to the cloud, I always test locally to verify everything works correctly:
agentcore launch --local
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This starts a containerized version of the agent running on my local machine. The local environment exactly mirrors the production environment—same container, same runtime, same memory access.
Testing the local deployment:
agentcore invoke --local '{"prompt": "What did I say about fruit?"}'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The agent retrieves the sample memory we added during setup and responds appropriately. I can then test more complex scenarios:
agentcore invoke --local '{"prompt": "Search Wikipedia for information about apples and tell me if I would enjoy apple-based dishes"}'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This tests both the Wikipedia tool integration and memory retrieval, demonstrating how LlamaIndex agents can combine external data sources with personal context.
Production Deployment
Once satisfied with local testing, deploying to AWS is straightforward:
agentcore launch
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
AgentCore handles all the complex deployment tasks automatically. It builds the container image, pushes it to Amazon ECR, creates the Lambda function with proper networking configuration, sets up API Gateway endpoints, configures IAM permissions with least privilege access, and enables comprehensive CloudWatch logging.
After deployment completes, I check the status:
agentcore status
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This provides the endpoint ARN, CloudWatch log group, and other deployment details I need for monitoring and debugging.
What's Next
This LlamaIndex implementation demonstrates how to build data-centric agents with RAG capabilities while maintaining production-grade memory persistence. The framework's modular architecture and extensive tool ecosystem make it ideal for agents that need to process diverse data sources while maintaining conversational context.
In the next article, I'll explore LangGraph, showing how to build stateful, graph-based agent workflows using the same AgentCore infrastructure. You'll see how LangGraph's unique approach to agent orchestration enables complex, multi-step reasoning while leveraging our shared memory architecture.
The complete code is available on GitHub. I encourage you to experiment with the implementation and explore how LlamaIndex's document processing capabilities can enhance your agent's knowledge base beyond just conversation memory.
