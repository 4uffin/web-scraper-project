Hey devs, Ishant here 👋
Remember when I dropped my “Scholar’s Fortress” portfolio? Yeah, that was my serious academic flex.
This time, I went full chaos mode.
Welcome to GrandMap — my little side project that’s basically what would happen if Google Maps stole cheat codes from GTA. 🎮
🎲 What is GrandMap?
Imagine GTA’s minimap got tired of being stuck in Los Santos and decided to become a web app. That’s what GrandMap is.
Here’s what you can do:
🌍 Search anywhere on the planet
📍 Drop your own markers like mission checkpoints
🎨 Vibe straight out of Rockstar Games
Think of it like:
🤓 Google Maps = serious corporate taxi uncle
😎 GrandMap = your homie pulling up with mods enabled
🔧 Tech Stuff (the fun kind)
This isn’t just vibes — there’s real tech under the hood:
🗺️ Leaflet.js → powering the interactive map like a lightweight beast
🧙 ESRI API → the geo wizardry behind the scenes
🎨 Custom CSS + Carto + GTA-ish styling → because plain maps are boring
Future plans (aka chaos incoming):
“Cheats” like give all POIs or spawn boss building
(jk, you better be happy with current cheats 🔫)
Maybe even San Andreas radio when you pan around?
And yes… it already crashed once from too many POIs 💀 (got hit with a 429 error, felt like the cops were after me) — but hey, it’s patched now.
🕹️ Gameplay Features
Zoom, pan, and vibe like a free-roam mod
Custom markers → make your own “safehouses”
Future cheat console?? (👀 type HESOYAM for infinite POIs… sadly no, it won’t work 💀)
Right now, it’s more of a meme tool than a serious productivity app, but honestly — that’s the point. 😂
❓ Why tho?
Because being a dev is supposed to be fun.
Sometimes you build serious stuff (like my AI school assistant 🧑‍💻), and sometimes…
…you make GTA Maps but in real life.
🚀 What’s Next?
Add sound effects? (San Andreas radio??)
Integrate a mission system?
Or keep it chaotic as hell.
Either way, it’s gonna stay GrandMap — your friendly GTA-inspired web map.
👉 Try it here: grandmap.vercel.app
💬 What cheat code would YOU add if you could?
