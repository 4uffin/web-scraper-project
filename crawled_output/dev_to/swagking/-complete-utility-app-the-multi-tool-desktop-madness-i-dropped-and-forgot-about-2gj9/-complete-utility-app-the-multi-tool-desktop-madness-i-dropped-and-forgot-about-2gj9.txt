# 🛠️ Complete Utility App — The Multi-Tool Desktop Madness I Dropped (And Forgot About)

Hey devs, Ishant here 👋
Back in April, I quietly dropped this desktop app on GitHub.
The date? April 1st. Yeah, April Fools’ Day.
But no joke — I actually built a real multi-tool app and then… just never promoted it.
Six months later, I finally remembered:
“Oh wait… I should probably tell people this exists.” 💀
So here it is. The Complete Utility App.
(PS: check the in-app documentation and About section for tips & tricks!)
🚀 What is it?
It’s like carrying 10 different little apps in one — a desktop Swiss Army knife.
Instead of bouncing between random sites and tools, I made one app to rule them all.
Here’s what it can do:
📥 YouTube and Universal Downloader (video/audio) → try MP4/WEBM, your choice, supports 8k resolution for videos having it and automatic best audio selector, select what you want: audio, video, or maybe… both!
📦 File Converter (images, docs, etc.)
🔑 Encryption/Decryption Tool → uses SHA256, so don’t forget your master password after encrypting something (unless you want it gone 😭)
📄 PDF Toolkit (merge, split, rename)
📸 OCR (Image → Text) → supports 20+ languages, but I’d suggest removing extra languages to avoid chaos 💀
⛶ QR Code Generator → choose your desired size
🎨 Custom Themes → personalize CUT to your aesthetic!
⚡ …and more little utilities packed in
Basically: if it’s a common “utility” task, I probably baked it in.
🎬 Show, Don’t Tell
I didn’t just make a README and call it a day.
The repo has GIFs showing the app in action, so you don’t need to guess.
👉 Check it out on GitHub
🛠️ Tech Stuff
Python + tkinter → UI and core
FFmpeg, PyPDF2, pytesseract → the heavy lifters under the hood
Cross-platform builds → packaged so you don’t need to deal with dependencies
Good ol’ GitHub Releases → grab and run
😂 Why tho?
Honestly?
Because I was tired of juggling shady “online converter” websites with 5 pop-ups per click.
So I thought: why not build a legit offline app that just works?
Also… I like building random stuff for fun.
🕹️ The Reality Check
I dropped it in April, forgot about it, did zero marketing… and after 6 months?
⭐ 2 Stars
📥 9 Downloads
💀 That’s it.
So yeah… not exactly trending on GitHub.
But hey, every project starts somewhere.
🙌 What’s Next
This time, I’m actually promoting it (starting with this post).
If people find it useful, I’ll:
Add new utilities
Polish the UI
Maybe even do cross-platform installers
And of course, feedback is gold — if you try it, let me know what worked / what sucked.
💬 Your Turn
What’s one “utility” you wish you had in an app like this?
I might just add it.
👉 Grab it here
👉 Star it if you like it ⭐ (stars are free, and my repo looks lonely rn 😭)
Thanks for reading — and no, this isn’t an April Fools’ joke. I promise.
— Ishant 🖤
