Deploying Containers on AWS: The One Guide You Need
#aws
#containers
#cloud
#kubernetes
When I first started working with containers on AWS, I was overwhelmed. There were too many services‚ÄîECS, EKS, Lambda, App Runner, Lightsail‚Äîand each one came with its own pros and cons. The real struggle wasn‚Äôt running containers; it was deciding where to run them.
If you‚Äôve ever felt the same, you‚Äôre not alone. That‚Äôs why I put together this guide. Think of it as a friendly map‚Äîhelping you pick the right AWS service without drowning in documentation.
Step 1: Ask Yourself ‚Äî Do You Need Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is powerful, but also complex. If you‚Äôre already using it or plan to, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is the natural choice.
Pros: Fully managed, highly scalable.
Cons: Setup isn‚Äôt beginner-friendly, and pricing is resource-based.
If Kubernetes isn‚Äôt part of your journey, no worries. AWS has plenty of other roads to explore.
Step 2: Serverless or Provisioned?
This is the big fork in the road.
If you want AWS to handle servers for you ‚Üí go Serverless.
If you want full control over compute resources ‚Üí go Provisioned.
The Serverless Path üöÄ
Not sure if serverless is the right direction?
I wrote a separate guide on When to Go Serverless. that might help you decide.
The Provisioned Path ‚öôÔ∏è
If you prefer setting things up yourself:
Lightsail: Simplest UI, great for small projects.
Catch: You‚Äôre locked into AWS‚Äôs ecosystem.
ECS (Elastic Container Service): Managed orchestration without Kubernetes.
Best for: Teams that need scaling + orchestration but don‚Äôt want Kubernetes overhead.
Downside: Steep learning curve.
EC2: Old-school way‚Äîinstall Docker and manage everything yourself.
Best for: Absolute control freaks.
Downside: Frustrating setup and heavy maintenance.
A Visual Shortcut
Here‚Äôs a handy flowchart to guide your decision:
This chart sums up everything we just walked through‚Äîso you can quickly see which AWS service matches your needs.
Final Thoughts
There isn‚Äôt a single ‚Äúbest‚Äù way to run containers on AWS. The right choice depends on your priorities:
Ease of use? ‚Üí Lightsail or App Runner.
Serverless-first mindset? ‚Üí Lambda or Fargate.
Already love Kubernetes? ‚Üí EKS.
Want to tinker with everything? ‚Üí EC2.
The good news is, no matter which road you take, AWS has you covered. Start small, experiment, and you‚Äôll soon find the perfect fit for your workloads.
