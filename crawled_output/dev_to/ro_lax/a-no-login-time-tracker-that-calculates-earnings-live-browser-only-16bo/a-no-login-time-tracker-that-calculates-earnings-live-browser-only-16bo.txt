A no-login time tracker that calculates earnings live (browser-only)
#webdev

Use it here: https://www.konverter-online.com/time-tracker
A tiny, no-login time tracker that runs entirely in your browser. Add your Hourly Rate + Currency, hit Start, and see Total Time and Total Earnings update live.
What it is (and isn‚Äôt)
This is a frictionless time tracker for quick sessions:
No accounts, no sync, no team features.
No data leaves your browser (local persistence).
Built to answer one question fast:
‚ÄúIf my rate is X, how much am I earning right now?‚Äù
If you need clients, invoices, or collaboration, this isn‚Äôt that.
If you want a fast, private, single-player timer with live earnings, this is it.
Try it in 10 seconds
Open https://www.konverter-online.com/time-tracker
(Optional) Fill Project Name and Category
Set Hourly Rate and Currency
Press Start ‚Üí watch time and earnings tick in real-time
Stop when you‚Äôre done
Features (today)
No login. Everything runs client-side.
Live earnings. earnings = (elapsed_minutes / 60) √ó hourly_rate
Project & Category (optional) to label your session
Local persistence so a refresh doesn‚Äôt nuke the session
Currency formatting via Intl.NumberFormat
Coming next (short roadmap)
CSV export (start/end, duration, rate, earnings, currency, note)
Idle auto-pause after Xs of inactivity
PWA (install to Home Screen; offline)
Keyboard shortcuts (Start/Stop/Reset)
Notes per session and a weekly overview
If any of these matter to you, say which one and why‚Äîwill prioritize.
