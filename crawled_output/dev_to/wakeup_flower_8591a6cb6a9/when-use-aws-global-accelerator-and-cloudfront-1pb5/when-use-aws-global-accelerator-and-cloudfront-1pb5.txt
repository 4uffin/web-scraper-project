When use Aws Global Accelerator / CloudFront
#cloud
#networking
#architecture
#aws
1Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Global Accelerator
Purpose: Improve availability and performance of TCP/UDP traffic for your global users.
Use case: You have applications hosted in multiple AWS regions (EC2, ALB, NLB) and you want:
Low-latency routing to the closest healthy region.
Automatic failover if a region or endpoint goes down.
Traffic type: Any TCP/UDP traffic, including non-HTTP protocols (gaming, IoT, APIs).
Mechanism:
Uses static IP addresses as entry points.
Routes traffic over the AWS global network instead of the public internet ‚Üí faster & more reliable.
‚úÖ Example:
Multi-region web application with ALB in us-east-1 and eu-west-1.
Users in Europe ‚Üí routed to eu-west-1, users in US ‚Üí routed to us-east-1.
If a region fails ‚Üí traffic automatically goes to the other region.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Amazon CloudFront
Purpose: Distribute content to end users via a global edge network.
Use case: You want low-latency delivery of static or dynamic content (web pages, images, videos, API responses).
Traffic type: HTTP / HTTPS only.
Mechanism:
Caches content at edge locations close to users.
Can integrate with S3, ALB, API Gateway, or custom origins.
Provides DDoS protection via AWS Shield Standard.
‚úÖ Example:
Website hosted in US.
Users in Asia ‚Üí get content from nearest CloudFront edge instead of traveling all the way to US.
Dynamic API requests can also go through CloudFront with caching + origin failover.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Rule of Thumb
Use Global Accelerator ‚Üí You need fast, highly available routing for any type of traffic across regions.
Use CloudFront ‚Üí You want content cached at edges for HTTP/HTTPS to improve user experience and reduce load on origin.
üí° Bonus: You can combine both.
CloudFront for caching content at edges.
Global Accelerator to route users to the closest regional origin if you have multiple regions.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Example Scenario
Video recommendation engine: Dynamic content generation (personalized).
EC2 Auto Scaling behind ALB: Scales within a single AWS Region.
Global users: Millions worldwide.
Challenge: Reduce latency for global users while keeping costs optimized.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Requirements
Low latency for global users ‚Üí users far from the Region experience slow response.
Dynamic content (personalized) ‚Üí can‚Äôt just cache everything; caching is limited.
Scalability ‚Üí must handle millions of users.
Cost-optimized ‚Üí can‚Äôt deploy full workloads in multiple regions if not necessary.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Candidate AWS Services
Option
Analysis
Amazon CloudFront
Great for caching static content or dynamic content via edge locations. Supports dynamic content acceleration (dynamic origin fetch). Can improve performance for dynamic APIs. Cost-effective, no need to deploy EC2 globally.
AWS Global Accelerator
Routes traffic over the AWS global network to the closest healthy regional endpoint. Optimizes TCP/UDP routing. Useful for multi-region setups. May be overkill if you only have one region.
Deploy EC2/ALB in multiple regions
True multi-region deployment reduces latency but increases cost (duplicate infrastructure + cross-region replication). Not cost-optimized.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Recommended Solution: CloudFront with dynamic content acceleration
Why?
CloudFront can accelerate dynamic content by using edge locations globally ‚Üí reduces latency for API calls.
Users still hit the single backend region (EC2/ALB), so no need to deploy additional EC2 in other regions ‚Üí cost-optimized.
Works seamlessly with personalized recommendations because CloudFront supports cache-control headers and dynamic origin fetch.
Optionally, you can add Lambda\@edge to do minor personalization or pre-processing at edge locations if needed.

Users worldwide ‚Üí requests routed to nearest CloudFront edge ‚Üí CloudFront forwards dynamic requests to ALB ‚Üí EC2 generates personalized recommendations.
Static assets (images, thumbnails, CSS/JS) can be fully cached at CloudFront ‚Üí reduces load on EC2.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Why not Global Accelerator?
GA is better when you have multiple regional endpoints and need fast failover + optimized routing.
In this case: single region ‚Üí GA adds extra cost but won‚Äôt reduce latency as effectively as CloudFront for dynamic HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
‚úÖ Answer: Use Amazon CloudFront in front of your ALB + EC2 backend.
Improves global performance
Scales automatically
Cost-efficient
Supports both static and dynamic content
