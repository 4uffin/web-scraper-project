StormQueries ‚Äì A Query Builder with ORM Superpowers
Over the years working in web development, I‚Äôve tried countless tools for working with databases.
Most of the time, they fell into one of two categories:
Query Builders (QB) ‚Äì lightweight, fast, no schema configuration required. Great for quick queries. The downside? Once you need hierarchical data (1 invoice ‚Üí many items), you‚Äôre on your own.
ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) ‚Äì powerful for handling relationships, but heavy and often require models, annotations, or schema definitions.
And I kept thinking: why isn‚Äôt there something in between?
So I built StormQueries üöÄ
Why StormQueries?
StormQueries combines the simplicity of a Query Builder with the power of an ORM.
Here‚Äôs what it gives you out of the box:
‚úÖ Build dynamic queries depending on runtime parameters.
‚úÖ Reusable query structures.
‚úÖ Hierarchical data fetching (one-to-many).
‚úÖ Map results to your own objects without modifying models.
‚úÖ Zero schema configuration ‚Äì just connect to the database.
‚úÖ Support for subqueries.
‚úÖ Intuitive syntax.
One example:
With StormQueries, you can run an incremental update (field = field + 1) ‚Äî something that‚Äôs oddly tricky or impossible in many other tools.
Quick examples
Basic CRUD:
$product = $queries->find('products', ['id' => 5]);
$id = $queries->insert('products', [
'name' => 'Golden watch',
'price' => 465
]);
$queries->update('products', ['id' => $id], ['name' => 'Renamed product']);
$queries->delete('products', ['id' => $id]);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Dynamic filtering:
$query = $queries
->select('products')
->join('product_photos', ['product_photos.product_id' => 'products.id'])
->where('is_in_sale', true);
if ($criteria->hasCategory()) {
$query->where('category_id', $criteria->getCategoryId());
}
$products = $query->findAll();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Subqueries:
$queries
->select(SubQuery::create($queries->select('products'), 'p'))
->where('p.product_id', 7)
->find();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
ORM-style relationships (without schema config):
$customer = $queries
->select('customers c', Map::select([
'customer_id',
'customer_name'
], Customer::class, classId: 'customer_id'))
->leftJoin('orders o', 'o.customer_id = c.customer_id', Map::many("orders", [
'order_id'
], Order::class, classId: 'order_id'))
->where('c.customer_id', 90)
->find();
foreach ($customer->orders as $order) {
echo $customer->customer_name . " - " . $order->id;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How is it different?
Doctrine / Eloquent (PHP) ‚Äì require schema definitions and models. StormQueries works right after connecting.
SQLAlchemy, Hibernate ‚Äì powerful but heavy, with lots of boilerplate. StormQueries is lightweight and fast.
Pure Query Builders ‚Äì flexible, but no hierarchical mapping. StormQueries bridges the gap.

Final thoughts
StormQueries was born out of real-world needs: I wanted the simplicity of Query Builders with the convenience of ORMs, without their usual trade-offs.
If this sounds useful, check it out, give it a ‚≠ê on GitHub, or drop me some feedback.
Issues, discussions, and pull requests are more than welcome üôå
This is just the beginning ‚Äî I‚Äôm planning more features inspired by real application use cases. Stay tuned!

While I applaud your effort creating the library, I think Doctrine DBAL provides a more extensive base to build upon than starting from scratch.
Things you are missing, compared to Doctrine DBAL:
union, distinct and probably more sql keywords
transactions
administrative queries (list tables, creating tables, ...)
type conversions for different databases. Not all databases have all the types or use different type names.
I think you created a smart solution for the relationship object result. I would suggest to add the configuration to the find or findAll method instead.
I could look like this
find(map: [
[User::class, MapFrequency::Once, ['customer_id', 'customer_name'],]
[Order::class, MapFrequency::EveryTime, ['order_id'], 'orders']
]);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This configuration makes the query builder flow more readable. And when union is added you could add MapFrequency::OnColumnValues.

Nice post! StormQueries hits a sweet spot, powerful query features without all the heavy ORM setup
