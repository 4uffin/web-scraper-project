Stylo AI: From Garment Digital Twin to RealLife Photography
#devchallenge

This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
Stylo AI is a web-based, multi-tool AI photoshoot studio that automates and streamlines virtual fashion photography. The app empowers usersâ€”including designers, photographers, and retailersâ€”to instantly generate photorealistic images of models wearing custom garments, revise poses, and place subjects in new AI-generated environments. Stylo AI solves the time-consuming and costly process of manual photoshoots by enabling anyone to produce high-quality fashion visuals with advanced accuracy, style control, and workflow efficiency.
Demo

How I Used Google AI Studio
Stylo AI is built on Google AI Studio, using the @google/genai SDK for seamless access to Geminiâ€™s multimodal image and text generation capabilities. All AI interactionsâ€”including image synthesis, pose transformation, and rigorous output evaluationâ€”are handled via a dedicated Gemini Service Layer. The primary models used are gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview for image-to-image tasks and gemini-2.5-pro for self-validation and JSON-based evaluation, ensuring the highest fidelity and accuracy in generated outputs.
Being this my first experience with Google AI Studio it has been eyes opening to me as a seasoned development that we need to jump into the wagon. I have been able to very quickly prototype and iterate different ideas just by maintaining a conversation with an AI assistant, and the results are impressive. The functionalities quickly prototyped here may be integrated in the future as part of a bigger product in our company.
Multimodal Features
Stylo AI implements advanced multimodal workflows with the following tools:
Avatar: Precise inpainting to standardize model photos for virtual try-ons using user-provided images.
Try-on: Deep image synthesis integrating model and garment images, with automated output validation via structured JSON scoring for realism and garment fidelity.
Pose: AI-driven pose transformation by matching a reference sketch, ensuring the modelâ€™s identity, attire, and background are preserved.
Environment: AI matte painting places the model in a new, thematic environment, matching lighting and ambiance based on an inspiration image.
These features let users manipulate images, sketches, and reference environments, providing end-to-end control over fashion photoshoots and dramatically enhancing creative possibilities, realism, and productivity in virtual photography.
Thank you for the opportunity to participate!
