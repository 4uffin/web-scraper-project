Building Language Tech for Meghalaya: Lessons from Tokenizing Khasi and Garo with Modern LLMs

When people talk about AI and language models, they rarely mean languages like Khasi or Garo. But for those of us working in Northeast India, that‚Äôs exactly where the challenge‚Äîand the opportunity‚Äîlies.
Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been diving deep into how modern LLMs handle tokenization for low-resource languages, especially those with unique orthographic features. Khasi (Austroasiatic) and Garo (Tibeto-Burman) aren‚Äôt just linguistically rich‚Äîthey‚Äôre structurally distinct from the Indo-Aryan mainstream. That makes them a fascinating testbed for evaluating how well current models preserve linguistic authenticity.
üîç What I Found
Most open-source LLMs tokenize these languages poorly. Diacritics get corrupted, middle dots turn into hex gibberish, and meaningful units are fractured. Even models with massive vocabularies struggle unless they‚Äôve been trained with orthographic sensitivity.
I ran a systematic evaluation across five models‚Äîincluding Gemma, Falcon, LLaMA, and Nemotron‚Äîusing both efficiency and authenticity metrics. The results were surprising: one model nailed it, most didn‚Äôt.
üß™ Why Tokenization Matters
If your tokenizer breaks a word like ka¬∑la¬∑√Ø into meaningless fragments, downstream tasks like translation, speech synthesis, or search will fail. For civic tech, that‚Äôs not just a bug‚Äîit‚Äôs a barrier to access.
üå± What Comes Next
This isn‚Äôt just about benchmarking. It‚Äôs about building a reproducible, region-first ecosystem for language tech in Meghalaya. I‚Äôve released the evaluation framework as a public artifact, and I‚Äôm working toward open-source models that respect the linguistic integrity of Khasi and Garo.
If you‚Äôre building LLMs, working on STT/TTS, or deploying civic tech in Northeast India, tokenization isn‚Äôt a footnote‚Äîit‚Äôs foundational.
üôå Final Thought
Language tech isn‚Äôt just about scale‚Äîit‚Äôs about respect. And sometimes, the smallest tokens carry the biggest meaning.
