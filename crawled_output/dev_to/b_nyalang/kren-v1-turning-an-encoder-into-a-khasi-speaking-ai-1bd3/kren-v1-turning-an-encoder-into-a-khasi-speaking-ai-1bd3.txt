Kren v1: Turning an Encoder into a Khasi-Speaking AI
#nlp
#khasi
#meghalaya
Most generative AI models donâ€™t speak Khasi. Or several Northeast Indian language, really. So, I built Kren v1â€”a compact, GPT-2-style model that can generate Khasi text, trained from scratch by converting an encoder into a decoder.
This wasnâ€™t just a fine-tuning job. It was a full architectural pivot.
ðŸ”„ From KhasiBERT to Kren
Kren started life as KhasiBERT, a RoBERTa-style encoder trained on Khasi. But encoders donâ€™t generateâ€”they classify. So I reworked it into a decoder, transferring weights and adapting it to GPT-2â€™s causal format.
Why bother? Because thereâ€™s no generative model for Khasi. And building one from scratch with limited data is tough.
ðŸ“Š Training Breakdown
I tested different data sizes to find the sweet spot for generation qualityâ€”not just loss scores. Hereâ€™s how it played out:
Version
Lines of Khasi Text
Loss
Notes
v0.1
300K
3.149
Basic generation, short replies
v0.2
800K
2.995
Dialogue improves
v1.0
1M
2.960
Abstract reasoning kicks in
v0.4
2M
2.903
Lower loss, but degraded output
More data didnâ€™t mean better results. At 2M lines, the model started to lose coherenceâ€”so I stuck with 1M for the final release.
ðŸ§µ What Kren Can Do
Kren v1 can generate Khasi text about:
Places
Cultural topics
Abstract reasoning and multi-sentence replies
Itâ€™s not perfectâ€”thereâ€™s a 514-token limit, and it can hallucinate or reflect biases. But itâ€™s a start.
ðŸš€ Try It Yourself
You can test it on Hugging Face or load it locally with:
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("MWirelabs/kren-v1")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("MWirelabs/kren-v1")
inputs = tokenizer("Ka Khasi ka", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs.input_ids, max_length=100, temperature=0.8)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
ðŸŒ± Why This Matters
Kren v1 shows that itâ€™s possible to build generative models for low-resource languagesâ€”even by converting encoders. Itâ€™s compact, reproducible, and open for anyone to build on.
If youâ€™re working on regional NLP or want to explore encoder-to-decoder conversions, check out MWire Labs. Weâ€™re building tools that reflect the linguistic diversity of Northeast Indiaâ€”quietly, but with purpose.
