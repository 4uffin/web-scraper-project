Stop Polishing Pixels. Start Bumping Versions.

Indie devs, I see you.
Pixel-pushing that landing page. Debating if that button should be 1px taller. Sitting on 0.100.0 releases because “it’s not 1.0 ready.”
Guess what? Nobody cares. Users don’t read semver like you do. They care if you ship, if it works, and if you improve fast.
The Fear of 1.0
I’ve been there:
“1.0 feels permanent.”
“What if it’s buggy?”
“I’ll look unprofessional.”
That fear freezes momentum. You end up stuck polishing details that don’t move your MRR.
Flip the Mindset
What if you treated version bumps as momentum markers instead of perfection badges?
1.0.0 — The first time someone pays.
2.0.0 — You fix a core workflow.
3.0.0 — You overhaul onboarding.
Every bump is a story to tell your users, your community, your future self. Each one says: this thing is alive.
Shipping > Perfecting
So stop hiding behind .0.100.0.
Bump majors often.
Celebrate progress.
Keep momentum rolling.
Because SaaS isn’t about perfect pixels. It’s about compounding small wins until one day you look back and realize: wow, this thing grew up.
🚀 At Indie10k, we help indie devs build momentum by turning growth into repeatable loops—not perfection traps. If you’re ready to stop stalling at 0.100.0 and start stacking wins toward $10k MRR, join us and start your first loop today.
