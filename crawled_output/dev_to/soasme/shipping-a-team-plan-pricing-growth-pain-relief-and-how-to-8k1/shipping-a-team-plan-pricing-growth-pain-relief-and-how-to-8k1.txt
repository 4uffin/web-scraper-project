Shipping a Team Plan: Pricing, Growth, Pain Relief, and How-To

Adding a Team plan (we call it “Crew”) is one of the highest‑leverage levers for a product graduating from solo users to real collaboration. It changes your pricing, accelerates growth loops, removes a latent blocker for buyers, and—done right—doesn’t require a rewrite.
Here’s how we approached it in Indie10k, what we learned, and how you can ship it without derailing your roadmap.
Why a Team Plan Matters
Momentum spreads in groups. When collaborators see each other’s progress, they keep pace.
Expansion revenue beats pure acquisition. Teams raise ARPU and unlock account‑level upgrades.
The “but my co‑founder needs access” objection disappears once you support basic roles.
Pricing Model: From Individual to Account Seats
We priced Crew around an account‑level seat pool, not per‑project invites.
Account seats represent unique collaborators across all owned projects.
Pending invites consume seats; revoking frees them immediately.
The owner doesn’t count against the pool, and the same collaborator on multiple projects counts once.
This strikes a balance between predictable revenue and flexibility for small teams or collectives. For Indie10k:
Free/Builder/Hacker: solo or limited collaboration (0 seat pool by default)
Crew: includes a pooled seat allowance (e.g., 3 seats)
Env example:
ENABLE_TEAM=true
TEAM_DEFAULT_SEAT_POOL=0
TEAM_CREW_SEAT_POOL=3
TEAM_INVITE_EXPIRES_DAYS=7
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Tip: Map seats to paid tiers via your billing mapping rather than baking prices into code.
Growth Effects: ARPU, Viral Loops, Retention
Higher ARPU: Accounts upgrade to unlock more collaborators; seat caps create natural upsell moments.
Product‑led invites: Each invite is a low‑friction acquisition touchpoint; acceptance funnels new users into your product.
Retention via accountability: Teams return to close loops together (status checks, evidence sharing, and reviews).
Instrumentation ideas:
Track seat‑cap‑reached events as an upsell signal.
Measure invite acceptance rate and time‑to‑first‑action post‑accept.
Segment retention by “solo vs team” to quantify the impact.
Pain It Solves (Real Quotes We Heard)
“I can’t add my co‑founder without sharing my login.”
“We split projects between personal accounts—now everything’s scattered.”
“We need read‑only for the advisor and write for the dev.”
Answer: roles (reader, writer, admin, owner) with predictable behavior and a simple members UI.
How To Ship It (Fast, Safely)
The path we used—minimal, reversible, and feature‑flagged.
1) Start With a Tight PRD
Keep scope lean: invites by email, roles, a members panel, seat enforcement, and secure tokens. Our full PRD is in docs/team-prd.md and covers:
Roles matrix and non‑goals for v1.
Account‑level seat pool rules.
Security (hashed, expiring, single‑use tokens; no email enumeration).
2) Schema + Services (Server‑First)
Add two tables:
project_members(project_id, user_id, role, status, …)
project_invites(project_id, email, role, token_hash, expires_at, status, …)
Service helpers (server‑only):
requireRole(projectId, userId, minRole)
createInvite(projectId, email, role, invitedBy)
acceptInvite(token, userId)
changeMemberRole(...), removeMember(...), revokeInvite(inviteId)
Seat math: getSeatPoolSize(ownerId) + getSeatsUsed(ownerId) (distinct users + pending emails across all owner projects)
3) APIs That Mirror the Mental Model
POST /api/projects/:id/invites → create invite (admin+)
POST /api/team/invites/accept → accept invite (auth)
PATCH /api/projects/:id/members/:userId → change role (admin+)
DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId → remove (admin+)
DELETE /api/projects/:id/invites/:inviteId → revoke (admin+)
POST /api/projects/:id/invites/:inviteId/resend → rotate token + resend (admin+, rate‑limited)
GET /api/projects/:id/members → list members + pending invites + seat usage
Guard every route with server‑side role checks. Keep responses predictable: NextResponse.json({ ... }, { status }).
4) Email + Accept Flow
Invite email includes an accept URL: /invite/accept?token=....
The page calls POST /api/team/invites/accept and redirects to the project.
In dev: RESEND_API_KEY=STDOUT to safely preview emails in logs.
5) Members UI That Doesn’t Overreach
A members list with roles and a simple invite form.
A seat meter that reads “X of Y seats used (account‑wide)”.
Pending invites with “Resend” and “Revoke”.
Show names/emails instead of raw IDs for clarity.
6) Ratchets, Not Roadblocks
Use rate limits where abuse is likely (invite create/resend). Fail‑open on missing infra in dev.
// Example keys
invite:create:user:{userId}
invite:resend:user:{userId}
invite:resend:project:{projectId}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
7) Secure by Default
Hash tokens (sha256 with a salt) and store only the hash.
Enforce expiry on accept; treat missing keys as 500 in production.
Avoid email enumeration; always respond with a generic “Invite sent”.
Example PRD (Summary)
Roles: reader, writer, admin, owner. Readers view; writers edit and run actions; admins manage members; owner is immutable and can delete the project.
Seat Pool: unique collaborators across owner’s projects; pending invites count; revokes free seats immediately.
UI: Members list, invite form, seat meter, and clear error states.
Reference: see docs/team-prd.md for the complete matrix and constraints.
Implementation Guide (Summary)
We documented the exact stack‑aligned steps (Drizzle schema, App Router routes, Zod validators, Resend emails, Stack Auth checks) in docs/team-impl.md.
Highlights:
Feature flag: ENABLE_TEAM hides everything until you’re ready.
Role checks: centralized with requireRole() and reused across routes.
Access scope: extend project listings and fetches to include active members (not just owners), while locking down mutations to writer/admin.
Final Notes
If you’ve got even a handful of users asking “Can I invite my co‑founder?”, a Team plan unlocks not just collaboration—but an entire business model path: expansion revenue, stickier usage, and more reliable growth.
Ship it small. Lock it down. Iterate from there.
