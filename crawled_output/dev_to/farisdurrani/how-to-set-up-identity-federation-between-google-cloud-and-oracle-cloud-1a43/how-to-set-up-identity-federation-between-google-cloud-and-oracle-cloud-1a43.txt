How to set up Identity SAML Federation between Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
Setting up Identity Federation will allow users to log into OCI using their GCP IAM organization credentials, rather than logging in using a new username-password in OCI. This can improve credential management and security by having a central place to store all user logins.
We will replicate the steps in Oracle Docs: Task 6: Set Up Identity Federation (Optional) with some UI updates. This is an optional succession to the How to create an Oracle Autonomous Database@Google Cloud article we wrote.
Prerequisites
Have an OCI account
Have a GCP account and an associating GCP Workspace IAM Admin console at https://admin.google.com. Note that this requires you having and associating a private
DNS domain (e.g. example.com) to the Google Cloud Admin console
1. Create groups in GCP Admin Console
While not strictly necessary, this helps to confirm the JIT (Just-in-time) provisioning works as intended. You can create any group but we recommend at least one group name already present in OCI and GCP ("odbg-db-family-administrators") and one other only present in GCP ("example-group415") for POC purposes.
We create a number of groups in the GCP Admin console: https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/groups. If you came from the Oracle Database@Google Cloud article, we created the groups for Autonomous Database access based on Oracle Docs: Task 5: Set Up Role Based Access Control:
2. Create a new custom SAML app in GCP
Go to https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/apps/unified and click on Add app > Add custom SAML app.
We added the following app details:
App name: OracleCloudFederation
Description: Configures identity federation between Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud for Oracle Database@Google Cloud use.
Click CONTINUE.
In the next page, Download Metadata. Leave this page open for now.
3. Add SAML IdP in OCI
Log into your OCI account. Go to ☰ Menu > Identity & Security > Domains > Default (or another domain) > Federation > Actions > Add SAML IdP.
We give the SAML identity provider a random name:
Import the downloaded IdP metadata from GCP:
Leave this page open.
4. Add SAML IdP in GCP
Click on Export SAML metadata to export the OCI SAML metadata details.
Switch view from Metadata file to Manual export.
Go back to the GCP Admin page. Click CONTINUE.
Copy paste the OCI values into GCP like so:
GCP
OCI
ACS URL
Assertion consumer service URL
Entity ID
Provider ID
Leave the Name ID details as their default.
Click CONTINUE.
4. Add attribute mapping in GCP
In the next page, add the following attribute
First name → FirstName
Last name → LastName
Primary email → PrimaryEmail
Under the Group membership section, add all the groups of the users you want to be sent to OCI. Enter the App attribute MemberOf. Click FINISH.
5. Turn on User access in GCP
In the next page showing the SAML app details, click on User access
Switch to ON for everyone. Click SAVE.
6. Finish SAML app creation in OCI
Go back to the OCI page. We finished importing GCP's IdP metadata file. Click Next.
Change Requested Name ID format to Email address. Click Next and Create IdP.
7. Activate and add to IdP policy
Now we want to activate our newly-created IdP app and add it as an option to the login policy. Click the app.
Click on the Activate IdP button (under Actions or in the banner).
Next, we need to add the IdP app to the IdP policy. Go back to the Federation page and click on the Default Identity Provider Policy.
Under the Identity provider rules, edit the first IdP rule.
Add the newly-created IdP app to the list of Assign identity providers. Click Save changes.
Now you can login but without any groups.
8. Set up JIT
To enable the user's groups in GCP to appear in OCI and sync the user's group membership, we need to enable Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning so the group membership info can be shared from GCP to OCI.
Go back to the Federation page and click on the IdP app.
Click Actions > Configure JIT.
Enable these settings:
Enable Just-In-Time (JIT) provisioning
Create a new identity domain user
Update the existing identity domain user
Add these Map user attributes info:
IdP user attribute type
IdP user attribute name
Maps to
Identity domain user attributes
NameID
NameID value
→
User Name
Attribute
LastName
→
Last name
Attribute
PrimaryEmail
→
Primary Work Email
Attribute
FirstName
→
First name
Now, we assign group mappings. Enter the following values:
Group membership attribute name: MemberOf
Assign implicit group membership: Select this
When assigning group membership...: Merge with existing group memberships
When a group is not found...: Ignore the missing group
Click Update.
9. Verify Federated login
We are done! Now, we need to test the OCI login using GCP credentials.
Log out of OCI as necessary. Log in to your OCI account at https://cloud.oracle.com. You should see your GCP login option here.
Log in using that button, which should lead you to your GCP login, and your successful OCI login.
ℹ Troubleshoot: if the login is unsuccessful, check back the OCI JIT settings are correct.
We'll log out and log back in as the OCI admin so we can see all the groups and users added.
Here, we can see my GCP user added to the OCI list of users.
And I can see that new user is a member of the "odbg-db-family-administrators" group, which that user is in GCP. Note that while the user is also in the GCP group "example-group415", this group did not get transferred into OCI because that group was never created in OCI in the first place. The JIT only matches groups present in both OCI and GCP.
You now have successfully created an identity federation from GCP to OCI.
