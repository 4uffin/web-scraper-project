How to create an Oracle Autonomous Database@Google Cloud

Steps to provision a simple Oracle Autonomous Database@Google Cloud using a public offer
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) recently released a joint offering--a provisioning of an Oracle Cloud Database infrastructure (Autonomous Database and Exadata Infrastructure) in Google Cloud while leveraging OCI's database services and features. In this tutorial, we follow a limited deployment of an Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) in GCP through a public marketplace offering, also known as Pay As You Go.
1. Have a Google Cloud account
Be an editor to the current GCP project with billing rights. See Oracle Docs: Task 1: Prerequisites for Oracle Database@Google Cloud for full permissions.
2. Purchase an Oracle Database offer on GCP
In GCP > Marketplace, search for Oracle Database@Google Cloud. Click on it, choose the Pay as You Go option, and Subscribe. This process does not cost anything, but since Oracle has to manually approve of the order, the marketplace purchase process will take time.
3. Create a new OCI account through the Oracle Database offer
Once the offer has been successfully processed, GCP's Oracle Database@Google Cloud resource page will show an option to link the GCP project to an OCI tenancy account. Note that since we opted to purchase a public offering, we can only link the project to a new OCI account and not link to an existing one.
Oracle Database@Google Cloud resource page. A banner will show up to connect to an OCI account if you haven't done so already:
4. Create an ODB network
An ODB network in GCP is an virtual network that provides connectivity between Oracle Database@Google Cloud resources in the OCI child site within the GCP data center and your Google Cloud VPC network. It allows the Oracle Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) used to host the Oracle Databases to map back to the Google Cloud VPC. You will not find the ODB network listed in Google Cloud VPCs.
In GCP's Oracle Database@Google Cloud resource page, go to ODB network on the left menu and create an ODB network.
While you can use the default network, I chose to optionally opt to use my own VPC equipped with automatically-created subnets:
5. Create the client and backup ODB network subnets
After creating the ODB network, create the backup and client subnets for the database. An Autonomous Database needs a minimum of /27 CIDR size. See Oracle Docs: Plan for IP Address Space in Oracle Database@Google Cloud for more IP Address Space considerations.
Here, I simply opted to use 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 for the client and backup subnets respectively. Again, provisioning will take time.
6. Create Autonomous Database
Hooray! You're near the end! ðŸŽ‰
Go to the Autonomous Database menu selection and begin Create.
Fill out the details for the Autonomous Database. Note that only select regions are supported. See Oracle Docs: Regional Availability for Oracle Database@Google Cloud for supported regions.
I also make sure to include my personal IP so I can connect publicly to this POC database to prove it's working. Require mutual TLS is also nice to enable.
7. Verify database connection
Once done creating the database, you should be able to select that database and manage it in OCI by clicking on the Manage in OCI button.
Once clicked, you will log into your new OCI account and see the ADB details. Let us try to connect to it by clicking on the Database connection button and download the wallet.
Download connection wallet:
We will attempt to publicly connect to the ADB using Oracle SQL Developer.
Input your password for admin that you put during the creation process in GCP
Choose Cloud Wallet as your Connection Type
Choose the downloaded wallet as your Configuration File
Important: Select one of the public connection type services instead of the default private high type
Click Test and Connect.
Verify any SQL commands:
Next steps: RBAC IAM permissions
To maintain a strict user access management, we need groups and policy permissions. OCI automatically created some groups and policies to help you manage access to the database resources upon provisioning of the new tenancy. Assign users appropriately to the groups. See below for groups created:
These groups--except for some like odbaa-db-family-readers, odbg-exa-infra-readers for unclear reasons--align with the groups described here: Oracle Docs: Task 5: Set Up Role Based Access Control.
If you want to set up Identity Federation between GCP and OCI to enable GCP users to log into OCI using their GCP credentials, hop on to Dev.to: How to set up Identity Federation between Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud .
Closing
Now, obviously this tutorial is meant to give a high-level overview to a limited database service with easy permission levels. Feel free to look over the resources to learn more. Make sure to stop the ADB in GCP if you're not using it to save costs.
