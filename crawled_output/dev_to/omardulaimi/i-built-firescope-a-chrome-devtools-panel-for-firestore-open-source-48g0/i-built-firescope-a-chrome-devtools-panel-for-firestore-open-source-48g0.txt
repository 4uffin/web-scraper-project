I built FireScope: a Chrome DevTools panel for Firestore (open-source)

Hey folks üëã
I‚Äôve been using this little tool privately for about a year and finally shipped it: FireScope ‚Äî a Chrome DevTools panel for Firestore.
It watches your app‚Äôs Firestore traffic in real time, shows queries/params at a glance, and lets you export code (Angular/Node/Flutter/JSON). No setup ‚Äî install it and open DevTools ‚Üí FireScope.
Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/firescope/dpjiajgeckamnpncihnhldkehaghaffd
GitHub (open-source): https://github.com/omar-dulaimi/firescope
TL;DR
‚úÖ Live capture of Firestore requests (reads/writes/queries)
‚úÖ Clear details: method, path, params, body
‚úÖ One-click export to Angular / Node / Flutter / JSON
‚úÖ Collections view for quick navigation
‚úÖ Lives in Chrome DevTools ‚Üí FireScope
üß© Open-source ‚Äî feedback & PRs welcome
This fills a gap I kept hitting as a Firestore/Firebase dev: I want to see exactly what my app sends and quickly prototype the same call in code.
Who is it for?
You debug Firestore a lot and want a focused view (not the noisy Network tab).
You share reproducible snippets with teammates.
You like pasting a ready export and tweaking it.
Screenshots
Quick Start
Install from the Chrome Web Store.
Open your app and press F12 for DevTools.
Switch to the ‚ÄúFireScope‚Äù panel.
Interact with your app (reads/writes/queries).
Click any request for details or Export.
Not seeing anything? Trigger a Firestore action (load a page that reads data or press a button that writes).
What you can export
Angular (service-friendly snippets)
Node (server-side helpers)
Flutter (Dart snippets)
JSON (raw shape you can keep in docs/tests)
Exports are a starting point you paste and tweak.
Privacy
FireScope runs fully in your browser. It inspects your tab‚Äôs Firestore network activity via DevTools ‚Äî no servers, no tracking.
Troubleshooting
FireScope panel missing? Close/reopen DevTools, then reload the page.
Empty list? Perform an action that hits Firestore (read/write/query).
Still stuck? Open an issue on GitHub with a short repro.
Roadmap / Ideas
More export targets (React, Svelte, Next.js server actions, etc.)
Filters & search, pin a session
‚ÄúCopy as test‚Äù templates
Shortcuts and better empty states
Have an idea? Drop an issue on GitHub.

I‚Äôd love your thoughts. Try it on a real project, tell me what‚Äôs missing, and if you hit any rough edges, please open an issue. PRs are super welcome üôè
Thanks for reading!
