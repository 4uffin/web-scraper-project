Hey all,
I‚Äôve been working on a side project to make metro travel in India less confusing: RailMetro.com
.
The idea came from personal frustration‚Äîfinding the right line, interchanges, and fares across different metro networks was always a hassle.
Here‚Äôs what it currently does:
üöá Route finder with clear interchange info
üí∏ Accurate fare calculation before you travel
üìç Station details, line maps, and coverage for 18 Indian metro networks
‚ö° Lightweight and fast (kept it simple, no clutter)
Would love some feedback on:
Is the interface clear, or does it feel overwhelming?
Any features you‚Äôd like to see (e.g., live timings, exit gates, etc.)?
As a user, would you prefer web-only or a mobile app too?
This is still very much a side project, so I‚Äôm open to improving it based on feedback.
Thanks for checking it out! üôè
