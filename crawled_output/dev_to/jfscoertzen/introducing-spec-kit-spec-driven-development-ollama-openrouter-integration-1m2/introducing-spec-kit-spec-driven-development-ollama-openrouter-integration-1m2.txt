Introducing spec-kit: Spec-Driven Development + Ollama & OpenRouter Integration

Hey folks,
I‚Äôve been working on some enhancements to spec-kit
, and I‚Äôm excited to share them with you. These updates bring in CLI, Ollama, and OpenRouter support to supercharge spec-driven dev workflows.
üîç What is spec-kit?
Spec-kit is a toolkit for Spec-Driven Development, helping developers go from idea ‚Üí spec ‚Üí implementation with better alignment and iterative clarity.
It supports:
Multiple AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
Cross-stack / tech independence: not tied to one language or framework
Lightweight requirements (Python 3.11+, Git, Linux/macOS or WSL2 on Windows, and an AI agent)
‚ú® What I‚Äôve added
With my contributions, spec-kit now also allows:
CLI support: run spec-kit directly from the terminal
Ollama integration: use local LLMs as backend agents
OpenRouter support: connect to multiple hosted models with one interface
This means you can now choose fully local, fully cloud, or hybrid workflows.
üöÄ Core CLI Commands
Here are some of the most useful commands to try out:
Specify your project
speckit specify
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Use AI to flesh out your requirements and specs. This is where ideas become structured, testable specifications.
Generate a plan
speckit plan
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Automatically generate a high-level plan of implementation steps from your specs.
Break down into tasks
speckit tasks
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Turn your plan into actionable development tasks ‚Äî perfect for managing iterations and team work.
‚ö° Example with Ollama & OpenRouter
Run a spec using a local Ollama model
speckit specify "Write a todo list application" --ai ollama
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Or use OpenRouter to run via a hosted model
speckit plan "Tech Stack: Docker, MongoDB, React, Vite, NodeJS" --ai openrouter
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üí° Why this matters
Faster prototyping ‚Üí from raw idea to structured plan in minutes
Flexible model choice ‚Üí local (Ollama) or hosted (OpenRouter)
Better workflows ‚Üí specs drive planning and tasking, not just ad-hoc coding
üëÄ What‚Äôs next
I‚Äôd love feedback on:
Other LLM providers to support
How you‚Äôre using Ollama / OpenRouter in practice
Improvements for the CLI flow (esp. specify ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks pipeline)
Contributions and ideas are very welcome üôå
