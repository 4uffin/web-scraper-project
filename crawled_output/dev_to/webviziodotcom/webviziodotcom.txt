Our story
Over 1.5 million agencies, product, and development teams worldwide work under the pressure of missed deadlines. Most delays are caused by misunderstandings and miscommunication between non-technical stakeholders and web development teams. Traditional collaboration tools like documents, chats, and screenshots are not capable of providing first-hand visual /contextual feedback related to specific live web elements that need to be changed. That's why we created Webvizio.
