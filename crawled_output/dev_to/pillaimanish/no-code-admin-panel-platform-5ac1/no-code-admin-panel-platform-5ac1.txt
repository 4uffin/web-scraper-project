𝐍𝐨-𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐀𝐝𝐦𝐢𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐧𝐞𝐥 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦
𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬: Automates the creation of admin panels using a simple drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the need to build them from scratch for each client.
𝐁𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐝: Built entirely by me in GoLang.
𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝: The UI was generated with the help of AI.
𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
⇨ Creates tables with primary and foreign key relations.
⇨ Manages users and their access requests.
⇨ Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions on data.
𝐅𝐮𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐬: I'm working on adding customizable role-based permissions and improving the UI. I would be happy, if anyone wants to collab on frontend.
