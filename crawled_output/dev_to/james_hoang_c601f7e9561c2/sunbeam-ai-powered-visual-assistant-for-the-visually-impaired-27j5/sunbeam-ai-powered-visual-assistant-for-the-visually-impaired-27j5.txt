Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
Sunbeam is a revolutionary AI-powered visual assistant designed specifically for the 1.3 billion visually impaired people worldwide. Built as a voice-first web application, Sunbeam transforms any smartphone camera into intelligent eyes, enabling users to navigate and understand their environment through natural conversation with AI.
The app addresses critical daily challenges faced by visually impaired individuals:
Scene Understanding: Describing surroundings in real-time
Text Reading: OCR for menus, signs, labels, and documents
Object Detection: Identifying and locating items with precision
People Finding: Locating people nearby with spatial guidance
Currency Recognition: Identifying money and denominations
Color Detection: Determining colors at fingertip precision
Document Analysis: Processing PDFs, Word documents, and images
Conversational AI: Natural dialogue about the environment
Sunbeam goes beyond basic accessibility tools by providing a humanized AI companion named "Sunbeam" that offers warm, supportive interaction rather than robotic responses. The app features sophisticated haptic feedback patterns, voice-first navigation, and enterprise-grade accessibility compliance.

How I Used Google AI Studio
Sunbeam is built entirely on Google AI Studio's Gemini ecosystem, leveraging multiple cutting-edge capabilities:
Core Integration:
Gemini 2.5 Flash API via @google/genai package
Structured Output: JSON Schema implement action for consistent AI responses
Custom System Instructions: "Sunbeam" personality with accessibility-focused prompting
Google AI Studio Features Utilized:
Multimodal Content Understanding for image, text, and audio processing
Real-time Streaming for conversational mode
Context-Aware Responses with conversation memory
Safety Controls for user protection and appropriate guidance
Multimodal Features
Sunbeam showcases comprehensive multimodal AI capabilities across three primary domains:
🖼️ Visual Intelligence
Scene Analysis: Gemini processes camera feeds to describe environments with contextual detail
Object Detection: Real-time identification with normalized bounding box coordinates
Text Recognition (OCR): Extraction and reading of text from images, documents, and signage
Document Processing: Multi-format analysis supporting JPEG, PNG, PDF, and DOCX files
Color Recognition: Pixel-level color analysis with mathematical precision using Euclidean distance algorithms
🎤 Audio Intelligence
Speech Recognition: Web Speech API integration for natural voice commands
Text-to-Speech: Custom audio synthesis with Web Audio API
Voice Commands: "Hey Sunbeam" wake word with intelligent timeout management
Conversational AI: Real-time streaming chat with spatial awareness
Audio Feedback: Sophisticated haptic patterns (tap, success, error) designed like musical notes
🧠 Cross-Modal Intelligence
Spatial Awareness: Visual object detection → Audio spatial guidance ("to your right", "very close")
Context Preservation: Visual analysis informs conversational responses
Multi-Input Processing: Simultaneous camera, voice, and file input handling
Real-time Coordination: Background process management ensuring smooth multimodal experience
Enhanced User Experience Through Multimodality:
1. Independence Enablement: Users can navigate environments hands-free using voice while receiving rich visual information through audio
2. Natural Interaction: Combines visual AI understanding with conversational dialogue, mimicking human assistance
3. Accessibility Excellence: Voice-first design eliminates visual interface dependency while maintaining visual feedback for sighted companions
4. Emotional Connection: "Sunbeam" AI personality creates supportive, warm interactions rather than clinical tool usage
Impact Statement
Sunbeam represents more than technological achievement—it's a bridge to independence for millions of visually impaired individuals worldwide. By combining Google AI Studio's powerful multimodal capabilities with accessibility-first design, I've created a solution that doesn't just process information but transforms lives through empowering technology.
Built with ❤️ for accessibility
