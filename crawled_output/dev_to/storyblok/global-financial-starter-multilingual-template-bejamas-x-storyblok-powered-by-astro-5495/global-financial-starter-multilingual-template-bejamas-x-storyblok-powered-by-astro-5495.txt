Exciting news for Astro and Storyblok fans! With our friends at Bejamas, weâ€™ve launched the Global Financial Starter: Multilingual Template, a production-ready Astro and Storyblok project that delivers fast, compliant, and global online presence for international sites.
Whether you're a frontend team, an agency, or a solo developer, this starter is designed to help you spin up multilingual websites for financial brands, campaigns, or products.
Storyblok and Bejamas share the same missionâ€“to make it easier for developers to launch global digital experiences without compromising performance and flexibility. This starter is the result of one such partnership. It's not just a showcase, but a project you can clone, adapt, and ship to production.

The Global Financial Starter is built with a modern, headless stack designed for performance, scalability, and ease of use: Astro, Storyblok, Netlify, and PostHog.

Multilingual by default â€“ built-in language switcher with optional AI-assisted translations.
Visual editing â€“ live preview with Storyblokâ€™s block-based approach.
SEO ready â€“ every page includes metadata fields.
Optimized performance â€“ responsive images, static output, and https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-astro-storyblok-finance-starter-netlify-app/41ym06mwtn?form_factor=desktop.
A/B testing â€“ PostHog integration to run experiments and A/B tests without extra setup.
