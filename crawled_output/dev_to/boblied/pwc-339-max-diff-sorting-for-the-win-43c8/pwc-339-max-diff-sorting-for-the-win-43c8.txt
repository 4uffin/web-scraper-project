PWC 339 Max Diff: Sorting for the win
#perl
#perlweeklychallenge
#pwc
This week's task turned out to be one of those that are easy to state and more challenging to do efficiently. Let's look at it.
Task 1: Max Diff
You are given an array of integers having four
or more elements. Write a script to find two
pairs of numbers from this list (four numbers
total) so that the difference between their
products is as large as possible. In the end,
return the max difference. With Two pairs
(a, b) and (c, d), the product difference is
(a * b) - (c * d).

Example 1:
Input: @ints = (5, 9, 3, 4, 6)
Output: 42
Pair 1: (9, 6)
Pair 2: (3, 4)
Product Diff: (9 * 6) - (3 * 4) => 54 - 12 => 42
Example 2:
Input: @ints = (1, -2, 3, -4)
Output: 10
Pair 1: (1, -2) Pair 2: (3, -4)
Example 3:
Input: @ints = (-3, -1, -2, -4)
Output: 10
Pair 1: (-1, -2) Pair 2: (-3, -4)
Example 4:
Input: @ints = (10, 2, 0, 5, 1)
Output: 50
Pair 1: (10, 5) Pair 2: (0, 1)
Example 5:
Input: @ints = (7, 8, 9, 10, 10)
Output: 44
Pair 1: (10, 10) Pair 2: (7, 8)
Thought processes
Using the canard that developer time is more valuable than computer time, we might go after this through brute force. We'll need to examine every combination of four elements from the array. I can foresee that that could have horrible performance implications -- it's O(n4) if we do it with nested loops. But let's try it anyway.
sub maxDiff_BF(@int)
{
my $max = 0;
for my $w ( 0 .. $#int ) {
for my $x ( 0 .. $#int ) {
next if $x == $w;
for my $y ( 0 .. $#int ) {
next if $y == $x || $y == $w;
for my $z ( 0
.. $#int ) {
next if $z == $y || $z == $x || $z == $w;
my ($a, $b, $c, $d) = @int[$w,$x,$y,$z];
my $diff = max( $a*$b - $c*$d, $c*$d - $a*$b );
$max = $diff if $diff > $max;
}
}
}
}
return $max;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Notes:
next if $x == $w -- At the start of each loop, we can't reuse elements.
my ($a, $b, $c, $d) = @int[$w,$x,$y,$z] -- Use an array slice to access four elements at a time and translate the variables to the language of the problem.
More thought process
As expected, the performance is awful. It doesn't show on the simple examples, but give this a list of 75 numbers and my laptop has to chug along for 12 to 15 seconds to get an answer. With AI data centers devouring the world's electric capacity, I don't want to be a contributor to the coming collapse of the grid.
One thing I notice quickly is that I want a maximal product magnitude, which I'm going to get by multiplying the two largest elements of the array. If that product is negative, I'll make it the (c,d) pair, so it gets added to the difference.
How can I quickly get the largest elements? Well, if the array were sorted, then the biggest magnitudes would be at the ends of the arrays (left end for negative numbers, right end for positives). Then the biggest product would be achieved by multiplying either the two most negative numbers, the two most positive numbers, or the biggest negative times the biggest positive.
After I have the biggest possible contribution, then I'll want to throw out the pair of numbers that we used, and examine the rest for the other product. We'll get back to that in moment, but let's do the first part.
sub maxDiff(@int)
{
@int = sort { $a <=> $b } @int;
my $nn = $int[ 0] * $int[ 1];
my $pp = $int[-1] * $int[-2];
my $np = $int[ 0] * $int[-1];
my $largest;
if ( abs($nn) > abs($pp) ) {
if ( abs($nn) > abs($np) ) {
$largest = $nn;
shift @int; shift @int;
} else {
$largest = $np;
shift @int; pop @int;
}
}
else { # pp >= nn
if ( abs($pp) > abs($np) ) {
$largest = $pp;
pop @int; pop @int;
} else {
$largest = $np;
shift @int; pop @int;
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
That's an annoying number of lines of code, but hopefully clear. After we determine which of the three possibilities applies, we delete the elements from the left (shift) or right (pop) to work on the rest. Sorting probably costs us O(n log n), but that's way better than O(n4).
Now we have two possibilities.
If $largest is negative, then we want to make it the (c,d) pair, so that subtracting it adds a big number to the difference. And we also want the (a,b) pair to be as big as possible so that (ab-cd) is as large as possible. The biggest product is once again found by multiplying the biggest numbers on the
ends of the array (which now excludes the two numbers we already used).
if ( $largest < 0 )
{
my $aXb = max( $int[0]*$int[1], $int[0]*$int[-1], $int[-2]*$int[-1] );
return $aXb - $largest;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What about the case that $largest is positive? In that case we'll want to subtract away the smallest possible positive product.
One way to find it is to examine every pair. Straightforward, but once again we're looking at a less desirable complexity of O(n2). It's easy enough to write, though.
my $cXd = $int[0] * $int[1];
while ( defined(my $c = shift @int) )
{
for my $d ( @int )
{
my $prod = $c * $d;
$cXd = $prod if ( $prod >= 0 && $prod < $cXd );
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
But what if we could play the same trick we did the first time? Could
we sort the list to put the small numbers at the ends of the array? Yes, we could. We can sort by the inverse of the numbers.
@int = sort { ($a == 0 ? 2 : 1/$a) <=> ($b == 0 ? 2 : 1/$b) } @int;
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
A larger denominator moves closer to 0, and a bigger one moves closer to 1. There is an anomaly for 0, which would cause a divide-by-zero error. To solve that, map 0 to the extreme end of the array so that it always ends up on the right end. We're exploiting the specification that says the list contains integers; if there were fractional numbers in the input, we'd have an annoying complication to explicitly account for zero to put it on the end of the array.
# Sort (-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4):
# -1/1
-1/2
-1/3
-1/4
1/4
1/3
1/2
1/1 2(0)
# --|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|---|
# --> (-1, -2, -3, -4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)

For the price of another sort, we can now find the smallest product in constant time:
my $cXd = min( $int[0]*$int[1], $int[0]*$int[-1], $int[-2]*$int[-1] );
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
and the maximum difference in this case is just $largest - $cXd.
Final thoughts
One alternative we didn't consider is that there are ways to cheaply generate the combinations of n things taken k at a time. The Algorithm::Combinatorics module has one such function. Still, to consider all the combinations, that becomes a lot very quickly (75 things taken 4 at a time has 75!/(71!)(4!) = 7,292,700 combinations).
By rearranging the data to put extreme values on the ends of the array, we can access those values in constant time. Perl makes it easy to access either end of the array, using negative indexes. The cost is sorting the array twice, with each sort having a most likely complexity of O(n log n). Two of those is still (on average) much more efficient than a stack of nested loops.
All the code fragments above combined into a coherent function:
sub maxDiff(@int)
{
@int = sort { $a <=> $b } @int;
# Possibilities for maximum product: biggest positive numbers, biggest
# negative numbers, or biggest positive X biggest negative.
# Find the biggest magnitude, then discard that pair from the list.
my $nn = $int[0] * $int[1];
my $pp = $int[-1] * $int[-2];
my $np = $int[0] * $int[-1];
my $largest;
if ( abs($nn) > abs($pp) )
{
if ( abs($nn) > abs($np) )
{
$largest = $nn;
shift @int; shift @int;
}
else
{
$largest = $np;
shift @int; pop @int;
}
}
else # pp >= nn
{
if ( abs($pp) > abs($np) )
{
$largest = $pp;
pop @int; pop @int;
}
else
{
$largest = $np;
shift @int; pop @int;
}
}
if ( $largest < 0 )
{
# Make it the second pair (because negating it will add a big number),
# and find the largest product for the first pair. Again, because the
# list is sorted, the largest magnitude must come from the pairs on
# the ends of the list.
my $aXb = max( $int[0]*$int[1], $int[0]*$int[-1], $int[-2]*$int[-1] );
return $aXb - $largest;
}
# Use largest as the first pair for maximum positive contribution.
# Find the smallest product pair to subtract away.
