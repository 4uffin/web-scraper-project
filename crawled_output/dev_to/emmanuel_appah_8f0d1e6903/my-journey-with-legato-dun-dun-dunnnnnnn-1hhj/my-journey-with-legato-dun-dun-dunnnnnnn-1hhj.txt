The Spark: Why Stories Need Better Protection
It started with a conversation. I was talking to a friend who's a talented writer from Nigeria, and she told me about how she'd been writing stories online for years but had no way to protect her work or get fairly compensated when her stories went viral. She'd seen her work shared across platforms without attribution, and when a small production company reached out about adapting one of her stories, she had no legal framework to negotiate a fair deal.
That's when it hit me: we need a platform where stories become intellectual property, not just content.
The more I researched, the more I realized this wasn't just her problem. Writers across Africa, MENA, and the Global South were creating incredible content but lacked the infrastructure to protect and monetize their work. Existing platforms like Wattpad focus on community and discovery, while Webnovel emphasizes monetization, but none prioritize IP protection and licensing opportunities.
So I decided to build Legato - a platform where stories become IP, and writers get paid fairly. But here's the twist: I didn't build it alone. I partnered with Kiro, an AI development assistant, to turn this ambitious vision into reality.
The Vision: More Than Just Another Writing Platform
Legato isn't trying to be another Wattpad clone. Our mission is fundamentally different:
IP-First Approach: Every story published gets automatic copyright protection with digital fingerprints
Global Reach: Instant translation to break down language barriers
Fair Monetization: Multiple revenue streams with writers keeping majority ownership
Licensing Marketplace: Direct connections between writers and studios/publishers
Mobile-First: Designed for the smartphone-dominant markets we're targeting
The goal? Create a sustainable ecosystem where great stories can find their way to global audiences and adaptations, regardless of where they originate.
The AI-Assisted Development Journey
Why I Chose Kiro as My Development Partner
Building a platform like Legato is incredibly complex - you need frontend expertise, backend architecture, database design, authentication systems, and so much more. As a solo developer, I knew I needed help, but hiring a full team wasn't feasible at this stage.
That's where Kiro came in. Kiro isn't just another code generator - it's an AI assistant that understands software architecture, can reason about complex problems, and helps you build production-ready applications. Working with Kiro felt like having an experienced senior developer as a pair programming partner.
The Development Process: Human Vision + AI Execution
Here's how we approached building Legato:
1. I provided the vision and requirements
The business problem we're solving
User stories and feature requirements
Technical constraints and goals
2. Kiro helped architect the solution
Suggested microservices architecture for scalability
Recommended tech stack (Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL)
Designed database schemas and API structures
Planned authentication and security systems
3. We built iteratively together
I'd describe what I wanted to achieve
Kiro would implement the code and explain the decisions
We'd test, debug, and refine together
Kiro helped me understand best practices and potential issues
The Authentication Challenge: Where AI Really Shined
Authentication was one of our biggest challenges. Not because it's conceptually difficult, but because getting it right across a distributed system with a React frontend is incredibly tricky.
The Challenge:
JWT tokens need to be securely stored and automatically refreshed
Multiple services need to validate tokens
Frontend needs to handle authentication state across page refreshes
Mobile users might have spotty connections
How Kiro Helped:
When I explained the authentication requirements, Kiro immediately understood the complexity and suggested a sophisticated token management system. What would have taken me weeks to research and implement, Kiro helped me build in hours:
Key Features Kiro Implemented:
Automatic token refresh: Happens transparently before requests
Concurrent request handling: Multiple requests don't trigger multiple refresh attempts
Secure storage: Tokens stored properly with cleanup mechanisms
Cross-tab synchronization: Logout in one tab logs out all tabs
Error handling: Graceful degradation when auth services are unavailable
The beauty of working with Kiro is that it doesn't just write code - it explains the reasoning behind architectural decisions and helps you understand the trade-offs.
Mobile-First Development: AI Understanding User Needs
One thing that impressed me about Kiro was how well it understood the mobile-first requirements when I explained our target markets. It immediately suggested optimizations that I hadn't even thought of:
Performance Optimizations Kiro Suggested:
Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial loads
Image optimization strategies for slow networks
Offline capabilities for reading downloaded content
Progressive loading patterns
User Experience Insights:
Touch-friendly interfaces with proper tap targets
Navigation patterns optimized for thumb usage
Loading states that work well on slow connections
Error handling that makes sense to mobile users
Kiro helped me understand that building for emerging markets isn't just about responsive design - it's about fundamentally different user behaviors and constraints.
The Frontend: Learning React Architecture with AI
State Management Decisions
When I asked Kiro about state management, it didn't just suggest Redux like many tutorials do. Instead, it analyzed our specific needs and recommended a more nuanced approach:
Kiro's State Strategy:
Server State: React Query for all API data and caching
Client State: React Context for authentication and global UI state
Form State: React Hook Form for complex forms with validation
URL State: Next.js router for navigation and shareable state
This approach kept our codebase simple while using the right tool for each type of state.
Component Architecture Insights
Kiro helped me organize the frontend in a way that would scale. Instead of the typical "components by type" approach, it suggested organizing by feature and user flow, which made the codebase much more maintainable as we added new features.
Key Principles Kiro Taught Me:
Composition over inheritance: Build small, focused components
Accessibility first: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
Performance conscious: Smart memoization without premature optimization
Mobile considerations: Touch targets and gesture handling
The Authentication Context: AI-Designed Patterns
One of the most complex parts was managing authentication state across the entire app. Kiro designed an elegant solution that handles all the edge cases I wouldn't have thought of:
Automatic token refresh without user interruption
Role-based redirects after login (readers vs writers vs studios)
Email verification flows with proper user feedback
Cross-tab synchronization for logout events
Loading states that prevent UI flicker
The authentication context Kiro built provides a clean API for the entire app while handling all the complexity behind the scenes. It even includes proper TypeScript types and error handling patterns.
The Backend: AI-Architected Microservices
Technology Choices with AI Guidance
When I explained our requirements to Kiro, it recommended FastAPI for the backend services with solid reasoning:
Performance: Comparable to Node.js and Go for our use case
Type Safety: Automatic validation with Pydantic models
Documentation: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs for frontend integration
Async Support: Perfect for handling multiple concurrent users
Database Design: AI Understanding Domain Models
Kiro helped me design a database schema that balances normalization with performance. It understood the unique requirements of a storytelling platform:
Smart Design Decisions Kiro Made:
Soft deletes: Never actually delete user content (crucial for IP protection)
Audit trails: Track all changes for copyright verification
Strategic denormalization: Optimize for read-heavy workloads
Proper indexing: Based on actual query patterns, not just theory
The schema Kiro designed handles complex relationships like story hierarchies, user roles, and community interactions while maintaining data integrity.
API Design: Pragmatic REST with AI Insights
Kiro helped me design APIs that are RESTful where it makes sense, but pragmatic for complex operations. It understood that strict REST isn't always the best approach for user experience.
Kiro's API Design Principles:
Consistent error formats across all services
Proper HTTP status codes that frontend can rely on
Request IDs for debugging distributed systems
Comprehensive validation with clear error messages
Optimized endpoints for mobile clients (fewer round trips)
The APIs Kiro designed are easy to consume from the frontend and provide excellent developer experience with auto-generated documentation.
The Hardest Problems: Where AI Partnership Shined
1. Token Refresh Race Conditions
The Problem: Multiple API calls happening simultaneously when a token expires could trigger multiple refresh attempts, causing chaos.
Kiro's Solution: When I described this issue, Kiro immediately understood the concurrency problem and implemented a promise-based refresh mechanism that ensures only one refresh happens at a time. It even explained why this pattern works and what edge cases it handles.
2. Cross-Service Data Consistency
The Problem: When a user updates their profile, multiple services need to know about it without creating tight coupling.
Kiro's Approach: Suggested an event-driven architecture that keeps services loosely coupled while maintaining data consistency. It designed the event patterns and helped me understand when to use events vs direct API calls.
3. Mobile Performance Optimization
The Problem: Initial page loads were too slow for users on 2G/3G connections in our target markets.
Kiro's Strategy: Developed an aggressive optimization approach:
Smart code splitting based on user flows
Image optimization with multiple format support
Progressive loading that prioritizes critical content
Caching strategies that work well on unreliable networks
What impressed me most was how Kiro understood the constraints of emerging markets and suggested optimizations I wouldn't have thought of.
Lessons Learned: The AI Development Experience
1. AI Catches What You Miss
Working with Kiro taught me that AI can catch issues I would have missed. For example, when we were building the authentication system, Kiro proactively suggested edge cases like:
What happens when a user's session expires mid-request?
How do we handle token refresh failures gracefully?
What about users who disable JavaScript?
These aren't things I would have thought of until they became problems in production.
2. AI Understands Context Better Than Expected
One thing that surprised me was how well Kiro understood the business context. When I mentioned we're targeting emerging markets, it immediately adjusted its suggestions:
Optimized for slower networks
Considered offline-first approaches
Suggested progressive enhancement patterns
Recommended mobile-first design principles
3. The Learning Accelerator Effect
Building with Kiro wasn't just faster - it was educational. Every piece of code came with explanations of why certain patterns were chosen, what trade-offs were being made, and what to watch out for. It's like having a senior developer mentor who never gets tired of explaining things.
4. AI Handles the Boring Stuff
Kiro excelled at the repetitive, error-prone tasks that developers hate:
Setting up proper error handling patterns
Writing comprehensive input validation
Creating consistent API response formats
Implementing proper logging and monitoring
This freed me up to focus on the creative problem-solving and business logic.

Reflections: Why This Matters
Building Legato has been more than just a technical challenge - it's been about creating something that can genuinely impact people's lives. Every line of code we write is in service of helping writers build sustainable creative careers while maintaining ownership of their work.
The technical challenges were significant, but they pale in comparison to the potential impact. If we can help even a handful of writers turn their stories into sustainable income streams, or help a single story find its way from a smartphone in Lagos to a Netflix series, then every late night debugging session will have been worth it.
The bigger picture: We're not just building a platform - we're building infrastructure for the future of global storytelling. In a world where content is increasingly valuable, writers deserve tools that help them protect and monetize their intellectual property fairly.
For Fellow Developers: AI-Assisted Development Tips
If you're considering AI-assisted development, here are my key takeaways:
Working with AI Effectively:
Be specific about your requirements - The more context you provide, the better the AI can help
Ask for explanations - Don't just take the code, understand the reasoning
Iterate together - Treat it like pair programming, not code generation
Focus on architecture first - Get the big picture right before diving into details
What AI Excels At:
Boilerplate and patterns - Authentication, API setup, database schemas
Best practices - Security patterns, error handling, performance optimization
Edge case handling - Things you might forget in the initial implementation
Code organization - Structuring projects for maintainability and scale
