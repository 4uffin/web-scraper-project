Notifuse: modern & free alternative to Mailchimp/Resend
#showdev

Hello DEV community,
Today I'm pleased to announce the launch of a modern & opensource alternative to Mailchimp/Resend to send newsletters & transactional API üéâ
üëâ View the Live Demo
üëâ View the Github project
The Notifuse idea started in 2016 as a SaaS and has been cloned by competitors many times... but it never really took off because guess what?
Developers don't like to pay for tech stuff.
Thanks to AI acceleration I've been able to build a brand new platform in few months, fully open-source, with modern features:
Drag'n drop email builder with MJML+Liquid engine demo here
S3 file manager
A/B testing for newsletters
Open/click tracking
Notification center
Why?
I believe it's a matter of months before every closed-source SaaS gets an AI-generated clone.
In the emailing/newsletter landscape the best open-source products are already outdated (Mautic, Listmonk, Sendportal, BillionMail...).
Differences?
The core value of an emailing platform is it's email editor & deliverability.
It's insanely difficult to build beautiful emails that look same in every client (outlook, iOS...).
For that reason existing open-source projects never bothered to create a state-of-the-art drag'n drop visual email editor.
Notifuse brings a modern email builder, built on top of MJML spec for clients compatibility & Liquid engine for customization.
Deliverability is guaranted by ESP integrations (AmazonSES, SparkPost, Mailgun, STMP, Postmark, Postal...) with Delivery/Bounce/Complaint webhooks handled.
For what?
As a dev, you can update your transactional email templates from the Notifuse UI and send emails with a line of code
Every growing project needs to send newsletters at some point... you will be glad to send a broadcast in a click
It's free & open-source
Your data stays at home

Looks great! Does anyone here use it in production yet? Curious how it holds up with larger mailing lists or more complex campaigns.

Hi @roshansharmaa , as far as I know from the Github discussions, it's used in production by an agency that created a workspace per client (github.com/spollacs). You can battle-test Notifuse with a Mailpit SMTP provider and import millions of emails in it! (that's what I did for testing)
