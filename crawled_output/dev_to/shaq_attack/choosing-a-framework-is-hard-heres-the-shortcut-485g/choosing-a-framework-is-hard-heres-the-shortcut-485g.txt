Choosing a Framework is Hard‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs the Shortcut
#beginners
#webdev
#frameworks
#programming
This isn‚Äôt our next official episode of The Stack Unpacked (that one‚Äôs about TypeScript), but let‚Äôs call this a filler episode ‚Äî the kind that doesn‚Äôt quite fit in the timeline, but covers a question I think every dev eventually faces:
‚ÄúWhich framework should I use for my next project?‚Äù
If you‚Äôve ever opened VS Code, stared at a blank project folder, and then spent weeks comparing React vs Vue vs Svelte instead of actually coding‚Ä¶ well, you‚Äôre not alone. (Confession: I‚Äôve been there. More than once.)
So today, we‚Äôre unpacking the big players ‚Äî React, Vue, Angular, Next.js ‚Äî plus some of the newer kids on the block: Svelte, SolidJS, and Astro.
The goal isn‚Äôt to crown a winner, but to help you figure out when each makes sense and whether you should stick to one or keep switching.
Why Frameworks Exist
Before we dive into names and logos, let‚Äôs rewind.
Plain JavaScript (a.k.a. Vanilla JS) can build anything. But as apps grew, developers found themselves tangled in state management, DOM updates, and reusable UI logic.
Frameworks were the answer: opinionated tools that provided structure, solved cross-browser headaches, and made big apps maintainable.
Think of them as power tools for the web:
You could build a house with a hammer, nails, and patience.
Or you could grab a nail gun and save yourself weeks of frustration.
The Big Four (and Beyond)
React ‚Äî The Industry Titan
Created by: Facebook (2013)
Philosophy: UI as a function of state. Build small components, wire them together, and let React handle re-rendering.
Ecosystem: Massive. Tutorials, job listings, libraries ‚Äî everywhere.
// React Hello World
import { useState } from "react";
function App() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
return (
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
Clicked {count} times
</button>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Strengths:
Dominates the industry ‚Üí more jobs and community support.
Huge ecosystem (Next.js, React Native, Remix).
Flexible: bring your own tools.
Weaknesses:
‚ÄúBring your own tools‚Äù can also mean decision fatigue.
Learning curve around hooks, state, and effects.
üëâ Anecdote: The first time I discovered useEffect, I thought I‚Äôd found a magic wand that could summon components and variables whenever I wanted. Spoiler: if you don‚Äôt manage those carefully, you‚Äôll summon endless popups until your browser begs for mercy.
Vue ‚Äî The Friendly One
Created by: Evan You (2014)
Philosophy: Approachability first. ‚ÄúProgressive framework‚Äù ‚Äî you can sprinkle it into a project or build a full SPA.
<!-- Vue Hello World -->
<template>
<button @click="count++">Clicked {{ count }} times</button>
</template>
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Strengths:
Beginner-friendly syntax (template + script + style).
Great docs, small learning curve.
Strong adoption in Asia and among indie devs.
Weaknesses:
Smaller job market compared to React.
Ecosystem is growing, but less sprawling than React‚Äôs.
Angular ‚Äî The Enterprise Giant
Created by: Google (2010, rewritten in 2016 as Angular 2+)
Philosophy: Full framework. Batteries included: routing, state, forms, HTTP.
// Angular Hello World Component
@Component({
selector: 'app-root',
template: `<button (click)="count++">Clicked {{ count }} times</button>`
})
export class AppComponent {
count = 0;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Strengths:
Complete solution ‚Üí no need to glue together libraries.
TypeScript-first ‚Üí safer for big codebases.
Popular in large, enterprise teams.
Weaknesses:
Heavy learning curve.
Verbose compared to others.
Less popular with startups and small teams.
Next.js ‚Äî React with Superpowers
Created by: Vercel (2016)
Philosophy: Build fast, production-ready apps with React. Provides routing, SSR, API routes.
// Next.js page (pages/index.js)
export default function Home() {
return <h1>Hello from Next.js</h1>
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Strengths:
Solves React‚Äôs missing pieces (routing, SSR).
SEO-friendly with server-side rendering.
Backed by Vercel, growing fast.
Weaknesses:
Tied to React ‚Üí inherits React‚Äôs quirks.
Can feel ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for tiny projects.
Svelte ‚Äî The Compiler Approach
Created by: Rich Harris (2016)
Philosophy: Write less code. Svelte compiles templates into optimized JS at build time.
<!-- Svelte Hello World -->
<script>
let count = 0;
</script>
<button on:click={() => count++}>
Clicked {count} times
</button>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Strengths:
Minimal boilerplate ‚Üí smaller code.
Fast performance.
Joyful developer experience.
Weaknesses:
Smaller ecosystem than React/Vue.
Still maturing ‚Äî fewer enterprise adopters.
SolidJS ‚Äî React, Refined
Created by: Ryan Carniato (2020)
Philosophy: React-like API with fine-grained reactivity (no VDOM overhead).
Strengths:
React familiarity without some of React‚Äôs inefficiencies.
Blazing performance benchmarks.
Weaknesses:
Young ecosystem.
Fewer tutorials, smaller community.
Astro ‚Äî For Content-Heavy Sites
Created by: Fred K. Schott & open-source contributors (2021)
Philosophy: Content-focused, partial hydration (ship less JavaScript). Great for blogs, docs, marketing sites.
Strengths:
Lightning-fast static sites.
Can mix-and-match React/Vue/Svelte components.
Weaknesses:
Not meant for complex apps.
Still finding its place in the ecosystem.
How to Choose ‚Äî A Use Case Guide
Here‚Äôs a way to think about it:
Learning & Jobs: Start with React (industry standard).
Quick Prototypes / Simplicity: Try Vue or Svelte.
Enterprise / Big Teams: Angular (structure + TypeScript).
SEO & Fullstack React: Next.js.
Cutting-Edge / Performance: SolidJS.
Content Sites / Blogs: Astro.
üëâ Anecdote: Honestly, I‚Äôve spent weeks choosing a framework before even starting a side project. That‚Äôs half the reason I‚Äôm writing this: so you can spend less time comparing, and more time actually coding.
Recap
Frameworks exist because vanilla JS gets messy fast. Each framework offers a trade-off: React‚Äôs ecosystem, Vue‚Äôs simplicity, Angular‚Äôs structure, Next.js‚Äôs power, Svelte‚Äôs joy, Solid‚Äôs speed, Astro‚Äôs focus.
There isn‚Äôt a single right answer. The ‚Äúbest‚Äù framework depends on what you‚Äôre building, your team, and your goals.
Outro
So here‚Äôs the real question:
Should you master one framework deeply, or switch based on the project?
Beginners ‚Äî what framework are you learning first, and why?
Seasoned devs ‚Äî what‚Äôs your rule of thumb when picking frameworks?
Drop your thoughts below. Your experience could save someone else from framework paralysis.

Thank you for sharing this post!
I found it very clear and easy to follow.
I'm currently learning React as my first frontend framework since it's used in so many projects.
It's challenging, but the strong community support has been a big help.
