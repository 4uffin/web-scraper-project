EventHub â€” A KendoReact-Powered Event Booking Platform

This is my submission for the KendoReact Free Components Challenge.
What I Built
Meet EventHub â€” a modern event booking platform built with React + TypeScript + Vite, powered end-to-end by KendoReact.
This is meant to be your one-stop shop for concerts, theater, comedy nights, or festivals: browse, filter, and book tickets with a clean 3-step flow. On the flip side, organizers get a no-fuss admin dashboard to manage their events.
The real star here is KendoReact. It gave me a consistent, accessible, production-ready UI without reinventing the wheel.
Problems It Solves
For users: makes discovering and booking events painless with rich client-side filters (date, location, genre).
For organizers: provides a dashboard for creating and scheduling events.
For the challenge: shows how KendoReact can scale into a full-featured app without losing polish or accessibility.
KendoReact Components Used
This app uses 10+ KendoReact components (free + licensed). Hereâ€™s a quick look:
AppBar / Drawer / PanelBar â€” navigation, mobile drawer, and admin sidebar
Data Grid â€” event management and bookings list
Card / TileLayout â€” event previews and Featured events
DatePicker / Calendar â€” date filtering and scheduling
DropDownList / MultiSelect / ComboBox â€” categories, locations, and forms
TextBox / NumericTextBox / MaskedTextBox â€” booking and event forms
Stepper â€” booking flow (Select â†’ Details â†’ Confirm)
Dialog â€” confirmations, create/edit events
Notification â€” success/error alerts (ARIA live regions)
TabStrip / ExpansionPanel â€” event details (Overview, Lineup, Venue)
ProgressBar / Badge / Tooltip / Avatar / Icons â€” polish and status UI
Charts (Pie) â€” event category breakdown
