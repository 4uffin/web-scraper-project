EventHub — A KendoReact-Powered Event Booking Platform

This is my submission for the KendoReact Free Components Challenge.
What I Built
Meet EventHub — a modern event booking platform built with React + TypeScript + Vite, powered end-to-end by KendoReact.
This is meant to be your one-stop shop for concerts, theater, comedy nights, or festivals: browse, filter, and book tickets with a clean 3-step flow. On the flip side, organizers get a no-fuss admin dashboard to manage their events.
The real star here is KendoReact. It gave me a consistent, accessible, production-ready UI without reinventing the wheel.
Problems It Solves
For users: makes discovering and booking events painless with rich client-side filters (date, location, genre).
For organizers: provides a dashboard for creating and scheduling events.
For the challenge: shows how KendoReact can scale into a full-featured app without losing polish or accessibility.
KendoReact Components Used
This app uses 10+ KendoReact components (free + licensed). Here’s a quick look:
AppBar / Drawer / PanelBar — navigation, mobile drawer, and admin sidebar
Data Grid — event management and bookings list
Card / TileLayout — event previews and Featured events
DatePicker / Calendar — date filtering and scheduling
DropDownList / MultiSelect / ComboBox — categories, locations, and forms
TextBox / NumericTextBox / MaskedTextBox — booking and event forms
Stepper — booking flow (Select → Details → Confirm)
Dialog — confirmations, create/edit events
Notification — success/error alerts (ARIA live regions)
TabStrip / ExpansionPanel — event details (Overview, Lineup, Venue)
ProgressBar / Badge / Tooltip / Avatar / Icons — polish and status UI
Charts (Pie) — event category breakdown
