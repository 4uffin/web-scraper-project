Skills/Languages
Specializing in distributed backend systems.
I aim to raise the bar by helping promote good coding habits and trying out new things.
Currently learning
Like everyone else on the planet, me and GPT started a project. But he's not the best coder so we became a 3 way with Copilot. Gemini felt left out though, so he's on board now too.
Currently hacking on
Building quirky AI tools, writing agent workflows, and turning wild ideas into experiments. If it’s AI + dev, I’m probably knee-deep in it (and blogging the chaos).
Available for
I'm always open for a great debate or happy to be your sounding board. I can be your cheerleader or devils advocate,
and am often both.
