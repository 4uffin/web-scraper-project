Automating Website Deployment on AWS Using Terraform
#terraform
#aws
#devops
Ever wondered how to get a website up and running on the cloud without clicking a hundred buttons? I will show you how to use Terraform, an amazing tool that lets you write code to build your infrastructure on services like AWS.
We'll deploy a simple web server, get a beautiful website template running, and learn some key concepts along the way.
What You Need to Get Started
Before we dive in, make sure you have a few things set up:
Terraform: This is the main tool we'll use. You can download it from the official website
AWS CLI: This lets your computer talk to your Amazon Web Services account. You'll need to install it and set it up with your credentials.
An AWS Account: If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for a free tier account.
Configure an IAM User for Terraform
Before we dive into writing Terraform code, we need to make sure we’re connecting to AWS the right way.
Pro tip: 🚨 Never use your AWS root account for projects! Instead, we’ll create a dedicated IAM user just for Terraform.
Here’s how:
Login to AWS Console and open IAM (Identity & Access Management).
Create a new user – call it something like terraform-user.
Under Access type, check Programmatic access (this gives you an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
Set permissions:
For learning, you can attach AdministratorAccess (full access).
But in the real world, you’d only give the exact permissions needed.
Download credentials: Save the .csv file with your keys , it keep it safe!
Configure AWS CLI so Terraform knows how to connect. Run this in your terminal:
aws configure
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then enter your:
Access Key ID
Secret Access Key
Default region: us-east-1
Output format: json
Step 1: Setting Up Your Project Folder
First things first, let's get organized! Create a new folder for your project on your computer, I made use of vscode( it's easier to set up your projects using it) Inside this folder, you'll create a few files. You can copy the code I've provided below into each file.
Here's a list of the files you'll need:
provider.tf
vars.tf
keypair.tf
secgrp.tf
instance.tf
web.sh
Step 2: Tell Terraform to Use AWS (provider.tf)
This file is like an introduction. It tells Terraform, "Hey, we're going to be working with AWS, and we'll be in the US East (N. Virginia) region."
Just copy this code into a file named provider.tf.
provider "aws" {
region = var.region
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Organize Your Code with Variables (vars.tf)
Instead of typing things like "us-east-1" over and over, we can use variables. This makes your code cleaner and easier to change later. This file defines where your resources will live and which type of server we'll use.
Copy this code into vars.tf.
variable "region" {
default = "us-east-1"
}
variable "zone1" {
default = "us-east-1a"
}
variable "webuser" {
default = "ubuntu"
}
variable "amiID" {
type = map(any)
default = {
us-east-2 = "ami-0cfde0ea8edd312d4"
us-east-1 = "ami-0360c520857e3138f"
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Create a Key to Lock and Unlock Your Server (keypair.tf and dovekey.pub)
To securely log in to your server, you need a special key. This is a standard process called SSH.
Open your terminal and create your own key pair. You can use this command in your terminal:
ssh-keygen
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
It will ask you to enter the file path: give the key name; press enter.
This will create two files: dovekey (your private key) and dovekey.pub (your public key). Keep the private key safe!
Copy the entire content of your new dovekey.pub file into a new file of the same name.
Now, create a file called keypair.tf to tell AWS to recognize your public key.
resource "aws_key_pair" "dove-key" {
key_name
= "dove-key"
public_key = file("dovekey.pub")
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 5: Set Up Your Server's Firewall (secgrp.tf)
Think of a security group as a digital bouncer for your server. It decides who gets in and who doesn't.
Our security group will let people:
SSH (port 22): Only from your computer. Important: You must change the IP address 197.211.58.41/32 to your own IP address. A quick search for "what is my ip" on Google will show you.
HTTP (port 80): From anywhere in the world so everyone can see your website.
All outbound traffic: Your server will be able to connect to the internet to download updates and files.
Copy this code into secgrp.tf
resource "aws_security_group" "dove-sg" {
name
= "dove-sg"
description = "dove-sg"
tags = {
Name = "dove-sg"
}
}
resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "ssh-from-my-ip" {
security_group_id = aws_security_group.dove-sg.id
cidr_ipv4
= "197.211.58.41/32"
from_port
= 22
ip_protocol
= "tcp"
to_port
= 22
}
resource "aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule" "allow_http" {
security_group_id = aws_security_group.dove-sg.id
cidr_ipv4
= "0.0.0.0/0"
from_port
= 80
ip_protocol
= "tcp"
to_port
= 80
}
resource "aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule" "allow_all_outbound_ipv4" {
security_group_id = aws_security_group.dove-sg.id
cidr_ipv4
= "0.0.0.0/0"
ip_protocol
= "-1"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 6: Build the Server! (instance.tf)
This is the main event. This file tells Terraform to create an AWS server (an EC2 instance) and link it to the key pair and security group we just defined.
The special part here is the provisioner blocks. They tell Terraform to:
Upload our web.sh file to the server.
Log in to the server via SSH.
Run the web.sh script to install our website!
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
ami
= var.amiID[var.region]
instance_type
= "t3.micro"
key_name
= "dove-key"
vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.dove-sg.id]
availability_zone
= var.zone1
tags = {
Name
= "Dove-web"
project = "Dove"
}
provisioner "file" {
source
= "web.sh"
destination = "/tmp/web.sh"
}
connection {
type
= "ssh"
user
= var.webuser
private_key = file("dovekey")
host
= self.public_ip
}
provisioner "remote-exec" {
inline = [
"chmod +x /tmp/web.sh",
"sudo /tmp/web.sh"
]
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 7: The "Magic" Script (web.sh)
This simple script is what actually installs a web server (Apache) and puts a website on it. It downloads a free website template( I made use of a template from top plate com), unzips it, and copies all the files to the correct place.
#!/bin/bash
apt update
apt install wget unzip apache2 -y
systemctl start apache2
systemctl enable apache2
wget https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2117_infinite_loop.zip
unzip -o 2117_infinite_loop.zip
cp -r 2117_infinite_loop/* /var/www/html/
systemctl restart apache2
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 9: Get the Details of Your New Server (outputs.tf)
This is where we tell Terraform to show us the most important information after it's done creating everything. This makes it super easy to find your new website.
Create a new file named outputs.tf and add this code:
output "instance_id" {
description = "The ID of the EC2 instance"
value
= aws_instance.web.id
}
output "public_ip" {
description = "The public IP address of the EC2 instance"
value
= aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 10: An Important Note on State Files
When you run Terraform, it creates files like terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup. These files are very important because they keep a record of everything Terraform has created.
Never, ever, commit these files to Git! They can contain sensitive information and can cause huge problems if you work with a team.
To prevent this, create a file in your project folder called .gitignore and add the following lines, or we could create an s3bucket but let's stick with this for now:
Terraform
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
Step 11: Run Your Code!
Now for the fun part! Open your terminal, go to your project folder, and run these commands one by one.
Initialize Terraform:
terraform init- starts up your terraform
terraform fmt- corrects the format of your file
terraform validate - checks if your configuration as syntax error
terraform plan-shows you what changes will be applied.
terraform apply-Apply the Plan (and Watch the Magic Happen!).
When prompted, type yes and hit Enter. Terraform will now build everything for you.
Step 12: Check It Out!
Once the process is complete, you will see the outputs you defined! Just copy the
public_ip value and paste it into your web browser. You should see your new website!
Step 13: Clean Up!
To avoid getting charged by AWS, it's a great habit to clean up your resources when you're done. Just run this simple command:
terraform destroy
This will tear down everything you created. All gone!
And there you have it!. Below is the image of the website provisioned.

Great analysis! Automating deployments using Terraform is transformative. For those aiming to scale, consider integrating AWS App Runner for containerized applications or Elastic Beanstalk for a more managed solution. Has anyone tried combining Terraform with these services?

Thanks for the great insight! I haven't tried App runner or elastic beanstalk with terraform yet but I can see how they will simplify scaling and management compared to running everything on Ec2. Definitely something i would like to experiment with!
