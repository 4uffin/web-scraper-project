Referenceable: Generate Unique Laravel Model References the
#laravel
#php
#opensource
In many web applications, generating unique reference numbers for models is a common requirement.
Whether you're building:
an e-commerce platform that needs order numbers,
an invoicing system requiring invoice references, or
any application that needs trackable identifiers,
managing reference number generation can quickly become complex.
Referenceable is a Laravel package by Mohamed Said that simplifies this challenge.
It enables the generation of customizable model reference numbers with flexible formats and powerful configuration options.
✨ Main Features
Multiple Generation Strategies
Random, sequential, and template-based reference generation.
Highly Configurable
Define prefixes, suffixes, separators, and more.
Template System
Use placeholders like {YEAR}, {MONTH}, {SEQ}, {RANDOM} for complex formats.
Sequential Numbering
Auto-incrementing sequences with reset options (daily, monthly, yearly).
Validation & Verification
Built-in reference validation and uniqueness checking.
Collision Handling
Automatic collision detection and resolution.
Multi-Tenancy Support
Tenant-aware reference generation.
Artisan Commands
Comprehensive CLI tools for management and maintenance.
Performance Optimized
Caching, batch processing, and database transactions.
🚀 Example Usage
1️⃣ Migration
Create a migration with a reference_number column:
Schema::create('status_letters', function (Blueprint $table) {
$table->id();
$table->string('reference_number')->unique()->index();
// other columns...
$table->timestamps();
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2️⃣ Model Configuration
Use the HasReference trait and configure the reference strategy:
use MohamedSaid\Referenceable\Traits\HasReference;
class StatusLetter extends Model
{
use HasReference;
protected $referenceColumn = 'reference_number';
protected $referenceStrategy = 'template';
protected $referenceTemplate = [
'format' => '{PREFIX}-{YEAR}{MONTH}{SEQ}',
'sequence_length' => 4,
];
protected $referencePrefix = 'STL';
// Generates: STL-2025090001, STL-2025090002...
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🔀 Other Strategies
Random Strategy:
protected $referenceStrategy = 'random';
protected $referencePrefix = 'STL';
protected $referenceLength = 6;
protected $referenceCase = 'upper';
// Generates: STL-A12BC3
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Sequential Strategy:
protected $referenceStrategy = 'sequential';
protected $referencePrefix = 'STL';
protected $referenceSequential = [
'start' => 1000,
'min_digits' => 4,
'reset_frequency' => 'monthly', // never, daily, monthly, yearly
];
// Generates: STL-001000, STL-001001, STL-001002...
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
✅ Tip: You can also configure references globally in config/referenceable.php instead of per model.
🛠 Useful Methods & Scopes
// Manually generate without saving
$reference = $statusLetter->generateReference();
// Check if a model has a reference
if ($statusLetter->hasReference()) {
echo "Reference Number: " . $statusLetter->reference;
}
// Find a record by reference number
$statusLetter = StatusLetter::findByReference('STL-2025090001');
// Query references starting with a prefix
$lettersThisMonth = StatusLetter::referenceStartsWith('STL-202509')->get();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
⚡ Installation

composer require eg-mohamed/referenceable

Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
