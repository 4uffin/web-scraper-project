Hello everyone!
Today, I'd like to share a small project I completed in a couple of days, just out of boredom.
In this game you play as an ant who is hungry and wants to eat all the apples 🍏
🎮 Gameplay
I made a small 2D scene where you can move the ant by pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. In the mobile version, I added buttons in the center. The ant can move left and right and jump.
🎯 A small achievement
Surprisingly, the game became the second on YC in the ShowHN tab
👾 Try to play
