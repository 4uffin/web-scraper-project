9 Open Source Gems Every Developer Should Know 🔥
#webdev
#javascript
#programming
#opensource
TL;DR
Today, there are many interesting projects that are not so popular, but which have great potential to make the development process much faster and more efficient.
They may be in different areas of programming, but they all fit together as a single puzzle to create a picture of the industry as a whole.
In this article, I have prepared a list of several interesting tools, knowledge of which will help you become a cool specialist!
Well, let's get started! 🏎️
1. 🐜 HMPL - 23KB template language for displaying UI from server to client
We open our list with a small template language that will help you get ready-made components from the server. This can significantly reduce the size of your web applications.
hmpl is a small template language for displaying UI from server to client. It is based on customizable requests sent to the server via fetch and processed into ready-made HTML
💎 Check out HMPL
2. 💼 Frappe HR - Open Source HR and Payroll Software
The next project is an open source business solution for HR management from Frappe. This company has been around for a long time and has a really big name in the industry, as you may have used (or are using) its ERPNext product if you work as a manager.
Frappe HR has everything you need to drive excellence within the company. It's a complete HRMS solution with over 13 different modules right from Employee Management, Onboarding, Leaves, to Payroll, Taxation, and more!
💎 Check out Frappe HR
3. 🗒 Readme.so - An online drag-and-drop editor to easily build READMEs
Next up is one of my favorite tools that I discovered relatively recently and can recommend - this handy README editor. If you're just starting out, this is a really good place to start.
Readme.so is an online editor to help developers make readmes for their project.
💎 Check out Readme.so
4. 🧠 Agent TARS - The Open-sourced Multimodal AI Agent Stack connecting Cutting-edge AI Models and Agent Infra.
None of my lists are complete without AI projects and this time will be no exception. Especially when it comes to ByteDance and its new product. With this tool, you can implement a convenient UI for AI agents either in a browser or in a terminal.
agent-tars --provider openai --model gpt-4o --apiKey {apiKey}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Agent TARS is a general multimodal AI Agent stack, it brings the power of GUI Agent and Vision into your terminal, computer, browser and product.
💎 Check out Agent TARS
5. 📄 Resume Matcher - Get insights, keyword suggestions and tune your resumes to job descriptions
I have been following this project since 2024 and I was happy to see how it grew. In the last article, when I talked about it, it still had 8 thousand stars, and today it already has more than 20. This is a good project that will allow you to create a quality resume and with a high probability get an invitation to an interview, if you are a job seeker, and find interesting candidates, returning to the topic, if you are HR. Also, this project is supported by Vercel, which is cool.
Resume Matcher is the AI-powered platform that reverse-engineers hiring algorithms to show you exactly how to tailor your resume.
💎 Check out Resume Matcher
6. ⚙️ MLX - An array framework for Apple silicon
An excellent framework from Apple that will allow you to teach your MacBook, iMac and other devices to solve many necessary tasks for business and more.
MLX is designed by machine learning researchers for machine learning researchers. The framework is intended to be user-friendly, but still efficient to train and deploy models. The design of the framework itself is also conceptually simple.
💎 Check out MLX
7. 🌐 GitMCP -
free, open-source, remote MCP server for any GitHub project
The next project is the most trendy one, which is everywhere today - MCP server. Until recently, it seemed something incomprehensible, but now MCP server (not this project, but simply), let's say, is introduced into VS Code in an update, many new projects are coming out and this is one of the first.
GitMCP is a free, open-source, remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that transforms any GitHub project (repositories or GitHub pages) into a documentation hub. It enables AI tools like Cursor to access up-to-date documentation and code, even if the LLM has never encountered them, thereby eliminating code hallucinations seamlessly.
💎 Check out GitMCP
8. 👀 Mockoon - Easiest and quickest way to run mock APIs locally
Now, let's move on to creating an API. If you want to test your application route on a localhost, say, how information about products comes in, then you can do it thanks to this tool without deploying to dev or prod.
Mockoon is the easiest and quickest way to design and run mock APIs. No remote deployment, no account required, free and open-source.
💎 Check out Mockoon repository
9. 💨 Vue-Vapor - Vue Vapor is a variant of Vue that offers rendering without the Virtual DOM
And last on the list, but not least in importance, is the already archived, but nevertheless, already official mod for the Vue framework, which after 3 long years has finally been released! This is a real success, since now we can confidently say that billions of site users will now be able to view content faster!
This repository is a fork of vuejs/core and is used for research and development of no virtual dom mode.
💎 Check out Vue-Vapor (Vue mode)
✅ Conclusion
In this list, I tried to collect projects with completely different topics from AI to HR management. All these topics are relevant today and will be relevant for a long time. Therefore, having understood the trends in these areas, no matter who you work as, you can become a truly cool and promising specialist!
Thank you very much for reading this article ❤️!
What new project have you discovered for yourself, and which one have you been using for a long time? It will be interesting to find out in the comments!
P.S. Also, don't forget to help me and star HMPL!

There have been a lot of cool projects that have come out during this time that I couldn't pass by. I didn't want to make lists anymore, but I just couldn't pass by the projects that I follow. So, I hope you like this list!

Love this list!! shows how much open source drives real progress across every layer of dev work. One that often flies under the radar is Oasis Sapphire: an open-source confidential EVM runtime. It gives Solidity devs the same familiar tools, but adds built-in privacy and confidential compute. For anyone exploring security, data protection, or even AI x blockchain, it’s a gem worth checking out!!
