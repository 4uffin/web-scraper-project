How to Add a Wishlist Heart Icon Inside the Product Image on Prestige Theme?
#shopify
#webdev
#frontend
#tutorial
üëâ Before you continue: This guide assumes you‚Äôre already familiar with the Wishlist Power web component. If you haven‚Äôt yet, I recommend starting with this article: Wishlist Button Web Component for Shopify.
If you‚Äôre using the Prestige theme, you can easily place a heart icon directly inside the product image on the product page by leveraging the <ooo-wl-wishlist-button> web component.
In this article, I‚Äôll show you how to add the icon by editing your theme code.
üéØ Final Result
Here‚Äôs what it will look like once implemented:
The heart icon appears in the top-right corner of the product image, toggling between ‚Äúadd‚Äù and ‚Äúremove‚Äù states.
üìù Step 1 ‚Äî Open snippets/product-gallery.liquid
From your Shopify admin, go to Online Store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Edit code.
In the code editor, open the file snippets/product-gallery.liquid
üîß Step 2 ‚Äî Insert the Wishlist Button
Inside the
element, paste the following code right on top of the div that has the product-gallery__image-list class:
...
<product-gallery class="product-gallery" form="{{ product_form_id }}" {% if enable_media_autoplay %}autoplay-media{%
endif %} {% if enable_image_zoom %}allow-zoom="{{ max_image_zoom_level }}" {% endif %}>
{%- if enable_image_zoom -%}
<button class="product-gallery__zoom-button circle-button circle-button--sm md:hidden" is="open-lightbox-button">
<span class="sr-only">{{ 'product.gallery.zoom' | t }}</span>
{%- render 'icon' with 'zoom' -%}
</button>
{%- endif -%}
<!-- INSERT CODE HERE -->
<ooo-wl-wishlist-button product-id="{{ product.id }}" handle="{{ product.handle }}" loading>
<button type="button">
{%- render 'icon' with 'heart', class: 'header__nav-icon' -%}
</button>
<p>You already have variants in your wishlist.</p>
</ooo-wl-wishlist-button>
<style>
ooo-wl-wishlist-button {
z-index: 1;
position: absolute;
top: 10px;
right: 20px;
button {
display: grid;
width: 50px;
height: 50px;
align-items: center;
justify-content: center;
}
}
/* Show only the Add or Remove button based on state */
button[aria-checked="true"] svg {
fill: black;
}
button[aria-checked="false"] svg {
fill: none;
}
/* Hide the variant message by default */
ooo-wl-wishlist-button p {
display: none;
}
/* Show the message if a variant warning is required */
[show-variant-warning="true"] p {
display: block;
}
/* Loading state */
ooo-wl-wishlist-button[loading] {
display: grid;
border-radius: 2px;
background: #ebebeb;
cursor: not-allowed;
animation: loadingPlaceholder 4s ease infinite;
animation-delay: -.170s;
svg {
display: none;
}
}
@keyframes loadingPlaceholder {
50% {
opacity: 1
}
75% {
opacity: .5
}
to {
opacity: 1
}
}
/* Animation when product is added to wishlist */
ooo-wl-wishlist-button button[aria-busy="true"][aria-checked="true"] svg {
animation: pulse 0.3s cubic-bezier(.13, -0.3, .2, 1.91);
}
@keyframes pulse {
0% {
transform: scale(0.9);
}
50% {
transform: scale(1.2);
}
100% {
transform: scale(1);
}
}
</style>
<!-- INSERT CODE HERE -->
<div class="product-gallery__image-list">
....
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Note: You can adjust the top and right CSS values to position the icon exactly where you want.
‚ù§Ô∏è Step 3 - Add the heart icon in the icon files
In the code editor, open the file snippets/icon.liquid
Add this code below the {%- case icon -%} tag:
...
{%- case icon -%}
{%- comment -%} UI {%- endcomment -%}
{%- when 'heart' -%}
<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" fill="none" width="{{ width | default: 24 }}" class="{{ class | strip }}" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
<path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M11.8482 21.0168C9.19102 19.8759 5.28668 16.1772 3.59901 13.4543C1.5836 10.2027 1.66699 7.42205 2.78053 5.5474C4.68111 2.34888 9.35958 1.94464 12.0001 5.58663C14.6406 1.94489 19.319 2.34863 21.2194 5.54765C22.3332 7.42231 22.4163 10.2029 20.4009 13.4546C18.6346 16.304 14.779 19.8891 12.0001 21.0818L11.8482 21.0168Z" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="{{ stroke_width | default: settings.icon_stroke_width }}" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-linecap="round"/>
</svg>
...
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This will ensure the heart icon is available in your icon list.
üëÄ Step 4 ‚Äî Save and Preview
Once you save the file and reload your product page, you should see the heart icon overlaid on the product image.
Clicking the heart will add or remove the product from the wishlist.
When active, the icon is filled; when inactive, it‚Äôs outlined.
üöÄ Wrapping Up
That‚Äôs it! üéâ You‚Äôve successfully added a wishlist heart icon inside the product image on the Prestige theme.
This integration provides a sleek, customizable button that seamlessly integrates into your product gallery. If you‚Äôd like to explore more advanced customization with the Wishlist web component, check out the full documentation here:
