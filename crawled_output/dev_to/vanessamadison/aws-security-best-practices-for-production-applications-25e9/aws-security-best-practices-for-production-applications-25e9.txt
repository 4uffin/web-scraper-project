AWS Security Best Practices for Production Applications
#aws
#cloud
#security
#devops
AWS can scale your business overnight — or expose it if misconfigured. From IAM sprawl to open S3 buckets, mistakes are common. Security in AWS requires defense in depth.
1. IAM as the First Line
Favor least privilege roles
Avoid all-powerful AdministratorAccess policies
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"s3:GetObject",
"s3:PutObject"
],
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/user-uploads/*",
"Condition": {
"StringEquals": {
"s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
}
}
}
]
}

2. VPC for Layered Defense
Public subnets for entry points
Private subnets for app and database tiers
Restrictive security groups between layers
AppSecurityGroup:
Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
Properties:
GroupDescription: Application tier security group
VpcId: !Ref VPC
SecurityGroupIngress:
- IpProtocol: tcp
FromPort: 443
ToPort: 443
SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref LoadBalancerSecurityGroup
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Encrypt at Rest and in Transit
KMS for S3 and RDS
SSL enforcement on databases
TLS for all APIs
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();
const params = {
Bucket: 'secure-bucket',
Key: 'data.json',
Body: JSON.stringify({ secure: true }),
ServerSideEncryption: 'aws:kms',
SSEKMSKeyId: process.env.KMS_KEY_ID
};
await s3.upload(params).promise();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Monitor and Detect
CloudTrail for audit logs
CloudWatch alarms for anomalies
GuardDuty for threat detection
CloudTrail:
Type: AWS::CloudTrail::Trail
Properties:
TrailName: my-audit-trail
S3BucketName: !Ref AuditLogsBucket
IsMultiRegionTrail: true
EnableLogFileValidation: true
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Manage Secrets Properly
Leverage Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store with automated rotation.
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const sm = new AWS.SecretsManager();
const secret = await sm.getSecretValue({ SecretId: 'prod/db-password' }).promise();
console.log(secret.SecretString);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
6. Automate Compliance
Use Lambda or Config Rules to detect — and remediate — insecure configurations in real time.
import boto3
def lambda_handler(event, context):
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
sgs = ec2.describe_security_groups()['SecurityGroups']
for sg in sgs:
for rule in sg.get('IpPermissions', []):
for ip_range in rule.get('IpRanges', []):
if ip_range.get('CidrIp') == '0.0.0.0/0':
print(f"Insecure SG found: {sg['GroupId']}")
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The cloud is only as secure as the guardrails you define.
With the right practices, AWS becomes not just scalable, but dependable.
I design AWS environments where security is baked in, not bolted on.
