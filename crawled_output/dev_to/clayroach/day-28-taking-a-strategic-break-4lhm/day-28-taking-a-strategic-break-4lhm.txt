Day 28: September 9, 2025
After dropping my nephew off at the airport, I had some time in the afternoon and decided to tackle a performance issue that had been bothering me. What followed was one of those breakthrough sessions where everything clicks.
The Performance Breakthrough (PR #49)
The critical performance improvements actually landed a few days earlier (September 5) in PR #49: LLM Prompting Optimization & Multi-Model Performance Analysis, but today I'm seeing the full impact across the entire system.
Major Achievement: 10x Performance Improvement
LLM Response Time: Reduced from 25+ seconds to 2-3 seconds per call
Multi-model Tests: Improved from 69+ seconds to 4-5 seconds total (15x faster!)
Integration Test Suite: Fixed 6 failing tests - now 169/169 passing reliably
Bottleneck Query Output: Reduced from 9,979 chars of gibberish to 400-460 chars of proper SQL
What PR #49 Actually Fixed
The root cause was fascinating - CodeLlama was treating our example-based prompts as templates to repeat rather than patterns to learn from, generating nearly 10,000 characters of repeated SQL blocks instead of a single optimized query.
Dynamic UI Generation Progress
Building on the performance improvements:
Implemented complete Dynamic UI Generation Pipeline
Fixed TypeScript null check issues in visualization tests
Created Phase 3-4 test infrastructure for dynamic UI generation
Merged PR #47: "Dynamic UI Generation Phase 2 with LLM Manager Service Layer"
Current Project Status
After 28 days of development, here's what's complete:
Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
Storage: ClickHouse with S3 backend, handling OTLP ingestion
LLM Manager: Multi-model orchestration (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
AI Analyzer: Autoencoder-based anomaly detection
Config Manager: Self-healing configuration system
Integration Layer (✅ Working)
// Full telemetry pipeline operational
OTel Demo → Collector → ClickHouse → AI Analysis → UI Generation
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Dynamic UI System (✅ 95% Complete)
Phase 1-2: Component generation working
Phase 3-4: Complete with 10x performance improvements
Final polish: Minor integration work remaining
Why This Performance Issue Matters
The Problem Was Critical
The 25+ second response times were making the entire UI generation pipeline unusable. Every developer iteration was painful, and CI/CD runs were timing out.
The Fix Was Non-Obvious
This wasn't a simple optimization. It required understanding how different LLM models interpret prompts and discovering that CodeLlama was treating examples as templates to repeat rather than patterns to learn from.
Efficiency Metrics
The numbers tell an interesting story about development efficiency:
Traditional Enterprise Timeline:
Team size: 6-10 developers
Duration: 9-15 months
Total hours: 2000-4000
This Project:
Team size: 1 developer + AI assistance
Duration: 30 days
Development approach: AI-native with Claude Code
That's a 20-40x efficiency improvement, achieved through:
AI-powered development with Claude Code
Documentation-driven design
Effect-TS architecture for type safety
Focused development sessions
Day 28 Technical Deep Dive
The 10x Performance Fix (From PR #49)
The biggest win was identifying why LLM queries were taking 25+ seconds. The issue? Example-based prompts were causing CodeLlama to generate 9,979 characters of repeated SQL blocks.
The Solution: Template-Based Prompting
// Before: Example-based prompting (slow, unpredictable)
const prompt = `Here are 5 examples of bottleneck queries...
Example 1: SELECT... (500+ chars)
Example 2: SELECT... (500+ chars)
...`
// Result: 9,979 characters of repeated nonsense
// After: Goal-specific templates (fast, deterministic)
const bottleneckSQL = `
Generate ClickHouse SQL for bottleneck analysis:
- Required: total_time_impact_ms calculation
- Table: traces
- Service filter: ${escapeServiceName(serviceName)}
- Time range: last ${timeRange}
- Max results: 10
`
// Result: 400-460 chars of proper SQL
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Security Enhancement: SQL Injection Protection
PR #49 also added critical security improvements:
// New escapeServiceName() function prevents injection attacks
function escapeServiceName(name: string): string {
return `'${name.replace(/'/g, "''")}'`
}
// Protects against attacks like: frontend' OR '1'='1
// Becomes: 'frontend'' OR ''1''=''1' (safely escaped)

Effect-TS Parallelization Improvements
PR #49 also converted Promise.all to Effect.all for better parallelization:
// Before: Sequential Promise execution
const results = await Promise.all(models.map(m => m.generate(prompt)))
// After: Unbounded concurrent Effect execution
const results = yield* Effect.all(
models.map(m => m.generate(prompt)),
{ concurrency: 'unbounded' }
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This change alone improved multi-model test performance from 69+ seconds to 4-5 seconds - a 15x improvement!
Result: Clean, efficient queries that execute in 2-3 seconds instead of 25+, with the entire test suite running 15x faster.
Technical Achievements Overall
Real Data Processing
The platform successfully processes telemetry from the OpenTelemetry Demo:
# Verified data flow
docker exec otel-ai-clickhouse clickhouse-client \
--query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM otel.traces WHERE service_name='cartservice'"
# Result: 15,847 traces processed

Exit fullscreen mode
AI Analysis Working
// Anomaly detection on real telemetry
const anomalies = await analyzer.detectAnomalies({
service: 'frontend',
threshold: 0.95,
windowSize: 100
})
// Successfully identifying outlier patterns
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Dynamic UI Generation
// LLM-generated React components
const dashboard = await uiGenerator.create({
data: anomalies,
chartType: 'timeseries',
framework: 'echarts'
})
// Producing valid, renderable components
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Final Two Days Plan
Day 29 (Today) - Integration Focus
Complete dynamic UI phase 3-4 implementation
End-to-end pipeline validation
Performance optimization
Integration testing
Day 30 (Tomorrow) - Launch Preparation
Final testing and benchmarks
Documentation updates
Performance metrics collection
Series wrap-up
Key Learnings
Building this platform in 30 days has validated several hypotheses:
AI as Development Accelerator
Claude Code isn't just autocomplete—it's a true pair programmer that can:
Generate entire packages from specifications
Refactor complex code patterns
Debug integration issues
Maintain consistent architecture
Documentation-Driven Development Works
Starting with Dendron specifications before code:
Reduces rework and refactoring
Improves AI code generation quality
Creates living documentation
Enables better architectural decisions
Type Safety Scales
Effect-TS patterns provide:
Compile-time error prevention
Better AI understanding of code intent
Easier refactoring and maintenance
Cleaner integration boundaries
Focused Sessions Beat Long Hours
Short, focused sessions create:
Higher quality code output
Better architectural decisions
Sustainable development pace
Time for other priorities
The Home Stretch
With two days remaining, the project is in excellent shape:
Infrastructure: 100% complete
AI Systems: 100% complete with 10x performance boost
Dynamic UI: 95% complete
Integration: Fully operational
The afternoon's work resolved the last major technical blocker.
Technical Preview
Here's what the final system architecture looks like:
Data Flow Pipeline:
[OTel Demo Services]
↓ OTLP
[OpenTelemetry Collector]
↓ Protobuf
[ClickHouse Database]
↓ SQL
[Storage Layer]
↓ Traces
[AI Analyzer] ←→ [Autoencoder Models]
↓ Anomalies
[LLM Manager] ←→ [GPT-4, Claude, Llama]
↓ Prompts
[UI Generator]
↓ React Components
[Dynamic Dashboard]

Exit fullscreen mode
Each component is modular, testable, and ready for production deployment.
Next Steps
Day 29 will focus on:
Final UI polish and integration
Performance validation under load
End-to-end testing with real telemetry
Documentation updates
The 30-day goal remains well within reach.
