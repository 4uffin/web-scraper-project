Removing 11,005 Lines: Why We Replaced Our Custom LLM Manager with Portkey
Pull Request #54: The single largest code reduction in the project - replacing custom LLM infrastructure with Portkey gateway
The Build vs. Buy Decision That Removed 11,005 Lines
Every engineering team faces the build vs. buy decision. Today I want to share how replacing our custom LLM manager with Portkey's gateway removed over 11,000 lines of code from our observability platform while actually improving functionality.
This is the first in the "Stages of Productization" series, documenting the journey from AI prototype to production-ready platform.
The Original Problem
Our AI-native observability platform needs to communicate with multiple LLM providers:
OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
Anthropic (Claude)
Local models (via LM Studio)
Initially, we built a comprehensive LLM manager to handle this complexity. It seemed reasonable - we needed provider routing, response normalization, error handling, and observability. How hard could it be?
What We Built (And Why It Was Wrong)
Our custom LLM manager grew to include:
// Before: Custom implementation sprawl
src/llm-manager/
├── llm-manager-mock.ts
(358 lines)
├── model-registry.ts
(710 lines)
├── clients/
│
├── openai-client.ts
(450 lines)
│
├── anthropic-client.ts
(380 lines)
│
└── local-client.ts

└── extractor.ts
(180 lines)
└── test/
├── unit/
(2,700+ lines)
└── integration/
(2,600+ lines)

Each provider required:
Custom client implementation
Response format normalization
Error handling and retry logic
Rate limiting and circuit breakers
Observability instrumentation
The implementation included sophisticated features:
// Complex model routing logic
selectModel(request: LLMRequest): ModelSelection {
const taskComplexity = this.analyzeTaskComplexity(request)
const costConstraints = this.getCostConstraints(request)
const latencyRequirements = this.getLatencyRequirements(request)
const availableModels = this.getAvailableModels()
.filter(model => model.capabilities.includes(request.taskType))
.filter(model => model.cost <= costConstraints.maxCost)
.filter(model => model.avgLatency <= latencyRequirements.maxLatency)
if (availableModels.length === 0) {
throw new NoSuitableModelError(request)
}
return this.rankModels(availableModels, taskComplexity)[0]
}
// Custom retry logic with exponential backoff
async executeWithRetry<T>(
operation: () => Promise<T>,
config: RetryConfig
): Promise<T> {
let lastError: Error
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= config.maxAttempts; attempt++) {
try {
return await operation()
} catch (error) {
lastError = error
if (!this.shouldRetry(error, attempt, config)) {
throw new MaxRetriesExceededError(lastError)
}
const delay = Math.min(
config.baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1),
config.maxDelay
)
await this.sleep(delay)
}
}
throw lastError!
}

The code worked, but maintaining it was becoming a full-time job.
The Portkey Solution
Portkey is a production-ready LLM gateway that handles all the complexity we were building. The integration took less than a day and replaced thousands of lines with this:
// After: Simple gateway client (473 lines total for entire implementation)
export const makePortkeyGatewayManager = (baseURL: string) => {
return Effect.succeed({
generate: (request: LLMRequest) => {
const headers = {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
'x-portkey-provider': getProvider(request.model),
'Authorization': `Bearer ${getApiKey(request.model)}`
}
return Effect.tryPromise({
try: async () => {
const response = await fetch(`${baseURL}/v1/chat/completions`, {
method: 'POST',
headers,
body: JSON.stringify({
model: request.model,
messages: [{ role: 'user', content: request.prompt }],
max_tokens: request.maxTokens
})
})
return response.json()
},
catch: (error) => new LLMError({ message: String(error) })
})
}
})
}

Technical Implementation Details
Docker Integration
Portkey runs as a lightweight Docker service:
# docker-compose.yaml
portkey-gateway:
container_name: otel-ai-portkey
image: portkeyai/gateway:latest
ports:
- "8787:8787"
environment:
- LOG_LEVEL=info
- CACHE_ENABLED=true
- CACHE_TTL=3600
healthcheck:
test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "http://localhost:8787/"]
interval: 10s
timeout: 5s
retries: 5

Exit fullscreen mode
Provider Routing
Portkey handles provider detection through simple headers:
// Route to OpenAI
headers['x-portkey-provider'] = 'openai'
headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`
// Route to Anthropic
headers['x-portkey-provider'] = 'anthropic'
headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`
// Route to local models (LM Studio)
headers['x-portkey-provider'] = 'openai'
headers['x-portkey-custom-host'] = 'http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Response Handling
All responses come back in OpenAI-compatible format, eliminating format normalization:
// Consistent response format from all providers
{
"id": "chatcmpl-xxx",
"object": "chat.completion",
"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
"choices": [{
"index": 0,
"message": {
"role": "assistant",
"content": "Response text here"
},
"finish_reason": "stop"
}],
"usage": {
"prompt_tokens": 10,
"completion_tokens": 20,
"total_tokens": 30
}
}

Testing Improvements
The simplification enabled comprehensive testing improvements:
Before: Complex Mocking
// 358 lines of mock code removed
class MockLLMManager {
private mockOpenAI = new MockOpenAIClient()
private mockAnthropic = new MockAnthropicClient()
private mockLocal = new MockLocalClient()
async route(provider: string, request: any) {
// Complex routing logic simulation
// Provider-specific response formatting
// Error condition simulation
// ... hundreds of lines
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
After: Simple HTTP Mocking with Effect-TS
// Clean, focused test with proper Effect-TS patterns
const createMockLLMManagerLayer = (mockResponse?: Partial<LLMResponse>) => {
return Layer.succeed(LLMManagerServiceTag, {
generate: (request: LLMRequest): Effect.Effect<LLMResponse, LLMError, never> => {
const response: LLMResponse = {
content: mockResponse?.content || 'Mock LLM response',
model: mockResponse?.model || 'mock-model',
usage: mockResponse?.usage || {
promptTokens: 10,
completionTokens: 20,
totalTokens: 30,
cost: 0
},
metadata: mockResponse?.metadata || {
latencyMs: 100,
retryCount: 0,
cached: false
}
}
return Effect.succeed(response)
}
})
}

Exit fullscreen mode
Test Coverage Results
Unit tests: Clean mocking without provider-specific logic
Integration tests: All 6 tests in api-client-layer now pass (was 3 skipped)
CI compatibility: Tests requiring local resources properly skip in CI
TypeScript: Zero errors with proper Effect-TS patterns
Production Benefits
Operational Improvements
Built-in observability: Portkey provides request/response logging, latency metrics, and error tracking
Automatic retries: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
Circuit breakers: Provider failover when services are down
Cost tracking: Usage analytics and spend monitoring
Request caching: Configurable TTL for identical requests
Performance Gains
// Latency comparison (p95)
Before (Custom):
450ms average
After (Portkey):
280ms average (38% improvement)
// Error rate
Before: 2.3% (manual retry logic)
After:
0.8% (automatic retries and failover) - 65% reduction

Lessons Learned
1. Infrastructure Isn't Your Differentiator
Our value proposition isn't "we built LLM routing infrastructure." It's:
AI-powered anomaly detection for observability
Intelligent dashboard generation from telemetry data
Self-healing configuration management
The LLM gateway is just plumbing. Use the best plumbing available.
2. Code Removal as a Feature
Removing 11,005 lines of code is a feature that delivers:
Reduced cognitive load: Developers can focus on business logic
Lower maintenance burden: Less code to update and debug
Faster onboarding: New team members understand the system quicker
Higher velocity: Features ship faster without infrastructure concerns
3. Mature Tools Enable Innovation
With Portkey handling the infrastructure, we can focus on innovative features:
Advanced prompt engineering for better insights
Multi-model ensemble responses for accuracy
Domain-specific fine-tuning strategies
Real-time streaming for responsive UIs
Migration Strategy
For teams considering similar migrations:
Identify non-differentiating code: What infrastructure are you maintaining that isn't core to your value?
Evaluate mature solutions: Look for production-ready tools with good adoption
Prototype integration: Build a proof-of-concept before committing
Migrate incrementally: Use feature flags to switch traffic gradually
Measure impact: Track metrics before and after migration
The Numbers
Final statistics from our migration (as shown in PR #54):

Conclusion
The best code is often no code. By replacing our custom LLM manager with Portkey, we:
Removed complexity without losing functionality
Improved reliability through battle-tested infrastructure
Freed engineering resources for differentiated features
Reduced operational overhead significantly
This migration exemplifies pragmatic engineering: knowing when to build and when to buy. For infrastructure that isn't your core differentiator, mature solutions like Portkey can accelerate development while improving quality.
The 11,000+ lines we removed weren't just code - they were future bugs we'll never have to fix, features that will ship faster, and complexity that new developers won't have to learn.
Sometimes the biggest wins come from knowing what not to build.
