SOC-CERT: Enterprise Cybersecurity Dashboard with Real AI & 15+ KendoReact Components
#devchallenge
#kendoreactchallenge
#react
#webdev
This is a submission for the KendoReact Free Components Challenge.
‚ö° TL;DR
15+ KendoReact Free components, theme‚Äëonly styling, strong UX/A11y, and a clear SOC analyst flow (Grid with sorting/filtering/paging, Charts, TabStrip/Drawer/Menu, Buttons, Tooltip, Loader, AutoComplete).
KendoReact AI Coding Assistant used end‚Äëto‚Äëend for Grid/Charts configuration, responsive layout, and theme consistency; about 40% faster development and 15 components mastered in 16 days.
Real AI integration that never blocks the demo: Cohere v2/chat (model: command‚Äëa‚Äë03‚Äë2025) with messages[] and parsing from message.content[].text, plus an intelligent fallback; visible badges display environment (Prod/Dev) and source (cohere‚Äëdirect/demo/intelligent‚Äëfallback).
Live demo and repository included; screenshots show the Kendo Assistant interactions and the AI analysis header with badges for judge clarity.
What I Built
SOC-CERT: Enterprise Cybersecurity Dashboard with Real AI & 15+ KendoReact Components
SOC-CERT Dashboard delivers enterprise security monitoring with real Cohere API integration (when available) and intelligent analysis fallback - ensuring 100% uptime for critical operations. This frontend layer extends my award-winning "SOC-CERT ‚Äì Automated Threat Intelligence System" to provide security analysts with real-time threat visualization.
üîç Problem it solves: Security teams lack accessible, real-time tools for monitoring evolving threats. SOC-CERT transforms raw data into clear triage workflows, giving SOC analysts enterprise SIEM visibility‚Äîfaster to deploy and easier to use.
Key Features:
Real-time alert monitoring with filtering/sorting/pagination
AI-powered threat analysis using Cohere Command model
Professional dark/light SOC-themed interface
100% KendoReact components + theme only
Mobile-responsive design
Environment badges showing AI source (Cohere-Direct/Intelligent-Fallback)

AI Analysis in Action
Real Cohere API response with risk scoring and recommendations
Judging Criteria Mapping:
Use of underlying technology: KendoReact Free (15+), Assistant usage, Cohere v2/chat messages[] parsing.
Usability and User Experience: responsive Grid/Charts, clear SOC flow, environment/source badges.
Accessibility: keyboard navigation, WCAG color contrast, themed components.
Creativity: SOC/CERT dashboard with real AI and resilient fallback.

ü§ñ Real AI Integration (No Mocking)
Authentic Cohere API Implementation:
Production API Calls: cohere.ai/v2/chat with messages[]
Live Threat Analysis: Model command-a-03-2025, parsed from message.content[].text
Transparent Operation: Environment badges show source (Cohere-Direct/Fallback)
Graceful Degradation: Intelligent analysis when API limited
Evidence in Demo:
Badge: Prod + Cohere-Direct when API available
Badge: Intelligent-Fallback when API limited
Real-time model identification: command-a-03-2025
[Optional: Code Smarter, Not Harder prize category] AI Coding Assistant Usage
Concrete KendoReact AI Assistant Integration with Evidence:
Used systematically to accelerate from beginner to 15-component mastery in 16 days.
üì∏ Visual Evidence of AI Assistant Guidance
