üöÄ Scaffolder-Toolkit (dk): Your Universal CLI for Professional Development

Tired of juggling boilerplate, inconsistent setups, and manual project configurations? Meet the Scaffolder-Toolkit (dk), a powerful command-line interface engineered to streamline your development workflow. Built for the Node.js ecosystem, dk provides an intelligent, workspace-aware solution to standardize project creation and maintenance.
Whether you're bootstrapping a new project, adding a package to a monorepo, or enforcing team-wide conventions, dk is the essential tool for a superior developer experience (DX).
The Core: Features Engineered for Developers üõ†Ô∏è
Unified Command: Access all features with the short, intuitive command dk.
Intelligent Scaffolding: Skip the repetitive boilerplate. dk new scaffolds projects from pre-configured, production-ready templates. It‚Äôs not just about starting fast; it‚Äôs about starting right, every time.
Example: Bootstrapping a New Project
# Create a new Vue project
dk new javascript my-awesome-app -t vue
Monorepo-Native: dk isn't just monorepo-compatible‚Äîit's workspace-aware. The CLI intelligently applies configuration and settings from your monorepo's root, ensuring a seamless, consistent experience across all packages and contributors.
Robust Configuration: The tool reliably finds your configuration file (.devkit.json) and uses a clear priority system to manage both local and global settings. This eliminates configuration drift and ensures consistency.
Powerful Cache Management: Optimize project setup speed with flexible caching strategies for your templates, especially when using GitHub URLs. You can choose to always-refresh, never-refresh, or use the default daily refresh.
Extensible and Dynamic: Go beyond the built-in templates. dk allows you to integrate custom templates from any Git repository or local folder. This means you can create your own company-specific templates and share them effortlessly.
Example: Adding a Custom Template from GitHub
dk add-template javascript react-ts-template https://github.com/my-user/my-react-ts-template.git --description "My custom React TS template"
Built for Humans: The dk CLI is designed with simplicity in mind. It supports full internationalization (i18n), automatically adapting to your system's language for a truly global, intuitive experience.
Why dk is a Game-Changer üéØ
In a world of fragmented tooling, dk provides a unified front for project bootstrapping. It's a workflow accelerator that reduces context-switching, minimizes human error, and empowers teams to focus on shipping code, not configuring it.
