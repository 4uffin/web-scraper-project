Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
Content is king, but eye-catching visuals are the gatekeepers. For creators and e-commerce sellers, producing stunning thumbnails and professional product photos is a constant, time-consuming challenge. I built Super Banana, an AI-powered web app that acts as a creative co-pilot, drastically simplifying the creation of high-quality visuals.
Super Banana is a suite of three powerful tools:
Thumbnail Builder: Users upload their assets (like a selfie or a product image), describe their video's topic, and the AI composes a complete, click-worthy thumbnail, even generating custom backgrounds on the fly. (even this blog's cover also generated by super banana üòÉ)
Product Photoshoot: This tool transforms a simple product image into a professional, catalog-ready shot. Just upload a photo, describe a scene (e.g., "on a marble countertop with morning light"), and the AI creates a photorealistic image with perfect lighting and shadows.
Reimaginer: A creative playground for generating new images from text or transforming existing photos with a simple prompt, like turning a photo into a watercolor painting or a die-cut sticker.
Demo
Here's the Demo of Super Banana:
Google Cloud Deployed Version: Super Banana
How I Used Google AI Studio
Super Banana is powered by Google's state-of-the-art Gemini models, accessed via the @google/genai SDK. I strategically chose different models for different tasks to achieve the best results:
For pure text-to-image generation, like creating a background scene from scratch in the Thumbnail Builder, I used imagen-4.0-generate-001. It excels at interpreting descriptive prompts and producing high-resolution, artistic images.
For the heavy lifting and multimodal magic, I relied on gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview. This powerful model can understand and process a combination of text and multiple image inputs simultaneously. This was the key to unlocking the app's core features, allowing me to send image assets, style examples, and a text prompt all in a single API call to compose a final, cohesive visual.
My development process involved extensive prompt engineering, crafting detailed system instructions that guide the AI to act as a "world-class graphic designer" or a "professional product photographer," ensuring the output is not just technically correct but also aesthetically pleasing and commercially viable.
Multimodal Features
The true power of Super Banana lies in its deep integration of multimodal AI, which creates an experience far beyond simple image generation.
AI-Assisted Composition: The Thumbnail Builder doesn't just place images on a background; it uses gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview to understand the context of multiple assets and a text prompt. The model intelligently removes backgrounds, determines an effective layout, and blends all elements into a polished final thumbnail. This automates complex design work that would typically require manual effort in tools like Photoshop.
Contextual Image Editing: Both the Product Photoshoot and Reimaginer features leverage the model's ability to interpret an existing image and a text command. It doesn't just overlay effects; it comprehends the prompt ("add a steaming cup of coffee next to the laptop") and realistically edits the image, matching perspective, lighting, and reflections for a seamless result.
Few-Shot Style Transfer: This is my favorite feature. In the settings, users can upload "style examples"‚Äîimages with an aesthetic they love. When generating a new image, these examples are sent to the model along with the prompt and assets. The AI then emulates the mood, color grading, and composition of the examples. This gives users incredible artistic control, allowing them to maintain consistent branding and generate visuals in their unique style, making the AI a true creative partner.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Super Banana successfully lowers the barrier to entry for creating high-quality visual content, making it an indispensable asset for marketers, content creators, and anyone with a story to tell visually. Super Banana isn't just about making pictures; it's about making an impact, and it delivers on that promise with remarkable fineness. Google AI Studio also plays a crucial role in bringing this idea to life. (Truly amazing...)
