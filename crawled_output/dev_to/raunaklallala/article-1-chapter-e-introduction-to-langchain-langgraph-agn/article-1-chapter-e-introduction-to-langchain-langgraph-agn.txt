LangChain & LangGraph: What You Need to Know Before You Build Agents and GenAI Applications
1. Why LangChain?
LangChain is one of the most widely adopted frameworks for building LLM-powered applications. While LLMs on their own can generate text, LangChain connects them to:
Tools (like APIs, calculators, databases).
Memory (short-term & long-term).
Chains & Agents (structured multi-step reasoning).
Think of it as the glue layer between an LLM and the real world.
Official Docs: LangChain Documentation
2. What About LangGraph?
LangGraph is an extension built by the same team, focused on agent workflows.
Where LangChain gives you chains and tool usage, LangGraph adds state machines and graphs ‚Äî ideal for orchestrating multi-step or multi-agent systems.
-> In short:
LangChain ‚Üí Great for prototyping and connecting models.
LangGraph ‚Üí Great for scaling to real-world, reliable agent systems.
Official Docs: LangGraph Documentation
3. Why This Tutorial Uses LangChain And LangGraph
In this series, our focus is Agentic AI. LangChain & LangGraph give us:
Rapid prototyping (easy chains, tools, prompts).
Production patterns (memory, state management, graphs).
Community support (huge ecosystem, tutorials, integrations).
They‚Äôre not the only option, but they balance beginner-friendliness and professional depth.
4. Alternatives You Should Know
Depending on your use case, you might explore:
LlamaIndex (GPT Index) ‚Üí Strong for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) use cases.
Haystack ‚Üí Powerful for search + retrieval pipelines.
Guidance ‚Üí Focused on controlling LLM output formats.
AutoGPT / BabyAGI ‚Üí More experimental ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù frameworks.
Each has trade-offs, but LangChain remains the most versatile entry point.
5. Limitations of LangChain / LangGraph
Complexity ‚Üí Large learning curve for beginners beyond simple chains.
Performance ‚Üí Agents can be slow/expensive if not optimized (tool overuse, excessive prompts).
Still evolving ‚Üí APIs change quickly; keeping up with updates is necessary.
6. Prerequisites
Before we jump into our practicals in the next chapter, let‚Äôs talk prerequisites.
To follow along with LangChain implementations, you should ideally be comfortable with:
Python basics ‚Üí writing/understanding simple scripts.
pip ‚Üí installing Python packages.
Virtual environments (venv / conda) ‚Üí optional but useful to keep projects isolated.
Jupyter / Google Colab ‚Üí running Python code in notebooks.
If you‚Äôre new, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî this module series will provide ready-to-use Google Colab notebooks alongside the explanations. That way, you don‚Äôt need to set up a full dev environment on your laptop right away.
Next Build your own GenAI-powered HR research assistant!
In this hands-on guide, you‚Äôll see exactly how to connect Google Gemini and DuckDuckGo using LangChain which would fetch real-time news, summarize topics, and create modular AI chains in minutes.
Curious how it works? Don‚Äôt miss this practical walkthrough!
