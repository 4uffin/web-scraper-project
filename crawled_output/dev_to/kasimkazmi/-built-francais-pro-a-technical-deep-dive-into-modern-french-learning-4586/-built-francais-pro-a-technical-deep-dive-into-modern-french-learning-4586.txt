# 🛠️ Built Français Pro: A Technical Deep Dive into Modern French Learning
#nextjs
#opensource

#webdev
When your friend needs a solution, you don't just recommend tools - you build them.
My friend's Canadian PR timeline was tight. Existing French learning platforms were either expensive or poorly architected. So I did what any dev would do: built a better one from scratch.
⚡ The Technical Challenge
Create a production-ready French learning platform optimized for Canadian immigration with modern web technologies.
The Stack:
Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Firebase (Firestore + Auth)
Deployment: Vercel
Styling: shadcn/ui + Radix UI
Performance: Server Components + Bundle Optimization
Enter fullscreen mode

Technical Achievements
Performance Optimization:
• 60% bundle size reduction through strategic code splitting
• Server Components for optimal hydration
• 95+ Lighthouse scores across all metrics
• Sub-2s initial page load
Architecture Decisions:
• React Server Components for SEO-critical pages
• Client Components only where interactivity is needed
• Real-time progress sync with Firestore
• Optimistic UI updates for smooth UX
Developer Experience:
• Full TypeScript coverage with strict typing
• Component-based architecture with shadcn/ui
• Reusable UI system with Tailwind CSS
• Accessibility-first design patterns
Interesting Implementation Details
Web Speech API Integration:
Built custom audio controls using the Web Speech API for pronunciation practice. Users can click any French text to hear native pronunciation:
const speakText = async () => {
if ('speechSynthesis' in window) {
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
utterance.lang = 'fr-FR';
utterance.rate = 0.8;
utterance.pitch = 1;
utterance.volume = 0.8;
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
}
};

Exit fullscreen mode
Progress Tracking System:
Real-time sync between client and Firestore with comprehensive progress tracking:
interface UserStats {
userId: string;
totalLessonsCompleted: number;
totalXP: number;
currentStreak: number;
longestStreak: number;
averageScore: number;
timeSpent: number;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Express Entry Integration:
Built custom calculators for Canadian immigration requirements:
// CLB Calculator for language proficiency
const CLB_CONVERSION = {
'Reading': {
0: { clb: 0, level: 'No proficiency', color: 'bg-red-500' },
181: { clb: 4, level: 'Basic', color: 'bg-orange-500' },
// ... more thresholds
}
};

🎨 Design System & Architecture Patterns
1. Component Architecture:
Atomic Design: UI components follow atomic design principles
Compound Components: Complex components like modals use compound patterns
Render Props: Flexible components that accept render functions
Custom Hooks: Business logic separated into reusable hooks
2. State Management Strategy:
// Context-based state management with custom hooks
const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);
// Custom hook for type-safe context usage
export function useAuth() {
const ctx = useContext(AuthContext);
if (!ctx) throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
return ctx;
}

Exit fullscreen mode
3. Layout Architecture:
Three-Column Layout: Left sidebar (navigation) + Main content + Right sidebar (quick access)
Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
Sticky Navigation: Fixed header with smooth scrolling
Progressive Enhancement: Works without JavaScript, enhanced with it
4. Data Flow Architecture:
User Action → Custom Hook → Firebase Service → Context Update → UI Re-render

Component → useProgress → progress.ts → AuthContext → Real-time UI

🔧 Technical Implementation Patterns
1. Server/Client Component Strategy:
// Server Component for SEO-critical pages
export default async function LessonPage({ params }) {
const lesson = await fetchLesson(params.id); // Server-side data fetching
return <InteractiveLessonClient initialData={lesson} />; // Client component
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Custom Hook Pattern:
// Progress tracking with real-time updates
export function useProgress() {
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();
const [progress, setProgress] = useState<UserProgress | null>(null);
// Real-time Firebase integration
const loadProgress = useCallback(async () => {
if (!isAuthenticated || !user) return;
const userProgress = await getUserProgress(user.uid);
setProgress(userProgress);
}, [isAuthenticated, user]);
return { progress, loading, error, updateLesson };
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Context Provider Composition:
// Nested context providers for different concerns
<AuthProvider>
<UserStorageProvider>
<AdminProvider>
<FavoritesProvider>
<SearchProvider>
{children}
</SearchProvider>
</FavoritesProvider>
</AdminProvider>
</UserStorageProvider>
</AuthProvider>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🚀 Performance Architecture
1. Code Splitting Strategy:
Route-based splitting: Each page loads only necessary code
Component-based splitting: Heavy components loaded on demand
Dynamic imports: React.lazy() for non-critical components
2. Bundle Optimization:
Tree shaking: Unused code eliminated at build time
Turbopack: Next.js 15's fast bundler for development
Image optimization: Next.js automatic image optimization
3. Caching Strategy:
Static generation: Pre-built pages for better performance
ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration): Dynamic content with static benefits
Client-side caching: React Query for API response caching
🔒 Security & Authentication Architecture
1. Firebase Authentication:
// Centralized auth state management
interface AuthContextType {
user: AppUser | null;
isLoading: boolean;
login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
signup: (name: string, email: string, password: string) => Promise<boolean>;
loginWithGoogle: () => Promise<boolean>;
logout: () => void;
isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Route Protection:
AuthGuard component: Protects authenticated routes
Role-based access: Admin vs user permissions
Client-side validation: Immediate feedback for auth errors
Mobile-First Architecture
1. Responsive Design System:
Breakpoint strategy: Mobile-first with progressive enhancement
Touch optimization: Mobile-friendly interactions
PWA capabilities: Service worker for offline functionality
2. Performance on Mobile:
Critical CSS: Above-the-fold styles inlined
Lazy loading: Images and components loaded on demand
Bundle size: Optimized for slower mobile connections
Live Demo: Frenchpro.ca
Source Code: Open source on GitHub
Question for the community: What's your go-to pattern for handling real-time data in educational apps? Always curious about different approaches to state synchronization!
Building solutions for real problems hits different. Sometimes the best side projects come from helping friends.
