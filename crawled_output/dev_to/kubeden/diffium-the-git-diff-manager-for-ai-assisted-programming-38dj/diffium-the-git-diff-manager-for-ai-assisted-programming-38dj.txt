Diffium: The git diff manager for ai-assisted programming
#git

Hey all! How's everyone doing?
Listen.. I decided I want to maintain a repository for the first time in my life for this year's #hacktoberfest, so I decided to scaffold an idea I had and make it accessible.
So, if any of you friendly people feel like you wanna do some Go programming, feel free to check out diffium -- https://github.com/interpretive-systems/diffium
Also, who knows - maybe you'll get to start using the tool too haha.. I mean, honestly, I think it's quite nice and it's actually the first tool I build for myself that I actually use every day lol
