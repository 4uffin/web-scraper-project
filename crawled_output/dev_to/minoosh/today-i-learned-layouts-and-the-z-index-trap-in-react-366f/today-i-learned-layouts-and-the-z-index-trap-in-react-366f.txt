Today I Learned: Layouts and the Z-Index Trap in React
#webdev
#react
#layout
#css
Sometimes, what seems ‚Äúsimple‚Äù in front-end development can surprise you in the best way ‚Äî a little challenge, a little learning. Today, I ran into a couple of tricky issues while building my React app with a sticky Navbar and shared Layout. Here‚Äôs what happened and what I learned.
Layouts make life way easier
I wanted my Navbar and Footer to show up on every page without having to copy them into every component. That‚Äôs where a Layout component really saved me.
export default function Layout({ children }) {
return (
<div className="font-sans">
<Navbar />
{/* stays the same across pages */}
{children}
{/* page-specific content */}
<Footer />
{/* stays the same across pages */}
</div>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then, for each page route, I just wrapped it in the Layout:
<Route path="/team" element={<Layout><Team /></Layout>} />
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
‚úÖ The best part? I don‚Äôt have to copy <Navbar /> or <Footer /> everywhere. Any update I make to them automatically shows up on all pages ‚Äî clean, efficient, and it feels so good seeing it just work.
2.The z-index surprise
Even with the Layout set up, I noticed a small hiccup: my Navbar wasn‚Äôt clickable in some areas.
I had this CSS:
<section className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full z-10">...</section>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I thought, ‚Äúz-10? That should put me on top of everything!‚Äù ‚Äî not quite. But it was actually a great little puzzle.
Here‚Äôs why:
z-index only works within the same stacking context.
If a parent or sibling element has position set and a higher z-index, it can cover your Navbar, even if your Navbar has z-10.
Transparent elements can also block clicks if they‚Äôre sitting above your Navbar.
How I fixed it:
Made sure no parent element created a higher stacking context.
Bumped the Navbar z-index up:
z-[9999]
Adjusted parent elements so the stacking order made sense.
‚úÖ After that, my Navbar links were fully clickable, and the Layout worked perfectly ‚Äî such a satisfying little win!
*** Lessons Learned ***
Layout components are a total lifesaver ‚Äî putting shared stuff like Navbar/Footer in one place makes your life so much easier.
z-index doesn‚Äôt automatically put you on top ‚Äî understanding stacking contexts and parent/sibling elements is key.
Even invisible or transparent elements can block clicks ‚Äî good reminder to always check the layering.
üí° Small CSS hiccups can be tricky, but each one is a chance to learn and improve. Today reminded me that debugging UI is just as rewarding as writing the code itself ‚Äî and seeing it all work perfectly at the end is the best feeling!

CSS knows how to humble developers üòÇüòÇ, I faced my own struggle with it yesterday trying to use clamp(), I just left it for now. Didn't consider stacking context before, that's a new thing I have learnt, thanks for sharing

Haha, for sure! CSS has a way of keeping us humble üòÖ. I‚Äôve wrestled with clamp() myself. It looks straightforward but definitely takes some tinkering. Glad the stacking context bit clicked for you!
