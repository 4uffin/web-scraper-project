NutriLens AI: Personalized Nutrition Analyzer Using Gemini's Multimodal Magic 🍎✨

Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
NutriLens AI is a personalized nutrition analyzer that revolutionizes how people understand their meals. Unlike generic calorie counters, it considers WHO you are - your age, gender, lifestyle, health goals, and medical conditions - to provide truly personalized nutrition insights.
The Problem It Solves:
67% of adults struggle to track nutrition accurately
Generic apps give same advice to everyone - a diabetic senior and teenage athlete get identical analysis
Manual food logging takes 10+ minutes per meal
Parents guess if their children's portions are appropriate
People with health conditions need personalized guidance but can't afford nutritionists
The Solution:
Simply photograph any meal and get instant, personalized nutrition analysis tailored to YOUR specific needs. A 7-year-old child, a pregnant woman, and a bodybuilder will get completely different insights for the same meal - that's the power of contextual AI.

How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Gemini 1.5 Flash through Google AI Studio to create a sophisticated multimodal analysis system:
Multimodal Features
Gemini 1.5 Flash Model - For rapid image analysis.
Multimodal Processing - Simultaneous image + text understanding.
Structured Output - JSON responses for precise data extraction.
Context Awareness - Personalized analysis based on user profiles.
Google Cloud Run - Seamless deployment and scaling.
Built with ❤️ using Google AI Studio's Gemini API for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge 2025
