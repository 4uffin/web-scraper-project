How to Deploy NiceGUI Apps with Docker on Sliplane
#docker
#devops
#webdev
#python
NiceGUI is a fantastic Python framework for creating web-based user interfaces with ease. If you've built a NiceGUI app and want to deploy it without the complexity of managing servers, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, I'll show you how to containerize and deploy your NiceGUI application on Sliplane.
Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have:
A NiceGUI application ready to deploy
Docker installed on your local machine (for testing)
A GitHub repository with your NiceGUI code
A Sliplane account
Step 1: Prepare Your NiceGUI Application
First, let's make sure your NiceGUI app is production-ready. Here's a basic example of a NiceGUI application:
from nicegui import ui
@ui.page('/')
def index():
ui.label('Hello NiceGUI World!')
ui.button('Click me!', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('Button clicked!'))
if __name__ in {"__main__", "__mp_main__"}:
ui.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, reload=False)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Key points for production deployment:
Set host='0.0.0.0' to accept connections from outside the container
Use any port you prefer (Sliplane auto-detects ports)
Set reload=False for production stability
Use the if __name__ check to prevent issues with container restarts
Step 2: Create the Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile in your project root:
FROM zauberzeug/nicegui:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "main.py"]
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This Dockerfile:
Uses the latest official NiceGUI base image (check Docker Hub for specific versions if needed)
Installs your dependencies from requirements.txt
Copies your application code
Exposes port 8080
Runs your main application file
Step 3: Create Requirements File
Create a requirements.txt file with your dependencies:
nicegui
# Add any other dependencies your app needs
# For example:
# pandas
# requests
# matplotlib
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Add Docker Ignore File
Create a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files:
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.git
.gitignore
README.md
.pytest_cache
.coverage
venv/
env/
.venv/
.env/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 5: Test Locally
Before deploying, test your container locally:
# Build the image
docker build -t my-nicegui-app .
# Run the container
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-nicegui-app
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Visit http://localhost:8080 to verify your app works correctly in the container.
Step 6: Deploy on Sliplane
Now for the easy part! Here's how to deploy your NiceGUI app on Sliplane:
Sign up for Sliplane (first 2 days free)
Connect your GitHub repository by clicking "Create Service" and selecting your repository
Configure your service:
Service name: my-nicegui-app (or your preferred name)
Keep other settings as default (Sliplane auto-detects ports)
Click Deploy and wait about 2-3 minutes
Access your app at https://my-nicegui-app.sliplane.app
That's it! Your NiceGUI app is now live and accessible worldwide.
Automatic Updates
Whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository, Sliplane automatically rebuilds and deploys your application. No manual intervention required.

FAQ
Q: Can I run multiple NiceGUI apps on one server?
A: Yes! Sliplane allows unlimited containers per server. Deploy multiple NiceGUI apps and they'll share the server resources.
Q: Does NiceGUI work well in containers?
A: Absolutely. NiceGUI was designed with containerization in mind and works perfectly with Docker.
Q: How do I handle file uploads?
A: Use NiceGUI's built-in upload component and save files to a persistent volume mounted at /data.
Q: Can I use external APIs?
A: Yes, NiceGUI apps can make HTTP requests to external APIs. Store API keys as environment variables in Sliplane.
