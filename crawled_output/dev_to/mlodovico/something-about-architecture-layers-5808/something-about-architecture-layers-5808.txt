Something about Architecture: Layers

Hey there! I hope you're having a great day. Today, I want to share an article about a fascinating topic that's been getting a lot of attention lately.
The field of software architecture is still evolving and relatively new, requiring ongoing research and development. The discussion around this definition is extensive, with many different points of view.
Itâ€™s an engineering concept, where this model can be seen as encompassing different types of architectures that serve as resources, with the primary goal of maximizing performance and development productivity.
In this time we will talk about Layers:
This architecture is structured around clearly defined responsibilities, resulting in isolated layers with distinct purposes. Each layer can be reused across different levels of the system or even seamlessly replaced, enhancing flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.
The concept of layers is not new; it was widely applied long before becoming popular in software engineering. This organizational model has proven its significance across different domains of computing, serving as a foundation for the construction of complex and standardized systems.
Some of the most notable examples include:
OSI Model: developed in the 1970s and consolidated in the 1980s as the reference framework for communication protocols in computer networks. Its seven-layer structure established a conceptual foundation for interoperability and the evolution of networking technologies.
Operating Systems: the layered approach enabled the standardization and continuous improvement of operating systems. By structuring responsibilities across levels â€” from CPU and memory management to devices, kernel, and applications â€” this model fostered modularity, portability, and system stability.
The layered architecture typically consists of three layers: presentation, application, and data.
Presentation: layer is responsible for the user interface â€” what the end user interacts with. It displays information, collects input, and sends requests to the application layer.
Application: processes user inputs, applies business rules, and manages data flow across the system. It executes operations and computations, coordinates interactions between layers, and defines the overall system behavior.
Data: manages everything related to information storage, retrieval, and updates. It controls database operations, provides data to the application on demand, and ensures both integrity and persistence of information.
Advantages
Clear organization: Each part of the code has a well-defined responsibility, which improves readability and makes the system easier to understand.
Reusability: Layers can be reused in different contexts or applications, reducing duplication and fostering consistency across the system.
Flexibility: A layer can be replaced or updated without significantly impacting the others (e.g., switching the database engine), enabling adaptability to new technologies.
Ease of maintenance: Bugs and improvements are more localized, which accelerates troubleshooting, testing, and overall software evolution.
Disadvantages
Performance overhead: An excessive number of layers may introduce unnecessary calls and complexity, which can degrade system performance.
Added complexity: For small projects, the layered approach might be considered over-engineering, adding structure where simplicity would suffice.
Hierarchical rigidity: Communication must follow the layer order strictly, which can increase verbosity and reduce the speed of certain operations.
Conclusion
The layered software architecture remains a cornerstone in software engineering, valued for its modularity, clarity, and adaptability. Despite limitations such as performance concerns and rigid communication flows, its structured approach provides strong support for building maintainable and scalable systems.
In small applications, lightweight models may be more suitable, but in enterprise and large-scale contexts, layered architecture continues to be a robust and effective paradigm.
I hope this article was helpful in some wayâ€”happy coding! ðŸš€
