Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
The Vision Behind DreamNest.ai - AI-Powered Home Designer & Marketplace
As someone passionate about democratizing design and making home planning accessible to everyone, my goal with this submission is to showcase the transformative power of Google AI Studio and demonstrate how its multimodal Gemini capabilities can revolutionize the home design industry. DreamNest.ai is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that transforms simple user requirements into complete, visualized home design packages - proving that sophisticated architectural visualization is no longer limited to expensive design firms.
Home design has always been an exclusive, expensive process requiring specialized knowledge and professional expertise. Most people struggle to visualize their dream home from basic floor plans or communicate their vision effectively to architects. I wanted to build something that breaks down these barriers - an intuitive, accessible platform that lets anyone input their requirements and instantly receive professional-quality design assets including photorealistic renderings, detailed blueprints, immersive video tours, and curated shopping lists.
In exploring Google AI Studio and its multimodal models, I discovered they can dramatically streamline the entire design workflow:
🏠 Generate photorealistic home renderings from simple text descriptions using Imagen 4.0, producing both exterior and interior visualizations that rival professional architectural renders
House' Front View
House's view from Inside
📐 Create detailed 2D and 3D floor plans with AI-generated blueprints and dollhouse-style cutaway views that help users understand spatial relationships
🎬 Produce cinematic 3D video tours using Veo 2.0 that provide immersive walkthroughs of the designed spaces
🗣️ Generate eloquent voice-guided walkthroughs with Gemini 2.5 Flash that describe the home's features in compelling, real estate agent style
🛍️ Curate personalized shopping lists with structured JSON output that matches furniture and decor to the home's architectural style
⚡ Deliver instant results through parallel processing of multiple AI models, providing a complete design package in minutes rather than weeks
🎨 Maintain design coherence across all generated assets by using consistent prompts and style guidelines throughout the generation pipeline
This submission demonstrates that Google AI Studio isn't just a research tool but a practical platform for building production-ready applications that can disrupt traditional industries and make professional services accessible to everyone.
Through a comprehensive technical implementation, I hope to inspire developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to explore multimodal AI for creating tools that genuinely democratize expertise and empower users to bring their visions to life.

const generateDesignAssets = async (formData: FormData): Promise<DesignAssets> => {
const basePrompt = generatePrompt(formData);
// Parallel text generation with Gemini 2.5 Flash
const [walkthroughScript, shoppingList] = await Promise.all([
generateWalkthroughScript(basePrompt),
generateShoppingList(basePrompt), // Uses structured JSON output
]);
// Image generation with Imagen 4.0
const images = await generateImages(basePrompt);
// Floor plan generation (2D and 3D)
const [plan2D, plan3D] = await Promise.all([
generate2DPlan(basePrompt),
generate3DPlan(basePrompt),
]);
// Video generation with Veo 2.0 (rate-limited)
