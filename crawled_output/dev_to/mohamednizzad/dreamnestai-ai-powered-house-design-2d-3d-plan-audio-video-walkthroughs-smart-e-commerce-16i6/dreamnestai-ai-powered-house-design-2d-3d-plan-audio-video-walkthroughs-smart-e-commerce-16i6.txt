Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
The Vision Behind DreamNest.ai - AI-Powered Home Designer & Marketplace
As someone passionate about democratizing design and making home planning accessible to everyone, my goal with this submission is to showcase the transformative power of Google AI Studio and demonstrate how its multimodal Gemini capabilities can revolutionize the home design industry. DreamNest.ai is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that transforms simple user requirements into complete, visualized home design packages - proving that sophisticated architectural visualization is no longer limited to expensive design firms.
Home design has always been an exclusive, expensive process requiring specialized knowledge and professional expertise. Most people struggle to visualize their dream home from basic floor plans or communicate their vision effectively to architects. I wanted to build something that breaks down these barriers - an intuitive, accessible platform that lets anyone input their requirements and instantly receive professional-quality design assets including photorealistic renderings, detailed blueprints, immersive video tours, and curated shopping lists.
In exploring Google AI Studio and its multimodal models, I discovered they can dramatically streamline the entire design workflow:
üè† Generate photorealistic home renderings from simple text descriptions using Imagen 4.0, producing both exterior and interior visualizations that rival professional architectural renders
House' Front View
House's view from Inside
üìê Create detailed 2D and 3D floor plans with AI-generated blueprints and dollhouse-style cutaway views that help users understand spatial relationships
üé¨ Produce cinematic 3D video tours using Veo 2.0 that provide immersive walkthroughs of the designed spaces
üó£Ô∏è Generate eloquent voice-guided walkthroughs with Gemini 2.5 Flash that describe the home's features in compelling, real estate agent style
üõçÔ∏è Curate personalized shopping lists with structured JSON output that matches furniture and decor to the home's architectural style
‚ö° Deliver instant results through parallel processing of multiple AI models, providing a complete design package in minutes rather than weeks
üé® Maintain design coherence across all generated assets by using consistent prompts and style guidelines throughout the generation pipeline
This submission demonstrates that Google AI Studio isn't just a research tool but a practical platform for building production-ready applications that can disrupt traditional industries and make professional services accessible to everyone.
Through a comprehensive technical implementation, I hope to inspire developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to explore multimodal AI for creating tools that genuinely democratize expertise and empower users to bring their visions to life.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What I Built
DreamNest.ai is a comprehensive AI-powered home design platform that transforms the traditional architectural design process. Instead of requiring expensive consultations, technical drawings, and weeks of back-and-forth communication, users can simply input their requirements through an intuitive form and receive a complete design package within minutes.
The platform solves the critical problem of design accessibility and visualization. It addresses:
Visualization Gap: Most people can't interpret technical blueprints or imagine spaces from 2D plans
Cost Barrier: Professional architectural visualization is expensive and time-consuming
Communication Challenge: Translating personal vision into technical requirements is difficult
Decision Paralysis: Without seeing options, users struggle to make design decisions
The experience DreamNest creates is one of empowerment and inspiration. By transforming complex architectural concepts into beautiful, understandable visuals, it helps users make confident decisions about their most important investment - their home.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How I Used Google AI Studio
Google AI Studio Usage Demo
Multi-Model Orchestration Strategy
The entire DreamNest platform is built around a sophisticated orchestration of multiple Google AI Studio models, each optimized for specific tasks:
// Core generation pipeline using multiple Gemini models
const generateDesignAssets = async (formData: FormData): Promise<DesignAssets> => {
const basePrompt = generatePrompt(formData);
// Parallel text generation with Gemini 2.5 Flash
const [walkthroughScript, shoppingList] = await Promise.all([
generateWalkthroughScript(basePrompt),
generateShoppingList(basePrompt), // Uses structured JSON output
]);
// Image generation with Imagen 4.0
const images = await generateImages(basePrompt);
// Floor plan generation (2D and 3D)
const [plan2D, plan3D] = await Promise.all([
generate2DPlan(basePrompt),
generate3DPlan(basePrompt),
]);
// Video generation with Veo 2.0 (rate-limited)
const videoUrl = await generateVideo(basePrompt);
return { images, videoUrl, walkthroughScript, shoppingList, plan2D, plan3D };
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Model-Specific Implementations
Gemini 2.5 Flash for Structured Data:
// Shopping list generation with JSON schema
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
contents: shoppingPrompt,
config: {
responseMimeType: 'application/json',
responseSchema: {
type: Type.ARRAY,
items: {
type: Type.OBJECT,
properties: {
name: { type: Type.STRING },
description: { type: Type.STRING },
priceRange: { type: Type.STRING },
},
required: ["name", "description", "priceRange"],
},
},
},
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Imagen 4.0 for Photorealistic Renderings:
const imageResults = await Promise.all([
ai.models.generateImages({
model: 'imagen-4.0-generate-001',
prompt: `Photorealistic, ultra-detailed exterior view of ${prompt}. Cinematic lighting, 8k resolution.`,
config: { numberOfImages: 1, aspectRatio: "16:9" },
}),
ai.models.generateImages({
model: 'imagen-4.0-generate-001',
prompt: `Photorealistic interior view of living room and kitchen. Natural lighting, warm and inviting.`,
config: { numberOfImages: 1, aspectRatio: "16:9" },
})
]);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Veo 2.0 for Cinematic Video Tours:
const operation = await ai.models.generateVideos({
model: 'veo-2.0-generate-001',
prompt: `Aerial and cinematic 3D architectural walkthrough of ${prompt}. Hyperrealistic rendering.`,
config: { numberOfVideos: 1 }
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Cost Management & Rate Limiting
Implemented intelligent rate limiting for expensive operations:
// Video generation cooldown to manage API costs
const VIDEO_GENERATION_COOLDOWN_MS = 60 * 60 * 1000; // 1 hour
const lastVideoGenTimestamp = localStorage.getItem('lastVideoGenerationTimestamp');
if (timeSinceLastGen < VIDEO_GENERATION_COOLDOWN_MS) {
updateStatus(setGenerationStatus, 'Video Generation',
`Skipped: Hourly limit active. Try again in ${minutesRemaining} mins.`);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode

ATTENTION: I have unbilled this project from google account billing in order to minimize the cost. Since, unprecedented reach of this post within the publication of few hours, I have already occurred nearly $25.
Therefore, now I have made this project unbilled from my GCP hence, the live applet link mentioned above cannot be accessed. However, I have provided the demo and my work in detail.
However, if inaccessibility will adversely affect judging, kindly let me know so that I will try to find any alternative to keep it accessible live.
Over to you @ben @noahbrinker @jess
I spent several days and hours into come up with this submission and I don't want this issue hinder judging.
Thank you in advance.
