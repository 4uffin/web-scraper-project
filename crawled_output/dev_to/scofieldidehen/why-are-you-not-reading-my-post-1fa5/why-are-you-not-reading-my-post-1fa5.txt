Why Are You Not Reading My Post?
#tutorial

Anyone who writes a post, article, how-to guide, etc., does so for people to consume, and it's painful when you write and no one seems to notice, or your post gets seen by only 1 or 2 people.
If you have a blog, this is one part of the journey that blog owners hardly share; for me, it is a daily task, figuring out what to post and what readers will be interested in seeing.
The amount of research that goes into it, and sometimes you end up writing, only to have it receive zero interactions. I remember feeling that my network was bad or the algorithm was flawed, as I kept reloading, hoping to see even one like or comment after spending weeks developing the content.
I know how draining that can be because I am still in the trenches of getting more readers to interact with my content.
Many blog owners are churning out AI-generated content with little regard for authenticity. The focus is to push out more posts, populate their blogs, and then buy backlinks to boost traffic.
As I mused about how to crack this invisible code, I figured throwing it out here for anyone and everyone to share their opinion was a good way to start.
Why are you here?
What do you enjoy reading?
Give me one person, a platform you enjoy reading from?
Please share what drives you here, and let's keep this going.
Have a great weekend.

I usually write only when two conditions are met: I’m in the mood, and I actually have something to share. It’s not about the number of views or reactions—if even one reader finds the post useful, that already feels like success

True, but when your focus is to reach more people and generate content that leads to conversation, then writing becomes a task.
Yes?

Dunno, It is not like you can not have a tech conversation without many followers you can always join some discord for that. On the other hand, if you want to reach more people, your content should be entertaining and valuable enough to make others want to appreciate or discuss it. Following trends wont give you much result, so writing for yourself is more preferable. Ignore others and focus on developing yourself))

Yeah😁, honestly I must say that after reading your post, sometimes I feel like there are more bots or fake accounts here than developers. I don't know if you felt that or not? Maybe I misunderstood, that's why the number of likes goes up but no one comments or there are very few. But you shouldn't be disappointed

How-to seem to be the best post on dev for a while.
Technical guide as well was very cool for a while but it seem many people just rely on AI now.
So I think opinion pieces are the go to right now.

I am here mostly for myself, or at least, it started that way anyway.
Making my Dev Logs for myself to read back through and it helps keep my sanity on my dev journey (barely). I have a few followers, so I guess I also write for them now too, but even if all my followers left or no one read my logs, I would keep posting for my own benefit.
If others get any kind of enjoyment or benefit from it, that is great too.
I do read through other posts on this site, anything that catches my eye or my interest, very rarely respond or comment to other posts but do usually leave a like on any post that I read and learn something, just enjoy or it is a relatable subject.
Good luck to you, my thoughts, sometimes writing for your own benefit should be the priority and if others enjoy it , that is a bonus.

You write some really nice blogs. Keep going and don't get demotivated as these are not really something you should consider much. Write for yourself.

Content alone won’t get you far, push it where your readers already are. Forget algorithm magic; build a micro-network of genuinely interested people.

Really something that teaches me something new, and when I am in the mood. I also like having a demo of the topic, as dense text with no pictures can be dull. Even emojis can help sparce things up.

I’ve spent the past 9 years working in artificial intelligence, with a focus on computer vision and deep learning. Most of my work revolves around teaching machines to recognize and understand people.
