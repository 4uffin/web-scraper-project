Stop Falling for the ‚ÄòHow I Made $$$ in 10 Days‚Äô Trap
#career

Everywhere you look, someone is claiming they made $10K in 30 days or built a six-figure side hustle in 90 days.
On platforms like LinkedIn, X, Medium, and Dev.to, these posts spread like wildfire. They come with glossy headlines, vague success stories, and just enough mystery to make you wonder if you‚Äôre missing out.
That‚Äôs the trap.
In tech, this FOMO-driven content isn‚Äôt new. Whether it‚Äôs crypto trading, AI side hustles, Web3 gigs, or the next big DevOps certification, the message is the same: you‚Äôre falling behind if you‚Äôre not already cashing in.
It taps into the anxiety of working in a fast-moving industry where yesterday‚Äôs hot skill is today‚Äôs old news.
Why It Works
The psychology is simple. These posts sell hope without detail. They‚Äôre written to be aspirational but intentionally light on substance. They hint at a ‚Äúsecret formula,‚Äù but never really give you a roadmap.
Instead, they leave you chasing the next post, the next newsletter, the next course.
On LinkedIn, they look like personal success stories. On Medium, they‚Äôre rebranded as ‚Äúcase studies.‚Äù On Dev, they take the shape of tutorials that promise overnight results. The format changes, but the effect is the same: they stoke your fear of missing out while offering little real value.
The Problem With the 90-Day Fantasy
Tech doesn‚Äôt reward shortcuts. You don‚Äôt become a senior developer in three months. You don‚Äôt master blockchain security in a weekend course. And you certainly don‚Äôt build generational wealth just because you bought into the latest AI side hustle playbook.
The truth is that meaningful growth in tech takes time, focus, and persistence. But that‚Äôs not a message that goes viral. A post titled ‚ÄúI Spent 2 Years Grinding Before I Landed My First Big Break‚Äù doesn‚Äôt rack up the same engagement as a shiny ‚ÄúI made $100K in 90 days‚Äù headline.
What Readers Should Do Instead
If you want to avoid falling into the FOMO trap, ask yourself three questions every time you see one of these posts:
Is there actual proof or just a catchy headline?
Am I learning something actionable, or just getting hyped up?
Does this align with my own path in tech, or is it just noise?
Platforms thrive on engagement. LinkedIn rewards stories that make you stop scrolling. Medium boosts posts with drama in the title. Dev pushes content that promises easy wins. But your growth doesn‚Äôt come from chasing viral posts; it comes from consistent learning, real projects, and steady progress.
The Real Flex
The real flex isn‚Äôt making money fast. It‚Äôs building a skill set that keeps you relevant in an industry that moves at lightning speed. It‚Äôs contributing to open source, shipping meaningful projects, understanding the fundamentals, and creating solutions that last.
So the next time you see a ‚ÄúHow I made $$$ in 90 days‚Äù post, pause. Don‚Äôt fall for the trap. Use it as motivation, sure, but don‚Äôt mistake it for a roadmap.
Because in tech, the long game is the only game worth playing.

I used to fall for this a lot back then, until I cane to the realization that things take time. There's a process to follow, you can't skip it in 2 months, you have to go through it, and build yourself

It's all I see on Medium, hardly see real how-to anymore, just make money online, and it's tiring as it leads nowhere.
I think we are losing our humanity as everyone is chasing the bag, and less interaction due to AI doing most of the technical jobs
