Hidden Realms: AI-Powered Find the Hidden Objects Game

Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
üéÆ What I Built
What if you could create your own hidden-object game choose the art style, design the scene, and even decide how the clues are delivered? üéÆ‚ú®
That‚Äôs exactly what I built entirely with Google AI Studio for the Multimodal Challenge: a game called Hidden Realms where the player is also the creator. Without writing code at that üò±
Unlike traditional hidden object games that come pre-packaged with a limited number of scenes, art styles, and objects, Hidden Realms gives full creative control to the player.
Want a mystical forest in watercolor? ‚úÖ
A sci-fi spaceship interior in cyberpunk neon? ‚úÖ
Or even a simple dining hall in oil-painting style? ‚úÖ
With this applet, the player becomes the creator, customizing the scene, environment, and art style before diving into the hidden-object challenge.
This idea came from my 13-year-old sister, who loves hidden-object games but was frustrated that she had to download multiple versions just to enjoy different art styles or scenes. She imagined a game where players control both the look and the experience and Hidden Realms brings that vision to life.
üé• Demo
Watch the gameplay demo here:
Try out your imagination : It isn't just fun to watch its more fun to play.
Watercolor art mystical library
Pixel art Dinning Room
Realistic Modern Room
SteamPunk MysteryRoom
not just these consider making your own imaginative world to wonder around and play with
How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio to build Hidden Realms. Here‚Äôs how I used it:
Scene Generation with Imagen 4.0:
Transformed text prompts like "A mystical library inside a giant tree" into rich, high-quality visual scenes.
Created immersive game boards instantly, without manual artwork.
Object Detection & Hint Creation with Gemini 2.5 Flash:
Analyzed the generated scene to detect hidden objects.
Generated creative hints for each object.
Provided precise coordinates in structured JSON, enabling automatic game logic.
Speech Hints using Browser Web Speech API:
Converted the AI-generated hints into spoken audio for a dynamic, interactive experience.
Enhanced immersion and accessibility for players.
Build Studio & One-Click Deployment:
The entire codebase was generated automatically using Google AI Studio‚Äôs Build feature, so I didn‚Äôt have to write any manual code.
Deployment was completed in one click using the Studio‚Äôs deploy feature, launching the application on Cloud Run instantly.
This seamless workflow allowed the game to run online immediately, without complex setup or configuration.
Multimodal Features
The app‚Äôs multimodal AI capabilities make the game smart, interactive, and engaging:
Text ‚Üí Image (Scene Generation):
Imagen 4.0 turns written descriptions into detailed, immersive game worlds.
Image + Text ‚Üí JSON (Object Detection & Clues):
Gemini 2.5 Flash identifies objects, names them, creates playful hints, and provides bounding boxes.
Converts static images into fully interactive game boards automatically.
Text ‚Üí Audio (Speech Hints):
Browser reads AI-generated hints aloud using Web Speech API.
Adds an audio layer that enhances accessibility and engagement.
Seamless Multimodal Integration:
Combines vision, language, and structured data to create a game that feels alive.
Players enjoy a rich experience with visually stunning scenes, intelligent object recognition, and interactive audio guidance.
Effortless Build & Deployment:
Using Build Studio, all code was auto-generated by the coding assistant.
One-click deployment via Google AI Studio ensures the application runs on Cloud Run instantly, making it easy to share and play anywhere.
üöÄ Why It‚Äôs Different
Traditional hidden object games are:
Fixed in style üé®
Limited in number of scenes üåç
Pre-defined in difficulty ‚öñÔ∏è
Hidden Realms breaks those boundaries:
Infinite scenes, environments, and styles to explore.
Player-driven imagination as the game‚Äôs core.
Dynamic difficulty based on hints and object placement.
Unlike most game projects that take time to configure, package, and deploy, Hidden Realms was live in seconds thanks to Cloud Run. That means faster iteration, easier sharing, and almost no friction in testing new features.
This makes the game endlessly replayable and tailored to each player‚Äôs creativity.
üîÆ Future Enhancements
Looking ahead, here are some exciting ways AI could push this further:
üïπÔ∏è Adaptive Difficulty ‚Üí AI could adjust difficulty based on player performance.
üåê Multiplayer Mode ‚Üí Challenge friends to find objects in the same generated world.
üì± Cross-Device Play ‚Üí Extend gameplay seamlessly across mobile, VR, and AR.
üé≠ Character Integration ‚Üí Add NPCs generated by AI to provide interactive clues.
üß† Personalized Narratives ‚Üí AI weaves a storyline around the hidden-object gameplay for RPG-like immersion.
üïπÔ∏è AI + Gaming: A New Era
Hidden Realms is just one example of how AI can transform gaming. Beyond just automation and tools, AI is enabling creative co-design, where players become creators.
I believe AI will reshape the future of gaming by:
Enabling infinite replayability through procedural + AI generation.
Supporting personalized gaming experiences where every player‚Äôs journey is unique.
Lowering the barrier to game development, so anyone can imagine and play their own creations.
‚ú® Final Thoughts
What started as my sister‚Äôs simple wish‚Äî‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I choose my own scenes and art styles in hidden object games?‚Äù‚Äîturned into a working applet built in less than a day using Google AI Studio.
This project demonstrates how accessible, powerful, and fast AI game development has become. And it‚Äôs only the beginning!
I would really like to thank Google AI Studio for providing such an amazing platform where apps can be built and deployed without writing a single line of code. I would definitely suggest to try Google Ai Studio, and bring your imagine to life.
And a big thanks to the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge for giving me the opportunity to try something so imaginative and bring it to life. üöÄ.
