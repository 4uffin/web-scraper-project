Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
MediVision Assistant - An AI-powered healthcare companion that makes medical assistance accessible to everyone, especially those with visual impairments or accessibility needs. The app combines computer vision, voice recognition, and AI chat to provide comprehensive health monitoring and assistance.
Key Features:
üñºÔ∏è AI Skin Analysis - Upload photos and videos for instant skin condition assessment
üé® AI Health Infographics - Generate professional medical infographics using Imagen 4.0
üé§ Voice Symptom Logger - Record and transcribe health symptoms using speech-to-text
üíä Medication Scanner - OCR-powered medication identification and management
üí¨ AI Health Chat - Conversational AI for health questions and guidance
üîó Seamless Analysis-to-Chat Integration - Continue conversations with AI based on analysis results
‚ôø Full Accessibility Support - Voice navigation, screen reader compatibility, high contrast mode
üì± Progressive Web App - Works offline, installable on any device

Voice Logger: Voice-to-text symptom recording with transcription
Health Chat: Conversational AI for health questions
AI Health Infographics: Professional medical infographics
Health Records
Accessibility Features: Comprehensive accessibility toolbar with voice navigation
How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio extensively to power the multimodal capabilities:
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Skin Analysis (Image + Video)
Integrated Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze uploaded skin photos and videos
Provides detailed assessments of skin conditions, moles, rashes, and other dermatological concerns
Supports video analysis for dynamic skin condition monitoring and movement patterns
Returns structured health insights with confidence scores and recommendations
Supports multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM) up to 25MB
2. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Health Chat
Powers the conversational AI health assistant
Processes natural language health questions and provides evidence-based responses
Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
3. Imagen 4.0 for Health Infographics
Integrated Google Imagen 4.0 for professional medical infographic generation
Creates medication schedules, health progress charts, and symptom tracking visuals
Generates accessible, high-contrast infographics with professional medical styling
Supports download and sharing of AI-generated health content
Uses latest Imagen for cutting-edge image generation
4. Multimodal Integration
Combined text, image, video, voice, and AI-generated visual content for comprehensive health monitoring
Multimodal Features
üé• Video + Text Analysis (Skin Analysis Page)
Video Skin Monitoring: Users upload videos for dynamic skin condition analysis and movement patterns
Symptom Documentation: Video recordings of skin symptoms for detailed medical assessment
üñºÔ∏è Image + Text Analysis
Skin Photo Analysis: Users upload photos of skin conditions, and Gemini analyzes them for potential health concerns
Medication OCR: Scans medication labels and bottles to extract drug information, dosages, and instructions
üé§ Voice + Text Processing
Voice Symptom Logger: Records audio descriptions of symptoms and converts them to structured text
Voice Navigation: Complete app navigation using voice commands ("go home", "skin analysis", "emergency")
Audio Feedback: Text-to-speech responses for accessibility
üí¨ Conversational AI
Contextual Health Chat: AI remembers previous conversations and provides personalized health guidance
Seamless Analysis Integration: After any analysis (skin, medication, voice logger), users can click "Discuss with AI Assistant" to continue the conversation with full context of their analysis results
‚ôø Accessibility-First Design
Screen Reader Compatible: Full ARIA labels and semantic HTML
Voice Commands: Navigate the entire app using voice ("skin analysis", "medication scanner", "help")
High Contrast Mode: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
Font Scaling: Adjustable text size up to 300%
Keyboard Navigation: Complete app functionality without mouse
üé® AI-Generated Visual Content
Health Infographics: Professional medical charts and schedules generated by Imagen 4.0
Medication Schedules: Visual medication timing and dosage charts
Progress Tracking: Health milestone and achievement visualizations
Symptom Charts: Color-coded symptom monitoring and tracking graphics
Download & Share: Export AI-generated infographics for medical consultations
üîÑ Data Integration
Health Records: All multimodal inputs (videos, images, voice, chat, infographics) are stored and organized
Export Capabilities: Users can export their health data and AI-generated infographics for medical consultations
Video Storage: Secure video analysis results
Technical Implementation
Frontend: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
AI Integration: Google AI Studio with Gemini 2.5 Flash (video, image, text, audio) and Imagen 4.0 (infographics)
Voice Processing: Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
Image Processing: Canvas API for image optimization and preprocessing
Deployment: Google Cloud Run with automatic scaling
Database: Supabase for health records and user data
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with comprehensive testing
Impact & Accessibility
This project demonstrates how AI can make healthcare more accessible to everyone, particularly:
Visually impaired users who can navigate entirely by voice
Elderly users who may have difficulty with complex interfaces
Users with motor disabilities who rely on voice commands
Non-native speakers who can describe symptoms in their own words
The multimodal approach ensures that health monitoring is not limited by traditional input methods, making medical assistance truly inclusive.
