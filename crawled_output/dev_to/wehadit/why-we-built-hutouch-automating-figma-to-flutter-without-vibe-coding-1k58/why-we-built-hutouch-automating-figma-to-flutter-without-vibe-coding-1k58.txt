Why We Built HuTouch: Automating Figma to Flutter Without “Vibe Coding”
#programming
#discuss
#flutter
#dart
Over the past few months, I spoke with 150+ Flutter developers about their workflows.
Below themes kept coming up:
AI-generated Figma to Flutter (#F2F) code isn’t production-ready
Instead of saving time, it actually adds more work
Developers told me:
AI code often ignores project standards.
Prompts feel like “vibe coding”, random results instead of reliable scaffolding.
Repetitive boilerplate still eats up a big chunk of their week.
In short, AI hasn’t killed the boring parts of coding. It just wrapped them in a new workflow.
Why HuTouch?
We built HuTouch to fix this exact pain.
HuTouch isn’t about prompting AI, it’s about automation.
Here’s what it does differently:
Integrates with your tools (Figma, Postman & IDE) to automatically extract project specs.
Applies tried & tested community-driven blueprints (state management, coding standards, clean architecture).
Generates strong, production-ready Flutter scaffolding, without endless prompting or vibe coding.
Instead of replacing developers, HuTouch takes care of the repetitive 30-40% (scaffolding, prototyping, boilerplate) so you can focus on what matters most:
design principles
customization
complex logic
code you actually want to own
Why this matters
From those 150+ developer conversations, we found:
30-40% of a typical Flutter project goes into prototyping and boilerplate.
Developers don’t want “AI magic” that spits out random code.
They want reliable automation that respects their coding standards and lets them ship faster.
HuTouch is built around that principle: automation over prompting.
Early Beta Access:
We’re opening early beta for 50 Flutter developers this month.

Let’s Discuss
I’d love to hear from you:
What’s the most repetitive part of your current Flutter workflow?
How much of your week goes into boilerplate vs. “real” coding?
Have you tried AI-assisted coding tools, and did they actually save you time?
Drop your thoughts in the comments. We’re building HuTouch with direct feedback from the community.
