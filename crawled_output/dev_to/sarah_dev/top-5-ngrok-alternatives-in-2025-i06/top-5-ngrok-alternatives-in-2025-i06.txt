Top 5 Ngrok Alternatives in 2025

For over a decade, Ngrok has been the standard choice for developers who need to expose a local service to the internet. Whether you‚Äôre testing webhooks, demoing an app for a client, or running a quick experiment, Ngrok provides a fast way to create secure tunnels. It comes with a powerful set of features‚Äîsupport for HTTP, TCP, and TLS tunnels, request inspection, and authentication methods like OAuth and JWT.
But Ngrok isn‚Äôt always the perfect fit. Some developers find the setup too heavy for quick experiments, others run into bandwidth caps, and many simply want something more affordable. As a result, a number of alternatives have emerged, each with its own philosophy: some aim for simplicity, others for flexibility, and a few lean into open-source and self-hosted models.
Here are five alternatives in 2025 that stand out, each catering to different kinds of workflows.
1. Pinggy.io
Pinggy is perhaps the closest in spirit to ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù tunneling. Unlike Ngrok, there‚Äôs no need to download a client or create an account before starting. You just run a single SSH command, and your local app becomes accessible from the web.
What sets Pinggy apart is its unlimited bandwidth and support for UDP tunnels‚Äîsomething Ngrok still doesn‚Äôt provide. It also includes small but practical touches, like generating QR codes for tunnel URLs and providing an inspection tool directly in the terminal. Developers working across different environments (Mac, Linux, Windows, even Docker) will find it easy to integrate.
The cost is also significantly lower than Ngrok‚Äôs, with paid plans starting around \$3 per month. While it doesn‚Äôt offer advanced enterprise-level features like OAuth authentication for visitors or global load balancing, for everyday development needs it covers most bases comfortably.
When to choose Pinggy: If you want a lightweight tool for quick testing or demos, with the flexibility of UDP and no bandwidth limits.
2. LocalXpose
LocalXpose takes the opposite approach from minimalism‚Äîit‚Äôs about providing as many options as possible in a single package. Once you install the client, you can create tunnels for HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS, and even UDP traffic. It also doubles as a file server, letting you instantly share files through a tunnel, which can be surprisingly handy in collaborative settings.
Unlike command-line‚Äìonly tools, LocalXpose also provides a graphical interface. For developers who are less comfortable with terminal commands, this can make it more approachable. On the downside, you do need to install the client to get started, which may not suit those looking for zero-setup tools.
Pricing starts at around \$6 per month, and it supports features like wildcard custom domains and request-response inspection.
When to choose LocalXpose: If you need a full-featured tunneling tool with a GUI and extras like file sharing.
3. Localtunnel
Localtunnel is a long-standing project that prioritises simplicity. Distributed as an npm package, it‚Äôs particularly popular with Node.js developers because it can be installed and used directly from the development environment.
Each time you run it, Localtunnel assigns a random subdomain, and you can share your app instantly. While it lacks advanced features, no custom domains, TCP, or TLS tunnels, it‚Äôs free, open, and well-suited for testing APIs or integrations that don‚Äôt need heavy infrastructure.
Its biggest strength is integration: because it‚Äôs a Node.js package, you can script it into your workflow or even bake tunneling into your application logic.
When to choose Localtunnel: If you‚Äôre working in a Node.js environment and need a free, no-frills tool for quick web testing.
4. Zrok
Zrok represents a different philosophy: instead of a hosted SaaS model, it‚Äôs built as an open-source, self-hosted tunneling platform. Powered by OpenZiti‚Äôs zero-trust networking framework, Zrok enables both public and private resource sharing, giving teams more control over how connections are secured.
It supports HTTP, TCP, and UDP tunnels and even includes a file server. The trade-off is complexity, initial setup can be more demanding, and traffic inspection features aren‚Äôt as advanced as Ngrok‚Äôs. But for developers and organisations that prioritise security, control, or cost-free open-source tools, Zrok can be a strong choice.
When to choose Zrok: If you want an open-source, self-hosted option built on zero-trust principles.
5. Cloudflare Tunnel
Cloudflare Tunnel (formerly Argo Tunnel) is backed by Cloudflare‚Äôs global infrastructure. It connects your local apps directly to Cloudflare‚Äôs edge network, meaning you don‚Äôt need a public IP or firewall changes. Once running, traffic is routed securely through Cloudflare, shielding your service from direct exposure.
This approach makes it attractive for organizations that already use Cloudflare services like DNS, CDN, or DDoS protection. Setup involves installing and running the cloudflared daemon, which is more involved than one-command tools like Pinggy or localhost.run, but the payoff is enterprise-grade reliability and security.
Beyond just tunneling, Cloudflare Tunnel integrates with Cloudflare‚Äôs zero-trust tools, which can enforce access policies, authentication, and logging at the network edge.
When to choose Cloudflare Tunnel: If you need enterprise-level reliability and already use Cloudflare‚Äôs ecosystem.
Conclusion
Ngrok remains powerful, but the landscape in 2025 offers far more choice than just a few years ago. If your priority is speed and simplicity, tools like Pinggy or Localtunnel will get you going in seconds. For advanced features in a hosted setup, LocalXpose is hard to beat. If you prefer open-source and control, Zrok offers a zero-trust approach. And for enterprise-grade reliability, Cloudflare Tunnel stands out.
Ultimately, the ‚Äúbest‚Äù alternative depends less on raw features and more on your context. Are you demoing an app to a client, running tests across devices, or securing traffic in production? Once you know your needs, one of these tools will likely serve you better than Ngrok alone.

You seem to have missed that zrok also offers a free SaaS (zrok.io / myzrok.io), it can provide stable URLs (reserved shares), supports BYO domain/DNS, and can provide a HTTPS frontend.
