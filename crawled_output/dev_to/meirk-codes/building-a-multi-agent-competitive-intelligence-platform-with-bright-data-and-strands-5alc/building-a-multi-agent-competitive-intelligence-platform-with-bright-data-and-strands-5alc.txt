Building a Multi-Agent Competitive Intelligence Platform with Bright Data and Strands
#ai
#automation
#tutorial
How we built an AI-powered competitive intelligence system that transforms weeks of manual research into minutes of automated analysis using Strands agents and Bright Data's enterprise web scraping capabilities.
Introduction
In today's fast-paced business environment, competitive intelligence can make or break strategic decisions. Traditional approaches involve manual research, scattered data sources, and weeks of analysis. What if we could automate this entire process using AI agents that work together seamlessly?
This article walks through building a Multi-Agent Competitive Intelligence Platform that combines:
🤖 Strands Agents for autonomous AI workflows
🌐 Bright Data for enterprise-grade web scraping
🧠 Google Gemini 2.0 for advanced analysis
⚡ FastAPI with real-time streaming
🎨 React + TypeScript frontend with live updates
The Challenge
Traditional competitive intelligence faces several challenges:
Manual Data Collection: Hours spent browsing websites, collecting pricing info, and researching leadership teams
Fragmented Analysis: Data scattered across multiple sources without unified insights
Outdated Reports: By the time analysis is complete, information may already be stale
Limited Scalability: Human analysts can only research a few competitors at a time
Our Solution: Multi-Agent Architecture
We designed a three-agent workflow that mirrors how human analysts work:
┌─────────────────┐

Technical Implementation
1. Setting Up the Environment
First, let's set up our dependencies:
# requirements.txt
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn>=0.24.0
strands>=0.1.0
strands-tools>=0.1.0
litellm>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
# Environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
export BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY="your_brightdata_api_key"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Creating Specialized Agents
Each agent has a specific role and prompt optimized for its task:
from strands import Agent
from strands.models.litellm import LiteLLMModel
from strands_tools import bright_data
def get_gemini_model():
"""Configure Gemini model using LiteLLM"""
gemini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
return LiteLLMModel(
client_args={"api_key": gemini_api_key},
model_id="gemini/gemini-2.0-flash",
params={"max_tokens": 4000, "temperature": 0.3}
)
# Researcher Agent - Data Collection
RESEARCHER_PROMPT = """You are a Researcher Agent specialized in competitive intelligence data gathering.
Your role:
1. **Data Collection**: Use bright_data tool to gather comprehensive competitor information
2. **Source Discovery**: Find recent news, funding announcements, product launches
3. **Website Analysis**: Scrape pricing pages, product descriptions, company information
4. **LinkedIn Intelligence**: Get structured data about leadership and team size
Focus on recent developments, pricing strategy, leadership team, and market position.
Keep findings under 800 words and include source URLs."""
# Analyst Agent - Strategic Analysis
ANALYST_PROMPT = """You are an Analyst Agent specialized in competitive intelligence analysis.
Your role:
1. **Strategic Analysis**: Analyze competitive positioning and market strategy
2. **SWOT Assessment**: Identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats
3. **Business Model Analysis**: Understand revenue streams and value propositions
4. **Competitive Threats**: Assess level of competitive threat and market overlap
Rate competitive threat level from 1-5 and provide actionable insights.
Keep analysis under 600 words."""
# Writer Agent - Report Generation
WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a Writer Agent specialized in competitive intelligence reporting.
Structure reports with:
- Executive Summary (key findings and threat level)
- Business Model Analysis
- Competitive Positioning
- Strategic Recommendations
- Action Items
Keep reports under 700 words, professional tone, actionable for decision-makers."""

3. Multi-Agent Workflow Implementation
class MultiAgentCompetitiveIntelligence:
def __init__(self, stream_callback=None):
gemini_model = get_gemini_model()
# Create specialized agents
self.researcher_agent = Agent(
model=gemini_model,
system_prompt=RESEARCHER_PROMPT,
tools=[bright_data],
callback_handler=StreamingCallbackHandler(stream_callback)
)
self.analyst_agent = Agent(
model=gemini_model,
system_prompt=ANALYST_PROMPT,
callback_handler=StreamingCallbackHandler(stream_callback)
)
self.writer_agent = Agent(
model=gemini_model,
system_prompt=WRITER_PROMPT,
callback_handler=StreamingCallbackHandler(stream_callback)
)
def run_competitive_intelligence_workflow(self, competitor_name, competitor_website=None):
"""Execute the three-stage workflow"""
# Stage 1: Research
research_query = f"""Research competitive intelligence for "{competitor_name}".
Gather comprehensive information about:
1. Recent company news, funding, and market developments
2. Pricing strategy and product positioning
3. Company leadership and team structure
4. Market position and customer feedback
5. Financial information and growth metrics
"""
research_findings = self.researcher_agent(research_query)
# Stage 2: Analysis
analysis_query = f"""Analyze these findings for "{competitor_name}":
{research_findings}
Provide strategic analysis including:
1. SWOT assessment
2. Business model analysis
3. Competitive positioning
4. Threat level assessment (1-5)
5. Strategic insights for competitive response
"""
strategic_analysis = self.analyst_agent(analysis_query)
# Stage 3: Report Writing
report_query = f"""Create comprehensive competitive intelligence report:
RESEARCH FINDINGS: {research_findings}
STRATEGIC ANALYSIS: {strategic_analysis}
Generate professional report with executive summary,
business model analysis, and strategic recommendations.
"""
final_report = self.writer_agent(report_query)
return {
"competitor": competitor_name,
"research_findings": str(research_findings),
"strategic_analysis": str(strategic_analysis),
"final_report": str(final_report),
"status": "success"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Real-Time Streaming with FastAPI
The platform provides real-time updates during analysis:
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio
import json
@app.post("/analyze/stream")
async def analyze_competitor_stream(request: AnalysisRequest):
"""Streaming endpoint with real-time updates"""
async def generate_stream():
events_queue = asyncio.Queue()
def stream_callback(event):
"""Capture tool calls and status updates"""
asyncio.create_task(events_queue.put(event))
# Run analysis with streaming
async def run_analysis():
intelligence_system = MultiAgentCompetitiveIntelligence(stream_callback)
result = intelligence_system.run_competitive_intelligence_workflow(
competitor_name=request.competitor_name,
competitor_website=request.competitor_website
)
# Send final result
final_event = {
"timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
"type": "complete",
"data": result
}
await events_queue.put(final_event)
await events_queue.put(None)
# End signal
# Start analysis
analysis_task = asyncio.create_task(run_analysis())
# Stream events
while True:
event = await events_queue.get()
if event is None:
break
yield f"data: {json.dumps(event)}\n\n"
await analysis_task
return StreamingResponse(
generate_stream(),
media_type="text/event-stream",
headers={"Cache-Control": "no-cache"}
)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Frontend Integration with React
The React frontend provides live visualization of the analysis process:
// CompetitiveIntelligenceForm.tsx
const [analysisState, setAnalysisState] = useState<'idle' | 'running' | 'complete'>('idle');
const [streamingEvents, setStreamingEvents] = useState<StreamEvent[]>([]);
const startStreamingAnalysis = async (data: FormData) => {
setAnalysisState('running');
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/analyze/stream`, {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
body: JSON.stringify({ ...data, stream: true })
});
const reader = response.body?.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
while (true) {
const { value, done } = await reader!.read();
if (done) break;
const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
const lines = chunk.split('\n');
for (const line of lines) {
if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
const event = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
setStreamingEvents(prev => [...prev, event]);
if (event.type === 'complete') {
setAnalysisState('complete');
setAnalysisResult(event.data);
}
}
}
}
};
