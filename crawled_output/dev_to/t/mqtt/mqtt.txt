about #mqtt
MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol that transports messages between apps and devices.
It was initially created in 1999 for constrained environments. As the Internet of Things has expanded, it has gained broad usage.
MQTT is an OASIS standard, and also an ISO recommendation (ISO/IEC 20922)
You can learn more about it on the website, read about it on Wikipedia, or explore some code using the MQTT topic on GitHub.
