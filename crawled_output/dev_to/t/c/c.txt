submission guidelines
Articles and discussions should be directly related to the C programming language. (Not to be confused with C++ (#cpp), Objective C (#objectivec), or C# (#csharp).)
Questions are encouraged! (See the #help tag)
Be careful when criticizing C as a language or platform; most such complaints are old news. Criticisms are permitted, but please keep such discussions polite and objective.
about #c
C is a compiled programming language developed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (K&R) in 1972. It is an imperative procedural language based on ALGOL, and is common in systems development.
