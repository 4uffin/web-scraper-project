CLI is a text-based user interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software by typing commands into a terminal.

about #cli
Before there were graphical user interfaces, command-line interfaces were used to issue commands to a computer. Programs that handle the user interface are called command language interpreters, often known as a shell. A CLI may give a user more control over the computer and programs they wish to execute.
