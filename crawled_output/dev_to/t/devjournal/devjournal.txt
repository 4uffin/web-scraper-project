Dear Diary...
Create Post
submission guidelines
UPDATED 30 AUG 2019
Posts should be about your own journey. The focus should be on what you tried, accomplished, learned, and/or plan to do.
Some good examples:
What I learned last week
Weekly Goals
Weeknotes
10 Days as a Software Developer
What Doesn't Belong
Posts NOT directly related to your experience.
Posts primarily promoting a project. (Tell us how you did it instead!)
Questions (use #help.)
Most discussion prompts (use #discuss). Journaling prompts encouraged, however!
about #devjournal
Public journaling is a great way to share your journey with other developers!
