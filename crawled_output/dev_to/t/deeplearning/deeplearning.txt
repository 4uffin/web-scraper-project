about #deeplearning
Conventional machine learning techniques are limited in their ability to automatically transform the raw unstructured data into a suitable internal representation. Deep learning methods are representation learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing several simple but non-linear modules that each transform the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level - to put it simply - Neural Networks. With the composition of enough such transformations, very complex functions can be learned - a universal approximator.
If you want to share something primarily on deep learning techniques please use #deeplearning tag.
