Ruby is an open-source dynamic object-oriented interpreted language that combines the good bits from Perl, Smalltalk, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms including functional, object-oriented, and imperative.
Ruby was initially conceived on February 24, 1993, by Yukihiro Matsumoto ('Matz') and version 1.0 was released in 1996
