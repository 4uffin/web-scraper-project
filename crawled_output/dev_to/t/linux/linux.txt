submission guidelines
Articles and discussions should be directly related to Linux operating systems. Questions are encouraged (see the #help tag).
Content with the main focus on bash or the Unix shell is permitted, but don't forget to add the #bash or #unix tag as you see it fitting.
Articles mainly about WSL should be tagged with #wsl instead of #linux.
about #linux
