submission guidelines
Please ensure that any post that is tagged with #computerscience is related to computer science in some way. Promotional posts will be untagged, as will posts unrelated to CS.
Please also be sure that your content adheres to the DEV Code of Conduct and that your comments are constructive and kind.
about #computerscience
Did you learn about a new data structure recently? Or perhaps you tried to implement an algorithm in a new language? Or maybe you need help understanding a white paper? The #computerscience tag is a great place for any of these questions and ideas.
Please be sure to cross-tag any content that might help other folks in the DEV community. For example, an introduction to linked lists should also be tagged with the #beginners tag. Similarly, a post that asks for a simple explanation to the traveling salesman problem should be tagged with the #explainlikeimfive tag.
