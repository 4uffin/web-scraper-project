submission guidelines

Please also be sure that your content adheres to the DEV Code of Conduct and that your comments are constructive and kind.
about #computerscience
Did you learn about a new data structure recently? Or perhaps you tried to implement an algorithm in a new language? Or maybe you need help understanding a white paper? The #computerscience tag is a great place for any of these questions and ideas.
Please be sure to cross-tag any content that might help other folks in the DEV community. For example, an introduction to linked lists should also be tagged with the #beginners tag. Similarly, a post that asks for a simple explanation to the traveling salesman problem should be tagged with the #explainlikeimfive tag.
