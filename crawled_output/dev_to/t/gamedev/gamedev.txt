about #gamedev
From GameMaker Studio to Unity, RPG Maker to 6502 assembly - this is your stop for all things related to game development! However, please make sure that your post is about DEVELOPING A GAME, or TOOLS THAT DEVELOPERS CAN USE, but please make sure they are tools MADE for developers, not just tools like twitter. That can go in topics like #socialmedia.
