submission guidelines
For showing off projects and launching products.
Please make posts community-driven and not overly corporate or salesy.
Typically it is for showing off your thing or your company's thing. You can however, show off someone else's thing, but just make it clear it's theirs and not yours.
Don't just use this tag to share posts or tutorials your proud of â€” this is really for projects.
