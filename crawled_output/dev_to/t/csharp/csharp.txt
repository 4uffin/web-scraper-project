submission guidelines
Articles and discussions should be directly related to the C# programming language. (Not to be confused with C (#c), C++ (#cpp), or Objective C (#objectivec))
Questions are encouraged! (See the #help tag)
Be careful when criticizing C# as a language or platform; most such complaints are old news. Criticisms are permitted, but please keep such discussions polite and objective.
about #csharp
C# is a compiled programming language developed by Microsoft in 2000, as part of their .NET platform. It offers features of imperative, declarative, object-oriented, functional, and component-oriented programming.
Although based on C++, C# is a distinct language with its own unique design and specification.
The current stable release is C# 7.3.
