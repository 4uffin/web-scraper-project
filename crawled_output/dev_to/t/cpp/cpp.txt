submission guidelines
Articles and discussions should be directly related to the C++ programming language. (Not to be confused with C (#c), Objective C (#objectivec), or C# (#csharp))
Questions are encouraged! (See the #help tag)
Be careful when criticizing C++ as a language or platform; most such complaints are old news. Criticisms are permitted, but please keep such discussions polite and objective.
about #cpp
C++ is a compiled programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. It offers features of imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming.
The current language standard is C++20.
