about #fastapi
FastAPI is a blazingly fast ⚡ python framework for building APIs based on Python-type hints in no time.
😲 Facts
⚡ FastAPI is built on top of Starlette, a Python Framework, which means it inherits all of Starlette's great features like asynchronous request handling and middleware support.
✅ It can be used with Pydantic for data validation and serialization, which makes it incredibly easy to validate and convert incoming request data into the format you need.
👩‍💻 One of the best things about the framework is how quickly you can get up and running with it. Thanks to its easy-to-use routing system and automatic OpenAPI validation and documentation, you can have a fully functioning API up and running in no time at all.
🔐 It comes with built-in support for various authentication schemes such as OAuth2 and JWT. This makes it easy to secure your API endpoints and ensure only authorized users have access to them.
💡 It is fully compatible with Python 3.7+ so you can take advantage of all the latest Python features when building your API.
📈 Despite not even having released version 1.0 yet, it has already gained a large following among developers who are excited about what this framework can offer them in terms of speed, scalability, and security.
