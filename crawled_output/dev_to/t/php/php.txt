submission guidelines
Let's please follow some simple, sensible guidelines:
âœ” Posts should be directly related to the official PHP language, not FaceBook's Hack or some other dialect.
âœ” If you need very specific help (deploying Laravel on shared hosting, using mcrypt_decrypt, etc., Dev.to might not be the best platform)
âœ” Yes, PHP is an old tech with several flaws, but reiterating them doesn't help anyone.
âœ” Don't post a video/image or your projects without a proper introduction.
âœ” Always include relevant code snippets.
âœ” Arguing is encouraged; being an asshole is not!
about #php
Created in 1994, PHP is the lingua franca for Web development. While it gets bashed a lot for bad design, the PHP 7 series has added everything a modern dev can ask for.
Unless your needs are very specific and specialized, PHP is always a great choice for starting a new project!
