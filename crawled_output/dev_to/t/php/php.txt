submission guidelines
Let's please follow some simple, sensible guidelines:
✔ Posts should be directly related to the official PHP language, not FaceBook's Hack or some other dialect.
✔ If you need very specific help (deploying Laravel on shared hosting, using mcrypt_decrypt, etc., Dev.to might not be the best platform)
✔ Yes, PHP is an old tech with several flaws, but reiterating them doesn't help anyone.
✔ Don't post a video/image or your projects without a proper introduction.
✔ Always include relevant code snippets.
✔ Arguing is encouraged; being an asshole is not!
about #php
Created in 1994, PHP is the lingua franca for Web development. While it gets bashed a lot for bad design, the PHP 7 series has added everything a modern dev can ask for.
Unless your needs are very specific and specialized, PHP is always a great choice for starting a new project!
