DeepFabric is a Game Changer: 🚀 Build ⛓️-of-💭 Reasoning Datasets in Minutes Using Natural Prompts 💬

Stop Spending Weeks on Dataset Creation. Start Training Better Models Today.
As developers, we've all been there. You have a brilliant idea for a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, but then reality hits: you need training data. Quality training data. A lot of quality training data.
The traditional path? Weeks of manual data curation, complex prompt engineering, or expensive data labeling. Most of us end up abandoning the project or settling for subpar datasets that produce mediocre models.
What if I told you there's a tool that can generate professional-grade CoT datasets in minutes using natural language prompts?
Enter DeepFabric - and it's about to change how you think about dataset creation forever.
The Problem: Dataset Creation is Broken
Before DeepFabric, creating CoT datasets meant:
📝 Manual curation: Spending days writing examples by hand
🔧 Complex prompt engineering: Wrestling with intricate templates
💸 Expensive services: Paying premium rates for quality data
🎯 Limited diversity: Struggling to create varied, non-repetitive examples
⚖️ Quality vs. quantity: Choosing between good data or enough data
Most developers either gave up or shipped models trained on insufficient data.
The Solution: DeepFabric's Triple Threat
DeepFabric doesn't just solve the dataset problem - it obliterates it with three different CoT formats that cover every use case:
1. 🔥 Free-text CoT (GSM8K Style)
Perfect for mathematical reasoning and step-by-step problem solving.
deepfabric generate \
--mode tree \
--provider openai \
--model gpt-4o-mini \
--depth 2 \
--degree 2 \
--num-steps 4 \
--topic-prompt "Mathematical word problems and logical reasoning" \
--generation-system-prompt "You are a math tutor creating educational problems" \
--conversation-type cot_freetext \
--dataset-save-as math_reasoning.jsonl
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output format:
{
"question": "Sarah has 24 apples. She gives away 1/3 to her neighbors and keeps 1/4 for herself. How many apples are left?",
"chain_of_thought": "First, I need to find 1/3 of 24 apples. 24 ÷ 3 = 8 apples given to neighbors. Next, I need to find 1/4 of 24 apples. 24 ÷ 4 = 6 apples kept for herself. Total apples used: 8 + 6 = 14 apples. Apples left: 24 - 14 = 10 apples.",
"final_answer": "10 apples"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. 🏗️ Structured CoT (Conversation Based)
Ideal for educational dialogues and systematic problem-solving.
deepfabric generate \
--mode graph \
--provider ollama \
--model qwen3:32b \
--topic-prompt "Computer science algorithms and data structures" \
--conversation-type cot_structured \
--reasoning-style logical \
--dataset-save-as cs_reasoning.jsonl
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output format:
{
"messages": [
{"role": "user", "content": "How would you implement a binary search algorithm?"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I'll walk you through implementing binary search step by step..."}
],
"reasoning_trace": [
{"step": 1, "reasoning": "Define the search space with left and right pointers"},
{"step": 2, "reasoning": "Calculate middle index to divide the array"},
{"step": 3, "reasoning": "Compare target with middle element"}
],
"final_answer": "Here's the complete binary search implementation..."
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. 🚀 Hybrid CoT (Best of Both Worlds)
Combines natural reasoning with structured steps - perfect for complex domains.
deepfabric generate \
--provider gemini \
--model gemini-2.5-flash \
--topic-prompt "Scientific reasoning and physics problems" \
--conversation-type cot_hybrid \
--num-steps 8 \
--dataset-save-as science_hybrid.jsonl
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output format:
{
"question": "A ball is thrown upward with initial velocity 20 m/s. When will it hit the ground?",
"chain_of_thought": "This is a projectile motion problem. I need to use kinematic equations...",
"reasoning_trace": [
{"concept": "Initial conditions", "value": "v₀ = 20 m/s, y₀ = 0"},
{"concept": "Kinematic equation", "value": "y = v₀t - ½gt²"},
{"concept": "Ground impact", "value": "y = 0, solve for t"}
],
"final_answer": "The ball hits the ground after 4.08 seconds"
}

Why Developers Are Going Crazy for DeepFabric
⚡ Speed That Will Blow Your Mind
# Generate 100 CoT examples in under 5 minutes
deepfabric generate config.yaml --num-steps 100 --batch-size 10
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🧠 Smart Topic Generation
DeepFabric doesn't just generate random examples. It creates a hierarchical topic tree first, ensuring your dataset covers diverse subtopics without redundancy:
Mathematical Reasoning
├── Algebra Problems
│
├── Linear Equations
│
└── Quadratic Functions
└── Geometry Problems
├── Area Calculations
└── Volume Problems
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🔧 YAML Configuration = Zero Complexity
No more complex prompt engineering. Just describe what you want:
# cot_config.yaml
dataset_system_prompt: "You are a helpful AI that solves problems step-by-step"
topic_tree:
topic_prompt: "Programming challenges and algorithms"
provider: "ollama"
model: "qwen3:32b"
depth: 3
degree: 3
data_engine:
conversation_type: "cot_hybrid"
reasoning_style: "logical"
instructions: "Create coding problems that require systematic thinking"
dataset:
creation:
num_steps: 50
batch_size: 5
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then run: deepfabric generate cot_config.yaml
🌐 Multi-Provider Freedom
Switch between providers based on your needs:
OpenAI GPT-4 for complex reasoning
Ollama for local, private generation
Gemini for fast bulk creation
Anthropic Claude for nuanced problems
📤 Instant HuggingFace Integration
deepfabric generate config.yaml --hf-repo username/my-cot-dataset
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Your dataset is automatically uploaded with a generated dataset card. No manual uploads, no fuss.
