I Built a FULL-STACK Challenge Tracker with AI
#devchallenge
#kendoreactchallenge
#react
#webdev
This is a submission for the KendoReact Free Components Challenge.
What I Built
Dev Challenge Tracker is a local-first, one-tab HQ for shipping stellar DEV challenge submissions. Plan challenges, capture tasks and ideas, store research links, and draft publish-ready Markdown—all without leaving the browser or giving up control of your data. The workspace leans on an AI copiloting loop: a KendoReact Chat-driven assistant orchestrates planning steps, executes functions (e.g., structured drafting, tool calls, Nuclia enrichment), and reflects on results so you keep momentum while the agent handles the tedious parts.
Why it hits the brief:
Build without boundaries – paste a challenge link and the app shapes it into a living brief with Markdown everywhere.
Local-first by design – everything stays in the browser; no sign-ups, no sync service, no hidden database.
AI when you want it – drop in a single OpenRouter key to unlock an AI copilot that understands your plan and returns Markdown replies.
Agentic workflow – the assistant plans next steps, triggers function executors, and syncs research via Nuclia so progress compounds automatically.
One workspace, multiple submissions – optimized to help creators juggle several DEV challenges in parallel without losing momentum.
UX touches we obsessed over:
Single AppBar with contextual actions and Nuclia search toggle.
Rounded “panel” cards for Challenges, Ideas, Resources, and Tasks.
Dialog flows built with KendoReact inputs for consistent spacing and accessibility.
AI chat bubble with Markdown rendering, typing indicator, and responsive sizing.

KendoReact Components Used (Free Tier)

Code Smarter, Not Harder Prize Entry
We used the KendoReact MCP server (“kendo-react-assistant”) as our AI coding assistant:
Pulled component-specific tips straight from Telerik’s proprietary knowledge base.
Generated Dialog + DropDownList scaffolding when iterating on the challenge workflow UI.
Resolved edge cases (Chat message typing indicator, DropDownList events) without leaving the IDE.
Setup: registered the MCP server in mcp.json, authenticated with our Telerik license, and invoked it via the #kendo-react-assistant tag in terminal sessions.
RAGs to Riches Prize Entry
We wired Nuclia straight into the workspace so research and retrieval stay in the same tab:
Live Nuclia search in the AppBar. The shared AppBar renders the Nuclia web component (loaded via nuclia-widget.umd.js) and positions a custom results overlay when the field gains focus. Creators can type any question and get Nuclia answers, rephrases, and suggestions without leaving the dashboard.
Self-serve RAG settings. A gear icon opens the “RAG Settings” dialog where users paste their API key, knowledge box, zone, and host overrides. We persist everything to localStorage so power users can point the tool at their own Nuclia tenants.
Resource ingestion pipeline. When a new Resource is saved, we convert the metadata to Markdown (mdResource) and POST it through a Next.js /api/nuclia/upload proxy. That proxy resolves zone-aware endpoints and pushes the document into the configured knowledge box—ready to be recalled by the search widget moments later.
Extensible hooks. Helper utilities (mdChallenge, mdTask, mdIdea) map other entities to Markdown so we can graduate more of the workspace into Nuclia-powered recall as the library grows.
That end-to-end loop makes Nuclia more than a checkbox: it actively fuels ideation, keeps notes searchable, and lets teammates reuse hard-earned research while they chase the next DEV challenge.
Architecture & Experience Highlights
Local storage persistence with a dedicated Tracker context for Challenges, Tasks, Resources, and Ideas.
Dialog-driven CRUD flows wired to Nuclia helpers for future AI knowledge base sync.
Markdown rendering everywhere (including AI replies) for copy-paste-ready DEV posts.
AI agent pipeline (Chat + functionExecutor + Nuclia ingestion) loops through plan → act → learn cycles without leaving the UI.
Responsive AppBar with Nuclia search slot, settings gear, and quick-action ButtonGroup.
AI chat bubble sized to available viewport with custom message template and “processing” state.
Why It Matters
DEV challenges move fast. Dev Challenge Tracker gives creators a single place to brainstorm, plan, execute, and polish—without waiting on backend infrastructure or losing track of progress. The KendoReact free suite handled the UI heavy lifting so we could focus on flow, accessibility, and delight.

Great work!
The chat screen is cutting off with the regular zoom of 100%
The Agentic RAG doesn't seem to be working. Getting a console error.

I just saw in console logs - the Nuclia is not set up.
click on gear icon and it will show you what you need.
Since this is local first, no database, server is set. This is not the SAAS project :)
Bring your own keys :))

Please do not expect the users to know all these. However, the system should be designed with the effective UI/UX guidelines and best practices.
Do not assume the users of your system to be an expert :)

that's why there is a video to help with set up and Readme on github :)
anyone who is participating in challenges would know what's up.
the project is open source. you can fire PR of what you think we can improve :)

For the chat window on smaller screens - fixing it.
for the Agentic RAG system you need your own Nuclia API keys. you can set it up here nuclia.com/
Did you set it up and it still doesn't work?

Thanks so much!
I'm glad you're enjoying the UI! ❤️
It's Geist Sans as the main font and Geist Mono for code elements - both from Google Fonts.

This is such a polished submission . Love how you combined local-first design, AI copiloting, and Nuclia RAG into a single seamless flow—it feels like a real productivity boost rather than just a demo. The attention to UX (AppBar actions, dialog-driven CRUD, Markdown everywhere) shows you built this for actual daily use, not just to tick the challenge boxes. Curious: which part was the trickiest to implement—the AI chat + function execution loop, or wiring Nuclia ingestion into the resource pipeline?
