AI Infrastructure Cloud Setup: Practical Choices That Scale
#ai

Designing and deploying AI infrastructure in the cloud is no longer a niche challenge. Developers, startups, and enterprises all face the same questions: which cloud, which GPUs, and how do you keep it reliable without burning budget?
This guide breaks down what a modern AI infrastructure stack needs, compares cloud options, and outlines reference architectures that scale.
What does good AI infrastructure look like?
A robust setup should cover:
Compute: managed foundation models or self-hosted open models
Networking: private connectivity and strong IAM controls
Inference: servers that autoscale under load
Observability: track latency, tokens, and cost per request
Data layer: secure storage and vector databases with governance
MLOps: CI/CD for models, rollback paths, and experiment tracking
Hyperscalers vs GPU-specialist clouds
Hyperscalers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
Pros:
Tight integration with identity, networking, and compliance
Managed model catalogs and private access endpoints
Built-in safety and governance features
Good fit if you need enterprise governance and don‚Äôt want to manage runtimes.
Specialist GPU Clouds (RunPod, CoreWeave, Lambda)
Pros:
Lower GPU cost per hour
Direct control over kernels, libraries, and serving stack
Bring your own container with vLLM, Triton, or custom stack
Good fit if you want control, flexibility, and cost efficiency.
Also See: Deploying Hugging Face LLMs on RunPod
The GPU cost reality check
Capex model: H100 cards and DGX servers are prohibitively expensive for most teams.
Cloud model: On-demand GPU pricing is more accessible, especially with spot or burst capacity.
Mix model: Combine reserved capacity for steady workloads with on-demand pools for bursts.
Always measure in $/token instead of GPU hours. Track tokens in/out and optimize per workload.
Reference Architectures
1. Managed-model, private access
Hyperscaler models served in your VPC
Autoscaling handled by the provider
Safety and governance included
Why: fastest time-to-value with enterprise networking.
2. Self-hosted open models
RunPod or similar GPU cloud
Inference stack with vLLM or Triton
Private endpoints and VPN back to your network
Your own observability with Prometheus/OpenTelemetry
Why: maximum flexibility and performance tuning.
3. Hybrid approach
Control plane in a hyperscaler
Data plane across hyperscaler endpoints and GPU specialist clusters
Policy-based routing to pick best cost/performance option
Why: keeps optionality as models, prices, and features evolve.
Decision Framework
Workload shape: latency-critical chat vs batch summarization
Data sensitivity: regulated workloads ‚Üí private endpoints, customer-managed keys
Model strategy: managed models vs open weights for portability
Cost posture: opex-only (on-demand) vs steady scale (reserved + mix)
Building Blocks
Serving: vLLM, Triton, TensorRT-LLM
Retrieval: vector DB + cache hot embeddings
Pipelines: queues for batch, orchestrators for agents
Networking: VPC peering, segmentation
Safety: PII filters, jailbreak detection, content guardrails
Recommended by maturity
Pilot
Use managed models with private endpoints
Minimal code, built-in safety
Production v1
Add a dedicated inference cluster on GPU cloud
Secure data with private networking and encryption
Scale-out
Policy-based routing across multiple providers
Mix reserved and on-demand GPU pools
Continuous evaluation of new models
Key Takeaways
Start with managed models if you need speed and compliance.
Use GPU-specialist clouds if you need cost control and flexibility.
Keep a hybrid option ready to hedge against rapid vendor and model shifts.
At Scalevise, we help companies design and implement cloud AI infrastructures that scale without waste. From IAM and VPC design to GPU orchestration and observability dashboards, we blueprint the entire path to production.

Why even bother with RunPod or CoreWeave when AWS gives you everything in one place?

If you‚Äôre fine with hyperscaler pricing and lock-in, then sure, AWS covers it all. But once workloads scale, specialist GPU clouds can cut costs by 30‚Äì50%. For teams with budget pressure, that difference matters.

On-prem is still the only sane option for regulated industries. Clouds change APIs every year.

On-prem makes sense for some, but it‚Äôs not always realistic. Hardware refresh, cooling, and ops staff add up fast. For many, a private cloud setup with strict networking and customer-managed keys achieves compliance without owning racks.

I get that, but regulators don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúcustomer-managed keys‚Äù if the infrastructure is still outside your control. Once auditors step in, they‚Äôll push for physical data residency. How do you convince them a GPU cloud is compliant?

That‚Äôs exactly where governance comes in. You need documented controls: where data is stored, how it‚Äôs encrypted, who has access, and how logs prove that. In practice, we‚Äôve seen regulators accept GPU cloud setups if workloads run in-region, data never leaves the VPC, and compliance frameworks (ISO, SOC, GDPR) are mapped. It‚Äôs not trivial, but it‚Äôs possible with the right architecture.

Our team started with managed models on Vertex AI, then moved some heavy batch jobs to a GPU cloud. The hybrid approach really does make sense once traffic grows.

That‚Äôs the sweet spot: start managed, then offload heavy jobs where it‚Äôs cheaper. Keeps both compliance and cost under control.

We tested L40S for background jobs and it was perfect. Way cheaper than H100s for workloads that don‚Äôt need low latency.

Exactly!! not every task needs the top GPU. Mixing tiers is one of the simplest ways to save costs without hurting performance where it matters.
