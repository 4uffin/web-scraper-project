Event Bubbling vs Event Capturing in JavaScript
#programming
#webdev
#javascript
When you click on an element inside nested elements, the event doesn’t just happen on that element — it travels through the DOM. There are two ways this can happen: capturing and bubbling.
1. Event Capturing (trickle down)
The event starts at the top (document) and goes down through each parent until it reaches the target.
Analogy: a grandparent tells a message → parent → child.
2. Event Bubbling (bubble up)
The event starts at the target element and then goes up through the parents until the root (document).
Analogy: bubbles rise from the bottom of a glass to the top.
3. Default in JavaScript
By default, JavaScript uses bubbling.
To use capturing, pass true as the third parameter in addEventListener.
// Bubbling (default)
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
console.log("Button clicked!");
});
// Capturing
div.addEventListener(
"click",
() => {
console.log("DIV clicked during capturing!");
},
true // 👈 capturing enabled
);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Event Flow Order
When you click the button:
Capturing phase: document → body → div → button
Target phase: the button itself
Bubbling phase: button → div → body → document
5. Why does this matter?
Capturing: less common, useful if you want to intercept early.
Bubbling: very common, great for event delegation (attach one listener to a parent instead of every child).
🧠 Quick Mental Model
Capturing = trickle down (parent → child)
Bubbling = bubble up (child → parent)
⚡ That’s it! Now you know how events travel in JavaScript.
