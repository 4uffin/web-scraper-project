React useRef vs useState — When to Use Which
#react
#useref
#hooks
#usestate
React gives us useState and useRef to store values across renders. But they behave differently.
1. useState
Stores data that affects rendering.
When state changes → component re-renders.
Best for values you want to show in the UI.
function Counter() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0) // 🔄 triggers re-render
return (
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
Count: {count}
</button>
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Every click updates count → React re-renders → UI shows new value.
2. useRef
Stores a mutable value that survives re-renders.
Updating .current does NOT trigger re-render.
Best for storing DOM nodes or values that don’t affect UI.
function Timer() {
const intervalRef = useRef<number | null>(null) // 🗃️ stable across renders
function start() {
intervalRef.current = window.setInterval(() => {
console.log("tick")
}, 1000)
}
function stop() {
if (intervalRef.current) clearInterval(intervalRef.current)
}
return (
<>
<button onClick={start}>Start</button>
<button onClick={stop}>Stop</button>
</>
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Here, intervalRef keeps the timer ID but doesn’t cause re-renders.
3. When to Use Which?
✅ Use useState when…
The value affects rendering.
UI should update when value changes.
Examples: counters, form fields, theme toggles, fetched data.
✅ Use useRef when…
The value should persist across renders but doesn’t affect UI.
You want to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Examples:
Accessing DOM elements (ref={myRef})
Storing timer IDs, WebSocket connections
Holding previous values for comparison
4. Example: Using Both Together
function InputFocus() {
const [text, setText] = useState("")
// shows in UI
const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null) // reference to DOM
return (
<>
<input ref={inputRef} value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
<button onClick={() => inputRef.current?.focus()}>
Focus input
</button>
</>
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
useState stores the text (triggers render).
useRef stores a DOM reference (no render needed).
5. Quick Mental Model 🧠
useState = for UI → change → re-render.
useRef = for storage → change → no re-render.
6. Cheatsheet Table
Feature
useState ✅
useRef ✅
Triggers re-render on change
✔️ Yes
❌ No
Best for
UI values (text, count, toggles)
DOM refs, timers, storage
Persists across renders
✔️ Yes
✔️ Yes
Mutable without causing render
❌ No
✔️ Yes
Common uses
Form inputs, counters, fetched data
Focus input, store IDs, previous values, WebSocket refs
⚡ That’s it! Now you know when to reach for useState and when to grab useRef — and have a cheatsheet for quick reference.
