How To Suppress Build Errors in Next.js with TypeScript
#nextjs
#typescript
#webdev
#programming
In the fast-paced world of web development, minimizing roadblocks during prototyping or initial integration can be useful. Suppressing build errors is one way to keep your pipeline moving, especially when integrating large third-party libraries. Hereâ€™s how itâ€™s commonly done in a Next.js project with TypeScriptâ€”and why you need to be careful.
Suppressing TypeScript Build Errors in next.config.ts or next.config.mjs
Next.js provides a straightforward way to ignore TypeScript build errors by updating the next.config.ts/next.config.mjs file:
// next.config.ts/mjs
export default {
typescript: {
ignoreBuildErrors: true,
},
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Setting ignoreBuildErrors to true tells Next.js to proceed with the build even if TypeScript finds type errors.
Disabling Strict Type Checking in tsconfig.json
Another approach is to loosen TypeScriptâ€™s strictness in your tsconfig.json:
{
"compilerOptions": {
"strict": false
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Turning off "strict" disables a suite of advanced type-checking features, which can make builds pass more easily but also reduces the safety and reliability of your codebase.
When and Why You Might Do This
Rapid prototyping: When integrating complex packages or fast-tracking proof-of-concept work.
3rd-party code: Some external libraries might introduce type errors you canâ€™t immediately address.
Legacy code: Migrating older codebases where fixing all type errors upfront is impractical.
Best Practices and Warnings
Temporary measure: Only suppress errors short-term. Plan to re-enable strict checking before major releases.
Track suppressed errors: Maintain a list of known issues to avoid introducing new bugs.
Code review required: All uses of suppressed errors should be reviewed, and a plan for resolution should be in place.
Conclusion
Suppressing errors can unblock your workflow, but always treat it as a temporary solution. Ultimately, type errors exist to prevent runtime bugsâ€”ignoring them for too long can lead to greater technical debt.
