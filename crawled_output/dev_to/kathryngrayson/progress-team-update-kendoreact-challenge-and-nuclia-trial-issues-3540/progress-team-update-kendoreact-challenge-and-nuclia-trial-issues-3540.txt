Progress Team Update: KendoReact Challenge and Nuclia Trial Issues

Hey folks! We've gotten some feedback about issues related to the Nuclia trials for the Dev Challenge. First off, I want to apologize â€“ we thought we had adjustments to the trial process cleared and ready in advance of the hackathon, but turns out...not so much. ðŸ™ƒ Totally a mistake on our end, and we're sorry for the inconvenience and confusion.
That being said, we do have some workarounds ready so you can still participate in the "RAGs to Riches" category!
Some folks have mentioned being unable to start a Nuclia free trial without a corporate email. To fix this, please reach out to me at nanz @ progress.com (or on the Progress Labs Discord) with the email you'd like to use, and I'll manually override the block and start your trial account with whatever email you'd prefer.
There's been some concern about the 14-day free trial timing out before the judging period. There are two ways to solve this: either reach out to me (over email or Discord, as above) and I can manually extend your trial OR just take a short video of your app and include it in the submission template.
Thanks so much, and again â€“ very sorry for any trouble! We're super excited to see what you build, and here to help support however you need.
