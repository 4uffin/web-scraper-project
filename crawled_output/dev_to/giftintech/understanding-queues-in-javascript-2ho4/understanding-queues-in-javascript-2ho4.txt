Understanding Queues in JavaScript
#javascript

#beginners
Hey friends 👋
Even though I’m a little late this week 😢, let’s keep our DSA series alive!🚀 Like I indicated last week, today we're learning about Queues, a very common and beginner-friendly data structure.
A queue works just like a line at the bus stop 🚌:
Enqueue → add a person to the back of the line
Dequeue → let the person at the front leave
Peek → check who’s at the front without removing them
This is called FIFO (First In, First Out).
Building a Simple Queue in JavaScript
class Queue {
constructor() {
this.items = [];
}
enqueue(element) {
this.items.push(element);
}
dequeue() {
return this.items.shift();
}
peek() {
return this.items[0];
}
isEmpty() {
return this.items.length === 0;
}
size() {
return this.items.length;
}
}
// Example usage:
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue("Alice");
queue.enqueue("Bob");
console.log(queue.peek()); // Alice
queue.dequeue();
console.log(queue.peek()); // Bob
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode

🙋🏽‍♀️ Over to You!
Try expanding this queue:
Add a Clear Queue button.
Show the size of the queue.
Animate items sliding when they’re added or removed.
Let me know if you do the challenge! I'd like to see yours! Connect with me on GitHub

Your dequeue api uses the shift method which I believe is O(n). A better implementation would be to keep 2 items stacks called left and right with their top pointers tracking the enqueue and dequeue operations making them O(1). The data structure is basically 2 stacks stitched together at their ends (the middle).
The operations will run smoothly only edge cases need to be taken care off

If I wanted to avoid the array shift, I'd use a map with 2 counters. That also tracks how much has gone through your queue, which might be interesting for debugging or statistics.
But for most cases push/shift should be fine.
class Queue {
#map = new Map();
#next = 0;
#last = -1;
enqueue(element) {
this.#map.set(++this.#last, element);
}
dequeue() {
const element = this.peek();
if (element) {
this.#map.delete(this.#next++);
return element;
}
}
peek() {
return this.#map.get(this.#next);
}
size() {
return this.#map.size;
}
}

This is really efficient for large datasets. Using next and last as pointers and the Map() data structure is on point. I was trying to make the tutorial as beginner-friendly as possible, and even I might not be able to code it like this without help. Thank you!

True, I was trying to make the code seem intuitive to beginners.
My attempt to make the dequeue() 0(1):
class QueueWithStacks {
constructor() {
this.inStack = [];
this.outStack = [];
}
enqueue(element) {
this.inStack.push(element); // O(1)
}
dequeue() {
if (this.outStack.length === 0) {
// Transfer elements from inStack to outStack
while (this.inStack.length > 0) {
this.outStack.push(this.inStack.pop());
}
}
return this.outStack.pop(); // O(1)
}
peek() {
if (this.outStack.length === 0) {
while (this.inStack.length > 0) {
this.outStack.push(this.inStack.pop());
}
}
return this.outStack[this.outStack.length - 1];
}
isEmpty() {
return this.inStack.length === 0 && this.outStack.length === 0;
}
size() {
return this.inStack.length + this.outStack.length;
}
}
