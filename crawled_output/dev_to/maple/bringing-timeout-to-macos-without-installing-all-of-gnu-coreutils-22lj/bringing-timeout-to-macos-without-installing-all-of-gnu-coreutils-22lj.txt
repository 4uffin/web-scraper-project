Bringing timeout to macOS Without Installing All of GNU Coreutils
#homebrew
#cli
#linux
#bash
Not long ago, I was writing a shell script on macOS and ran into a small but surprising issue: there was no built-in timeout command. If youâ€™ve spent time on Linux, youâ€™ve probably taken timeout for granted, itâ€™s part of GNU coreutils and is incredibly handy when you want to limit how long a command can run.
On macOS, though, the situation is different. macOS ships with a BSD-flavored set of core utilities, and GNUâ€™s version of timeout simply isnâ€™t there. My first instinct was to install GNU coreutils through Homebrew:
brew install coreutils
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This does workâ€”but it comes with a catch. To avoid conflicts with the BSD commands that ship with macOS (like ls and cat), Homebrew installs GNU coreutils under names prefixed with a g. So instead of ls, you get gls; instead of timeout, you get gtimeout.
Thatâ€™s fine if youâ€™re working in a personal environment, but it creates headaches for writing portable shell scripts. If I write a script that calls gtimeout on macOS, it wonâ€™t run out-of-the-box on Linux, where the command is just timeout. Homebrew does provide a way to remove the g prefix, but thatâ€™s a pretty heavy-handed solutionâ€”suddenly your systemâ€™s default ls, cat, and other tools are replaced by GNU versions, which can break expectations in subtle ways.
So, instead of going down that path, I decided to build a standalone timeout command that behaves like GNUâ€™s version but doesnâ€™t bring along the entire coreutils package. This way, you can install just what you need without worrying about side effects.
The project is open source and lives here:
ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/aisk/timeout
And to make installation easier, I also set up a Homebrew tap. You can install it directly with:
brew install aisk/homebrew-tap/timeout
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Thatâ€™s itâ€”youâ€™ll get a drop-in replacement for timeout, without the g prefix, and without swapping out your other system tools.
I built this mainly to solve my own problem, but if it helps you too, Iâ€™d really appreciate a star on the GitHub repo. Every bit of support means a lot and helps me keep the project alive.
