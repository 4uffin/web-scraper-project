Vibe Coding vs. Professional Coding: A Developer‚Äôs Honest Take
#programming
#ai
#vibecoding
#productivity
As a full stack developer currently exploring AI/ML, I‚Äôve been building projects in a traditional way: choosing the tech stack, writing code, and solving problems step by step.
Recently, I came across the term Vibe Coding, and it instantly caught my attention. It felt very different from how I usually work, but I was curious. So, I gave it a try.
What follows is my experience doing both vibe coding and professional coding, what I learned from each, and where I think they stand in today‚Äôs world of development.
üí° What is Vibe Coding?
Vibe Coding is when someone builds a project using only AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude without needing deep coding skills.
You give the idea, and the AI does the rest: picks the tech stack, writes code, creates folder structures, and even helps with deployment. You‚Äôre mainly guiding the AI with prompts.
Vibe coders don‚Äôt write code - they guide it.
üßë‚Äçüíª What is Professional Coding?
Professional Coding is the traditional way of building software using your own skills: choosing tools, writing and debugging code, and understanding how everything works.
You control every part of the process, from idea to deployment, with a clear focus on performance, security, and maintainability.
Professional coders don‚Äôt copy solutions they build understanding.
My Experience Doing Vibe Coding Projects
After hearing the term Vibe Coding, I couldn‚Äôt ignore it. The idea of building entire projects without manually writing code felt wild, but I was curious. As a developer, I‚Äôve always believed in understanding what I build. Still, I wanted to test this hands-on.
So, I built two complete projects using only ChatGPT.
Here‚Äôs the rule I gave myself:
‚ÄúI will only share the idea or problem statement. Everything else from tech stack to deployment should come from the LLM. No using my own developer knowledge, no second-guessing. Just follow instructions like a non-coder would.‚Äù
üí° The Process
I gave ChatGPT the problem I wanted to solve. Then it started spitting out everything:
A list of project name suggestions
A complete folder structure
Fully-written UI code for the entire front end
Step-by-step backend logic
Setup for database connection
Final deployment instructions
And surprisingly, it worked. I followed the steps, copy-pasted the code, made minor edits, and got both projects live. It felt productive. I didn‚Äôt have to think hard. It was fast.
But then, I noticed something‚Ä¶
ü§Ø What I Really Learned
This section is your goldmine, so let‚Äôs break it down with clarity and impact.
1. üîß Customization is the First Wall
As a full stack dev, I‚Äôm used to tweaking layouts, styles, and components effortlessly. But with LLM-generated code, customization becomes a chore.
Want to slightly change button styles? Need a complex layout shift? You have to re-explain the whole thing to ChatGPT with perfect clarity. That means more prompting, more trial-and-error, and slower iterations.
LLMs give you a generic solution not your solution.
2. üîê Security is a Mirage
One of the biggest issues I noticed was in authentication and security. LLMs gave me working login/signup flows ‚Äî but they were shallow.
Things like:
No proper token expiration
No brute force protection
Poor validation logic
Weak password handling
If I had shipped that code to a real client, it could‚Äôve been exploited in minutes.
LLMs might give you working code, but not secure code. You still need to think like a dev.
3. üß† No Learning = No Growth
Even though I built two projects, I didn‚Äôt learn anything new. Why? Because I didn‚Äôt think through problems, didn‚Äôt explore tradeoffs, didn‚Äôt get stuck and debug my way out.
Vibe coding is execution without education.
100 vibe-coded projects ‚â† 1 deeply coded, hands-on project.
4. üêû Debugging is a Nightmare Without Understanding
The AI-generated code ran, but in some cases the output was wrong and no errors showed up. That‚Äôs the scariest type of bug: when it looks like it‚Äôs working but it‚Äôs not.
Without a real understanding of how the code works underneath, fixing this was pure guessing.
If you can‚Äôt debug it, you don‚Äôt really own it.
Vibe Coding vs Professional Coding - Pros & Cons
After trying both styles
AI-powered vibe coding and hands-on professional coding
I‚Äôve seen both the power and pitfalls of each. Let‚Äôs break it down.
ü§ñ Vibe Coding: Pros & Cons
‚úÖ Pros of Vibe Coding
Rapid Development
You can go from idea to deployment insanely fast. If you can describe what you want well, LLMs can generate an entire working solution in minutes.
Example: I built a landing page with authentication, hosted on Netlify
all within 30 minutes using just ChatGPT.
Low Barrier to Entry
You don‚Äôt need a CS degree. High school students or non-tech folks can build apps if they learn how to communicate with the AI effectively.
The real skill here is ‚ÄúPrompt Engineering.‚Äù If you can think clearly and give instructions, you can build.
Stress-Free Coding
No dealing with tricky syntax, confusing errors, or mental overload. You let the AI handle the heavy lifting, and you just implement.
It feels like autopilot you stay in the flow without friction.
‚ùå Cons of Vibe Coding
Customization is Frustrating
You hit a wall quickly when you want something highly specific. AI can‚Äôt feel your design intentions or exact user flow.
I spent 30 minutes tweaking a layout ChatGPT wrote in 30 seconds.
Security is Weak
Most AI-generated code skips over edge cases, validations, and proper auth flows.
LLMs often forget things like token expiry, rate limiting, or password hashing best practices.
Zero Conceptual Understanding
You follow the recipe but don‚Äôt learn why the ingredients matter. You become reliant on the LLM instead of growing.
After 100 projects, you might still not know how an API works under the hood.
Debugging is Hard Without Context
If the output is broken or logic is wrong, and you don‚Äôt know how the code works, fixing it becomes trial and error.
In one of my Gen AI projects, I used an LLM chat model that suddenly stopped responding no error messages, no logs. It took me over an hour to even figure out where the issue was.
üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Coding: Pros & Cons
‚úÖ Pros of Professional Coding
Full Control Over the Stack
You understand how everything connects: frontend, backend, APIs, databases. You can adjust anything at any time.
You don‚Äôt need to prompt anyone you architect the solution yourself.
Reliable Debugging
You understand the system, so you can trace bugs, isolate issues, and fix them quickly.
‚ÄúI know why this 500 error is happening‚Äù beats ‚ÄúChatGPT said this should work.‚Äù
Long-Term Skill Growth
Every bug you fix, every feature you write, teaches you something valuable. Your future self becomes 10x stronger.
You‚Äôre not just building apps. You‚Äôre building mastery.
You Become a Creator, Not a Follower
With enough knowledge, you can build your own libraries, tools, and maybe even your own LLM.
You shift from consuming tech to creating it.
You Can Teach Others
Real understanding allows you to help others grow, too. That‚Äôs where leadership and opportunity grow.
‚ùå Cons of Professional Coding
Takes More Time
Writing everything manually, choosing the right patterns, and debugging without AI takes longer.
A simple CRUD app might take hours compared to minutes with AI.
Mental Load Is High
You feel pressure when things break or deadlines loom. It‚Äôs easy to burn out.
‚ÄúWhy is this API not returning data?‚Äù becomes your 2AM nightmare.
Perfectionism Can Slow You Down
Professionals often overthink, over-optimize, and overbuild when ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù would do.
üîç So Which One‚Äôs Better?
That‚Äôs the wrong question. The right one is:
How can you combine the best of both?
üß† Conclusion: Where Vibe Coding Meets Professional Mastery
So, what‚Äôs the verdict?
Vibe coding is powerful. Professional coding is essential. But neither is complete without the other.
Here‚Äôs the truth I‚Äôve learned through experience:
You can build impressive projects using LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini. You can skip the boilerplate, the syntax, the setup. But if you don‚Äôt understand how things work, you‚Äôre not building software you‚Äôre just assembling instructions.
Let‚Äôs be real:
If a startup hands you a low-budget project, blindly following ChatGPT might inflate the tech stack or add unnecessary complexity.
If you copy-paste everything, you risk security flaws, performance issues, and fragile customization.
And if you rely on AI for every single step, you may appear competent on the surface but crack under real-world challenges.
That‚Äôs why I say:
You don‚Äôt need to know everything. But you need to know enough to lead the AI, not follow it blindly.
You need to know:
How web pages are structured.
How to add styles manually and customize them.
What a tech stack means and why it‚Äôs chosen.
What a deployment pipeline looks like.
How to check AI-generated code for risks and inefficiencies.
A basic understanding of the theory behind the logic like why to use linear regression over logistic regression in a given context.
Even if you‚Äôre not technical, prompt engineering becomes your gateway skill. It‚Äôs not just about ‚Äúasking ChatGPT what to do.‚Äù It‚Äôs about crafting precise, strategic prompts to extract meaningful, context-aware output.
üí° Final Thought
We need AI to build faster. But AI still needs us to guide it.
The fear that AI will replace developers? It‚Äôs only half-true. AI will replace those who refuse to learn how to use it effectively. But the ones who understand both technology and AI who grasp architecture and can also accelerate with LLMs won‚Äôt just survive; they‚Äôll thrive. They‚Äôll ship products faster, solve problems smarter, and unlock opportunities others don‚Äôt even see.
I‚Äôll admit sometimes my vibe-coded results didn‚Äôt hit the mark. And maybe that‚Äôs because my prompting wasn‚Äôt strong. But that‚Äôs the point: prompting is a skill, just like coding. You need to build it. And even if you rely on AI to code, you still need to understand the basics. That‚Äôs the real edge: pairing AI fluency with developer intuition.
‚úÖ If you take away one thing from this blog:
Master the fundamentals. Embrace the AI. Combine both and become a 10x developer.

The way I use it is to use chatGPT to come up with ideas and interface components, then use Bolt to generate the interface, and finally I build my own website based on the generated interface.
The main task of AI is to come up with ideas and help me solve errors while building the website, so I can still learn a lot of new things.
