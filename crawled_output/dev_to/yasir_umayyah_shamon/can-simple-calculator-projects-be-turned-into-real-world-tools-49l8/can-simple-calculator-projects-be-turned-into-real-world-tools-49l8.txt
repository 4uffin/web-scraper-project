Can Simple Calculator Projects Be Turned Into Real-World Tools?
#webdev

Most beginners build a basic calculator in JavaScript when learning HTML, CSS, and JS. It’s a great way to practice logic and functions — but here’s my question:
Can we take this simple project and make it solve real-world problems?
My Example: UAE Gratuity Calculator
In the UAE, employees are entitled to gratuity (end-of-service benefits) when they resign or their contract ends.
The problem? The calculation depends on:
Basic salary
Years of service
Contract type (limited or unlimited)
It’s not easy to calculate by hand, so I decided to turn a basic calculator project into a practical tool.
A Small JavaScript Snippet
Here’s a simplified version of the formula:
function calculateGratuity(salary, years) {
if (years < 1) return 0; // Not eligible before 1 year
if (years <= 5) {
return (salary * 21 / 30) * years; // 21 days per year
} else {
const firstFive = (salary * 21 / 30) * 5;
const extraYears = (salary * 30 / 30) * (years - 5);
return firstFive + extraYears;
}
}
The Full Tool
I built a live version here:
https://calculategratuity.ae/
It applies the official UAE labor law and gives instant results.
My Question to You
Have you ever taken a beginner project (like a calculator, to-do app, etc.) and turned it into something that people actually use in real life?
Do you think these kinds of projects are worth building, or should beginners move on quickly to “bigger” projects?
I’d love to hear your thoughts!
