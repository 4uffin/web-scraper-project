Why Are Users Seeing Two Different ‚ÄúEdit Columns‚Äù and ‚ÄúEdit Filters‚Äù Buttons in Dynamics CE Views?

If you‚Äôve recently noticed that some users see two different versions of the Edit Columns and Edit Filters buttons in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement views‚Äîone looking like the classic interface, and the other like the modern grid‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone.
I ran into this exact issue, and after some digging, the culprit turned out to be a feature setting in the Power Platform Admin Center.
The Root Cause: Natural Language Grid and View Search
In the Power Platform Admin Center, there‚Äôs a setting called ‚ÄúNatural language grid and view search‚Äù under Features. This toggle controls how the grid experience behaves for end users.
It has three possible options:
All users immediately ‚Üí Everyone sees the modern grid experience.
No one ‚Üí Everyone stays on the classic grid.
Users as the feature becomes available ‚Üí A mix of classic and modern experiences, depending on the rollout progress.
That last option is where the confusion comes from. With ‚ÄúUsers as the feature becomes available‚Äù, some users get the modern grid while others remain on the classic one. That‚Äôs why different people see different versions of the Edit Columns and Edit Filters buttons.
The Fix
To make the experience consistent across your organisation, you need to update the setting to either:
All users immediately (if you‚Äôre ready to fully adopt the modern grid), or
No one (if you want to stay on the classic grid for now).
This way, all users see the same interface and there‚Äôs no more back-and-forth confusion.
Final Thoughts
This is one of those small but impactful admin settings that can cause a lot of head-scratching for end users. If your team is reporting inconsistent UI in views, check the Natural language grid and view search setting first‚Äîit might just save you a lot of time troubleshooting.
