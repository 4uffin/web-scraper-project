üìä Adding Observability to Gemma 2B on Kubernetes with Prometheus & Grafana
In Article 1
When we first set up Prometheus + Grafana for Gemma 2B on Kubernetes, I expected to see nice dashboards with:
Tokens per request
Latency per inference
Number of inferences processed
‚Ä¶but all we got were boring container metrics: CPU%, memory usage, restarts.
Sure, they told us the pod was alive, but nothing about the model itself.
No clue if inference was slow, if requests were timing out, or how many tokens were processed.
üîç Debugging the Metrics Problem
We checked:
Prometheus scraping the Ollama pod? ‚úÖ
Grafana dashboards connected? ‚úÖ
Metrics endpoint on Ollama? ‚ùå
That‚Äôs when we realized:
Ollama by default doesn‚Äôt expose model-level metrics.
It only serves the API for inference, nothing else.
Prometheus was scraping‚Ä¶ nothing useful.
üí° The Fix: Ollama Exporter as Sidecar
While digging through GitHub issues, we found a project: Ollama Exporter
It runs as a sidecar container inside the same pod as Ollama, talks to the Ollama API, and exposes real metrics at /metrics for Prometheus.
Basically:
[ Ollama Pod ]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Ollama Server (API ‚Üí 11434)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ollama Exporter (Metrics ‚Üí 11435)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üõ† How We Integrated It
Here‚Äôs the snippet we added to the Ollama deployment:
- name: ollama-exporter
image: ghcr.io/jmorganca/ollama-exporter:latest
ports:
- containerPort: 11435
env:
- name: OLLAMA_HOST
value: "http://localhost:11434"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
And in Prometheus config:
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'ollama'
static_configs:
- targets: ['ollama-service:11435']
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üìä The Metrics We Finally Got
After adding the exporter, Grafana lit up with:
Metric Name
What It Shows
ollama_requests_total
Number of inference requests
ollama_latency_seconds
Latency per inference request
ollama_tokens_processed Tokens processed per inference
ollama_model_load_time
Time taken to load Gemma 2B model
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Suddenly, we had real model observability, not just pod health.
üöÄ Lessons Learned
Default Kubernetes metrics ‚â† Model metrics ‚Üí You need a sidecar like Ollama Exporter.
One scrape job away ‚Üí Prometheus won‚Äôt scrape what you don‚Äôt tell it to.
Metrics help tuning ‚Üí We later used these metrics to set CPU/memory requests properl
üîÆ What‚Äôs Next?
Now that we have model-level observability, the next step is:
Adding alerting rules for latency spikes or token errors.
Exporting historical metrics into long-term storage (e.g., Loki, Thanos).
Trying multiple models Gemma 3, LLaMA 3, Phi-3 and comparing inference latency across them.
