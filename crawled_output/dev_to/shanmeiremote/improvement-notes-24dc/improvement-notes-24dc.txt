Just a note for future development of our language & Canadian culture learning app. Enjoy =)
for Flashcard, how to design a workflow for users to re-add the word back to "I don't know" category (if they mis-click)?
for Flahcard point award system, should we change it to "get 2 points after learning vocabs in all category" instead of "get 2 points after complete learning vocab under one category"?
for Video, add full-screen-play option & subtitle embeded in the video;
Home screen widget for users to add vocab to their wordbook;
