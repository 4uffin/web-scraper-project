An open-source, BYOK AI canvas for generating, manipulating, and editing images with AI models.
#react
#ai
#vite
#tailwindcss
Howdy folks! ü§†
I saw this post a few days ago on HN (link) about the new Nano Banana model and decided to play with it. It's incredible! (Mostly for editing IMHO). The thing is, the Google AI Studio is for chat... for images, not so much.
So I decided to make my own thing: an infinite canvas for AI image creations...and it turned out nice!
The idea is to expand it over time: more models, more features, basically a hub for experimenting with image generation.
Would love to hear any feedback, questions, or ideas!
Try it: https://koubou.app/
Repo: https://github.com/za01br/koubou
*Built it with React, Vite, TS, shadcn, and TailwindCSS
*For the Canvas, I'm using React Konva.
