LeetCode Problems Are Just Life Lessons in Disguise

The deeper I go into LeetCode, the more I realize: these problems aren’t just coding puzzles. They’re weirdly accurate metaphors for life itself.
🔹Two Sum
Finding two numbers that complete each other? Yeah, that’s just relationships. Some pairs look like they should work but… nope. And sometimes, the right match is hiding in plain sight.
🔹 Binary Search
Life tip: Don’t overcomplicate things. Go straight to the middle, test, and adjust. No need to waste time running left and right blindly. Balance saves you time (and sanity).
🔹 Dynamic Programming (DP)
Our past struggles aren’t useless — they’re subproblems we’ve already solved. Every bad decision, every retry is just building your DP table for the future. Eventually, you’ll hit that optimal path.
🔹 Greedy Algorithms
Sometimes taking the shiny, obvious choice is the right move. Not everything requires 3D chess thinking. Trust your instincts — at least for local maxima.
🔹 Backtracking
Dating. Enough said. Try a path → realize it doesn’t work → backtrack → try again. Repeat until you find the solution (or just give up and return null).
🔹 Graph Problems
Networking, literally. Some connections open shortcuts, some trap you in cycles, and occasionally… you find a bridge that changes everything.
🔹 Problem 2749 (Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero)
This one? Oh, it’s just adulthood. Life keeps charging you a flat fee (num2) every time you make a move, and all you’ve got are binary coins to pay with. 💸 The real trick is making sure you don’t run out of moves before hitting zero.
🔹 Debugging
Okay, not a problem, but a lifestyle. In life, just like in code:
Sometimes the bug is obvious.
Sometimes it’s one missing semicolon (tiny habit you ignored).
And sometimes… you just stare at it for hours until the solution magically appears in the shower. 🚿
Final Thought
The grind isn’t just about coding. It’s about patience, mindset, and the art of not giving up after 50 WA/TLE submissions.
At the end of the day, we’re not just debugging code — we’re debugging ourselves.
So yeah, maybe LeetCode is secretly the best self-help book nobody asked for.
