Amazon SDE2 OA/Interview Sept 2025 – The Great Cutoff Conspiracy Thread
#webdev

Every year, Amazon’s SDE2 OA feels less like a test and more like a group project where nobody knows the actual syllabus. People are half-passing test cases, half-trusting Reddit screenshots, and fully losing their minds over “what the cutoff really is.”
I didn’t take the OA this time, but figured we might as well stop doom-scrolling in isolation and pool the chaos into one place.
This thread is for:
Scores you’ve heard or seen floating around
Interview call updates (real or rumored)
Region-wise differences, if any
General vibes (brutal? chill? RNG?)
The OA Format (Sept 2025)
Here’s what it usually looks like right now:
Round 1 (Intermediate): mostly DP/partition-type problems.
Round 2 (Advanced): some cursed hybrid of Graph + DP that looks innocent until your test cases start failing one by one.
Time: about 90 minutes.
Platforms: HackerRank or CodeSignal depending on the recruiter’s mood.
What People Are Reporting
Candidate A: 14/14 passed in Intermediate, 3/14 in Advanced → still waiting.
Candidate B: 2 full + 1 partial out of 4 → got the interview call.
Candidate C: 548/600 on CodeSignal → shortlisted.
Candidate D: solved 1.5 questions → rejected, no surprise.
From what I’m seeing, the cutoffs aren’t about “perfect or bust.” Partial solves still seem to get people through if the problem set is brutal.
Why This Thread Exists
So we can stop spiraling every time a single edge case fails. The idea is to crowdsource actual outcomes and build a real picture of what’s happening in Amazon OAs right now.
What You Can Do
If you gave an Amazon SDE2 OA (June–Sept 2025), share:
Which round you gave (Intermediate/Advanced/CodeSignal).
How many test cases you passed.
What happened after (moved forward/rejected/waiting).
Your location/role (helps spot patterns).
Let’s make this the one-stop shop for Amazon OA cutoffs instead of all of us refreshing our emails every 10 minutes wondering if 12/14 test cases is “good enough.”
