Show HN: AI-Powered Email Verification API with ML Risk Scoring + 50% Off for RapidAPI Users

Hey HN! I built an email verification API that actually does more than check if an email looks valid. It combines machine learning risk scoring with real SMTP validation to give you better insight into email quality.
What's Different
Most email validators just tell you "valid" or "invalid". Mine gives you a risk score, explains why, AND tells you whether you should actually send to that email. Like "Don't send - suspicious due to new domain registration" or "Safe to send - verified corporate email". Plus it does the usual SMTP checks - MX records, mailbox verification, catching disposables and role accounts.
The bulk verification handles large lists without timing out, which was a pain point I had with other services.
Why Risk Scoring + Reasoning
Basic verification: "Does this email exist?"
With risk scoring + explanations: "Should I trust this email, and here's exactly why you might not want to."
Having the reasoning helps with:
Manual review decisions (you know what to look for)
Building automated rules for your specific use case
Understanding patterns in your user base
Explaining decisions to stakeholders
Real-World Use Cases
SaaS onboarding (auto-approve low risk, manual review high risk)
E-commerce fraud prevention
Cleaning marketing lists before campaigns
User registration workflows

Built this after getting burned by high false positive rates with existing tools. The ML component learns from validation patterns to be more nuanced than simple rule-based systems.
What's your experience been with email validation? Always curious about edge cases people run into.
