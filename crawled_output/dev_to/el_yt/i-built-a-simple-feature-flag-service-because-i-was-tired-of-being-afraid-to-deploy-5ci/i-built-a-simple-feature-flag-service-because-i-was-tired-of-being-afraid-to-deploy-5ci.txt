I Built a Simple Feature Flag Service Because I Was Tired of Being Afraid to Deploy

*The Problem That Kept Me Up at Night
*
You know that feeling when you're about to deploy to production? That pit in your stomach wondering "what if this breaks everything?"
I was there every single time. Even for small features, I'd spend hours second-guessing myself. Sure, I could use other platforms, but for my projects and small apps, they felt like bringing a bazooka to a water balloon fight - powerful but overkill (and expensive).
So I Built FlagSwift
After one too many "please work" moments hitting the deploy button, I decided to build something simpler.
What it does:
‚úÖ Simple dashboard to create and manage feature flags
‚úÖ React client with a clean FlagProvider component
‚úÖ Per-environment targeting (dev, staging, prod)
‚úÖ Per-user targeting (gradually roll out to specific users)
‚úÖ Team collaboration (invite your devs to test together)
What it doesn't do:
‚ùå Require a PhD to set up
Quick Example
import { FlagProvider, useFlag } from '@flagswift/react-client';
function App() {
return (
<FlagProvider apiKey="your-api-key" environment="production" userId="user123">
<MyComponent />
</FlagProvider>
);
}
function MyComponent() {
const isNewFeatureEnabled = useFlag('new-checkout-flow');
return (
<div>
{isNewFeatureEnabled ?
<NewCheckoutFlow /> :
<OldCheckoutFlow />
}
</div>
);
}`
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Try It Out
Application: FlagSwift
Install: npm install @flagswift/react-client
It's free while in beta
What I'm Looking For:
Honest feedback from real developers:
Would you actually use this? (Please be brutal - I can handle it)
What am I missing? What features would make this a must-have?
What SDKs should I build next? Next.js? Node? Vue? Svelte?
Why I'm Sharing This?
Because I think every developer deserves to deploy without fear. And if this helps even one person sleep better after hitting deploy, it's worth it.
Also, I genuinely want to build something people actually want to use, not just something I think is cool. So please, tear it apart and tell me how to make it better.
Try it out and let me know what you think!
