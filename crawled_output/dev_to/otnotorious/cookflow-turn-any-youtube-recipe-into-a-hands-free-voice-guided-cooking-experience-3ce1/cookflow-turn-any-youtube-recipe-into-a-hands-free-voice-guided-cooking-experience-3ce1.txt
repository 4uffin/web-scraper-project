Google AI Challenge Submission
What I Built
CookFlow+ is a cooking assistant that turns any YouTube recipe video into a hands-free, personalized cooking experience. It solves the pain of pausing, rewinding, and juggling messy hands while trying to cook along with videos.
Paste a link, and CookFlow+ gives you:
Structured Recipes with steps, ingredients, timestamps, and tips from the chef.
Smart Substitutions when you don‚Äôt have an ingredient
Voice-Guided Cooking so you can ask questions, or say ‚Äúnext step‚Äù or ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù while you cook
Video Analysis to find key moments, product mentions, and summaries
Demo
Click me to experienc3 cookflow+
1.Paste any cooking video (e.g. Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Beef Wellington) to generate recipes
2.Use voice to navigate while cooking, swap ingredients, or ask for alternatives
3.See timestamps and highlights pulled directly from the video
Gemini 2.5 Pro:
video-to-recipe analysis
Gemini 2.5 Flash: Fast ingredient swaps and substitutions
Gemini 2.5 Flash Audio Dialog: Real-time voice assistant with interruption handling
Gemini 2.5 Flash Image: Step thumbnails and visual context
Example integration:
const videoPart = Part.fromUri(youtubeUrl, "video/youtube");
const result = await model.generateContent([recipePrompt, videoPart]);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Multimodal Features
Video Understanding: Extracts recipes, techniques, and timestamps directly from video.
Voice Interaction: Hands-free step navigation, substitutions, and Q&A while cooking.
Visual Context: Uses rear camera for progress checks and guidance.
Content Enhancement: AI suggests substitutions with correct ratios and roles (fat, acid, etc.).
Cross-Modal Processing: Syncs video, audio, and text into structured, easy-to-follow recipes.
Bonus features
You can:
save a recipe to come back later.
Export a text/json file to share with other people.
Before CookFlow+: Cooking from YouTube meant constant pausing, ingredient confusion, and messy hands.
With CookFlow+: Recipes are clear, interactive, and adaptive‚Äîyour kitchen becomes fully AI-assisted.
