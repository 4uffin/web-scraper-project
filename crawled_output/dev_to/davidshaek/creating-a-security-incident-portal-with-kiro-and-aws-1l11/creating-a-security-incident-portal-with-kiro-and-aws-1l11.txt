Creating a Security Incident Portal with Kiro and AWS
#aws
#todayilearned
#programming
#webdev
This article aims to showcase how Kiro’s features can be used to build a simple security incident portal, hosted on AWS with services like Lambda, Secrets Manager, S3, and CloudFront, while leveraging MSAL Entra ID for authentication.
Requirements
AWS account
MSAL Entra ID
Kiro
Note: This project was made with Kiro before the release of their pricing plan.
The proposed architecture
What is Kiro?
Kiro IDE is an AI powered development environment designed to speed up software creation. Instead of starting with manual boilerplate code, you interact with Kiro in natural language. You can describe what you want to build, and Kiro generates the project structure, code, and configurations.
Find it here
What is Vibe coding?
Vibe coding is a development style where you start writing software through natural conversation or free form prompts instead of rigid plans or detailed specifications. The focus is on exploration and iteration, you describe what you want, review what’s generated, and refine it step by step.
Kiro Vibe Mode vs Spec
Kiro offers two ways to start your project:
Vibe: Chat first, then build. You provide a prompt with your requirements, Kiro generates code, and you give feedback on the output.
Spec: Plan first, then build. You give Kiro a detailed set of instructions, similar to a PRD (Product Requirements Document) that outlines the purpose and functionality of the product/feature.
In my experience, especially during Kiro’s early days, Spec mode quickly ran out of requests and often did a poor job completing specific tasks. Some requests timed out, others didn’t match the requirements, and the code started looking like spaghetti. This led me to restart the project from scratch.
That’s when I switched to Kiro Vibe mode. Here, I interacted with Kiro through specific prompts about what I needed. I began with the frontend project. Since I wanted to test Kiro’s capabilities, I was intentionally vague and only specified that I wanted a form to report security incidents. Kiro quickly proposed a solution stack: Vite + React. With continuous feedback and iteration, it took me about two days to build the frontend—though I was limited by Kiro’s daily request cap. Without that limitation, it probably would have been faster.
Note: This project, while necessary, started as a side project in my free time. The main goal was to explore how popular LLM tools could be leveraged for vibe coding and to see the results. Sure, I could have coded everything manually, but that would have required writing unit tests, creating user stories, designing in Figma, and more. With Kiro, I was able to focus on delivering an MVP as quickly as possible.
Walkthrough
After installing Kiro IDE, create a project. Feel free to organize both the backend and frontend into two folders.
Something about the risk of Autopilot
While Autopilot can be an awesome tool—allowing Kiro to update multiple files automatically—it can also be a double-edged sword. Letting changes go through without review might introduce unnecessary code or even break the codebase. In some cases, other LLM coding assistants have executed terminal commands that interacted with projects and even deleted databases !
I can’t stress enough that these types of tools should only be used in offline or development environments, not directly in production
Fortunately, Kiro’s default behavior is to prompt you before authorizing any script or command execution.
After some prompting
It is very important to keep in mind that if Autopilot is active, it can lead to massive changes in the codebase. This may result in some functionalities being abandoned or replaced with unnecessary code. To mitigate this risk, I recommend managing our project with git and maintaining a README.MD file for context use, this file is useful if we runout of context window, since it provides a quick reference that allows another session to continue working with the same background knowledge
Frontend structure
Note: The code will be at the final of this article in a git repository.
We start by building our frontend with the following prompts:
I would like to create a security incident portal where users can authenticate with their organization email using MSAL. The portal should support two roles: User (can only submit reports through a security report form) and Admin (can view submitted reports in a dashboard). Please generate the frontend project structure, including components for login, forms, common UI elements, and an admin dashboard.
Please organice the project in a good practice matter, be sure to separate the logic on different components
The user role should be able to fill a form with fields related to a IT security incident, be sure to add fields that details the case, the admin role should be able to view this cases in a dashboard with the option to resolve this reports with a modal view.
The admin should be also be able to download a report of this incidents in the dashboard tab, through a csv file, please add a button with the option to download the reports including the detailed information
Note: There was a process of debugging and asking other prompts for fixing some aspects
Our frontend is being described as the follow:
components/: All UI building blocks.
admin/: admin dashboard & modals.
auth/: login screen and Microsoft (MSAL) button.
common/: reusable UI bits (logo, spinner, success/error modals).
forms/: the security incident report form.
config/: App configuration and constants
constants.js → shared constants (app names, messages, etc.).
lambdaUrls.js → API/Lambda endpoints.
msalConfig.js → MSAL/Entra ID settings (clientId, authority, redirect).
roles.js → role names/permissions used for RBAC.
hooks/: Reusable logic as React hooks:
useRequests.js → fetch/POST helpers to your APIs.
useUserRole.js → derive the user’s role from MSAL claims or app state.
Main/Root files
App.jsx → The root UI shell (routes/layout). It wires providers, nav, and renders pages/components based on auth/role.
main.jsx →
The entry point creates the React root and mounts
(often wraps with MSAL/Context providers).
App.css / index.css → Global styles.
env.example → Sample environment variables to copy to your local .env.
eslint.config.js → Linting rules.
companylog.webp → Brand/logo asset.

Authentication
Before we can execute our code we have some parameters that need to be filled.
In this application we will use Entra ID MSAL authentication, since most organizations has a corporate email through Microsoft.
For this we go to Microsoft Entra Admin Center > App Registrations > New Registration
In the registration we will give it a name select our current single tenant, and for Redirect URI we will select Web and add our localhost
Note: We will later deploy this in a bucket using cloudfront and route53
After registering our app we will copy the ClientID and the TenantID
And replace it in our code at config > msalConfig.js
// msalConfig.js - MSAL authentication configuration
import { PublicClientApplication } from '@azure/msal-browser';
// Get configuration from environment variables with fallbacks
const clientId = import.meta.env.VITE_MSAL_CLIENT_ID || "<your-client-id>";
const tenantId = import.meta.env.VITE_MSAL_TENANT_ID || "<your-tenant-id>";
export const msalConfig = {
auth: {
clientId: clientId,
authority: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/${tenantId}`,
redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/",
},
cache: {
cacheLocation: "sessionStorage",
storeAuthStateInCookie: true,
},
};
export const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(msalConfig);

Exit fullscreen mode
Running our frontend
Now we can test out our frontend view by running the following command:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Our login landpage should look like this:
The form:
The dashboard:
Now that our that we check our frontend is working at a mock level let's proceed uploading our frontend to AWS.
For this we execute
npm run build
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This will generate a dist folder in our project with the following content
dist/
├─ index.html
├─ vite.sg
├─ assets/
│
├─ admin/
│
│
├─ index.js
│
│
└─ index.css
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Frontend from local to AWS
Now we are going to create an S3 bucket, we can configure it with the default settings, as we are going to use S3 origin access with cloudfront there is no need to make the bucket public we securely expose it through it.
We go into the AWS Console > S3 Bucket > We left everything as is.
Note: You might check what object locking and versioning can do, normally we handle our frontend through a CI/CD process, but for this example I will upload the files directly into the bucket.
After creating we bucket before we upload our files we will go into Properties > Static website hosting.
We will enabled it as Bucket hosting and set index.html as default
Our files in our S3
Now let's proceed with the cloudfront creation:
For this we give our distribution a name, we are going to use a custom domain since I already have a route53 and my certificate loaded at ACM I will use that, otherwise you can use the provided link at cloudfront or just use s3 directly.
Here we will use our bucket as a origin, be sure to select the s3 endpoint not the website, as we will configure the s3 endpoint with origin access, AWS cloudfront will provide a policy that should be added to the bucket.
The policy goes at the permission tab of our bucket at bucket policy, it should look similar to this
{
"Version": "2008-10-17",
"Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
},
"Action": "s3:GetObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::security-portal.company.net/*",
"Condition": {
"StringEquals": {
"AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111882899112:distribution/E1DCXJC9B8PVOV"
}
}
}
]
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
After that feel free to setup WAF and security features to the cloudfront distribution for this example, I will keep it as simple as possible.
After the distribution is created you have two options to register that alternative domain, you can copy the url provided by cloudfront and register it at your registar or route53 as an A record or CNAME or if. you use route53 you can directly add both required records by pressing the button Route Domains to Cloudfront
Finally we have our frontend ready, however there is one big task left. Entering the backend.
Note: Don't forget to add the new domain to MSAL config !
Backend structure
For our backend we will manage a simple architecture based on an small mysql rds database and a lambda, the lambda will be deployed on a VPC that has a peering connection between the VPC of the database, otherwise if your database is public or lives in the same VPC there might be no need to do this.
Our frontend is being described as the follow:
├─ database/
│
├─ schema.sql/
├─ lambda/
│
├─ node-modules/
│
├─ index.js
│
├─ package.json
│
├─ package-lock.json
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
database/: Database sql script
schema.sql → full MySQL 8.0 DDL: tables (requests, request_comments, user_roles, request_audit_log), request_stats view, seed admins, sample data.
lambda/: Python 3.13 with URI Function and VPC
index.js → main Lambda handler & router (health, auth role lookup, list/create requests, stats, update status). Includes MySQL pool, JSON helpers, ID generators, Teams/Power Automate notifier, and CORS.
package.json → Node project manifest (runtime entrypoint, scripts, deps like mysql2/promise).
package-lock.json → exact dependency lock for reproducible builds.
node_modules/ → installed npm packages used by the Lambda at runtime.
For our database we are going to use the following script:
-- Security Incident Portal Database Schema
-- Production-ready schema for MySQL 8.0+
-- Database: SecurityIncidentPortal
-- Create the database if it doesn't exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SecurityIncidentPortal CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

The SQL script defines normalized tables for incidents (requests), threaded discussions (request_comments), role-based access (user_roles), and an immutable change history (request_audit_log). It adds strategic indexes and CHECK constraints for data integrity and query performance, builds a request_stats view that powers dashboards (status/type/priority/time-window counts and average processing time), seeds an admin account,
With this script we fill basically use for the following API:
User should be able to fill a form with required and optional fields from different type such as string, timestamp, floats, emails
User should have two roles user and admin, admin is the only role that is capable of viewing the dashboard, add investigation notes and set incident reports to solved, canceled or closed
User should be able to see a small metric on how many reports exist, how many are critical, how many are solved
With this in mind we are going to proceed to create our RDS database and our lambda.
In the AWS Console, we search for Aurora and RDS > Databases > Create Database, for this example we are going to use MYSQL in a free tier environment with engine 8.0.x
As a good practice we should use secrets manager to manage our database password, this also enables us to program password rotation and other neat stuff.
For the instance type a t4g.micro is good enough depending on our workload, and the size feel free to edit it to your needs
For other configurations select your database vpc, feel free to tune your logs, backup and maintance window, after configuring and creating the database proceed to execute the .sql script.
Now we can create our lambda, we search for the service called Lambda > Create Function.
For our lambda, give it a name like security-api, let the lambda create the execution role and be sure to enable Function URL and VPC (if your database is not public)
Now for our lambda upload the code provided in the github repository at the end of this article and copy the url this url should be the one that needs to be replaced at our frontend
Note: The lambda uses environment variables however it is recommended to use secrets manager and handle this access through code.
Finally we have our security incident portal ready to go !
Lessons learned and a conclusion
While Kiro is a powerful tool that can help developers accelerate their SDLC process, it still requires close supervision. There is significant feedback and debugging needed, such as addressing unnecessary functions, security concerns, and a lack of unit tests. These challenges, however, can be mitigated by following a proper SDLC process, using Kiro to support each phase and ensuring a solid PRD is in place. I’m excited to see what the future holds there is still much potential yet to be revealed !
