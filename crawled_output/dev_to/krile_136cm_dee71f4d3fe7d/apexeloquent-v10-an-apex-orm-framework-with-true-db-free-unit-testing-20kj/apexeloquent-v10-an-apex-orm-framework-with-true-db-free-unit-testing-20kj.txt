ApexEloquent v1.0 â€“ An Apex ORM Framework with True DB-Free Unit Testing
#testing

Iâ€™m excited to announce the release of ApexEloquent v1.0, an open-source ORM framework for Salesforce Apex (Apache 2.0).
Inspired by Laravelâ€™s Eloquent, itâ€™s designed specifically for Salesforce developers to make working with SOQL and relationships easier, safer, and fully testable.
Why ApexEloquent?
Many Salesforce developers face these common pain points:
Verbose and brittle SOQL queries
Complex parent/child/many-to-many relationship handling
Slow and fragile database-dependent unit tests
ApexEloquent solves these by providing:
Fluent & safe query construction â€“ write queries like natural sentences
Effortless relationship handling â€“ access parent, child, and junction objects intuitively
True DB-free unit testing â€“ MockEloquent lets you run fast, isolated tests without any DML or SOQL
Quick Example
// Fetch Opportunities with Amount > 100,000
Scribe scribe = Scribe.source(Opportunity.getSObjectType())
.fields(new List<String>{'Id','Name','Amount'})
.whereGreaterThan('Amount', 100000);
List<IEntry> opps = (new Eloquent()).get(scribe);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
With MockEloquent, the same queries can be tested without touching the database, making your unit tests faster and more reliable.

Iâ€™d love to hear feedback from the community!
Have you tried similar ORM approaches in Apex? How do you handle database-independent testing in your projects?
