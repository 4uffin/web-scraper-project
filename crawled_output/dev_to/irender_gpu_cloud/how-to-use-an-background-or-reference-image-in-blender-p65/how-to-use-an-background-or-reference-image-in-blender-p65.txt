How to use an background or reference image in Blender

Introduction
When modeling in Blender, adding a background or reference image is one of the fastest ways to keep your proportions accurate and speed up the workflow. Whether youâ€™re modeling a character from a sketch or aligning architecture plans, Blender 4.x makes it easy to set up images directly in the viewport.
This guide explains the current methods (2025) to add and manage reference images in Blender, and highlights the most effective workflows for artists.
1. Add a Reference or Background Image (Empty Image)
The simplest way to insert an image in Blender is by creating an Empty Image object.
Steps:
Go to the 3D Viewport.
Press Shift + A â†’ Image â†’ Reference (or Background).
Reference Image: Oriented to the current view.
Background Image: Positioned in world space behind objects.
Choose your image file.
Once added, the image will appear in the viewport as a flat, non-renderable object.
Tip: In the Object Data Properties panel (green image icon), you can adjust:
Opacity (make it semi-transparent)
Depth (in front or behind objects)
Side (both sides or only front-facing)
Size & rotation
This method is ideal for blueprints, sketches, and orthographic modeling.
2. Drag and Drop an Image into the Viewport
Blender 4.x also supports drag-and-drop:
Simply drag an image from your file explorer into the 3D Viewport.
It automatically creates a Reference Image (Empty Image).
This is the quickest way to bring in reference images without menu navigation.
3. Import Images as Planes (Add-on)
If you want your image to be visible in renders, not just in the viewport, use the Import Images as Planes add-on (included with Blender).
Enable the add-on:
Go to Edit â†’ Preferences â†’ Add-ons.
Search for Import Images as Planes.
Tick the checkbox to enable.
Steps to use:
Press Shift + A â†’ Image â†’ Images as Planes.
Select your image file.
Blender creates a plane mesh with the image applied as a texture.
Advantages:
The image will render with lights and materials.
Useful for creating billboards, mockups, or background plates.
4. Best Practices for Reference Images in Blender
Place reference images in separate collections for better organization.
Use orthographic view (Numpad 1/3/7) to align images precisely.
Keep images low opacity so the 3D model stands out.
For complex projects, store all reference images in a dedicated /textures or /refs folder to avoid missing file errors.
Conclusion
In Blender 4.x, adding background or reference images is straightforward:
Use Reference/Background (Empty Image) for viewport-only guides.
Use Import Images as Planes when you need the image visible in renders.
By mastering these methods, youâ€™ll improve modeling accuracy and save time on every project.
