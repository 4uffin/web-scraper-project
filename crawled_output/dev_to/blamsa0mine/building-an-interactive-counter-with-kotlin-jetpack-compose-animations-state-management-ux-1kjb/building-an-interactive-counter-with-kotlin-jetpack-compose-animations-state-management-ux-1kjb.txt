When building interactive UI components with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, the simple counter is often overlooked. But how do you create a counter that's not just functional, but delightful? One that demonstrates advanced Kotlin features like higher-order functions, smart state management, smooth animations, and elegant error handling ?
In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through a production-ready Counter component that showcases Kotlin's expressiveness combined with Compose's animation capabilities. We'll explore patterns like undo functionality with Snackbars, progress tracking, smooth animations, and component composition that makes your UI both beautiful and maintainable.
By the end of this article, you'll understand how to build engaging, interactive components that leverage Kotlin's language features for superior user experiences.
🏗️ Architecture: Kotlin's Function Composition Excellence
Our Counter demonstrates component composition and separation of concerns using Kotlin's powerful function capabilities:
@Composable
fun CounterSection(target: Int = 10, step: Int = 1) {
var count by rememberSaveable { mutableIntStateOf(0) }
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
val snackbarHost = remember { SnackbarHostState() }
Scaffold(snackbarHost = { SnackbarHost(snackbarHost) }) { padding ->
CounterContent(
count = count,
target = target,
onIncrement = { count += step },
onDecrement = { if (count > 0) count -= step },
onReset = { /* undo logic */ },
modifier = Modifier.padding(padding)
)
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Why This Kotlin-First Architecture Excels:
🎯 Higher-Order Functions as Props:
onIncrement = { count += step },
onDecrement = { if (count > 0) count -= step }
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Lambda Expressions: Clean, readable event handling
Closure Capture: Access to local state without complex passing
Type Safety: Compiler ensures correct function signatures
🔒 Immutable Parameters with Defaults:
fun CounterSection(target: Int = 10, step: Int = 1)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Default Values: Kotlin's parameter defaults reduce boilerplate
Named Parameters: CounterSection(target = 5, step = 2) for clarity
Type Safety: Int parameters prevent runtime type errors
⚡ Smart State Management:
var count by rememberSaveable { mutableIntStateOf(0) }
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Property Delegation: by keyword creates clean syntax
Configuration Survival: State survives screen rotations automatically
Type-Specific State: mutableIntStateOf is optimized for integers
📊 Advanced State Management: Kotlin's Reactive Patterns
Let's dive into the sophisticated state management that powers our counter:
@Composable
fun CounterSection(target: Int = 10, step: Int = 1) {
// Core state with automatic persistence
var count by rememberSaveable { mutableIntStateOf(0) }
// Coroutine scope for async operations
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
// Snackbar state for undo functionality
val snackbarHost = remember { SnackbarHostState() }
// Derived state and smart calculations
val progress = if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
val reached = target in 1..count
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Kotlin State Management Highlights:
🎯 Derived State with Smart Calculations:
val progress = if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
val reached = target in 1..count
// Range operator for elegant logic
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
💎 Kotlin Features in Action:
Range Operators: target in 1..count is more readable than target >= 1 && target <= count
Extension Functions: coerceIn(0f, 1f) ensures safe bounds
Type Conversion: Explicit toFloat() for precise calculations
Elvis Operator Alternative: Using if expressions for clarity
🔒 Safe State Operations:
onDecrement = { if (count > 0) count -= step }
// Prevents negative values
onReset = { /* Complex undo logic with snackbar */ }
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🎭 Animation Excellence: Kotlin DSL + Compose Magic
Our counter showcases smooth animations using Kotlin's expressive DSL syntax:
AnimatedContent(
targetState = count,
transitionSpec = {
fadeIn(tween(180)) togetherWith fadeOut(tween(180))
},
label = "count-anim"
) { value ->
Text(
"Tu as cliqué $value fois",
style = MaterialTheme.typography.headlineSmall,
color = if (reached) MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary else LocalContentColor.current
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Kotlin Animation DSL Breakdown:
🎨 Declarative Animation Syntax:
fadeIn(tween(180)) togetherWith fadeOut(tween(180))
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Infix Functions: togetherWith creates readable animation combinations
DSL Builder: tween(180) uses Kotlin's builder pattern for animation specs
Method Chaining: Compose animations leverage Kotlin's fluent interfaces
⚡ Smart Content Transitions:
AnimatedContent(targetState = count) { value ->
Text("Tu as cliqué $value fois")
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Lambda with Receiver: The value parameter gets the current animated state
Automatic Triggering: Animation runs whenever count changes
Type Safety: value is strongly typed as Int
🎯 Conditional Styling with Kotlin:
color = if (reached) MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary else LocalContentColor.current
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Ternary-like Logic: Kotlin's if expressions for conditional values
Material Design Integration: Smart color selection based on state
🚀 Advanced UX: Undo Functionality with Kotlin Coroutines
Our counter implements sophisticated undo functionality using Kotlin's coroutine capabilities:
onReset = {
val before = count
// Capture current state
count = 0
// Immediate reset for responsive UI
scope.launch {
// Async snackbar handling
val result = snackbarHost.showSnackbar(
message = "Compteur remis à zéro",
actionLabel = "Annuler",
withDismissAction = true
)
// Handle user response
if (result == SnackbarResult.ActionPerformed) {
count = before
// Restore previous value
}
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Advanced Kotlin UX Patterns:
🎯 State Snapshot Pattern:
val before = count
// Immutable snapshot
count = 0
// Immediate UI update
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Optimistic Updates: UI responds immediately
State Capture: Previous value stored for potential restoration
Immutable References: val before prevents accidental modification
⚡ Coroutine-Based Async UX:
scope.launch {
val result = snackbarHost.showSnackbar(/* params */)
if (result == SnackbarResult.ActionPerformed) count = before
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Non-Blocking UI: Snackbar doesn't freeze the interface
Structured Concurrency: scope.launch ties coroutine to component lifecycle
Result Handling: Elegant enum-based result processing
🔧 Kotlin Enum Advantages:
if (result == SnackbarResult.ActionPerformed)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Type Safety: Compile-time verification of result types
Exhaustive Checking: Compiler ensures all cases are handled
No Magic Strings: Enum values prevent typos
🎨 Component Composition: Kotlin's Function Excellence
Our architecture demonstrates clean separation using Kotlin's function composition:
@Composable
private fun CounterContent(
count: Int,
target: Int,
onIncrement: () -> Unit,
onDecrement: () -> Unit,
onReset: () -> Unit,
modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
val progress = if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
val reached = target in 1..count
Column(
modifier = modifier,
verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(16.dp),
horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
) {
// Pure UI rendering logic
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode

onIncrement: () -> Unit,
onDecrement: () -> Unit,
onReset: () -> Unit
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Higher-Order Functions: Clean event handling without interfaces
Type Safety: () -> Unit ensures no return value expected
Lambda Support: Callers can pass inline lambdas or function references
🔒 Immutable Props Pattern:
count: Int,
// Read-only state
target: Int,
// Configuration parameter
modifier: Modifier = Modifier
// Styling with default
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Pure Functions: No side effects in presentation layer
Predictable Rendering: Same inputs always produce same output
Easy Testing: Pure functions are simple to test
⚡ Derived State Calculations:
val progress = if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
val reached = target in 1..count
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Local Calculations: Derived state computed in presentation layer
Performance: Simple calculations don't need memoization
Readability: Logic is clear and self-documenting
🎯 Smart Button Logic: Kotlin's Conditional Excellence
Our button states demonstrate Kotlin's expressive conditional logic:
Row(
horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(12.dp),
verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
) {
IconButton(
onClick = onDecrement,
enabled = count > 0
// Smart enabling
) {
Icon(Icons.Filled.Remove, contentDescription = "Décrémenter")
}
Button(onClick = onIncrement) {
Icon(Icons.Filled.Add, contentDescription = null)
Spacer(Modifier.width(8.dp))
Text("Incrémenter")
}
OutlinedButton(
onClick = onReset,
enabled = count != 0
// Only enable when there's something to reset
) {
Text("Réinitialiser")
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Kotlin Button Logic Patterns:
🎯 Smart State-Based Enabling:
enabled = count > 0
// Decrement only when positive
enabled = count != 0
// Reset only when non-zero
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Boolean Expressions: Direct state-to-UI mapping
No Complex Logic: Simple, readable conditions
Automatic Updates: UI enables/disables as state changes
⚡ Material Design Integration:
Icon(Icons.Filled.Add, contentDescription = null)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode

Accessibility: contentDescription for screen readers
Null Safety: Kotlin's null handling for optional descriptions
🏃‍♂️ Progress Tracking: Kotlin's Mathematical Elegance
Our progress calculation showcases Kotlin's mathematical expressiveness:
// In CounterContent composable
val progress = if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
val reached = target in 1..count
// Progress indicator
if (target > 0) {
LinearProgressIndicator(
progress = { progress },
modifier = Modifier
.fillMaxWidth()
.height(4.dp)
)
Text(
if (reached) "Objectif atteint 🎉" else "Objectif : $target",
style = MaterialTheme.typography.labelMedium
)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Kotlin Mathematical Features:
🔢 Safe Division with Guards:
if (target > 0) (count.toFloat() / target).coerceIn(0f, 1f) else 0f
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Division by Zero Protection: Guard clause prevents runtime errors
Explicit Type Conversion: toFloat() for precise calculations
Bounds Checking: coerceIn(0f, 1f) ensures valid progress values
📏 Range Operator for State Checking:
