Enabling Small Businesses to Invoice in Regional Currencies

Africa has the youngest and second-largest population in the world, making it a prime target for online retail. With growing internet access driven by widespread smartphone adoption, mobile e-commerce has become the dominant way people shop online.
This surge in digital activity presents massive opportunities for small businesses across the continent. However, it also brings unique challenges, especially when it comes to managing cross-border payments and financial tasks like invoicing.
While invoicing may be simple at first, it quickly becomes complex as businesses expand internationally. Currency conversions, exchange rate fluctuations, and varying tax compliance turn a basic task into a more demanding process.
This guide will show you how to scale your current setup to build an invoicing solution that supports cross-border transactions. We'll look at detecting customer currencies automatically, generating clear and compliant invoices, and reconciling payments accurately.
But before we dive into the how-to, let’s take a quick look at what e-commerce platforms are, why they matter for small businesses, and the key challenges they face when dealing with cross-border invoicing.
What are E-commerce Platforms?
E-commerce platforms are online systems that allow businesses to buy and sell products or services over the internet. They offer the tools needed to manage an online storefront, making it easy for customers to browse through products or services, select variations like size, color, or weight, and complete their purchase securely.
These platforms typically come with built-in features like product listings, shopping carts, payment processing, order tracking, and more. By handling the heavy lifting of hosting and design, many e-commerce platforms allow businesses to spend less time on technical setup and more time focusing on growth.
For small businesses, e-commerce platforms open up new opportunities. Without the need for a physical storefront, businesses can reach wider audiences, make sales around the clock, and manage day-to-day operations more efficiently.
As you consider taking your business online, it's important to remember that not all e-commerce platforms are the same. The right platform can make everyday operations easier, support your business goals, and grow with you over time. To help you choose wisely, here are some key features to look for:
Product Listing System: Look for a platform that lets you easily add, update, or remove product listings. This is helpful if your catalog changes frequently or if you run discounts and sales promotions regularly.
Inventory Tracker: You don’t want to be caught off guard by low stock. Choose a platform that tracks your inventory in real time, allows you to set alerts for when stock is running low, and sends notifications so you can restock promptly.
Checkout Experience and Payment Gateway: A good payment provider should offer a smooth checkout process and support local payment methods, such as bank transfers, credit and debit cards, mobile money, and more, that your customers might prefer to use for payment.
Analytics and Reporting: You’ll want access to key metrics like daily orders, revenue, and customer behavior. These insights help you understand what’s working and where to focus your efforts.
Customization: A strong e-commerce platform should let you customize the look and feel of your store. Features like drag-and-drop editors, pre-built templates, and branding tools can help you create a professional-looking storefront without writing a line of code.
What are the Common Challenges Small Businesses Face with E-commerce Invoicing?
Small businesses often face several challenges when sending and receiving invoices across different countries, which can affect customer relationships, cash flow, and compliance.
Below are some of the challenges businesses face:
Currency and Exchange Rate Issue: Exchange rates fluctuate frequently, making it challenging to price invoices accurately in different currencies. If the rate used is too high or too low, it can affect your profit margins or confuse the customer.
Complex Tax Regulations: Each country has its own tax laws, such as VAT, GST, and import and export duties. Errors in applying these taxes or adhering to invoicing rules on invoices can lead to fines, delayed payments, or even legal trouble.
Delayed Payments and Longer Settlement Times: International transfers often take several days to process. These delays can tie up funds and affect day-to-day operations, especially if your business relies on quick turnaround times for working capital.
Disputes Over Invoices: Differences in language, unclear terms, or incompatible accounting systems can lead to misunderstandings. This may result in disputed charges, refund requests, or chargebacks that consume time and resources.
Security and Fraud Risk: International payments and transactions are attractive targets for scammers. Fake invoices, phishing emails, and other fraud attempts can result in lost funds and hurt your brand’s reputation if customers are affected.
Enabling Regional Payments in Your Invoicing System with Flutterwave
To support regional currencies, you can leverage Flutterwave’s APIs to extend your existing e-invoicing system by following the steps below.
Note: This implementation uses the Flutterwave v3 API.
Step 1: Set up Multi-Currency Foundation
To get started, you need to create a robust foundation for all the various currencies you want to support.
// Initialize supported currencies
const supportedCurrencies = [
'NGN',
'GHS',
'KES',
'UGX',
'TZS',
'RWF',
'ZMW',
'XOF',
'XAF',
];
// Configure currency settings
const currencyConfig = {
NGN: { symbol: '₦', decimal: 2, name: 'Nigerian Naira' },
GHS: { symbol: '₵', decimal: 2, name: 'Ghanaian Cedi' },
KES: { symbol: 'KSh', decimal: 2, name: 'Kenyan Shilling' },
// Add other currencies as needed
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: Smart Currency Detection and Selection
Modern invoicing solutions need to intelligently detect the appropriate currency based on customer location or preference. This feature reduces friction in the invoicing process and improves customer experience.
You can use your customers' data to build a helper function that automatically detects and selects currency:
async function detectCustomerCurrency(customerData) {
const countryToCurrency = {
NG: 'NGN',
GH: 'GHS',
KE: 'KES',
UG: 'UGX',
TZ: 'TZS',
RW: 'RWF',
ZM: 'ZMW',
};
// First check customer preference
if (customerData.preferredCurrency) {
return customerData.preferredCurrency;
}
// Then check billing address
if (customerData.billingAddress && customerData.billingAddress.country) {
return countryToCurrency[customerData.billingAddress.country] || 'USD';
}
// Default to business base currency
return 'NGN';
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Real-Time Exchange Rate Management
Exchange rates change constantly, and your invoicing system needs to reflect current market conditions. Flutterwave provides real-time exchange rate data that you can integrate into your invoicing workflow.
async function getCurrentExchangeRate(fromCurrency, toCurrency, amount = 1) {
const url = `https://api.flutterwave.com/v3/transfers/rates?amount=${amount}&source_currency=${fromCurrency}&destination_currency=${toCurrency}`;
try {
const response = await fetch(url, {
method: 'GET',
headers: {
Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY', // Replace with your actual secret key
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
Accept: 'application/json',
},
});
const json = await response.json();
if (json.status === 'success') {
return json.data.rate;
} else {
console.error('Failed to fetch exchange rate:', json.message);
}
} catch (error) {
console.error('Exchange rate fetch failed:', error);
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Format the Currency
You want your customers to see the currency used in their invoice in a format they are used to:
function formatCurrencyAmount(amount, currency) {
const config = currencyConfig[currency];
return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
style: 'currency',
currency: currency,
minimumFractionDigits: config.decimal,
maximumFractionDigits: config.decimal,
}).format(amount);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 5: Bringing it Together — Creating the Invoice Data with the Helper Functions
To generate an invoice that works for customers in different regions, with varying currencies and formats they’ll easily understand, use the helper functions to generate the required data as shown below:
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid'; // install UUID package (npm install uuid)
async function generateInvoice(invoiceData) {
const customerCurrency = await detectCustomerCurrency(invoiceData.customer);
const baseCurrency = invoiceData.business.baseCurrency || 'NGN';
let invoicePayload = {
tx_ref: `INV-${Date.now()}-${uuidv4()}`,
amount: invoiceData.amount,
currency: customerCurrency,
customer: {
email: invoiceData.customer.email,
name: invoiceData.customer.name,
phone_number: invoiceData.customer.phone,
},
meta: {
consumer_id: invoiceData.customer.id,
business_id: invoiceData.business.id,
},
customizations: {
title: invoiceData.business.name,
description: invoiceData.description,
logo: invoiceData.business.logo,
},
};
// Add exchange rate information and formatted amounts
if (customerCurrency !== baseCurrency) {
const exchangeRate = await getCurrentExchangeRate(
baseCurrency,
customerCurrency
);
if (!exchangeRate || isNaN(exchangeRate)) {
throw new Error('Unable to fetch exchange rate');
}
const baseAmount = parseFloat(
(invoiceData.amount / exchangeRate).toFixed(2)
);
invoicePayload.meta.exchange_rate = exchangeRate;
invoicePayload.meta.base_currency = baseCurrency;
invoicePayload.meta.base_amount = baseAmount;
invoicePayload.meta.base_amount_formatted = formatCurrencyAmount(
baseAmount,
baseCurrency
);
}
// Optional: formatted display amount for the customer's view
invoicePayload.meta.amount_formatted = formatCurrencyAmount(
invoiceData.amount,
customerCurrency
);
return invoicePayload;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Beyond the issue of real-time exchange rates when invoicing across borders, another challenge you’ll face as a small business owner is collecting and reconciling payments. When you run a multi-currency business, you need a clear financial reporting system that tracks performance across different currencies while still providing a consolidated view for better decision-making. Flutterwave can help with that, too.
Flutterwave operates in over 34 countries and complies with key regulations, including PCI-DSS for card transactions and local anti-money laundering (AML) laws. It also supports Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), encryption, and tokenization. That means your transactions stay secure without adding extra code complexity, making it easier to get paid in other countries.
When it comes to managing payment collection, Flutterwave gives you a controlled environment where you can reconcile payments in real-time using virtual accounts. Depending on your needs, you can create two types of virtual accounts:
Dynamic Virtual Account: A temporary account typically used for one-time transactions. It’s valid only for a set period or until payment is completed.
Static Virtual Account: A long-term account that’s ideal for recurring payments like subscriptions.
By choosing the right type of virtual account, you can match your payment collection method to your business model, creating streamlined operations and better customer experiences.
Wrapping Up
Multi-currency invoicing capabilities open doors for small businesses in Africa to expand regionally and compete in larger markets. As payment infrastructure continues to grow across the continent, businesses with flexible invoicing systems will be better positioned to seize new opportunities. With Flutterwave’s APIs, you can build intuitive systems that make multi-currency invoicing more accessible for your business.
