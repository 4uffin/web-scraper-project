Buildstash Product Update - Metadata artifacts, custom targets, RTOS platforms..
#devops
#devtools
#cicd

Buildstash is the home for your software binaries. We're excited to share a huge product update with you this week.
Let's get into it -
Metadata artifacts
Metadata artifacts can now be attached to your builds. These might include SBOM (software bill of materials) files in formats such as SPDX or CycloneDX, build logs, test reports, or any related files or artifacts from your build process you'd like to keep organised.
Metadata artifacts can be uploaded and managed via the web interface and API, and we're rolling support out to our CI/CD integrations now.
Custom targets
We already provide a number of powerful ways to organise your builds - whether by target platform, stream, labels, or supported architectures.
Sometimes when it comes to target platform you might want to get more granular, or define your own targets. For example, maybe you're in the embedded space, and have firmware specific to each of your devices. Or, the platforms you're targeting are otherwise bespoke or obscure, and you'd like built in support to group builds beyond our built-in or "Generic" platform, or falling back another approach like labels.
All these use cases are now served by the ability to create your own custom "targets" within platforms.
Support for 42 more platforms, including embedded targets
We've just added built-in support for a ton more platforms.
You can now specifically target any major Linux distribution, additional enterprise Unix distros like HP-UX or IBM AIX, and new mobile platforms including Fitbit OS, Tizen, and HarmonyOS.
In the embedded space, we've added a wide array of popular RTOS like Zephyr, FreeRTOS, ThreadX, and many more.
Workspace labels
We've improved labels - which can now also be created at the Workspace level, and used across all your applications!
Existing application labels can be easily merged into workspace labels to promote them.
Default streams
Out of the box Buildstash creates some helpful default streams in all your new apps.
Sometimes you might wish to have your own default streams for any new apps you create, rather than having to manually customise them every time. Now, it's easy to do! Set stream details, including retention policies.
Improved enterprise single sign-on
We've added support for further enterprise SSO providers. Enterprise SSO support is available to teams on the Ultra and Enterprise plans - contact us if you'd like it enabled on your workspace.
Two-factor authentication
2FA is now available on all accounts. Go to your user settings to enable it today for improved security.

Thanks! We're going to share more blogs on some of our development processes, tooling, and how we've achieved some recent major feature rollouts in the near future.

More from Buildstash
Buildstash CEO and co-founder Robbie Cargill shared some thoughts on the history behind Visual Studio App Center, from its HockeyApp origins, as it closes today. Why it's a loss to many teams, and why Buildstash may be the replacement you're looking for.
