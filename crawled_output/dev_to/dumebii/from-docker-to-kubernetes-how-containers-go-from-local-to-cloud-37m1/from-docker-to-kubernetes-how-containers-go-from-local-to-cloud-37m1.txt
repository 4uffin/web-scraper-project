Understanding System Scaling With Kubernetes For Beginners

From Docker to Kubernetes: How Your Application Goes from Local to Cloud
Docker and Kubernetes are often mentioned together in modern software development—but they solve different problems. Docker makes it easy to package applications into containers. Kubernetes takes those containers and runs them at scale, across many servers, with reliability and automation.
Although my previous post on Docker and Kubernetes was part of an assignment, it got me thinking and curious about the DevOps space and about Docker and Kubernetes in general. Having used Docker previously, doing this research really broadened my understanding.
In this tutorial, we’ll:
Build a simple app using Docker.
Push the container image to Docker Hub (a registry).
Deploy the app on Kubernetes.
Scale it up and explore how Kubernetes manages it.
Along the way, I’ll explain each step, so you don’t just copy commands but actually understand what’s happening (this is feedback I got from a work with a client that said my article lacked technical depth and was just full of copy<=>paste code).
Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:
The latest version of Node.js
To verify, on your terminal, run:
node -v
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)
To verify, run:
docker --version
Kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
to Verify, run:
kubectl version --client
A Kubernetes cluster
Beginners can use Minikube (local cluster)
Or enable Kubernetes directly in Docker Desktop.
A Docker Hub account (free)
I like to think of Docker Hub as the GitHub for container images.
Creating a Simple Node.js Application
Create a Simple Node.js Application
We’ll create a Node.js app that returns a simple message.
Create a project folder:
mkdir docker-k8s-demo
cd docker-k8s-demo
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Inside the folder, create a file named app.js:
const http = require('http');
const port = 3000;
const requestHandler = (req, res) => {
res.end('Hello from Docker and Kubernetes!');
};
const server = http.createServer(requestHandler);
server.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Create a package.json file:
{
"name": "docker-k8s-demo",
"version": "1.0.0",
"main": "app.js",
"dependencies": {}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
At this point, we have a simple Node.js app.
Writing a Dockerfile file
Write a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is just a plain text file (no extension, usually named Dockerfile) that tells Docker how to build an image. It lives in the root of your project.
Create a file called Dockerfile:
# Start from the Node.js base image
FROM node:18-alpine
# Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Copy project files into container
COPY package*.json ./
COPY app.js ./
# Install dependencies
RUN npm install
# Expose the app’s port
EXPOSE 3000
# Start the app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Build the image:
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
-t myapp:1.0 → names the image myapp with version 1.0.
. means “use the Dockerfile in this directory.”
If this was run properly and successfully, you should see a success message like this on your terminal.
Running a Docker Container
Run the docker container:
docker run -p 3000:3000 myapp:1.0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Visit http://localhost:3000. You should see:
Hello from Docker and Kubernetes!
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How To Push An Image To Docker Hub
Pushing the Image to Docker Hub
Kubernetes won’t know about your local image—it needs to pull it from a registry.
Log in to Docker Hub:
docker login
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
A success message like this should be seen on your terminal
Tag your image with your Docker Hub username:
docker tag myapp:1.0 your-username/myapp:1.0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Push it:
docker push your-username/myapp:1.0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now your image is public in Docker Hub, ready for Kubernetes.
You are seeing "Layer already exists" in this screenshot because I had run this command once before but it failed at execution due to a lag in my internet.
Deploying Docker Containers on Kubernetes
A Kubernetes deployment needs a YAML file describing what to run.
Create deployment.yaml file:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: myapp-deployment
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: myapp
image: your-username/myapp:1.0
ports:
- containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: myapp-service
spec:
selector:
app: myapp
ports:
- protocol: TCP
port: 80
targetPort: 3000
type: LoadBalancer
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Apply it (run on your terminal):
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Check pods:
kubectl get pods
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
_This sample script creates three replicas. In the previous article, I explained what replicas are and how they relate to the problem of scaling. _
After running, you should see three pods running in your terminal window.
On your terminal, you should see three pods active and running.
Check service:
kubectl get service myapp-service
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
If using Docker Desktop or cloud Kubernetes, you’ll get an external IP.
If using Minikube:
minikube service myapp-service
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This opens the app in your browser.
Scaling An Application With Kubernetes
Scale the Application with Kubernetes
In the example above, we scaled to three replicas. As a system or application grows, more replicas or instances of it are needed to effectively scale up to the demand.
This can be done easily by running this command with the number of replicas you need per time.
kubectl scale deployment myapp-deployment --replicas=5
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Kubernetes will spin up two more pods automatically.
This workflow—build with Docker, deploy with Kubernetes—is the foundation of cloud-native applications. Docker ensures consistency across environments, and Kubernetes ensures reliability in production.
