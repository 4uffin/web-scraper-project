Beginner Dev Mistakes I Made (and What I‚Äôm Doing Differently Now)
#beginners
#learning
#devjournal
#webdev
Note:
Tips can be applied to any specialization, not only web dev.
When I started learning to code, I chose a web dev specialization. I thought the fastest way to ‚Äúbecome one‚Äù was to dive straight into all the flashy frameworks and tools. React, Tailwind, GSAP‚Äîyou name it, I tried it. The problem? I was rushing ahead without a solid foundation in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I‚Äôm sharing this because I know a lot of beginners go through the same struggles. Maybe you‚Äôre stuck in tutorial hell, chasing the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù roadmap, or comparing yourself to others. I‚Äôve been there, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned (and what I‚Äôm doing differently now).
üö© 1. Rushing Into Tools Without Foundations
I thought learning React right away would make me a ‚Äúreal developer.‚Äù But without knowing core web fundamentals, I was just copying code I didn‚Äôt fully understand.
What I‚Äôm doing now: I slowed down and committed to The Odin Project. It focuses on the basics before moving into advanced topics. That strong foundation gives you transferable skills‚Äîwhether you go into web dev, data, AI, or apps.
üö© 2. Getting Lost in Tutorial Hell
We‚Äôve all been there: jumping from one tutorial to another, copying projects, never finishing anything. It feels like progress, but it‚Äôs not.
What I‚Äôm doing now: I literally closed YouTube for a while. No more flashy thumbnails promising shortcuts. Instead, I focus on building projects on my own, even small ones. Struggling through mistakes teaches more than following along passively.
üö© 3. Waiting for the ‚ÄúPerfect Plan‚Äù
Another mistake: trying to find the best resource, the perfect roadmap, or the ‚Äúultimate way‚Äù to learn. I wasted more time researching than actually coding.
Lesson learned: There is no perfect plan. Just start. Pick one resource and stick with it. Momentum matters more than perfection. You‚Äôll adjust as you go.
üö© 4. Fighting Imposter Syndrome
Imposter syndrome is real. It whispers: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not good enough. You‚Äôll never catch up.‚Äù
What keeps me going: I remind myself that even senior developers are still learning. That‚Äôs the beauty of this field‚Äîlearning never stops. If you love what you‚Äôre doing, the results will show.
üí° Final Advice to Beginners
Enjoy the process.
Ask for help when you‚Äôre stuck.
Don‚Äôt wait for the perfect plan‚Äîjust start.
Pick one specialization (web, data, AI, cyber, apps).
Build a strong foundation in core skills before chasing frameworks.
The journey isn‚Äôt about racing to ‚Äúfull stack in 6 months.‚Äù It‚Äôs about loving what you build, embracing mistakes, and growing one step at a time.
üí¨ What about you? Have you been stuck in tutorial hell or jumped too fast into new tools? I‚Äôd love to hear your story in the comments.

Ah yes, tutorial hell‚Ä¶ I thought I was building projects, but really I was just collecting YouTube tabs like Pok√©mon cards. Now I‚Äôm slowly evolving into a real developer‚Äîstill missing a few core moves though

I'm just at the beginning of my journey and have decided to stick with free code camp to learn the basics. Currently getting through the HTML section and then it's onto CSS. When creating your own projects how do you get the ideas to get started?

Cool, I actually switch to fcc recently cause the odin project requires alot of reading. For projects I find it based on my goal and interests so for
example I love Badminton and would love to make a interactive site to display my favourite Badminton players. So look at your interest and check the awwwards site cause they have cool sites for inspiration.
Hope that helps

Oh but try not to force yourself to something you don't like but try to make it fun, try looking at other areas and you may find your passion so maybe cyber security or other fields.
If you need more help on what fields just ask me and I can list the popular ones or search in Google or chatgpt
Hope that helps

Momentum matters more than perfection.
Spot on.
Pick a North Star, and your path is only perfect after you reach the destination.

Master vanilla JS, HTML, CSS first. Build real projects, stick to one solid resource, and grind the basics. Momentum beats the ‚Äúperfect plan‚Äù.
