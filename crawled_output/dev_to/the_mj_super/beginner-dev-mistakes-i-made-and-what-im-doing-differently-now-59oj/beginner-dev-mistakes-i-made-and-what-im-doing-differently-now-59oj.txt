Beginner Dev Mistakes I Made (and What I’m Doing Differently Now)
#beginners
#learning
#devjournal

Note:
Tips can be applied to any specialization, not only web dev.
When I started learning to code, I chose a web dev specialization. I thought the fastest way to “become one” was to dive straight into all the flashy frameworks and tools. React, Tailwind, GSAP—you name it, I tried it. The problem? I was rushing ahead without a solid foundation in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I’m sharing this because I know a lot of beginners go through the same struggles. Maybe you’re stuck in tutorial hell, chasing the “perfect” roadmap, or comparing yourself to others. I’ve been there, and here’s what I’ve learned (and what I’m doing differently now).
🚩 1. Rushing Into Tools Without Foundations
I thought learning React right away would make me a “real developer.” But without knowing core web fundamentals, I was just copying code I didn’t fully understand.
What I’m doing now: I slowed down and committed to The Odin Project. It focuses on the basics before moving into advanced topics. That strong foundation gives you transferable skills—whether you go into web dev, data, AI, or apps.
🚩 2. Getting Lost in Tutorial Hell
We’ve all been there: jumping from one tutorial to another, copying projects, never finishing anything. It feels like progress, but it’s not.
What I’m doing now: I literally closed YouTube for a while. No more flashy thumbnails promising shortcuts. Instead, I focus on building projects on my own, even small ones. Struggling through mistakes teaches more than following along passively.
🚩 3. Waiting for the “Perfect Plan”
Another mistake: trying to find the best resource, the perfect roadmap, or the “ultimate way” to learn. I wasted more time researching than actually coding.
Lesson learned: There is no perfect plan. Just start. Pick one resource and stick with it. Momentum matters more than perfection. You’ll adjust as you go.
🚩 4. Fighting Imposter Syndrome
Imposter syndrome is real. It whispers: “You’re not good enough. You’ll never catch up.”
What keeps me going: I remind myself that even senior developers are still learning. That’s the beauty of this field—learning never stops. If you love what you’re doing, the results will show.
💡 Final Advice to Beginners
Enjoy the process.
Ask for help when you’re stuck.
Don’t wait for the perfect plan—just start.
Pick one specialization (web, data, AI, cyber, apps).
Build a strong foundation in core skills before chasing frameworks.
The journey isn’t about racing to “full stack in 6 months.” It’s about loving what you build, embracing mistakes, and growing one step at a time.
💬 What about you? Have you been stuck in tutorial hell or jumped too fast into new tools? I’d love to hear your story in the comments.

Ah yes, tutorial hell… I thought I was building projects, but really I was just collecting YouTube tabs like Pokémon cards. Now I’m slowly evolving into a real developer—still missing a few core moves though
