Learning Principles to Help You Learn Faster and Smarter if You Want to Become a Dev in the AI Age

We’re living in the AI age. Information is growing at exponential speed, and the ability to learn faster, adapt faster, and retain more knowledge can set you apart as a software developer.
But here’s the catch—most people still study wrong.
If you’ve been:
rereading textbooks 📚
rewatching tutorials ▶️
highlighting notes in rainbow colors 🌈
rewriting notes just to make them look aesthetic…
I hate to break it to you—those are passive study methods. They drain your time and energy without bringing you closer to becoming an effective developer.
In this guide, we’ll rewire your learning strategy using principles I’ve picked up from:
Ultra Learning (Scott H. Young)
Atomic Habits (James Clear)
The Only Study Guide You’ll Ever Need (UnJaded Jade)
Ali Abdaal & other YouTube creators
So you can learn deeply, retain concepts long-term, and apply them in real coding scenarios.
🔪 Stop Comparing Study Hours
We’ve all met someone who proudly says:
“I studied for 10 hours yesterday.”
But then they get the same—or worse—results as you.
That’s because time spent ≠ knowledge gained.
Think of it like this:
Lumberjack A chops trees with a dull axe → lots of effort, little progress.
Lumberjack B sharpens his axe first → then cuts through trees with ease.
💡 Be like Lumberjack B. Don’t obsess over marathon hours. Sharpen your tools first.
And remember: learning is personal. Comparing your hours to others only creates guilt and burnout.
⚙️ Systems > Goals
Most beginners say:
“I want to be the top developer.”
That’s a goal. But here’s the truth:
Goals don’t get results—systems do.
From James Clear’s Atomic Habits:
Goal: “I want to get fit.”
System: Go to the gym 3x a week, increase weights, track sleep and food.
For developers:
Goal: “I want to learn data structures.”
System: Solve 3 coding challenges daily, explain 1 concept weekly, review mistakes.
🚀 Build systems that make progress inevitable. The results will follow.
🧩 The SAAD Framework (Jade Bowler’s Method)
From The Only Study Guide You’ll Ever Need:
Spaced Repetition → Review concepts at intervals (syntax, algorithms, formulas).
Active Recall → Quiz yourself. Use flashcards, LeetCode, or explain from memory.
Association → Link abstract concepts with analogies. (Recursion = Russian nesting dolls).
Desirable Difficulty → Practice just beyond your comfort zone. Hard enough to stretch, not so hard you quit.
🛠 Proven Study Methods for Developers
Feynman Technique → Teach a concept like you’re explaining it to a child—or your rubber duck.
Blurting → Close notes, write everything you recall, then check gaps.
Past Paper & Project Work → Stop hoarding tutorials. Build small apps and code from scratch.
⏳ Optimizing Your Time
Parkinson’s Law → Work expands to fill the time you allow. Set shorter deadlines.
Eat the Frog → Do your hardest task first (debugging, tough algorithms).
Retrospective Timetables (Ali Abdaal) → Track what you actually studied, not what you planned.
Use color codes: 🔴 red (weak), 🟡 yellow (okay), 🟢 green (confident).
⏱ Use time as a tool, not a trap.
🧠 Memory Tricks That Work
Memory Palace → Place coding concepts in familiar locations. (Recursion in the fridge = keeps repeating).
Mnemonics & Acronyms → Example: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Imagery & Storytelling → Turn abstract concepts into vivid images.
🎯 Deep Work vs Pomodoro
Pomodoro (25-min sprints) → Great for getting started.
Deep Work (90+ mins) → Where breakthroughs happen.
💡 Reward wisely. Don’t break focus to scroll TikTok—stretch, snack, or walk instead.
💥 When You Fail (And You Will)
You’ll bomb coding challenges. Misread algorithms. Sometimes even AI will outshine you. That’s normal.
Failure = data.
Keep a bug journal or wrong answers list. Review, adapt, grow.
🏀 Michael Jordan missed thousands of shots. That’s why he succeeded.
🐢 Dealing with Procrastination
Procrastination isn’t always laziness. Often it’s because:
You’re avoiding discomfort.
You’re overwhelmed and don’t know where to start 🥺
Hacks:
Make tomorrow easy. Start with something tiny (“Open VS Code. Write a few lines.”). 1% daily > 0%.
Allow a 10-min procrastination window. Promise yourself you’ll start after.
Beware of “productive procrastination.” Watching coding videos ≠ coding.
✅ Quick Recap: 5 AI-Age Learning Principles
Active Recall > Passive Review → Test, don’t just reread.
Systems > Goals → Build habits, not wish lists.
Spaced Repetition → Don’t cram—revisit over time.
Deep Work > Multitasking → Focus is your superpower.
Failure = Feedback → Mistakes are growth signals.
🌟 Final Thoughts
Learning software development in 2025 isn’t just about Python, React, or AI tools.
It’s about building the right mindset and systems to outpace the flood of information.
Sharpen your study habits now, and you’ll slice through challenges later—like a sharp axe through butter. 🪓🧈

These are good leaning strategies. Especially active recall and having a system, there's no way you can keep doing something consistently if there's no system in place
