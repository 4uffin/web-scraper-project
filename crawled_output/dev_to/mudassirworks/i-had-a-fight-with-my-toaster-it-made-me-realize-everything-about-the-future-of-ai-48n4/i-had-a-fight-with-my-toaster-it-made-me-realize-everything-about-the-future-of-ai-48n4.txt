I Had a Fight With My Toaster. It Made Me Realize Everything About the Future of AI.

It was 7 AM. The coffee was brewing, the sun was streaming in, and I was arguing with a toaster.
You had one job, I mumbled, scraping the blackened edges of my toast into the sink. The toaster, a "smart" one, was supposed to know my preferences. Yet, here we were. This little gadget, a tiny island of supposed intelligence, was completely disconnected from the rest of my morning. It didn't know I was running late. It didn't know the coffee machine had just finished a dark roast, which pairs terribly with burnt bread. It just knew toast.
This frustratingly common experience is a symptom of a larger problem. We've built millions of "smart" things, but they're not wise. They're isolated, they follow rigid rules, and they don't talk to each other.
But what if they did? What if we're on the verge of a world that isn't just smart, but truly alive? I recently stumbled upon a vision for the future that gave this idea a name: Agentia World.
From Rigid Commands to Living Conversations
Before we dive in, let's talk about how things work now. Almost every digital interaction you have is governed by APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Think of an API as a strict restaurant menu. You can order item #3 with a side of #B, and the kitchen knows exactly what to do. It's efficient, but rigid. You can't say, "I'm feeling something light and spicy today." The system doesn't understand intent.
Agentia World imagines a future that scraps this menu. Instead, our devices‚Äîour "agents"‚Äîwill have intelligent dialogues.
Imagine your car agent talking to your home agent. It wouldn't send a rigid API call like home.gate.open(). It would have a conversation:
Car Agent: "Hey, I'm about five minutes away with the owner. It's been a long day."
Home Agent: "Understood. Preparing for arrival. I'll open the garage, turn on the hallway lights, and start the evening focus playlist on the speakers."
This isn't just a command; it's a collaborative exchange based on understanding the goal. The home doesn't just obey; it anticipates.
A World Where Everything is an Agent
This is where the vision gets really wild. It proposes that everything becomes an AI agent. Not just your phone and your car, but the mundane, everyday objects.
Your coffee machine becomes a personal barista, checking your calendar for early meetings and your health tracker for your caffeine limits.
Your houseplants have agents that negotiate with the window blinds for the perfect amount of sunlight.
An entire city becomes a macro-agent. The traffic light agents talk to public transport agents, which talk to the power grid agents, all working in a seamless, living network to eliminate traffic jams and save energy.
This creates a living network that's constantly learning and adapting. It's a system that's both digital (the AI making decisions) and physical (the agents controlling real-world objects).
So, What Does This Mean for Us?
For the average person, it means a world that simply works. A world where the technology disappears into the background, seamlessly orchestrating our lives for the better. The constant micro-management of our digital lives fades away.
For us developers, it represents the next frontier. We'll move from building isolated apps and services to designing collaborative agents that can negotiate, learn, and act within a massive, decentralized ecosystem. The challenge will shift from writing rigid code to teaching intelligent systems.
The fight with my toaster was a reminder of how far we still have to go. We don't just need smarter devices; we need a wiser world. And that's the promise of a future where everything, from our toasters to our cities, is part of one intelligent, living conversation.

It's inaccurate to say this will "scrap" APIs.
An API is just a set of functions that do what they're designed to do.
What you're talking about is adding layers of abstraction over the more basic functions.
The functions will still be there in the code and still be useful to whatever calls into them.
If your point is that AI is unintelligent, that's true.
I stayed in a hotel in which a bright light is automatically turned on when someone enters the bathroom.
It's annoying to be hit with a blinding light at 3am when my eyes aren't adjusted to light.
The only solution was to cover the motion sensor with a towel.
In this case, low-tech 1, A.I. 0.
