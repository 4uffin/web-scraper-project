Thanks to the efforts of JoÃ£o Lopes we now have the third Community Soundtrack up on Bandcamp already, so you can listen to some fine music from this yearâ€™s entries.
Itâ€™s the third year JoÃ£o is collecting the tracks, and all three albums are available to be listended for free on a dedicated Bandcamp account:
js13kGames 2023 Community Soundtrack
Triskaidekaphobia - JS13k 2024
13K Cat Bites (2025)
The best games all have something in common: great soundtracks. But Iâ€™m sure I donâ€™t need to tell you that great game soundtracks donâ€™t need big budget philharmonic compositions to be fun experiences. In fact, many fun games have simple tunes created in JavaScript using a myriad of tools, or even programmed by hand directly using the Web Audio API.
Add your music
You can still add music to our album from your own entries if you want to - join our Slack server and visit the #soundtrack channel to drop the tunes and their corresponding image, so JoÃ£o can add it. We already have 7 tracks, but thereâ€™s plenty of room for more!
