Farsi Image generator
#pillow

During the development of a personal project, I needed to build a script that converts Farsi (Persian) text into an image. To make the process easier â€” and a bit more fun â€” I chose the excellent Gradio framework to build a simple interactive interface.
What is Gradio?
Gradio is a popular open-source Python library that makes it easy to create interactive, web-based UIs for machine learning models, APIs, or even plain Python functions. Itâ€™s a favorite among data scientists and ML engineers who want to quickly share their work â€” no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript required.
Gradio also has a new serverless option, Gradio-Lite, which is amazing for quick demos, but unfortunately itâ€™s not suitable for this project.
Installing Gradio
I prefer using uv as my package manager since itâ€™s blazing fast (thanks to Rust under the hood):
uv add gradio
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Installing libraqm
Farsi uses a complex script where the shape of each character depends on its position in the word. To render it correctly, we need libraqm, which handles text shaping.
Hereâ€™s how to install it:
macOS
Using Homebrew:
brew install libraqm
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
If youâ€™re using fish shell, youâ€™ll also need to update your PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
set -gx PKG_CONFIG_PATH "(brew --prefix libraqm)/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Windows
Follow this StackOverflow answer for installation instructions.
Installing Pillow
Once libraqm is set up, install Pillow with:
uv pip install Pillow --no-binary=Pillow
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This ensures Pillow is compiled with libraqm support.
Converting Farsi Text to an Image
Now that everything is installed, we can write a simple script that takes:
A font file
Your Farsi text
Image dimensions
Hereâ€™s the script:
Run the script, then open your app at:
http://localhost:8007/
Hereâ€™s the result ðŸŽ‰

I am trying to create an ocr for Farsi language which could have a sophisticated results with old Persian texts. Here I've shared a small tool on this journey with you. Please share your thoughts. I'm very interested in to find a team worker on this ;)
