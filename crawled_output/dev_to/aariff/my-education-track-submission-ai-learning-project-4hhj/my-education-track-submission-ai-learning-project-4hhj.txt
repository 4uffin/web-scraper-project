Education Track: Build Apps with Google AI Studio
What I Built
I built an AI Logo Generator in Google AI Studio using Gemini image generation. The app takes a business name plus style keywords (e.g., minimalist, modern, vintage) and produces a highâ€‘quality 1024px logo in seconds.
Core functionality:
â€¢ Single prompt form (business name + style)
â€¢ Generates one consistent logo per request with guided composition and palette
â€¢ Supports style controls like flat/vector-like, centered icon, palette constraints
Target audience:
â€¢ Founders, students, and indie builders who need fast brand visuals
â€¢ Hackathon and class projects that require quick logo concepts
â€¢ Non-designers who want repeatable, onâ€‘brand results
Unique features:
â€¢ Opinionated prompt patterns for predictable layout and contrast
â€¢ New Zealandâ€“inspired examples (Kiwi Cloud Shield, Te Aro Coffee Co., TuiTech)
â€¢ Shareable AI Studio app link for instant trials without setup
How it works
â€¢ Built in Google AI Studio using Gemini image generation
â€¢ Input: business name + style keywords (e.g., minimalist, modern, vintage)
â€¢ Generates one 1024px logo per request with guided composition/palette
â€¢ Style keywords like "flat", "vector-like", "centered icon" improve consistency
â€¢ Shareable app link for instant trials, no local setup required
Demo
Prompt: [Modern logo for 'WellySec Labs' using neon green on black, cyber-shield icon, flat, vector-like, centered.]
Caption: [A clean, high-contrast cyber-shield identity with neon accents on black for a modern security brand]
Prompt: [Vintage badge logo for 'Te Aro Coffee Co.' hand-drawn style, circular badge, warm browns and cream, textured]
Caption: [A textured, hand-drawn circular badge evoking classic roastery vibes in warm, coffee-toned hues]
Prompt: [Playful mascot logo for 'TuiTech' in cartoon style, tui bird with circuit accents, bright blue/teal, white background.]
Caption: [A cheerful tui-mascot with subtle circuit motifs delivering a friendly, tech-forward brand feel.]
My Experience
Learning Journey
[I explored Google AI Studio end to end, from starting a prompt-based app to sharing a deployable link. The biggest unlock was learning how prompt structure drives composition in image generation: adding style keywords like "flat," "vector-like," "centered icon," and a 2â€“3 color palette produced more consistent, logo-ready results.
I iterated on several brand concepts (security, coffee, and a playful tech mascot) to test how the model responds to tone, palette, and symmetry constraints. I found that shorter, highly specific prompts outperformed long descriptive ones for logos.
Challenges included occasional color drift and over-detailed renders. I mitigated these by explicitly constraining palette (e.g., "green/black palette"), layout ("centered icon"), and finish ("high contrast, minimalist").
Overall, AI Studio's guided flow made it fast to go from idea to usable outputs, and the shareable app link helped validate results quickly.]
Technical Implementation
[Platform: Google AI Studio with Gemini image generation.
App flow: Single input form that accepts business name + style keywords, forwards the composed prompt to the image generation endpoint, and returns a single 1024px image per request.
Prompt engineering: Opinionated template enforcing composition and palette, e.g., "[style] logo for '[Business Name]', [palette], [flat/vector-like], centered icon, high contrast."
Consistency controls:
Composition: "centered icon," "flat," "vector-like"
Palette: 2â€“3 colors (e.g., neon green/black, warm browns/cream, bright blue/teal)
Output size: 1024px for clarity in posts and thumbnails
Deployment/share: Used AI Studio's app share link so reviewers can try it without local setup. Kept API keys out of code and relied on the built-in share/preview.
Tooling: AI Studio app scaffolding, prompt template logic, and basic UI components for input and render.]
Key Takeaways
[Prompt specificity beats verbosity: precise layout and palette constraints yield cleaner, brand-appropriate logos.
Style keywords are levers: "flat," "vector-like," and "high contrast" noticeably improve logo suitability.
Small palettes = better legibility: limiting to 2â€“3 colors helps avoid muddy results and improves consistency across generations.
Fast iteration matters: generating multiple variants and locking in what works (layout + palette) saves time and reduces randomness.]
