Qwen Code Just Got Smarter: Key Features in v0.0.10 & v0.0.11
#webdev

#ai
AI-powered coding assistants have been reshaping developer workflows for the past few years. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codeium help programmers write, debug, and understand code faster than ever. But while most of these solutions are closed-source and tied to proprietary ecosystems, Qwen Code, an open-source project from Alibaba’s Qwen team, is carving out a different path.
With its latest updates  versions v0.0.10 and v0.0.11  Qwen Code introduces a batch of improvements designed to make the development experience smoother, smarter, and more productive. From better memory handling to task decomposition via subagents, these features show that Qwen Code isn’t just catching up with competitors  it’s innovating in its own way.
In this article, I’ll break down the most important updates, explain why they matter, and explore how developers can take advantage of them in real-world projects.
Why Qwen Code Matters in 2025
Before we dive into the features, let’s talk about why this project stands out.
Open source advantage: Unlike Copilot or ChatGPT’s coding integrations, Qwen Code is fully open-source, giving developers more control and transparency. You can fork, customize, or even self-host it for privacy-conscious environments.
Local-first mindset: Many teams today want tools that don’t always rely on cloud APIs. Qwen Code allows for flexible integration, including local deployments where data privacy is critical.
Part of a bigger ecosystem: The Qwen models are evolving fast. Qwen Code benefits from the same innovations powering the broader Qwen family of large language models.
In short: if you’re looking for a developer assistant that doesn’t lock you in and still evolves quickly, Qwen Code deserves your attention.
New UX & Productivity Features
The most exciting updates in v0.0.10 and v0.0.11 fall under productivity and user experience. Here’s what’s new:
1. Subagents for Smarter Task Decomposition
Instead of one large agent trying to solve everything at once, Qwen Code now supports subagents smaller specialized agents that can tackle parts of a task.
For example:
One subagent could focus on database schema changes.
Another could update API endpoints.
A third could adjust frontend components.
This is powerful for complex workflows like full-stack feature development, where breaking things down reduces mistakes and increases clarity.
Real-world benefit: Imagine adding a new “wishlist” feature in an e-commerce app. Subagents could coordinate backend model changes, write frontend UI code, and even suggest documentation updates  without stepping on each other’s toes.
2. Todo Write Tool for Task Tracking
Another major addition is the Todo Write tool, which integrates task management directly into your coding session. Instead of juggling sticky notes, Trello boards, or external to-do lists, you can now keep track of tasks inside Qwen Code.
Example workflow:
When tasks are checked off, Qwen Code can adjust its suggestions and context. This helps keep your work focused and aligned with your goals.
3. “Welcome Back” Project Summary
Ever reopen a project after a week and forget where you left off? Qwen Code now greets you with a “Welcome Back” summary when reopening. It highlights:
What files you were last editing
Pending tasks from your Todo list
Context of recent changes
This is a quality-of-life feature that saves time and mental load, especially when working on side projects you revisit occasionally.
4. Customizable Cache Strategy
Caching is critical for performance, but not all projects benefit from the same approach. Qwen Code now lets you customize cache strategies  for example, prioritizing speed in a small app or memory efficiency in a large monorepo.
Performance & Developer Experience Improvements
Alongside productivity upgrades, v0.0.10 & v0.0.11 bring several behind-the-scenes optimizations:
Smoother editing: Eliminates frustrating agent loops where the AI would get stuck repeating edits.
Built-in Terminal Bench stress testing: Developers can now stress test environments directly, useful for benchmarking new services.
Fewer retries & better login handling: Fewer interruptions, especially in multi-session workflows.
Optimized file reading for big projects: Improved handling of large repos with thousands of files.
Enhanced IDE & shell integration: Better compatibility with popular development environments.
Better MCP & OAuth support: More robust authentication and plugin flexibility.
Improved memory/session management: Helps keep longer conversations coherent, so the AI “remembers” context better.
Updated multilingual docs: Expanding support for global dev teams.
Why this matters: If you’ve ever worked in a massive repo and waited forever for your coding agent to parse files, you’ll immediately appreciate these performance boosts.
Keeping docs updated is always a pain. That’s where Deepdocs, a GitHub-native app, comes in. It syncs your code and documentation automatically  so when Qwen Code helps you refactor or add features, your docs don’t fall behind. Perfect combo for staying productive.
Why Developers Should Care
So what’s the big picture here?
Faster onboarding: New contributors to a project can use “Welcome Back” summaries and Todos to quickly understand priorities.
Better collaboration: Subagents can handle different layers of the stack, reducing conflicts.
Open source advantage: You aren’t limited by a commercial vendor’s roadmap — you can adapt Qwen Code to your team’s needs.
Improved stability: With smoother editing and optimized file handling, day-to-day frustrations drop significantly.
Final Thoughts
AI developer tools are moving fast, but not all of them give you freedom. Qwen Code stands out because it’s open-source, flexible, and evolving rapidly.
With subagents, task tracking, “Welcome Back” summaries, cache strategies, and performance boosts, versions v0.0.10 and v0.0.11 show a clear direction: making AI coding assistants practical, reliable, and developer-friendly.
And when paired with tools like Deepdocs, the experience goes beyond just writing code  it creates a workflow where your project’s code and documentation stay in sync effortlessly.
So whether you’re a solo developer hacking on a weekend project or part of a team working in a massive repo, Qwen Code is worth trying. You’ll find yourself spending less time wrestling with your AI assistant and more time actually building.

This Todo Write tool sounds interesting. Has anyone tried it in a real project yet? Wondering if it’s actually useful beyond demos.

I tested it last night. it’s basically like having a little scratchpad inside Qwen. Not perfect, but it kept me from jumping back and forth to Notion.

Subagents splitting tasks is honestly the killer feature. Cursor feels clunky with larger projects, curious to see if Qwen handles it better.
