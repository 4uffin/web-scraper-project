Video walkthrough: My neighbourhood adventure
What I Built
At its heart, Isekai Chronicles is an attempt to answer a simple question:
What if your walk to the corner store was an epic quest? What if the local park was a haunted forest, and the library a repository of ancient lore?
I built this app to solve the problem of static, predictable game worlds. It creates a deeply personal and endlessly replayable text-based RPG by transmuting the player's real-world surroundings into a high-fantasy adventure.
This isn't just a game; it's a generative world engine. Every adventure is unique, woven from the fabric of your own neighborhood and brought to life by a suite of AI-powered tools.
Core Features:
Real-World to Fantasy World
Using your device's geolocation, the app identifies nearby parks, landmarks, and points of interest, using them as the seed to generate a bespoke fantasy setting.
AI Storyteller & Dungeon Master
The narrative is driven by a dynamic AI that writes the story, describes fantastical scenes, invents deep lore on the fly, and presents meaningful choices that shape your journey.
AI Illustrator
Every location, character, and item is visualized with a unique, AI-generated image in a consistent *hand-drawn fantasy ink* style. The world isn't just described; it's sketched out before your eyes.
Cinematic Combat
Enemies don't spawn on a boring battle screen. Instead, the AI dynamically edits the current scene, adding foes and altering your character's pose to create a seamless, confrontational tableau.
On-the-Fly Artistry
Loot items like a *Runic Key* or a *Shimmering Health Potion* are instantly given custom inventory icons by the AI artisan.
Voice-Powered Immersion
Speak your commands directly to the game. The AI listens, transcribes, and advances the story, making the experience more accessible and immersive.
The Adventurers' Archive
At the end of your quest, save your story to a global archive for other players to discover.
Shared World Map
Opt-in to place a pin on the World Map, showing the approximate (privacy-safe) region of your tale, creating a tapestry of shared adventures.
Physical Memento
Download every completed adventure as a beautifully formatted PDF ‚Äî a true *chronicle* of your personal journey.
How I Used Google AI Studio
Google's Gemini models are the heart, soul, and imagination of this project. I treated each capability like a specialized member of a creative team.
gemini-2.5-flash ‚Äî The Dungeon Master
Creative Writing: Initial story, branching choices, combat sequences.
Structured Data Generation: Returns clean JSON with game state (choices, loot, enemy stats, lore).
Audio Transcription: Converts spoken commands into text.
Auxiliary Content: Generates fantasy-style regional names for the World Map.
gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview ‚Äî The Master Illustrator
Generates 16:9 landscape scenes.
Handles narrative-driven edits, e.g., adding enemies during combat.
Central to the cinematic combat system.
imagen-4.0-generate-001 ‚Äî The Artisan
Produces high-quality 1:1 assets where detail matters.
Creates the player‚Äôs character silhouette and custom inventory icons.
Orchestration: A single player choice may trigger:
Story text from gemini-2.5-flash.
Scene edits via gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview.
Item icon creation via imagen-4.0-generate-001.
Multimodal Features
The magic of Isekai Chronicles comes from seamless blending of text, images, and audio ‚Äî each in conversation with the others.
Text-to-Image ‚Äî Visualizing the Narrative
Example:
Storyteller describes a ‚ÄúSun-drenched plaza with a cracked marble statue.‚Äù
This description is passed to the Illustrator, producing a matching visual scene.
Result: Perfect cohesion between what you read and what you see.
Image-and-Text-to-Image ‚Äî Cinematic Combat Editing
Example:
Current scene + instruction: ‚ÄúAdd a menacing Stone Golem, and change the character‚Äôs pose to be confrontational.‚Äù
The Illustrator modifies the existing image instead of replacing it.
Result: A fluid, cinematic transition from exploration to combat.
Audio-to-Text ‚Äî Speaking Your Reality
Player speaks into the mic.
Audio is base64-encoded and sent to gemini-2.5-flash.
Model transcribes it into a clean command (e.g., ‚ÄúExamine the glowing runes‚Äù).
Result: Interaction feels natural ‚Äî less like clicking buttons, more like speaking your will into existence.
That's Isekai Adventures for you!
