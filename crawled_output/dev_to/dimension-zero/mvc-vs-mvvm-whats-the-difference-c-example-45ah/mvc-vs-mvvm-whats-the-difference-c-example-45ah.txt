MVC vs MVVM: what's the difference? (C# example)
#mvc
#mvvm
#architecture
#ui
When developing web or desktop applications, you'll encounter two fundamental architectural patterns: MVC (Model-View-Controller) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
This article aims to help understand their differences, strengths and appropriate use cases in order to make informed architectural decisions.
The Name-Flow Mismatch Problem
The first point to deal with is the potential for confusion: both of the MVC and MVVM acronyms describe components rather than data flow.
The actual runtime behavior differs significantly from what the names suggest.
A Mental Model: ICMV and IVVMM
To better understand these patterns, consider thinking about them in terms of data flow rather than components:
MVC as ICMV:
Input (user action/request)
Controller (processes input)
Model (updates data)
View (displays result)
Flow is Input → Controller → Model → View hence ICMV.
MVVM as IVVMM:
Input (user interaction in View)
View (captures input)
View Model (processes and transforms)
Model (persists data)
Flow is Input → View ↔ View Model ↔ Model hence IVVMM.
Bidirectional ↔ flows are managed automatically with "data binding".
These mnemonics help clarify the execution flow, though keep in mind that real implementations are more nuanced than these linear representations suggest.
Beyond the Basics: Real-World Flows
The ICMV and IVVMM mnemonics are simplified starting points in how to think about and use MVC and MVVM. In production applications, both patterns support multiple sophisticated flow variations:
MVC includes flows through routers, middleware, service layers, validation pipelines, WebSockets and async operations. These flows remain fundamentally sequential and request-driven.
MVVM encompasses command patterns, multi-ViewModel communication, converters, validation feedback loops and external event flows. These flows are inherently reactive and bidirectional, often running simultaneously.
The key distinction isn't the number of possible flows, but their nature: MVC orchestrates sequential request/response cycles, while MVVM manages reactive, bidirectional data synchronization.
For an exploration of these flow patterns with detailed examples, see the 5-part follow-up article: MVC vs MVVM: Deep Dive into Real-World Flow Patterns
MVC: Multiple Valid Interpretations
MVC has evolved since its Smalltalk origins. Modern implementations vary, meaning there is no one MVC:
Traditional Desktop MVC:
User Input → Controller
Controller updates → Model
Model notifies → View (via observer pattern)
View can read Model directly
Web Framework MVC (ASP.NET MVC, Spring MVC):
HTTP Request → Controller
Controller processes business logic, updates Model
Controller selects View and passes Model
Framework renders View with Model data
Response sent to client
Key insight: In web MVC, the framework handles view updates automatically through its rendering pipeline; Controllers don't manually push data to Views.
Practical MVC Example (Web Context)
Here's a small but realistic MVC example showing automatic view rendering:
// Model
public class Person
{
public int Id { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public string Email { get; set; }
}
// Controller (ASP.NET MVC style)
public class PersonController : Controller
{
private readonly IPersonRepository _repository;
public PersonController(IPersonRepository repository)
{
_repository = repository;
}
// GET: /Person/Edit/5
public ActionResult Edit(int id)
{
var person = _repository.GetById(id);
return View(person); // Framework handles view rendering
}
// POST: /Person/Edit/5
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Edit(Person person)
{
if (ModelState.IsValid)
{
_repository.Update(person);
return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
return View(person); // Re-render with validation errors
}
}
// View (Razor syntax) - EditPerson.cshtml
@model Person
@using (Html.BeginForm())
{
@Html.EditorFor(m => m.Name)
@Html.EditorFor(m => m.Email)
<button type="submit">Save</button>
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Notice how the Controller doesn't explicitly update the View.
The framework manages this through its rendering pipeline.
MVVM: Bidirectional by Design
MVVM establishes bidirectional data flow from the start:
View ↔ ViewModel (via data binding)
ViewModel ↔ Model (via property updates)
User interactions originate in the View, flow to the ViewModel through bindings and changes propagate back automatically. The View is both input source and output destination.
MVVM Example (WPF)
// Model
public class Person
{
public string Name { get; set; } = "";
public string Email { get; set; } = "";
}
// ViewModel
public class PersonViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
private readonly Person _model;
private string _name;
private string _email;
public PersonViewModel(Person model)
{
_model = model;
_name = model.Name;
_email = model.Email;
}
public string Name
{
get => _name;
set
{
if (_name == value) return;
_name = value;
_model.Name = value;
OnPropertyChanged();
OnPropertyChanged(nameof(DisplayText)); // Dependent property
}
}
public string Email
{
get => _email;
set
{
if (_email == value) return;
_email = value;
_model.Email = value;
OnPropertyChanged();
}
}
public string DisplayText => $"{Name} ({Email})";
public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
private void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string p = null)
=> PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(p));
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
<!-- View (XAML) -->
<StackPanel>
<TextBox Text="{Binding Name, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"/>
<TextBox Text="{Binding Email}"/>
<TextBlock Text="{Binding DisplayText}"/>
</StackPanel>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
When to Use Each Pattern
MVC Excels At:
Server-Side Web Applications
Natural fit for HTTP request/response cycle
Built-in routing and middleware support
Efficient server-side rendering
Clear separation between API and presentation logic
RESTful APIs
Controllers map cleanly to resource endpoints
Stateless request handling
Simple CRUD operations with straightforward flow
Scenarios with Simple State Management
Form submissions
Database-driven applications
Content management systems
Applications where most logic lives on the server
MVVM Excels At:
Rich Desktop Applications
Complex UI with multiple interdependent controls
Real-time updates across multiple views
Applications requiring offline capability
Data-Driven UIs
Dashboards with live data
Complex forms with validation
Master-detail interfaces
Applications with heavy client-side state
Cross-Platform Development (with caveats)
Shared ViewModels across different UI technologies
Note: Requires compatible binding frameworks on all platforms
Trade-offs and Considerations
Testing
MVC:
Controllers are testable with dependency injection
View testing often requires integration tests
Clear boundaries make unit testing straightforward
Request/response model simplifies test scenarios
MVVM:
ViewModels are highly testable in isolation
Property change notifications can be verified
However, binding behavior itself requires UI tests
Complex ViewModels with interdependent properties can become difficult to test thoroughly
Performance
MVC:
Minimal client-side overhead
Server bears computational load
Network latency affects responsiveness
Excellent for high-traffic scenarios with caching
MVVM:
Data binding introduces memory overhead
Complex binding expressions can impact performance
Client-side processing reduces server load
Better perceived performance for interactive UIs
Complexity
MVC:
Simpler conceptual model
Explicit control flow is easier to debug
Less "magic" happening behind the scenes
Manual view updates can become repetitive
MVVM:
Steeper learning curve
Binding errors can be difficult to debug
Automatic updates reduce boilerplate
Can lead to over-engineering for simple scenarios
Modern Variations and Hybrid Approaches
The distinction between MVC and MVVM has blurred in modern frameworks:
MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
Middle ground between MVC and MVVM
Presenter handles all UI logic and view updates
View is completely passive
Popular in Android development
Component-Based Architectures
React with Redux: Unidirectional data flow with centralized state
Angular: Combines elements of MVC and MVVM with dependency injection
Vue.js: Reactive data binding with component composition
Flux/Redux Pattern
Unidirectional data flow
Centralized state management
Actions → Dispatcher → Store → View
Predictable state updates
Practical Guidelines
Choose MVC when:
Building server-rendered web applications
Creating RESTful APIs
Working with simple CRUD operations
Team is more familiar with request/response model
Choose MVVM when:
Building rich desktop applications
Developing complex, stateful UIs
Working with frameworks that provide robust data binding
Need to share business logic across platforms
Consider hybrid approaches when:
Building modern SPAs
Need both server and client capabilities
Working with microservices architecture
Requirements include real-time updates
Summary
MVC and MVVM are both valuable patterns, each with distinct advantages:
MVC provides a straightforward, request-driven architecture ideal for server-side applications and APIs
MVVM offers powerful data binding and state management for rich, interactive client applications
Rather than viewing one as superior, consider that each pattern evolved to solve different problems. MVC flourished for web development, while MVVM emerged from rich client application requirements. Choose based on your specific context: platform capabilities, team expertise, performance requirements and application complexity.
Modern frameworks increasingly blend these patterns, offering flexibility to use the right approach for each part of your application. Understanding the fundamental principles of both patterns enables you to make informed decisions and leverage hybrid approaches effectively.
Our next article takes a rigorous look into how to use MVC and MVVM in practice, in five parts: MVC vs MVVM: Deep Dive into Real-World Flow Patterns - Part 1.
POSTSCRIPT
For those old enough to remember the noise that AJAX made when it burst onto the scene in 2005, there is a useful historical analogy.
Classic Web 1.0 (full page submits and reloads) maps neatly to MVC: an explicit, controller-driven request/response cycle. Every click triggered a round trip, the controller processed the request, the model updated and the framework rendered a new view.
AJAX changed that model. It made pages feel alive by allowing partial updates without reloading. This is very close in spirit to MVVM, where bindings keep the UI and state in sync without manual orchestration. The key difference is that AJAX required developers to write event-handlers and DOM updates by hand (the pain was immense), while MVVM provides that synchronisation automatically through data binding.
Put simply:
Classic Web is to MVC as AJAX is to MVVM.
Here’s how the analogy evolved with different generations of web development:
Domain
Baseline (controller-driven, static)
Dynamic (manual glue)
Dynamic (automatic binding)
Web
Classic page submit (MVC)
AJAX (event handlers + DOM)
React / Vue / Angular (declarative, mostly 1-way)
Native/XAML
MVC (controller orchestrates)
Manual events / imperative updates
MVVM (two-way bindings, INotifyPropertyChanged)
This table shows both sides:
Web evolved from Classic MVC → AJAX → modern declarative frameworks.
Native/XAML evolved from MVC → manual events → MVVM.
Both shifts are about making interfaces more dynamic, but MVC kept things request-driven, while MVVM (like AJAX) shifted to continuous, reactive updates.
