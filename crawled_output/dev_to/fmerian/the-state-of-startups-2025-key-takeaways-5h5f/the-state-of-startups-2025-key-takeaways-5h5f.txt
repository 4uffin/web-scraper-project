The State of Startups 2025: Key Takeaways
#discuss
#startup
#webdev
Supabase recently surveyed over 2,000 startup founders and builders to uncover what's powering modern startups: tech stacks, GTM, and approach to AI.
My key takeaways:
AI coding tools are indispensable for startups, and not just Cursor (27%) and VSÂ Code (25%). Vibe coding tools like Lovable, Bolt, and v0 by Vercel are also common.
Most startups are already integrating models like OpenAI (39%) or Anthropic (21%), especially for semantic search, summarisation, and customer support. Half are building agents to automate real tasks, from onboarding flows to sales triage.
Tool discovery happens quite often via YouTube or GitHub. Physical event participation remains low.
Founders earn their earliest customers through personal network (58%), communities, and inbound content. Paid acquisition rarely works early on, nor does performance marketing.
The hardest problems are still the oldest ones: customer acquisition, product-market fit, and complexity.
61% founders remain optimistic about the future.
