Struggling to Connect with Developers? Copywriting Can Transform Your Results Today! (with Practical Examples)
If you're a developer looking to share technical knowledge in a persuasive and engaging way, mastering a few copywriting methods can transform your posts. Below, I explain 4 proven frameworks with examples adapted to the world of web development using React and JavaScript.
🔷 1. AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
Goal: Guide the reader through an emotional and logical journey toward action.
Example:
Attention: ⚠️ Your React App might be slower than it should be.
Interest: And the culprit could be a poorly configured useEffect.
Desire: Want to learn how to avoid unnecessary re-renders and boost performance?
Action: Comment “I want it!” and I’ll send you a mini guide with 3 best practices I use in production.
Tip: Use emojis and short sentences to grab attention in the feed.
🔷 2. FAB — Features, Advantages, Benefits
Goal: Show the real value of a tool or practice.
Example:
The React Profiler is a built-in DevTools feature.
✅ Advantage: It shows exactly where your app is losing performance.
🎯 Benefit: You save hours of debugging and deliver a smoother user experience.
Tip: Perfect for introducing tools, libraries, or coding patterns.
🔷 3. PAS — Problem, Agitation, Solution
Goal: Create urgency and show how to solve it.
Example:
😩 Ever spent hours trying to figure out why your component keeps re-rendering?
This could be draining your app’s performance — and frustrating your team.
🛠️ The solution? Learn how to use React.memo and useCallback effectively.
I created a quick guide with real-world examples. Want the link?
Tip: The “agitation” phase is where you connect with the reader’s pain. Be empathetic and direct.
🔷 4. PAC — Problem, Authority, CTA
Goal: Show expertise on a problem and invite action.
Example:
🚨 Many devs still use setState in ways that break React’s predictability.
I’ve reviewed over 50 PRs with this issue — and I always explain the same fix pattern.
👉 Want to learn how to avoid this in your code? Comment “Fix it” and I’ll send you a practical example.
Tip: Use your experience as proof of authority. It builds trust.
✍️ Conclusion
Copywriting isn’t just for marketing. When used with intention, it turns technical posts into messages that educate, connect, and drive impact.
Let’s connect!
