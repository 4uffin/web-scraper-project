Day 51: CI/CD pipeline pt 2

What is CodeBuild?
• AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service.
• It compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts.
• No need to manage build servers — AWS handles scaling and infrastructure for you.
• Commonly used with CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy.
Tasks for Day 51
Task 01 — Learn & Prep
A.
Read about buildspec.yml:
• This file defines all the build commands and settings for CodeBuild.
• Written in YAML, placed at the root of your repo.
version: 0.2
phases:
install:
commands:
- echo Installing dependencies...
build:
commands:
- echo Build started on `date`
- echo Compiling the application
post_build:
commands:
- echo Build completed on `date`
artifacts:
files:
- '**/*'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
B.
In your CodeCommit repo, create a simple index.html file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Day 51 - CodeBuild Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello from AWS CodeBuild </h1>
</body>
</html>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
C.
Plan to build it using nginx server inside CodeBuild.
⸻
Task 02 — Build with CodeBuild
1.
Create a buildspec.yml file in your repo:
version: 0.2
phases:
install:
runtime-versions:
docker: 18
commands:
- echo Installing Nginx...
- yum install -y nginx
build:
commands:
- echo Build started on `date`
- mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html
- cp index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
post_build:
commands:
- echo Build completed on `date`
- echo Artifacts ready for deployment
artifacts:
files:
- index.html
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
D. Push changes to CodeCommit
git add index.html buildspec.yml
git commit -m "Add index.html and buildspec for CodeBuild"
git push origin main
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In AWS Console → CodeBuild:
Create a new project.
Connect it to your CodeCommit repo.
Choose environment: Managed image → Amazon Linux 2 → Standard runtime.
Use the buildspec.yml you committed.
Start the build → You should see the process install Nginx, copy index.html, and output artifacts.
