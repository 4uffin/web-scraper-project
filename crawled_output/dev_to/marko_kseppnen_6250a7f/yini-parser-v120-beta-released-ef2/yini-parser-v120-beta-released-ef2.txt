🎉 YINI Parser v1.2.0-beta Released

Hi folks!
I just published YINI Parser v1.2.0-beta 🎊 — the latest beta release of the TypeScript/Node.js parser for the YINI configuration format.
This release comes with a mix of fixes, refactors, and quality-of-life improvements, especially around runtime safety and metadata handling.
✨ What's New
🛠️ Fixes
parseFile() now correctly passes through all options (e.g. includeDiagnostics), so behavior now matches parse(..).
Fixed a small typo (in in) in file parsing error messages.
📊 Metadata Improvements
The result metadata structure has been bumped to version 1.1.0.
preservesOrder: true // Member/section order is implementation-defined, not mandated by the spec.
orderGuarantee: 'implementation-defined'
orderNotes?: string

Exit fullscreen mode
These fields make it easier for tooling to reason about how order is preserved.
🔒 Safer Runtime
The public YINI class was refactored to use per-invocation runtime state.
This prevents race conditions when multiple parse(..) / parseFile(..) calls run in parallel.
🗂️ File Layout & Naming
To keep things consistent and tidy:
src/parseEntry.ts → src/pipeline.ts (and _parseEntry(..) → runPipeline(..)).
core/types.ts → core/internalTypes.ts.
Public-facing types/interfaces moved to src/types/index.ts.
src/yiniHelpers.ts → src/utils/yiniHelpers.ts.
🧹 Naming Consistency
Renamed includeMetaData → includeMetadata.
Replaced old TJSObject type with the clearer ParsedObject type throughout the codebase.
📚 Documentation & Tests
Expanded and improved TSDoc comments across the public API.
Unit tests are now colocated with source files (src/**), ensuring 1:1 visibility between code and its tests.
This reduces the chance of missing coverage when refactoring.
🚀 Why This Matters
This release is all about stability and clarity:
You get more accurate metadata out of the box.
Safer runtime behavior when parsing concurrently.
Cleaner project layout that makes contributing and navigating the repo easier.
Better docs for anyone building on top of YINI Parser.
Code Example:
import { ParsedObject, YiniParseResult } from '../types'
import YINI from '../YINI'
const result: YiniParseResult = YINI.parseFile(
'myConfigFile.yini',
{ includeMetadata: true },
)
