Accessing HashiCorp Vault UI in Kubernetes with LoadBalancer Service
#kubernetes

#devops
After successfully deploying Vault in Kubernetes with High Availability (HA) and Raft storage, securely accessing the Vault UI is the next critical step for management and usage.
This guide explains how to expose the Vault UI externally using a LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes.
Why Use a LoadBalancer Service?
Vault UI runs on port 8200 of the Vault service.
By default, Vault Helm chart creates a ClusterIP service, accessible only inside the Kubernetes cluster.
A LoadBalancer service provisions a cloud provider-managed external IP, enabling outside access to Vault UI.
This simplifies browser access and integration with your infrastructure.
Step 1: Create a LoadBalancer Service Manifest
Create a file vault-loadbalancer.yaml with the following content:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: vault-loadbalancer
namespace: vault
spec:
type: LoadBalancer
ports:
- name: http
port: 8200
targetPort: 8200
- name: cluster
port: 8201
targetPort: 8201
selector:
app.kubernetes.io/name: vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: Apply the LoadBalancer Service
Apply the manifest:
kubectl apply -f vault-loadbalancer.yaml -n vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Get the External IP
Check the service and wait for the external IP to be assigned:
kubectl get svc vault-loadbalancer -n vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output will look like:
NAME
TYPE
CLUSTER-IP
EXTERNAL-IP
PORT(S)
AGE
vault-loadbalancer
LoadBalancer
10.x.x.x
<external-ip>
8200:xxxxx/TCP
1m
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Once the <external-ip> populates, you can proceed.
Step 4: Access Vault UI
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://<external-ip>:8200/ui
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You'll be greeted by the Vault UI login page.
Step 5: Login Using Vault Token
Use the root or any valid Vault token generated during Vault initialization.
Enter the token in the login screen to access the UI.
Optional: Secure Your Vault UI
Enable TLS on your Vault server to encrypt UI traffic.
Use Kubernetes Ingress with TLS termination for better control.
Restrict access using firewall rules or VPN.
Alternative for Development
For quick access without a LoadBalancer:
kubectl port-forward svc/vault -n vault 8200:8200
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then open:
http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Conclusion
Using a LoadBalancer service in Kubernetes to expose Vault UI provides convenient external access for users and admins. Combine it with proper security best practices for production deployments.
