Deploying and Managing HashiCorp Vault in Kubernetes with HA and Raft Storage
#kubernetes
#vault
#devops
#linux
Vault is a powerful secrets management tool. Running Vault on Kubernetes in HA mode with Raft backend provides resilience and scalability for secure secrets storage. This guide covers: installing Vault, setting up namespaces, deploying via Helm, joining Vault nodes, unsealing, and troubleshooting common issues.
Prerequisites
Kubernetes cluster accessible with kubectl
Helm 3 installed
Sufficient permissions to create namespaces and PVs
Basic familiarity with Vault concepts and Kubernetes
Step 1: Setting Up Namespace and Helm Repo
Create a namespace for Vault to isolate it:
kubectl create namespace vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Add the HashiCorp Helm repo and update:
helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
helm repo update
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: Installing Vault with Helm in HA Mode
Create a values.yaml for Vault HA using Raft storage (Integrated Storage):
injector:
enabled: false
server:
image:
repository: "hashicorp/vault"
tag: "1.9.0"
# Overrides the default Image Pull Policy
pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
# Configure the Update Strategy Type for the StatefulSet
updateStrategyType: "OnDelete"
resources:
requests:
memory: 256Mi
cpu: 250m
limits:
memory: 256Mi
cpu: 250m
ha:
enabled: true
replicas: 3
raft:
enabled: true
config: |
ui = true
listener "tcp" {
tls_disable = 1
address = "[::]:8200"
cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
}
storage "raft" {
path = "/vault/data"
}
service_registration "kubernetes" {}
dataStorage:
enabled: true
size: 500Mi
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Install Vault:
helm install vault hashicorp/vault -n vault -f values.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Verify pods:
$ kubectl get pods -n vault
NAME
READY
STATUS
RESTARTS
vault-0
0/1
Running
0
vault-1
0/1
Running
0
vault-2
0/1
Running
0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Joining Vault Nodes and Initializing Cluster
Only the first Vault pod (vault-0) is initialized once.
Initialize Vault on vault-0:
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3
Recovery Key 1: FKjt5wkzN5bUBIuR52KrPP1c2Il/f7RZdn5E+ipfNF8s
Recovery Key 2: FCzUyduESPyavh6QtqWZpdnUDKa3bEEpBHbX3NgTrCiU
Recovery Key 3: Tf7FVEpj5tdJLqQqNw/Jt0OytRI5FAZYig/yafSVz3Xg
Recovery Key 4: duLpa/6IozTOR0mkO7sp0CwmnI+1DsC6d2+oZG/A1CIZ
Recovery Key 5: pyVFs/rRFEk9rSn57Ru+KeuAQzW6eurl3j0/pS/JRpXD
Initial Root Token: s.PMOJxNxZYgvXzby5YZr9p3J1
Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.
Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 keys to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!
It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now, we see the Vault unsealer in action:
$ kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_1>
$ kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_2>
$ kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_3>
$ kubectl get pods -n vault
NAME
READY
STATUS
RESTARTS
vault-0
1/1
Running
0
vault-1
0/1
Running
0
vault-2
0/1
Running
0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
However, our replica vault-1 and vault-2 are still not ready. They are follower pods of the leader vault-0. In order to make vault-0 visible, we need to login using our Initial Root Token.
$ kubectl exec -it vault-0 -- vault login s.d0LAlSnAerb4a7d6ibkfxrZy
Success! You are now authenticated. The token information displayed below
is already stored in the token helper. You do NOT need to run "vault login"
again. Future Vault requests will automatically use this token.

token_policies

Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Other pods (vault-1, vault-2) must join the Raft cluster.
Next, let’s join vault-1 and vault-2 to Vault-0 to make the Vault setup Highly available by running commands as shown below:
$ kubectl exec -it vault-1 -n vault -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
Key
Value
---
-----
Joined
true
$ kubectl exec -it vault-2 -n vault -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
Key
Value
---
-----
Joined
true
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Save unseal keys securely.
Step 4: Unsealing Vault Pods
Unseal all Vault pods (vault-0, vault-1, vault-2) manually with the unseal keys:
kubectl exec -it vault-1 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_1>
kubectl exec -it vault-1 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_2>
kubectl exec -it vault-1 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_3>
kubectl exec -it vault-2 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_1>
kubectl exec -it vault-2 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_2>
kubectl exec -it vault-2 -n vault -- vault operator unseal <unseal_key_3>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Let’s check the pod status and this time you would be able to see them in running as well as Ready mode:
$ kubectl get pods -n vault
NAME
READY
STATUS
RESTARTS
vault-0
1/1
Running
0
vault-1
1/1
Running
0
vault-2
1/1
Running
0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The last but important step is to verify whether the HA setup is correct or not, is by running the below command against each Vault pod and making sure that the value of HA Enabled parameters is true.
$ kubectl exec -it -n vault vault-0 -- vault status

Troubleshooting Common Issues
ClusterRoleBinding Already Exists
Delete conflicting ClusterRoleBinding before reinstalling Helm chart:
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding vault-server-binding
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Helm Upgrade Errors ("no deployed releases")
Uninstall previous release from default namespace:
helm uninstall vault -n default
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then install again in the proper namespace.
Pods Not Unsealing or Ready
Check pod logs for errors:
kubectl logs vault-1 -n vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Verify PVCs are bound and healthy:
kubectl get pvc -n vault
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
If corrupted PVC, delete PVC and pod, then rejoin:
kubectl delete pvc data-vault-1 -n vault
kubectl delete pod vault-1 -n vault
kubectl exec -it vault-1 -n vault -- vault operator raft join http://vault-0.vault-internal:8200
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Unseal vault-1 after join with the same unseal keys.
PVC Stuck in Terminating
Remove finalizers to force delete:
kubectl patch pvc data-vault-1 -n vault -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}' --type=merge
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Removing Corrupted Raft Node
Remove node from cluster:
kubectl exec -it vault-0 -n vault -- vault operator raft remove-peer <node-id>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Delete PVC and pod, then re-join as new.
Conclusion
Deploying Vault in Kubernetes with HA and Raft backend provides secure secret storage with scalability. Proper initialization, joining, and unsealing procedures are critical. Troubleshooting involves managing PVC health, pod status, and cluster raft membership carefully.
