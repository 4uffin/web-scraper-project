üêû Troubleshooting 16 KB Page Size Issues

üìñ This article is a continuation of my previous post: Understanding Google Play‚Äôs 16 KB Page Size Requirement for Android Apps.
If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, I recommend starting there for the full context.
Even after updating your SDK/NDK, you might hit issues when testing.
Here are the most common errors and fixes:
‚ùå Error: INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK: unsupported ELF page size
Cause: Your native libraries (.so files) are built only for 4 KB pages, not 16 KB.
Fix:
Update NDK to r26+ (older versions don‚Äôt support 16 KB)**.
sdkmanager "ndk;26.1.10909125"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In android/gradle.properties, set:
ANDROID_NDK_VERSION=26.1.10909125
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Clean and rebuild:
./gradlew clean assembleRelease
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
‚ùå Error: ELF header missing or corrupted when checking with readelf
Cause: The .so file you extracted isn‚Äôt valid or was compressed.
Fix:
Re-extract from the APK using:
unzip app-release.apk -d extracted_apk
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Navigate to lib/arm64-v8a/ before running readelf.
‚ùå Error: App runs on emulator but crashes on physical device (Android 15)
Cause: Some third-party SDKs or libraries bundled in your app may not yet support 16 KB page sizes.
Fix:
Identify the crashing .so file from logs (adb logcat).
Update the dependency to the latest version (check release notes for 16 KB support).
If no update exists, contact the library‚Äôs maintainer or temporarily remove it.
‚ùå Error: Your app must support 16 KB page sizes in Google Play Console (even after rebuild)
Cause: Google Play still detects non-compliant native libraries inside your AAB.
Fix:
Run a full check with:
bundletool build-apks --bundle=app-release.aab --output=output.apks
unzip output.apks -d apks
find apks -name "*.so" | xargs -I {} readelf -h {} | grep "Page size"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Confirm all .so files show 16384.
If one still shows 4096, update/rebuild that library.
‚úÖ Best Practice: Always use the latest versions of:
Android Gradle Plugin (8.5+)
NDK (26+)
compileSdkVersion & targetSdkVersion = 35
This ensures forward compatibility with Android 15+ and avoids Play Store rejection.
