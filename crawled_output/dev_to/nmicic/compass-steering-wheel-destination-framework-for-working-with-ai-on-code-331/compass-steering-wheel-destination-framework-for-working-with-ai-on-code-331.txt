Compass, Steering Wheel, Destination — Framework for Working with AI on Code
#promptengineering

I'm sharing this with the team as a summary of my personal workflow when working with AI on code. It's not an official framework, but rather a set of learnings from experience (polished with a little help from AI, of course). My main goal is to start a conversation. If you have a better or similar workflow, I'd genuinely love to hear about it.
Compass, Steering Wheel, Destination — Framework for Working with AI on Code
AI can accelerate coding, but it can also drift, hallucinate requirements, or produce complex solutions without a clear rationale.
This framework provides the guardrails to keep AI-assisted development focused, deliberate, and well-documented.
Sailing Analogy (High-Level Intro)
Working with AI on code is like sailing:
Compass → Keeps you oriented to true north (goals, requirements, assumptions).
Steering Wheel → Lets you pivot, tack, or hold steady (decide continue vs. change).
Destination Map → Ensures the journey is recorded (reusable, reproducible outcomes).
This framework grew out of real-world experience. It’s not brand new theory, but a way to formalize a shared language for teams working with AI.
Step 1: Compass (Revalidation)
Purpose: keep alignment with goals and assumptions.
Template (copy/paste):
What’s the primary goal?
What’s the secondary/nice-to-have goal?
Which requirements are mandatory vs optional?
What are the current assumptions? Which may be invalid?
Has anything in the context changed (constraints, environment, stakeholders)?
Are human and AI/system understanding still in sync?
Any signs of drift (scope creep, contradictions, wrong optimization target)?
Step 2: Steering Wheel (Course Correction)
Purpose: evaluate if we should continue, pivot, or stop.
Template (copy/paste):
For each assumption: what if it’s false?
Does an existing tool/library cover ≥80%?
Does this map to an existing framework/pattern (ADR, RFC, design template)?
Alternatives:
Different algorithm/data structure?
Different architecture (batch vs streaming, CPU vs GPU, local vs distributed)?
Different representation (sketches, ML, summaries)?
Different layer (infra vs app, control vs data plane)?
Trade-offs:
Fit with requirements.
Complexity (build & maintain).
Time-to-value.
Risks & failure modes.
Other checks:
Overhead vs value: is the process slowing iteration?
Niche & opportunity: is this idea niche or broadly useful? Where does it fit in the landscape?
Kill/Go criteria:
Kill if effort > value, assumptions broken.
Go if results justify effort or uniqueness adds value.
Next step options:
Continue current path.
Pivot to alternative.
Stop and adopt existing solution.
Run a 1-day spike to test a risky assumption.
Step 3: Destination (Reverse Prompt)
Purpose: capture the outcome in reusable, reproducible form.
Template (copy/paste):
Instructions
Restate my request so it can be reused to regenerate the exact same code and documentation.
Include a clear summary of the key idea(s), algorithm(s), and reasoning that shaped the solution.
Preserve wording, structure, and order exactly — no “helpful rewrites” or “improvements.”
Reverse Prompt (regeneration anchor)
Problem restatement (1–2 sentences).
Key algorithm(s) in plain language.
Invariants & assumptions (what must always hold true).
Interfaces & I/O contract (inputs, outputs, error cases).
Config surface (flags, environment variables, options).
Acceptance tests / minimal examples (clear input → output pairs).
High-Level Design (HLD)
Purpose: what the system solves and why.
Key algorithm(s): step-by-step flow, core logic, choice of data structures.
Trade-offs: why this approach was chosen, why others were rejected.
Evolution path: how the design changed from earlier attempts.
Complexity and bottlenecks: where it might fail or slow down.
Low-Level Design (LLD)
Structure: files, functions, modules, data layouts.
Control flow: inputs → processing → outputs.
Error handling and edge cases.
Configuration and options, with examples.
Security and reliability notes.
Performance considerations and optimizations.
Functional Spec / How-To
Practical usage with examples (input/output).
Config examples (simple and advanced).
Troubleshooting (common errors, fixes).
Benchmarks (baseline numbers, reproducible).
Limits and gotchas.
Roadmap / extensions.
Critical Requirements
Always present HLD first, then LLD.
Emphasize algorithms and reasoning over just the raw code.
Clearly mark discarded alternatives with reasons.
Keep the response self-contained — it should stand alone as documentation even without the code.
Preserve the code exactly as it was produced originally. No silent changes, no creative rewrites.
When & Why to Use Each
Compass (Revalidation):
Use at the start or whenever misalignment is suspected (context drift, new requirements).
Steering Wheel (Course Correction):
Use at milestones or retrospectives to decide continue, pivot, or stop.
Destination (Reverse Prompt):
Use at the end of a cycle/project to capture reproducible documentation & handover artifacts.
References & Correlations
This framework is simple, but it builds on proven practices:
Systems Engineering: Verification & Validation (build the right thing).
Agile: Sprint reviews (revalidation), retrospectives (course correction).
Lean Startup: Pivot vs. persevere decisions.
Architecture Practices: ADRs (decision rationale, alternatives).
AI Prompt Engineering: Reusable prompt templates & libraries.
Human-in-the-Loop Design: Oversight to prevent drift in AI systems.
By combining them under a sailing metaphor, the framework becomes:
Easy to remember.
Easy to communicate inside teams.
Easy to apply in AI-assisted coding where drift, misalignment, and reusability are everyday challenges.
Closing Note
Think of this as a playbook, not theory. Next time in a session, just say:
“Compass check” → Revalidate assumptions/goals.
“Steering wheel” → Consider pivot/alternatives.
“Destination” → Capture reproducible docs.
