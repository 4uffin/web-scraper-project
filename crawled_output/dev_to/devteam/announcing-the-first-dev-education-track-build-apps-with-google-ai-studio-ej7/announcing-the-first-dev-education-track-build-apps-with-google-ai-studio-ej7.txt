Announcing the First DEV Education Track: "Build Apps with Google AI Studio"
#learngoogleaistudio
#ai
#deved
#gemini
The moment is here! We recently announced DEV Education Tracks, our new initiative to bring you structured learning paths directly from industry experts.
Today, we're thrilled to launch our very first track in partnership with the team at Google AI. This track will guide you through Google AI Studio's new "Build apps with Gemini" feature, where you can turn a simple text prompt into a fully functional, deployed web application in minutes.
How to Complete This Track
This DEV Education Track is a three-part experience: 1) an expert tutorial followed by 2) a hands-on build and 3) a writing assignment. Work through all three parts and you'll earn the "Build Apps with Google AI Studio" badge.
üìñ Part 1: Follow the Expert Tutorial
Start with this comprehensive guide created by @dynamicwebpaige and @olivier_lacombe from the team at Google AI:
From prompt to deployed app in less than 2 minutes

#programming
#ai
#gemini
You'll learn how to use the "Build apps with Gemini" feature from idea to deployment.
ü§ñ Part 2: Build Your Own App
After you've worked through the tutorial, it's time to put your new skills to the test!
Your assignment is to use the build feature in Google AI Studio to build an app that incorporates image generation with the Imagen API.
We encourage you to come up with your own apps, but here are some ideas if you need inspiration:
RPG character portrait generator
Fridge-photo based recipe generator
On-demand coloring book generator
Logo generator for business ideas
‚úèÔ∏è Part 3: Earn Community Recognition
Everyone who completes the track by sharing their assignments will earn the exclusive "Build Apps with Google AI" badge on their DEV profile!
Use our official submission template to share your assignment:
Share Your Project
Badge Design üòç
Our badge acts as a certificate of completion that you can highlight on your DEV profile. It'll look like this:
Badge Requirements
To earn your badge, your project submission post must:
Use the "Build apps with Gemini" feature in Google AI Studio.
Include the prompt you used to generate the app, and mention any other features you utilized.
Include a link to your applet or fully deployed URL.
Briefly describe your experience and what you learned.
Our team will review submissions on a rolling basis with badges awarded every few days. There's no deadline, so take your time and build something you're proud of!
A New Way to Learn
This inaugural track perfectly exemplifies our goal for DEV Education Tracks: to close the gap between discovering a new technology and building with it confidently. By partnering directly with the Google AI team, we're able to bring you an authoritative, hands-on guide to one of the most exciting new tools in AI development.
We can't wait to see what you create. Happy building! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Just made this app so quickly. Interesting what is different from build at AI Studio and Google CLI. Seems like AI Studio works better.
Anyways, check this:

Too bad you specified that it has to interface with the Imagen API, I actually have an app idea and was interested in trying Google AI Studio to build it. I still will, and will probably watch the tutorial, but I won‚Äôt be able to get the badge

Just submitted my entry! üé®
Built a coloring page generator that turns text descriptions into kid-friendly black-and-white drawings using Google AI Studio + Imagen API. The prompt engineering process was incredible - went from idea to deployed app in 30 minutes! Took 30 minutes just because I was unfamiliar with the Google Cloud API Console and deployment stuff.
