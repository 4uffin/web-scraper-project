I work in a service-based corporate role where we primarily use Python. As many know, Python can be quite slow, especially when dealing with large datasets. We often work with MDF files and signal data, which used to take around 10 minutes just to load.
Recognizing this bottleneck, I proposed offloading the loading and computation parts to Rust for better performance. Initially, management was skeptical and resistant to the idea. It took quite a bit of effort to convince them, and the process was definitely hectic.
But eventually, I got the green light‚Äîand the results were amazing. The entire desktop application now loads in just 10‚Äì15 seconds. Huge win!

I started building Free DevTools, and it's just going well.
I thought Astro would be great for my use case, but it has a lot of problems, and I've been solving them all week.
Yeah, a lot of things to take care of.
Hard but getting better and better.
Hopefully that gets used ;)
