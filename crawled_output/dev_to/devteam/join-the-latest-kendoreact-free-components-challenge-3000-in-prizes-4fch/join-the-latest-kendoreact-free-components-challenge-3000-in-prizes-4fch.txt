We're excited to announce the return of a beloved challenged!
Running through September 21, our latest KendoReact Free Components Challenge invites you to explore KendoReact's free UI components and discover how their AI tools can accelerate your workflow.
With 50+ free components available, you'll have everything you need to build a polished, high-performing and accessible application.
We hope you give it a try!
Our Prompt
Build Without Boundaries
For this challenge, what you build is entirely up to you as long as you build a React app of your choice that utilizes at least 10 free KendoReact UI components. Show us your creativity and demonstrate the versatility of KendoReact's component library!
Additional Prize Categories
In addition or our overall prompt, submissions may qualify for two additional prize categories:
Code Smarter, Not Harder: Use the KendoReact AI Coding Assistant to help build part (or all) of your app. Start a 30-day free trial (no credit card required) and make sure to describe where and how you used the AI Coding Assistant in your submission!
RAGs to Riches: There's a brand new member of the Progress family: Nuclia! This RAG-as-a-service tool makes deploying Agentic RAG a breeze. Include it in your app (requires starting a 14-day trial, no credit card required), share your experience, and qualify for this additional prize category!
Prizes
We'll select one overall prompt winner and a winner for each additional prize category.
Each winner will receive:
$1,000 USD
Exclusive DEV Badge
DEV++ Membership
All Participants with a valid submission will receive a completion badge on their DEV profile.
Judging Criteria
Each submission will be judged on the following:
Use of underlying technology
Usability and User Experience
Accessibility
Creativity
How To Participate
In order to participate, you will need to publish a post using our submission template below. You are welcome to use any framework as long as the UI is powered by React, and you include at least 10 KendoReact Free Components in your submission.
KendoReact Challenge Submission Template
We can't wait to see what you build!

You got this! We're here to help if you have any questions. If it might make you feel more comfortable, you could always group up with a friend and work together! Or, join the Progress Labs Discord group, where you'll find lots of support if you want to brainstorm ideas, ask tech questions, or just talk with other devs about how it's going
😊

Just a react app made using KendoReact works or a backend is also required for it?

Just a React app! You're welcome to add a backend if it's needed for your idea, but it's not a requirement

Do we require to make it live on domain? (VPS is required since it uses MySQL too)
I am planning to make a good scalable application MVP with backend, but the deployment cost can be a problem for me as a student.
