Hey everyone,
I am Lucia a web developer who enjoys building clean and responsive sites. I joined here to learn from other developers, share a bit of my own journey, and hopefully make some good connections along the way. Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to customize my own website, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since!

Hey DEV! üëã
I‚Äôm building Pocket Portfolio, a tiny open-source, privacy-first portfolio tracker. No brokerage link‚Äîjust add trades (or CSV), see live prices/P/L, and a clean UI. I‚Äôm here to learn from this community and level-up on accessibility, service-worker/PWA patterns, and secure CSPs on Vercel + Firebase.
If you‚Äôve got 5‚Äì7 mins, I‚Äôd love feedback from devs/designers:
App: pocketportfolio.app/app/
Repo (MIT): github.com/PocketPortfolio/Financi...
Happy to credit helpful testers in the README.
Fun fact: I still love spreadsheets‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm trying to make this nicer than one üòÑ

üëã Hey everyone! I'm Abraham from Munich!I'm a Senior Solutions Architect at AWS and the creator behind MyITBasics.com.
Currently balancing my AWS job with pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (ML) at University of Illinois.I love diving deep into authentication architecture, container orchestration, and ML deployment patterns.
My goal with MyITBasics is creating comprehensive technical guides that bridge academic theory with real-world implementation - the kind of content you actually bookmark and return to!
Fun fact: can code-switch between English, Spanish, and German depending on which stack overflow thread I'm reading! üòÖ
Looking forward to learning from this amazing community and sharing insights from building enterprise systems.
