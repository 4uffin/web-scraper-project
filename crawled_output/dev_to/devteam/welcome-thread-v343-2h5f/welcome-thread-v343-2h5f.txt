Hey everyone,
I am Lucia a web developer who enjoys building clean and responsive sites. I joined here to learn from other developers, share a bit of my own journey, and hopefully make some good connections along the way. Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to customize my own website, and I’ve been hooked ever since!

Hello
I am a senior accounts and finance professional with more than a passing interest in technology. Right time to join the community for me I guess, because coding is becoming less and less important.
Cricket anyone?
