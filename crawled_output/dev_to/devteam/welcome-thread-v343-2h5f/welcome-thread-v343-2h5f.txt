Hello
I am a senior accounts and finance professional with more than a passing interest in technology. Right time to join the community for me I guess, because coding is becoming less and less important.
Cricket anyone?

Hey DEV! 👋
I’m building Pocket Portfolio, a tiny open-source, privacy-first portfolio tracker. No brokerage link—just add trades (or CSV), see live prices/P/L, and a clean UI. I’m here to learn from this community and level-up on accessibility, service-worker/PWA patterns, and secure CSPs on Vercel + Firebase.
If you’ve got 5–7 mins, I’d love feedback from devs/designers:
App: pocketportfolio.app/app/
Repo (MIT): github.com/PocketPortfolio/Financi...
Happy to credit helpful testers in the README.
Fun fact: I still love spreadsheets…but I’m trying to make this nicer than one 😄

Hey everyone,
I am Lucia a web developer who enjoys building clean and responsive sites. I joined here to learn from other developers, share a bit of my own journey, and hopefully make some good connections along the way. Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to customize my own website, and I’ve been hooked ever since!
