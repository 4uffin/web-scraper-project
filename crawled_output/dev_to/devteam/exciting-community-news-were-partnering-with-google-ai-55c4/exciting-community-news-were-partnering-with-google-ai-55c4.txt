Exciting Community News: We're Partnering with Google AI!

üëã Hey there, we will continue to update this post with relevant news if you're coming here weeks after the initial announcement.
Coming soon: DEV Education Tracks will launch with the Google AI Track.
üëâ Use this link to get started with Google AI Studio
We are excited to share that we're partnering with Google AI on some exciting new initiatives for the community.
We will cover some high level details here, but will surely follow up as specific challenges, events and more roll out.
It‚Äôs been clear for a while now that AI has quickly established itself as one of the most hyped, sometimes over-hyped, controversial, and important trends to impact software development in recent memory.
With such a massive and important shift underway, we kicked off a search to find a top-level AI partner to help us educate the community, offer resources to our members, and help improve the Forem codebase through a new suite of AI-powered functionality.
We are delighted to join forces with Google AI as DEV‚Äôs Official AI Model and Platform Partner.
This collaboration is designed to bring the power of Google's latest AI models directly to you, the developers who make DEV a hub of innovation and knowledge-sharing.
Google‚Äôs Gemini model is currently considered one of the most powerful and versatile large language models available, excelling in a wide range of benchmarks. As the day-to-day work of software developers becomes more integrated with AI workflows, we see an opportunity to enhance the DEV Community experience in meaningful ways.
What This Collaboration Brings
Our work with Google AI will focus on practical applications that support and empower our community members. We believe that AI should not be a tool that hogs the mic, but rather one that helps pass the mic to more people, fostering deeper connections and amplifying valuable ideas.
Community Challenges and Learning Tracks
To help developers get hands-on with the capabilities of modern AI, we will be introducing a series of community challenges and learning tracks. These initiatives will provide structured opportunities to understand and leverage models like Gemini. Whether you're a seasoned machine learning engineer or just starting to explore the potential of AI, these programs will offer a practical path to building new skills and creating innovative projects.
Expect more of the DEV Challenges that you know and love, along with a few new education-focused wrinkles to help you learn new skills and showcase your knowledge.
Thoughtful Feature Integrations
We are not rushing towards new integrations just for the sake of implementing shiny features powered by AI.
It‚Äôs important to us that we continue to provide value directly to the community and prioritize work that actually elevates your experience. However we have been thinking deeply about possible evolutions of serving the community for a while now, and partnering with Google AI to help make them a reality is something we are looking forward to doing.
We are exploring several ways to subtly weave Gemini's power into the DEV Community platform. Our goal is to introduce features that enhance your experience without being intrusive. Imagine AI-powered tools that can help you:
Discover relevant content and people: Get more personalized recommendations for articles, discussions, and community members who you can learn from.
Facilitate meaningful discussions: Specifically helping people find others where their perspective is most valuable.
Underlying spam-fighting functionality: Enhance our ability to keep the platform safe and welcoming, and free of low-quality content, with functionality that can be demoed in our open-source code at github.com/forem/forem.
These integrations, powered by Gemini, will be developed with a community-first mindset, ensuring that they serve to connect people and ideas more effectively.
Future Initiatives
The above collaborative initiatives with Google AI
are just the beginning. We are committed to an ongoing process of learning and exploration alongside the community. We will be listening to your feedback and observing how these new tools are used to guide our future development. Our roadmap will be shaped by what we learn together, with the ultimate goal of better serving the needs of every developer on DEV.
What's Next?
We will be rolling out these new initiatives in the coming months. Keep an eye out for announcements about our first community challenge and the initial set of feature integrations. We are excited to embark on this journey with you and can't wait to see what we will build together. Your feedback will be invaluable as we move forward, and we‚Äôll be creating dedicated spaces for you to share your thoughts and ideas.
If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Google AI, a great place to start is catching up with their latest announcements from Google I/O:
For a written overview, check out Building with AI: highlights for developers at Google I/O.
The write-up covers model updates including Gemini 2.5 Pro, new integrations and tools , and much much more. All updates we are very excited about!
As always, Happy Coding ‚ù§Ô∏è

Hopefully we can use it to fight the spam posts we get every day. It'd be great if inside the Moderation tag, we could see a "semaphore-like" indicator next to every new post to moderate. Based on the subject, account age, amount of published posts in the last 24 hours, etc.
