From privacy-first citizen science dApps to deployment tools that enhance the Midnight ecosystem, we loved reviewing the diverse submissions shared by participants. We hope everyone enjoyed learning about and working with zero-knowledge proofs and Midnight's data-protection blockchain!
Without further ado, our winners.
Congratulations To…

All participants will receive a completion badge for taking on this challenging exploration of privacy-first development!
Our Sponsor
A huge shoutout to our sponsor, Midnight Foundation. The Midnight Foundation is an organization dedicated to growing the Midnight network — a fourth-generation blockchain built for secure, compliant, and private decentralised applications — and supporting the global community around it. They help developers, creators, and privacy advocates build tools that protect personal data, support digital freedom, and power the breakthrough generation of blockchain innovation.
Their goal is to make Midnight's technology open and accessible to everyone. By breaking down barriers and encouraging collaboration, they're helping to build a more fair, decentralised internet — one that's trustless and respects individual privacy.
