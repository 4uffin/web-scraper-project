Security-first container images with lightning-fast development cycles
Introduction
Chainguard Images provides security-focused container images built on Wolfi, maintaining zero known CVEs while enabling rapid development. This distroless image repository has solved the traditional security-speed trade-off through systematic collaboration practices.
We analyzed their development patterns on collab.dev and discovered how they achieve both security rigor and exceptional velocity.
Key Highlights
Ultra-fast processing: 6-second overall wait time demonstrates exceptional development velocity
Perfect review discipline: 100% review coverage with 100% approval rate - zero rejected PRs
Rapid approval cycles: 1m 52s median approval time shows streamlined security decision-making
Instant responsiveness: 0-second initial wait and reviewer response times eliminate bottlenecks
Balanced automation: 35% bot activity handles routine security updates while maintaining human oversight
Community-core balance: 35% community contributions with 30% core team involvement
Efficient merge process: 75th percentile merge time spans 3 days, showing careful evaluation for complex changes
Security Engineering at Speed
Chainguard demonstrates that security and velocity aren't mutually exclusive. Their 6-second overall wait time and 1m 52s median approval time rival the fastest non-security projects, while maintaining 100% review coverage for security-critical changes.
What makes this particularly impressive is the context: container security requires evaluating base image updates, dependency changes, and vulnerability patches‚Äîall areas where a single oversight can compromise entire application stacks. Yet their 26m 59s review turnaround with 58.5% of reviews within 1 hour shows a team optimized for security urgency.
The 0-second initial wait and reviewer response times eliminate the typical delays that plague security updates. Combined with a 100% approval rate, this suggests exceptionally well-prepared contributions that rarely require rework‚Äîa hallmark of mature security engineering processes.
This speed matters in practice. When a critical vulnerability like Log4Shell emerges, organizations need updated secure base images within hours, not days. Chainguard's metrics suggest they've built processes that can respond to security incidents at the pace modern threats demand.
Strategic Automation and Community Trust
35% bot-generated PRs handle automated security updates and vulnerability patches, creating a continuous security maintenance pipeline. This isn't just efficiency‚Äîit's a security strategy that ensures consistent application of patches without human delay or error.
The remaining 65% human oversight focuses on architectural decisions, new image variants, and complex security evaluations where human judgment remains essential. This division of labor allows security experts to concentrate on high-value decisions while automation handles routine maintenance.
Even more remarkable is the 35% community contribution rate for security infrastructure. Building trust with external contributors on security-critical projects requires exceptional transparency and processes. The 1h 3m 52s median merge time reflects careful evaluation that doesn't sacrifice thoroughness for speed‚Äîessential when community contributions affect the security posture of downstream applications.
The data reveals an interesting distribution: while most changes merge quickly (median ~1 hour), the 75th percentile extends to 3 days, indicating that complex security changes receive extended evaluation when needed. This dual-speed approach‚Äîfast for routine updates, thorough for complex changes‚Äîexemplifies mature security engineering.
Conclusion
Chainguard Images shows that security and velocity aren't mutually exclusive. Their collaboration metrics reveal a project that has systematized security excellence without sacrificing development speed.

Chainguard's approach is impressive; it combines security-first container images with rapid development cycles. Their use of Wolfi and commitment to zero CVEs establishes a high standard for secure and efficient containerization.

Agreed. What really stands out is how they've made secure-by-default actually faster to work with, not slower. That's the kind of tooling shift that changes how entire teams think about security in their workflows.
