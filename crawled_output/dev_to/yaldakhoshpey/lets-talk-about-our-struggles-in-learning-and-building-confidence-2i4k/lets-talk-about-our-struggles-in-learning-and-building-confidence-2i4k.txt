Let’s Talk About Our Struggles in Learning and Building Confidence😉

When we start learning something new — coding, writing, design, or any creative craft — it’s rarely smooth.
For me, one of the hardest moments was dealing with other people’s opinions.
I used to worry about what others might think of my work… until I realized something powerful: I am enough as I am. No one is perfect, and no one has to be.
That shift helped me stop chasing perfection and finally start.
💭 Think about it:
What was your worst memory during your learning journey?
What fears stopped you from starting?
How did you eventually build the confidence to take the first real step?
How do you fight the voice of perfectionism that whispers: “It’s not good enough yet”?
And beyond that — what are your dreams? What do you hope changes in our community, in our industry, or in the way we support each other?
✨ I believe talking openly about these struggles can inspire others who are just starting out.
If you share your story, you might be giving someone else the push they need today.
I’d love to hear your experiences in the comments.
Let’s make this space not only about skills and tools, but also about courage, resilience, and growth.💖

I can't imagine my day without learning something new. If I don't get anything, for me it's a wasted day. Of course, my brain can't be in work mode 24/7, but I truly feel useful when I study, when I talk to smart people, and when I read such cool stories as yours.
