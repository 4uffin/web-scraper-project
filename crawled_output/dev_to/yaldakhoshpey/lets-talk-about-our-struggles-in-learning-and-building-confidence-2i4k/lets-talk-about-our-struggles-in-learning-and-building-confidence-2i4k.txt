Let’s Talk About Our Struggles in Learning and Building Confidence😉
#learning

When we start learning something new — coding, writing, design, or any creative craft — it’s rarely smooth.
For me, one of the hardest moments was dealing with other people’s opinions.
I used to worry about what others might think of my work… until I realized something powerful: I am enough as I am. No one is perfect, and no one has to be.
That shift helped me stop chasing perfection and finally start.
💭 Think about it:
What was your worst memory during your learning journey?
What fears stopped you from starting?
How did you eventually build the confidence to take the first real step?
How do you fight the voice of perfectionism that whispers: “It’s not good enough yet”?
And beyond that — what are your dreams? What do you hope changes in our community, in our industry, or in the way we support each other?
✨ I believe talking openly about these struggles can inspire others who are just starting out.
If you share your story, you might be giving someone else the push they need today.
I’d love to hear your experiences in the comments.
Let’s make this space not only about skills and tools, but also about courage, resilience, and growth.💖

What was your worst memory during your learning journey?
When I was first getting into coding — while being completely broke literally sleeping in a crawlspace above a bathroom with 8 roommates — I was so stressed I got shingles.
It was just part of my journey I guess?

I can't imagine my day without learning something new. If I don't get anything, for me it's a wasted day. Of course, my brain can't be in work mode 24/7, but I truly feel useful when I study, when I talk to smart people, and when I read such cool stories as yours.

The biggest struggle for me is managing not to get too overwhelmed with all the things I want to learn. Whenever I jumped from technology to technology, from course to course I ended up completely exhausted and confused at some point. I don't want to make this mistake anymore.
A couple months ago, I dedcided I'm gonna start with small projects and gradually build my way up. At first, I built a simple CLI tool, then a basic API and a quiz game with an in-memory database etc. This has really helped me stay consistent and actually build something, even if it's basic.
Since my goal is becoming a fullstack developer, I'm now tackling vanilla HTML/CSS/JS challanges almost daily. Whenever I complete a project, I reward myself with some Laracasts backend PHP/Laravel videos.
It's very easy to get overwhelmed and quit which is why it's important to not overwhelm yourself and start small.

I've been wanting to dive into the world of robotics for a while now and even got a beginner Arduino kit to start experimenting with. But somehow I keep finding other things to do instead of actually starting. I think subconsciously I'm feeling that it'll take a lot of time to learn and the tangible results won't come quickly. Plus there will be additional costs involved.
There's this Russian expression "и хочется и колется" (literally "you want it and it prickles") - basically when you really want something but you're also scared/hesitant about it lol.
But you know what? Writing this comment made me realize that tomorrow I'm actually going to start digging into it! Sometimes we just need to acknowledge our fears out loud to move past them.

In my case it wasn't hard at all to start learning web development. I didn't have any fears in that moment, at the time when I took the decision.
It was kind of like a childhood passion, that I somehow started to follow years later. It felt so cool as a kid to think about those hackers that master computers and programming. It was like, that's crazy, how do they do that? While for me programming was something so untouchable, couldn't wrap my head around it.
I started exactly 1 year ago and I remember my worst memories are related to those moments when I felt truly discouraged. I would try to solve a JavaScript challenge and fail and then the whole world seemed to break. I would want to make a simple app and had no idea what to begin with. So then I would feel so small and stupid. Like 'you will never never be a programmer, promise you'.
Somehow I didn't stop. I am stubborn by nature and that helped a lot. Today I am nothing, I fail, I can't focus, I can't work. I know it is just a bad day. Tomorow I rise again, I can do it, I take it slowly with baby steps. I never said 'that's it, I stop, this is the end'. Whenever it's a bad day, it's just one, or two or whatever. But keep going.
And about the perfectionistic side of things. In my case, it makes me do everything better. This helped me come closer to achieving my goals of being a fullstack. Polish more, struggle more, learn more. Do better. Do more. It is a good thing, but I would encourage people to learn how to tame it, because at the same time being a perfectionist person could break you more than it can build you.
