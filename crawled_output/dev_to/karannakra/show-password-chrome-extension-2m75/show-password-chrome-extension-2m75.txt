Show Password – Chrome Extension

Got it 👍 I’ve updated the LinkedIn post draft to clearly mention installation instructions, GitHub availability, and that support for other browsers/stores is coming soon:
👨‍💻 If you’re a web developer, you’ve definitely been here…
You’re testing a login form, typing your password again and again… and then realize you mistyped.
What happens next?
👉 Open DevTools
👉 Inspect the input field
👉 Change type="password" → type="text"
👉 Finally, you can see the password.
I’ve been there countless times — and honestly, it sucks. It breaks your flow and feels like unnecessary overhead for something so small.
So, I built a solution. 🚀
✨ A Chrome Extension that lets you reveal your password instantly — no DevTools, no extra clicks, just one clean action.
🔹 Saves time
🔹 Keeps you in the flow
🔹 Super lightweight
Right now, it’s available only on GitHub, and can be installed manually in Chrome.
📎 Please find the installation instructions in the attached README.
🌍 Browser & store support:
✅ Chrome (via GitHub install)
⏳ Firefox, Edge, Opera → coming soon
⏳ Chrome Web Store & other browser stores → coming soon
If this sounds useful, you can try it out here: 🔗 GitHub link
⭐ And if you like it, please leave a star on the repo — it really helps and keeps me motivated to build more dev-friendly tools!
