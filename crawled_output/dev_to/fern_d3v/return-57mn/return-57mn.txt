When things change
I had to take a small break from writing my weekly blog. I don't know about many of you, but I am a creature of habit, and if that habit is broken or interrupted at all everything goes down the drain. I had gotten a job after taking a couple months to myself, and severely underestimated the toll of working full time again and studying full time webdev / maintaining a weekly custom blog.
While that was a really cool project, and I will probably go back to it at some point. I think from here out, I am just going to be publishing my articles here. My original goal was to catalogue my learning journey and if I feel too overwhelmed to do everything that went into maintaining my blog, then I'm just not going to write the post or upload it.
Looking to the future
While I may have taken a break from writing a weekly blog, I did not take a break from learning and building. I have made a couple fun little CLI tools for learning purposes and am actively working on my first actual CLI app that I will personally be using and hope others find use in it as well (more on that very very soon, probably monday).
I am still not even halfway through my full stack dev path, but I can tell you this right now, I think I want to make CLI tools for devs to use. My biggest thing in life has been that I enjoy being of assistance to others. And in this field, what better way to do that than to work on dev tools?
I recently read this article about how developers don't make things anymore for the joy of learning something new. That really struck a cord with me. I used to be a video editor and one of my favorite things to do in my downtime was to tinker with weird things or to learn a new method for doing something to grow my abilities. I feel my natural desire to assist, coupled with my love of tinkering and learning will lend itself well regardless of what I end up doing as a dev.
