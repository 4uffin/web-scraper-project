Hey everyone,
I am Lucia a web developer who enjoys building clean and responsive sites. I joined here to learn from other developers, share a bit of my own journey, and hopefully make some good connections along the way. Fun fact: I started coding because I wanted to customize my own website, and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since!
