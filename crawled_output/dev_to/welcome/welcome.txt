Hi everyone! I am Moiz, and I am here to learn and teach what I have learned so far. I am passionate about blockchain and Web3 because I am most interested in that, and another reason is sensed through my development in Web3 is most developers or users avoid Web3 they don't embrace this technology, and in some ways, they are right to do so because there are a lot of scammers in this field, so trust won't come here easily. And as a blockchain developer, I must do my part and let people experience its full potential.
