Hi everyone! I am Moiz, and I am here to learn and teach what I have learned so far. I am passionate about blockchain and Web3 because I am most interested in that, and another reason is sensed through my development in Web3 is most developers or users avoid Web3 they don't embrace this technology, and in some ways, they are right to do so because there are a lot of scammers in this field, so trust won't come here easily. And as a blockchain developer, I must do my part and let people experience its full potential.

üëã Hey everyone! I'm Masoom, a tech enthusiast with a background in planetary science ü™ê and a passion for data, code, and cosmic exploration. I recently set up Git and VS Code on my Windows 11 machine and started writing about workflow setups for science devs.
I‚Äôm here to share, learn, and connect with fellow developers‚Äîespecially those working at the intersection of space, data, and open-source! üöÄ
A fun fact about me: I once tried simulating Martian weather patterns using Python, and the code crashed because I forgot Mars has no Wi-Fi. üòâ
Looking forward to reading your stories and helping out where I can!
And here's a simple reply you can post to someone else's comment:
üëã Welcome aboard! Loved hearing about your journey. What kind of projects are you working on these days?

ROFL - This box is not near big enough to fit my years of experience. For example I was doing multi-threading in C# months after it was added to the C# library.

Hello Forum. I have been around awhile. The first language I learned was Fortran. For those wondering why I left off the version number, IBM Research was still developing the language. After a built a couple S100 systems for IBM, I met someone who was on the IBM PC team before it was released. When Microsoft was still developing Visual Studio and C#, I was a beta tester and over 20 years latter, I am still finding bugs.
