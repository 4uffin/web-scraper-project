📦 My DevOps Journey: Part 4 — Archiving, Scheduling, Remote Access & System Administration Essentials
#devops

After learning about permissions, ownership, and package managers in Part 3, I realized that being comfortable with Linux also means being able to manage files, automate tasks, secure access, and work across systems.
This part of my journey dives into some of the most practical everyday tools of a DevOps engineer: archiving, cronjobs, SSH, SCP, virtual machines, and key pairs.
📂Archiving & Compression
One of my first real struggles was handling log backups. I had thousands of log files in /var/log/, and transferring them individually was a nightmare.
So I used tar:
tar -cvf logs.tar /var/log/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
/var/log/syslog
/var/log/auth.log
/var/log/kern.log
...
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Later, to extract:
tar -xvf logs.tar
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then I tried compressing a single file:
gzip demo.txt
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
demo.txt → demo.txt.gz
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Instead of moving hundreds of files, I just tar them into one archive, transfer, and extract. Much cleaner.
⏰ Automating Tasks with Cronjobs
I hated repeating backups manually, so I created a cronjob.
crontab -e
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I added:
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
To check:
crontab -l
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
0 0 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Troubleshooting: At first, my cronjob didn’t run. The issue? My script used python3, but cron didn’t recognize it. I fixed it by giving the full path:
/usr/bin/python3 /home/user/backup.py
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
🔐 Security & System Administration Basics
Next, I explored system security.
Creating a new user:
sudo adduser dev
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
Adding user `dev' ...
Adding new group `dev' (1002) ...
Creating home directory `/home/dev' ...
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Giving sudo rights:
sudo usermod -aG sudo dev
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: I once mistakenly gave a developer sudo rights when he only needed file access. It taught me that least privilege is key in production.
🌐 Remote Connections with SSH
When I first tried logging into a server:
ssh user@192.168.1.10
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
It asked for a password — fine. But when I disabled password login, I hit this error:
Permission denied (publickey).
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 The fix was to use SSH key pairs.
🔑 Generating SSH Key Pairs
I generated a key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sheershsinha30@gmail.com"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then copied it to the server:
ssh-copy-id user@192.168.1.10
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now login works without typing a password:
ssh user@192.168.1.10
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
💻 Creating Virtual Machines
Before trying things on production servers, I practiced on VirtualBox:
Created a VM with Ubuntu.
Configured NAT networking.
Installed nginx inside the VM:
sudo apt install nginx -y
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Verified:
systemctl status nginx
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Output:
nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
Active: active (running)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Breaking things in a VM is safe — I just reverted to a snapshot.
🌟 Key Takeaways from Part 4
Archiving makes backups portable.
Cronjobs automate repetitive tasks.
System security is about principle of least privilege.
SSH & SCP are lifelines for remote management.
SSH key pairs enable passwordless secure automation.
Virtual machines provide a safe DevOps sandbox.
🚀 What’s Next (Part 5: Shell Scripting)
After learning permissions, automation, and SSH, I realized that typing commands again and again isn’t efficient. That’s where Shell Scripting comes in — the real glue of DevOps.
In the next part of my journey, I’ll cover:
🐚 Introduction to Shell Scripting — Why scripts matter in DevOps.
✍️ Write & execute a simple script — Going from one-liners to automation.
📦 Variables & Operators — Storing values and doing calculations.
👤 Read user input — Making scripts interactive.
🔄 Functions & Loops — Reusing and repeating code smartly.
⚡ Shell vs sh vs Bash — What’s the difference?
📝 How to write Bash scripts — Best practices for real-world use.
🤔 Conditional Statements — Adding logic to decisions.
📥 Passing Arguments to a Script — Making scripts flexible and reusable.
This will be the point where I move from “just running commands” to building automation workflows — a must-have step for any DevOps engineer.
