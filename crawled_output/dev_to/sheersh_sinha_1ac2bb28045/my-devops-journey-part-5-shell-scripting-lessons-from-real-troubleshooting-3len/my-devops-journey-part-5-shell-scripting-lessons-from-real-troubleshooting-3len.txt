🐚 My DevOps Journey: Part 5 — Shell Scripting Lessons from Real Troubleshooting
#devops

After setting up cronjobs in
Part 4
, I realized typing commands manually wasn’t scaling. In the real world, systems don’t wait for you to type — they break when you’re asleep. That’s when I leaned on Shell Scripting.
But instead of learning it the “classroom way,” I picked it up through real troubleshooting scenarios. Each concept — variables, arguments, loops — came alive only when I faced a problem I had to solve.
Here’s how scripting became my real-world rescue tool.
1️⃣ Writing My First Script — The “On-Call Repetition Nightmare”
Scenario: During my internship, disk alerts kept firing at midnight. Every time, I’d log in and type df -h manually. It was exhausting.
Solution:
I wrote a script called diskcheck.sh:
#!/bin/bash
df -h
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now, instead of typing commands half-asleep, I just ran:
./diskcheck.sh
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Scripts are your second brain during on-call duty.
2️⃣ Variables — The “Multiple Servers, One Script” Challenge
Scenario: I had to check connectivity for 3 different servers. My first script hardcoded the IP. If the server changed, the script broke.
Solution:
Use variables:
Later, I swapped the value, and the script worked everywhere.
👉 Lesson: Variables save scripts from becoming useless with changing infrastructure.
3️⃣ Operators — The “Disk Space Alert” Problem
Scenario: A staging server ran out of space, crashing the app. I needed a script to check disk usage and alert only when it crossed 80%.
Solution:
USED=$(df / | grep / | awk '{ print $5 }' | sed 's/%//g')
THRESHOLD=80
if [ $USED -gt $THRESHOLD ]; then
echo " Disk usage critical: $USED%"
fi
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Operators + conditions = automated monitoring without external tools.
4️⃣ Read User Input — The “Backup Flexibility” Problem
Scenario: My backup script only archived /home/, but once I needed /etc/ configs too. Editing the script every time was painful.
Solution: Make the script ask:
echo "Enter path to backup:"
read PATH
tar -cvf backup.tar $PATH
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now I could run it for any directory.
👉 Lesson: Interactivity makes scripts versatile across environments.
5️⃣ Functions — The “Scattered Logging Mess”
Scenario: I had multiple scripts spitting logs in random formats. Debugging failures became a nightmare.
Solution: I created a reusable logging function:
log() {
echo "[INFO] $(date): $1"
}
log "Backup started"
log "Backup completed"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now all my scripts spoke the same language.
👉 Lesson: Functions bring consistency to messy automation.
6️⃣ Shell vs sh vs Bash — The “Works on Ubuntu, Breaks on Alpine” Problem
Scenario: A deployment script ran fine on Ubuntu but failed inside a lightweight Alpine Docker container.
The issue: Alpine used /bin/sh, which didn’t support certain Bash features.
Solution: Always specify the interpreter:
#!/bin/bash
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Explicit is better than implicit. Always define your shell.
7️⃣ Conditionals — The “Don’t Delete While Running” Disaster
Scenario: A cleanup script started wiping logs while nginx was still running. The service crashed.
Solution: Add a safety check:
if pgrep nginx; then
echo "Nginx running. Skipping cleanup."
else
rm -rf /var/log/nginx/*
fi
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Conditionals are the guardrails that keep automation safe.
8️⃣ Arguments — The “One Script Per Environment” Problem
Scenario: I had separate scripts for dev, test, and prod backups. Unmanageable.
Solution:
ENV=$1
echo "Backing up $ENV environment..."
tar -cvf backup_$ENV.tar /var/$ENV/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Run with:
./backup.sh dev
./backup.sh prod
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Arguments make scripts scale across environments.
9️⃣ Loops — The “50 Log Files” Problem
Scenario: Compressing logs one by one? Impossible during an outage.
Solution:
for file in /var/log/*.log; do
gzip $file
done
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
👉 Lesson: Loops are the ultimate time-savers for bulk operations.
🎭 The Advanced Turning Point: When My Script Nearly Wiped Production
Late one night, I was asked to “clean up temp files.” I rushed and wrote:
But I forgot my script was running as root inside a container mount. It began deleting critical shared files.
I pulled the brakes with Ctrl+C, but the damage was real — some mounted configs were gone.
How I Recovered:
Restored configs from backup.
Added dry-run safety in my scripts:
echo "Would delete: $file"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
before actually running rm.
Enforced set -e and logging for all critical scripts.
👉 Lesson: Scripts are scalpels — powerful, precise, and dangerous. Treat them with respect.
🌟 Key Takeaways from Part 5
Shell scripting concepts come alive only through real problems.
Variables, arguments, loops → not “syntax,” but solutions to DevOps pain.
Conditionals and functions prevent disasters.
Always test in a sandbox before production.
Scripts aren’t toys — they’re system lifelines.
🚀 What’s Next (Part 6: Networking Basics)
Now that I can script my way out of problems, the next step is to make sure systems can talk to each other.
In Part 6, I’ll explore:
Computer Networking Overview
OSI Model
LAN, Switch, Router, Subnet, Firewall
Cloud Networking
Microservices Networking
