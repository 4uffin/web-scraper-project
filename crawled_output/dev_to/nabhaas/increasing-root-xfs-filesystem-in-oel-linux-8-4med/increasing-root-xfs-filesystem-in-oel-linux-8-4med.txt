Increasing root ( "/" ) xfs filesystem in OEL Linux 8

NOTE : This does not work for OCI DB Systems or ExaCS , this is for On Premise servers only !!!
The root filesystem
In Oracle Linux 8 (OEL 8), the root filesystem (/) itself is usually kept lean. But depending on how partitions are laid out, some directories under / can grow large and become major space contributors.
This is probably a cake walk for SRE's and Sys Admins but for DBA's and developers this is a struggle.
Why and what contributes to its space increace
I recently had a situation where root was set up tp 20G for a small POC environment and I notes space was filling up , before we get to add space lets understand what root contains , a visual representation below.
/
├── bin
→ Essential user commands (ls, cp, mv, cat, bash)
├── sbin
→ System binaries for boot/recovery (fsck, systemctl, init)
├── lib
→ Shared libraries for /bin & /sbin
├── lib64
→ 64-bit shared libraries (mandatory in OEL 8)
├── etc
→ System config files (fstab, passwd, shadow, systemd)
├── root
→ Home directory for root user
├── dev
→ Device files (disks, terminals, /dev/null, /dev/console)
├── proc
→ Virtual filesystem for kernel & process info
├── sys
→ Sysfs virtual filesystem (kernel, devices, drivers)
├── tmp
→ Temporary directory (must exist, 1777 perms)
├── boot*
→ Kernel, initramfs, GRUB configs (*separate partition common)
│
├── usr (opt)
→ User apps, libraries, documentation (can be separate FS)
├── var (opt)

My Scenario
In my case I had a situotion as below where root was full in OEL 8. Now I need to identify three things Why What How
Where is my space increasing ?
Why is my space increasing ?
How can I move along from here ?
A representation of my findings are below

Where is my space increasing ?
In my case I had a 20G space in root and I used up 12GB in /usr , the reason for this is I have several Python modules installed which is installed in /usr
How is my space increasing ?
There are two main contributors.
a) All my system logging happens in /var , /var/log needs to be controlled.
b) If I keep installing more Python modules in /usr it would continue to grow.
Each Server has its software install needs so we need ot understand and size the root and other filesystems accordingly
How can I move along from here ?
Now we need ot understand from the pic above that root ( / ) is a xfs filesystem so we need to use the xfs methods to increase the space. By default in OEL8 xfs is the root filesystem partition.
How to add space to root filesystem
The following are needed
Add Physical Disks
Partition the added disks
Create physical volume on partitioned disk
Extend volume group
Extend the logical volume
Increase root space with xfs_grow
Step 1. Add Physical Disks
Once Physical Disks are added you should see a new disk added in my case /dev/sdc
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# lsblk

Step 2. Partition the added disks
Partition the disks using fdisk
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# fdisk /dev/sdc
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.32.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

(base) [root@machine1 ~]#

Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3. Create physical volume on partitioned disk
Use pvcreate to create the physical volme from the partition
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# pvcreate /dev/sdc1
Physical volume "/dev/sdc1" successfully created.
(base) [root@machine1 ~]#
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4. Extend volume group
Use vgextend to add the new PV to an existing Volume Group, making the space available to the VG.
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# lvdisplay /dev/mapper/ol-root
--- Logical volume ---
LV Path
/dev/ol/root

252:0
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# vgextend ol /dev/sdc1
Volume group "ol" successfully extended
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 5. Extend the logical volume
Use lvextend to allocate the newly available space from the VG to a specific Logical Volume. In mycase I use all available space in the volume to be added
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ol/root
Size of logical volume ol/root changed from <18.63 GiB (4769 extents) to <38.63 GiB (9889 extents).
Logical volume ol/root successfully resized.
(base) [root@machine1 ~]#
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 6. Increase root space with xfs_grow
Since my root is xfs I need to use xfs_grow to grow the root filesystem
(base) [root@machine1 ~]#
xfs_growfs -d /
meta-data=/dev/mapper/ol-root
isize=512

blocks=0, rtextents=0
data blocks changed from 4883456 to 10126336
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I can see my root file system in now increased to 40GB ( the 20gb disk was added )
Now lsblk shows sdc1 is added to ol-root
(base) [root@machine1 ~]# lsblk
