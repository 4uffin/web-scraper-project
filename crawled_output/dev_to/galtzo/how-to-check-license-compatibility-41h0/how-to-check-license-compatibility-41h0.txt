Other posts in my Compatibility Matrix Series
ActiveRecord / SQlite3 Compatibility Matrix
RRRRb Matrix (Ruby, RubyGems, RuboCop, Rails, Bundler)
You have a project made out of code, sprinkles, and spice, and you want to validate compatibility between your project's license and the licenses of its dependencies, as defined by:
Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Categorizations via apache.org
Free Software Foundation's (FSF) Free/Libre designations via spdx.org
Open Source Initiative (OSI) Approved designations via spdx.org
Any of the above
What is Compatible?
Apache Software Foundation
IANAL, but Apache Software Foundation has resolved many legal issues between licenses and determined their compatibility to my satisfaction. Take it up with them if your fractious children want to quarrel about it.
Category A licenses are compatible with each other and with Apache Software Foundation projects generally.
Category B licenses are compatible with each other, and with Apache Software Foundation projects when included as binary code.
Other licenses need manual validation, and compatibility can be configured and documented per project.
These categorizations are the backbone of the license checker, see further down for a configuration example.
FSF Free/Libre
Supported. In your licenserc.yaml:
dependency:
require_fsf_free: true # will only consider compatible if license is FSF Free/Libre; default false
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
OSI Approved
Supported. In your licenserc.yaml:
dependency:
require_osi_approved: true # will only consider compatible if license is OSI Approved; default false
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How can we check compatibility?
I've now pushed many PRs to a project called Apache SkyWalking Eyes (#205, #207, #208, #209, ... #247, #248, #249, #250). And now it is ready to write about.
It works for a basic use case of a project with MIT and Ruby licensed dependencies, such as oauth2:
https://github.com/ruby-oauth/oauth2/pull/676
It also works for more complex use cases with many dependencies across a broad set of open source licenses.
Project Setup
This example will use a Ruby project as an example, but there is support for Create two files:
# .licenserc.yaml
header:
license:
spdx-id: MIT # The license of your project!
dependency:
require_fsf_free: false # if "FSF Free/Libre" is required, set to true
require_osi_approved: false # if "OSI Approved" is required, set to true
files:
- Gemfile.lock
# If this is a Ruby project (Bundler). Ensure Gemfile.lock is committed.
# - pom.xml
# If this is a maven project.
# - Cargo.toml
# If this is a rust project.
# - package.json
# If this is a npm project.
# - go.mod
# If this is a Go project.

and
# .github/workflows/license-eye.yml
name: Apache SkyWalking Eyes
permissions:
contents: read
on:
push:
branches:
- 'main'
- '*-stable'
tags:
- '!*' # Do not execute on tags
pull_request:
branches:
- '*'
# Allow manually triggering the workflow.
workflow_dispatch:
# Cancels all previous workflow runs for the same branch that have not yet completed.

# The concurrency group contains the workflow name and the branch name.
group: "${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}"
cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
license-check:
if: "!contains(github.event.commits[0].message, '[ci skip]') && !contains(github.event.commits[0].message, '[skip ci]')"
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout
uses: actions/checkout@v5
- name: Check Dependencies' License
uses: apache/skywalking-eyes/dependency@main
with:
config: .licenserc.yaml
# Ruby packages declared as dependencies in gemspecs or Gemfiles are
#
typically consumed as binaries; enable weak-compatibility
#
so permissive and weak-copyleft combinations are treated as compatible.
flags: --weak-compatible
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Result
End result workflow runs look like:
https://github.com/ruby-oauth/oauth2/actions/workflows/license-eye.yml
Experiment: if we mark the Ruby license (which is category B) as incompatible in our MIT (category A) projects, this is what would happen:
Cool, right?
I'm not suggesting you do that, since in Ruby dependencies are normally included as binaries, so Category B is generally compatible with Category A licenses in Ruby projects...
Projects that declare no license are problematic and will fail in this same way, alerting you to the problem.
You'll also get notified if downstream dependencies change their licenses to something incompatible.
Spread Awareness
Because licenses matter...
Now is a good time to make your community of users aware of your shiny license compliance via README.md badges...
