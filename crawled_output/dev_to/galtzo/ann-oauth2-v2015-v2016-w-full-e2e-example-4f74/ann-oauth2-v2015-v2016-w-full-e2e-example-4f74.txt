Actually Instagram compatibility came in oauth2 v2.0.15, but I didn't make a separate post about it. So here's what you need to know:
verb-dependent token transmission mode for AccessToken makes it Instagram compatible.
Complete example included!
OK, now on with v2.0.16!
Complete E2E single file script
runs against navikt/mock-oauth2-server
E2E script in source
NOTE: The mock test server was added to source in oauth v2.0.11, and has now been upgraded to the latest version of mock-oauth2-server. The mock test server is not in the packaged gem.
docker compose -f docker-compose-ssl.yml up -d --wait
ruby examples/e2e.rb
# If your machine is slow or Docker pulls are cold, increase the wait:
E2E_WAIT_TIMEOUT=120 ruby examples/e2e.rb
# The mock server serves HTTP on 8080; the example points to http://localhost:8080 by default.
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The output should be something like this:
‚ûú
ruby examples/e2e.rb
Access token (truncated): eyJraWQiOiJkZWZhdWx0...
userinfo status: 200
userinfo body: {"sub" => "demo-sub", "aud" => ["demo-aud"], "nbf" => 1757816758000, "iss" => "http://localhost:8080/default", "exp" => 1757820358000, "iat" => 1757816758000, "jti" => "d63b97a7-ebe5-4dea-93e6-d542caba6104"}
E2E complete
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Make sure to shut down the mock server when you are done:
docker compose -f docker-compose-ssl.yml down
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Troubleshooting: validate connectivity to the mock server
Check container status and port mapping:
docker compose -f docker-compose-ssl.yml ps
From the host, try the discovery URL directly (this is what the example uses by default):
curl -v http://localhost:8080/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
If that fails immediately, also try: curl -v --connect-timeout 2 http://127.0.0.1:8080/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
From inside the container (to distinguish container vs host networking):
docker exec -it oauth2-mock-oauth2-server-1 curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
Simple TCP probe from the host:
nc -vz localhost 8080
# or: ruby -rsocket -e 'TCPSocket.new("localhost",8080).close; puts "tcp ok"'
Inspect which host port 8080 is bound to (should be 8080):
docker inspect -f '{{ (index (index .NetworkSettings.Ports "8080/tcp") 0).HostPort }}' oauth2-mock-oauth2-server-1
Look at server logs for readiness/errors:
docker logs -n 200 oauth2-mock-oauth2-server-1
On Linux, ensure nothing else is bound to 8080 and that firewall/SELinux aren‚Äôt blocking:
ss -ltnp | grep :8080
Notes
Discovery URL pattern is: http://localhost:8080//.well-known/openid-configuration, where
defaults to "default".
You can change these with env vars when running the example:
E2E_ISSUER_BASE (default: http://localhost:8080)
E2E_REALM (default: default)
See the full changelogs after a word from (or is it for?) my sponsor (you!).
