How to Use AI to Plan and Run Better Meetings
#ai

Most people don‚Äôt hate work ‚Äî they hate bad meetings.
Too long, too vague, and often unnecessary.
The good news? AI can make meetings shorter, sharper, and more productive.
Here‚Äôs how I use AI to plan, run, and follow up on meetings that actually move things forward.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Plan the Agenda in Minutes
Instead of spending hours drafting, let AI build the first version.
üí° Prompt Example:
‚ÄúYou are an operations manager. Draft a 5-point agenda for a 30-minute team meeting about improving customer support efficiency. Include timings.‚Äù
Why: Everyone comes prepared. The meeting has a structure before it begins.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Summarise Pre-Reads
Instead of sharing 20-page docs, use AI to generate concise summaries.
üí° Prompt Example:
‚ÄúSummarise this report into 5 bullet points and 2 discussion questions for the team.‚Äù
Why: Attendees can scan the essentials, not drown in details.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Keep Meetings on Track
AI can act as a facilitator by tracking time, capturing notes, or flagging when the discussion drifts.
üìå Tools I‚Äôve tested: Otter.ai, Fireflies, and Tiledesk integrations.
These transcribe and summarise in real-time, so participants stay engaged.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Capture Action Items Automatically
üí° Prompt Example:
‚ÄúFrom this transcript, list all action items, assign them to participants, and set deadlines.‚Äù
Why: Nobody leaves confused about next steps.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Send Instant Follow-Ups
AI drafts polished meeting notes that you can send within minutes.
üí° Prompt Example:
‚ÄúWrite a professional follow-up email summarizing today‚Äôs meeting on [topic]. Include agenda, outcomes, and assigned tasks.‚Äù
Why: Reinforces accountability and saves you time.
Why This Works
Meetings start with clarity
Discussions stay focused
Follow-ups drive action
Instead of meetings draining energy, AI transforms them into decision-making engines.

Plug-and-play prompt systems (free & paid) ‚Üí ReThynk AI Templates & Frameworks
Professional AI, business, and tech insights (currently free on our website) ‚Üí ReThynk AI Magazine
Final Thought
Bad meetings waste time.
AI-powered meetings create momentum.
If you run even one meeting a week, start small: let AI plan the agenda, summarise, or draft the follow-up. You‚Äôll notice the difference immediately.

Most developers avoid unit testing, despite its importance. Now, there is no need to avoid unit testing, as it becomes easy and fast with AI.

Code reviews are no longer just about human bandwidth. Think of AI not as replacing peer reviews, but as a first-pass reviewer that saves time and raises quality.
