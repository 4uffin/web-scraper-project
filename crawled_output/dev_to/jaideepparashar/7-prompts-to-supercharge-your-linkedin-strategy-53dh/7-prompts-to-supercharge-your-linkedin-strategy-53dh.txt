7 Prompts to Supercharge Your LinkedIn Strategy
#ai
#beginners
#webdev
#discuss
In 2025, I have 65k followers on LinkedIn and 30,000 subscribers to my newsletter, and I drive my maximum business from LinkedIn.
So, if you‚Äôre not building your brand on LinkedIn in 2025, you‚Äôre leaving opportunities on the table.
It‚Äôs no longer just a job board ‚Äî it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest professional stage.
And with AI, you don‚Äôt need a content team to shine.
Here are 7 plug-and-play prompts I personally use to grow, engage, and build trust on LinkedIn.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Profile Optimization
Why: Your profile is your digital handshake. Make it memorable.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúYou are a LinkedIn branding expert. Rewrite my profile headline and summary to position me as an AI strategist and author. Keep it under 300 words and make it professional yet approachable.‚Äù
2Ô∏è‚É£ Content Calendar
Why: Consistency builds trust.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúCreate a 30-day LinkedIn content plan for an entrepreneur in the AI space. Include post ideas for thought leadership, storytelling, client case studies, and tips.‚Äù
3Ô∏è‚É£ Storytelling Posts
Why: Stories connect more than stats.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúWrite a LinkedIn post sharing my journey of leaving a secure job to build an AI-first company. Keep it under 200 words, authentic, and end with a lesson for professionals.‚Äù
4Ô∏è‚É£ Thought Leadership
Why: Thought leadership = influence + authority.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúWrite a LinkedIn post explaining why prompt engineering is the new literacy. Keep it clear, thought-provoking, and under 220 words.‚Äù
5Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement Boosters
Why: Engagement fuels visibility.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúDraft 5 LinkedIn poll ideas about AI in business. Make them thought-provoking and easy to answer.‚Äù
6Ô∏è‚É£ Comment Like a Pro
Why: Visibility doesn‚Äôt only come from posting ‚Äî it comes from joining conversations.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúGenerate 10 thoughtful comment ideas I can post under AI-related LinkedIn posts to add value, not spam. Keep each under 50 words.‚Äù
7Ô∏è‚É£ Networking Outreach
Why: Relationships scale faster when outreach feels genuine.
üí° Prompt:
‚ÄúWrite a personalized LinkedIn connection request for a CTO of a mid-size SaaS company. Mention our shared interest in AI and offer value through collaboration.‚Äù
Final Thought
Your LinkedIn strategy isn‚Äôt about posting more ‚Äî it‚Äôs about posting smarter.
With the right prompts, you can:
Clarify your brand
Show thought leadership
Build a network that opens doors
Resources to Elevate Your LinkedIn
