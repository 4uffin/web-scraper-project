Building Why Should I Care (WSIC) - An ed-tech social media app with Kiro

How I built ‚ÄúWhy Should I Care‚Äù in 3 weeks with Kiro
Intro
In an age where information is everywhere but meaning is hard to find, WSIC (Why Should I Care) aims to be more than just another content platform. It‚Äôs a learning engine: one that can turn any topic ‚Äî no matter how obscure ‚Äî into a polished, interactive educational experience.
In just three weeks, using Kiro, Amazon‚Äôs new AI-powered IDE, I built a working version of WSIC. Along the way, I discovered how Kiro‚Äôs unique features ‚Äî like Spec Driven Development, Agent Steering, MCP, Agent Hooks, and Vibe Mode ‚Äî can fundamentally change the way developers build.

What is WSIC
WSIC is an innovative educational platform that helps users discover interesting topics. Using advanced multi AI agent architecture and intelligent search, the platform creates comprehensive, interactive learning modules on-demand, making even the most obscure subjects accessible and engaging.
üéØ Key Features
ü§ñ AI-Powered Content Generation
Multi-Agent System: 8 specialized AI agents create comprehensive educational content
On-Demand Learning: Generate complete learning modules for any topic in 3-4 minutes
Fact-Checked Content: Fact checked and enriched web content using Exa API
Real-World Connections: Links topics to real-world and practical applications
üîç Advanced Search System
Dual Search Strategy: Combines text search with semantic vector search
Google Gemini Embeddings: 768-dimensional vectors for contextual understanding
Smart Results: High-relevance similar topics promoted alongside exact matches
Instant Discovery: Find existing content or trigger new content creation
üìö Comprehensive Learning Modules
Research Briefs: Foundational and deep-dive information
Interactive Quizzes and Reorder: Multiple choice and reorder activities
Flash Cards: Key concepts for quick review
Real-World Impact: Current relevance and applications
Visual Content: AI-selected thumbnails and rich media
üé® Modern User Experience
Glassmorphism Design: Beautiful, modern interface with backdrop blur effects
Responsive Layout: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Real-Time Updates: Live notifications and content synchronization
Personalized Dashboard: Track topic metrics and saved content
How Kiro Helped Me Ship in 3 Weeks
Kiro isn‚Äôt just an IDE ‚Äî it‚Äôs a developer co-pilot with powerful features that fit perfectly into WSIC‚Äôs build process.
Spec Driven Development
When I had the initial idea for WSIC, I used Kiro‚Äôs Spec Driven Development to lay out the complete plan. This helped me:
Define the architecture up front.
Generate boilerplate code aligned with the spec.
Ensure consistency in API design and frontend structure from the start.
This upfront clarity saved me countless hours later.
Agent Steering
As I expanded the codebase, Agent Steering ensured that:
UI consistency was maintained.
Coding style didn‚Äôt deviate when new agents generated code.
Refactors didn‚Äôt spiral into stylistic mismatches.
This feature was especially valuable for maintaining polish across the app in a short timeframe.
MCP (Model Context Protocol)
I used MCP to connect Kiro directly with Convex DB for testing.
This allowed me to:
Experiment with real data flows early.
Validate search and user sessions in a staging environment.
Avoid messy local hacks during prototyping.
Agent Hooks
Kiro‚Äôs Agent Hooks turned into my documentation engine. By setting hooks during development, I automatically generated:
Comprehensive technical docs.
Explanations of key flows (like the content generation pipeline).
Onboarding guides for contributors.
Vibe Mode
Out of all Kiro features, the one I used the most was Vibe Mode.
I used it so heavily that I even hit overages on the Pro plan.
But it was worth it: vibe mode paired with Claude 4 generated the cleanest, most reliable code I‚Äôve ever seen in an IDE.
On average, I was able to ship mid-complex features in just 7‚Äì8 iterations.
The most impressive moment?
I developed the Search Page ‚Äî the main part of the app ‚Äî in just 10‚Äì11 iterations on the very last day of the hackathon. It worked beautifully.
What I Liked About Kiro
Unique Features: The combination of agent steering, hooks, spec-driven dev, and MCP provided use cases no other IDE currently offers. It wasn‚Äôt just about code generation ‚Äî it was about orchestrating the entire build lifecycle.
Code Quality: Compared to other AI IDEs, Kiro‚Äôs output was consistently better. I could get solid, mid-complex features ready in under 10 iterations, which drastically reduced dev time.
Developer Flow: The IDE felt like it understood how I wanted to build, not just what I wanted to code.
What Kiro Could Improve
Multi-Model Architecture: Supporting multiple models for different stages would be a game-changer.
Example: Gemini for requirement gathering, Claude for coding, OpenAI models for docs/tests.
Code Understanding: Sometimes the model would generate unnecessary code for features that already existed elsewhere in the project.
A higher-level understanding of the codebase could reduce duplication and make the agent even smarter.

Closing Thoughts
Building WSIC in three weeks was ambitious ‚Äî but Kiro made it possible.
Its spec-driven foundation, agent steering for consistency, MCP for DB testing, agent hooks for documentation, and above all vibe mode with Claude 4 gave me the tools to go from an idea to a working MVP in record time.
The result wasn‚Äôt just another hackathon project ‚Äî it was a glimpse into how the future of development might look: collaborative, spec-driven, multi-agent, and powered by the best AI models.
