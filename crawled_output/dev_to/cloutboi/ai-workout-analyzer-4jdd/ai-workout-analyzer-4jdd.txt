Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
I built a multimodal workout coach that takes in a video of your exercise, analyzes it, and gives you actionable feedback. When you submit a clip, the system does three things:
Global Review ‚Äì it highlights overall issues in your form.
Rep-by-Rep Analysis ‚Äì each repetition gets tagged with faults, coaching cues, and suggestions.
AI-Powered Correction ‚Äì instead of just telling you what‚Äôs wrong, the app uses generative AI to fix your form in the video, showing you the corrected version of yourself performing the movement properly.
The end result is like having a personal trainer who not only points out mistakes but also shows you exactly how to move better.

How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio to power the core of my workout analysis pipeline. Specifically, I used:
gemini-2.5-pro for the heavy lifting on video understanding and structured feedback generation. This model analyzed each submitted workout video, segmented reps, flagged faults, and produced a JSON schema with both rep-level details and global coaching advice.
gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview for visual correction previews. After faults were identified, I passed frames through this model to generate a corrected version of the user‚Äôs form ‚Äî so instead of just text feedback, users could actually see themselves performing the exercise properly.
Multimodal Features
The core of this project relies on multimodal capabilities ‚Äî combining video, image, and text understanding to create a more complete coaching experience.
Video Analysis ‚Äì Gemini processes full workout videos, breaking them into reps, detecting faults, and generating structured JSON with rep-level insights.
Image-Based Corrections ‚Äì Key frames are re-rendered with improved posture, letting users visually compare their original form to the corrected version of themselves.
Text Feedback ‚Äì Alongside visuals, the system provides global coaching notes and rep-by-rep suggestions in clear, human-friendly language.
