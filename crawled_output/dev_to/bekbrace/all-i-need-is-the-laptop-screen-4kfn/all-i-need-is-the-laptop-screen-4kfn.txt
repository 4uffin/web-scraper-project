Why I Ditched the Second Monitor
What follows is purely personal—your setup might be perfect for you. But if any of this resonates, I’d be glad.
My studio is a 30-square-meter space in the heart of Łódź, Poland. For five years I’ve been building projects, recording tutorials, and designing courses with a big external monitor paired to my laptop. It felt efficient—until I noticed something odd.
I wasn’t coding so much as transcribing. I’d park my script or reference code on the second screen and spend entire sessions swivelling my head left to right thirty-plus times a minute, copying line after line. If that second screen went dark, I’d panic. My own thinking slowed.
The dependence started to feel like the way we lean on AI tools. A calculator helps with a complex equation, sure, but it doesn’t replace understanding. ChatGPT can be a spark, not a stand-in. My extra monitor had become a stand-in.
Last week I unplugged it. Now it’s just me and the laptop. Notes live on an iPad or a sheet of paper when I need them. And something shifted: I write from memory, plan in my head, and feel my brain working instead of my eyes darting. The simple act of getting stuck—sitting with a problem—feels good again.
This isn’t the first time I’ve been reminded that the hard way matters. From 2009 to 2011 I worked for a Japanese company in Algeria. One day I made a tiny mistake—an extra dot on a document. My manager, Yuki Takahashi (“Yuki” means snow in Japanese), looked at me and said:
“Amir-san, don’t take the easy way. Perfect what you can. The easy way is bad; the hard way pays off.”
Those words never left me. Shortcuts can feed you like junk food: satisfying now, costly later.
So here I am, back to a single screen. It’s slower, and that’s the point.
How about you? Do you thrive with a wall of monitors, or does less help you think more?
Thanks for reading—stay safe, and see you next time.

This is such an interesting read, I've never thought of the second monitor in that way.
I think I like the second monitor as a way to monitor chat messages. But perhaps that could be a distraction at times too, taking away from us getting into deep work.
Don't know if I'm brave enough to get rid of the second screen just yet, but defiantly has me thinking of ways to improve my workspace.

Less is more. Two screens is way too distracting. Laptop screen and e-ink tablet for notes is my setup. Super happy with it. Much more focused.
