Beyond `text-wrap: pretty` — language-aware line breaks for minor words
#css

#webdev
#i18n
Ever noticed that tiny “a” dangling at the end of a headline? 😱
text-wrap: pretty already makes paragraphs look smarter — but it isn’t language-aware. In many editorial traditions, you don’t want to break after minor words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions), or between an honorific and the following name, or between initials and a surname.
This post proposes a small, language-aware upgrade to line breaking — and ships a tiny polyfill you can try in 30 seconds.
CodePen: https://codepen.io/jlorenzetti/pen/zxvXewX
TL;DR
text-wrap: pretty improves line breaks, but it’s not language-aware.
This tiny polyfill adds a thin layer of editorial glue: keeps obvious pairs together (e.g. Mr. Smith, Fig. 2, 20 °C, 1900–2000, J. K. Rowling) and optionally keeps minor words attached to the next word where that’s the editorial norm.
Zero deps, one DOM pass, no layout measurements.
Try the live demo
What pretty solves — and what it can’t
text-wrap: pretty focuses on avoiding short last lines and can make smarter break choices near the end of a paragraph (details vary by engine).
But it’s agnostic about editorial semantics — it doesn’t know that Fig. and 2 belong together, or that many editorial traditions avoid breaking after short function words.
This polyfill adds just enough semantics on top of pretty, without re-implementing layout. Think of it as one layer of “do not break here” for well-established editorial conventions.
The upgrade in one minute
Scope: only elements whose computed text-wrap is pretty.
Scan: a single pass over text nodes (no layout reads, no reflows).
Decide: match language-aware patterns:
Safe rules (always on): honorifics + name, initials + surname, label + number, number + unit, § + number, numeric ranges (WORD JOINER around the dash).
Minor words (per locale): attach short function words only where this is a common editorial convention.
Glue: replace a normal space with NBSP (U+00A0) or insert WORD JOINER (U+2060) where appropriate.
Idempotent & safe: skips URLs/emails, doesn’t cross inline elements by default, doesn’t touch pre/code/....
Quick start
Plain HTML (no build)
<article class="typo" lang="en">
<p>See Fig. 2 for details.</p>
</article>
<style>
.typo { text-wrap: pretty; hyphens: auto; }
/* Older UAs without `text-wrap: pretty`: opt-in to the glue layer */
@supports not (text-wrap: pretty) {
.typo { --text-wrap-preferences: minor-words; }
}
</style>
<script type="module">
import { init, registerLanguage } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/text-wrap-minor-words@0.3.1/dist/lite.mjs';
import en from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/text-wrap-minor-words@0.3.1/locales/en.json' assert { type: 'json' };
registerLanguage('en', en);
const ctrl = init({ languages: ['en'] });
ctrl.process();
</script>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Swap en for another locale if needed. To support multiple locales, import/register more JSON files the same way.
Node / bundler (ESM)
npm i text-wrap-minor-words
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
import { init, registerLanguage } from 'text-wrap-minor-words/lite';
import en from 'text-wrap-minor-words/locales/en.json';
registerLanguage('en', en);
const ctrl = init({ languages: ['en'], observe: true });
ctrl.process();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
<style>
.typo { text-wrap: pretty; hyphens: auto; }
@supports not (text-wrap: pretty) {
.typo { --text-wrap-preferences: minor-words; }
}
</style>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You can also load the non-lite global build:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/text-wrap-minor-words@0.3.1/dist/index.global.js"></script> (includes built-in locale data for quick trials; prefer lite in production).
English display opt-in (optional)
By default, minor words are off for English body text. This snippet enables them only in display contexts (headings).
Plain HTML (no build)
<article class="typo" lang="en">
<h1>From a book to the browser: a practical guide to typography on the web</h1>
</article>
<style>
.typo { text-wrap: pretty; hyphens: auto; }
/* Enable the minor-words glue only for English headings (display) */
.typo :is(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6):lang(en) {
--text-wrap-preferences: minor-words; /* gate on */
--text-wrap-minor-threshold: 1; /* glue after 1-char tokens */
--text-wrap-minor-stoplist: "of to in on at for by a I"; /* adjust to your style guide */
}
@supports not (text-wrap: pretty) {
.typo { --text-wrap-preferences: minor-words; }
}
</style>
<script type="module">
import { init, registerLanguage } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/text-wrap-minor-words@0.3.1/dist/lite.mjs';
import en from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/text-wrap-minor-words@0.3.1/locales/en.json' assert { type: 'json' };
registerLanguage('en', en);
const ctrl = init({ languages: ['en'], context: 'display' }); // limit processing to display contexts
ctrl.process();
</script>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Bundler / ESM
npm i text-wrap-minor-words
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
import { init, registerLanguage } from 'text-wrap-minor-words/lite';
import en from 'text-wrap-minor-words/locales/en.json';
registerLanguage('en', en);
const ctrl = init({ languages: ['en'], context: 'display' });
ctrl.process();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
.typo { text-wrap: pretty; hyphens: auto; }
.typo :is(h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6):lang(en) {
--text-wrap-preferences: minor-words;
--text-wrap-minor-threshold: 1;
--text-wrap-minor-stoplist: "of to in on at for by a I";
}
@supports not (text-wrap: pretty) {
.typo { --text-wrap-preferences: minor-words; }
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Tip: prefer :lang(en) over [lang="en"] so headings match the language inherited from the container.
Defaults & language notes (compact)
Safe rules (on in every language): honorifics + name (Mr. Smith, Dr. Müller), initials + surname (J. K. Rowling), label + number (Fig. 2, S. 12), number + unit (20 °C, 10 km), § + number, numeric ranges (1900–2000 with U+2060 around the dash).
Minor words: on by default in Romance/Slavic/Greek; off by default in English/German/Dutch (you can opt-in for display).
Locale
1-letter glue

Performance & accessibility
O(n) over text nodes. Regex pre-compiled per locale. No layout measurements.
Early exit for neutral locales (e.g. en/de/nl when minor words are off).
Screen readers: NBSP/WORD JOINER are invisible to AT; URL/email detection prevents accidental glue.
Caveats
Inline crossing: currently we don’t cross inline elements (e.g. a <em>word</em>). We may evaluate a future opt-in.
CJK/RTL: not targeted for now (different line-breaking traditions).
Not a grammar rule: this encodes editorial conventions, not linguistic rules. Defaults are conservative; override when your style guide differs.
Spec angle (why this might belong in CSS)
This polyfill explores a small, language-aware extension to text-wrap. If real-world use proves it broadly useful and low-risk, one possible shape could be a dedicated option (e.g. a “minor-words” sub-mode) that lets UAs apply these low-controversy “do not break here” hints.
The repo includes an explainer with non-goals, locale data, and tests. If you have production samples or edge cases, please share them — they’re exactly what a future proposal needs.

I don't have an immediate use case, but DAMN I love this post. I love NLP this totally counts as micro-NLP; I'd be most interested to see what kind of edge cases you find. Wild article. Well done.

Thanks Ryan! 🙏 I’ll take “micro-NLP”! That’s exactly the idea: just enough language awareness to fix common typographic cases.

If you try this, I'd love your feedback and edge cases — especially for English display and new locales. Screenshots welcome!
