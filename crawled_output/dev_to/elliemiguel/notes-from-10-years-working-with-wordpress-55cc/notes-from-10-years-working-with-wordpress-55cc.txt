Notes from 10+ years working with WordPress
#wordpress

I started freelancing with WordPress in 2010.
Back then, the ecosystem was simpler: fewer plugins, fewer builders, fewer expectations.
Over the years, both the platform and the projects have grown — and so have the mistakes, lessons, and small habits that make the work sustainable.
These are a few notes from more than a decade building sites for real clients.
1. Less is more (and always has been)
The temptation to install plugins for everything is strong.
But every extra plugin is extra code, extra queries, and extra updates.
The projects that survive are the ones built lean. My stack rarely changes: WordPress, Elementor Pro, JetEngine, WP Rocket, and a solid forms plugin. With those, I can cover 90% of use cases without bloat.
2. Good hosting solves half your problems
A bad host can make even a well-built site feel broken.
Slow servers, outdated PHP versions, or poor support waste hours of your time.
Paying more for reliable hosting is not a luxury — it’s insurance. Good hosting makes sites faster, more secure, and easier to maintain. It also means fewer panicked emails from clients at midnight.
3. SEO basics are more powerful than SEO tricks
Meta titles, descriptions, clean permalinks, alt text, heading hierarchy — these boring basics carry more weight than endless keyword stuffing or paid “SEO hacks.”
A well-structured site that loads quickly, uses clear URLs, and organizes content logically will naturally perform better than a messy site chasing trends.
4. Clients want clarity, not complexity
A site that looks good but confuses the client in the backend will not last.
Simplify dashboards, name fields clearly, and document how things work.
If a client feels confident updating their own content, they’ll keep the site alive. If not, they’ll abandon it.
Building with Elementor + JetEngine gives me the flexibility to create dynamic content, but also keep the backend friendly.
5. A site is never “done”
The web is living. Plugins update, browsers change, designs evolve.
The projects that last are the ones maintained consistently.
Set expectations early: there will be updates, checkups, and fixes. That’s not a failure of the platform — it’s part of the job.
A little routine maintenance prevents big headaches later.
Closing note
After 10+ years, the pattern is clear: WordPress works best when you keep it lean, structured, and maintained with care.
There are no shortcuts, but there are habits that make the work lighter and the sites stronger.
