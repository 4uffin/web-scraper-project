Getting Started with Coder.com

Introduction
In today’s cloud-native world, developer productivity is often limited by the complexity of local development environments. Setting up tools, dependencies, and resources can be time-consuming and inconsistent across teams. That’s where Coder.com comes in.
Coder provides a way to run developer environments remotely, allowing engineers to code from anywhere while maintaining security, scalability, and reproducibility. Recently, I performed a Proof of Concept (POC) using Coder.com, and in this blog, I’ll share my experience, learnings, and key takeaways.
Why Coder.com?
Traditional development setups often face challenges like:
Inconsistent environments across machines
Long onboarding times for new developers
Security concerns when code resides on laptops
Scalability issues when projects demand more compute power
To address these issues, I explored Coder.com, a platform that enables cloud-hosted, reproducible developer workspaces. Recently, I ran a Proof of Concept (POC) to evaluate how Coder fits into a real-world setup. This blog walks you through my installation, configuration, and learnings.
Step 1: Install Dependencies
I began with a clean Ubuntu server. First, I updated the system and installed required utilities:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl unzip
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: Install Coder
I fetched the latest release of Coder from GitHub and installed it:
CODER_VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/coder/coder/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f 4 | sed 's/v//')
curl -fSL "https://github.com/coder/coder/releases/download/v${CODER_VERSION}/coder_${CODER_VERSION}_linux_amd64.deb" -o coder.deb
sudo apt install ./coder.deb
coder --version
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Install Docker
Coder requires Docker for container-based workspaces, so I installed and enabled it:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
docker ps
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I also added my user (ubuntu) to the Docker group for permissions:
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Run Coder Server
Once Docker was ready, I launched the Coder server:
coder server
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
To make Coder run as a service, I created a systemd service unit:
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/coder.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Coder service
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/coder server
Restart=always
User=ubuntu
Environment=CODER_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7080
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then reloaded and enabled it:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable coder
sudo systemctl start coder
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Finally, I opened port 7080 on the server and accessed the Coder dashboard at:
http://<server-ip>:7080
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Once you access the UI, we need to create admin user first.
Step 5: Play with Coder UI
I have used the built-in Docker Template to Create a Workspace
From the Coder dashboard, I selected the Docker template to spin up a workspace.
This template allowed me to quickly create a development container running on my server.
I have created a new user and assign him the member role and he can easily access my templates.
Step 6: Create Custom template
Coder integrates natively with Terraform. I have ssh into my ubuntu machine and created a main.tf file to define a simple workspace template:
terraform {
required_providers {
coder = {
source
= "coder/coder"
version = "0.15.0"
}
}
}
provider "coder" {}
resource "coder_agent" "dev" {
arch = "amd64"
os
= "linux"
startup_script = <<EOT
#!/bin/bash
set -e
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip git curl vim
EOT
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I initialized Terraform and pushed the template to Coder:
terraform init
coder templates push my-ubuntu-template
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now, in the Coder dashboard, I can see my custom template.
✅ Final Thoughts
This POC with Coder.com gave me a solid understanding of how remote developer environments can simplify onboarding, improve consistency, and enhance security. By testing both the Docker template and Terraform-based custom templates, I was able to validate that Coder is flexible enough to support simple as well as advanced use cases.
