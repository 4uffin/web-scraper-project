The Hack Club slack is goin' down. ðŸ˜ž
#discuss
Salesforce called the HackClub, a nonprofit that gives teens a comunnity and resources to code, and told them that they have two days to either
Increase the amount of money paid for hosting by 400%
or
Leave slack.
This is a travesty, as HackClub has used slack for over 11 years! They now have to export and transfer 11 years of work over to a self-hosted Matterhost instance. This is yet another example of megacorporations distancing themself from the people who rely on them. Salesforce just scarred THOUSANDS of slackbot devs for life. Here are some ways you could help if you want to:
NOT use slack, use discord or Matterhost.
Donate here!
