How Data is Stored in Kafka: JSON vs Avro Explained

If you‚Äôre new to Kafka, you‚Äôve probably asked yourself:
‚ÄúWhen a producer sends a record, what does Kafka actually store on disk? Is it JSON? Avro? Hex? Bytes??‚Äù
I recently went down this rabbit hole myself ‚Äî so here‚Äôs a breakdown of what really happens behind the scenes.
First Principles: Kafka Stores Bytes
Let‚Äôs clear the air first:
Kafka doesn‚Äôt know or care about JSON, Avro, Protobuf, POJOs, or unicorns ü¶Ñ.
It only deals in byte arrays (byte[]).
Producer sends: byte[] key, byte[] value
Broker writes to log: byte[]
Consumer reads: byte[]
Everything else (JSON, Avro, Protobuf, String) is just a serialization format layered on top.
Serialization vs Encoding
Two words that get thrown around a lot:
Serialization = turning an in-memory object (like a Java POJO) into a storable/transmittable format.
Encoding = mapping characters into bytes (e.g., UTF-8 for text).
üëâ JSON uses both. Avro is pure serialization.
How is data actually stored
Case 1: JSON in Kafka
Imagine a Java POJO: User{name="Lucky", age=30}
Steps
Serialize to JSON string
{
"name":"Lucky",
"age":30
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Encode string in UTF-8 ‚Üí bytes
[0x7B, 0x22, 0x6E, 0x61, ...]
(In hex: 7B 22 6E 61 6D 65 22 3A 22 4C )
Producer sends the above byte[] to Kafka.
Kafka stores raw bytes in its log
When you xxd the Kafka log file, you‚Äôll see that hex dump.
üëâÔ∏è Takeaway
JSON ‚Üí text ‚Üí UTF-8 encoding ‚Üí bytes ‚Üí Kafka.
It‚Äôs human-readable but bulky and slower to parse.
Case 2: Avro in Kafka
Same POJO: User{name="Lucky", age=30}
Steps
Serialize directly to Avro binary format
Field values are encoded as compact bytes following the Avro schema.
Example output (simplified):
[0x08, 0x4C, 0x75, 0x63, 0x6B, 0x79, 0x3C]
Producer sends byte[] to Kafka
Kafka stores raw bytes in its log
No intermediate ‚Äústring‚Äù or UTF-8 step.
üëâÔ∏è Takeaway
Avro ‚Üí compact binary ‚Üí bytes ‚Üí Kafka.
It‚Äôs efficient, schema-driven, and faster to deserialize.
JSON vs Avro: Side-by-Side
Step
JSON
Avro
Serialization
POJO ‚Üí JSON text
POJO ‚Üí Avro binary
Encoding
UTF-8 needed (text ‚Üí bytes)
Not needed (already binary)
Size
Larger (e.g., {"name":"Lucky"})
Smaller, compact
Readability
Human-readable
Not human-readable
Schema enforcement
Optional
Strict (via Avro schema)
Wrap-Up
When people ask ‚ÄúDoes Kafka store JSON or Avro?‚Äù, the real answer is:
üëâ Neither. Kafka stores raw bytes.
üëâ JSON/Avro/Protobuf are just contracts between producer and consumer.
So next time you see a Kafka hex dump like:
7B 22 6E 61 6D 65 22 3A 22 4C 75 63 6B 79 22 7D
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know: that‚Äôs just your data, encoded and serialized, resting in Kafka‚Äôs logs waiting for the next consumer.
