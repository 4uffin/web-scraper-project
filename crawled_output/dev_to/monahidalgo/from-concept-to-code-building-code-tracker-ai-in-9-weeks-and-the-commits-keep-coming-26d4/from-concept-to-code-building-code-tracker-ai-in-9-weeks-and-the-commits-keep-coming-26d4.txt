🧠 From Concept to Code: Building Code Tracker AI in 9 weeks—and the commits keep coming.
#programming

#jetbrains
On August 3rd, I started building an IntelliJ IDEA -JetBrains plugin that could rethink how developers interact with their code. The result? Code Tracker AI—a privacy-first, AI-powered development companion.
🔧 What It Does & More
Local-first code insights from curated analyzers (ESLint, detekt, SQLFluff, etc.)
Optional LLM connectors (Amazon Q, Gemini, Copilot) with schema validation
Smart documentation and semantic search across your dev history
Automatic time tracking and productivity analytics
SOC 2-ready infrastructure for enterprise teams
🧱 How It’s Built
InsightCard schema for unified insight formatting
Collector pipeline with severity/confidence scoring
Kotlin-based mappers and UI integration with ToolWindow
CredentialStore integration for secure API key handling
JSONL CodeBook for audit trails and insight history
🎨 Branding & Vision
I also designed the logo myself—neural-inspired, clean, and focused. You can check it out at codetrackerai.com
🚀 What’s Next
I’m still building. Full launch is planned for late 2025. But I’m sharing this now to invite feedback, collaboration, and early testers.
