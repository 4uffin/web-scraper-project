[1] Algorithm Showdown: Python vs. JavaScript - Group Anagrams
#leetcode
#python
#javascript
#algorithms
I’ve been revisiting data structures and algorithms lately, but I with a twist to my brain this time: I’m tackling each problem in two different languages to see how they compare. 👾
Welcome to the first post in this series, where I solve the same coding problem in both Python and JavaScript - and discuss about what stands out in each.
[LC-49] Group Anagrams
Problem
Given an array of strings, group all anagrams together. Anagrams are words formed by rearranging letters of another word.
Input: ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

🐍 Python Approach
from collections import defaultdict
def group_anagrams(strs):
result = defaultdict(list)
for s in strs:
# Count character frequency
count = [0] * 26
for char in s:
count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
# Use tuple as hash key
key = tuple(count)
result[key].append(s)
return list(result.values())
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Python learnings: 🖊️
defaultdict(list) eliminates key existence checks
tuple(count) is naturally hashable
🟨 JavaScript Approach
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
const result = new Map();
for (let s of strs) {
// Count character frequency
const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
for (let char of s) {
count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
}
// Convert array to string for hashing
const key = count.join(',');
if (!result.has(key)) {
result.set(key, []);
}
result.get(key).push(s);
}
return Array.from(result.values());
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
JavaScript learnings: 🖊️
Manual key existence validation is required
Array needs string conversion for Map keys
📊 Key Takeaways
Python
JavaScript
Hash Key
tuple(count)
count.join(',')
Default Values
defaultdict
Manual checks
Performance: Both are O(n×m) time, O(n×m) space
