Registering a vCluster Kubernetes clusters with Sveltos: A Quick Start Guide
#kubernetes
Modern Kubernetes environments are rarely static. Teams spin up clusters for testing, staging, and production workloads. Sometimes these clusters are physical, sometimes managed by cloud providers, and increasingly, they‚Äôre virtual clusters (vClusters).
If you‚Äôve ever wanted to manage multiple clusters‚Äîincluding vClusters with a consistent approach, Sveltos can help. Sveltos is a powerful open-source project that simplifies cluster lifecycle management, configuration drift detection, and workload deployment across fleets of clusters.
In this post, we‚Äôll walk through how to set up Sveltos, create a vCluster, and register it with Sveltos. By the end, you‚Äôll have a working setup where you can manage a vCluster just like any other cluster in your fleet.
Prerequisites
Install sveltosctl CLI
curl -L https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltosctl/releases/latest/download/sveltosctl-darwin-amd64 -o sveltosctl
chmod +x sveltosctl
sudo mv sveltosctl /usr/local/bin/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This tool will help us generate manifests for cluster registration and interact with Sveltos.
Install Helm (if not already installed)
Follow Helm installation docs.
Step 1: Deploy Sveltos
Install Sveltos in the management cluster:
helm repo update && helm upgrade --install sveltos projectsveltos/projectsveltos --namespace projectsveltos --create-namespace
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Verify deployment:
helm list -n projectsveltos
kubectl get pods -n projectsveltos
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
At this point, Sveltos CRDs and the controller should be active in your cluster.
Step 2: Deploy the Dashboard (Optional)
For visualization and management through UI:
helm install sveltos-dashboard projectsveltos/sveltos-dashboard -n projectsveltos
helm list -n projectsveltos
kubectl port-forward service/dashboard -n projectsveltos 8080:80
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Access the dashboard at: http://localhost:8080/login
Create an admin service account and token:
kubectl create sa platform-admin -n default
kubectl create clusterrolebinding platform-admin-access --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount default:platform-admin
kubectl create token platform-admin -n default --duration=24h
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Use the token to log into the dashboard.
Step 3: Create a vCluster
Create a new virtual cluster:
vcluster create my-vcluster --namespace my-team
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Disconnect once created:
vcluster disconnect
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Register vCluster with Sveltos
Here‚Äôs where the integration happens.
Generate a SveltosCluster manifest for the vCluster:
sveltosctl register cluster
--namespace=monitoring
--cluster=vcluster
--pullmode
--labels=environment=production,tier=backend
> sveltoscluster_registration.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This creates the YAML that describes your vCluster as a managed entity in Sveltos.
Connect to the vCluster:
vcluster connect my-vcluster --namespace my-team
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Apply the registration YAML inside the vCluster:
kubectl apply -f sveltoscluster_registration.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
‚úÖ And that‚Äôs it! üéâ Your vCluster is now registered with Sveltos.
What‚Äôs Next?
With your vCluster registered, you can now:
Apply ClusterProfiles to define policies and workloads.
Use drift detection to ensure your vCluster stays compliant.
Manage add-ons (like monitoring stacks) consistently across environments.
Instead of treating vClusters as temporary or ‚Äúdisposable,‚Äù you‚Äôve elevated them to first-class citizens in your multi-cluster strategy.
