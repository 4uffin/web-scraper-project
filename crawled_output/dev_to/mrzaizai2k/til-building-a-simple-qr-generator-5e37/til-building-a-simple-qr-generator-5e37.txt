TIL: Building a Simple QR Generator
I built a lightweight, open-source tool to create customized QR codes.
No subscriptions, no paywalls ‚Äî just a straightforward QR generator that works right in your browser üöÄ.

üí≠ Why I Built This
Most QR code tools online feel bloated or restrictive:
Many require accounts or subscriptions just to download a QR code.
Some lock basic features like color, logo, or export behind a paywall.
Others are overloaded with ads, making them slow and frustrating.
I just wanted something clean, simple, and free ‚Äî a tool where you can generate and customize QR codes without hassle.
That‚Äôs why I created Simple QR Generator ‚Äî a project that anyone can use instantly in their browser.
‚ú® Features
Generate QR codes from any text or URL.
Customize:
Colors
Shapes
Styles
Add a logo (upload your own or use an image URL).
Adjust:
Size
Margin
Error correction level
Export to PNG or SVG.
Copy QR codes directly to clipboard.
‚ö° How It Works
Enter your text or URL in the input box.
Adjust customization options (color, style, size, error correction).
(Optional) Upload or link a logo to embed inside the QR code.
Click Generate, then either:
Export as PNG or SVG, or
Copy directly to clipboard for quick use.
All of this happens entirely in your browser ‚Äî no server-side processing, no data collection.
üñ•Ô∏è Demo Screenshot
Here‚Äôs a quick look at the tool in action üëá
You can try it live here üëâ Simple QR Generator
üí° Why I Like It
Lightweight: works instantly in any browser.
No limits: all features are free and open-source.
Customizable: from logos to colors, you can make QR codes match your style.
Practical: whether it‚Äôs sharing a link, business info, or Wi-Fi credentials, it just works.
It started as a small side project for myself, but it turned into a neat tool worth sharing.
üîó Reference
All the code is open-source on my GitHub:
