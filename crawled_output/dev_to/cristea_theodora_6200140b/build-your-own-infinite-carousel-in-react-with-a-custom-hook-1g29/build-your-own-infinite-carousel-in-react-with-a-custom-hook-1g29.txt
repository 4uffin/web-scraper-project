Build Your Own Infinite Carousel in React (with a Custom Hook)‚ùó
#react
#javascript
#tutorial
#css
Hey!ü•∞ It‚Äôs been a while since my last post‚Ä¶
No ofcorse, I haven‚Äôt quit web development,üôÉ and nope, I didn‚Äôt go on a long vacation either.üôÉ Quite the opposite - I‚Äôve been coding non-stop, 6 out of 7 days. I‚Äôve been busy with a project that I‚Äôll share with you soon, but today I want to show you something smaller but really useful:
‚û§ How I built a reusable infinite carousel in React, using only a custom hook, a component, and some CSS.
GitHub: Carousel
Demo: Carousel
Why another carousel‚ùì
Carousels are everywhere: online shops, landing pages, portfolios‚Ä¶ and let‚Äôs be honest, many developers reach for a big library when all they need is a simple slider.
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with libraries, but sometimes it‚Äôs good to be curious and understand the logic behind them. Building one yourself gives you full control and help you creating your own mini-library.
What does an infinite carousel mean‚ùì
A classic carousel has a beginning and an end. If you reach the last image and click ‚Äúnext,‚Äù it either stops or jumps back abruptly. An infinite carousel creates the illusion that the list never ends.
How‚ùì
Clone a few slides and add them to the beginning and end.
When you move too far left or right, instantly reposition the list without the user noticing. This trick gives the user the feeling they can scroll endlessly.
Sounds a bit confusing‚ùìDon‚Äôt worry, keep reading and it will all make sense.ü•∞
Project structure:
I split the logic into two parts:
‚Ä¢ InfiniteCarousel component ‚û§
handles the UI (images, titles, navigation buttons).
‚Ä¢ useCarousel hook ‚û§
handles the logic (clones, index, transitions, auto-slide, resize).
This makes the carousel reusable: you can drop the hook into any React project and use it with any type of content.
The useCarousel hook
The hook accepts a few configuration options:
useCarousel({
visibleSlides: 4,
// how many slides are visible at once
gap: 32,
// spacing between them
autoSlideInterval: 3000,
// autoplay interval in ms
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What it does under the hood‚ùì
‚Ä¢ Index tracking: ‚û§
keeps track of the current position with a ref.
‚Ä¢ Transitions ‚û§
moves the carousel with translateX.
‚Ä¢ Invisible reset ‚û§
when you go past the edges, it disables transition, instantly repositions, then continues normally.
‚Ä¢ Auto-slide ‚û§ moves slides automatically, pauses on hover.
‚Ä¢ Resize handler ‚û§ recalculates slide widths when the window size changes.
The InfiniteCarousel component
The UI is quite straightforward:
‚Ä¢ ul for the list of slides,
‚Ä¢ li for each image,
‚Ä¢ two buttons for manual navigation.
Responsive design
With some media queries, the carousel adapts to different screen sizes:
‚Ä¢ On mobile ‚Üí 1‚Äì2 slides visible,
‚Ä¢ On tablet ‚Üí 3 slides,
‚Ä¢ On desktop ‚Üí 4 slides.
@media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
.li-right-tea {
width: calc(50% - 32px / 2);
}
}
@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
.li-right-tea {
width: calc(33.33% - 64px / 3);
}
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
.li-right-tea {
width: calc(25% - 96px / 4);
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Visual scheme of the logic
Let‚Äôs say we have 8 original slides: A B C D E F G H We want 4 visible at once ‚û§
that means we clone 4 at the beginning and 4 at the end.
Key positions:
‚Ä¢ Start (index = 4) ‚û§ aligned on the first real slide (A)
Visible: [ A | B | C | D ]
‚Ä¢ Going right (next):
You reach index 11 (H).
Next click ‚û§ index 12 (A clone).
‚û§ On transitionend, it instantly resets back to index 4 (A real).
‚Ä¢ Going left (prev):
You reach index 3 (H clone).
‚û§ On transitionend, it instantly resets back to index 11 (H real).
The user never sees the*jump* The illusion of infinity is preserved.
Final functionality
‚Ä¢ Manual navigation with buttons,
‚Ä¢ Auto-slide with customizable interval,
‚Ä¢ Pause on hover,
‚Ä¢ Invisible reset for infinite effect,
‚Ä¢ Responsive (media queries + resize recalculation),
‚Ä¢ Reusable (hook works with any type of content, not just images).
Conclusion‚ù§Ô∏è
Now you have a fully working infinite carousel in React, built from scratch, with no external libraries, and with full control over the behavior.ü•∞Of course, it can be enhanced with indicators (dots) for progress, animations, and other functionalities! I think building your own mini-libraries in React is worth it. You not only learn how things work under the hood, but you also get the freedom to extend and customize them however you like.
I hope this post helps you!ü•∞ For me, rewriting it was a great way to solidify my understanding. Let me know in the comments if you have questions or if this was useful for you.
Happy coding!

This is such a well-explained tutorial! The way you handled transitions and the invisible reset for the infinite effect is super clever. I also appreciate how you made the carousel responsive with media queries and resize handling it‚Äôs a detail that‚Äôs often overlooked.
Quick question: how would you approach adding indicators (like dots) for progress? Would you integrate it into the hook or keep it as a separate component? Curious to hear your take!

I‚Äôm glad you like the functionality,ü§óand I hope you understood the logic behind the carousel, it‚Äôs quite simple.
I tried hard to explain it in a way that would make sense both for beginners and for more advanced users.
When working with React, it‚Äôs recommended not to make components too long and to try separating them into smaller components for better site functionality, for reusability, clarity, and maintainability. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre adding the progress indicators functionality! üôÉI didn‚Äôt split everything into too many components or hooks so it would be easier to read, but of course, they can be separated!
I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs helpful to you, happy coding!ü§ó

You're welcome!ü§ó I didn‚Äôt split the hook into smaller parts myself, but if you‚Äôd like to shorten it, you could simplify it into two hooks.
As for performance‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs not the perfect carousel, but for me it‚Äôs not about perfection, it‚Äôs about the learning process... I might create another one in the future or make improvements to this one to share here on DEV.üòä
So, The first hook could handle navigation + index management - taking care of the index, the showNext and showPrev functions, and the resets when you reach the end of the original slides.
The second hook could handle autoSlide (interval + pause on hover) - managing only the interval and the pause/resume on hover logic.
Splitting the logic into two hooks would mainly help with clarity, reusability, and maintainability. Hope this helps! Happy coding!ü§ó
