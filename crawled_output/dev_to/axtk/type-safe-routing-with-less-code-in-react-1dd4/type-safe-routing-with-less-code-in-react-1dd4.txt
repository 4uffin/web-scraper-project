Type-safe routing with less code in React
#react
#webdev
#typescript
#javascript
In a recent post, I had a code example showcasing a concise way to do routing in React. One of its features is a ternary routing function withRoute(routePattern, x, y) acting similarly to the ternary conditional operator matchesRoutePattern ? x : y which works equally with components and prop values:
<nav className={withRoute('/', 'full', 'compact')}>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
{withRoute('/', <Intro/>)}
{withRoute(/^\/sections\/(?<id>\d+)\/?$/, ({params}) => (
<Section id={params.id}/>
))}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
In this code, the params type has a generic shape of Record<string, string | undefined> of an object containing string portions of a string URL. It's sufficient in many cases, but sometimes we might wish for preciser typing. For example, in the code above, params.id matches the pattern of \d+, so it could be an actual number rather than a string.
The discussed approach to routing, in fact, allows for gradual adoption of stricter route typing by incrementally defining URL schemas scaling up from a single component to the entire app.
Let's define a URL schema for our code example to make sure that params.id is typed as a number, and the root URL doesn't accept any params at all:
import {A, useRoute} from '@t8/react-router';
import {createURLSchema} from 'url-shape';
import {z} from 'zod';
const {url} = createURLSchema({
'/': null, // goes without parameters
'/sections/:id': {
// path placeholders
params: z.object({
id: z.coerce.number(),
}),
// similarly, a `query` schema can be added to a route,
// if necessary
},
});
let App = () => {
let {withRoute} = useRoute();
// `withRoute(routePattern, x, y)` acts similarly to
// `matchesRoutePattern ? x : y`
return (
<>
<nav className={withRoute(url('/'), 'full', 'compact')}>
<A href={url('/')}>
Intro
</A>{' '}
<A href={url('/sections/:id', {params: {id: 1}})}>
Section 1
</A>
</nav>
{withRoute(url('/'), <Intro/>)}
{withRoute(url('/sections/:id'), ({params}) => (
<Section id={params.id}/>
))}
</>
);
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Note that the shapes of the components and the routing function withRoute() remain the same. All what's changed inside the component is that the string and RegExp URL patterns were replaced with the typed URL builder url(). It's using these typed route patterns that makes params.id to be now resolved as a number, and that the route shapes comply with the zod-powered URL schema. (Hover over params and id in the sandbox example to see these types for yourself.)
Although not a requirement, we might want to cover the entire app with type-safe routes. Once we've done that, we might want to disallow plain string and RegExp URLs and URL patterns created outside the URL builder (the url() function) altogether to enforce type-safe routing further on. This can be done by overriding the router's type config in our app's code:
declare module '@t8/react-router' {
interface Config {
strict: true;
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
But this is completely optional. Regardless of this setting, a URL schema doesn't have to be defined in a single place, there can be multiple partial URL schemas representing certain portions of the app. This incremental approach to type-safe routing, from a partial URL schema to strict application-wide type safety, makes it easier to adopt and maintain, without impairing the conciseness of the routing code.
This is essentially all what's required to set up type-safe routes with this pretty minimalist approach to routing. See also the package overview for more details on its other aspects.

Love how this keeps routing clean without the usual boilerplate! Using Zod for type-safe params is slick.
