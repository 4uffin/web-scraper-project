Introduction to TrueReviewer: A Product Review Package for Laravel ðŸš€
#laravel
#vue
#opensource
#webdev
If youâ€™ve ever built a Laravel app with reviews, you already know the pain:
Setting up models, migrations, and relationships
Designing star ratings and UI widgets that donâ€™t look out of place
Preventing spam or fake reviews
Ending up with a basic system that feels incomplete
Iâ€™ve been there and thatâ€™s why I built TrueReviewer.
Why Another Review System? ðŸ¤”
When I launched my earlier package Commenter, I noticed something missing in the Laravel ecosystem:
ðŸ‘‰ A ready-to-use, flexible, and modern review system that integrates with any Laravel app.
So I spent months designing and building TrueReviewer with one goal:
Make reviews simple, beautiful, and trustworthy.
Key Features : âœ¨
API Agnostic ðŸ”Œ
Works with both traditional Laravel apps and API-driven SPAs.
Front-end is decoupled, with Vue components compiled to JS.
Pre-Built Components ðŸŽ¨
Comes with five beautiful Vue components that are:
Accessible
User-friendly
Modular (use them independently)
Performance + Customization âš¡
Lightweight, fast, and fully customizable to match your projectâ€™s style.
AI-Powered Extras ðŸ¤–
Sentiment detection â†’ automatically detects positive/negative tone.
Integrity checks â†’ catch spam or low-quality reviews.
This goes beyond just stars and text. It helps you build trust.
Why Sponsorware? ðŸ’¡
Laravel developers love open-source (me too!).
But building TrueReviewer took significant time and resources.
So instead of going fully free, Iâ€™m releasing it as sponsorware:
Support the project with a sponsorship
Get full access to the package
Help me keep improving it
Itâ€™s my way of making it sustainable while still giving back to the community.
Learn More ðŸ”—
ðŸ‘‰ TrueReviewer Website
If youâ€™re building:
ðŸ›’ An e-commerce site
ðŸ“¦ A SaaS product
ðŸ‘¥ A community platform
â€¦then reviews matter. And TrueReviewer saves you months of development with a polished, plug-and-play solution.
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™d love to hear from you:
What challenges have you faced building review systems in Laravel?
