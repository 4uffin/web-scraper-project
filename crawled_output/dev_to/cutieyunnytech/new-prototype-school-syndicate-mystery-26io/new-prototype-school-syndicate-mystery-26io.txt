üéÆ New Prototype: School Syndicate Mystery

üöÄ My First Serious-Game Prototype
This is my very first step into the serious-game world‚Äîwhere play meets learning.
I built a browser-based mystery called School Syndicate to explore:
‚Ä¢ üïµÔ∏è Investigation & deduction ‚Äì players track a fictional ‚Äústudy enhancer‚Äù craze.
‚Ä¢ üëë Cycle of power ‚Äì accuse the mastermind, then choose: take the crown or break the chain.
‚Ä¢ üè∞ Positive choice ‚Äì reject power to earn a Badge of Integrity and design prevention programs.
Everything is pure HTML/CSS/JS‚Äîno libraries, no backend.
It‚Äôs short, narrative-driven, and completely fictional (no real drug names or instructions).
This is my first experiment in serious games, blending storytelling and social themes.
Feedback from educators, game devs, or anyone curious is super welcome!
Inspiration & Credits
‚ÄúThe seed for this project came from bits and pieces‚Äîan Instagram reel about teen crime dramas, a few movies I‚Äôve watched, and random chats with friends.
I reshaped those fragments into something new: a fictional school mystery that avoids real names, real drugs, or anything instructional.‚Äù
