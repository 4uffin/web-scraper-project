Build Laravel AI Features in Minutes: A Guide to the Gemini Package
#laravel
#gemini
#ai
#api
Tired of reading docs and just want to see the code? Let's dive straight into how you can use the hosseinhezami/laravel-gemini package to add powerful AI features to your Laravel application. The API is clean, fluent, and incredibly powerful.
Installation & Setup
First, get the package.
composer require hosseinhezami/laravel-gemini
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Publish the config file and set your API key.
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=gemini-config
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
# .env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Code Examples: See It in Action
1. Basic Text Generation & Chat
The TextBuilder makes generating text or creating a chat interface simple.
use HosseinHezami\LaravelGemini\Facades\Gemini;
// Simple prompt
$response = Gemini::text()
->prompt('Write a tagline for a developer blog.')
->generate();
echo $response->content();
// Chat with history
$history = [
['role' => 'user', 'parts' => [['text' => 'Hello!']]],
['role' => 'model', 'parts' => [['text' => 'Hi there! How can I help?']]]
];
$response = Gemini::text()
->prompt('What’s the weather like?')
->history($history)
->temperature(0.7)
->generate();
echo $response->content();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Structured Data Extraction
Need consistent JSON output from a messy prompt? Use structuredSchema.
$response = Gemini::text()
->structuredSchema([
'type' => 'object',
'properties' => [
'sentiment' => [
'type' => 'string',
'enum' => ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral']
],
'confidence' => ['type' => 'number'],
'key_points' => {
'type' => 'array',
'items' => {'type' => 'string'}
}
],
'required' => ['sentiment']
])
->prompt('The product is amazing but the delivery was late. I love the features though.')
->generate();
$analysis = json_decode($response->content());
// $analysis->sentiment, $analysis->key_points, etc.
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Image Generation
Generate images from a text description.
$response = Gemini::image()
->prompt('A minimalist logo for a tech startup called "Nexus", using blue and green')
->generate();
// Save the generated image directly
$response->save(storage_path('app/logo.png'));
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Document Understanding
Upload a file (PDF, DOC, image) and ask questions about it.
// First, upload the file to Gemini's servers
$fileUri = Gemini::files()->upload('document', $pathToInvoicePdf);
// Then, use it in a prompt
$response = Gemini::text()
->upload('document', $pathToInvoicePdf) // or use the $fileUri
->prompt('What is the total amount due on this invoice?')
->generate();
echo $response->content();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Text-to-Speech (Audio)
Generate spoken audio from text.
$response = Gemini::audio()
->prompt('Welcome to our application. We are thrilled to have you on board.')
->voiceName('Kore') // Check docs for available voices
->generate();
// The package smartly handles the binary response,
// allowing you to save it directly.
$response->save(public_path('audio/welcome.mp3'));
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
6. Real-Time Streaming
Crucial for building chat interfaces that feel fast and responsive.
// In your controller (e.g., app/Http/Controllers/ChatController.php)
public function stream(Request $request)
{
return response()->stream(function () use ($request) {
Gemini::text()
->model('gemini-2.5-flash-lite') // Use a fast model for streaming
->prompt($request->query('message'))
->stream(function ($chunk) {
$text = $chunk['text'] ?? '';
if (connection_aborted()) return;
echo "data: " . json_encode(['text' => $text]) . "\n\n";
ob_flush();
flush();
});
}, 200, [
'Content-Type' => 'text/event-stream',
'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache',
'Connection' => 'keep-alive',
'X-Accel-Buffering' => 'no',
]);
}
