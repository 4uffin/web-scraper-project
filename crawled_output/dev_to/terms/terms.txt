12. Fees, Payment, Renewal
Fees for Paid Services.Fees for Paid Services. Some of our Services may be offered for a fee (collectively, “Paid Services”). This section applies to any purchases of Paid Services.
By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be different kinds of fees, for instance some that are one-time, recurring, and/or based on an advertising campaign budget that you set.
For recurring fees
(AKA Subscriptions), your subscription begins on your purchase date, and we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting plusplus@dev.to.
Payment.You must provide accurate and up-to-date payment information. By providing your payment information, you authorize us to store it until you request deletion. If your payment fails, we suspect fraud, or Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you. You authorize us to charge any updated payment information provided by your bank or payment service provider (e.g., new expiration date) or other payment methods provided if we can’t charge your primary payment method.
Automatic Renewal. By enrolling in a subscription, you authorize us to automatically charge the then-applicable fees for each subsequent subscription period until the subscription is canceled. If you received a discount, used a coupon code, or subscribed during a free trial or promotion, your subscription will automatically renew for the full price of the subscription at the end of the discount period. This means that unless you cancel a subscription, it’ll automatically renew and we’ll charge your payment method(s). The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
You can view your renewal date(s), cancel, or manage subscriptions by contacting plusplus@dev.to.
Fees and Changes. We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This means that we may change our fees going forward or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.
Refunds.There are no refunds and all payments are final.

If you cancel this contract, we will reimburse you all payments we have received from you, without undue delay and no later than within fourteen days from the day on which we received the notification of your cancellation of this contract. For this repayment, we will use the same means of payment that you used for the original transaction, unless expressly agreed otherwise with you; you will not be charged for this repayment.
