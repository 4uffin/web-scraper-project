NeedU — Silent SOS for Kiro Hackathon
Hold. Record. Share. A fast, privacy‑minded silent SOS for forced abductions and violent situations. Built with Flutter + Firebase.
NeedU is a lightweight silent SOS app: press-and-hold the SOS button for 3 seconds to silently start a 30s background audio recordingplus share your live location with up to three emergency contacts. Built to work when you can't speak or move the phone.
What I built
Hold-to-trigger SOS with animated countdown and particles.
Haptic + snackbar confirmation on trigger.
Background audio recording (iOS & Android considerations) — recording is broken into safe 5s chunks and uploaded immediately to Firebase Storage.
Phone OTP onboarding and robust authentication (Email/Password, Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In). Phone verification is required on sign-up so SOS alerts reach real phone numbers.
Uses a design system: AppColors, AppTypography, AppTheme, and SizeConfig for consistent styling.
Local persistence of user object in SharedPreferences and Firestore users/{uid} collection for cloud storage.
The exact prompt / code snippets (kept unchanged)
I asked an assistant to scaffold two files and to follow strict design constraints. The prompt (verbatim):
{% embed I need you to generate 2 files for my Flutter project:
1. `sos_page.dart`
2. `audio_services.dart`
Follow these rules strictly:
- Use my existing **design system** (`AppColors`, `AppTypography`, `AppTheme`, and `SizeConfig`) for colors, text, paddings, spacings, and icons.
- Do not add extra UI styles outside of these specs. Always refer to `SizeConfig` for dimensions and spacing.
- `sos_page.dart` should:
- Have an SOS button with the following flow:
- User holds for 3 seconds → show animated countdown circle + particles.
- After 3s → trigger SOS with haptic feedback + snackbar.
- Start audio recording via `AudioServices`.
- Record for 30s in safe 5s chunks, each uploaded to Firebase Storage.
- Show snackbars for: service triggered, recording started, recording uploaded successfully, or failure.
- Button must disable while processing (to prevent multiple triggers).
- UI:
- Center SOS button with shield icon + "SOS" text.
- Background glow + particles (spread out 100–200px radius, animated).
- Countdown number shown in the button during hold (before trigger).
- Above button: Title (`Stay Safe`) and subtitle (`Hold 3 secs to trigger alert!`) using `AppTypography` and `AppColors`.
- Below button: show emergency contacts card (`EmergencyContacts()` if logged in, else `guestEcCard(context)`).
- Use `SizeConfig` for all heights, paddings, and text sizes.
- `audio_services.dart` should:
- Provide an `AudioServices` singleton class for:
- Starting and stopping recordings.
- Recording in safe chunks (5s each for total 30s).
- Uploading to Firebase Storage under `sos_recordings/{uid}/Triggered_on_{date}/filename.m4a`.
- Returning a list of URLs after uploads.
- Playing last recorded file.
- Handle microphone permission requests.
- Support background recording on iOS with `_configureAudioSession`.
- Use `recordInSafeChunks` for the SOSPage.
- Constraints:
- No unused states/variables in UI (recording handled in service).
- Use `Utilis.showSnackBar` for user messages.
- Use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for colors, combined with AppColors where needed.
- File structure: keep each file self-contained and import only required dependencies.

(yeah i polished my prompt with GPT🥲)

Project goal (verbatim)
Project goal
------------
Make/update the app authentication flow so that:
- First-time sign-up collects **name + phone** (profile & emergencyContacts may be null).
- Phone number is verified by **Firebase Phone OTP**.
- After successful verification, create a Firestore `users` document and **return** the map:
{
'uid': uid,
'name': name,
'profilePhotoUrl': profilePhotoUrl,
'emergencyContacts': emergencyContacts.value,
'phoneNumber': phoneNumber,
'createdAt': createdAt,
}
(If profilePhotoUrl or emergencyContacts are not provided, store `null` or empty array).
- On successful sign-up **save user locally** (persist the same map) and set the in-app global/current user.
- On sign-in (email/password or phone OTP) also save user locally.
- Use `go_router` for navigation states (signIn, signUp, accountSetup, sosPage) and update routes accordingly.
- Follow existing UI/design tokens and `SizeConfig` sizing everywhere.
Files to generate/modify
------------------------
1. `lib/features/auth/firebase_auth_services.dart` (or update existing)
- Implements phone OTP flow using `FirebaseAuth.verifyPhoneNumber` + `PhoneAuthProvider.credential`.
- Exposes:
- `Future<void> requestPhoneOtp({required String phone, required Function(String verificationId) onCodeSent, required Function(String error) onError})`
- `Future<Map<String, dynamic>?> verifyPhoneOtpAndSignUp({ required String verificationId, required String smsCode, required String name, String? profilePhotoUrl, List<Map<String,String>>? emergencyContacts })`
- This function must:
1. Verify OTP and sign in the phone user (or link with existing account if necessary).
2. If this is first-time sign up (no existing user doc in Firestore), write a `users/{uid}` doc with fields:
- `uid`, `name`, `profilePhotoUrl` (nullable), `emergencyContacts` (nullable/array), `phoneNumber`, `createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`
3. Read back the created/updated user doc and **return the exact map**:
{
'uid': uid,
'name': name,
'profilePhotoUrl': profilePhotoUrl,
'emergencyContacts': emergencyContacts.value,
'phoneNumber': phoneNumber,
'createdAt': createdAt,
}
(Use `Timestamp` to store createdAt in Firestore, and return that field raw or converted to ISO string — prefer returning the server timestamp value).
4. If user already exists, return the existing user map.
5. Throw/return null on failure — but ensure UI receives clear error strings for snackbars.
- `Future<Map<String,dynamic>?> signInWithPhoneOtp({required String verificationId, required String smsCode})` — for signing existing accounts.
- `Future<void> signOut()` handling cleanup, and clearing local stored user.
2. `lib/features/auth/auth_services.dart` (UI glue)
- Update/replace the current AuthScreen, SignUp and Phone OTP widgets with a clear flow:
- **SignUp**: collects `name` and `phoneNumber` (use `IntlPhoneField`), validate them, then call `requestPhoneOtp`.
- On `codeSent`, navigate to an OTP screen (use `go_router` navigation: e.g., `context.go('/auth/verifyOtp', extra: { 'verificationId': vid, 'name': name, 'phone': phone })`).
- **OTP Screen**: input field for code; on submit call `verifyPhoneOtpAndSignUp(verificationId, code, name, ...)`.
- After successful return map from `verifyPhoneOtpAndSignUp`, save map locally and set global `currentUser` (persist to SharedPreferences as JSON string under key `currentUser`), then navigate to `/accountSetup` (or `/sosPage` if accountSetup not required).
- **SignIn**: support both email/password and phone-sign-in (OTP). After successful sign-in, fetch Firestore user doc, persist locally and set global `currentUser`.
3. Local storage
- Use `shared_preferences` package to store `currentUser` JSON string.
- Implement helper `LocalUserStore.saveUser(Map user)` and `LocalUserStore.getUser()` to read on app start and set `currentUser` global variable if present.
4. Firestore structure & queries
- Collection: `users`
- Document ID: use `uid` from `FirebaseAuth.currentUser.uid`.
- Required fields: `uid`, `name`, `profilePhotoUrl` (nullable), `emergencyContacts` (nullable or array), `phoneNumber`, `createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp()`
- When creating user, ensure **phone uniqueness** check before creation (query `users` for `phoneNumber` equals requested phone — if found, treat as existing account and return that user map instead of creating duplicate).
5. go_router state & routes
- Routes (example):
- `/` → landing/login
- `/auth/signUp` → SignUp page
- `/auth/signIn` → SignIn page
- `/auth/verifyOtp` → OTP verification page (expects `verificationId`, `name`, `phone`)
- `/accountSetup` → post sign-up additional setup (optional)
- `/sosPage` → main app page after login
- Ensure navigation passes required args via `extra` and that the OTP page reads them.
6. UI + design constraints
- Use `AppTypography`, `AppColors`, `AppTheme`, and `SizeConfig` for sizes, paddings and fonts.
- Phone & OTP input use `IntlPhoneField` and appropriate input types.
- Use `Utilis.showSnackBar` for success/error messages.
- Keep forms accessible, validate input, show loading indicators (disable buttons) during network ops.
- Keep code modular and single-responsibility: UI in `auth_services.dart`, Firebase functions in `firebase_auth_services.dart`, local store in `local_user_store.dart` (or inside the firebase services if simpler).
7. Implementation notes & platform setup (include as a checklist)
- Add Firebase packages: `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_core`, `shared_preferences`, `intl_phone_field`.
- Android: Ensure `google-services.json` configured, `minSdkVersion` >= required, and `build.gradle` configured for phone auth.
- iOS: enable Push/Phone capabilities if needed, add `GoogleService-Info.plist`.
- Add SHA-1 & SHA-256 to Firebase console for phone auth on Android.
- Secure rules: ensure `users` collection write is only possible for authenticated uid or from server functions.
8. Return contract
- The sign-up function **must return** the exact map:
{
'uid': uid,
'name': name,
'profilePhotoUrl': profilePhotoUrl,
'emergencyContacts': emergencyContacts.value,
'phoneNumber': phoneNumber,
'createdAt': createdAt,
}
- After receiving this map in UI, the UI must save it locally and set `currentUser` global.
9. Edge cases & UX details
- If phone OTP times out or verification fails, show clear error and allow resend.
- If user cancels during OTP, navigate back to signUp page.
- If user profile or emergencyContacts are null, allow proceeding and provide UI to edit later (Account Setup).
- Guest flow: retain `isGuest` behavior, but encourage sign-up.
Deliverable
-----------
- Update/generate the files described (UI + firebase service + local store).
- Keep code clean, commented and aligned with existing project style.
- Return nothing else — just generate the code files and wire routing/state exactly as described.
