How to Build a Full-Featured React Chat App in Minutes (Open-Source Starter)

Building a feature-rich, real-time chat application is a common requirement, but it's rarely a simple task. A "simple" request for chat can quickly spiral into a major engineering project. You need a database for message history, a real-time API with WebSockets for instant delivery, presence logic to see who's online, and a secure authentication layer. This can take weeks, if not months, to build and scale properly.
What if you could skip all of that and get a better result in minutes?
That's why today, we're thrilled to release the Vaultrice Real-Time Chat Starter — a free, open-source boilerplate that lets you deploy a complete, production-ready chat application in minutes.
Show, Don't Tell: See It In Action
Here’s a look at the application you'll have running on your local machine in just a couple of minutes.
What's Inside? A Production-Ready Feature Set
This isn't just a basic messenger. We've packed it with all the features you'd expect from a modern chat experience, all powered by Vaultrice and our @vaultrice/react-components library:
💬 Real-Time Messaging: Instant message delivery and synchronization across all clients.
👥 Live Presence Indicators: See who's online in your room with a live-updating avatar pile. This fosters a sense of community and connection.
✍️ Typing Indicators: Know when others are composing messages, which makes the conversation feel more natural and responsive.
💾 Persistent Message History: Chat history survives page reloads. The starter is configured to store the last 100 messages per room, but this is fully customizable.
🗳️ Interactive Voting: A built-in feedback flow showcases how other real-time components can be integrated into the user journey.
🎨 Responsive Design: The entire application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile.
The "Aha!" Moment: The Code
The true magic is how little code is required to enable this entire experience. The application's core logic is powered by a single component, <ChatRoom />, which handles all the complex real-time functionality for you.
<ChatRoom
id="unique-room-id"
user={currentUser}
title="Your Chat Title"
credentials={vaultriceCredentials}
persistMessages={true}
messageHistoryLimit={100}
/>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How is this Possible Without a Backend?
The starter kit's architecture is simple: the Vite + React frontend communicates directly with the Vaultrice serverless backend. "No backend" means there is no server for you to write, manage, or scale. Vaultrice handles all the complexity of real-time messaging, presence, and data persistence for you.
This allows you to deploy the entire application to any static hosting provider, from modern platforms like Vercel and Netlify to classic hosts like GitHub Pages.
Taking it to Production: Adding User Authentication
While the basic setup is great for quick prototypes, a production application needs to ensure that users are who they say they are. The <ChatRoom /> component makes this easy with the optional auth prop.
The recommended approach is to have your backend generate a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) for your authenticated user. You then pass this token to the component.
// --- On your backend, create an endpoint to generate a token ---
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
const payload = {
sub: currentUser.id, // The user's unique ID
name: currentUser.name,
// ... any other claims you want to verify
};
const identityToken = jwt.sign(payload, YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, { algorithm: 'RS256' });
// --- In your React app, fetch the token and pass it to the component ---
<ChatRoom
id="unique-room-id"
user={currentUser}
title="Your Chat Title"
credentials={vaultriceCredentials} // Now likely using getAccessToken
auth={{ identityToken: identityToken }} // <-- The new auth prop, or: auth={{ getIdentityToken: async () => 'identityToken from backend' }}
persistMessages={true}
messageHistoryLimit={100}
/>

With this single prop, every join and send action from this user is now cryptographically verified by the Vaultrice server, preventing identity spoofing and securing your chat room. To learn more, check out our in-depth Security Guide.
The Power of a Serverless Backend (And Simple Deployment)
How is this possible without a backend? The starter kit's architecture is simple:
Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript
Real-time Backend: Vaultrice provides the entire serverless infrastructure for messaging, presence, and data persistence.
Because there's no server to manage, deployment is incredibly simple and cost-effective. You can deploy this starter kit to any modern static hosting provider, including:
Vercel
Netlify
And any classic static host like GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages
Simply run npm run build and deploy the resulting dist folder.
All For Free, From Start to Finish
We believe powerful tools should be accessible to everyone. That's why this entire solution is free to get started with.
The Vite + React Chat Starter is completely free and open-source under the MIT License. Feel free to clone it, fork it, and use it in your own projects.
Vaultrice has a generous free tier that is more than powerful enough to run this starter kit and many other hobby projects. You can have a real-time application running in production without paying a cent.
Built to Last
We know that choosing a new technology is a big commitment. Vaultrice is a sustainable, bootstrapped business, not a venture-funded experiment. We're profitable thanks to our efficient architecture and our paid plans for professional teams. We're building for the long term, and you can be confident building on top of our platform.
