TypeScript Types Are The Best Kind Of Magic
#typescript
#programming
Sufficiently Advanced Technology
The received wisdom among developers is to avoid magic: magic numbers, magic strings, and framework-flavored "auto-magic".
It's brittle, it's unpredictable, and it's not explicit.
On the other hand, Arthur C. Clarke stated that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
So: Is some bit of magic code a hand grenade with the pin pulled, or are we just not clever enough to get it?
Is there any way to tell the difference?
It Depends
I had a colleague who was tasked with building a Bun-compatible auto-instrumentation framework.
The goal was to create a developer-friendly mechanism to instrument a wide variety of ES2020+ features - method calls, property access, yields from a generator, and so on.
Sadly, it all went a bit sideways.
After two months of work, it leaked memory and had all sorts of finicky edge cases.
By his own admission, he had relied on "too much auto-magic".
So, magic strikes again - but what was the deeper reason the project didn't pan out? I think it boils down to scope.
In this case, the "thing" that the magic was wrangling - its domain, or "scope" - was an entire language.
And ES2020+ is one of the more complicated language specifications out there.
Check out these obscure corners.
For "magic" to work reliably, a restricted domain of operation seems necessary.
A language's type system is usually quite a bit better behaved than the language itself.
That is why, as I dive deeper into TypeScript, I'm warming up to the idea of "type magic".
Quick Case Study
Suppose we have some unmanaged resource that we retrieve by scoped ID:
employee/543293 represents Employee 543293.
department/55 represents Department 55.
building/3 represents Building 3.
Because the resource is ingested into the runtime as some kind of untyped "thing" (bytes, JSON, database record, etc.) we have to parse and then cast with as (if we want to avoid unknown or any).
Writing as Employee, as Department, or as Building - even within dedicated methods like getEmployee - makes my skin crawl a little.
That looks like an opportunity for a late-night miscast with no compile error.
But thankfully it is possible (through the kind of magic that I think Arthur C. Clarke would smile upon) to write the code very cleanly:
const employee : Employee = retrieve(`employee/${key}`);
const department : Department = retrieve(`department/${employee.departmentId}`);
const building : Building = retrieve(`building/${department.buildingId}`);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Notice how that the signature for retrieve is the same for every line, yet we get correctly typed results.
The magic is that the return type of retrieve automatically varies depending on which keyword precedes / in the object identifier : employee, department, or building.
TypeScript is automatically inferring the return type based on the contents of a template literal!!!
Here's the source, followed by an explanation:
type Employee = {
name : string
departmentId : string;
}
type Department = {
id : string
name : string
budget : number
buildingId: string
}
type Building = {
id : string
name : string
}
type KeywordToObjectType = {
employee : Employee,
department : Department,
building : Building
}
// Keyword ::= employee, department, building
type Keyword = keyof KeywordToObjectType;
// Format of the string literal
type ObjectIdentifier = `${Keyword}/${string}`;
// Utility: Extracts the keyword out of the string literal
type ExtractKeyword<T> = T extends `${infer K extends Keyword}/${string}` ?
K :
never;
// Utility: Maps ObjectIdentifier to appropriate type
type TypeForObjectIdentifier<T> = KeywordToObjectType[ExtractKeyword<T>];
// And this is the retrieve function, which handles the cast
export async function retrieve<T extends ObjectIdentifier>(identifier: T) :
Promise<TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>> {
const retrievedValue = {}; // stub -> fetch / parse / etc.
return retrievedValue as TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Generic Types As "Functions On Types"
Note the return type of retrieve: TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>.
It's helpful to think of TypeForObjectIdentifier<T> as a "function on type T", rather than a generic type in the traditional sense.
Therefore the declaration of TypeForObjectIdentifier<T> amounts to a simple "type program" which accepts an object identifier T and returns the appropriate object type. For example, by mapping building/3 to object type Building.
Template Literal Parsing
One of the most powerful features in TypeScript is the ability to perform type inference on template literals - even if some portions of which may have values that are only known at runtime!
In our declaration of ExtractKeyword<T>, we ask TypeScript to match T to the template literal ${infer K extends Keyword}/${string}, otherwise return never (which can trigger a compiler failure).
type ExtractKeyword<T> = T extends `${infer K extends Keyword}/${string}` ?
K :
never;
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
When TypeScript matches building/${department.buildingId} to ${infer K extends Keyword}/${string}, department.buildingId is statically known to be a string.
Likewise, building is bound to K by way of the keyword infer: we can think of K as if it is a named capture group in a regex. Its value is a side effect of matching the object identifier to the template literal type.
Indexed Access Types
In TypeScript's "type language", the syntax Type['property'] produces the type corresponding to the property property on Type.
This is called a indexed access type.
Therefore, KeywordToObjectTypeMap['building'] produces the type Building.
Putting It All Together
type TypeForObjectIdentifier<T> = KeywordToObjectType[ExtractKeyword<T>];
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now it should be clearer how TypeForObjectIdentifier<T> works: Extract the Keyword portion of the string template via ExtractKeyword<T>, and then map it to the object type.
Drawbacks
This trick does not guarantee runtime safety.
If the shape of the retrieved object does not conform to the expected type given its identifier, we're past the limits of what compile-time safety can guarantee.
We can remedy this with some clever use of Zod schemas.
Adding Runtime Validation
First, let's redefine our types as Zod schemas.
import z from "zod"
const Employee = z.object({
id: z.string(),
name: z.string()
});
const Department = z.object({
id : z.string(),
name : z.string(),
budget : z.number(),
buildingId: z.string()
});
const Building = z.object({
id : z.string(),
name : z.string()
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then, we'll define a single source-of-truth const mapping from keyword to Zod schema.
This is more DRY then maintaining both a type mapping and a keyword-to-Zod-schema mapping side by side.
const KeywordToZodSchema = {
employee: Employee,
department: Department,
building: Building
};
type Keyword = keyof typeof KeywordToZodSchema;
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
We still need to the KeywordToObjectType type mapping, but we can recover that programmatically (type-matically?) with a mapped type:
type KeywordToObjectType = {
[key in Keyword]: z.infer<typeof KeywordToZodSchema[key]>
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Finally, we need a function equivalent to ExtractKeyword<T> so that we can pull the correct schema out of KeywordToZodSchema at runtime:
function extractKeyword(identifier: string) : Keyword {
const keyword = identifier.split('/')[0];
if (!(keyword in KeywordToZodSchema)) {
throw new Error("Invalid identifier");
}
return keyword as Keyword;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then it's just a matter of using the extract keyword to index into the schema map and calling Zod's .parse:
export async function retrieve<T extends ObjectIdentifier>(identifier: T) :
Promise<TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>> {
const retrievedValue = {}; // fetch / parse / etc.
const keyword = extractKeyword(identifier);
const parsed = KeywordToZodSchema[keyword].parse(retrievedValue);
return parsed as TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
There's a bit of awkwardness here because we have to narrow parsed from a type union covering all possible object types to the specific type as represented by TypeForObjectIdentifier<T>.
In other words, we've still got an as when theoretically Zod should let us avoid it.
I think it's perfectly fine to stop here. But if we're feeling impractical purists, we can fix it.
Let's kick some "as".

Conclusion
It is possible, helpful, and practical to implement "magic type tricks" for cleaner TypeScript code.
Rather than create trouble, these tricks increase type safety and make for a better developer experience.
