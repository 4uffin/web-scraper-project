Stunning Animated Drawer Navigation in Expo React Native
#reactnative
#typescript
#mobile
#android
ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This
While React Navigationâ€™s standard drawer works, I wanted to create a visually immersive experience where screens dynamically respond to drawer interactions. The goal? An iOS-style navigation with:
Smooth 3D rotations
Scale/perspective animations
Custom profile integration
Seamless gesture control
ðŸ§© Key Tech Stack
expo-router (File-based routing)
react-native-reanimated (Animations)
@react-navigation/drawer (Core navigation)
react-native-gesture-handler (Swipe gestures)
ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Implementatio
1. Core Setup
npx create-expo-app@latest
npx expo install @react-navigation/drawer react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Magic Animation Wrapper (drawer-scene-wrapper.tsx)
This component makes screens dance when the drawer opens:
const DrawerSceneWrapper = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
const progress = useDrawerProgress();
const animatedStyled = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
transform: [
{ scale: interpolate(progress.value, [0, 1], [1, 0.8]) },
{ translateX: interpolate(progress.value, [0, 1], [0, 170]) },
{ rotateY: `${interpolate(progress.value, [0, 1], [0, -25])}deg` }
],
borderRadius: 20
}));
return <Animated.View style={[styles.container, animatedStyled]}>
{children}
</Animated.View>;
};
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
3. Custom Drawer UI (custom-drawer-content.tsx)
Added user profile + logout button:
<SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: "transparent" }}>
{/* Profile Section */}
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.userContainer}>
<Image source={{ uri: "USER_AVATAR_URL" }} style={styles.userImage} />
<View>
<Text style={styles.userName}>Haider Mukhtar</Text>
<Text style={styles.userEmail}>haider@example.com</Text>
</View>
</TouchableOpacity>
{/* Navigation Items */}
<DrawerContentScrollView {...props}>
<DrawerItemList {...props} />
</DrawerContentScrollView>
{/* Logout Button */}
<TouchableOpacity style={styles.logoutButton}>
<Ionicons name="log-out" size={24} color="#FFFFFF" />
<Text style={styles.logoutText}>Logout</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
</SafeAreaView>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Drawer Configuration (_layout.tsx)
Styled the drawer with effects:
<GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
<Drawer
drawerContent={(props) => <CustomDrawerContent {...props} />}
screenOptions={{
headerShown: false,
drawerActiveBackgroundColor: "#33b3a6",
drawerInactiveBackgroundColor: "transparent",
drawerActiveTintColor: "#FFFFFF",
drawerInactiveTintColor: "#FFFFFF",
overlayColor: "transparent",
drawerStyle: {
backgroundColor: "transparent",
width: "60%",
paddingTop: 40,
},
drawerLabelStyle: {
marginLeft: -6,
fontSize: 18,
fontFamily: "PoppinsMedium500",
color: "#FFFFFF",
},
drawerItemStyle: {
marginLeft: -16,
marginRight: 35,
borderTopLeftRadius: 0,
borderBottomLeftRadius: 0,
borderTopRightRadius: 50,
borderBottomRightRadius: 50,
},
sceneStyle: {
backgroundColor: "#26867C",
},
// drawerType: 'front',
}}
>
<Drawer.Screen
name="index"
options={{
title: "Home",
drawerIcon: ({ color }) => <Ionicons name="home" color={color} />
}}
/>
{/* Add other screens here */}
</Drawer>
</GestureHandlerRootView>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
5. Screen Implementation (index.tsx)
Wrapped every screen in DrawerSceneWrapper:
const HomeScreen = () => {
const navigation = useNavigation();
return (
<DrawerSceneWrapper>
<View style={styles.header}>
<TouchableOpacity
onPress={() => navigation.dispatch(DrawerActions.openDrawer())}
>
<Ionicons name="menu" size={28} color="#000" />
</TouchableOpacity>
<Text style={styles.headerTitle}>Home</Text>
</View>
{/* Screen content */}
</DrawerSceneWrapper>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
ðŸ‘€ Demo Time!
Hereâ€™s what it looks like in action:
ðŸŽ¨ Design Highlights
Animated Perspective
3D rotation + scaling synchronized with drawer gestures.
Bubble Menu Items
Rounded active-state highlights with borderTopRightRadius: 50.
ðŸš« Common Pitfalls Solved
Gesture Conflicts: Wrapped root in <GestureHandlerRootView>.
Animation Jank: Used Extrapolation.CLAMP for smooth interpolation.
Safe Areas: Leveraged react-native-safe-area-context for notch support.
TypeScript: Strict typing for drawer props (DrawerContentComponentProps).
ðŸ“± Try It Yourself!

ðŸ’¬ Final Thoughts
This implementation proves that with:
Reanimatedâ€™s interpolation magic âœ¨
Expoâ€™s zero-config tooling ðŸ§°
Strategic styling ðŸŽ¨
â€¦ you can create navigation that delights users while maintaining code simplicity. What would you add to this? Share your ideas below! ðŸ‘‡
