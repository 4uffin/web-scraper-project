Find Any Nike Run Club Guided Run Instantly
Nike‚Äôs Run Club (NRC) app is beloved by runners for its Audio-Guided Runs, where top coaches (and even stars like Eliud Kipchoge) talk you through workouts. These runs cover everything from easy jogs to tough speed sessions. The NRC app now has hundreds of them (306 to be exact), but frustratingly, there‚Äôs no built-in search or filter. Most runners end up endlessly scrolling just to find the one they want.
Here are just a few examples of people complaining (and there are many more):
So I built NRC Run Search to solve exactly this. The site lets you:
Search by keyword: Type any word from a run‚Äôs title or description (e.g. ‚Äútempo‚Äù, ‚ÄúBennet‚Äù, ‚Äúintervals‚Äù) and instantly filter the library.
Because Nike‚Äôs coaches have already prepared amazing guided workouts, we‚Äôre just making them easier to find.
How It Was Built
There were two main problems while building this:
I didn‚Äôt want to manually build the dataset by clicking on each run, copying the info, and cleaning it up.
The share link in the app kept changing every time I clicked it, and it wasn‚Äôt tied to the run‚Äôs actual ID.
Solving Problem 1
I used HTTP Toolkit to set up an HTTP proxy.
This let me route my iPhone traffic through the proxy running on my laptop (same Wi-Fi).
And voil√† ‚Äî all the app‚Äôs requests showed up in the proxy!
From there, I just copied the contents of each request. (Sure, I could‚Äôve scripted it, but honestly, it was only ~12 pages, so this worked fine.)
The dataset now lives in my open-source app here: GitHub link.
Solving Problem 2
Remember the rotating link issue? Turns out NRC uses singular.net to generate deep link URLs ‚Äî probably for shortening + tracking (seems a bit overkill).
The good news: the payload of that call already contained the actual deep link to the app.
Here‚Äôs the code that generates the deep link.
And that‚Äôs it ‚Äî both problems solved, which gave us nrc.tarushnagpal.com.

Great job on building the NRC Run Search tool!
It's a clever solution to a common frustration among runners. Your approach of using HTTP Toolkit to extract the data is both innovative and practical.
I'm curious, did you consider implementing any additional features like filtering by run type (e.g., interval, long run) or duration? Such enhancements could further improve the user experience.
