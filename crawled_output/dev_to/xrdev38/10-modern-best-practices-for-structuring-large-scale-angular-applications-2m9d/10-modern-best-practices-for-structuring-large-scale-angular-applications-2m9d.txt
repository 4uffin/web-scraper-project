10 Modern Best Practices for Structuring Large-Scale Angular Applications
Building large-scale Angular applications is more than just knowing the frameworkâ€”itâ€™s about designing for scalability, maintainability, and collaboration. Poor structure leads to technical debt, slower delivery, and frustrated teams.
Here are 10 modern best practices for structuring Angular apps that stand the test of time.
1. Adopt a Monorepo with Nx
Instead of managing multiple repositories, use a monorepo powered by Nx. It encourages consistent patterns, dependency graph visualization, and advanced tooling like computation caching.
Why?
Consistency across projects
Shared libraries for UI, utilities, and data access
Improved CI/CD performance
npx create-nx-workspace my-org
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
2. Organize with Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Structure code by business domains (users, payments, events) rather than technical layers. Each domain should encapsulate its features, UI, and data access.
Good example:
libs/
users/
feature/
ui/
data-access/
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This keeps business logic close to where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s used.
3. Use Standalone Components & Feature Modules Wisely
Since Angular 14, standalone components reduce boilerplate. For small or isolated features, go standalone. For complex, multi-part domains, combine with feature modules for clarity.
@Component({
standalone: true,
selector: 'app-user-card',
templateUrl: './user-card.html',
imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule],
})
export class UserCard {}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
4. Leverage Angular Signals for State Management
Angular 16+ introduced signals, a powerful reactivity model. For local UI state, prefer signals over external state libraries.
readonly counter = signal(0);
increment() {
this.counter.update(c => c + 1);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
For global state, combine signals with inject() or libraries like @ngrx/signals.
5. Create Clear Library Boundaries
Shared code should live in well-scoped libraries:
ui/ â†’ reusable components
data-access/ â†’ API clients, SDKs
util/ â†’ helpers, pipes, validators
This avoids spaghetti imports and makes dependencies explicit.
6. Implement Feature-Based Routing
Each domain should own its routes. Lazy load features to improve startup performance.
const routes: Routes = [
{
path: 'users',
loadChildren: () => import('@myorg/users/feature').then(m => m.UsersFeatureRoutes),
},
];
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This ensures separation of concerns and faster navigation.
7. Standardize Styling with Design Tokens
Instead of scattering CSS variables or SCSS across components, define design tokens in a central library.
:root {
--color-primary: #1976d2;
--color-accent: #ff4081;
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then consume them across apps for consistent branding.
8. Write Tests Close to the Code
Organize tests next to their implementation (*.spec.ts). Use Jest with Nx for fast unit tests, and Cypress for e2e.
it('should increment counter', () => {
const comp = new CounterComponent();
comp.increment();
expect(comp.counter()).toBe(1);
});
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
9. Document with Storybook
Integrate Storybook for isolated UI development. This helps teams explore components without spinning up the whole app.
npx nx g @nx/angular:storybook-configuration my-ui-lib
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
10. Automate with CI/CD and Code Quality Gates
Scaling teams need guardrails. Use:
Prettier + ESLint for formatting/linting
Husky for Git hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg)
CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) to run tests, linting, and builds
This ensures quality from commit to production.
Conclusion
Large Angular applications thrive when built on strong architectural foundations.
By combining Nx, domain-driven design, signals, and modern tooling, you'll create a structure that scales with both codebase size and team growth.
Ã°Å¸â€˜â€° Start small: refactor one feature using these best practices, then expand across your app.
