Things I Wish I Knew Before Getting Into Tech

Getting into tech is thrilling, but the reality often comes with surprises no one warns you about. I recently had the chance to share my journey, the lessons Iâ€™ve learned, the missteps along the way, and the things I wish I knew earlier. It was an empowering space to connect, reflect, and grow alongside other incredible women in tech
Here are the twelve key insights I shared in my talk.
You Will Fail ... A Lot
The first thing you have to accept in tech is that you will encounter failure. Those red error messages aren't a reflection of your ability; they are a fundamental part of the development process. Learning to see these failures as puzzles to be solved will build your resilience and make you a much stronger problem-solver.
Tech is a Journey of Continuous Learning
The tech landscape is in constant motion. New technologies like AI and prompt engineering emerge, and the tools you use today will continuously evolve. A commitment to lifelong learning isn't just a good idea, it's essential for survival. It can be challenging, but itâ€™s also what keeps this field so exciting.
Not All Solutions Solve a Problem
Itâ€™s incredibly easy to get swept up in the thrill of building something new. But our purpose is to add value, not complexity. I've seen teams pour resources into features no one uses or optimizations that don't matter. Before you build, always ask why. Collaborate closely with your team and focus on the real needs of the user. Just because you can make it, doesnâ€™t mean you should.
Documentation is Your Best Friend
While AI assistants and Stack Overflow have their place, your first stop for answers should always be the official documentation. Itâ€™s written by the people who built the tool, it's always the most up-to-date, and it covers crucial edge cases you won't find anywhere else. Make it a habit, not an afterthought.
You Donâ€™t Need to Know Everything
No one has all the answers, not even senior engineers, who, I promise you, do research like googling things every single day. Whatâ€™s more important than knowing everything is having a growth mindset. Cultivate your curiosity, become resourceful in finding answers, and stay consistent in your efforts to learn and improve.
Your Career Path Wont Be a Straight Line
Itâ€™s okay if your path doesnâ€™t follow the traditional roadmap. It's common to start in one specialty and discover a passion for another. We see developers become Solutions Architects, QA Engineers move into DevOps, and Data Analysts transition into AI. Embrace the journey, it can take you to exciting and unexpected places.
Please, Let's Stop Over-engineering
Engineering should solve real problems, not imaginary future ones. Don't build a system for 10 million users when you only have 10. Avoid adding unnecessary complexity in the name of future-proofing. Solve the problem at hand with the simplest, most effective solution.
Make it work. Make it right. Then make it fast. - Kent Beck
You Are Your Own Biggest Advocate
No one can tell your story better than you. Make your work visible. Do not assume your hard work will speak for itself. You must be proactive in communicating your accomplishments and advocating for your career growth. Schedule regular check-ins with your manager to get feedback and meticulously track your achievements. I highly recommend keeping a brag document, a concept I learned from Julia Evans, to record your successes. It's an invaluable tool for performance reviews and promotion discussions.

Company Culture Truly Matters
The environment you work in has a direct impact on your mental health, career growth, and job satisfaction. A negative culture where blame is common and people fear asking questions will lead to burnout and stifle your potential. When you're interviewing, always ask about the culture. Ask how the team handles failure, how junior developers are supported, and what growth looks like there.
Work-Life Balance Isn't a Luxury, It's a Necessity
Hustle culture is a recipe for burnout. To build a sustainable and joyful career, you must set clear boundaries. This means defining your work hours, actually using your vacation days, and scheduling time for your life outside of tech. My most practical tip? Keep work email and Slack off your personal phone.
Be Intentional About Your Career Progression
Take active ownership of your career path. Think about what your next role is and what you need to do to get there. Work with your manager to create a timeline and identify the small, focused steps to achieve your goals. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. Find mentors who can offer guidance along the way.
Coding is Only Part of the Job
Writing code is a core skill, but it's far from the only one. To truly excel, you must also master:
Problem-solving: Understanding the business logic and user needs behind the code.
Communication: Clearly explaining complex ideas to both technical and non-technical colleagues.
Collaboration: Working effectively with designers, QA engineers, and product managers.
Reading and Maintaining Code: Understanding and improving upon the work of others is just as vital as writing your own
