Custom OpenTelemetry Collectors: Build, Run, and Manage at Scale

I tried thinking back to when the last time I read an actual tutorial that did not include a bunch of em (—) dashes, semicolons, normal dashes, and an unnervingly large quantity of the phrases like “XYZ-thing Alert 🚨” and “Exciting News!”.
Well, hold on to your suspenders folks, here we go again. Part 2 is up and it’s a controversial one. 👇
Have you tried building your own, custom, OpenTelemetry Collector distribution? Did you like it? 😂
I bet you’re NOT smiling. Let alone laughing out loud at that statement like I am right now! I tried, and boy did I have a hard time.
I do have a nice solution to the current norm of building custom OpenTelemetry Collectors, if you have the patience to stick around and read for the next 4 minutes. I’ll do my best to be respectful of your time and cut it down to the bare bones you need to be successful yourself. 🤝
As a normal human I find this hard…
There are a few missing steps in the existing resources and docs around using the OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (OCB). I felt like stumbling through a dark forest and barely making it out the other side. The OCB is an amazing tool for Go developers. That’s the kicker though. A lot of us are not seasoned engineers, let alone experienced Go developers.
That’s why I wanted to write this tutorial. I’ll show you a hands-on guide with the open-source OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder (ODB) from Bindplane. You’ll learn how to build a custom, OpAMP-enabled collector using a manifest.yaml file and GitHub Actions.
Building custom OpenTelemetry collectors is a real need
Custom OpenTelemetry Collectors are no longer a niche thing. As more devs run collectors in intricate Kubernetes environments, or in containers in general, even in the edge, trimming down the binary is becoming standard practice.
Why build a custom collector?
The upstream OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib ships with a lot of components. That’s great for getting started, but in production you don’t need all of them. Simply put, more components equals bigger binaries and more attack surface.
A custom built collector solves that. You define exactly what is needed:
Only receivers, processors, exporters, and extensions you use
Minimal footprint
No unnecessary dependencies
The OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder (ODB)
ODB is Bindplane’s open-source builder for creating custom collectors.
You feed it a manifest.yaml and it gives you binaries and packages for every platform you need.
What you get:
Multi-platform builds: Linux, Windows, macOS, AMD64, ARM64
Multiple formats: .tar.gz, .zip, .deb, .rpm
No Go coding, no manual dependency resolution
OpAMP support (Bindplane-compatible out-of-the-box)
Step 1 — Create a GitHub repo
Start by creating a blank GitHub repo to store the manifest.yaml and run GitHub Action Workflows.
Next, create a new repo in your local env.
echo "# otel-distro-builder-github-action" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME>/otel-distro-builder-github-action.git
git push -u origin main
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The repo is now ready to add a manifest.yaml.
Step 2 — Write a manifest.yaml
The manifest.yaml is where you define what goes in your collector.
Here’s a suggested example that I’ve vetted with my colleagues at Bindplane that contribute to the OpenTelemetry project. It’s minimal, but still includes quality-of-life modules like OpAMP support and common processors.

💡 The opampextension is the key — it’s what lets Bindplane discover and manage your collector.
Step 3 — Automate the build with GitHub Actions
Use the **OpenTelemetry Distribution Builder GitHub Action** to do the heavy lifting.
Here’s a .github/workflows/multi.yaml you can drop in:
name: Matrixed OpenTelemetry Distribution Build

push:
tags:
- "v*" # Runs when a version tag is pushed (e.g., v1.0.0)
workflow_dispatch: # Enables manual triggering from the GitHub UI

Every new version release will:
Build your custom collector for all platforms
Package it into .tar.gz, .zip, .deb, and .rpm
Store them as GitHub Actions artifacts
You should have two files created and ready to add to Git.
git status
[Output]
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
Untracked files:
(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
.github/
manifest.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Commit these changes and push them to your repo.
git add .github manifest.yaml
git commit -m "add a manifest and workflow"
git push origin main
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Create a new release. Make sure to use the same release tag as you specified in your manifest.yaml. In the sample manifest.yaml above I used v0.0.1 which means I need to set the same tag in the release.
Once the release is created, you’ll see it’s initially empty.
Opening the Actions will show the build running.
Give it about 5 minutes to complete. Go get a coffee. ☕
Once the builds are done, you’ll see artifacts saved and added to the release.
Step 4 — Download and run your collector
Let me show you how to run your custom collector in a Linux VM. Grab an artifact from the Release and extract it.
wget https://github.com/adnanrahic/otel-distro-builder-github-action/releases/download/v0.0.1/my-custom-opentelemetry-distro_otelcol_v0.0.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf my-custom-opentelemetry-distro_otelcol_v0.0.1_linux_amd64.tar.gz
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You’ll also get a skeleton collector_config.yaml for the custom collector bundled in the tar as well.
ls -l
[Condensed Output]
-rw-r--r-- collector_config.yaml
-rwxr-xr-x my-custom-opentelemetry-distro

Let’s edit it slightly, and also add Bindplane’s OpAMP configuration by following this guide. Paste this into the config file.
# To limit exposure to denial of service attacks, change the host in endpoints below from 0.0.0.0 to a specific network interface.

**Note:* If you’re on the Growth or Enterprise plans of Bindplane, and want to connect the collector Bindplane, use the secret key after the -s and the labels after the -k. The collector will work as expected with or without connecting to Bindplane. But, you will not get the management capabilities and benefits of OpAMP.*
Now, go ahead and run the collector binary.
./my-custom-opentelemetry-distro --config collector_config.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You’ll see logs like this show as the terminal output confirming the telemetrygeneratorreceiver is creating some dummy logs to validate your config is working.

Within seconds, your custom collector will appear in Bindplane’s Agents list.
You can open the collector config as well.
Bindplane is picking up the collector metadata and the config you added as well. The OpAMP Extension currently doesn't support remote configuration, which means you cannot modify the Collector configuration through the Bindplane UI. You can still view the current Collector configuration as YAML on the Collector page, but the "Choose Another Configuration" button will not be available.
Let me walk you through adding your custom collector to Bindplane and enabling remote configurations.
Step 5 — Remotely manage your custom collector with OpAMP
You can enable remote collector management by adding your custom collector as an Agent Type in Bindplane as outlined in this docs guide. Let me walk you through it step-by-step. 🚶‍♀️
1. Install the Bindplane CLI
The Bindplane CLI lets you manage Bindplane resources including Agent Types. Follow the OS-specific installation steps here.
2. Create an API Key & set a default profile
Create an API Key to access resources in Bindplane with the CLI. Follow the steps here.
3. Create an Agent Type in Bindplane
In Bindplane, an Agent Type represents an OpenTelemetry Collector Distribution. For example, the BDOT v1 and v2 collectors are both Agent Types.
apiVersion: bindplane.observiq.com/v1
kind: AgentType
metadata:
name: my-custom-opentelemetry-distro
displayName: My Custom OpenTelemetry Distro
description: My custom OpenTelemetry collector distro.

This is where you need to be careful. The repositoryLink needs to match the link of the repo where you ran the GitHub action. In my example it was:
https://github.com/adnanrahic/otel-distro-builder-github-action
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The metadata.name value also needs to match the value of dist.name in your manifest.yaml.
Apply the custom Agent Type.
bindplane apply -f /path/to/agent/type/file.yaml
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Finally, sync the Agent Type to load it into Bindplane.
bindplane sync agent-versions --agent-type my-custom-opentelemetry-distro --version v0.0.1
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Note that the version matches the release.
5. Install your custom collector from the Bindplane UI
Now since you’ve added a custom Agent Type and synced a version, you can choose to install it from the Bindplane UI.
Since you built it for Mac, Windows, and Linux, you’ll see all three options when selecting platform.
I want to install it in my Linux VM, so I’ll select Linux and click next.
I’ll get this generic install single-command. Running this in my VM will start my custom collector and hook it up to Bindplane via OpAMP.
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSlL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/observIQ/bindplane-otel-collector/refs/heads/main/scripts/generic-install/install_unix.sh')" install_unix.sh -d 'my-custom-opentelemetry-distro' -u 'https://github.com/adnanrahic/otel-distro-builder-github-action' -e 'wss://app.bindplane.com/v1/opamp' -s '01J06XSD7FVM3CHCQA3823AC2X' -v '0.0.1' -l 'install_id=937a3445-8962-441a-90f0-ee120c67edb7'

Because the OpAMP connection works via websockets, it’ll update the UI right away and show you the collector running.
6. Configure and manage your custom collector from the Bindplane UI
You can now create a configuration for the collector and remote push it down.
Click the Create Configuration button to create and manage a config in Bindplane and apply it remotely.
Give it a name, select the Agent Type for your custom collector, and select the platform where your custom collector is running. For my example, it’s Linux. Add a Telemetry Generator source.
And, a Dev Null destination.
This will finalize your config creation. You still need to connect it to your custom collector.
Click the Add Agents button. Select your custom collector, and hit save.
Now, you can start a rollout to apply the config remotely.
What’s awesome here is that Bindplane reads the collector’s capabilities directly from the build, so you only see the components you actually included in the manifest.
Let me show you by adding a new source.
You’ll see which sources are incompatible are which you can use. This is a huge quality-of-life improvement and convenience across your entire team when creating and managing collector configs.
Step 6 — Iterate with confidence
With this setup you can:
Update the manifest.yaml to add or remove modules
Create a new release
GitHub Actions builds a new version
Deploy or upgrade in your environment
Bindplane instantly manages the updated agent
You now have a BYOC (Bring Your Own Collector) workflow — fully automated, versioned, and controlled by you.
Why this works so well

Future goals
Moving forward I would love to abstract away the manifest.yaml as well. In an ideal world I would want to give the OpenTelemetry Distro Builder a sample collector config file. It should then be able to create a manifest.yaml from my config. This process would abstract away everything except for the specific receivers, exporters, extensions, and processors I really need.
More on this by the end of the year. 😉
Final thoughts
Custom collectors aren’t just for power users anymore. With ODB and GitHub Actions, you can build exactly what you need, package it for every platform, and manage it at scale with Bindplane. All without touching a Go compiler. 🔥
It’s clean. It’s fast. And it’s production-ready.

Very useful tutorial
I really like how you explain trimming the collector binary, using manifest.yaml, and integrating with GitHub Actions + Bindplane.
what’s been your experience around versioning/upgrading safely
how do you ensure backward compatibility when removing or swapping out receivers/exporters in a custom build?

Thanks! Glad you liked it.
I'm not sure backward compatibility is possible if you remove modules or swap them out for versions with breaking changes. You're the last line of defense there IMHO.
I'd say the Git history (+GitHub Releases) is your lifeline for versioning and upgrading. Building a new collector with a new version and release will give it the tar bundle a new name. You can then stop the existing collector, start the new one and validate functionality. If you need to roll back you still have the old bundle with a different version name.
Or, with Bindplane, you get module compatibility in the UI, if you choose to go that route.
