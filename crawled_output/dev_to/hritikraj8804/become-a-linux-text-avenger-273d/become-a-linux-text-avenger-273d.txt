Drowning in gigabytes of log files? Puzzled by complex configs? In the world of DevOps and SRE, the command line isn't just a tool it's your superpower. Mastering text manipulation is the key to debugging, automation, and system administration.
Today, we're diving into a hands-on training simulation: The Linux Text Avengers Training Camp. You'll wield legendary tools like grep, sed, awk, and find to slice through data, uncover critical intel, and save your systems from chaos.
Ready to earn your cape? Let's get started. 🦸‍♀️
Mission Prep: Build Your Base
First, every hero needs a base of operations. Open your terminal and create your lab.
# Create and enter your training directory
mkdir ~/textlab
cd ~/textlab
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Next, create the core intelligence file (myfile.txt) we'll be working with.
cat << EOF > myfile.txt
Line 1: This is a test file. Initializing systems...
Line 2: Administrator access granted. Beware of rogue agents.
Line 3: Memory usage: 500MB. System stable.
Line 4: Error log entry: Unauthorized access attempt detected.
Line 5: IP address: 192.168.1.100. Target server.
Line 6: Password: secret123. DO NOT SHARE.
Line 7: End of file. Mission critical.
EOF
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Finally, let's simulate some enemy activity by creating log files.
mkdir ~/textlab/logs
echo "error: disk full. System compromised!" > ~/textlab/logs/log1.log
echo "ERROR: network down. Communications disrupted!" > ~/textlab/logs/log2.log
echo "warning: low memory. System stability threatened!" >
~/textlab/logs/log3.log
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Operation: Text Manipulation - The Challenges
With our setup complete, it's time to tackle the challenges.
1. Decoding the Intelligence
The Mission: Display line 5 from myfile.txt to find the target IP address.
Method 1: The sed Scalpel
sed (Stream Editor) is perfect for surgical precision.
sed -n '5p' ~/textlab/myfile.txt
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works: The -n flag tells sed to be quiet, and 5p explicitly prints only line 5.
Method 2: The head and tail Combo
Combine two tools for a classic one-liner.
head -n 5 ~/textlab/myfile.txt | tail -n 1
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works: head grabs the first 5 lines, and tail grabs the last line of that output. Simple and effective!
2. Hunting the Target
The Mission: A rogue agent changed "Administrator" to "root". Reverse the sabotage!
First, let's simulate the sabotage: sed -i 's/Administrator/root/' ~/textlab/myfile.txt
Now, the fix:
sed -i 's/root/Administrator/' ~/textlab/myfile.txt
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works: The sed -i command performs an in-place edit. The s/find/replace/ syntax substitutes "root" back to "Administrator" directly in the file. Mission accomplished.
3. Deleting Sensitive Info
The Mission: A password has been compromised! Remove the line containing "Password" from the file immediately.
sed -i '/Password/d' ~/textlab/myfile.txt
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works: Again, we use sed -i for an in-place edit. The script '/Password/d' finds any line containing the pattern and deletes it. The evidence is gone.
4. System Reconnaissance
The Mission: Get a quick overview of memory usage by extracting the 6th column from the process list.
ps aux | awk '{print $6}'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works: ps aux lists all running processes. We pipe | that massive output to awk. awk is a powerful language for processing columnar data. {print $6} tells it to print only the 6th column, which is the Resident Set Size (RSS) the physical memory used by each process.
### 5. Archiving the Evidence
The Mission: Find all large log files (.log > 1MB) and archive them for later analysis.
First, let's make one of our logs big enough:
for i in {1..100000}; do echo "filler line $i" >> ~/textlab/logs/log1.log; done
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now, find and archive it:
find ~/textlab/logs -name "*.log" -size +1M -exec tar -czvf ~/textlab/archived_logs.tar.gz {} +
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How it works:
find ~/textlab/logs: Searches the target directory.
-name "*.log": Looks for files ending in .log.
-size +1M: Filters for files larger than 1 Megabyte.
-exec tar ... {} +: Executes the tar command on all found files ({}). czvf tells tar to create a g*zipped, **verbose archive to the specified **f*ile.
6. Finding the Pattern
The Mission: An alarm is ringing! Count the case-insensitive occurrences of the word "error" in log1.log to gauge the severity.
grep -oi "error" ~/textlab/logs/log1.log | sort | uniq -c
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The Ultimate Pipeline:
grep -oi "error": Finds all occurrences of "error" (case-insensitive) and prints each on its own line.
| sort: Sorts the list of errors. This is a crucial prep step for uniq.
| uniq -c: Counts the unique sorted lines and prints the count.
This one-liner instantly tells you how many of each error type you're dealing with an SRE's best friend during an outage.
Why These Skills Are Your Superpower
You didn't just run some commands; you trained in the core arts of system administration.
Debugging Outages: grep | sort | uniq -c is your go-to for finding the needle in a haystack of logs.
Security Audits: grep "password" or find / -name "*.bak" helps you find insecure files and secrets.
Automation: sed is the engine behind countless scripts that modify configuration files on the fly.
Confidence: Knowing these tools means no system, container, or cloud instance is a black box.
Keep practicing, stay curious, and soon you'll be the one they call when the servers go down.
