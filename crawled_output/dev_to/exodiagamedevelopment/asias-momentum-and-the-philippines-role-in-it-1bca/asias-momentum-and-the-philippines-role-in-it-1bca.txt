Talent is no longer concentrated in a few hubs. With tools, remote collaboration, and outsourcing, the future is everywhere. If your team ships globally, it helps to build globally.
Southeast Asia offers strong art and technical chops, plus ease of collaboration. Iâ€™ve seen fast iteration cycles with PH and VN teams, and reliable tools support out of SG. The surprise benefit: cultural rangeâ€”humor, aesthetics, and player expectations broaden.
Have you shipped with SEA collaborators? What made it smoothâ€”or roughâ€”and what would you change next time?
If youâ€™re curious about how game dev is growing in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, we post updates and behind-the-scenes on FB: Exodia Philippines | IG: _exodiagamedev | TikTok: exodiagamedev.
