Kubernetes & Helm Blog Series: A Journey from Zero to Production

Post 0/10 â€” Foundations: Zero to Base Setup
Kubernetes and Helm have become the backbone of modern DevOps practices, powering everything from small startups to enterprise-scale production environments. But the learning curve can feel steep, especially if youâ€™re new. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve designed this 10-post series (starting from 0 as mentioned in the title, so effectively 11) to guide you step by stepâ€”from absolute foundations to advanced, production-ready strategiesâ€”so that both beginners and seasoned engineers can level up.
Why This Series?
For beginners: youâ€™ll get clear definitions, simple labs, and practical examples that build confidence quickly.
For advanced engineers: youâ€™ll find deeper dives, edge-case discussions, and proven practices used in real-world production clusters.
For everyone: each post has hands-on labs, cheat sheets, and a wrap-up that connects naturally to the next topic.
Series Structure
**Post 0 â€” Foundations: Zero to Base Setup
Get comfortable with the mental model of Kubernetes, YAML hygiene, kubectl basics, local clusters (kind/minikube), and Helm chart structure.
Post 1 â€” Multi-Tenancy & Security Baseline
Learn how Namespaces, ResourceQuotas, NetworkPolicies, and Pod Security Admission set the foundation for safe, shared clusters.
Post 2 â€” Reliability by Design: Probes, PDBs & Topology Spread
Design applications that survive rollouts, disruptions, and node failures with probes, PodDisruptionBudgets, and spread constraints.
Post 3 â€” Upgrades & Feature Gates: Safe Cadence
Master upgrade strategies, manage version skew, and safely evaluate new features.
Post 4 â€” Smart Scaling & Cost Control: HPA, KEDA & Karpenter
Balance elasticity and efficiency using Horizontal Pod Autoscaling, event-driven scaling, Cluster Autoscaler, and Karpenter.
Post 5 â€” Modern Traffic Management with Gateway API
Move beyond Ingress with the Gateway API: flexible routing, retries, mirroring, and multi-tenant gateways.
Post 6 â€” Helm Fundamentals Done Right
Build clean, reusable charts with sane defaults, values schema validation, library charts, and overlays.
Post 7 â€” Helm in CI/CD: Lint, Tests, Diff & Supply Chain Security
Treat charts as code: enforce linting, add unit tests, integrate diffs, push to OCI registries, and secure with provenance.
Post 8 â€” Progressive Delivery & GitOps
Ship confidently with Blue/Green and Canary patterns, GitOps controllers like Argo CD and Flux, and drift detection.
Post 9 â€” Operatorâ€™s Toolkit: Debugging & Power Moves
Sharpen your day-to-day: ephemeral debug containers, kubectl power tips, and Helm Day-2 operations.
Post 10 â€” Whatâ€™s Next: Sidecars, eBPF, AI Gateways & Supply Chain Maturity
Explore the trends shaping Kubernetes: stable sidecars, eBPF-powered networking, AI routing, and SLSA supply-chain practices.
How to Follow Along
Start at Post 0 if youâ€™re new, or jump in at any point if youâ€™re experienced.
Each post builds on the previous, but they also stand alone as practical guides.
Expect plenty of copy-pasteable commands, diagrams to cement understanding, and mini-labs that run in less than 30 minutes.
Bottom line: by the end of this series, youâ€™ll not only understand Kubernetes and Helmâ€”youâ€™ll be confident running, scaling, securing, and modernizing clusters in production. Start's September 23rd, 2025
