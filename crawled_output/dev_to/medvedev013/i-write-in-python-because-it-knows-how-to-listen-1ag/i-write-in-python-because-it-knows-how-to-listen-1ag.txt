🐍 I Write in Python Because It Knows How to Listen
#python
#analytics
#backend
I’m 22.
I’ve been a developer for 6 years.
I’ve coded in Java, C#, JavaScript — even dabbled in Rust.
But every evening, when I close my laptop, I always come back to Python.
Not because it’s fast.
Not because it’s trendy.
But because… it understands me.
🌅 In the morning, I open the terminal
And I type:
name = "Ilya"
print(f"Good morning, {name}. Today will be a good day.")
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
And I feel like… someone answered.
Not a machine.
Not a compiler.
But a friend.
Python doesn’t demand that I declare types first.
It doesn’t require ten lines of boilerplate before I can say:
“Hello, world.”
It just says:
“Alright. Go ahead.”
And I do.
📚 Yesterday, I rewrote an old script
It was simple — pulled data from a CSV, calculated an average, drew a chart.
I wrote it three years ago.
Back then, I was a beginner.
Now, I’m not.
But when I opened the file, I smiled.
All those old comments were still there:
# This is weird, but it works. Don't touch.
# Someone said this isn't allowed — but I checked three times.
# If it breaks, it's not my fault 😅
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I didn’t fix them.
I left them.
Because they’re not code.
They’re my diary.
Python doesn’t force me to be perfect.
It accepts me as I am — with typos, with “don’t touch” notes, with hacks that work.
✨ Sometimes I write code like poetry
def find_hope_in_data(data):
for row in data:
if row.get('status') == 'pending':
yield row['message']
# Someone is waiting for a reply...
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
I know — it’s not “optimal”.
I know — it’s not “clean”.
But when I write this, I feel lighter.
Python doesn’t make me wrap everything in classes.
It doesn’t insist every function must have tests.
It doesn’t whisper: “You should be better.”
It just stands beside me.
Quietly.
Waiting.
💬 And here’s what I love most about how Python handles errors:
>>> print("Hello, world!"
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
It doesn’t shout.
It doesn’t scold.
It doesn’t say: “You’re wrong!”
It simply says:
“You forgot to close the parenthesis. I’m here.”
And I pick up the keyboard again.
And I write again.
It doesn’t judge.
It helps.
🌱 And you know what’s most important?
I don’t work at Google.
I don’t have a PhD.
I haven’t published libraries on PyPI.
I just do what’s needed:
— automate reports for accountants,
— write scripts for my colleagues,
— help newcomers understand that for isn’t scary.
And people thank me.
Not for “cool code”.
But because I made something simple — and it made their life a little easier.
Python doesn’t ask for genius.
It asks for kindness.
❤️ At the end of the day
When I shut down my IDE,
I sometimes stare at the screen and think:
“Thank you, Python.
You never forced me to be someone else.
You let me be myself —
even when my code isn’t perfect.
Even when I don’t know all the tricks.
Even when it’s not a masterpiece.”
I’m not a programmer who writes in Python.
I’m a person who speaks in a language that hears me.
And maybe… that’s the real magic.

📌 *P.S. If you’re sitting in some corner writing scripts no one sees —
but they make someone’s day a little easier —
you’re doing something important.*
And Python knows it.
It always has.

This post won’t teach you how to optimize loops.
It won’t explain async/await.
It won’t show you how to write “clean code.”
But maybe…
it’ll remind you
why you started coding at all.
Not for titles.
Not for salary.
But so that something became a little better.
And Python?
It’s one of the few languages that remembers that.
