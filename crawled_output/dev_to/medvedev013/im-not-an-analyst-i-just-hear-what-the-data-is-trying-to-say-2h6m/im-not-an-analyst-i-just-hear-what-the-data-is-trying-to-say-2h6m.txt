🌿 I’m not an analyst. I just hear what the data is trying to say.
#analytics

#webdev
I work as a freelancer.
Three years.
No office. No templates. No team.
Just me.
And thousands of lines of data — no one else wanted to understand.
People ask me:
“Why are people leaving?”
“Why is conversion so low?”
I don’t look at graphs right away.
First, I open the messages.
The ones buried in “Spam.”
The ones nobody reads.
The ones where people don’t talk about price — they talk about fear:
“I wanted to buy… but I didn’t understand how much it cost. Everything looked nice, but I was afraid to click.”
“I clicked five times. Then closed it. Thought: ‘It’s broken.’ Maybe… I’m not worthy?”
“You didn’t reply for three days. I stopped waiting. Just… got tired.”
I don’t fix problems.
I just translate them — from numbers into heartbeats.
💬 Sometimes I see:
— A button that looks like an ad.
→ People ignore it.
Not because they don’t want to.
But because they don’t trust it.
— A form asking for an email.
→ 80% leave after it.
Not because the product isn’t good.
But because they’re afraid of spam.
— A page with “20% OFF!”
→ Written in tiny font.
→ No one notices.
→ Everyone leaves.
Because they didn’t see hope.
🕯️ I don’t make reports.
I build bridges.
Between what the product wants to say,
and what the user feels.
Between code and humanity.
Between algorithms and pain.
Sometimes I get paid 3,000 rubles for one report.
Sometimes nothing at all.
But when a client writes:
“You’re the only one who told me why they left…
Not just showed me the number.”
—I know:
This is my work.
❤️ I’m not an expert.
I’m just attentive.
I don’t know how to optimize SQL.
I can’t build ML models.
I haven’t read 200-page documentation.
But I know how to:
— Ask: “What if…”
— Listen to the silence between the numbers
— See the person behind every log line
🌱 This isn’t about data.
It’s about trust.
When you see someone hesitate before clicking —
you stop being an analyst.
You become the one who says:
“You’re not alone.
We’re here.
We heard you.”
✨ And do you know what matters most?
I don’t save companies.
I don’t boost revenue by 300%.
I simply return to people the feeling that they are seen.
And sometimes — that’s enough.
For someone to click again.
For someone to believe again.

💌 P.S. If you’re also sitting somewhere in silence, staring at spreadsheets and feeling — there are real people here —
you’re not alone.
You’re the one no one notices.
But without you, nothing works.
Thank you for being here.
You’re making the world a little softer.
A little kinder. 🌷

This post won’t teach you window functions.
Won’t show you how to optimize Pandas.
Won’t explain A/B tests.
But it will remind you of one thing —
the one thing no one says on an interview:
You don’t have to know everything.
You just have to be present —
when someone is waiting to be heard.
And you’re already here.
You’re already doing it.
Just keep going. 🌙
