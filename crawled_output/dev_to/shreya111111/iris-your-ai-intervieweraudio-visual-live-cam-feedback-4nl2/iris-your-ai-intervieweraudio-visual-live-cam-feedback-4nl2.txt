Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
💡 What I Built
Iris is an AI-powered Interview Coach designed to help candidates practice, improve, and excel in interviews.
Instead of reading generic interview guides, Iris creates a personalized interview experience by combining resume understanding, live camera interaction, and structured feedback — powered by Google AI Studio (Gemini multimodal models).
It feels just like a face-to-face mock interview with a professional hiring manager, but available anytime, anywhere.
🌟 Iris Features
📄 Resume Scan – Upload PDF/image, extracts key skills, experience, education & generates a concise summary.
🎤 Live AI Interview – Face-to-face AI interviewer with camera & mic, adapting questions to your resume & responses.
🤖 Personalized Feedback & Coaching – Gets strengths, areas to improve, and STAR method evaluation from your session.
💾 Download Feedback Report – Save detailed feedback as a document.
🔗 Share Progress – Share reports with friends/mentors for collaborative review.
📜 Interview History – Timeline of past interviews with scores & feedback summaries.
📂 Previous Transcripts – View transcripts with questions & answers to track progress over multiple sessions.
🎥 Demo
👉 Video
Note : You might be not able to hear AI Voice in the video because my system is not able to catch system audio when doing screen recording because of some issue. I am attaching the deployed link below so that you can try it out yourself. All you have to do is upload the resume(PDF) format. Avoid using app repeatedly at a particular time frame as it might exhaust the API credits.
