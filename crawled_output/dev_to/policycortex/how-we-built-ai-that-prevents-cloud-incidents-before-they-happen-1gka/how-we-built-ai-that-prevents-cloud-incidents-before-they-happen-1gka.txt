How We Built AI That Prevents Cloud Incidents Before They Happen
#devops

As a former cloud engineer at MITRE and Frontier Airlines, I spent too many nights fighting cloud fires. Surprise bills, compliance violations, security gaps â€” sound familiar?
After one too many 3 AM alerts, my team and I built PolicyCortex: an AI system that predicts and prevents cloud issues before they become incidents.
The Problem We Set Out to Solve
Traditional monitoring is reactive: you get alerts after something breaks. We wanted proactive intelligence that spots problems early and nudges safe fixes into the delivery flow.
Our AI Approach
We combine ML + policy-as-code + lightweight telemetry:
Cost: time-series models flag anomalous spend and predict upcoming spikes.
Security: configuration analytics uncover misconfigurations and risky drift.
Compliance: rules + drift detection prevent violations before they ship.
Performance: early signals (latency, saturation, errors) catch issues upstream.
Real Results (so far)
1,842 incidents prevented across customers
$2.4M+ in cloud costs saved
94.2% average compliance score achieved
$16K+ potential savings identified per customer
These numbers reflect current internal dashboards as of publication.
High-Level Architecture
Time-series forecasting for usage & cost patterns
Anomaly detection on security posture & access drift
Rule engine for policy/compliance guardrails (pre-deploy + runtime)
NLP prioritization to group noisy alerts into actionable stories
Under the hood, we pair proactive checks with gated deployments so risky changes donâ€™t make it to prod. When something does slip, we provide clear flow maps and cheaper, summarized log views so engineers can see whatâ€™s talking to what without burning the budget.
Why This Matters
Fewer wake-ups: prevent incidents instead of paging on symptoms
Lower cloud bills: catch waste and misconfig early
Cleaner audits: show your preventative controls, not just post-mortems
Happier teams: less noise, clearer actions
Whatâ€™s Next
Weâ€™re launching publicly today and would love feedback from the DEV community. The goal: eliminate reactive cloud management.
