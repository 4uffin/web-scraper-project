# Create and Change Directory
mkdir
SSL-SelfSigned-Certs
cd SSL-SelfSigned-Certs
# Create your app1 key:
openssl genrsa -out app1.key 2048
# Create your app1 certificate signing request:
openssl req -new -key app1.key -out app1.csr -subj "/CN=app1.latchudevops.com"
# Create your app1 certificate:
openssl x509 -req -days 7300 -in app1.csr -signkey app1.key -out app1.crt
