Part-66: üö¶ Google Cloud Networking: Cloud Load Balancing (Global & Regional)
#googlecloud

Load balancing is the backbone of highly available, scalable applications. In Google Cloud, Cloud Load Balancing is a fully managed service that automatically distributes traffic to your backend services, ensuring performance, reliability, and global reach.
üåç Global vs Regional Load Balancing
Global Load Balancing
Distributes traffic across multiple regions.
Uses a single anycast IP to route users to the closest healthy backend.
Supports automatic failover between regions.
Regional Load Balancing
Distributes traffic within a single region across zones.
Ensures availability at the regional level.
‚úÖ Both are software-defined ‚Üí no hardware, no manual scaling. Traffic handling grows from zero to full throttle in seconds.
Google Cloud Load Balancing - Types
Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS)
Network Load Balancer (TCP / UDP / Other IP Protocols)
‚ö° Protocols Supported
Layer 7 (Application Load Balancer)
HTTP / HTTPS
Layer 4 (Network Load Balancer - Proxy Mode)
TCP Proxy
SSL Proxy (with SSL offloading)
Layer 4 (Network Load Balancer - Pass-through Mode)
TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6, SCTP, ESP, AH, GRE
üí° Reminder: Each OSI layer builds on the ones below (Layer 7 uses Layers 1‚Äì6).
üß© Key Terminology
üîπ Backend
Services that receive traffic:
Instance Groups
Cloud Storage
App Engine
Cloud Run
GKE
Cloud Functions
Even external backends
üîπ Frontend
Defines IP, port, and protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, etc.)
This is the entry point users access.
üîπ Routing Rules (Application LB)
Path-based routing
stacksimplify.com/app1 ‚Üí App1
stacksimplify.com/app2 ‚Üí App2
Host-based routing
app1.stacksimplify.com ‚Üí App1
app2.stacksimplify.com ‚Üí App2
Rewrites
Host Rewrite: app1.stacksimplify.com ‚Üí app1.terraformguru.com
Path Rewrite: /app1 ‚Üí /app1new
Redirects, header manipulation, URL rewrites and more!
üöÄ Why Use Google Cloud Load Balancing?
High availability across zones, regions, and globally
Scales seamlessly with demand
Low latency with Anycast IP routing
Integrates natively with all major Google Cloud services
