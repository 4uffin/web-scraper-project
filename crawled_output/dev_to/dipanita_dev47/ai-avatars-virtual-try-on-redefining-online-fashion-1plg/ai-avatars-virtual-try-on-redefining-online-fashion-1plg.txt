Google AI Challenge Submission
This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
I built Avatar Virtual Try-On Studio, an innovative fashion technology platform that transforms how people shop for clothes online. The application combines AI-powered avatar generation with realistic virtual try-on capabilities, allowing users to upload their photo, generate a stylized avatar, and virtually try on clothing items with accurate fit analysis based on their measurements.
Overview of My Applet
Avatar Virtual Try-On Studio is a comprehensive fashion visualization platform built with React and TypeScript, leveraging Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model for multimodal AI capabilities. Users can upload their photo to generate personalized avatars in various artistic styles (Hyperrealistic, Anime, Cartoon, Pixel Art, Sci-Fi), then virtually try on clothing items by uploading product images and providing their measurements for accurate fit simulation.
Features
Multi-Style Avatar Generation: Create personalized avatars in 5 different artistic styles using Gemini's image generation capabilities.
Realistic Virtual Try-On: Upload clothing images and see how they look on your avatar with physics-accurate fabric simulation.
Measurement-Based Fit Analysis: Input personal measurements (height, weight, chest, waist, hips) for accurate sizing and fit prediction.
Clothing Detail Analysis: Specify item type, material, fit preference, and additional descriptions for enhanced realism.
Personal Gallery: Save and organize favorite try-on results with persistent local storage.
Multi-Image Clothing Analysis: Upload up to 4 images per clothing item for comprehensive 3D understanding.
Fabric Physics Simulation: AI considers material properties (silk, denim, cotton) for realistic draping and folding.
What Problem It Solves
Online fashion retail faces a critical challenge with return rates exceeding 30%, primarily due to sizing and fit issues. Avatar Virtual Try-On Studio addresses:
Sizing Uncertainty: Eliminates guesswork by providing measurement-based fit analysis.
Visual Representation Gap: Bridges the disconnect between product photos and real-world appearance
Return Rate Reduction: Helps customers make informed decisions, reducing costly returns.

How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio as my primary development partner & coding assistant throughout the entire project lifecycle, utilizing its AI-powered development capabilities to build Avatar Virtual Try-On Studio from an idea to a reality (concept to deployment).
Google AI Studio as my Development Partner
Complete Code Generation: Google AI Studio served as my coding partner, generating 100% of the application code based on my prompts & specifications. I provided detailed requirements for UI components, functionality, & user flow, while the Google AI Studio translated these into production-ready React/TypeScript code.
Interactive Development Process: I used Google AI Studio's conversational interface to iteratively refine the application:
‚Ä¢ Described desired features and user experience flows.
‚Ä¢ Provided feedback on generated code & requested modifications.
‚Ä¢ Tested functionality and reported issues for AI to resolve.
‚Ä¢ Refined UI/UX elements through natural language descriptions.
Multimodal Capabilities Implementation
Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Integration: Collaborated with Google AI Studio to implement sophisticated multimodal features:
‚Ä¢ Avatar Generation Pipeline: Described the need for style based avatar creation, and AI Studio generated the complete implementation using Gemini's image understanding & generation capabilities.
‚Ä¢ Virtual Try-On System: Explained the concept of realistic clothing simulation, and AI Studio created the advanced prompt engineering and multi-image processing system.
‚Ä¢ Fabric Physics Simulation: Discussed the importance of material-specific rendering, leading to AI-generated prompts that consider fabric properties and fit preferences.
Multi-Image Processing Architecture: Through iterative conversations, Google AI Studio built:
‚Ä¢ File handling systems for multiple clothing image uploads.
‚Ä¢ Base64 encoding/decoding utilities for image processing.
‚Ä¢ Error handling and validation for multimodal inputs.
Measurement Integration System: Described the need for personalized fit analysis, resulting in AI-generated:
