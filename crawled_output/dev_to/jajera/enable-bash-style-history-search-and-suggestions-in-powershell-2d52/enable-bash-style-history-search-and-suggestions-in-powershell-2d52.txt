Enable Bash-Style History Search and Suggestions in PowerShell
PowerShell can behave just like Bash with prefix-based history search and inline suggestions. This guide shows how to enable those features in a few simple steps.
Step 1: Check Your PowerShell Version
Run:
$PSVersionTable.PSVersion
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Version 7+ â†’ PSReadLine is already included.
Version 5.1 â†’ install PSReadLine in Step 2.
Step 2: Install PSReadLine (Only for 5.1)
Run PowerShell as Administrator:
Install-Module PSReadLine -Scope CurrentUser -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This installs or updates PSReadLine for your user.
Step 3: Open Your Profile File
Create or edit your profile file:
# Show profile path
$PROFILE
# Create profile if missing
if (!(Test-Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force }
# Open profile in Notepad
notepad $PROFILE
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Add History Search and Suggestions
Paste these lines into your profile:
Import-Module PSReadLine
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle InlineView
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow
-Function HistorySearchBackward
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Save and close Notepad.
Step 5: Restart PowerShell
Close and reopen your PowerShell (or VS Code terminal) to apply changes.
Step 6: Test the Functionality
Run some commands, e.g. echo test
Type ec then press â†‘ â†’ only commands starting with ec will appear.
Inline suggestions will show in gray â€” accept with â†’ or End.
Optional Tweaks
Enable list-style suggestions:
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Increase history size:
Set-PSReadLineOption -MaximumHistoryCount 10000
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Add these lines to your $PROFILE for persistence.
Troubleshooting
Check module and options:
Get-Module PSReadLine
Get-PSReadLineOption
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Ensure PredictionSource is set to History. Restart PowerShell if changes donâ€™t take effect.
Conclusion
With these settings, PowerShell behaves much like Bash, letting you quickly recall previous commands using â†‘/â†“ and see inline suggestions
