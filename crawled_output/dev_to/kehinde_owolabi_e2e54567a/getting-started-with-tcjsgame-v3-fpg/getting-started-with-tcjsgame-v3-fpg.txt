üéÆ Getting Started with TCJSgame v3
TCJSgame v3 is a lightweight JavaScript 2D game engine designed for simplicity and speed.
It‚Äôs perfect for beginners who want to learn game development, but still powerful enough for building custom projects with components, sprites, tilemaps, sounds, and camera controls.
üì¶ 1. Setup
Include the TCJSgame v3 script in your HTML file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>My First TCJSgame v3 Project</title>
</head>
<body>
<script src="tcjsgame-v3.js"></script>
<script>
// we‚Äôll add code here
</script>
</body>
</html>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üñ•Ô∏è 2. Create a Display
The Display class manages the canvas, input events, and rendering loop.
const display = new Display();
display.start(800, 450); // width, height
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This creates a canvas of 800x450 pixels and starts the game loop.
üî≤ 3. Add a Component
A Component is any object in your game: rectangles, images, or text.
let player = new Component(50, 50, "blue", 100, 100, "rect");
display.add(player);
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Here we added a blue rectangle (50x50) at position (100,100).
üéÆ 4. Update Function
Define a global update() function to control the game:
function update() {
// Move with arrow keys
if (display.keys[37]) player.x -= 3; // left
if (display.keys[39]) player.x += 3; // right
if (display.keys[38]) player.y -= 3; // up
if (display.keys[40]) player.y += 3; // down
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now you can move the player with the keyboard!
üé® 5. Add Backgrounds
You can easily set a background:
display.backgroundColor("lightgrey");
// Or gradients:
display.lgradient("right", "skyblue", "white");
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üñºÔ∏è 6. Sprites
Use animated sprites:
let img = new Image();
img.src = "spritesheet.png";
let hero = new Sprite(img, 64, 64, 4, 10);
// frameWidth, frameHeight, frameCount, frameSpeed
function update() {
hero.update();
hero.draw(display.context, 200, 200);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üß± 7. Tilemaps
v3 introduces TileMap support:
display.map = [
[1,1,0,0],
[0,1,1,0],
[0,0,1,1]
];
display.tile = [
new Component(32, 32, "green", 0, 0, "rect")
];
display.tileMap();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This draws a simple 3x4 grid using the green tiles.
üîä 8. Sounds
let music = new Sound("background.mp3");
music.play();
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
üé• 9. Camera System
The camera can follow a target:
display.camera.follow(player, true); // smooth follow
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
‚öôÔ∏è 10. Putting It All Together
<script src="tcjsgame-v3.js"></script>
<script>
const display = new Display();
display.start(800, 450);
let player = new Component(50, 50, "red", 100, 100, "rect");
display.add(player);
function update() {
if (display.keys[37]) player.x -= 3;
if (display.keys[39]) player.x += 3;
if (display.keys[38]) player.y -= 3;
if (display.keys[40]) player.y += 3;
}
</script>
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Run it, and you‚Äôve got a working game loop with movement!
‚úÖ Next Steps
Try adding gravity and physics = true to components.
Experiment with spritesheets for animated characters.
Build tilemap levels for platformers or RPGs.
Use camera follow to create scrolling worlds.
üéâ Conclusion
TCJSgame v3 takes the simplicity of v2 and expands it with tilemaps, scenes, camera controls, and improved rendering.
It‚Äôs not just a teaching tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a real game engine you can use to build complete 2D games in JavaScript.
