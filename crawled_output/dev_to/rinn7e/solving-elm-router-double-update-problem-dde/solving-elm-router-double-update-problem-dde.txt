Solving Elm Router "Double Update" Problem
#elm
#functional
I found some older discussions on this issue, but they did not really provide a clear answer:
Understanding the "double update" behavior of Browser.application
Routing when you are already there
It turns out I discovered a simple solution, so I am writing it down in case I forget, or in case someone else finds it useful.
Imagine we have an expensive parseAppRoute function that performs many effects. We do not want it to run twice: once for Navigate and again for UrlChanged. (I am ignoring LinkClicked in this explanation, since in my app I only use Navigate, but the principle is the same.)
The idea is to keep track of a boolean flag called isInternal that indicates whether the URL change originated from inside the app or from an external action such as the browser's back/forward buttons. By default this flag is False, because back/forward navigation can happen at any time.
Whenever I change the route from inside the app, I set isInternal to True. Then, when the follow-up UrlChanged message arrives, I check the flag:
If it is True, I ignore the message and reset the flag to False.
If it is False, I know the change came from the browser (back/forward), so I call parseAppRoute.
This way we avoid calling handling the route change twice.
On initial page load, the route is handled in init, so there is no issue there either.
Here is an example implementation:
parseAppRoute : String -> (Route, Cmd Msg)
parseAppRoute url =
let
newRoute = urlStringToRoute url
in
(newRoute, getCmdFrom newRoute)
cmdFromRoute : Route -> Cmd Msg
cmdFromRoute route =
-- perform expensive side effects
init : Flags -> Url -> Nav.Key -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init _ url key =
let
(initRoute, initCmd) = parseAppRoute url
in
( { route = initRoute
, isInternal = False
, key = key
}
, initCmd
)
-- UPDATE
update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
case msg of
UrlChanged url ->
if model.isInternal then
-- Ignore the UrlChanged that we triggered ourselves;
-- then reset the flag.
( { model | isInternal = False }, Cmd.none )
else
-- Triggered by browser back/forward navigation
let
(newRoute, newCmd) = parseAppRoute url
in
( { model | route = newRoute }, newCmd )
Navigate route ->
let
href = toUrlString route
newRouteCmd = cmdFromRoute route
in
( { model
| isInternal = True -- Mark this as an internal change
, route = route
}
, Cmd.batch [ Nav.pushUrl model.key href, newRouteCmd ]
)
LinkClicked req ->
case req of
Browser.Internal url ->
-- Treat internal clicks like Navigate
let
(newRoute, newCmd) =
parseAppRoute url
in
( { model | isInternal = True, route = newRoute }
, Cmd.batch
[ Nav.pushUrl model.key (Url.toString url)
, newCmd
]
)
Browser.External href ->
( model, Nav.load href )
None ->
( model, Cmd.none )

I hope to hear from others if they reach the same conclusion. Feel free to ask me anything as well.

Nice fix! Using the isInternal flag is smart
