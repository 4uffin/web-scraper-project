AI Can‚Äôt Fix Hiring Alone ‚Äî Here‚Äôs Why I Built Experts Circle

I‚Äôve been a software engineer for over 19 years, and in that time I‚Äôve seen hiring from all angles ‚Äî as a candidate, as a hiring manager, and as someone building platforms. The process has always felt broken: too many irrelevant resumes, too many good people lost in keyword filters, and too little real understanding of what makes someone a good fit.
When AI hiring tools started appearing, I had hope. But I quickly realised they weren‚Äôt solving the problem ‚Äî they were amplifying it. AI can process resumes faster, but it can‚Äôt replace human judgment. It doesn‚Äôt understand the nuance of a team‚Äôs culture, or why one developer with slightly ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù experience might be exactly who you need.
That gap ‚Äî between automation and real human insight ‚Äî is what pushed me to build Experts Circle. The idea is simple: let AI handle the scale and logistics, but keep experts in the loop. Subject-matter experts (engineers, designers, specialists) vet and recommend candidates. AI helps shortlist and organise, but the endorsements come from people who actually understand the work.
This way, employers get trusted, expert-vetted candidates. Candidates get a fairer shot. And experts themselves are rewarded for their insight and networks.
I believe the future of hiring isn‚Äôt AI replacing recruiters ‚Äî it‚Äôs AI + human expertise working together. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre building at Experts Circle.
I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts: have you seen AI help or hurt in hiring, and where do you think the ‚Äúhuman touch‚Äù is still non-negotiable?
