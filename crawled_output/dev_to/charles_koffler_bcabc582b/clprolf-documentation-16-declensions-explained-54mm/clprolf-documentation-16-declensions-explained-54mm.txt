Clprolf Docs #1 — Declensions Explained
#architecture
#designpatterns
#tutorial
📝 This article is part of the official Clprolf documentation series (1/6).
Clprolf is a new programming language and framework that adds clarity to OOP by enforcing roles, responsibilities, and clean design.
Clprolf is a language and framework that helps you design objects with a single, explicit responsibility.
By assigning each class a role (also called its declension), you ensure compliance with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
Objects become components, and this clarity remains intact even with inheritance.
What Is a Declension?
A declension expresses the nature of a class — its fundamental role in the system.
Clprolf defines only a few basic roles, which keeps design unambiguous and intuitive.
The five available declensions are:
agent
Synonyms: simu_agent, simu_real_world_obj, simu_real_obj, abstraction.
worker_agent
Synonyms: simu_comp_as_worker, comp_as_worker.
model
Synonyms: model_real_world_obj, model_real_obj.
information
(no synonyms).
indef_obj
A flexible object without explicit role, behaving like a traditional OO class.
Business-Like Objects
These objects represent real-world abstractions or domain concepts.
agent: the active actor.
agent emphasizes action.
simu_real_obj emphasizes simulation.
abstraction emphasizes conceptual encapsulation (e.g., a Connection, a Socket).
simu_agent highlights simulation of a real-world agent (e.g., an employee).
simu_real_obj: a micro-simulation of a real-world entity.
Example: a Giraffe class with states and behaviors simulating how a giraffe acts.
abstraction: for abstract concepts and system elements (connections, sockets, system utilities).
model: a passive entity with no behavior — just attributes.
Example: a Customer with fields but no methods.
Technical Objects
These objects handle purely computational or support tasks.
Here, the computer itself is seen as the actor.
worker_agent: the computer as a worker executing algorithms.
Synonyms: comp_as_worker, simu_comp_as_worker.
information: a coherent data container, used by workers in algorithms.
⚠️ Unlike model, it does not represent a real-world entity, only technical data.
Examples: system utilities, DAOs, repositories, low-level services, or MVC view components.
Declensions and Genders
Declensions can be refined with genders (optional sub-roles).
They may also have synonyms:
@Expert_component = @Human_expert = @Design_role
@GUI_role = @Machine_tool
@Active_agent (no synonym)
@Static = @Expert_component_static = @Human_expert_static
@Static for worker_agent (no synonym)
⚠️ Genders apply only to agents, except @Static, which may also apply to worker_agent.
Interrelationships Between Declensions
Agents and Workers
Every agent can also act as a worker (computers execute agents as workers).
But explicit workers should be minimized for clarity.
Models and Information
A model can be represented as information (stored as data),
but information should not replace a model.
Unidirectional Substitutions
Agent → Worker ✅
Worker → Agent ❌
Model → Information ✅
Information → Model ❌
These reversals usually reveal a design flaw or a deliberate reinterpretation.
Interfaces and Declensions
Interfaces also have declensions:
compat_interf_version = version_inh
compat_interf_capacity = capacity_inh
compat_interf (no synonym)
Declensions on interfaces specify which classes are allowed to implement them.
Capacity interfaces can also have a gender called Advice:
@For_agent_like
@For_worker_like
Inheritance Consistency
Clprolf enforces that inheritance stays role-consistent:
Business and technical objects cannot be mixed in the same hierarchy.
Synonyms of a declension are accepted.
Exceptions may be forced with @Forced_inh.
Using Declensions
In pure Clprolf, the declension replaces the class keyword.
In the framework, it appears as an annotation above the class.
Example:
@Agent
public class Animal { ... }
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Algorithm for Choosing a Declension
Every class must declare a role.
Step 1 – Does the class have methods?
Yes → it is active → choose @Agent or @Worker_agent.
No → it is passive → use @Model (entity) or @Information (technical container).
Step 2 – Is the responsibility business-related or technical?
Business logic or expert knowledge → @Agent.
Technical or support layer → @Worker_agent.
Example: System Class in Java
At first sight: @Worker_agent (low-level, technical).
But Clprolf favors @Agent whenever possible.
System could also be seen as:
@Abstraction — since “the system” is a conceptual entity.
@Agent(Role.EXPERT_COMPONENT) — as an expert component representing the environment.
Summary
Declensions make objects into components with explicit roles.
Roles clarify responsibilities, improve readability, and ensure inheritance coherence.
Synonyms keep flexibility while preserving consistency.
Result: a simpler, more maintainable system, where every object is clearly positioned.
Notice
If the class already fits one of the well-known architectural categories, you can directly assign a matching role:
A service → @Agent
A helper → @Agent or @Worker_agent (often with Role.STATIC)
A DAO or repository → @Worker_agent
A controller → @Agent
