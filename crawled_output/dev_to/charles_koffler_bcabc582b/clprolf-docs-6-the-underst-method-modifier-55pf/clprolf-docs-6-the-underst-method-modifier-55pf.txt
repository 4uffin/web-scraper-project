Clprolf Docs #6 ‚Äî The underst Method Modifier
#algorithms

üìù This article is part of the official Clprolf documentation series (6/6).
Clprolf is a new programming language and framework that adds clarity to OOP by enforcing roles, responsibilities, and clean design.
The underst modifier (@Underst in the Clprolf framework) is used to mark methods whose implementation is not straightforward.
It highlights algorithms that are non-trivial, where the way a computer solves a task is different from how a human would naturally reason about it.
Purpose
underst means ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù.
It shows that the method exists to make the computer understand a process that is not directly intuitive.
It applies to both agents and worker_agents.
Even with human-like algorithms (such as those written in Algol-like languages), it is sometimes tricky to express jobs for the computer.
A classical example is sorting: while humans sort in a very direct way, computers need a step-by-step algorithm.
Example: Bubble Sort
Consider the bubble sort algorithm.
A human expert would probably take the largest elements and move them directly to the top in one pass.
A computer, however, is taught to repeatedly compare and swap pairs of elements until no more changes are needed.
This approach is efficient for the computer, but it is not the intuitive human way.
Therefore, the method should be marked with underst to indicate that the implementation is more technical than natural.
In Clprolf
public agent BubbleSorter {
private int[] theElements;
public int[] getElements() {
return this.theElements;
}
public BubbleSorter(int[] theArray) {
this.theElements = theArray;
}
public underst void sort() {
// Non-trivial algorithm here
}
}

In the Clprolf Java Framework
@Agent
public class BubbleSorter {
private int[] theElements;
public int[] getElements() {
return this.theElements;
}
public BubbleSorter(int[] theArray) {
this.theElements = theArray;
}
@Underst
public void sort() {
// Non-trivial algorithm here
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Benefits
Clarity ‚Äì At a glance, readers know that the method contains a non-trivial algorithm.
Consistency ‚Äì In Clprolf, either methods are straightforward (unmarked), or they are explicitly marked underst.
Transparency ‚Äì Even less intuitive code has a clear purpose: make the computer understand.
Design Philosophy
Behind the underst modifier lies Clprolf‚Äôs philosophy of keeping implementations simple and explicit:
Straightforward code is left unmarked.
More technical, non-intuitive code is clearly marked with underst.
This ensures that all Clprolf code remains understandable, regardless of its complexity.
