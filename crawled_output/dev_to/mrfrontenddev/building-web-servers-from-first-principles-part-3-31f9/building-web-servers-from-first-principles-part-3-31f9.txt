Building Web Servers from First Principles (Part 7)
In Chapter 2, we built routing with nested switch statements. It worked, but imagine explaining that approach to a frontend developer: "Just add more nested switch cases for every new endpoint." They'd think we were crazy!
Today, we'll solve this by building a proper router - a separate component that handles all the routing logic, just like Express.js does with app.get() and app.post().
What We've Built So Far
From the previous chapters, we have:
✅ A basic HTTP server that listens for requests
✅ Path-based routing using switch statements
❌ Nested switch statements that are hard to maintain
❌ No clean way to register routes dynamically
The Problem with Our Current Approach
Let's first look at where our nested switch approach leads us. Here's what our ServeHTTP method looks like when extended with proper HTTP method support:
func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
path := r.URL.Path
log.Printf("%s %s", r.Method, path)
w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain; charset=utf-8")
w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
switch r.Method {
case http.MethodGet:
GET(path, w)
case http.MethodPost:
POST(path, w)
default:
not_Supported(w)
}
}
func GET(path string, w http.ResponseWriter) {
switch path {
case "/hello":
hello(w)
case "/goodbye":
goodbye(w)
case "/time":
getTime(w)
default:
welcome(w)
}
}
func POST(path string, w http.ResponseWriter) {
switch path {
case "/hello":
post_hello(w)
case "/messages":
messages(w)
case "/time":
post_getTime(w)
default:
post_welcome(w)
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This approach has several problems:
Scattered Logic: Route definitions are spread across multiple functions
Hard to Extend: Adding new HTTP methods requires new functions
No Dynamic Registration: You can't programmatically add routes
Poor Organization: Unlike app.get('/users', handler) in Express
Understanding What Frameworks Do
When you use Express.js, you write:
app.get('/users', getUsersHandler)
app.post('/users', createUserHandler)
app.put('/users/:id', updateUserHandler)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Or with Gin in Go:
r.GET("/users", getUsersHandler)
r.POST("/users", createUserHandler)
r.PUT("/users/:id", updateUserHandler)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What's happening under the hood? The framework stores these routes in a data structure and matches incoming requests against them. Let's build our own version.
Designing Our Router
We need a router that can:
Register routes with method + path + handler
Match incoming requests to the right handler
Execute the matched handler or return 404
Let's start by designing the data structure. We need to store routes by HTTP method and path:
routes = {
"GET": {
"/hello": helloHandler,
"/users": getUsersHandler
},
"POST": {
"/users": createUserHandler,
"/messages": messagesHandler
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Building the Router Component
Create a new file router.go:
package main
import (
"fmt"
"log"
"net/http"
)
type HandlerFunc func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
type Router struct {
routes map[string]map[string]HandlerFunc
}
func NewRouter() *Router {
return &Router{
routes: make(map[string]map[string]HandlerFunc),
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Key Design Decisions:
HandlerFunc type: This matches the signature that handlers need - access to both response and request
Nested maps: map[method]map[path]handler gives us fast O(1) lookup
Pointer receiver: We'll modify the router's state when adding routes
Adding Route Registration Methods
Now let's add the methods that let us register routes (like Express's app.get()):
func (r *Router) addRoute(method string, path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
if r.routes[method] == nil {
r.routes[method] = make(map[string]HandlerFunc)
}
r.routes[method][path] = handler
}
func (r *Router) GET(path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
r.addRoute(http.MethodGet, path, handler)
}
func (r *Router) POST(path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
r.addRoute(http.MethodPost, path, handler)
}
func (r *Router) PUT(path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
r.addRoute(http.MethodPut, path, handler)
}
func (r *Router) PATCH(path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
r.addRoute(http.MethodPatch, path, handler)
}
func (r *Router) DELETE(path string, handler HandlerFunc) {
r.addRoute(http.MethodDelete, path, handler)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Now we can register routes just like in frameworks:
router.GET("/hello", helloHandler)
router.POST("/users", createUserHandler)
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Implementing Route Resolution
The router needs to match incoming requests to handlers:
func (r *Router) resolveRoute(req *http.Request) (HandlerFunc, error) {
method := req.Method
path := req.URL.Path
log.Printf("%s %s", method, path)
methodRoutes, ok := r.routes[method]
if !ok {
return nil, fmt.Errorf("method not supported")
}
handler, ok := methodRoutes[path]
if !ok {
return nil, fmt.Errorf("path does not exist")
}
return handler, nil
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Making the Router Handle HTTP Requests
Our router needs to implement the http.Handler interface so it can handle requests:
func (r *Router) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
handler, err := r.resolveRoute(req)
if err != nil {
w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
w.Write([]byte("route not found"))
return
}
handler(w, req)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This is beautiful - our router finds the right handler and calls it, or returns 404 if no match is found.
Updating Our Server to Use the Router
Now we need to integrate the router into our server. Update server.go:
package main
import (
"log"
"net/http"
)
type Server struct {
Addr
string
Router *Router
server *http.Server
}
func NewServer(addr string) *Server {
router := NewRouter()
server := &Server{
Addr:
addr,
Router: router,
}
return server
}
func (s *Server) Start() {
s.server = &http.Server{
Addr:
s.Addr,
Handler: s,
}
log.Println("Server starting at", s.Addr)
err := s.server.ListenAndServe()
if err != nil {
log.Fatal(err)
}
}
func (s *Server) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
s.Router.ServeHTTP(w, r)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What changed?
Server now has a Router field
NewServer creates a router instance
ServeHTTP delegates to the router instead of handling routing itself
Creating Handler Functions
We need to update our handler functions to match our new HandlerFunc signature:
func welcome(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("Welcome to our Go Webserver!"))
}
func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
}
func goodbye(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("Goodbye, see you later!"))
}
func getTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
message := fmt.Sprintf("Current Time: %s", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05"))
w.Write([]byte(message))
}
func post_hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("Hello via POST!"))
}
func messages(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("You posted a new message"))
}
func post_getTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("POST request received on /time"))
}
func post_welcome(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
w.Write([]byte("Welcome to our Go Webserver from POST!"))
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Note: We added the *http.Request parameter to each handler. Now our handlers have access to the full request information.
Registering Routes
Update main.go to register our routes using the new router API:
package main
import (
"fmt"
"net/http"
"time"
)
func main() {
server := NewServer(":3000")
setupRoutes(server)
server.Start()
}
func setupRoutes(s *Server) {
s.Router.GET("/", welcome)
s.Router.GET("/hello", hello)
s.Router.GET("/goodbye", goodbye)
s.Router.GET("/time", getTime)
s.Router.POST("/", post_welcome)
s.Router.POST("/hello", post_hello)
s.Router.POST("/messages", messages)
s.Router.POST("/time", post_getTime)
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Look how clean this is! It reads just like Express or Gin route definitions.
Testing Our New Router
Let's test our router-based server:
go run .
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Test different routes and methods:
# GET routes
curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/hello
curl http://localhost:3000/goodbye
curl http://localhost:3000/time
# POST routes
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/hello
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/messages
# Test 404s
curl http://localhost:3000/nonexistent
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/hello
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Expected behavior:
GET and POST routes work as expected
Unknown paths return "route not found"
Unsupported methods return "route not found"
What We've Accomplished
We now have:
✅ Clean route registration (like Express/Gin)
✅ Separation of concerns (routing logic separated from server logic)
✅ HTTP method awareness (GET vs POST behave differently)
✅ Proper error handling (404 for unknown routes)
✅ Scalable architecture (easy to add new routes)
Current Limitations
Our router is much better, but still has some limitations:
1. No Dynamic Routes
We can't handle /users/123 or /products/456 - each route must be exactly defined.
2. No Middleware Support
Real APIs need logging, authentication, CORS, etc. We have no way to add these cross-cutting concerns.
3. Basic Error Responses
Our 404 response is just plain text - real APIs return JSON error responses.
What's Next?
In Chapter 4, we'll tackle the biggest limitation - dynamic routes. We'll enable routes like /users/:id and /products/:category/:id, and learn how to extract those parameters in our handlers.
This will bring us much closer to production-ready routing that can handle real API requirements.
Challenge: Try adding some new routes using different HTTP methods. Add a DELETE route for /users and a PUT route for /messages. See how easy it is now compared to our switch statement approach!
