Building Ali≈ç: How I Shipped an App with AI Tools

A couple of weeks ago, I launched Ali≈ç ‚Äî a tiny iPhone app for meditation. The idea is simple: open the app, tap Start, and you‚Äôre meditating in three seconds.
Instead of talking about the product itself, I want to share the process. Because everything ‚Äî the app, the website, even the launch materials ‚Äî was built with the help of AI tools.
From Idea to Prototype in Days
The frustration that sparked Ali≈ç was simple: most meditation apps felt heavy. Sign-ups, subscriptions, course selections‚Ä¶ all before you even get to breathe. I wanted the opposite: just one Start button.
So I opened Windsurf, my AI-powered coding editor, and started prompting:
‚ÄúCreate a minimal iOS app with one Start button.‚Äù
‚ÄúAdd a screen with settings.‚Äù
‚ÄúKeep the design clean and distraction-free.‚Äù
Within a few evenings, I had a working prototype in SwiftUI. Not perfect ‚Äî but good enough to test the vibe.
Writing and Design Without Bottlenecks
I‚Äôm not a designer or a copywriter, so normally this part slows me down. But here‚Äôs what I did:
Used ChatGPT for App Store descriptions, Product Hunt blurbs, and LinkedIn posts.
Generated translations into several languages.
Even the app icon was AI-generated.
What used to take weeks of back-and-forth took just a few hours.
The Website, Simplified
For the landing page, I went back to Windsurf:
‚ÄúAdd a section with a headline, subtitle, and a download button.‚Äù
‚ÄúKeep it minimal ‚Äî one page, no clutter.‚Äù
After a few iterations, I had a website that felt right for Ali≈ç: calm, simple, focused.
What This Experience Taught Me
The biggest lesson: one person can now ship a complete product ‚Äî code, design, copy, everything.
Not because you‚Äôre suddenly an expert in every area, but because AI fills the gaps:
Windsurf handled coding and UI iterations.
ChatGPT covered copy, translations, and visual assets.
That was enough to keep momentum and avoid getting stuck.
Key Takeaways
Don‚Äôt wait. With AI tools, validating ideas is faster than making excuses.
Think in prompts. Clearer prompts = closer to done.
Focus on the essence. Let tools handle surface-level work so you can focus on the core.
Final Thoughts
Ali≈ç is a small project, but it showed me something important: if you have an idea, there‚Äôs really nothing stopping you from launching anymore.
If you‚Äôre sitting on an idea, try pushing it through Windsurf and ChatGPT. A week from now, you might have a working product instead of just a note in your backlog.
