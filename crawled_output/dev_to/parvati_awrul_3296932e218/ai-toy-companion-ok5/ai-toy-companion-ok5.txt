Google AI Challenge Submission
*This is a submission for AI Toy Companion the(https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1uoVd69qmdyCLy-Ju1v1681cUWT4myEdD)
What I Built
I built an AI Toy Companion ‚Äî a magical app that turns any toy photo into a living, talking, and smiling virtual friend.
This companion isn‚Äôt just a chatbot ‚Äî it‚Äôs a multimodal experience powered by Google AI Studio that makes toys come alive with voice, actions, and stories.
Here‚Äôs what it can do:
See & Understand: Upload any toy photo, and the AI describes it in simple, playful words.
Talk & Listen: The toy responds in a cheerful, child-like voice to text or voice commands.
Act & Animate: Commands like ‚Äúdance‚Äù, ‚Äújump‚Äù, or ‚Äúbe happy‚Äù trigger fun cartoon-style animations.
Tell Stories: On request, the toy invents short, imaginative stories with matching visuals.
Stay Positive: If asked to do something sad (like ‚Äúcry‚Äù), the toy gently refuses and instead does something joyful (like smiling or hugging).
Why it‚Äôs special:
This project focuses on fun + safety + imagination. It transforms ordinary toys into interactive companions that always spread positivity, making it delightful for kids and even nostalgic for adults.

How I Used Google AI Studio
I used Google AI Studio to bring my AI Toy Companion to life.
Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash understood toy images and user commands.
I created a prompt system that gives two things every time:
A playful reply from the toy (text + voice).
An image generation prompt so the toy can act (like dancing, jumping, smiling).
For voice interaction, I used Speech-to-Text to understand users and Text-to-Speech to give the toy its own voice.
For visuals, I used Imagen/Veo to generate fun cartoon-style images and animations of the toy.
Finally, I deployed everything with Cloud Run so people can try it live.
With Google AI Studio‚Äôs multimodal power, the toy is no longer just a photo ‚Äî it can see, talk, act, and even perform in generated images .
Multimodal Features
My AI Toy Companion uses multiple AI modes together to create a fun and interactive experience:
Image Understanding ‚Üí The AI looks at toy photos and describes them in simple words.
Voice Interaction ‚Üí Users can give commands by speaking, and the toy replies back in a playful voice.
Action Generation ‚Üí Every command creates a short image/video prompt so the toy can perform actions like dancing, jumping, or smiling in cartoon style.
Storytelling & Emotions ‚Üí The toy can tell short stories or show happy/angry expressions, making it feel alive.
Positive Twist ‚Üí For negative commands (like ‚Äúcry‚Äù), the toy gently changes it into something positive (like ‚Äúsmile‚Äù or ‚Äúhug‚Äù).
These multimodal features make the toy feel more like a real companion ‚Äî it can see, listen, talk, act, and express emotions, which is far more engaging than a normal chatbot
Since I built this project alone, this is an individual submission (no team members).
Thank You
