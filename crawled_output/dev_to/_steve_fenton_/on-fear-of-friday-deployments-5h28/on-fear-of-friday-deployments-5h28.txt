On Fear of Friday Deployments
#cicd
#software
Khalil Gibran (1883‚Äì1931) wrote Fear, a poem that explores how we might overcome our fear by thinking of ourselves as a river that flows into an ocean. The river doesn‚Äôt disappear, it becomes something bigger.
Well, last Friday at lunchtime, I shared that I had deployed twice already that day. Lots of people say you shouldn‚Äôt deploy on Friday, but I‚Äôve thought about this deeply, and I don‚Äôt agree that this should be classed as a best practice.
Well, if a rational approach doesn‚Äôt work for you and the power of poems like Gibran‚Äôs Fear are an indication of reaching a more emotional connection to a message, let‚Äôs explore this topic once again.
No Fear of Friday Deployments
By Steve Fenton
Inspired by Khalil Gibran and styled after the inspirational speech moment in a Danny Boyle film.
It is said that before deploying on Friday,
a developer trembles with fear
Fear of the weekend breaking
fear of the pager‚Äôs midnight song
fear of users lost in digital darkness
while they sleep peacefully unaware
But I say to you:
What is this fear but a shadow
cast by practices of old?
For you have built your fortress
with the stones of automation
tests that run like faithful sentries
pipelines that flow like rivers
carrying your code safely to the ocean
You have monitoring as your eyes
redeploys as your swift retreat
feature flags as your gentle gates
that open and close at will
The ancient ways whispered:
‚ÄúDeploy only when the sun is high
and when all hands are upon the deck.‚Äù
But Continuous Delivery proclaims:
‚ÄúEvery moment is sacred,
every commit a deliberate call
answered with the confident shout of automation.‚Äù
Fear not the Friday
for your code has already walked
through valleys of testing
crossed deserts of integration
and emerged clean in the oasis
of your staging environment
What is Friday but another day
when your practices prove their worth?
What is deployment but breathing
natural, essential, unafraid?
Deploy, then, with confidence.
Let your software flow like water
finding its way to users
who wait unknowing
for the gift of your creation
For in the end
it is not the day that determines fate
but the discipline of your craft
and the wisdom of your tools.
