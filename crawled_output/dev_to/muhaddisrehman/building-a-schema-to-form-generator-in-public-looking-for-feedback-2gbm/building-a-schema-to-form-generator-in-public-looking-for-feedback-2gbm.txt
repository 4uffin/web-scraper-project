Building a Schema-to-Form Generator in Public ‚Äî Looking for Feedback
TL;DR
I‚Äôm starting work on a tool that generates fully validated, production-ready forms from whatever developers already have ‚Äî TypeScript interfaces, JSON schema, Zod, Yup, or even no schema at all.
I‚Äôll be building in public and sharing progress.
The Problem
Forms are boring to build but critical to get right.
You often write a schema and a form separately
Validations and conditional logic get duplicated
Switching frameworks or validation libraries is painful
My Vision
Create a tool where you:
Select your input type (TS interface, JSON, JSON Schema, Zod, Yup ‚Äî or no schema)
Define or paste your data shape
Choose your output (React Hook Form + Zod, Formik, React Final Form, plain HTML+TS)
Get generated code: form + schema + validation rules, ready to use
Early Workflow Idea
Onboarding: One-time setup to pick your preferred stack (framework + validation lib + form management lib)
Input: Paste your schema or create fields visually
Rules: Add conditional logic, regex, min/max rules
Output: Generate form code + validation schema, copy or download
Why Build in Public
I want to validate this idea with real developers before going too deep.
I‚Äôll share:
Design sketches (Figma)
Code architecture decisions
Wins and failures
I‚Äôd Love to Hear Your Feedback:
What input type you usually start with (TS, Zod, JSON?)
Which framework you use (React Hook Form, Formik, Vue, Angular?)
Any examples of tricky validations you‚Äôd want supported
Follow along at auto-form-generator.com or here on DEV.to ‚Äî I‚Äôll be posting updates.
Feedback Hub
I‚Äôve set up a public feedback board where you can:
Suggest Features ‚Äî new input/output formats, integrations
Report Bugs ‚Äî once the MVP is live
Share Real Schemas ‚Äî so I can test against real-world data

Is this a good UX for onboarding someone and the initial configuration? This would be a one time thing.

Really interesting idea, Muhaddis üëè ‚Äî I can definitely see this solving a pain point many devs face. The biggest struggle for me has always been keeping validation rules in sync across schemas and forms, so having a single source of truth that generates both is üî•.
I‚Äôm especially curious how you‚Äôll handle complex conditional logic (e.g., fields that appear only if another field has a certain value) and nested schemas. If you get that right, this tool could save teams a ton of repetitive work.
