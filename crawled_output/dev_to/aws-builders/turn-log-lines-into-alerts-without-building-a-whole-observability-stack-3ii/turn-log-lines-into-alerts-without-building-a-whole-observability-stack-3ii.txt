Turn log lines into alerts (without building a whole observability stack)
#cloudwatch
#observability
#monitoring
#aws
Cold truth: problems always show up in logs first. The trick is turning those “uh-oh” lines into a nudge in your inbox before users feel it.
Here’s the dead-simple pattern I use in AWS:
CloudWatch Logs → Metric Filter → Alarm → SNS (Email/Slack)
No new services to run. No extra agents. Just wiring.
Why this works
Think of CloudWatch Logs as a river. Metric filters are little nets you drop in: “catch anything that looks like ERROR” or “grab JSON where level=ERROR and service=payments.” Each catch bumps a metric. Alarms watch that metric and boom; email, Slack, PagerDuty, whatever you like.
Cheap. Fast. No app changes.
App → CloudWatch Logs ──(metric filter)──▶ Metric
│
└──▶ Alarm ──▶ SNS ──▶ Email/Slack
Step 1: create an SNS topic (so you get alerted)
aws sns create-topic --name app-alarms
# copy the "TopicArn" from the output
TOPIC_ARN="arn:aws:sns:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:app-alarms"
# subscribe your email (confirm the email to activate)
aws sns subscribe \
--topic-arn "$TOPIC_ARN" \
--protocol email \
--notification-endpoint you@example.com
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: add a metric filter to your log group
Option A — simple keyword (“ERROR” but not health checks):
LOG_GROUP="/aws/lambda/my-fn"
aws logs put-metric-filter \
--log-group-name "$LOG_GROUP" \
--filter-name "ErrorCount" \
--filter-pattern '"ERROR" -HealthCheck' \
--metric-transformations \
metricName=ErrorCount,metricNamespace="App/Alerts",metricValue=1,defaultValue=0
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Option B — structured JSON logs (recommended):
aws logs put-metric-filter \
--log-group-name "$LOG_GROUP" \
--filter-name "PaymentsErrors" \
--filter-pattern '{ $.level = "ERROR" && $.service = "payments" }' \
--metric-transformations \
metricName=PaymentsErrorCount,metricNamespace="App/Alerts",metricValue=1
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: create an alarm on that metric
Alert if we see ≥ 1 error per minute for 3 minutes:
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
--alarm-name "LambdaErrorBurst" \
--metric-name ErrorCount \
--namespace "App/Alerts" \
--statistic Sum \
--period 60 \
--evaluation-periods 3 \
--threshold 1 \
--comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
--treat-missing-data notBreaching \
--alarm-actions "$TOPIC_ARN" \
--ok-actions "$TOPIC_ARN"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
That treat-missing-data=notBreaching bit keeps you from getting “we’re fine!” alerts when traffic is quiet
Step 4: test it (don’t skip this)
1.
Log an ERROR that matches your filter.
2.
In CloudWatch Metrics → App/Alerts, make sure the metric ticks up.
3.
Watch the alarm flip to ALARM and check your email.
If nothing happens, go to your Log Group → Metric filters → Test pattern and paste a real log line. It’ll tell you if your pattern matches.
Prefer Terraform? here’s the whole thing
resource "aws_sns_topic" "app_alarms" {
name = "app-alarms"
}
resource "aws_sns_topic_subscription" "email" {
topic_arn = aws_sns_topic.app_alarms.arn
protocol
= "email"
endpoint
= "you@example.com"
}
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter" "errors" {
name
= "ErrorCount"
log_group_name = "/aws/lambda/my-fn"
pattern
= "\"ERROR\" -HealthCheck"
metric_transformation {
name
= "ErrorCount"
namespace
= "App/Alerts"
value
= "1"
default_value = "0"
}
}
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "error_alarm" {
alarm_name
= "LambdaErrorBurst"
namespace
= "App/Alerts"
metric_name
= "ErrorCount"
statistic
= "Sum"
period
= 60
evaluation_periods
= 3
threshold
= 1
comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
treat_missing_data
= "notBreaching"
alarm_actions
= [aws_sns_topic.app_alarms.arn]
ok_actions
= [aws_sns_topic.app_alarms.arn]
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Common gotchas (learned the hard way)
• Case matters. ERROR ≠ error. Match what you actually log.
• Per line matching. Filters look at one line at a time. If your stack trace spans lines, rely on a JSON level field instead.
• Right account/region. Metric filters must live with the log group.
• Don’t explode cardinality. Keep one metric per signal; don’t bake IDs into metric names.
• No alerts during quiet times. That treat missing data setting is your chill pill.
Variations you’ll probably want
• Slack/Teams: SNS → lambda → Slack (point & click).
• PagerDuty/Opsgenie: SNS → EventBridge → your incident tool.
• Smarter thresholds: Try Anomaly Detection alarms once you have baseline traffic.
• Composite alarms: “Only alert if errors spike and p50 latency is ugly.”
You don’t need a massive observability rebuild to get useful alerts. Start with one or two high signal patterns timeouts, 5xx, “payment failed” wire them to email, and iterate.
Tiny effort. Big safety net.
