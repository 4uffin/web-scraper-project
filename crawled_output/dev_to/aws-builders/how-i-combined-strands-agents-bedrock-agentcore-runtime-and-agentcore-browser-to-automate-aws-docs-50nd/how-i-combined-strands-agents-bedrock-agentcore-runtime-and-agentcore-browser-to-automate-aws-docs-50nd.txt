How I Combined Strands Agents, Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, and AgentCore Browser to Automate AWS Docs
#aws
#ai

#webdev
This summer, I barely had any time or energy to explore new technologies due to internal troubles at work and a family member being hospitalized. But by mid-September, I finally got some breathing room—so I decided to dive into Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, which had been generating buzz since July.
AgentCore is a suite of services designed for production-grade AI agent operations. Its core execution platform, AgentCore Runtime, quickly caught attention for being extremely easy to deploy.
Introducing Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: Securely deploy and operate AI agents at any scale (preview)
Since I had the chance, I also tried combining the AgentCore Browser, a managed browser for agents, to experiment with browser automation.
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool
What I Built
I created an agent with Strands Agents, deployed it on AgentCore Runtime, and connected it to the AgentCore Browser through Browser Use.
The goal: when asked something like
“How can I create a lifecycle policy for an S3 bucket?”,
the agent should navigate through official Amazon S3 documentation pages, extract key information, and generate an answer.
Prerequisites
Python 3.11+
AWS account with configured credentials
Region: us-west-2
Unfortunately, AgentCore is not yet available in ap-northeast-1
Access to the Claude Sonnet 4 base model
I used us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0
Code Overview
Here are the main points of the implementation.
The full source code is available on GitHub:
strands-agentcore-browseruse
Project Structure
Since there’s only one browser tool, I kept it simple:
src/
├── agents/
│
└── main_agent.py
# Main agent
├── runtime/
│
└── agentcore_app.py
# Integration with AgentCore Runtime
└── tools/
└── browser_tool.py
# Browser automation logic
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Implementing the Main Agent
The agent is built using Strands Agents.
It uses Claude Sonnet 4 as the model and the browse_url_tool for browser interaction.
def create_agent():
"""Create AWS Docs search agent"""
model = BedrockModel(
model_id='us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0',
params={
"max_tokens": 2048,
"temperature": 0.3,
"top_p": 0.8
},
region='us-west-2',
read_timeout=600,
)
agent = Agent(
name="aws_docs_agent",
model=model,
tools=[browse_url_tool],
system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT
)
return agent
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Connecting to AgentCore Runtime
Integrating with AgentCore Runtime is surprisingly simple.
Just use the @app.entrypoint decorator to expose an endpoint that accepts requests.
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()
@app.entrypoint
async def invoke(payload: Dict[str, Any], context) -> Dict[str, Any]:
try:
prompt = payload.get("prompt", "")
agent = create_agent()
result = agent(prompt)
return {
"result": str(result),
"status": "success"
}
except Exception as e:
return {
"error": f"Error: {str(e)}",
"status": "error"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Browser Automation Logic
This is the key part.
It launches AgentCore Browser and controls it from Browser Use via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
Start an AgentCore Browser session
Get the CDP WebSocket URL
Pass it to Browser Use
Provide proper authentication headers
async def execute_browser_task(instruction: str, starting_url: str = "https://docs.aws.amazon.com") -> str:
client = BrowserClient(region=region)
try:
client.start()
ws_url, headers = client.generate_ws_headers()
browser_profile = BrowserProfile(
headers=headers,
timeout=180000,
)
browser_session = BrowserSession(
cdp_url=ws_url,
browser_profile=browser_profile,
keep_alive=True
)
await browser_session.start()
browser_use_agent = BrowserUseAgent(
task=instruction,
llm=bedrock_chat,
browser_session=browser_session,
)
result = await browser_use_agent.run()
return result
finally:
if browser_session:
await browser_session.close()
client.stop()
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Important
Without pinning the version of browser-use, I ran into WebSocket 403 errors.
Be sure to specify it in your requirements.txt:
browser-use<0.3.3
Deploying to AgentCore Runtime
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Run the initial setup (this creates IAM roles, an Amazon Elastic Container Registry repo, etc.):
agentcore configure --entrypoint src/runtime/agentcore_app.py --region us-west-2
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You’ll need to manually attach this policy to the AmazonBedrockAgentCoreSDKRuntime-us-west-2-~ IAM role created by agentcore configure so it can use AgentCore Browser:
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "BrowserAccess",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"bedrock-agentcore:StartBrowserSession",
"bedrock-agentcore:StopBrowserSession",
"bedrock-agentcore:ConnectBrowserAutomationStream",
"bedrock-agentcore:ConnectBrowserLiveViewStream",
"bedrock-agentcore:ListBrowserSessions",
"bedrock-agentcore:GetBrowserSession",
"bedrock-agentcore:ListBrowsers",
"bedrock-agentcore:GetBrowser"
],
"Resource": "*"
}
]
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then deploy:
agentcore launch
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
For redeployments:
agentcore launch --auto-update-on-conflict
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Execution Result
After deployment, I tested it locally:
agentcore invoke '{"prompt": "How can I create a lifecycle policy for an S3 bucket?"}'
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
It took about 10 minutes (long), but the response was a fully detailed explanation of how to set up Amazon S3 lifecycle policies—complete with CLI, Console, SDK, and XML/JSON examples.
Response:
{"result": "Based on my research of the official AWS documentation, here's a comprehensive guide on how to create an S3 bucket lifecycle policy:\n\n## How to Create an S3 Bucket
Lifecycle Policy\n\nS3 lifecycle policies help you automatically manage your objects throughout their lifecycle, transitioning them between different storage classes and eventually
expiring them to optimize costs. Here are the different methods to create them:\n\n### **1. Using AWS CLI**\n\nThe most direct programmatic approach:\n\n**Basic
Command:**\n```
bash\naws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME --lifecycle-configuration file://lifecycle.json\n
```\n\n**Example JSON Configuration
File (lifecycle.json):**\n```
json\n{\n
\"Rules\": [\n
{\n
\"ID\": \"ExampleRule\",\n
\"Status\": \"Enabled\",\n
\"Filter\": {\n
\"Prefix\":
\"documents/\"\n
},\n
\"Transitions\": [\n
{\n
\"Days\": 30,\n
\"StorageClass\": \"STANDARD_IA\"\n
},\n
{\n
\"Days\":
90,\n
\"StorageClass\": \"GLACIER\"\n
}\n
],\n
\"Expiration\": {\n
\"Days\": 365\n
}\n
}\n
]\n}\n
```\n\n**Additional CLI Commands:**\n-
**View existing policy:** `aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket YOUR-BUCKET-NAME`\n- **Delete policy:** `aws s3api delete-bucket-lifecycle --bucket
YOUR-BUCKET-NAME`\n\n### **2. Using AWS Management Console**\n1. Navigate to the S3 console\n2. Select your bucket\n3. Go to the \"Management\" tab\n4. Click \"Create lifecycle
rule\"\n5. Configure your rule settings (filters, transitions, expiration)\n6. Review and create the rule\n\n### **3. Using REST API**\nThe API operations available:\n-
**PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration**\n- **GetBucketLifecycleConfiguration** \n- **DeleteBucketLifecycle**\n\n### **4. Using AWS SDKs**\nAvailable for Java, .NET, Ruby, Python, and
other languages with complete lifecycle management capabilities.\n\n## **Key Configuration Elements**\n\n### **Basic XML Structure:**\n```
xml\n<LifecycleConfiguration>\n
<Rule>\n
<ID>Unique-Rule-Name</ID>\n
<Filter>\n
<Prefix>folder/</Prefix>\n
</Filter>\n
<Status>Enabled</Status>\n
<Transition>\n
<Days>365</Days>\n
<StorageClass>GLACIER</StorageClass>\n
</Transition>\n
<Expiration>\n
<Days>3650</Days>\n
</Expiration>\n
</Rule>\n</LifecycleConfiguration>\n
```\n\n### **Available
Storage Classes (in transition order):**\n- **STANDARD** → **STANDARD_IA** → **GLACIER** → **DEEP_ARCHIVE**\n\n### **Filter Options:**\n- **Prefix**: Target objects with specific
key prefixes\n- **Tags**: Apply rules based on object tags\n- **Size**: Filter by object size (ObjectSizeGreaterThan/LessThan)\n- **Combinations**: Use `<And>` to combine multiple
filters\n\n## **Important Best Practices**\n\n1. **Configuration Replacement**: S3 replaces the entire lifecycle configuration when you add a new one. To update, retrieve existing
config first, modify it, then reapply.\n\n2. **Propagation Delay**: Expect a few minutes delay before new configurations take full effect.\n\n3. **Small Objects**: Objects smaller
than 128KB are prevented from transitioning by default (use size filters to override).\n\n4. **Testing**: Always verify your configuration after applying by checking rule counts
and testing with sample objects.\n\n5. **Cost Optimization**: Design rules to tier down storage classes over object lifetime to minimize costs.\n\n6. **Versioning Support**: Use
`NoncurrentVersionTransition` and `NoncurrentVersionExpiration` for versioning-enabled buckets.\n\n## **Common Use Cases**\n\n- **Log Archival**: Move application logs to cheaper
storage after 30 days, archive after 90 days\n- **Backup Management**: Transition backups to Glacier, expire after retention period\n- **Document Management**: Move old documents
through storage tiers based on access patterns\n- **Cleanup**: Remove incomplete multipart uploads and expired delete markers\n\nFor detailed examples, configuration samples, and
troubleshooting guidance, refer to the AWS S3 User Guide on lifecycle configuration.\n\n**Documentation Links:**\n- [S3 Lifecycle Configuration
Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-configuration-examples.html)\n- [Setting S3 Lifecycle
Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-set-lifecycle-configuration-intro.html)\n", "status": "success"}
