Introducing Kiro – An AI IDE That Thinks Like a Developer

👋 Hey there, tech enthusiasts!
I'm Sarvar, a Cloud Architect with a passion for transforming complex technological challenges into elegant solutions. With extensive experience spanning Cloud Operations (AWS & Azure), Data Operations, Analytics, DevOps, and Generative AI, I've had the privilege of architecting solutions for global enterprises that drive real business impact. Through this article series, I'm excited to share practical insights, best practices, and hands-on experiences from my journey in the tech world. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, I aim to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces that you can apply in your projects.
Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of cloud technology together! 🚀
In the fast-changing landscape of software development, artificial intelligence is no longer just a helper it’s becoming a teammate. Tools like GitHub Copilot have shown us what AI can do when it comes to code suggestions and autocomplete. But what if you had an intelligent agent that doesn’t just assist you line-by-line, but understands your goal, works across files, debugs issues, explains code, and executes tasks end-to-end almost like a junior engineer you can delegate work to?
That’s exactly what Kiro from AWS aims to do.
What Is Kiro?
Kiro is an experimental, agentic AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) introduced by AWS. The word agentic is key here. It means that Kiro is not just responding to prompts it is capable of autonomous, goal-driven actions. Instead of asking the AI to generate one snippet at a time, you describe what you want to build, and Kiro actively investigates your codebase, opens relevant files, and modifies them accordingly to fulfill your request.
Kiro is built with advanced AI models that are grounded in context and capable of multi-step reasoning. It connects to your local development environment, interprets your intentions, reads and modifies source code, and provides transparent feedback along the way.
How Is Kiro Different From GitHub Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is a powerful autocomplete tool. It works at the token level, predicting the next word or code line as you type. It helps improve developer productivity but is limited to working within a single file and immediate context.
Kiro takes a very different approach:
Goal-Oriented Development: You can ask Kiro to "add user authentication" or "create a REST API for the product module." It then opens all relevant files and makes the required changes.
Multi-File Context: Kiro analyzes and edits multiple files in your project, enabling end-to-end feature development.
Transparent Actions: Every change Kiro makes is shown in a task window where you can review, modify, or reject before applying.
Agentic Autonomy: It does not rely only on completion predictions it executes structured plans using internal reasoning loops and task execution.
In short, Copilot is like a fast autocomplete engine, while Kiro behaves like a junior developer who understands the goal and takes responsibility for solving the problem.
What Can You Do With Kiro?
Kiro comes with a wide range of capabilities that go beyond basic code generation. Here are some key features:
Write and Refactor Code: Generate new files, create APIs, fix bugs, and clean up code structure.
Explain Code and Architecture: Ask Kiro to explain any function, module, or entire architecture.
Debug with Context: Share error messages and logs Kiro will trace them, find the cause, and suggest fixes.
Modify UI and Backend Logic: It works across frontend and backend technologies.
Follow Up Tasks: You can ask follow-up questions or commands that build upon previous actions.
Use Open-Source Agents: Kiro is integrated with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework, so you can run it locally and plug in other AI agents or services.
Under the Hood – How Kiro Works
Kiro is built on a few core principles that make it powerful:
Agentic Reasoning Loop: It uses a structured loop of planning, reasoning, taking actions, and evaluating results. This loop enables it to handle multi-step tasks.
Context Awareness: It integrates tightly with your local environment using the MCP protocol and local LSP (Language Server Protocol) tools.
Security and Privacy: All actions are transparent, and code execution is done locally. Your data and code are not sent to the cloud unless you explicitly allow it.
FastAPI and Amazon Q Integration: Kiro can be extended with custom MCP servers like the Git Repo Research server and integrated with Amazon Q CLI to power real-time code analysis and problem resolution.
Why Should You Care?
As developers, we often spend a lot of time context switching jumping between files, reading documentation, debugging, or trying to understand legacy code. Kiro aims to reduce this friction. It allows you to focus on what you want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it line-by-line.
It’s especially useful in large projects, monorepos, or when onboarding into unfamiliar codebases. With Kiro, you get faster feedback, more confidence in changes, and a partner that evolves with your project.
Limitations and Current Status
As an AWS Community Builder, I’ve had the opportunity to be part of the Kiro journey since day one. Currently in preview, Kiro is an experimental project from AWS that brings agentic AI to the local development experience. It can be run locally by setting up the necessary MCP environment and linking it to your project directory. At this stage, Kiro supports popular languages like Python and JavaScript, with support for additional languages actively being developed.
Getting Started with Kiro
To get started with Kiro, follow the step-by-step guide below. This walk-through demonstrates the installation and setup process using the Windows operating system, but similar steps apply for macOS and Linux.
Step 1: Visit the Official Kiro Website
Go to the official Kiro website.
Step 2: Download the Installer
Click on the Download button based on the operating system you are using. In this example, we are using Windows, so we download the Windows executable (.exe) file.
Once downloaded, run the installer, click through the setup steps, and complete the installation.
Step 3: Sign Up for Kiro
After the installation is complete, Kiro will prompt you to sign up. You can choose from multiple sign-in options. In this case, we are using AWS Builder ID.
Step 4: Benefit of Using AWS Builder ID
Signing in with AWS Builder ID unlocks direct integration with Amazon Q within Kiro. If you have access to the Amazon Q Pro version, it can significantly enhance your experience by offering deeper code analysis, explanations, and agentic assistance during development.
Step 5: Import Existing VS Code Configuration (Optional)
Next, Kiro gives you the option to import your existing VS Code settings and configurations. This can include themes, extensions, and preferences. For this guide, we are skipping this step and proceeding with the default settings.
Step 6: Complete Setup
Once you finish the onboarding steps, Kiro is ready to use. You have now successfully installed and configured the Kiro IDE.
Documentation and Resources
You can explore more features, updates, and usage examples from the official kIRO.
Note: We will explore Kiro in a more detailed manner in our upcoming article series, where we’ll dive into its advanced features, real-world use cases, integration with Amazon Q, and how it fits into modern development workflows. Stay tuned for the next articles.
Conclusion: Kiro represents a significant shift in how we interact with code. Instead of being a passive tool that waits for instructions, it acts as an intelligent partner that understands, acts, and reasons. For developers, especially those working in complex environments or looking to accelerate delivery, Kiro can save time, reduce mental load, and improve code quality. It's not just an AI assistant it's a step toward the future of autonomous software engineering.

Kiro Sonet 4 model, showing "The service is experiencing high load. Please try again later." from past 24 hour, not sure if is really an issue or generic msg, at the intital stage of launch, this type of inconsistency may damage the product reputation. I got stuck in middle of a development and not help so far. Any idea?

Yes, it’s a known issue Kiro Sonet 4 is under high demand during its preview phase. The error is real, not just generic. But i will check with AWS team and let you now soon.

En mi caso fue rápido, en 7 días me llegó la invitación con el código de acceso. Puede variar, pero normalmente no tarda mucho.
