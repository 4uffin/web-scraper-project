Kiro vs Cursor: How Amazon‚Äôs AI IDE Is Redefining Developer Productivity
#aws

üëã Hey there, tech enthusiasts!
I'm Sarvar, a Cloud Architect with a passion for transforming complex technological challenges into elegant solutions. With extensive experience spanning Cloud Operations (AWS & Azure), Data Operations, Analytics, DevOps, and Generative AI, I've had the privilege of architecting solutions for global enterprises that drive real business impact. Through this article series, I'm excited to share practical insights, best practices, and hands-on experiences from my journey in the tech world. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting out, I aim to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces that you can apply in your projects.
Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of cloud technology together! üöÄ
In 2024, the AI developer tool ecosystem saw a massive surge in innovation
with Cursor redefining what an IDE could be, and now, Amazon stepping in with Kiro, a powerful new agentic development environment deeply integrated with Claude models. While both tools aim to make developers more productive, their core design philosophies, integrations, and developer workflows show significant differences.
Let‚Äôs break down both tools in detail, explore their features, and why Kiro might become the new standard for software development.
What is Cursor?
Cursor is an AI-native IDE forked from VS Code, designed for developers who want tight integration with AI copilots. It introduced real-time, context-aware code help, full-project understanding, and chat-based support for debugging, generation, and refactoring.
Key Features of Cursor
Integrated assistant supporting GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini
Supports inline code edits, bug fixes, and contextual codebase search
Extensible via plugins and themes from the VS Code ecosystem
Works well for small to medium-sized projects and personal workflows
Offers flexibility to switch between LLMs for different scenarios
Cursor has become popular among solo developers and indie teams for its flexibility and quick setup.
What is Amazon Kiro?
Amazon Kiro is an AI-native IDE also based on VS Code (Code OSS), developed by AWS and powered by Claude Sonnet 4.0 (with 3.7 as fallback). It‚Äôs designed for seamless planning, execution, and orchestration of software development tasks combining an intuitive interface with deep contextual understanding and built-in agentic workflows.
Key Capabilities of Kiro
Powered by Claude Sonnet 4.0 and Claude 3.7, with more models coming soon
Doesn‚Äôt require Amazon Q Developer or Q Pro free plan available with social login
Offers Specs for structured planning and requirement-driven workflows
Supports Hooks for background automations on code events
Designed to guide development with user stories, design docs, tasks, and tests
Smooth, VS Code-compatible experience with built-in support for MCP and Git
Ideal for both enterprise environments and solo developers
Whether you're building a full-stack app or fixing a long-standing bug, Kiro takes the guesswork out of prompting by ‚Äúthinking before coding‚Äù a standout quality noted by many early adopters.
Why Kiro Might Revolutionize Software Development
While Cursor shows the path toward AI-first development, Kiro scales that vision to the enterprise level and beyond. It doesn‚Äôt just write code; it builds systems from specs to deployment making it not just an IDE, but a software engineering co-pilot.
Planning-First Development: Kiro‚Äôs Game-Changer
Kiro shines not just in code generation, but in how it plans before coding. It analyzes your codebase, scopes the problem, drafts a solution plan, and only then writes the code much like Claude Code‚Äôs ‚Äúplan mode,‚Äù but fully built-in.
This intent-driven development makes complex tasks feel manageable and structured, giving developers clarity and control without the fatigue of micromanaging prompts.
Specs: The Engineering Workflow Developers Asked For
Kiro‚Äôs Spec mode is one of its most praised innovations. It lets developers start by describing what needs to be built either manually or by letting Kiro generate specs using the EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).
From there, Kiro generates:
User stories
Design documents
Data flow diagrams
Database schemas and API stubs
A task and subtask list with test and accessibility requirements
Each task becomes an actionable thread you simply trigger and Kiro gets to work.
Kiro‚Äôs Built-in Spec-Driven Development Workflow
One of the most compelling innovations of Kiro is its automatic spec-driven development process. Without needing a specific prompt, Kiro generates a spec.md that includes:
A Requirements Document with structured user stories
A Design Document with valid Mermaid.js architecture diagrams
A Task List, linking back to those documents
This end-to-end workflow scaffolds best practices from the start, reducing prompt engineering and enabling developers to shift from vibe-coded prototypes to production-grade apps systematically.
"Kiro basically applies SWE best practices automatically. It‚Äôs like Claude Code but structured and proactive."
Kiro Hooks: Invisible Developer Automation
With Kiro Hooks, you can automatically trigger background tasks based on events like saving or editing files. Hooks can:
Scan for credentials
Update READMEs
Enforce team-wide standards
This provides a ‚Äúsenior developer on autopilot‚Äù feel, catching what you‚Äôd normally forget and reducing friction across the workflow.
Developer Experience: Where Kiro Feels Different
Built-in Planning: No need to ask ‚ÄúCan you plan this?‚Äù Kiro already does.
Project Context Memory: Carries memory across sessions, enhancing continuity.
Spec & Task Flow: Converts complex ideas into execution-ready task graphs.
Minimal Prompting Overhead: Less time instructing, more time building.
UI Polish: Lightweight, intuitive, and clean across Linux, Mac, and Windows.
Cursor vs Kiro ‚Äì Real-World Observations
Kiro only uses Claude (no GPT); Cursor supports GPT-4 & Claude
Kiro generates structured specs and tasks out of the box; Cursor requires setup
Kiro has long-context retention across sessions; Cursor sometimes forgets quickly
Cursor‚Äôs workflow is flexible, but Kiro enforces discipline in planning
Cursor has GPT integration, giving more raw flexibility, but Kiro offers structure
Kiro is free (currently), but long-term pricing is unknown
Note: Kiro runs on Claude Sonnet 4.0 (not Amazon Q), and you don‚Äôt need Q Pro to use it. Social logins are supported, and most features work right out of the box.
Real-World Feedback: Why Developers Love Kiro
"Kiro‚Äôs standout feature is what it does before it writes code the built-in planning and analysis is a game-changer."
"Specs are incredibly powerful. It feels like true engineering, not tool-wrangling."
"I love how Kiro just thinks. In Cursor, I had to force it to plan. Here it‚Äôs automatic."
"This is worlds better than the competing free choice, Gemini CLI."
"I‚Äôve been using it all day. Only switched back to Cursor when I needed a different model."
Kiro‚Äôs approach to planning-first engineering, along with smooth solo workflow support, makes it ideal for everything from fixing that one tough bug to orchestrating full product builds.
Early Praise from Builders
I‚Äôve been exploring Kiro since day one as part of the AWS Community Builder program, and it's clear that users across the community are genuinely impressed by Kiro‚Äôs thoughtful approach to automation and planning-first development:
Tests follow Go-style table-driven test design
Planning and task threads reduce project ambiguity
The UI is cleaner and faster than most IDE wrappers, including Cursor
Note on Current Limitations
Kiro is still in early access, and demand is surging. Some users have faced occasional slowdowns or queue-based usage limits. This is likely due to high load on Claude 4, the foundational model powering Kiro. As of today, while writing this article, Amazon has officially shared the following message on kiro.dev:
"Thank you for your amazing response to Kiro!
Kiro is seeing unprecedented demand. Join our waitlist and we'll notify you as soon as access is available."
Conclusion: Cursor Is Flexible, Kiro Is the Future Cursor offers strong flexibility and multi-model support, making it a solid AI IDE for everyday devs. But Kiro is building something larger a tightly integrated, planning-aware, context-rich development environment that goes beyond copilots to become a true engineering assistant. With its Specs, Hooks, Claude-powered agents, and persistent project memory, Kiro isn‚Äôt just helping you write better code it‚Äôs redefining how code gets built.
If you‚Äôre a Cursor user, exploring Kiro early could future-proof your workflows especially if you value structure, automation, and planning as much as productivity.

After a week testing their preview, I am putting this ghost back in the containment unit. While I see the vision, here are the friction points I encountered:
1) Rigid workflow kills momentum Kiro enforces a waterfall approach: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Task List ‚Üí Coding. While this structure works for building features from scratch, it becomes a bottleneck during iteration.
The real issue? Requirements and design artifacts don't auto-update when you make changes through prompting. Your implementation and specs drift apart unless you manually update each step - a time sink that breaks the iterative flow essential to productive coding sessions.
2) Poor codebase comprehension Kiro struggled to analyze my existing code and conventions. It missed reusable components that should have been leveraged with minor tweaks. Its rigid task-list execution leaves no room for the coding agent to adapt once implementation begins.
In contrast, Claude Code dynamically adjusts its approach as it discovers new implementation details during execution.
I'm sticking with Claude Code's planning mode for now, and it's unlimited Max plan. Until Kiro can keep specs synchronized with ongoing changes and actual code, it adds overhead rather than enhancing productivity.

Great summary, really interesting to see how this works!
Unfortunately, I‚Äôm still stuck on the waitlist so haven‚Äôt been able to try Kiro myself yet. In my own custom AI agent setup, I‚Äôve found the agent control loop, specs-driven development, and especially a clear Task List to be essential to keeping the agent on track and autonomous.
If you‚Äôre curious, I wrote a post about my own findings how I got a single agent to ship production-ready code with no mid-task tweaks. Here‚Äôs Part 1 of the series.
Would love to hear your thoughts if you get a chance to check it out!

Thanks for sharing your experience that sounds fascinating! I totally agree that the agent control loop and task list clarity are key for any kind of autonomous progress. I‚Äôd love to dive into your Part 1 and see how you approached specs-driven development and kept your agent on track end-to-end. It‚Äôs always inspiring to see real-world applications outside the mainstream tools like Kiro. Once I check it out, I‚Äôll definitely share my thoughts. Appreciate you dropping this here!
