✔️ Conclusion
🔥 The $10K Problem
Last week, during our monthly billing review, our Leadership asked me a simple question during our weekly review: "Why did our AWS bill jump 30% in the development accounts?"
What should have been a 5-minute answer turned into a 3-hour investigation. I had to:
Log into 12 different AWS accounts (we organize by team and environment)
Export CSV files from Cost Explorer for each account
Manually merge data in Excel to find patterns
Cross-reference with our deployment logs to find the culprit
By the time I found the answer (someone left a large RDS instance running in our sandbox), the meeting was over and I'd missed two other important calls.
This wasn't a one-time thing. Every week brought similar fire drills:
"Are we going to exceed our Q4 budget?"
"Which team is driving up our CloudWatch costs?"
"Can we get cost forecasts for the new microservices architecture?"
Each question meant hours of manual work, switching between accounts, and building custom reports. There had to be a better way.
🚀 The Game-Changer: AWS Billing MCP
The AWS Billing & Cost Management MCP Server is a true game-changer for anyone managing complex AWS environments. Think of it as a personal cost analyst you can chat with.
Earlier, I used to spend hours every month downloading CSV files, cross-checking usage, and only at the beginning of the month would I realize that costs had spiked. From there, it was a long, time-consuming process reviewing budget alerts, checking with teams, and digging through resources to understand what went wrong.
Now, with Amazon Q CLI connected to the Billing MCP Server, the process is completely transformed. Whenever a budget alert is triggered, I simply ask: “Hey Q, why did I get this alert?” and instantly, I get detailed insights in real time.
Instead of clicking through multiple AWS consoles, I can ask plain-English questions from the CLI and receive immediate answers. It has become part of my daily workflow to check billing directly from the command line.
Example queries I use:
q "Show me which accounts had cost spikes this week"
q "Compare EC2 spending across all production accounts"
q "Are we on track to hit our monthly budget?"
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This shift has taken cost analysis from a painful manual process to a fast, conversational experience.
💲 Pricing MCP vs 💵 Billing MCP: What's the Difference?
I use both servers for different purposes:
AWS Pricing MCP
AWS Billing MCP
"What will it cost?"
"What did it cost?"
Planning new resources
Analyzing actual usage
"Price of c5.2xlarge in us-west-2?"
"How much did we spend on EC2 last month?"
Before deployment
After deployment
They work together perfectly. I use Pricing MCP when designing architectures and Billing MCP for ongoing cost management.
For a detailed walkthrough of AWS Pricing MCP, you can explore my article here: Real-Time AWS Cost Estimation Using the Pricing MCP Server and Amazon Q CLI.
⚙️ How It Works?
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server runs locally and connects to AWS's billing APIs. When I ask a question through Amazon Q CLI, it:
Translates my question into the right AWS API calls
Fetches data from Cost Explorer, Budgets, and other services
Analyzes the results across all my accounts
Returns clear answers with actionable insights
No more manual exports or Excel gymnastics.

This section covers how to set up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows Amazon Q to get AWS pricing access.
Step 1: Install Python 3.10
To run the MCP server locally, Amazon Q requires Python 3.10. Here's a breakdown of each command to install it properly on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
1. Update the package list
sudo apt update -y
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What it does:
Fetches the latest list of available packages and versions from the Ubuntu repositories. Always a good first step before installing anything new.
2. Install software-properties-common
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What it does:
Installs a package that allows you to manage additional repositories (like PPAs). Required to add the Deadsnakes PPA for Python 3.10.
3. Add the Deadsnakes PPA
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What it does:
Adds the Deadsnakes Personal Package Archive (PPA) to your system. This PPA maintains up-to-date versions of Python not available in the default Ubuntu repos.
4. Install Python 3.10 and related tools
sudo apt install -y python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
What it does:
python3.10: Installs the Python 3.10 interpreter
python3.10-venv: Enables creating virtual environments with python3.10 -m venv
python3.10-dev: Provides headers and development tools needed to build Python packages with native extensions
Once these steps are complete, Python 3.10 will be available on your EC2 instance.
You can verify the version using:
python3.10 --version
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate the MCP server:
python3.10 -m venv ~/aws-mcp-env
source ~/aws-mcp-env/bin/activate
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 3: Install MCP Server and Dependencies
Use pip to install the required libraries:
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install uv uvenv trio
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Step 4: Configure Amazon Q to Use the MCP Server

mkdir -p ~/.aws/amazonq
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then create the config file at ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json:
{
"mcpServers": {
"awslabs.billing-cost-management-mcp-server": {
"command": "uvx",
"args": [
"awslabs.billing-cost-management-mcp-server@latest"
],
"env": {
"AWS_PROFILE": "default",
"AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
},
"disabled": false
}
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
You can create the file using nano or vim:
nano ~/aws/amazonq/mcp.json
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Paste the above configuration and save the file.
Note: If you face any issue in MCP configuration code please follow this link.
Important: If your MCP is not loading or shows warnings like the example below, please note that these warnings come from AWS service limitations and account configurations, not from issues in the MCP server code itself.
Optional: Use Amazon Q CLI to Set Up MCP
Alternatively, Amazon Q CLI itself can help you set up the MCP server if you provide the right prompts. You can ask:
Set up a local MCP server for AWS Pricing MCP
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This approach may simplify the process by handling package installation and configuration automatically.
🚀 Real-World Examples: Testing & Using AWS Billing MCP
Once your AWS Billing MCP Server is configured, here are practical examples to test your setup and see immediate value.

To fix inconsistent tagging you can first use getDimensionValues to see which tags actually exist, and then group by the tag dimension. This makes it easier to spot high cost resources that arent tagged and need attention. For cross account anomalies the costanomaly tool automatically pulls data across the entire organization. You can filter by i think link-account and then run a month over month costcomparison to quickly find out which accounts are driving unusual spend. Let me know if you need additional information.
