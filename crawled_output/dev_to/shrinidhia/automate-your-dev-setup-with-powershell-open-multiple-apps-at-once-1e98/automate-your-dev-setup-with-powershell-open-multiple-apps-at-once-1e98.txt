Automate Your Dev Setup with PowerShell: Open Multiple Apps at Once
#productivity
#devtools
#automation
#codingtips
Every morning when I log into my system, I used to spend a few minutes manually opening the apps I need VS Code, Postman, Docker Desktop, maybe even Slack.
Over time, that got annoying. So I automated it with a small PowerShell script.
Now, with just a script in place, all my dev tools launch automatically as soon as I log in.
Here‚Äôs how you can do it too.
The PowerShell Script
# List of applications you want to launch automatically
$appPaths = @(
"C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe",
"C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Postman\Postman.exe",
"C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"
)
foreach ($app in $appPaths) {
if (Test-Path $app) {
Write-Host "üöÄ Launching: $app"
Start-Process -FilePath $app
Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
# Small delay between launches (optional)
} else {
Write-Warning "‚ö†Ô∏è Not found: $app"
}
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
How It Works
Create a list of app paths you want to start ($appPaths).
Loop through each one and launch it using Start-Process.
Add a delay (Start-Sleep) so apps don‚Äôt clash while loading.
That‚Äôs it! Super simple.
Automating at Login
To make this run every time you log in:
Save the script as AutoStartApps.ps1.
Press Win + R, type shell:startup and hit Enter.
This opens your Startup folder.
Add a shortcut here that runs your PowerShell script.
Now your dev setup is ready the moment you log in üéâ
Why This Is Awesome
Saves time every morning.
Ensures you don‚Äôt forget to start essential tools.
You can extend it: open projects, run servers, start databases, etc.
Final Thoughts
Automation doesn‚Äôt always mean complex scripts or heavy tooling.
Sometimes, it‚Äôs just a tiny PowerShell file that saves you minutes every single day.
Give it a try you‚Äôll thank yourself tomorrow morning ‚òïüíª
