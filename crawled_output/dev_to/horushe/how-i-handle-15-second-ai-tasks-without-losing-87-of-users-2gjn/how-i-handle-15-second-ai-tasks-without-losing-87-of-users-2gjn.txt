How I Handle 15-Second AI Tasks Without Losing 87% of Users
#webdev

Last week, I watched our analytics dashboard in horror. 87% of users were abandoning our AI jersey designer during the generation process. The culprit? A spinning loader that lasted 15-20 seconds with zero feedback.
Sound familiar? If you're building AI features, you've probably faced this exact problem. Here's how I transformed those painful wait times into a smooth, engaging experience that actually keeps users around.
The $10,000 Problem
Our AI jersey generator was bleeding users and money. Every abandoned generation meant:
Wasted AI compute costs ($0.04 per failed attempt)
Lost conversion opportunity ($12 average order value)
Negative brand perception (users thought the app was broken)
After losing nearly $10,000 in potential revenue in just one month, I knew we needed a radical rethink.
The Magic: Async Processing + Smart Polling
Instead of making users wait, I split the process into three phases:
// 1. Instant submission - returns in 200ms
async function submitDesign(request: Request) {
const validation = validateInput(request.body);
if (!validation.success) return { error: validation.error };
// Create async task and return immediately
const predictionId = await createPrediction({
prompt: request.body.prompt,
webhookUrl: `${API_URL}/webhooks/ai-complete`
});
// Store initial status
await kvStore.put(`prediction:${predictionId}`, {
status: 'starting',
createdAt: Date.now()
});
return {
predictionId,
message: 'Your design is being created!'
};
}

Exit fullscreen mode
The Frontend Magic
Here's where it gets interesting. Instead of a boring spinner, users see real progress:
function JerseyGenerator() {
const [status, setStatus] = useState('idle');
const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
async function pollStatus(predictionId: string) {
const delays = [1000, 2000, 5000, 10000]; // Progressive delays
let attempt = 0;
while (attempt < 60) {
const result = await fetch(`/api/status/${predictionId}`);
const data = await result.json();
if (data.status === 'processing') {
setProgress(Math.min(attempt * 10, 90)); // Visual progress
setStatus('AI is crafting your unique design...');
} else if (data.status === 'succeeded') {
setProgress(100);
displayResult(data.imageUrl);
return;
}
const delay = delays[Math.min(attempt, delays.length - 1)];
await sleep(delay);
attempt++;
}
}
return (
<div>
{status !== 'idle' && (
<ProgressBar value={progress} message={status} />
)}
</div>
);
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
The Webhook Secret Sauce
When the AI completes, a webhook instantly updates the status:
async function handleWebhook(request: Request) {
const event = await request.json();
// Verify webhook signature (crucial for security!)
if (!verifySignature(request)) {
return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
}
if (event.status === 'succeeded') {
// Download and store the result
const imageUrl = await storeImage(event.output[0]);
// Update status for frontend polling
await kvStore.put(`prediction:${event.id}`, {
status: 'succeeded',
imageUrl,
completedAt: Date.now()
});
}
return new Response('OK');
}

Real Production Results
After implementing this architecture at AI Jersey Design:
📊 User Engagement:
Abandonment rate: 87% → 12%
Average session duration: +340%
Conversion rate: 2.3% → 8.7%
⚡ Performance:
Initial response: 200ms (was 15+ seconds)
P95 completion time: 8 seconds
Successful generations: 99.2%
💰 Business Impact:
Revenue increase: +278%
Support tickets: -65%
AI cost per conversion: -40%
The Gotchas Nobody Talks About
Webhook Retries: AI services retry failed webhooks. Without idempotency, you'll process duplicates.
Status Expiration: Set TTLs on your KV storage. I learned this after accumulating 100GB of orphaned predictions.
Progressive Delays: Don't poll every second! Use exponential backoff to save bandwidth.
Error Recovery: When webhooks fail, have a backup polling mechanism to check AI service directly.
Quick Implementation Checklist
If you're implementing this pattern, here's your checklist:
[ ] Non-blocking API endpoint that returns immediately
[ ] KV storage for status with automatic TTL
[ ] Webhook endpoint with signature verification
[ ] Frontend polling with progressive delays
[ ] Progress indicators beyond just spinners
[ ] Error handling for each failure mode
[ ] Monitoring for webhook delivery rates
The Architecture That Scales
This pattern has handled:
Peak load: 500+ concurrent generations
Daily volume: 10,000+ images
Global users: <50ms status checks worldwide
Zero downtime: During 3 months of production
Your Turn

Awesome write-up, @horushe! Really appreciated the transparency in showing how you turned such a high abandonment rate into real metrics that mattered. 🙌
Some thoughts/questions that came up:
I like the progressive polling + status updates instead of the “wait spinner” — it’s such a better UX. Did you try adjusting the delays dynamically based on server load or user’s network speed? Might help for users on slow connections.
The webhook + status-store approach seems solid. One challenge I’ve run into is data consistency when retries happen or when the prediction service is flaky. How did you manage idempotency and duplicate request handling in practice?
Curious if you considered showing a preview or low-res version early, then replacing it when the full design is ready? Might reduce perceived wait even more.
Thanks for sharing your checklist too — I’ll definitely try to adopt some of these patterns in my own AI features. Looking forward to your next post on cost-reduction!
