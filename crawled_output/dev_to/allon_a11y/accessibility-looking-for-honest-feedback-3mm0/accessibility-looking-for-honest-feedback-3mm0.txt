Accessibility: Looking for Honest Feedback

Hi everyone,
Over the past weeks I’ve been auditing and fixing accessibility issues on my own website. I’d estimate that I’ve resolved around 90% of the issues I initially identified, but of course, testing your own site always comes with a blind spot. That’s why I’d love to hear from this community.
What I’ve done so far:
Fixed color contrast issues based on WCAG 2.2 guidelines
Improved keyboard navigation and focus states
Adjusted heading structure for clearer hierarchy
Ensured reflow and zoom work properly on small screens
Tested with VoiceOver for basic screen reader compatibility
I know many of you have sharp eyes for accessibility details that can be easy to miss. I’d really value your feedback:
Do you notice any barriers still present?
Are there areas where the user experience could be further improved for assistive technology users?
Anything I might have overlooked entirely?
If you’re open to taking a look, I’d greatly appreciate any feedback on my accessibility audit process. All criticism is welcome, the more critical and detailed, the better. I see this as a chance to learn and to keep raising the standard of accessibility in practice.
Thanks in advance for your time.
