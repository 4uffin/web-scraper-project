AI Chart Animator

This is a submission for the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge
What I Built
I built the AI Chart Animator, a web application that breathes life into static data visualizations. The app solves a common problem for presenters, marketers, and data analysts: static charts are informative but often visually unengaging. Creating animated versions traditionally requires specialized software and significant manual effort.
AI Chart Animator streamlines this entire process. A user can upload an image of a standard bar or line chart, and through a sophisticated multimodal AI pipeline, the application automatically generates a stunning, futuristic animation of that chart. The result is a dynamic video that makes data more impactful and memorable.
The core workflow is a three-step process powered by AI:
Stylize: A Google Gemini model transforms the original chart into a high-tech, futuristic version, which serves as the animation's end frame.
Deconstruct: The same model then intelligently removes the data elements (the bars or lines) from the futuristic chart to create a clean, empty frame, which serves as the animation's start frame.
Animate: A third-party video generation model (Hailuo AI) is used to create a smooth animation that transitions between the start and end frames, showing the data appearing dynamically.
Demo
I couldn't deploy this app to cloud run, because my credits were over for Minimax API, and I didn't had credit card for cloud run deployment. But, here is the aistudio app link, through which you can see the app and its code: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/18mGw-J40Vjon-elGWBWBYyla-J5fMOIY. Anyone with this public link can access
the app.
You can see the AI Chart Animator in action in this full walkthrough video:
Below is a visual representation of the app's three-step generation process:

How I Used Google AI Studio
I leveraged Google AI Studio's powerful multimodal capabilities as the core engine for the image processing pipeline. The entire image transformation process is powered by the gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model. My implementation uses a chained, multi-step approach where the output of one multimodal prompt becomes the input for the next.
Step 1: Initial Transformation (Image + Text -> Image)
I send the user's uploaded chart image along with a detailed text prompt to Gemini. The prompt instructs the model to reimagine the chart with a futuristic aesthetic while critically preserving the original data.
Prompt for a Bar Chart:
"Transform this bar chart into a 3D futuristic masterpiece. Give it a sleek, dark theme with vibrant neon highlights and a high-tech feel. The bars should have a sense of depth and perspective. Keep the overall structure, data, and labels intact but render them in a matching 3D style."
Step 2: Content Removal (Image + Text -> Image)
The newly generated futuristic chart from Step 1 is then sent back to the Gemini model. This time, it's accompanied by a different text prompt that acts as a precise surgical instruction to deconstruct the image.
Prompt to remove bars from the futuristic chart:
"From this 3D futuristic bar chart image, perfectly remove only the colored bars. It is crucial to leave the 3D axes, axis labels, grid lines, title, and background completely intact, preserving their perspective and style. The output should be the empty 3D chart frame."
This two-step process, driven entirely by Gemini's ability to understand and manipulate image content based on text commands, is what creates the necessary start and end frames for the final animation.
Step 3: Animation Video Generation (Start Image + End Image -> Video)
I use the 2 images generated in the previous steps to generate a cool animation video using Minimax's Hailuo model. This is the step for which I need Minimax's API key, don't worry the API key is used only for 1 animation video generation and is not stored. The image generated from Step 2 is used as the starting frame, and the image generated from Step 1 is used as the ending frame.
Multimodal Features
The core of this project is its sophisticated use of Image + Text -> Image Generation to deconstruct and rebuild a data visualization for animation. This goes far beyond simple image generation and leverages Gemini's deep contextual understanding.
Context-Aware Stylization: The first multimodal feature is the ability to apply a complex artistic style (futuristic, neon) to a structured image (a chart) without corrupting the underlying information. The model successfully understands the prompt's intent to "keep the data intact," demonstrating a crucial comprehension of both the visual input and the text constraints. This enhances the user experience by transforming a mundane chart into something visually exciting and professional.
Intelligent Object Removal: The second, more advanced multimodal feature is the ability to selectively remove specific elements from an image based on a natural language command. Asking the model to "perfectly remove only the colored bars" or "remove the lines from the line graphs" requires it to identify what a "bar" or "line" is within the context of the chart, isolate it from the background and axes, and intelligently fill in the space behind it. This is a powerful capability that automates what would otherwise be a tedious manual task in an image editor, making the entire animation workflow feasible and fast for the end-user.

Wow this is awesome, I just created a cool animation for my bar chart which I used in my presentation.
