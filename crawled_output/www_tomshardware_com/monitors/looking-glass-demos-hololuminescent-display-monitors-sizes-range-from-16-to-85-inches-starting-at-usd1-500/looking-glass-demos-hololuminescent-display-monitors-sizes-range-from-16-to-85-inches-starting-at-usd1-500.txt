These displays don't need eye tracking, special glasses, and are good for group viewing.

Looking Glass has taken the wraps off its new monitors with Hololuminescent Display (HLD) technology. The firm has been in the holographic displays market for a decade, but it believes its new HLD monitors, which are just 1-inch thick and deliver up to a 4K resolution, can deliver “magical holograms that can be deployed anywhere.” HLD will allow the firm’s immersive light field to be rolled out anywhere standard video screens are used today.

According to Looking Glass, HLDs “create an immersive three-dimensional stage for all types of content -— without the complexity of traditional 3D pipelines.” They do not need eye tracking technology or special viewing lenses, so they are suitable for viewing by groups. This is a significant quality that could potentially help adoption in traditional digital signage devices.For content creators, HLDs are said to work with standard 2D video workflows mixing real-world footage, animation, interactive applications, and AI generation. A demonstration workflow with a green screen, character, and Adobe Premiere Pro is outlined on the HLD How It Works page.

Give me a 48", 4K, Mini-LED, glasses-less 3D monitor with 120hz refresh and can switch from a curved to flat panel. Is that too much to ask? Why has no one made this happen yet? :unsure:;)

It's interesting. I would want to see it in person and it's not clear how useful it is.
A lot of research has been done on turning 2d content, or video/images from multiple angles into 3d. If you have no content, transforming what's available might work.

Why nobody offering just usual but more decent quality AR glasses ? Sony 4k microdisplays exist already. The 3D effect is there automatically if you want it

What technology are they using to make this work?

Not another 3D BS again.

Hooda Thunkett said:What technology are they using to make this work?As far as I can tell, it is 2 layers. A backlit LCD or similar display is where a 2d video is displayed (probably a video format that specifies transparency) and this is all in front of a very simple hologram box. The deep box makes the 2d video appear 3d, but the content in the center of the display is not true 3d. This "3d display" is more of an optical illusion, as the only real 3d part is the box. Cool effect though, but stick with normal 3d monitors if you want real 3d. This is more of a display/advertising product.

There is no holography involved, and these are not light-field displays.
These are autostereo displays, but very slightly tilted (so most of the displayed images are arranged side-to-side to account for head movement, but there are a handful up/down so the trick is not too obvious.
Their main improvement over other autostereo displays is the use of a custom subpixel filter that repeats at an angle rather than the usual vertical Bayer patter, so that colour artefacts are reduced for their tilted lens layout.

Some of the best gaming I ever had was in true stereo 3D. Shame it never caught on... if the demand was there we would have reached mainstream glasses-less 3D by now.

I'm unclear about how this model differs from their prior displays, although it sure sounds like it does in some substantial ways. Do you have any insights into that? I was hoping you might! The info provided by the manufacturer is about as clear as mud, to me.

Apple is currently the state of the art, far ahead of anyone else, and yet their solution is so bulky and expensive that they've had to cut their sales forecasts way back from when it launched.
