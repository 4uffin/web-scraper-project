A new report from top Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo claims that the company will finally introduce touchscreen technology to its Mac lineup, beginning with an OLED MacBook Pro set to enter mass production in late 2026.Kuo made the revelation on X early on Wednesday morning. "MacBook models will feature a touch panel for the first time, further blurring the line with the iPad," he noted. "This shift appears to reflect Apple’s long-term observation of iPad user behavior, indicating that in certain scenarios, touch controls can enhance both productivity and the overall user experience."According to Kuo, a new OLED MacBook Pro is expected to enter mass production "by late 2026." The information — which, of course, is unofficial — could indicate a launch in Q4 2026 or possibly early 2027. The former seems likely, given that Apple generally launches new Mac models in the fall and has been previously tipped to be exploring an annual release cycle for Macs more in line with its iPhone launch schedule.

Kuo further notes that Apple is planning a more affordable MacBook powered by an A-series iPhone processor. He says this is slated for mass production in 4Q25, which could indicate a launch very soon. He notes a second-generation version of this MacBook could come in 2027 and that Apple is considering touch screen support for that model.Apple's current MacBook Pro family was unveiled in October 2024 and sports the M4 family of Apple silicon chips. While its Liquid Retina XDR display offers 120Hz refresh rates, OLED technology remains a key tech that is set to grace the Apple MacBook lineup. Further previous leaks from the supply chain have hinted at MacBook Pro models with OLED displays coming in 2026, lining up nicely with Kuo's latest prediction.Apple has famously eschewed touchscreen tech on its laptops, an aversion that dates back to Steve Jobs' tenure as CEO. Jobs famously blasted the concept, telling an audience in 2010 that "touch surfaces don't want to be vertical," citing user fatigue and terrible ergonomics.If Kuo is right about the touch screen MacBook in 2026 (his track record is extremely solid), then that would signal a true change in Mac design philosophy from Apple, which many users have been clamoring for over generations of MacBook launches.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Apple's M5 MacBook series is next in the lineup. Previously, industry sources had tipped them for a release at the end of this year; however, latterly Kuo has pointed to a 2026 launch. It's possible Kuo's OLED touch screen predictions relate to this lineup, but it seems more likely the change will be reserved for the next generation M6 processors.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

I'm all for giving ppl what they want, but I've never understood the appeal of putting greasy fingerprints all over your main display. I'm typing this from a keyboard with an attached touchscreen. In the past year I've used the touch feature one single time to sign a digital document.

Can't believe they haven't invented a touchscreen Macbook yet, what year is this?

There is some logic to this change at Apple. Apple for years has not wanted to cannibalize its iPad lineup. It also has wanted to honor Steve Jobs' legacy. Jobs reportedly hated the concept of full sized computers with a touch screen interface.
Keep in mind this news item does not stand alone. Together with touch screen Macs you have foldable iPhones being reportedly imminent.
Foldable iPhones is going to be quite disastrous for the iPad lineup. All, save perhaps for the biggest iPad. Having foldable iPhones means there is less reason to protect the iPad anymore and Jobs has been gone for a very long time. Touch screens have improved, the concept itself is much more popular and perhaps even expected, and its simply a matter of giving customers what they demand.
We still have to wait and see if foldables and touch macs actually happen though.

about time, touchscreen is nice option to have, mostly for the young generation, I also prefer mouse and keyboard for precise work, but tough is great for media consumption, would be great if they enable 360° hinge as well.

When I see "touchscreen", "OLED". and "MacBook Pro", I'm thinking that they're targeting graphic designers and others who will be using a stylus, or in this case the Apple Pencil.

Stray pet hair is easy to notice on a touch screen.
I highly recommend getting a screen with >350 nits brightness.
