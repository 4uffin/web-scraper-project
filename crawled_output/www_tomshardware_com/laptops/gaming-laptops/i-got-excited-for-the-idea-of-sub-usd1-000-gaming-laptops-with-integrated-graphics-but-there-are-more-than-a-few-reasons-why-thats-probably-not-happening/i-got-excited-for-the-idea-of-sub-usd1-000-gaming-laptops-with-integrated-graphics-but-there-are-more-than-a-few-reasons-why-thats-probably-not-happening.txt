There's been a trend the last two or three years in gaming laptops (and elsewhere) that no one likes: Prices are going up. It hasn't been surprising to see systems with the most powerful graphics, along with high-refresh displays, mechanical keyboards, or tons of RAM, to cost anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000, and more. See some of our most powerful picks like the MSI Titan 18 HX AI and the Razer Blade 18.But that same thing has been happening on the low end. Systems that used to be $999 or less are now often at least $1,100. Those laptops often use older processors and the lowest-end current GPUs.Up until Lenovo announced that its Legion Go 2 handheld would start at $1,049, I was thinking that handhelds might replace the best gaming laptops under $1,000.

We're in a place where it feels like we need something new to broaden what's available. Could gamers get a cheaper portable rig if they were willing to get handheld-style performance with integrated graphics?That might not sound so appealing, but the best thing for PC gamers is to have options, including gaming laptops with discrete GPUs at $1,000 or less if that is the best they can afford. But with an increase in integrated GPU power that we've seen in everything from laptop chips to handheld APUs to Strix Halo, along with the economies of scale that already build budget gaming PCs, could we finally see a new low-end gaming laptop with an iGPU?It’s a nice idea, but the more I thought it through with my colleagues, the more quickly my dreams were dashed.There's precedent, but it makes more sense nowBack in 2021, Adata released the XPG Xenia Xe. It was a whitebox system from Intel, but more importantly, it used Intel's Core i7-1165G7 CPU with integrated Intel Iris Xe graphics. Still, Adata referred to it as a "gaming lifestyle notebook.” Its predecessor, the Xenia 15, had used a GTX 1660 Ti. We saw a similar idea in Alienware's Concept UFO, which used a 10th Gen Intel CPU with integrated graphics to power the gaming handheld, but that never turned into a real product.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.I scoffed at the idea. My colleague at the time, Michelle Ehrhardt, titled her review of the system "expensive and unbalanced." It was $1,600. She was right.But what if the Xenia Xe hadn't been designed to be premium? I could see a version of that, using today's chips, making a new kind of low-end gaming laptop.Imagine an ultraportable-sized system, perhaps with a 14-inch, 1080p display up to 120 Hz, using something like the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme (or its most equivalent laptop part that exists). Other than some beefed up cooling, designs using largely plastic chassis that could work are probably already sitting on shelves.

What would make that gaming?On the other hand, there are laptops out there now with chips using AMD's Radeon 890M, though they're generally in premium ultrabooks. People do play games on those, the same way Apple's entire product line doesn't include a dedicated "gaming" laptop. There's no reason you couldn't use one of them, but they're probably priced higher than I'm thinking.So, now we have a theoretical plastic laptop with an otherwise strong chip that could, generously, play games at 1080p on medium settings. Hopefully, that could make for something affordable, even if it's not powerful.With handhelds, gamers accept that lack of power because they get portability. Gamers expect portability from laptops already. So what would make something like this a gaming laptop? What could give that value?For starters, I would want to see an OS focused on gaming. What if it was officially licensed to run SteamOS, and you could use Arch Linux for productivity? Or perhaps it could run Windows 11's upcoming handheld gaming mode that will debut on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally. In exchange for power, get rid of bloatware and give people a gaming-focused experience. Using one of these would also allow for game validation, like what the Steam Deck and upcoming Xbox Ally will offer, so you can get an idea if games will run. But honestly, these should be options on high-end machines, too.The laptop companies could also team up with Nvidia or Microsoft to get lengthy trial subscriptions to streaming services for games that may have trouble running well on integrated graphics.Lastly, if you're not paying for a discrete GPU, maybe toss a mechanical keyboard in there. It's not unprecedented. The Dell G16 previously had cheap configurations with a Cherry keyboard, and that was a great value-add (the Dell Gaming lineup has since been discontinued).There's also the question of which companies might be bold enough to put their gaming brand on a laptop without a discrete GPU.Counterpoint: The market is complexBut enough brainstorming. When you start to think about how things really work, this idea is harder than it seems.Take my thought that companies could stick a chip with strong integrated graphics in some existing system's chassis. They probably could, to some degree, but more cooling would still be helpful. And existing gaming laptop designs are built around the idea that a dedicated GPU is there, so tweaking that would require more tooling. Additionally, using an existing gaming chassis defeats the idea that you could get a slimmer laptop if you don't have a GPU to cool.Next up is that in most systems, the companies that make gaming laptops can pair the CPU and GPU they want together. That's why we're seeing so many RTX 50-series laptops with 13th Gen Intel Core CPUs — those CPUs are fast enough, and they're likely cheaper. Companies can mix and match to hit whatever price point they want. But APUs using graphics like Radeon 890M are the highest-end parts, paired with high-end CPU cores, and they're sold at a premium.If a laptop company wanted to make something like what I described, they might have to go to Intel or AMD and ask for something custom, and that would require a big order. (This is also what happened with the Steam Deck. Valve got a custom chip.)Otherwise, we're hoping Intel or AMD come around and make an SoC with a "good enough" CPU but the best GPU cores on the market. That doesn't seem likely, especially with limited fab capacity and a demand for higher-margin parts.In an ideal world, maybe one day, the companies that make these systems could bring costs back down. But realistically, I don't see that happening. That makes each gaming laptop below $1,000 a rare bird these days. And while an RTX xx50-class mobile GPU might not excite you, it's all some people can afford, especially as prices creep up.Despite the hardships of doing it cheaply, we are already seeing some steps down this road; they're just not cheap. After all, we saw AMD's Radeon 8060S with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 in the Framework Desktop, as well as in the Asus ROG Flow Z13. The latter is technically a laptop (well, tablet) and is selling for $2,400 on Best Buy. Admittedly, it would be easy to drop the price by using something without Strix Halo and 64GB of RAM. But even then, it’s probably not getting close to the sub $1,000 mark, at least until it goes on clearance.And companies that make gaming handhelds have been raising prices. If those devices sell, no company is going to have much incentive to put those in laptops at a lower price.Almost, but not quite, thereI think we're a lot closer to the idea of laptop gaming on integrated graphics than we've ever been. (You can argue it's been happening for a long time! People who want to game will find the means to play on any system they have.)On the other hand, people buy gaming laptops because they want to play games – usually modern AAA titles. Some of the initial handheld chips, like the Steam Deck's Aerith, are showing their age. This happens to all systems, eventually.That might just be the way games are now, with less optimization and more graphical capabilities (Nvidia and AMD are trying to sell their high-end GPUs, after all). But to call a laptop a gaming laptop, it really needs to play all of the games, at least for a while after launch. So maybe a few more iterations will be required before this idea is ready for prime time.But it also means we need to wait for great integrated graphics to get even cheaper for market forces to get in line. I think it would be great to see a true "gaming lifestyle notebook" that’s slim, powerful enough for most games, and ready with plenty of gaming features at the OS level. But with all of the factors making it tough on the low end, we'll have to settle for pricier Strix Halo experiments, at least for now.

The biggest reason is that you can find dGPU laptops under $1000. Granted they're usually the xx50 dGPU, like the RTX 5050 in the Lenovo LOQ 17 I see right now at B&H for $900 (on sale), but that's league's ahead of the Steam Deck in performance.
Aside from that if you want to stretch into cloud gaming, there's GeForce Now that'll stream to any cheap laptop, or even your phone, with sufficient internet access and on more than just Windows for under $200 a year.
Personally if I were to get excited it'd be for sub-$750 laptops that could do proper light gaming, though I'd also be excited for more PC laptops that could compete with the MacBook Air in terms of performance, battery life, and display and could also do light gaming.

I'm not 100% sure, but I'd have to imagine Strix Halo can hit the under-$1K BOM cost and sell close to it. The reason it's not, I'd have to image it's, well, greed and positioning.
Why do I think that? I'm starting to see heavily discounted Strix Halo systems already, so it means the reality check has caught up with AMD or the OEMs.

Realistically, an iGPU gaming laptop or handheld should cost under $1000, and closer to $550 for a Z1E/32GB/1TB/120Hz IPS.
$750 tops for one with a 120Hz OLED screen.
Valve knows their customer base all too well with their Steamdeck pricing.

Regards.There's also a limited market, the battery life isn't that great, you have to play with drastically reduced details, the price is fairly high, and if people already have a console or gaming PC then you have to convince them they need another gaming device they may not use that often or work that well as a handheld format with a tiny screen.

My Intel 285H laptop with a dedicated GPU runs surprisingly well when just using the iGPU. I can raid in WoW, play Minecraft, no issues. We’re just about to the point where this is/will be 100% a thing. Mind you, this laptop is a 2K display which makes it more impressive.

It can be done, but not with the first generation.
AMD didn't anticipate this much success to the Halo series, demand is way over the production and the limited number of chips plus the exclusive deal with HP & ASUS for the laptops made it a niche product.
I can't blame AMD for the first gen., as they can't predict how is the demand will be and how much they really need to make in order to make. As a new product with a new motherboard design and layout, not every laptop maker will be interested because it means a new motherboard & chassis design which not every OEM will be strong enough to try for a new product line.
AMD at first thought that they "might" allow mini-PC makers to use Halo product, but a few months later and we see so much more Mini-PC design with Strix-Halo while in the same time still only 2 actual laptops (PS another third leaked one from a unknown Chinese brand)
AMD's habit of making exclusive launch partners for mobile chips and the limited production volume really hampers their sales, A friend of mine waited over 8 months for a specific laptop to be released after they announced the mobile chips (the first Zen4 chips), all early laptops were gaming focused and he was waiting for a content creation laptop.

Do you really think that such a system will outperform a sub-$600 laptop with an H-series processor (say, an i5-13450H or a Ryzen 5 7535HS) and an RTX 3050? Don't budget gamers simply go for those?

Because my impression is that Halo has bombed and is actually a fiasco for AMD, thankfully hidden by loads of success elsewhere.
A lot of these Aliexpress mini-designs or NUCalikes are about selling excess notebook inventory that can't be sold as notebooks any more (or never sold there).
Intel NUCs basically started that trend and Intel used it heavily to get rid of nearly dead inventory, even if originally they thought they could make good money selling a partial laptop at a full laptop price, or even with a "NUC premium".
That idea didn't work out, but the surplus variant became a loss-reducer for Intel's "lost generations".

As a new product with a new motherboard design and layout, not every laptop maker will be interested because it means a new motherboard & chassis design which not every OEM will be strong enough to try for a new product line.I really don't know what AMD was thinking, apart from trying to win a race against Intel's Lunar Lake for doing a Fruity Cult Mx imitation job, that completely ignored that the Fruity Cult sells to a captive market.
But technically Strix Halo is designed to be cheap to produce computers with, using fewer and only commodity parts outside the bespoke IOD and CCDs--which would have been economical for AMD at giant scales.. except those scales don't exist within its very tight performance niche, where entry level mobile dGPUs have it look sad. And the unified memory angle is just too small of a niche for scale.

From the arrogance you hint at, they went to NUCalikes simply because whatever chip volumes they produced, those aren't selling like hotcakes in notebooks at current prices. And with the notebook market not having caught on by now, chances of it picking up in the second half of Halo's life-time, are slimmer there than going NUClear.
And even there I can only suggest that anyone looking at them stay cool for another six moths or so, and then grab them at 50% current or perhaps even 25% original list prices: anything already produced, especially 128GB SKUs, will soon become inventory hell.

They probably would have preferred to do without it, but laptops aren't EPYC.
And if AMD actually did limited chip production runs, they might have become somewhat wiser in terms of its potential success after finishing the design (which takes a few years, after all).
But then they can't really afford low production runs on Strix Halo either, because it did cost a ton of money to design and those chips, neither the IOD nor the CCDs very likely can be reused elsewhere (still waiting for die shots to confirm unique CCDs).
It's hard to gauge from the outside if Halo is more in the red from too few chips vs design cost or too much inventory that doesn't sell at the expected price point.
Laptop production runs are mostly adding another layer of risk as they have an even shorter time frame to return their investment on both design and production. If laptops aren't sold new, the next generation will drop their value very quickly, and once produced, they can't even be repurposed as NUCalikes, unless manufacturers fix their modularity issues.
So vendors have held back from doing premium AMD laptops, because they have never been halo products, where the price doesn't matter because customers buy them for bragging rights.
Perhaps Strix Halo was designed to overcome that, but it's just too weak for gaming, too expensive for the compromise it represents. I think both Intel's Lunar Lake and AMD's Strix Halo are Fruity Cult induced self-harm, only AMD can currently afford it.
But lets go back on topic:
Getting a good sub €1000 gaming laptop actually isn't that hard, you really just need to stay away from anything new and halo.
Because nobody designs good gaming laptops for €1000 RSP...
...but plenty will sell those laptops at below €1000, once their window of RSP sales opportunity has closed.
E.g. I've bought a Lenovo LOQ ARP9 laptop more than a year ago at €750, which included an RTX 4060 and a 'headless' Rembrand 7435HS 8 core APU, which is quite capable enough to keep that 4060 fed.
It's a really well-performing and rounded little 1080p gaming machine with a great 144Hz display and with the help of Nvidia's software tricks I believe it's very much where a Strix Halo would also be, but at a much cheaper price.
I also bought a Minisforum BD790i Mini-ITX mainboard with a Ryzen 9 7945HX included for less than €500, which will punch it's Strix Halo cousin into oblivion with any decent dGPU very likely for a lesser price.
That isn't a laptop, but uses a laptop part that likely has been NUCed into a consumer bargain, since those Dragon Range chips aren't selling great in laptops either. Yet in an MSI Alpha gaming laptop sold at €1600 with an RTX 4070 included a few months ago, it still offered quite a bit more gaming and workstation power in that form factor, and at a much lower price, than Strix Halo.
The only way to ensure that prices aren't creeping up higher and higher is to buy products at the price you want, not pay any price to get the products you want.

Mine came with an RTX 4060, at Microcenter for under $1k. I bought it new a year ago. Looking at the website they have a couple laptops with a 5060, for under $1k, new.
