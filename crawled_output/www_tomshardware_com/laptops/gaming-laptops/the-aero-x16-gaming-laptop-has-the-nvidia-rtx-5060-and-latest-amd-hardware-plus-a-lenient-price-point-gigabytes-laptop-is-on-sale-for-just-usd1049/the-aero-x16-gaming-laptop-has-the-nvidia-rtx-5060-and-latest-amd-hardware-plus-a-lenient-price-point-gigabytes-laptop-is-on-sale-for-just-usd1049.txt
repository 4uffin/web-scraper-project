Whether it's for work or play, a laptop can be very handy when you have to travel, set up in a small space, or fancy a change from sitting at a desktop. You can even pop out for a coffee and do some tasks. For myself, a gaming laptop doesn't have to have the most powerful components in the world stuffed inside of it; I have my desktop PC for the heavy lifting, but I do want enough oomph to be able to crank up the graphics a little and have a pleasant gaming experience.Using an AMD processor and Nvidia graphics, this laptop deal from Best Buy lets you get your hands on a pokey gaming machine for just a snip over $1000. Gigabyte's Aero X16 is currently just $1049.99, a saving of $450 from its original $1499.99 list price, and it seems exceptionally well-priced for a machine with a large screen and also the latest 50-series graphics.

The Gigabyte Aero X16 looks to be a well-rounded laptop from Gigabyte with plenty of gaming prowess and solid hardware choices for performance and budget. The Aero X16 has plenty of connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E, HDMI 2.1, a headphone/microphone combo jack, and multiple Type-C ports that include DisplayPort 1.4 and USB-PD 3.0 charging.There's even some gamified flair with customizable RGB backlighting on the keyboard, which not only makes the keys easier to find in a darkened room, but also adds the gaming aesthetic to what is otherwise a fairly unassuming slate-gray laptop with a relatively thin chassis.
