<![CDATA[ Valve's 256GB LCD Steam Deck is an incredible 20% off — big price drop just in time for the Steam Autumn Sale ]]>
<p>If you don't have a PC-based gaming handheld, it can be hard to comprehend what all the fuss is about. This is the fastest-growing sector of the PC gaming space, though, and there's a reason. If you'd like to find out for yourself why everyone from Asus to Zotac is making aming handhelds, you can try out the original Valve Steam Deck LCD with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">256GB SSD for just $319.20 right now, straight from Valve</a>.</p><p>The Steam Deck LCD has been slightly overshadowed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-oled" target="_blank">its younger OLED sibling</a>, but they're not far apart in gaming performance, and many of the games that you'd really want to play on a Steam Deck — indie titles like <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Holocure: Save the Fans</em>, <em>UFO 50</em>, <em>Celeste</em>, and <em>Hades</em> — are actually capped at 60 FPS and unable to take full advantage of the 90-Hz screen on the Steam Deck OLED anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Check out the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on Steam</a></li></ul><p>For $319.20, you get the original Steam Deck LCD with its 7" screen and 40-Whr battery (Valve touts 2-8 hours of gameplay; we found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" target="_blank">2-6 in our review</a>), a 45W power supply with 1.5-meter cable, and a carrying case.

We're likely to see deep discounts on delightful games that will play perfectly on the Steam Deck, like the ones we mentioned above, as well as titles like <em>Lost Castle II</em>, <em>30XX</em>, the <em>Shantae</em> series, <em>Cuphead</em>, the <em>Blasphemous</em> series, and the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Probably no sale on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/silksong-crashes-steam-nintendo-eshop-on-release-day-highly-anticipated-indie-video-game-took-six-years-to-arrive-and-is-already-one-of-the-most-played-games-ever-on-steam" target="_blank"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>, though.</p><p>Lest you think the Steam Deck is only suited for 2D games, though, rest assured, you can absolutely play titles like <em>Sifu</em>, <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>RoboQuest</em>, and even AAA releases like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/cyberpunk-2077-mac-benchmarks-show-most-apple-silicon-can-run-the-game-at-over-30-fps-on-medium-settings-results-vary-from-a-smooth-130-fps-to-a-cinematic-24-fps" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> — as long as you're willing to be realistic about the game settings and the longevity of your battery. If the game is marked as "Playable" or "Verified" on Steam (and in some cases, even if it isn't), you can play it on the Steam Deck.</p><p>There is the argument to be made that the Steam Deck LCD is one of the less impressive of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/best-pc-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">the current crop of PC gaming handhelds</a>, but as a counterpoint, we'll remark that the $200+ you save buying a Steam Deck LCD could go toward a whole bunch of games — especially with the deep discounts you're likely to see next week. Ultimately, unless performance is a real issue, the experience of playing a game on the Steam Deck OLED (or, say, an ASUS ROG Ally) is not going to be fundamentally different from the Steam Deck LCD.</p><p>It also must be noted that $319.20 is an awfully cheap way to get a full-on Linux PC with 16GB of memory and 256GB of fast solid-state storage. While the Steam Deck is hardly a powerhouse PC in 2025, it's still much faster than something like a Raspberry Pi or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi/lattepanda-mu-review" target="_blank">Lattepanda</a>, and it's fully open and hackable. There's nothing stopping you from using your Steam Deck in your own projects, or even simply as a desktop PC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-rog-ally-docking-station-has-enough-ports-to-turn-your-handheld-into-a-part-time-battlestation" target="_blank">with a compatible dock</a>.</p><p>If you're still not convinced, check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" target="_blank">our full review</a> of the Steam Deck, but be aware that things have changed a lot in the three years and seven months since its release.

<![CDATA[ AI buildouts need $2 trillion in annual revenue to sustain growth, but massive cash shortfall looms — even generous forecasts highlight $800 billion black hole, says report ]]>
<p>AI’s insatiable power appetite is both expensive and unsustainable. That’s the main takeaway from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-can-we-meet-ais-insatiable-demand-for-compute-power-technology-report-2025/" target="_blank">new report by Bain & Company</a>, which puts a staggering number on what it will cost to keep feeding AI’s compute appetite — more than $500 billion per year in global data-center investment by 2030, with $2 trillion in annual revenue required to make that capex viable. Even under generous assumptions, Bain estimates the AI industry will come up $800 billion short.</p><p>It’s a sobering reality check for the narrative currently surrounding AI, one that cuts through the trillion-parameter hype cycles and lands squarely in the physics and economics of infrastructure. If Bain is right, the industry is hurtling toward a wall where power constraints, limited GPU availability, and capital bottlenecks converge.</p><p>The crux of Bain’s argument is that compute demand is scaling faster than the tools that supply it. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ceo-says-moores-law-is-slowing-to-a-three-year-cadence-but-its-not-dead-yet">Moore’s Law has slowed to a crawl</a>, AI workloads haven’t. Bain estimates that inference and training requirements have grown at more than twice the rate of transistor density, forcing data center operators to brute-force scale rather than rely on per-chip efficiency gains. The result is a global AI compute footprint that could hit 200 GW by 2030, with half of it in the U.S. alone.</p><p>That kind of headache is going to require massive, borderline inconceivable upgrades to local grids, years-long lead times on electrical gear, and thousands of tons of high-end cooling. Worse, many of the core enabling silicon, like HBM and CoWoS, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/hbm-supply-from-sk-hynix-and-micron-sold-out-until-late-2025">already supply-constrained</a>. Nvidia’s own commentary this year, echoed in Bain’s report, suggests that demand is outstripping the industry’s ability to deliver on every axis except pricing.</p><p>If capital dries up or plateaus, hyperscalers will double down on systems that offer the best return per watt and per square foot. That elevates full-rack GPU platforms like Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-mi300x-performance-compared-with-nvidia-h100">AMD’s Instinct MI300X</a> pods, where thermal density and interconnect efficiency dominate the BOM. It also deprioritizes lower-volume configs, especially those based on mainstream workstation parts and, by extension, cuts down the supply of chips that could’ve made their way into high-end desktops.</p><p>There are also implications on the PC side. If training remains cost-bound and data-center inference runs into power ceilings, more of the workload shifts to the edge. That plays directly into the hands of laptop and desktop OEMs now shipping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-reveals-cheapest-ryzen-ai-yet-ai-5-330-is-a-quad-core-budget-processor-with-a-50-tops-npu">NPUs in the 40 to 60 TOPS range</a>, and Bain’s framing helps explain why: Inference at the edge isn’t just faster, it’s also cheaper and less capital-intensive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the race continues. Microsoft recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-announces-worlds-most-powerful-ai-data-center-315-acre-site-to-house-hundreds-of-thousands-of-nvidia-gpus-and-enough-fiber-to-circle-the-earth-4-5-times">bumped its Wisconsin AI data-center</a> spend to more than $7 billion. Amazon, Meta, and Google are each committing billions more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/xai-pushes-power-strategy-towards-1gw-ai-factory">as is xAI</a>, but most of that funding is already spoken for in terms of GPU allocation and model development. As Bain points out, even those aggressive numbers may not be enough to bridge the cost-to-revenue delta.</p><p>If anything, this report reinforces the tension at the heart of the current AI cycle. On one side, you have infrastructure that takes years to build, staff, and power. On the other hand, you have models that double in size and cost every six months, giving credence to the fears of an AI bubble that, if it continues to grow, will mean high-end silicon and the memory and cooling that come with it could stay both scarce and expensive well into the next decade.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Intel drops day zero game driver support for chips released last year — last-gen iGPUs on 14th-gen Core and older CPUs already put on the backburner of legacy software support ]]>
<p>Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000101986/graphics.html">The company says</a> that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.</p><p>This announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new —
the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.</p><p>While an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-axes-thousands-of-technicians-and-engineers-in-sweeping-u-s-layoffs-cutting-4-000-positions-in-the-u-s-2-392-in-oregon">Intel has cut 4,000 positions</a> in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.</p><p>Still, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.</p><p>Nevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6s-modest-system-requirements-open-the-doors-to-gamers-of-all-budgets-six-year-old-gpus-meet-minimum-recommendations" target="_blank">the upcoming Battlefield 6</a>, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.</p><p>Even though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ This $12 external CD/DVD drive plays your old discs through a modern USB-C interface — at 35% off, this drive is an exceptional deal at Amazon ]]>
<p>I recently encountered an issue where I needed to retrieve data from an old DVD backup disk, but I had no access to a disk drive on either my laptop or PC. Who even uses physical media these days? Well... this guy. It might be the first time in years that I've even thought about this problem, and definitely over a decade since I've used a CD/DVD to backup anything, but now that I want to access some of the old media I've found in the attic, I'm stuck. The number of times I'm probably going to use a drive means I don't want to spend too much on one, and with a swathe of generic drives available, I've found a great deal on one at Amazon that costs next to nothing.</p><p>Available at Amazon for the low price of just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5V3RV3X">$12.99, the Gotega External USB 3.0 Type C CD/DVD Drive</a> is a bargain at this price.

<![CDATA[ Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 2TB SSD Review: A Rhapsody in Blue ]]>
<p>Thanks to the performance we see with the Sandisk WD Blue SN5100, the market now has not just one great QLC SSD, but <em>two</em> great QLC SSDs. This turn of events was unfathomable a generation of drives ago, but the components are now mature enough to offer great value for everyday users and storage enthusiasts alike. We were first impressed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review"><u>Crucial's P310,</u></a> but the Blue SN5100 has quietly come along to redefine what a QLC drive can do.</p><p>Sandisk has followed up on the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>SN8100</u></a> with another compelling mid-range Blue drive, bumping performance up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-sn5000-4tb-ssd-review"><u>SN5000</u></a>. The Blue drives have always been a popular and inexpensive option, but in some cases, the different models felt overlapping, even with some of the lower-end Black drives, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn770-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>SN770</u></a>. It’s almost too much of a good thing. Now, with the SN5100 coming in hot with QLC flash, which the previous SN5000 only used at 4TB, we have a drive designed for everyone.</p><p>All of WD’s and Sandisk’s many Blue NVMe SSDs have been good budget performers to the point that it sometimes gets confusing to discern one from another; the controllers and flash used are scalable in that way. The Blue SN5100 carries on with this tradition, but it’s also marking the full transition from TLC to QLC flash. This might horrify some people, but the fact is, this drive performs well for 99% of typical users. You’d have difficulty in a blind taste test between this and the TLC-equipped Black SN7100, and if Sandisk can get the price down to an appropriate level, that’s a very attractive reality.</p><p>We still prefer the Blue SN5100 as a secondary or game-focused drive, or perhaps as a budget laptop upgrade drive, but we think it’s to the point that this drive could work anywhere. It feels like it could replace low-end TLC options without issue. There’s something about this drive that puts it ahead of the pack in comparison to some of the older QLC drives, mostly due to the flash. It’s power-efficient and has excellent latency, which makes it <em>feel</em> like a high-end drive a lot of the time. It’s a shame that QLC flash isn’t holding its discount due to enterprise demand because this drive at an optimal price level would be nearly unbeatable. It’s still a drive worth keeping an eye on.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-specifications-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 Specifications</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Product</p></th><th

QLC flash can be tricky at lower capacities like 500GB, as there are fewer dies with which to interleave. Performance on this drive is best at 1TB and 2TB, but there will be much interest in the 4TB. The drive can hit up to 7,100 / 6,700 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,000K / 1,300K random read and write IOPS.</p><p>Pricing at the time of the review was a problem, though, at $54.99, $79.98, and $142.99 for the smaller SKUs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN7100</u></a> is, in fact, less expensive and, with TLC flash, is the better drive. In fact, that model is an excellent value all around. We suspect the Blue SN5100 will be adjusted below that pricing – that’s the only way the Blue and Black monikers make sense relative to one another — which would make it potentially a fantastic budget SSD.</p><p>Sandisk backs the drive with a standard five-year warranty, but the write endurance (TBW) is half the normal, at 300TB of write data per TB os drive capacity. This is not unexpected, as base QLC flash tends to be rated for about half the program/erase cycles as the comparable TLC. This does not reflect actual NAND flash endurance, but rather the TBW is chosen for warranty purposes. This drive isn’t supposed to be beaten up with tons of writes, and enterprise-like workloads can and will wear the flash worse than normal consumer usage. We don’t think this write limit holds back the drive for its intended purpose in any way.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-software-and-accessories-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 Software and Accessories</h2><p>Sandisk has two downloads for its SSDs: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support-en.sandisk.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/31759"><u>SanDisk Dashboard</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.sandisk.com/topics/ssd/sandisk-desk-drive-getting-started"><u>Acronis True Image</u></a>. The former is an SSD Toolbox application previously known as the WD Dashboard – if you see that in our past reviews, know that the new dashboard covers both WD and Sandisk SSDs. This dashboard is roughly on par with Samsung’s Magician and is useful for a range of things. Aside from letting you update the drive’s firmware, it also allows you to check and monitor drive health and engage features such as TRIM and secure erase. This application is only for Windows, but True Image also works on macOS. True Image is designed for backups and imaging to protect your data when switching drives, which is always a useful feature.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-a-closer-look-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100: A Closer Look</h2><div class="inlinegallery

This drive would work in a shorter form factor. The drive does have a QR code PSID, but it is otherwise uninteresting.</p><p>A 4TB SKU is on the way and is also single-sided. With current technology, such a drive would have two NAND flash packages with the standard 1Tb dies, but could theoretically get away with just one with 2Tb dies. There is a performance dip for the 4TB models, according to the datasheet, which would be either from extra memory addressing overhead with the latter solution or an abundance of dies in the former. WD could also choose to use 2Tb dies with two NAND flash packages to take advantage of better yields. One reason to stick with a single package is if there is intent for shorter form factors in an OEM counterpart, particularly as such drives tend to be single-sided.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN7100</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN8100</u></a> use the TLC version of this flash and show no performance loss at their maximum capacities at the time of our reviews, but we know the controllers are able to handle that many 1Tb dies without an issue. The Black SN7100 has been updated with a 4TB SKU post-review, which does exhibit a similar performance drop as the SN5100, and in that case, it’s due to the use of so many 1Tb dies. To condense this into something understandable: you are going to see some level of performance loss at the highest capacity of these drives. That may impact the upcoming 8TB Black SN8100 as well, unless Sandisk has a trick up its sleeve. This was avoided with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn850x-8tb-ssd-review-the-no-compromise-8tb-champion" target="_blank"><u>8TB WD Black SN850X,</u></a> which utilized newer, denser flash, a strategy later adopted by Samsung with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/samsung-990-pro-4tb-ssd-review"><u>4TB 990 Pro</u></a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is a simple four-channel DRAM-less controller made to optimally run with 16 dies at 2400 MT/s, which translates to 2TB at 7+ GB/s. BiCS8 is rated for up to 3,600 MT/s, but this is not needed for PCIe 4.0. For PCIe 5.0, this flash with a similar controller, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e31t-es-2tb-review"><u>Phison E31T</u></a>, can hit up to at least 10 GB/s. There are advantages other than bandwidth for running at a higher I/O speed, such as slightly better latency. However, running at a lower clock is more power-efficient. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> demonstrates this well by having the best power efficiency we’ve seen to date.</p><p>The Blue SN5100 differs from the Black SN7100 by its use of QLC rather than TLC flash. In practice, this isn’t as big a deal as it sounds. In pSLC mode, the flash will perform similarly, and QLC often has optimizations for reads, which might come from native flash. You might never notice a difference between the two. QLC flash does have lower endurance with approximately half the rated amount, depending on the flash and quality, but this is still an immense amount of writes that 99% of users won’t ever hit. Nevertheless, performance concerns do remain for the worst-case, which cannot be denied. We cover this in our write saturation test.</p><p>QLC flash <em>should</em> be more affordable as a trade-off, but this often has not been the case. One reason is that enterprise demand for QLC flash is higher than ever to handle large data with far better response times than a mechanical HDD provides. This has gotten worse with the AI and LLM booms, especially considering that the YMTC flash, which could alleviate this shortfall to some degree, has been politically problematic for the U.S.</p><p>Most inexpensive 4TB drives with QLC use YMTC flash, in fact, while Micron is holding back its QLC for enterprise and its own drives. That would include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P310</u></a> and the OEM Micron 2600. Historically, BiCS has not made a big splash with QLC flash and has been mostly only available in TLC. This completely changes with the Blue SN5100 as a follow-up to the Blue SN5000.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p><h2 id="comparison-products-2">Comparison Products</h2><p>The Blue SN51000 must be understood within the context of Sandisk’s own SSD product stack.

It’s right up there with the T500 and P310. It should perform close to the Black SN7100, and it does, because both drives are using very similar hardware. In any pSLC mode – and most benchmarks fall into this category, as does the vast majority of real-world drive use – the drives should perform identically. If you’re using a drive as your primary boot device and tend to have that main drive very full, the results will likely differ from this. In that case, the SN7100, with TLC flash, would be the better choice, and that goes for the T500 with DRAM as well. The 990 EVO Plus is also a good choice for that over the QLC-based options. All three drives now come with a 4TB option, which reduces the QLC advantage.</p><p>It’s important to recognize that even though our results aren’t falsely optimistic, we do prepare the drives to get more realistic data before testing. There are many scenarios and edge cases where performance differences between drives will be different and more exaggerated. To condense that down, know your workloads and usage patterns, and apply that to our data. If your drive isn’t heavily used and is well-maintained, then the SN5100 <em>will</em> perform in the best of its class. If not, it may be lower on this list. That consideration must play into your purchase decision, as you can save a significant amount of money over the T500 for an effectively identical experience most of the time.</p><h2 id="console-testing-playstation-5-transfers-2">Console Testing — PlayStation 5 Transfers</h2><p>The PlayStation 5 is capable of taking one additional PCIe 4.0 or faster SSD for extra game storage. While any PCIe 4.0 drive will technically work, Sony recommends drives that can deliver at least 5,500 MB/s of sequential read bandwidth for optimal performance. In our testing, PCIe 5.0 SSDs don’t bring much to the table and generally shouldn’t be used in the PS5, especially as they may require additional cooling.

While QLC flash technically has higher latency than TLC, long-term reads will not come from the temporary pSLC cache; optimizations and software bottlenecks have made this moot. As you saw in our 3DMark and PCMark 10 sections, the Blue SN5100 is quite capable of being a responsive drive in normal situations. If this drive is priced right at higher capacities, we see it as an absolute win for console users, especially as the drive runs cool without any modification.</p><h2 id="transfer-rates-diskbench-2">Transfer Rates — DiskBench</h2><p>We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom, 50GB dataset.

Due to how flash operates, reads will be faster than writes, so you can usually gauge the copy speed from just the write speed. Smaller transfers, including this 50GB dataset, will usually be fully in the pSLC cache, so the results here are under ideal circumstances. We have to mention that, as the Blue SN5100 is a QLC-based drive, and larger transfers with a fuller drive can and will copy more slowly.</p><p>With that out of the way, we see the T500 come out on top, with the Blue SN5100 impressively coming in second. It performs effectively the same as the Black SN7100, which is not surprising given that the two drives use very similar hardware. The T500 utilizes six-plane flash and features DRAM, making it difficult to beat here. The P310 uses the same generation of Micron flash, but in QLC with just four planes. BiCS8 is also a four-plane design, which may be one reason it has better latency, while Micron’s newest flash is more bandwidth-focused. This includes the newest QLC flash – we’re working on getting a Micron 2600 sample so we can better elaborate on this.</p><p>If you lean more towards latency and especially power efficiency, then the Blue SN5100 makes a lot of sense. It puts the P310 in its place, and the latency gap might only grow with Micron’s newer QLC flash. Then again, the 2600 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/micron-2600-qlc-ssd-uses-flexible-caching-to-offer-tlc-like-performance-7-200-mb-s-reads-and-6-500-mb-s-writes-push-the-limits-of-pcie-4-0" target="_blank"><u>flexible caching,</u></a> which breaks this discussion wide open once we get to PCIe 5.0. It’s just difficult to recommend the P310 over the Blue SN5100 at the same price when the latter is just better balanced in hardware in our opinion. That’s saying something because the P310 is already an immensely popular drive that hit all the right notes in our review.</p><h2 id="synthetic-testing-atto-crystaldiskmark-2">Synthetic Testing — ATTO / CrystalDiskMark</h2><p>ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products.

smoothly with only minor dips at 2MiB for read and write workloads in the ATTO benchmark. The Black SN7100, in comparison, retains its curve at the highest block sizes for reads. This could be due to differences in the QLC and TLC flash, respectively. We do have to point out that the P310, on the whole, is more consistent here, although it’s unlikely you will be transferring data at very specific sizes.</p><p>We’ve already seen in DiskBench that a real-world transfer favors the Blue SN5100. Moreover, at the typical 1MB block size in CrystalDiskMark, the Blue SN5100 offers excellent sequential performance regardless of queue depth. You will be able to eke out more with the Black SN7100’s TLC flash for writes, though. If we have to leave a caveat here, it’s this: we’re only looking at 2TB+ performance, and at lower capacities, the P310 should perform more favorably.</p><p>For latency, we see that BiCS8’s ability to be in a class of its own for QD1 random 4K reads carries over to the QLC version of the flash. It’s not as good as the TLC on the Black SN7100, but it’s darn good compared to the rest of the drives on this list. If this is the metric you care about most, then you can probably stop reading here and be satisfied in picking up one of the two WD drives. You would still have to read the entire review to see where to buy one over the other, though.</p><p>For write latency, we see these fall behind the P310, Rocket 4, and T500. The T500 is understandable as it’s using DRAM, and the Rocket 4 is using BiCS6 TLC flash with the excellent Phison E27T controller. The one result that might confuse is the P310, but we are reminded that Micron’s 232-Layer QLC flash on the drive is four-plane with optimizations for this kind of workload. Writes are usually in pSLC mode, so performance can be deceptive. To be fair to the P310, this result bolsters its application as a primary or singular drive, where frequent updates may be common. That said, we think any one of these drives would be adequate for everyday use.</p><h2 id="sustained-write-performance-and-cache-recovery-2">Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery</h2><p>Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache, which is a fast area of pseudo-SLC (single-bit) programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the "native" TLC (three-bit) or QLC (four-bit) flash. Performance can suffer even more if the drive is forced to fold, which is the process of migrating data out of the cache in order to free up space for further incoming data.</p><p>We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds. This process shows the performance of the drive in various states as well as the steady state write performance.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is a hybrid pSLC cache, meaning that the cache has both static and dynamic portions. This is similar to Samsung’s TurboWrite technology. The static portion lies outside of user space and is, as a result, is relatively small, but this cache is always available regardless of the amount of data stored on the drive. Being separate from the rest of the flash and cache, it provides a way to handle smaller and random writes in a portion of the drive that usually has much higher endurance. It also helps defer or combine writes in a way that reduces overall wear. The dynamic portion of the cache, on the other hand, will vary in size with the amount of data stored on the drive. The maximum cache size will also vary with overall drive capacity.</p><p>In our testing, the 2TB SKU of the Blue SN5100 was able to write at 6.45 GB/s for over 78 seconds. The cache is over 500GB, which is close to the maximum amount possible for a 2TB drive of QLC flash. QLC flash operates in a 4-bit mode, while the pSLC cache operates in a 1-bit mode; therefore, the cache is necessarily at most one-quarter the size of all flash.</p><p>The full amount of flash on a drive is more than is available to the user, and there must be accounting for the decimal versus binary capacity discrepancy. It’s likely that having a static portion for caching reduces the amount available for the dynamic portion, in part because the controller does need extra space for system functions and to have free blocks for future writes. Sandisk also appears capable of performing some magic with caching, given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Black SN8100's</u></a> high steady-state write performance.</p><p>If, for some reason, you exhaust the cache, the drive is then forced to write directly to the QLC flash and/or will hit a slower folding state where it must wait for flash to be moved over from the cache in order to free up needed space. This yields a steady state write rate of 442 MB/s, which is low but not bad for QLC flash. The other QLC-based drives in our test did worse, including the P310, except for the Blue SN5000, which has more dies to work with at 4TB. The Black SN7100 is less than double the Blue SN5100’s speed, but we don’t know the raw difference in flash speed. Usually, TLC flash is about 2.5 to 3 times faster than QLC, but both of these drives are using very large caches and are no doubt tuned differently than the eight-channel, DRAM-equipped Black SN8100.</p><p>To bring things back into focus: this drive is slow when the cache is full, but it’s still fast enough to hang with SATA SSDs. You shouldn’t really be getting to that point with a budget drive. However, if you care about sustained performance, there are many better drives available. You always want to be looking for TLC flash in that case, and usually smaller caches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/the-crucial-p510-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P510</u></a> is almost a perfect example, even though it’s four-channel and DRAM-less. You want DRAM and eight channels for the heaviest tasks. That’s <em>not</em> the audience for the Blue SN5100, though. This drive is made for light use, for laptops, as a gaming drive, etc. It has enough performance here for that, even in suboptimal conditions.</p><h2 id="power-consumption-and-temperature-2">Power Consumption and Temperature</h2><p>We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider, especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ultrabooks-premium-laptops"><u>best ultrabooks</u></a> can have mediocre stock storage. Desktops may be more performance-oriented with less support for power-saving features, so we show the worst-case.</p><p>Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt, or efficiency, is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload, but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly, ultimately saving energy.</p><p>For temperature recording we currently poll the drive’s primary composite sensor during testing with a ~22°C ambient. Our testing is rigorous enough to heat the drive to a realistic ceiling temperature.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is something we may continue to do moving forward with datasheets that indicate this information. Generally, we prefer to look at our real-world results, but in this case, Sandisk lists both read and write average power use – 4.1W for each on the 2TB. Our write-heavy testing peaked at 4.12W with an average of around 3W. As far as we’re concerned, that means Sandisk is bang-on with their data. The S.M.A.R.T. reading indicates the drive can peak up to 5W, but this information is not always reliable, and we tend to measure peaks at a more realistic value.</p><p>The Blue SN5100 is, as expected, fantastically power-efficient. There’s no question this drive is a great choice if you are at all worried about power draw or thermal output. The controller in use here is not the most efficient design on paper, but Sandisk’s ability to tune it for a specific purpose makes for a great pairing with the very power-efficient BiCS8 flash. This flash isn’t running full bore, and this is a PCIe 4.0 drive, so that does help to some degree, but PCIe 5.0 drives can finish our workload faster and do quite well. Consider that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN8100</u></a> is on par in power efficiency with the Blue SN5100. This demonstrates how effective optimization can be when you tune with scalable hardware.</p><p>Our test bench will run cooler than many systems – the ambient would be higher with heavy CPU and GPU loads in an enclosed case, depending on the cooling solution – but it’s still a predictable way to compare different drives. The Blue SN5100 hit a maximum temperature of 53°C during our write test, which is approximately 37°C below the serious throttling point. This drive is simply a gold mine for laptop and HTPC users, and for full-length capable portable computer systems users. Many, if not most, of these are still running PCIe 4.0 slots will have read-heavy workloads, which favors QLC flash just fine. This might be better as a secondary drive for a serious desktop PC build, though.</p><h2 id="test-bench-and-testing-notes-2">Test Bench and Testing Notes</h2><div ><table><caption>Test Bench and Testing Notes</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>CPU</strong></p></td><td

We do judge drives both relatively and absolutely, which means that sometimes the score may seem out of place. The Blue SN5100 is one such situation where it feels better than the P310 on the whole, but nothing in its DNA screams that it’s a 4.5 drive. One reason for this is that the Blue SN5100 right now is priced far too high to make it competitive with the fast-selling P310. Another reason is that you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> with TLC flash at a very good price. We gave <em>that </em>drive a 3/5 because its performance was frankly last-gen, but in lieu of the price trends that came after – with QLC flash especially being less competitive – you could put it above the P310 and Blue SN5100.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

At an appropriate price point, it simply <em>is</em> the better drive. Most users will never experience its slowest state – which, to be honest, isn’t even that bad – and it’s one cool customer. You can integrate it into any system and expect good results without needing to adjust cooling or other settings. That’s also true of the Black SN7100, but we feel that the Blue SN5100 is a better fit for its specific market segment. It’s a great secondary or game drive at up to 4TB, and when the pricing is corrected – WD and Sandisk have been aggressive here recently – it should deliver an experience equal to the Black SN7100 at a lower price. That’s why this drive gets a higher score.</p><p>If you want TLC flash, you would go with the Black SN7100, right? Well, frankly, there are better TLC-based drives like the Rocket 4 if you actually are worried about sustained write performance, for instance. The Black SN7100’s greatest strength is its power efficiency, which is great for laptops but less meaningful in desktops. Its saving grace is that it’s priced so aggressively. On an even field, it’s simply an average drive overall. And the market agrees with us because not only is Crucial’s P310 selling well, but there is a history of “cheap” drives selling well going back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-p3-plus-ssd-review-capacity-on-the-cheap"><u>P3 Plus</u></a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-p2-m-2-nvme-ssd"><u>P2</u></a> before that. People want inexpensive drives. We think the P310 delivers on that, but if prices are equal, we would favor the Blue SN5100, so take that into consideration.</p><p>If you want this general range of performance with power efficiency but demand DRAM, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-2tb-t500-ssd-review"><u>Crucial T500</u></a> remains the way to go. It has some issues with sustained writes, which, if important to you, means you should consider something more high-end, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review-back-in-black" target="_blank"><u>WD Black SN850X</u></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/samsung-990-pro-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Samsung 990 Pro</u></a>. Drives based on Phison’s E18 also apply, but recent reports of firmware-caused sluggishness persist. The good news is that Phison has fixed firmware coming to its drives. If you’re looking the other way to even cheaper drives, then there are still mid-range champions like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn770-ssd-review"><u>WD Black SN770</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-sn5000-4tb-ssd-review/2"><u>Blue SN5000</u></a>, but they must be less expensive to make sense. Many other drives in that segment have varying hardware, which can be unpredictable.</p><p>Aside from competing for a spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" target="_blank"><u>Best SSDs list</u></a>, we can confidently state that the Blue SN5100 is impressive on its own. BiCS8 flash continues to exceed our expectations in performance, especially latency, and power efficiency alike. Sandisk’s controllers also remain well-optimized and reliable.

<![CDATA[ OpenAI makes flurry of deals in drive towards for-profit model — AI giant teams up with Nvidia, Luxshare, Apple, and more ]]>
<p>Following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/uk-cosies-up-to-big-tech-with-usd42-billion-data-center-and-ai-investment-deal">joint announcements of major UK investments last week</a>, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has kicked off this one with a slew of new deals to enhance its own capabilities and increase its valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The company struck a deal for Nvidia hardware worth upwards of $100 billion, a deal with Chinese firm Luxsure to begin building consumer AI devices, and there are several negotiations said to be ongoing with other Chinese Apple suppliers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/apple-supplier-luxshare-shares-pop-10percent-on-report-of-openai-hardware-deal.html" target="_blank">according to CNBC</a>.</p><p>The story of OpenAI in 2025 has been one of aggressive expansion and incredibly optimistic projections about where the industry is headed and the significant role OpenAI is expected to play in it. Despite the company being structured as a non-profit and its yearly revenue projections topping out at just under $13 billion (following a $5 billion loss in 2024), it has announced investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure. These include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-oracle-ink-deal-to-build-massive-stargate-data-center-total-project-will-power-2-million-ai-chips-stargate-partner-softbank-not-involved-in-the-project">US-based Stargate scheme</a> and the Stargate UK project, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-it-will-expand-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-to-the-uae-starting-with-a-1gw-cluster">amongst other international investments</a>.</p><p>For these kinds of investments to be possible, OpenAI needs to restructure as a for-profit company, which it can now do after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-microsoft-reach-an-understanding-over-ongoing-contract-negotiations-but-agi-clause-remains-an-uncertainty">recent progress in its Microsoft negotiations</a>. It also needs the cash generated from a potential IPO, with some estimates already valuing the company at over $500 billion, despite its lack of any kind of actual profitability.</p><p>In reality, the bulk of that valuation comes from the confidence of other major tech companies. Microsoft is already one of the largest OpenAI investors, but now Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI too. Though that may well be a form of circuitous, parasitic relationship where Nvidia invests money in OpenAI, so it can, in turn, purchase Nvidia hardware for its various data center projects.</p><p>Crucially, however, this deal also marks OpenAI as one of the first customers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-enterprise-roadmap-rubin-rubin-ultra-feynman-and-silicon-photonics">Nvidia's next-generation hardware</a>. This deal will see Nvidia invest an initial $10 billion once the deal is agreed upon, with the first Nvidia hardware set to be delivered in late 2026. These chips will be Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, likely offering significant performance and efficiency advantages over existing Blackwell GPUs.</p><p>More Nvidia investment will be forthcoming as further gigawatts of computing power are set up, with the final project said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/" target="_blank">equate to around 10 gigawatts</a> of AI compute power. The electricity use alone would be enough to power over 8 million homes.</p><h2 id="ouroboros-ai-2">Ouroboros AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

"On the other hand, the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further."</p><p>Nvidia, Microsoft, Intel, OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and a range of other multi-billion and trillion-dollar companies have all announced major investments in each other's companies and services over the coming years. Although there are very real services these companies can offer each other, the kind of AI projects they all want to launch will require incredible infrastructure development, which will require Herculean levels of investment. This raises concerns about whether the funds will be available when the time comes to actually pay up.</p><p>There is the very real potential of the AI industry becoming an unsustainable bubble. When those have burst in the past, they tend to take entire companies with them.
If anything like that happens before OpenAI (and others) can realize their goals, they could be left with enormous promises and balance sheets that are deep in the red.</p><h2 id="a-physical-path-to-profitability-2">A physical path to profitability</h2><p>Alongside its drive towards IPO cash generation, OpenAI is also looking to diversify as it searches for a viable profit model for its soon-to-be for-profit company.

It's also alleged to be in talks with Goertek, a Chinese company that builds Apple's AirPods and other smart devices.</p><p>In a more tangible endeavour, it's now struck a deal with fellow Chinese Apple supplier, Luxshare, to build a smart-speaker-like device to use with ChatGPT.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia promises its $100 billion OpenAI deal won't impact GPU supply — 'we will continue to make every customer a top priority' ]]>
<p>Nvidia wants to make it clear that, despite any deals it's done with certain companies to provide future hardware, it will still ensure all customers get access to next-generation GPUs, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/nvidia-to-invest-100-billion-in-openai-in-ai-computing-buildout" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. This follows the announcement of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-and-openai-forge-usd100-billion-alliance-to-deliver-10-gigawatts-of-nvidia-hardware-for-ai-datacenters">$100 billion Nvidia investment in OpenAI</a>, which will see the chip giant give OpenAI money, so that it can purchase Nvidia's GPUs in a circular strategy that has buoyed both companies since the announcement was made.</p><p>"Our investments will not change our focus or impact supply to our other customers--we will continue to make every customer a top priority, with or without any equity stake," an Nvidia spokesperson told Toms Hardware in a statement.</p><p>That may be of some comfort to Nvidia's other customers, but it's also likely to be a strategy to placate them into not looking elsewhere. Nvidia became the world's most valuable company in recent years because of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/elon-musk-took-19-days-to-set-up-100-000-nvidia-h200-gpus-process-normally-takes-4-years"> scramble to buy its cutting-edge GPUs </a>in order to power a new generation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-is-building-100-ai-factories-jensens-50-year-gambit-begins">"AI factories"</a> and AI training and inference data centers. But that hasn't stopped those same companies from looking for alternative sources lest Nvidia itself become a bottleneck, through chip supply issues or granting favour to one company over another.</p><p>Other major chip firms like Nvidia competitor AMD <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/tensorwave-just-deployed-the-largest-amd-gpu-training-cluster-in-north-america-features-8-192-mi325x-ai-accelerators-tamed-by-direct-liquid-cooling">do offer their own AI hardware</a>. It might not be as impressive as Nvidia's and lacks the CUDA ecosystem, which has helped give Nvidia such a near-monopoly in the professional GPU space for many years, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-announces-mi350x-and-mi355x-ai-gpus-claims-up-to-4x-generational-gain-up-to-35x-faster-inference-performance">its hardware is capable nonetheless</a>. If Nvidia were unable to meet its commitments, or indeed appears to be favoring one company over another, customers may start to look for alternative solutions in order to give themselves more control over their AI supply chain.</p><p>To that end, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others are all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/microsofts-own-ai-chip-delayed-six-months-in-major-setback-in-house-chip-now-reportedly-expected-in-2026-but-wont-hold-a-candle-to-nvidia-blackwell">developing their own AI-accelerating hardware</a> to give them some independence from Nvidia, even if it seems unlikely any of them will be able to offer a competitive product to Nvidia's GPUs any time soon. Chinese firms have also been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chinas-chip-champions-ramp-up-production-of-ai-accelerators-at-domestic-fabs-but-hbm-and-fab-production-capacity-are-towering-bottlenecks">making major efforts to untether themselves from Nvidia</a> amidst ongoing trade negotiations and tariff talks with the United States.</p><p>Other Nvidia investments, which are likely to give other actual or potential customers pause, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">include the Intel deal</a>, which will see Nvidia work together with the CPU giant to fabricate new chips that combine their hardware into a single chip. Nvidia's recent investment and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-drops-a-cool-usd900-million-on-enfabrica-tech-and-hiring-its-ceo-report-claims-ai-networking-chip-company-boasts-capacity-to-connect-100-000-gpus-together">pseudo-takeover of GPU networking hardware firm Enfabrica</a> also smacks of Nvidia shoring up its near-monopoly in the AI hardware space.</p><p>But with the world rushing to develop AI infrastructure as fast as possible, there seems likely to be plenty of scope for competition to find purchase. AMD is one such potential alternative, but Qualcomm is working on its own accelerators, and if Chinese innovation in the space has shown us anything in the past couple of years, it's that they can surprise with their speed and capabilities.

<![CDATA[ MediaTek reportedly mulling US chip production — could use TSMC's Arizona fab to avoid tariff fallout ]]>
<p>MediaTek is negotiating production of certain chips in the U.S. with TSMC in a bid to meet customer requirements for locally manufactured components. While the plan is still under evaluation, if MediaTek manages to place orders through TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona, it will be the first non-American company to demand production of its chips at the site. While chips made by TSMC in the U.S. are more expensive than those fabbed in Taiwan, U.S. production may enable MediaTek to address certain customers and/or avoid potential tariffs.</p><p>Word of MediaTek's intentions comes from the company's Corporate Vice President JC Hsu, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/taiwan-s-mediatek-in-talks-with-tsmc-to-make-chips-in-arizona">Nikkei</a>. The plans target two specific categories: automotive parts and chips tied to more regulated or strategically sensitive applications. The move is said to comply with demands from American clients who favor domestic production for logistical and policy-related reasons. Hsu stressed that the deal has not been formally inked yet.</p><p>Unfortunately, the high-ranking executive of MediaTek never revealed when the company plans to produce chips at TSMC's Fab in Arizona or which process technology it intends to use. To that end, it is unclear what exactly MediaTek plans to make. Perhaps the company is ensuring that it can place orders with TSMC U.S. in case it has clients that demand production in America, or there is insufficient capacity in Taiwan. Apparently, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-amd-and-mediatek-reportedly-among-tsmcs-2nm-early-adopters-company-said-to-have-15-customers-lined-up-for-new-process-tech">over a dozen companies interested in making chips on TSMC's N2</a> fabrication process, so it might be crucial for a big company like MediaTek to secure a portion <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmc-to-build-30-percent-of-its-2nm-and-more-advanced-chips-in-the-u-s-to-speed-up-fab-21-build-out">of TSMC's N2-capable capacity that is set to be located in the USA</a>.</p><p>However, whether MediaTek can produce automotive-grade chips at TSMC's Arizona fab (Fab 21) depends on multiple factors — the most critical of which is whether TSMC Fab 21 is compliant with the automotive quality management standard IATF 16949, or at least capable of supporting customers that are. As of now, TSMC Arizona has not publicly disclosed IATF 16949 certification, and the fab was initially focused on consumer and AI/HPC processors using N5 and N4 processes. Without formal IATF 16949 compliance — or documented automotive-qualified production flow — it would be difficult for MediaTek or any other chip designer to use this fab for safety-critical automotive products, especially for applications requiring AEC-Q100 qualified components.</p><p>While MediaTek itself does not necessarily need to be IATF 16949 certified, it must ensure that all entities in its supply chain — including process technology, foundry, OSAT, and others — meet the necessary automotive quality and traceability requirements. TSMC offers N5A, N4A, and N3A process technologies that are tailored for automotive applications, so they may include relaxed rules to boost yield and reliability, and production on these nodes usually involves tighter SPC (statistical process control) and defect detection. However, we do not know whether Fab 21 supports such flows.</p><p>That said, unless TSMC Arizona eventually adopts or mirrors the automotive-grade flows of the foundry's Taiwan fabs, it is unlikely that MediaTek could produce fully automotive-qualified silicon there for anything other than non-safety-critical infotainment or connectivity chips. For advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), powertrain, or battery management chips that require ISO 26262 and ASIL certifications, MediaTek would either need to wait for TSMC Arizona to offer certified flows or continue to rely on TSMC's mature automotive fabs in Taiwan.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia and OpenAI forge $100 billion alliance to deliver 10 gigawatts of Nvidia hardware for AI datacenters ]]>
<p>Tech industry giants OpenAI and Nvidia <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/">have announced</a> a pivotal partnership, which will deploy 10 gigawatts worth of AI datacenters and $100 billion in investments.</p><p>OpenAI has committed to creating multiple datacenters with Nvidia as its "preferred strategic compute and networking partner," with the first one expected to deploy in the second half of 2026. The partnership will see OpenAI construct fervently until the total combined power budget of those datacenters reaches "at least" 10 gigawatts. For its part, Nvidia dove into its war chest to secure $100 billion, returning the favor by progressively investing in OpenAI, presumably via share purchases.</p><p>Additionally, and perhaps most interestingly, both companies commit to "co-optimize" their respective roadmaps. It's not hard to imagine that the hands of Nvidia's AI clients already guide the chipmaker's designs, but this statement could imply that OpenAI will have a bigger say in Nvidia's plans than before.</p><p>The companies also point out that the new collaboration dovetails nicely with the existing agreements with the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank. OpenAI is already the exclusive AI partner for Microsoft, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-announces-worlds-most-powerful-ai-data-center-315-acre-site-to-house-hundreds-of-thousands-of-nvidia-gpus-and-enough-fiber-to-circle-the-earth-4-5-times">promised in January</a> to invest $80 billion in the technology.</p><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI's Sam Altman remarks that "compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future", a statement that would seem more like hyperbole a mere two or three years ago.</p><p>OpenAI's next datacenters will use Nvidia's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-announces-rubin-gpus-in-2026-rubin-ultra-in-2027-feynam-after">Vera Rubin platform</a> (and presumably Rubin Ultra), powerful accelerators packing 76 TB of HBM4 memory that should be capable of performing FP4 inference at 3.6 exaflops and FP8 training at 1.2 exaflops. The fact that the "exa" prefix is becoming commonplace is exciting and scary in equal measures.</p><p>The Rubin GPU and Vera CPUs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-rubin-gpu-and-vera-cpu-data-center-ai-platforms-begin-tape-out-both-chips-in-fab-and-on-track-for-2026">taped out</a> in late August and are now being manufactured in TSMC facilities. Meanwhile, Rubin Ultra is expected to deliver 15 exaflops of FP4 operations for inference, and 5 exaflops of FP4 for training. These figures come by way of 365 TB of HBM4e memory and 14 GB300 GPUs.</p><p>To put the 10-gigawatt figure into perspective, a contemporary U.S. nuclear power plant reactor is suitable for around 1 gigawatt, meaning these new datacenters will gobble up 10 reactors' worth of juice to do their thing. That's a concept that's hard to wrap one's head around. While the technological advancement is definitely impressive, it also raises hard questions about its environmental costs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>TSMC has landed orders from approximately 15 customers to make chips on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-2nm-n2-process-node-enters-production-this-year-a16-and-n2p-arriving-next-year">N2 (2nm-class) manufacturing process</a>, according to a claim made by a high-ranking executive from KLA, a major wafer fab equipment (WFE) maker. The majority of clients to use TSMC's 2nm-class production node are developers of processors for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which, in TSMC's definition, spans from PCs to game consoles and data centers.</p><p>"The N2 node has 15 or so customers doing designs," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.kla.com/news-events/ir-calendar/event/goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025">said</a> Ahmad Khan, President of KLA's combined product and customer organization, Semiconductor Products and Customers, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2025. "At N2, you have got 10-ish high-performance compute customers doing designs.

However, TSMC has never disclosed the actual number of customers. Instead, the company traditionally focuses on the relative number of designs.</p><p>While the President of KLA's Semiconductor Products and Customers division only mentions N2, he likely refers to the whole family of N2-branded fabrication technologies — including N2, N2P, and N2X manufacturing processes — which will ramp over the next few years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It adopted N5 two years before AMD and Nvidia, and began utilizing N3B over a year before Intel. This is not the case with N2, as multiple companies have either confirmed their N2 tape-outs already or are rumored to have reached this milestone.</p><p>Apple will almost certainly remain TSMC's alpha customer for N2 with its next-generation A19/A19 Pro application processors for smartphones and tablets, its 2026 M-series SoCs for Macs, and upcoming modem chips.

On the other hand, Intel disclosed that some of its codenamed Nova Lake processors, due to be released next year, will rely on a foundry node, which is rumored to be N2. Broadcom and Qualcomm will almost certainly jump on the N2 bandwagon rather sooner than later, as advantages offered by the technology — enabled by gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, revamped power delivery, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-2nm-nodes-get-nanoflex-n2p-loses-backside-power-delivery">NanoFlex</a> — both for data center and mobile processors are too appealing to ignore.</p><p>The increased number of clients and designs for the N2 fabrication process in the first year are two reasons why TSMC is going to ramp up three N2-capable fabs over the next several quarters in Taiwan and is speeding up building N2-capable Fab 21 module 3 in Arizona.</p><p>We have reached out to TSMC to confirm the number of N2 clients, but the company has yet to respond.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ FSR 4 modded to run on RDNA 2 GPUs improves image quality by "leaps and bounds," but carries 10% performance penalty —AMD's leaked source code turns into modding frenzy ]]>
<p>Last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-accidentally-marks-fsr-4-open-source-source-code-reveals-potential-support-for-older-radeon-gpus" target="_blank">AMD accidentally made FSR 4 open-source</a> by publishing the entire source code on GitHub, as part of its FidelitySDK. That pushed modders to quickly reverse-engineer how to run FSR 4 on previously incompatible hardware, but the hacks were limited to Linux. That changed just last week when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nhkkr8/fsr_sdk_leak_contained_fsr_4_files_that_work_on/" target="_blank">u/AthleteDependent926 on Reddit </a>figured out how to make it work on Windows — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/latest-fsr-4-source-code-leak-lets-you-run-amds-ai-upscaling-tech-on-nearly-any-gpu-no-linux-required" target="_blank">we saw a 12-20% decrease in potential performance with it</a>, and today new findings on older RDNA GPUs corroborate our testing.</p><p>There are actually three aspects to this story: first, we have an RX 6800 XT that showed a noticeable uptick in visual fidelity at the cost of FPS; secondly, Computer Base tested a bunch of GPUs that saw similar declines in performance; lastly, a Reddit user also tried FSR 4 on their RX 6950 XT and praised its image quality while noting fewer frames achived compared to XeSS. The focal point of the story, though, is the large overhead FSR 4 brings with it, even if it offers a much better-looking image than its predecessor.</p><p>User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chiphell.com/forum.php?extra=page%3D1&mobile=no&mod=viewthread&tid=2744798&utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">kkrace on Chiphell</a> managed to get FSR 4 running on an RX 6800 XT, which is an RDNA 2 graphics card that lacks the proper hardware needed for FSR 4. As such, they saw only 100-107 FPS in <em>Stellar Blade</em> when using FSR 4, compared to 110+ FPS on FSR 3. Even though that's only a ~3-10% decrease, the user claims they saw 10-20% worse frame rates; however, the image quality was significantly better. Therefore, they suggest switching to FSR 4 regardless, because, at triple-digit FPS, you might as well take the slight performance hit for majorly upgraded visuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

They tested it using their RX 6950 XT and, while no comparison numbers with FSR 3 were provided, the RX 6950 XT still gained about 10% more frames with FSR 4 when tallied against native (TAA) results. Intel's XeSS, on the other hand, had even better performance, but the user highlighted that it was unstable and not as good-looking.</p><p>These sentiments are echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/anleitung-fsr-4-auf-radeon-rx-7000-rdna-3.94373/" target="_blank">Computer Base's testing,</a> which didn't use an RDNA 2 GPU. Rather, they pitted an RX 7900 XTX against an RX 9070 XT — AMD's latest flagship purpose-built with FSR 4 in mind. Surprisingly, it still underperformed compared to FSR 3. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, tested at 4K Ultra settings, the 9070 XT netted 77 FPS using FSR 3.1 and only 74 FPS using FSR 4. More importantly, though, the RDNA 3-based 7900 XTX saw 16% fewer frames in FSR 4 compared to FSR 3.1, but again justified that with markedly better visuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Modders were able to tweak FSR 4 to run INT8 libraries, which themselves have a noticeable discrepancy between each other. FP8 support is only available on RDNA 4, similar to how RDNA 2 GPUs need to fall back on slower instructions like DP4a to run FSR 4 (which explains the missing FPS).</p><p>It's important to note that AMD is also working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-fsr-3-1-4-update-lays-a-redstone-foundation-new-version-improves-image-quality-eases-future-developer-integrations">FSR Redstone</a> as we speak; it's the company's next-gen upscaler designed to work on a myriad of GPUs, including non-AMD ones, which is perhaps why the Red Team hasn't extended FSR 4 support beyond the RX 9000 series yet.

FSR 4 is supposed to only work on RX 9000 series GPUs, but modders were quick to figure out how to run it on older RDNA graphics cards when AMD accidentally published the entire source code on GitHub.

<![CDATA[ Samsung earns Nvidia certification for its HBM3 memory — stock jumps 5% as company finally catches up to SK hynix and Micron in HBM3E production ]]>
<p>Samsung's 12-layer HBM3E chips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202509190008">have passed</a> Nvidia's qualification tests for use in high-end AI accelerators. The Korean giant's stock price immediately jumped over 5% following the news, as the certification means Samsung is catching up to SK hynix and Micron, both of which were already selling HBM3E chips to Nvidia.</p><p>The welcome development comes around 18 months after HBM3E's development was complete, and after multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/samsung-hbm3e-chips-reportedly-fail-to-meet-nvidias-heat-and-power-requirements">certification delays</a>. Samsung reportedly won't be selling HBM3E to Nvidia in high quantities until 2026, as current orders for the speedy chips are being fulfilled by SK hynix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/micron-puts-stackable-24gb-hbm3e-chips-into-volume-production-for-nvidias-next-gen-h200-ai-gpu">and Micron</a>.</p><p>According to the report, Samsung's HBM3 memory is expected to go into Nvidia DGX B300 cards in fairly short order, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/samsung-shares-rise-to-year-s-high-on-nvidia-quality-test-report" target="_blank">Bloomberg's industry sources expect</a> the chips will get the final Nvidia certification quite soon. As for AMD, Samsung was already selling HBM3E chips for Instinct MI350 cards, alongside Micron. HBM3 is currently the top grade of memory chips available, comprising 12 layers, up from eight in standard HBM3. This configuration results in a meaty 1.2 TB/s per stack.</p><p>While HBM3E isn't even one year old, the AI train waits for no man. All sights are already set on HBM4, a spec that doubles the chips' bus width, resulting in approximately 2 TB/s of bandwidth per stack. It's worth noting that while the JEDEC HBM4 spec asks for 8 Gbps per pin, all three major memory makers are aiming for 10 to 11 GBps per pin on production chips, reportedly due to pressure from Nvidia. Thanks to manufacturing on 3-4 nm processes (down from 10 nm), HBM4 is predicted to offer significantly higher capacity of 64 GB per chip (up from 48 GB), along with a 20 to 30% reduction in power consumption.</p><p>Samsung has been in talks with almost every AI chip maker to get an early certification for its upcoming HBM4 wares, intending to fire up volume production as soon as the first half of 2026. This particular race is currently led by SK hynix, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/sk-hynix-completes-development-of-hbm4-2-048-bit-interface-and-10-gt-s-speeds-promised">which signaled the completion</a> of its HBM4 development not even two weeks ago. Judging by Samsung's stock price jump, though, it seems investors are quite confident that the Korean maker will catch up soon enough.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

ASML itself has admitted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asml-china-worker-stole-info-about-chipmaking-tools">a China-based employee stole proprietary EUV data</a>, highlighting how valuable the technology has become.</p><p>The policy has pushed chip procurement into murky territory. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/why-nobody-is-buying-nvidia-6000d-in-china">Grey-market Nvidia GPUs</a> continue to flood in through Hong Kong and Singapore despite being explicitly banned, with seizures measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But smuggling a workstation card is one thing; sneaking in a 180-ton lithography scanner is another.

Using 193nm argon-fluoride lasers, immersion DUV systems comfortably support 28nm nodes, with yields and costs increasing dramatically as nodes shrink further. With multi-patterning (exposing the same wafer multiple times with different masks) they can be stretched down to 7nm-class geometries. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-10nm-earnings-amd,36967.html">Intel’s disastrous 10nm rollout</a> proved how costly and yield-sensitive that approach can be, but it remains the only path available to Chinese fabs.</p><p>SMIC’s Kirin 9000-class parts, built for Huawei, already demonstrate the limits of this strategy. It’s widely believed that they were fabricated with DUV and heavy use of multiple patterning. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/chipsets/huaweis-sanctions-evading-kirin-9000s-tested-significantly-behind-kirin-9000-with-tsmc-tech">The chips work</a>, but at lower volume and efficiency than anything coming out of Taiwan or South Korea.</p><p>For now, Chinese fabs are leaning on their existing ASML DUV fleets. Nearly half of ASML’s second-quarter equipment tooling shipments in 2024 went to China, despite the political pressure in Washington. Those sales are a reminder of just how dependent Beijing still is on imported tools. But the window is closing, and the focus is shifting.</p><p>Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment announced in 2023 that it had built a 28nm immersion scanner, the SSA800-10W. It’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinas-first-28nm-capable-scanner-to-be-delivered-by-end-of-2023">crude compared to ASML’s Twinscan line</a>, but it represents the first domestically developed immersion tool, and critically, it was designed without U.S. intellectual property. According to a <em>TrendForce </em>report, SMIC is testing a prototype from Yuliangsheng, a Huawei-linked affiliate of SiCarrier, which also rated for 28nm, but with ambitions to scale toward 7nm with multi-patterning.</p><p>A fully domestic DUV scanner, even if mired in yield problems, would insulate Chinese foundries from future Western policy decisions. Let’s not forget that China has previously made it clear that strategic self-sufficiency matters more than perfect parity with TSMC or Samsung.</p><h2 id="china-is-playing-the-long-game-2">China is playing the long game</h2><p>Nobody expects China’s DUV tools to rival ASML’s. The gap is at least a decade, and without EUV, the economics are punishing. Multi-patterning consumes more wafers, introduces more points of failure, and demands ever more sophisticated etch and metrology equipment to hold yields together. Every advanced chip that comes off a DUV line in Shanghai costs more than its equivalent in Hsinchu.</p><p>Even with low yields, however, a 7nm-class domestic chip is better than none at all. Huawei has already rebuilt much of its smartphone supply chain around local vendors, and state mandates now require Chinese firms to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/china-mandates-domestic-firms-source-50-percent-of-chips-from-chinese-producers-beijing-continues-to-squeeze-companies-over-reliance-on-foreign-semiconductors">source 50% of their chips domestically</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, ASML’s chief executive has said China is ten to fifteen years behind. That may be true in technology, but sanctions are accelerating the drive to close the gap. Each ban entrenches the incentive to localize, and each domestic stepper tested at SMIC or Huawei’s labs makes the next round of controls less decisive.</p><p>That is the paradox of the so-called semiconductor cold war. EUV has been locked down, but in the process, DUV has become the backbone of a new, homegrown ecosystem. For Washington, the risk is that every workaround makes China a little less dependent. And for China, the bet is that a decade of inefficiency is worth the price of eventual independence.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

U.S. pressure has cut China off from ASML’s EUV tools, forcing SMIC and peers to stretch DUV and build local scanners. It may be costly now, but it could be key to the country's road to self-reliance in semiconductor manufacturing.

Though the ordinance will cover all citizens of Toyoaki, there is certainly a sense that this is a ‘tool’ with which to coerce school children into reducing their free time screen time.</p><p>“Toyoaki City says that smartphones are essential for daily life, but prolonged use may affect the home environment, such as lack of sleep, and may hinder the healthy growth of children,” reports NHK. Children of school age should follow additional advice to put down their devices by 9 pm if at elementary school or younger, and by 10 pm if a junior high school student or above.</p><h2 id="arguments-for-and-against-the-ordinance-2">Arguments for and against the ordinance</h2><p>As we noted in the intro, the ordinance didn’t pass without some dissent. Naysayers on the council put forward several arguments against the proposed two-hour free time rule. One said that smartphone usage should be "determined in the context of family discipline." Another indicated that some children find important refuge from school and home life on their smartphones.</p><p>However, the majority who voted to pass the ordinance today insisted that it will help prevent device addiction. Moreover, citizens should think of it as “a gentle proposal for citizens to reconsider their lives and child-rearing,” and that is its value. Indeed, it is worth repeating, the new rule is non-binding and without penalty – and thus much more like official guidance or advice.</p><p>In a speech to the press, Mayor Toyoaki echoed this advisory sentiment, underlining that the two hours “is just a guideline.” He mused that it would be useful if citizens checked themselves for health and sleep benefits after making changes to their leisure time smartphone habits.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Twitch streamer raising money for cancer treatment has funds stolen by malware-ridden Steam game — BlockBlasters title stole $150,000 from hundreds of players ]]>
<p>It has been 0 days since the Steam marketplace has been used to deliver malware to unsuspecting gamers who download titles from Valve's long-running platform.</p><p>Twitch streamer Raivo "RastalandTV" Plavnieks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969629808788181258" target="_blank">said</a> on Sept. 30 that over $32,000 worth of cryptocurrency—which had been donated to him to help pay for cancer treatments—was stolen after he installed a Steam game called "BlockBlasters" when someone in his stream chat recommended it to him.</p><p>"BlockBlasters" debuted on Steam in July and was malware-free until an August 30 update that, according to the independent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://steamdb.info/depot/3872351/history/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracker of all things Steam, added the crypto- and credential-stealing malware. That means the game was actively being used to deliver malware for nearly a month before the RastalandTV hack.</p><p><em>BleepingComputer </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/verified-steam-game-steals-streamers-cancer-treatment-donations/" target="_blank">reports</a> that RastalandTV's live hacking prompted security researchers to investigate the game. "ZachXBT" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1969793042531107300" target="_blank">said</a> that more than $150,000 had been stolen from 261 different Steam accounts; the "vx-underground" malware research group said it found evidence that the actual victim count was 478.</p><p>Another group of security researchers have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vI4uKIYLl5iw6k1gspG4KY1JOoMIBGC1B6drPHmIZic/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank">published</a> their breakdown of how the malware worked, how they identified the cybercriminals responsible for the operation, and how they disrupted it. (They also included a note to law enforcement saying they have "mountains of technical evidence surrounding individuals in this case" to share.)</p><p>Some of the discussion around this incident has focused on the claim that "BlockBlasters" was marked as "Verified" on Steam. To our knowledge, the only "Verified" label applied to games relates to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified" target="_blank">their compatibility with</a> the Steam Deck, which simply means that Valve has confirmed the title will run on the handheld. That doesn't necessarily imply that Valve has assessed the game's contents.</p><p>But that in no way negates the fact that Steam, a platform that millions of gamers have come to trust over several decades of operation, delivered malware used to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency for nearly a month. It took a high-profile, live-streamed incident for something to be done about this operation.</p><p>"This is appalling levels of vetting," the researchers who investigated this incident said. "How can you let such brazen malware exist on your platform?"</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ $37 billion 'Stargate of China' project takes shape — country is converting farmland into data centers to centralize AI compute power ]]>
<p>Deep in the Yangtze River basin, one of China’s most prosperous economic regions, the country is betting big on rice fields scattered across a 760-acre island, located in the municipality of Wuhu. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/31b8d6d8-adb0-4db0-a292-422c5a3bff19" target="_blank">According to the Financial Times</a>, this agricultural land will soon host some of Beijing's biggest servers dedicated to serving wealthy areas nearby, which will represent one part of the plan to build the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/open-ai-oracle-and-softbank-to-invest-usd500-billion-in-stargate-ai-project">Stargate of China</a>," as described by an executive tied to one of the project's suppliers.</p><p>Currently, China only accounts for about 15% of the global AI compute power, far less than the ~75% held by the United States, according to a study by Epoch AI. In an effort to better compete with America, China is taking a different, measured approach that will see it consolidating already-existing but dispersed data centers into one unified network... to be linked together using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-to-open-source-its-ub-mesh-data-center-scale-interconnect-soon-details-technical-aspects-one-interconnect-to-rule-them-all-is-designed-to-replace-everything-from-pcie-to-tcp-ip" target="_blank">Huawei's UB-Mesh tech</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the aforementioned farmland will be converted into a "data island" housing massive data centers for four companies: Huawei, China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. These servers are strategically placed near major cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing — all of which will benefit from this upgrade, whose goal is to speed up inference for people living in the area. Think faster responses in agentic AI applications, for instance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

China has designated Ulanqab in Inner Mongolia to supply Beijing and Tianjin, Guizhou in the south to feed Guangzhou, and Qingyang in Gansu to serve Chengdu and Chongqing; these new data centers are intentionally in close proximity to large civilian populations, while existing data centers in remote areas are being rewired to focus on training LLMs.</p><p>That narrative further extends to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chinas-ai-data-center-boom-goes-bust-rush-leaves-billions-of-dollars-in-idle-infrastructure" target="_blank">AI chips sitting idle in faraway facilities</a> located in remote but energy-dense provinces.

China is building its own Stargate in the Wuhu region, where an island is being converted from farmland into massive data centers for a bunch of companies. These servers are close to upper-class urban centers on purpose; they will speed up inference in these regions, while China works to link together remote data centers otherwise.

<![CDATA[ Prusa’s mobile slicer now works with competitors' 3D printers — new EasyPrint tool works with Bambu, Creality, and more ]]>
<p>Prusa Research has rolled out a major update to its browser-based slicing tool, EasyPrint, extending support beyond its own 3D printers to include competitors. Prusa Research has always shown support for the 3D printing community as a whole, with its open-source Prusa Slicer being the foundation of many competitors' branded slicers. Prusa’s free computer-based software currently has downloadable profiles for 30 competing brands of 3D printers.</p><p>The update allows users to slice models directly from Printables.com or through the Prusa mobile app, and send print files over a local network. Users can connect any compatible machine by selecting the correct network protocol and entering the printer’s local IP address. Once configured, the process takes just a few clicks to slice, preview, and send a model to print.</p><p>EasyPrint supports 22 brands of consumer-grade 3D printers, like Creality, Bambu, Anycubic, and Ultimaker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.74%;"><img id="VrqdR7775ebk2M7ESarLrm" name="image2" alt="Prusa Slicer Now Works with Competitor's 3D Printers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VrqdR7775ebk2M7ESarLrm.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1031" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The move to support other brands sets EasyPrint apart from competing ecosystems. For example, Creality’s Creality Cloud mobile slicer allows you to pull models from Creality’s library and use a full-feature, cloud-based version of Creality Print. However, you are limited to Creality printers that you have bound to your account. Bambu Lab’s Bambu Handy app and website rely on pre-sliced user-uploaded G-code and can only be sent to Bambu Lab printers tied to your account.</p><p>Prusa Research is making 3D printing more accessible to the masses, even as more people rely on mobile devices as their primary computer. Though you still need to be tech-savvy to set up the connection between EasyPrint and your 3D printer, being able to select, slice, and send files from your couch has its appeal.</p><p>Originally launched as an invite-only pilot, EasyPrint was introduced as a simplified online version of PrusaSlicer that works on PCs, phones, and tablets. It offers access to official machine and filament profiles, plus basic controls such as scaling, adding multiples, infill density, and automatic supports. Selecting wall thickness and speeds is simplified to selecting a “profile” that Prusa fans will recognize from the original slicer, such as fast detail, structural, and speed.</p><p>Josef Prusa has previously emphasized his desire for EasyPrint to remain accessible across the 3D printing ecosystem. “Printables are meant to be for everyone. We do not want to make any walled garden. Actually, quite the opposite—we want 3D printing to be easier for everyone,” he wrote in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.prusa3d.com/prusa_easy_print_on_phone_tablet_110894/"><u>earlier blog post</u></a>.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ The future of DRAM: From DDR5 advancements to future ICs
]]>
<p>When the DDR5 specification was introduced in 2020, one of the things that impressed us was the headroom left for further development of the technology, both in terms of performance and in terms of per-device capacity. You can revisit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/market-research-predictions-ddr5-gddr6x-lpddr5-lpddr5">our 2020 thoughts on DDR5</a> for a quick refresher.</p><p>Five years later, DDR5 has still not achieved everything that was specified in the original JEDEC document. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/jedec-new-standards-will-double-ddr5-bandwidth-enable-faster-memory-for-laptops">In 2024</a>, the organization further enhanced performance capabilities and even added an anti-rowhammer feature to the spec. But what do these changes in headroom and extensions mean for enthusiasts?</p><p>Before we proceed with the evolution of DDR5, let's debunk a rumor about DDR6 arriving in the next couple of years, because it is not.</p><p>The earliest time that you can expect DDR6 to arrive on consumer platforms is late 2029, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. It remains to be seen when DDR6 arrives on data center platforms, but typically, this segment adopts new-generation memory technologies later than their consumer counterparts. Of course, there are bandwidth-hungry AI applications, but they will likely be fine with the bandwidth-boosting MRDIMM tech for a while. So, with that said, DDR5 is here to stay, albeit coming in different forms than we're used to today.</p><h2 id="new-process-technologies-enable-new-breakthroughs-2">New process technologies enable new breakthroughs</h2><p>Just like logic chips, to improve the performance, power, and area (PPA) of new DRAM device, memory makers need to utilize new process technologies. Virtually all major steps in performance, capacity, and costs of DRAM are driven by new process nodes. For example, Samsung's 14nm (D1α) DRAM technology, featuring up to five EUV layers, enabled the company to build the world's first 24 Gb DDR5-7200 memory device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/samsung-develops-24gb-ddr5-drams-768gb-modules-enroute">in late 2021,</a> ahead of the industry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Now, Micron and SK hynix have introduced (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/micron-unveils-ddr5-9200-memory-1g-process-technology-with-euv">1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.skhynix.com/sk-hynix-develops-industry-first-1c-ddr5/">2</a>) their 6<sup>th</sup> Generation 10nm-class process technologies — the so-called 1γ (1-gamma) or 1c nodes,
and have even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-ships-worlds-first-1g-1-gamma-based-lpddr5x-enabling-rich">begun shipping</a> actual products based on this node.</p><p>By contrast, Samsung seems to be a little behind with its 1γ/1c process, which will have an impact on its actual product roadmap. However, keep in mind that Samsung's D1β (5<sup>th</sup> Gen 10nm-class) has a feature size of 12.5nm, which is smaller than its closest competitors. Micron's G5 10nm node sports a 13nm feature size, whereas SK hynix's 5<sup>th</sup> Gen 10nm-class node offers a feature size of 12.65nm, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://library.techinsights.com/public/sectioned-blog-viewer/a0e24d07-f721-4346-a58c-73786f397dbd" target="_blank"><em>TechInsights</em></a>.</p><p>The 1γ/1c process technology is an important node for all DRAM makers, as it's primed for use in the creation of high-capacity, high-performance DDR5 DRAM, as well as HBM4, GDDR7, and LPDDR5X memory devices.</p><p>However, the next-generation 1δ/1d production node will likely be even more important, as it will be the last 10nm-class node that will rely on the 6F2 cell design, which has been used for over a decade.</p><p>It's anticipated that the new 4F2 cell structure for sub-10nm nodes will replace 6F2. The 1δ/1d process technologies are also expected to be introduced in the second half of 2026, though their ramp times remain to be seen. But, this is anticipated to be a real DRAM breakthrough, which will come to market toward the end of the decade, alongside the sub-10nm manufacturing processes.</p><p>The first sub-10nm production nodes are expected to arrive in late 2027 – 2028 at the earliest, with Samsung potentially leaping ahead of its rivals, according to <em>TechInsights</em>.</p><h2 id="ddr5-10-000-modules-are-around-the-corner-ddr5-10-700-are-next-2">DDR5-10,000 modules are around the corner, DDR5-10,700 are next</h2><p>In 2024, JEDEC released an updated version of its JESC79-JC5 specification, which defines DDR5 technology, and it officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21363/jedec-extends-ddr5-specification-to-8800-mts-adds-anti-rowhammer-features">extends DDR5 support to 8800 MT/s</a>, as well as adding features like improved I/O training through Self-Refresh Exit Clock Sync.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The spec also defines the timings of CL62 for premium chips and CL78 for lower-grade ones, maintaining an absolute latency around 14ns despite higher CAS latency.</p><p>Traditionally, JEDEC specifications are extremely conservative, so Micron envisions that its DDR5 DRAMs made using its 1γ/1c fabrication process will hit data transfer rates of up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/micron-unveils-ddr5-9200-memory-1g-process-technology-with-euv">to 9200 MT/s</a>. SK hynix is also prepping 9200 MT/s memory devices with capacities up to 32 Gb, thus bringing together performance and capacity. However, speed bins beyond 9200 MT/s are not officially listed by anyone, to our knowledge.</p><p>Such DDR5-9200 32 Gb ICs are projected to hit the market relatively soon, then leading makers of enthusiast-grade memory modules will extract additional performance from such devices. You should expect high-performance 32 GB modules from the usual suspects — think Corsair, G.Skill, and V-Color — to hit 9600 MT/s on higher-end motherboards.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The CKD regenerates the clock signal, which drives the actual memory chips, ensuring signal integrity and thus achieving stability and reliability at high data transfer rates.</p><p>For now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/corsair-vengeance-rgb-cudimm-ddr5-8400-c40-2x24gb-review">CUDIMMs</a> are only officially supported by Intel platforms. However, AMD is expected to introduce CUDIMM and then CSODIMM (SODIMM with a CKD) support sometime in 2026, likely beginning with Granite Ridge Refresh with speeds up to 10,000 MT/s, and then extending to next-generation CPUs based on the Zen 6 microarchitecture (e.g., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amds-next-generation-zen-6-medusa-point-apus-could-feature-as-many-as-22-cores">Medusa Point</a>) with speeds up to 10,700 MT/s or higher. Keep in mind that the information is strictly unofficial at this point.</p><p>However, even before the CUDIMM support arrives, AMD plans to offer an enhancement that will enable high data transfer rates and low latencies on its consumer platforms, according to sources familiar with the topic. For now, the company is considering targets in the range of DDR5-6400 at CL26, which will reduce absolute latency to 8ns —a feat unprecedented even for enthusiast-grade DDR5.</p><h2 id="32-gb-48-gb-and-64-gb-ddr5-ics-2">32 Gb, 48 Gb, and 64 Gb DDR5 ICs</h2><p>As we noted earlier in this article, new production technologies enable DRAM makers not only to boost performance or lower power consumption of their chips, but also to increase the capacity of their memory ICs.

With 1β/1b and 1γ/1c production nodes, we're looking at 32 Gb DDR5 ICs, which let memory module makers build unbuffered DIMMs and CUDIMMs with 64 GB, 128 GB (Micron is currently offering DDR5-8000 RDIMMs, for example), or even 256 GB capacities.</p><p>Currently, there are no confirmed plans for 48Gb or 64Gb DDR5 ICs with a definitive launch window, which suggests that they are still in the early planning stages. However, according to <em>TechInsights</em>, memory makers are seeking to achieve 48 Gb ICs, based on 1δ/1d process technologies sometime in 2027 – 2028.</p><p>As for 64 Gb DDR5 devices — the apex of DDR5 development — they will likely be reserved primarily for high-capacity data center-grade applications arriving from 2030 and onwards.

<![CDATA[ Why packaging is a huge part of Nvidia's $5B Intel deal — Foveros could speed up market delivery ]]>
<p>Intel isn’t the most obvious partner for Nvidia. The two companies have competed across consumer, data center, and AI markets for decades with no shortage of friction. But on a joint call on September 18, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">following news of an unexpected partnership</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel chairman Lip-Bu Tan turned that dynamic on its head, announcing that Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel and begin using its packaging technology for an upcoming SoC line.</p><p>Why? Not for foundry capacity in the traditional sense, and not just to keep a geopolitical hedge against Taiwan. According to Huang, the key factor was packaging. “Intel has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-opens-dollar35-billion-advanced-foveros-3d-chip-packaging-facility-in-new-mexico">Foveros multi-technology packaging capability,</a>” he said, “and it’s really enabling here… connecting NVIDIA's GPU die chiplet with Intel's CPUs in a multi-technology packaging capability and multiprocess packaging technology.”</p><p>Tan agreed. “Foveros and EMIB is [<em>sic</em>] a really good technology,” he added, calling the packaging roadmap “a great opportunity for both of us.” In recent years, packaging has become Intel’s fastest and most reliable on-ramp to foundry revenue. For Nvidia, that makes it the shortest path to market for its next-generation AI SoCs and the likely primary driver behind the partnership.</p><h2 id="why-the-attraction-to-intel-s-packaging-2">Why the attraction to Intel’s packaging?</h2><p>The packaging that Huang praised by name — Foveros — is Intel’s 3D chip stacking solution. Unlike traditional multi-die packages, which spread chiplets side-by-side on a shared substrate, Foveros stacks one directly on top of another using through-silicon vias (TSVs). This shortens interconnect length and offers significantly higher bandwidth than planar layouts. It also allows each tile in the stack to be built on a different process node, enabling designers to assign logic to the most appropriate tech for performance or cost.</p><p>If Foveros is the vertical axis of Intel’s packaging portfolio, EMIB (Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge) is the horizontal one. EMIB embeds thin silicon bridges inside the package substrate to link dies together at a high density and low power without the need for a massive silicon interposer. More recently, Intel has combined the two in what it calls Co-EMIB: Foveros stacks linked together across a package using EMIB bridges.</p><p>What this all adds up to is a system for building complex chiplet-based products that behave more like monolithic SoCs, and Intel has spent the better part of a decade turning it into a viable business. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intels-ponte-vecchio-smiles-for-the-camera">Intel's Ponte Vecchio GPU</a> used Foveros and EMIB. So did Meteor Lake. And crucially, Intel has been manufacturing these packages at volume.

During its Direct Connect event back in April, the company highlighted packaging alongside manufacturing capacity and ecosystem development as core to its customer-first push, emphasizing how Foveros and EMIB allow Intel Foundry to serve heterogeneous compute needs without requiring customers to wait on new process nodes.</p><p>We described <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-details-new-advanced-packaging-breakthroughs-emib-t-paves-the-way-for-hbm4-and-increased-ucie-bandwidth">Intel's packaging breakthroughs</a> earlier this year as “the fastest on-ramp to meaningful revenue generation,” particularly when compared to the long ramp cycles associated with new front-end process technologies.</p><p>This framing was echoed by Huang during the joint call. “In the case of our consumer PC, we will sell… Nvidia’s GPU chiplet… to Intel,” he said, adding, “And that is then packaged into an SoC.” That chiplet will be bonded using Foveros or Co-EMIB and then shipped as part of a complete product.</p><p>In other words, Nvidia gets to leverage Intel’s infrastructure and packaging stack without waiting for its core foundry nodes to catch up. That might be the entire point. Nvidia’s highest-volume AI parts now use chiplet designs with extreme interconnect and bandwidth demands. Intel’s packaging lets Nvidia skip the wait by integrating existing GPU dies with new CPU tiles — a point Huang hammered home repeatedly. “... It’s really a fabulous way of mixing and matching technology… that's… why we're going to be able to innovate so quickly and build these incredibly complex systems,” he said.</p><p>Tan echoed the sentiment. “I think it’s a great opportunity for both of us,” he said. “...

With U.S. demand for AI systems surging, Nvidia needs a second-source capacity that isn’t located entirely in Taiwan. Intel provides that, with domestic packaging and a fast-maturing foundry model built around chiplet assembly.</p><p>But geography aside, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/teams-at-nvidia-and-intel-have-been-working-in-secret-on-jointly-developed-processors-for-a-year-the-trump-administration-has-no-involvement-in-this-partnership-at-all">partnership</a> is ultimately about what Intel’s packaging lets Nvidia do that no one else can deliver on the same timeline: Build hybrid, multi-chiplet SoCs with custom CPUs, GPU dies from another fab, and ultra-high-bandwidth interconnect between them. That’s not a TSMC job, nor is it a Samsung one. It’s exactly the kind of complex system Intel’s packaging team has been preparing for years, and now it has Nvidia as its highest-profile customer.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Microsoft’s pivotal Windows NT 3.5 release made it a serious contender, 31 years ago today ]]>
<p>The Windows 11 you use today is still identified as "Windows NT" in some ways, and that's because its lineage extends all the way back to the venerable Windows NT. Version 3.5 is widely considered the most pivotal release for the "New Technology" version of Windows, so today we cast a glance back at Windows' forebears, as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.5" target="_blank">31 years ago today</a> that Windows NT 3.5 released to the public.</p><p>When Microsoft first announced NT, it wasn't aimed at the family PC. NT was built for the enterprise, where Novell NetWare ruled networking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/hp-z400-workstation,2718.html" target="_blank">UNIX workstations</a> were the only type of workstation taken seriously by "serious" computing guys. Windows 3.1, the friendly GUI most people knew, was still fundamentally an MS-DOS front-end, and that means it was for baby computers used by baby users, at least in the minds of workstation guys.</p><p>By contrast, Windows NT was designed as a clean-slate fully-32-bit operating system with a portable kernel, preemptive multitasking, and protected memory. Dave Cutler and his team — many of whom were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/508-mainframe-computer-history-2.html" target="_blank">veterans of DEC's VMS</a> — engineered Windows NT with long-term ambitions that went far beyond Microsoft's popular consumer products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="VLUmwdwcVhqjLRQrqZczpF" name="windows-nt-35-program-manager" alt="A screenshot of the Windows NT 3.5 desktop, showing Program Manager and many application shortcuts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLUmwdwcVhqjLRQrqZczpF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="960" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Windows NT 3.5 still visually resembled Windows 3.1 to the point that you could hardly see any difference. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft Corporation)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The very first version, Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, was more of a proof of concept than a practical OS. Purportedly codenamed "NT OS/2" during development thanks to its roots in Microsoft's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/preview-version-of-microsoft-os2-was-sold-for-dollar650-on-ebay" target="_blank">abortive partnership with IBM</a>, it was notoriously heavy. Minimum specs called for an 80386 with 12MB of RAM to really breathe — at a time when 4MB of RAM was typical and 8MB was luxurious. It was secure, modern, and forward-thinking, but the word most reviewers used was "slow."</p><p>Enter Windows NT 3.5, codenamed "Daytona." It didn't reinvent the OS, but it did the next best thing: it tuned, trimmed, and accelerated it. Microsoft re-engineered large swaths of the networking stack, making file and print sharing significantly faster. Performance optimizations lowered memory demands, and the system became legitimately credible as both a workstation OS and a server, purposes for which it was sold as separate products. Daytona was the release where NT stopped feeling like an experiment and started to feel like a real product.</p><p>Besides performance, networking was the star upgrade. Networking was such a focus of Windows NT that many people have mistakenly thought "NT" stood for "Network Technology." NT 3.5 brought first-class TCP/IP support at a time when the internet was just starting to break into public consciousness. Microsoft bundled utilities like FTP and Telnet clients alongside its revamped TCP/IP stack, allowing NT machines to connect to this strange, rapidly growing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sir-tim-berners-lee-nft" target="_blank">world wide web</a>" with relative ease. Compared to NetWare or early UNIX boxes, NT suddenly looked less like a lumbering curiosity and more like a contender.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2263px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:119.58%;"><img id="h62d6mnMSpdvDvQUhV5WeD" name="dec-alpha-windows-nt-cover-art" alt="The cover art of the Windows NT 3.51 release for DEC's Alpha processors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h62d6mnMSpdvDvQUhV5WeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2263" height="2706" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The cover art of the Windows NT 3.51 release for DEC's Alpha processors. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft Corporation)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another detail often forgotten today: NT wasn't just tied to Intel's x86 world. Microsoft offered NT 3.5 builds for MIPS CPUs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chip-design-legend-jim-keller-aims-for-tenstorrent-wins-in-markets-not-well-served-by-nvidia" target="_blank">DEC's Alpha chips</a>, and even later PowerPC processors, reflecting Cutler's obsession with portability. The kernel was designed around a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), an ambitious idea at the time, meaning that the same codebase could in theory run across architectures. In practice, x86 soon dominated on the strength of Intel's fabrication expertise, but in 1994 the idea of NT as a cross-platform OS wasn't just marketing fluff; it really shipped on those platforms.</p><p>The interface, however, remained old-school. NT 3.5 still looked like Windows 3.1, complete with the classic Program Manager and File Manager. That familiar façade made it easy to use for folks coming from 16-bit Windows, but it also likely slowed adoption among professional users. Windows NT 3.51, launched just nine months after the original 3.5 release, made it much easier to write Windows 95 apps that could also run on NT by adding support for things like the Common Controls library.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

By the time NT 4.0 arrived in 1996 with the Windows 95 shell grafted on top, the direction was clear. NT had won Microsoft's internal civil war against DOS-based Windows. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/739-history-of-microsoft-windows-2.html" target="_blank">Windows 2000</a> proved that an NT-based system could serve both workstation and consumer use cases, and this culminated in 2001's Windows XP, which unified consumer and enterprise under one NT codebase.</p><p>In hindsight, Windows NT 3.5 was a transitional release. It was the moment the "New Technology" started proving its worth. It wasn't flashy, but it mattered, because without Daytona, there's no XP, no Windows 7, no Windows 11 — just a world where Microsoft never quite shook off DOS, and where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/16-inch-macbook-pro-late-2024" target="_blank">we'd all probably be using Macs</a>.</p><p>For an operating system that most people never installed, that's quite the legacy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>SoftBank successfully delivered end-to-end 5G connectivity to standard smartphones using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250918_02" target="_blank"><u>airborne base station</u></a>, in a live field trial conducted in June, above Hachijō Island, Japan. The company used a light aircraft flying at 3,000 meters to simulate a high-altitude platform, linking ground infrastructure to devices via a 26 GHz feeder connection and a 1.7 GHz service link.</p><p>Unlike most “direct-to-device” projects that rely on satellites in low Earth orbit, SoftBank’s approach uses High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) that hover in the stratosphere, about 20 kilometers up. That altitude brings big advantages like lower latency and fewer of the power and Doppler challenges that present challenges to orbital links. According to SoftBank, the service link in the trial operated on the 1.7 GHz band, which is already supported by most 5G phones sold around the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

That design means HAPS nodes can act as intelligent base stations, not just repeaters or relays. The company also validated Doppler correction, automatic power control, and adaptive beam tracking, all of which are required for commercial service in the sky.</p><p>Compared to satellite-to-cell systems like AST SpaceMobile’s LEO-based platform, which previously demonstrated a 5G call from space, HAPS can cover wide areas with lower path loss and better spectrum reuse. And thanks to recent ITU decisions at WRC-23, operators like SoftBank can now deploy HAPS in terrestrial mobile bands, including 700 MHz, 850 MHz, 1.7 GHz, and 2.5 GHz.</p><p>SoftBank’s work could lead to 5G service in places where towers don’t reach, like disaster zones, offshore waters, or remote islands. The company hasn’t said when it will scale this to a full commercial launch, but the technical foundation is here, at least in theory.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><u><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><u><em> add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Notorious software bug was killing people 40 years ago — at least three people died after radiation doses that were 100x too strong from the buggy Therac-25 radiation therapy machine ]]>
<p>Software bugs can cause a lot of anxiety, inconvenience, and leech away valuable time, but thankfully they are rarely fatal. However, back in 1985 a radiation therapy machine called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25</a> was only just getting started on its human killing spree. There was a bug in its software which resulted in a deadly race condition, and at least six unfortunate individuals received doses of radiation that were 100x too strong. Three people died as a result of this software bug.</p><p>When launched, Therac-25 was an attractive machine for medical institutions as it offered a revolutionary dual treatment modes in one compact machine. It could be used for electron beam therapy to address shallow tissue problems, like skin cancers. Its other operating mode was Megavolt X-ray therapy, where a high current electron beam could target deep tissue problems. You wouldn’t want to mix these modes up…</p><h2 id="a-move-to-software-only-controls-2">A move to software-only controls</h2><p>One of the innovations delivered with Therac-25 was the move to software-only controls. Earlier machines had electromechanical hardware interlocks to prevent the kinds of radiation accidents that occurred during the operation of this device. Therac-20, for example, is said to have shared software bugs with Therac-25, but the hardware would block any unsafe operating conditions, even if the software malfunctioned.</p><p>A paper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/THERAC25.html">published</a> by California Public University computer science masters student, Anne Marie Porrello, details the nature of the bug / accident across the six known cases. For this fatal bug to manifest, typically, the Therac-25 operator would mistakenly choose the wrong operating mode and quickly try and correct their error. An experienced operator could edit treatment parameters so fast that the software skipped a safety check due to a ‘race condition’ between the input handler and the radiation beam logic.</p><p>Crucially, the Therac-25 took about 8-seconds to change radiation beam mode, and fast operators could confuse the software with inputs during this time window.</p><div ><table><caption>Therac-25: Radiation Accident Summary, table from Anne Marie Porrello</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Date of the Accident </strong></p></td><td

<![CDATA[ Amazon sends a literal brick to a customer in lieu of the RTX 5080 they ordered — the latest cautionary tale in the line of 'commingling' inventory scams ]]>
<p>The sheer amount of times that people have received everything but the high-end GPU they ordered is frankly too absurd to count at this point. We've already seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/geforce-rtx-4090-newegg-switcheroo">metal blocks being delivered </a>instead of a graphics card, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/aorus-rtx-5090-package-from-amazon-was-allegedly-filled-with-macaroni-rice-and-an-old-obsolete-gpu-its-an-impasta">pasta and rice packaged inside a 5090 box</a>, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-bought-from-amazon-had-the-box-contents-swapped-for-bag-of-suspicious-white-powder-pc-hardware-enthusiast-bamboozled-by-amazon-just-days-after-ordering-a-5090-with-no-gpu-core-finds-salt-instead">5070 Ti that was actually just a bag of salt</a>. In comparison to that, receiving just a bland ol' brick instead of an RTX 5080 seems almost uninspired, but that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nm8ah1/amazon_sent_me_a_brick_instead_of_a_5080/" target="_blank">exactly what happened to u/GlassHistorical5303</a>.</p><p>Our victim (who we'll call Glass for ease) ordered a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 from the firm's official store on Amazon. Unfortunately, what they got was a brick wrapped up in the same anti-static bag that the actual GPU usually comes in. Apart from the obvious implication that someone at the factory might've swapped the card, this actually suggests that a reverse-scam was in effect here. Someone may have gotten the real 5080 they wanted, took it out of the box, replaced it with a brick, and returned it to Amazon who didn't bother to properly check the contents.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"
><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nm8ah1/amazon_sent_me_a_brick_instead_of_a_5080">Amazon sent me a brick instead of a 5080</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace">r/pcmasterrace</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>You might be wondering how a returned package could be thrown in with the new stuff that's supposed to come from PNY’s official store — this is where the issue of "commingling" comes in. That term refers to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.modernretail.co/operations/amazon-to-end-commingling-program-after-years-of-complaints-from-brands-and-sellers/" target="_blank">merging items from different sellers and channels into a single, unified inventory</a> that makes the job super easy for logistics but remains effectively untracked. All the scammer needs to do is match the box’s weight, replacing the 5080 with an identically heavy brick, and the scales tip in their favor (no pun intended).</p><p>In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Either that or, of course, an Amazon worker genuinely saw the opportunity and took the GPU for themselves. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. While we often find the fiasco entertaining — top comment called this GPU-brick the "Foundation Edition" — it's anything but that for the end user who is now just a sitting duck to the whims of customer service.</p><p>Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gkrnqk/newegg_sent_me_a_brick_instead_of_a_gpu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">befell another customer a year ago</a>, when purchasing from Newegg. It's because of growing scams like these that we advise people to stay vigilant, no matter where you're buying from.

<![CDATA[ Commodore 64 Ultimate eclipses 10,000 units sold milestone — rebooted firm gives huge thank you to fans ]]>
<p>The new, reinvigorated Commodore has announced that its maiden product reached a significant milestone. A few hours ago, the official Commodore account on X shared evidence that the Commodore 64 Ultimate had eclipsed the 10,000 units sold milestone. The statement also offered profuse thanks to the community.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On behalf of the entire Commodore team, a HUGE THANK YOU goes out to you, our incredible community. Hitting 10K pre-orders of the Commodore 64 Ultimate is only possible because of your passion and support.Together, we’re not just reliving history, we’re building the future… pic.twitter.com/l2YJmQBBgO<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969552927724617988">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>If you unfurl the embedded Tweet, above, you can see the growth in sales charted for the C64 Ultimate (all models). Things got off to a galloping start from the get-go on July 12 this year. From August, we have seen more steady progress in sales numbers. Interestingly, the chart has markers on the timeline to coincide with the ‘Let’s Buy Commodore’ video trilogy releases. These videos got hundreds of thousands of views (one over 400,000), so the Commodore management were obviously measuring the media impact on sales trends.</p><p>Our last report, on how Commodore successfully <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/commodore-took-in-over-usd2-million-during-the-c64-ultimates-debut-week-roadmap-will-include-three-major-releases-a-year" target="_blank">raked in over $2 million</a> during the C64 Ultimate’s debut week, coincided with a video release titled ‘Making History: Signing the Commodore Contract + C64 Ultimate Production Update.’ We also saw a very positive blip in sales around that date. Perhaps people felt assured that Commodore was really back.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2fGP59mJ5M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In a quick follow-up to the 10K milestone Tweet, Commodore reminded its fans that “there’s still time to secure your spot in Batch 1 of the Commodore 64 Ultimate pre-orders over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.commodore.net/">https://www.commodore.net/</a> to make sure you’ll be among the first to receive yours this year.” Pricing for this FPGA-powered retro-futuristic machine featuring the “world's first transparent keyboard circuit board” starts from $299. Readers are reminded that the “Founders Edition will be a one-time run,” and we don’t have word on what will succeed it for latecomers – surely something very similar.</p><p>Retro computing fans should be cheered by this latest Commodore milestone, even if they aren’t particularly interested in experiencing a modern C64. Remember, the new Commodore has quite boldly claimed that it will become a “Founder's Sandbox,” for new computer tech projects. Its roadmap will feature as many as 12 major releases over the next four years – which should be exciting for all computer enthusiasts.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Radeon RX 9070 gains 25% performance in synthetic benchmarks using RX 9070 XT vBIOS ]]>
<p>In an attempt to squeeze more performance out of their GPU, a user on Reddit has successfully flashed the BIOS of a Radeon RX 9070 XT onto their non-XT variant. As per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nlpqx3/flashed_the_reaper_9070_into_a_fake_xt_boosted_my/" target="_blank">post by u/noVa_realiZe</a> on the r/Radeon subreddit, they were pretty satisfied with the results, as their PowerColor RX 9070 Reaper gained an uplift of 25% in synthetic benchmarks, and around 8-12% while gaming.</p><p>The user notes that they performed the vBIOS flash using an open-source tool published on Overclock.net by user Benik3. If you’re interested in the full flashing process, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.overclock.net/threads/amdvbflash-modded.1817620/" target="_blank">follow the post here</a>. Keep in mind, however, that flashing a GPU with the BIOS of another model may void your warranty and can potentially brick your card.</p><p>According to testing done by u/noVa_realiZe, the performance gains from flashing the BIOS were immediately noticeable in synthetic benchmarks. In 3DMark Steel Nomad, the stock non-XT card managed a score of around 5,821, while the same card with the XT BIOS went up to 6,461. After some more tinkering with the voltages and memory clock speeds, the card peaked at 7,277, which is a notable improvement over stock performance.</p><p>The performance uplift is reduced when it comes to actual gaming, though. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with a mix of ray-tracing settings, the undervolted stock card averaged 70 FPS. After flashing and tuning the card, the same setup pushed averages closer to 78 FPS, with noticeable improvements to 1% and 0.1% lows.</p><p>The increase in performance is primarily due to the ability to feed more power to the GPU after flashing the XT BIOS.</p><h2 id="not-the-first-example-2">Not the first example</h2><p>Back in April, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-rx-9070-vbios-flash-offers-up-to-20-percent-performance-boost-modders-claim-oc-beats-9070-xt">similar attempt was made,</a> where a community member at leading German website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Radeon-RX-9070-XT-Grafikkarte-281023/News/BIOS-Flash-1469905/">PCGH (PC Games Hardware)</a> took an Asus Prime RX 9070 and flashed it with the Asus Prime RX 9070 XT vBIOS.</p><p>After successfully flashing the BIOS, they were able to raise its power draw to 317W (up from the stock 220W) and increase the boost clock frequencies to 3.1 GHz. This translated into a consistent 15-20% performance uplift in synthetic benchmark tests, while additional tuning and overclocking resulted in scores that outperformed the stock RX 9070 XT.</p><p>It is interesting to know that the Radeon RX 9070 has a modicum of headroom to deliver more performance, but at the same time, these gains come with trade‐offs. This includes higher power consumption, increased heat, and a real risk of instability or damage, especially if the cooling solution and power delivery system are not adequate.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ President Trump posts an AI-generated image of him trading Intel stock inside the White House — imaginary share was bought at $20 and sold at $30, reflective of real-world prices ]]>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115228705834340561">Taking to his Truth Social platform</a>, President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself successfully trading Intel stock on a triple-monitor setup while sitting inside the White House with the sun glistening on him. It's essential to remember that the goal was not for the state to enrich its coffers through day trading, but rather to ensure that U.S. soil remains the place where the world's best chips are made.</p><p>A few weeks ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/trump-says-u-s-govt-will-take-a-10-percent-ownership-stake-in-intel-lip-bu-tan-reportedly-agreed-to-unprecedented-arrangement-for-a-domestic-chipmaker">the U.S. Government purchased a 10% stake in Intel, </a>an unprecedented move that is bound to shake up economic charts around the world. Intel has been struggling financially for a while, but it remains a homegrown American company and represents the United States' opportunity to lead the semiconductor industry. Intel was already receiving grants via the CHIPS Act to bolster local chipmaking, so the remaining handouts from that, combined with an equity investment in common stock, resulted in the White House now owning 10% of Intel. This investment appears to have been so lucrative that President Trump felt compelled to showcase it on social media.</p><iframe allow="" height="0" width="600" id="" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115228705834340561/embed"></iframe><p>In the picture, the monitor on the <em>far left</em> shows shares bought at $20, which is actually accurate since the real-life purchase occurred at $20.47 per share. The monitor on the <em>far right</em> then shows a massive uptick, with the share apparently sold at $30. That's also somehow accurate, as Intel stock hit $30 a couple of days ago for the first time in over a year. Of course, the government didn’t sell its stake when that occurred, so perhaps it’s more of a personal achievement that President Trump is showcasing.</p><p>The mandatory disclaimer follows: this is not financial advice, but President Trump might influence investors and, more crucially, uninformed people around the country to buy Intel shares and HODL. Not to veer into whole tin-foil-hat territory, but any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-creates-u-s-investment-accelerator-to-manage-chips-act-and-negotiate-much-better-deals">future investments that the White House makes</a> could then become indicative of a seismic market shift, creating a bullish sentiment that pushes people to stock up (no pun intended) on equity in these firms.

An AI-generated image posted by President Trump depicts him buying Intel stock at $20 and selling it at $30 to make a considerable profit. These prices are mostly accurate, given that the real-life purchase occurred at $20.47 per share, and Intel stock reached over $30 just two days ago, although that rise can be attributed to the Nvidia deal instead.

<p>Second screens can be a great asset, and easily pay for themselves by precipitating a productivity boost. They come in all shapes and sizes, leveraging a broad range of technologies, but some products could leave you scratching your head about the best way to fit them into your setup. Especially tiny sub 1-inch screens.</p><p>A peculiar case in point we noticed today is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809755482417.html" target="_blank">the $2.57 WeAct Display FS</a>, listed on AliExpress. That price point seems irresistible for a highly-portable USB interface second screen. However, its postage stamp dimensions (it has a tiny 0.96-inch diagonal screen), means it is something of a curate’s egg. This tiny screen isn’t going to worry the makers of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-portable-monitors">best portable monitors</a>, but could have its niche use cases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Specifications suggest the entire device measures 43 x 14.5mm, but we don’t have a thickness measurement to share.</p><p>Another significant way it strays from the portable second screen norms is that WeAct’s tiny screen doesn’t accept a USB-C or HDMI connection – it has a captive USB-A interface (again, like many USB thumb drives). The connector is reversible in this instance, with an insulator pad supplied for the unused side.</p><p>One side of the WeAct Display FS is almost entirely taken up by its screen. As mentioned previously, this has a 0.96-inch diagonal. Using a bit of math, we can work out that the actual screen measures ~0.429 x 0.858 inches (~10.9 x 24.4mm).</p><p>Across this tiny display, there are 160 x 80 pixels (thus a 2:1 ratio).

]]>
<p>Personalizing the computers we own — whether it's a phone or a proper desktop — is one of life's few simple comforts. It can bring you joy knowing that your favorite picture will greet you every morning when you start your day. Now, movements behind the Windows 11 development scene indicate that pictures could soon be exchanged for videos. Microsoft has finally added the option to use video files as desktop backgrounds in the latest Windows 11 Insider build, and it works seamlessly, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/phantomofearth/status/1969399576026140731" target="_blank">@phantomofearth on X</a>.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows DreamScene is back!

It was a built-in utility that allowed users to put videos as their wallpaper... up until Vista. Unfortunately, DreamScene was pulled from Windows 7 and never made a comeback officially. In the meantime, alternatives like the ever-so-popular Wallpaper Engine rose to fame and replaced DreamScene in the zeitgeist. Many modern gamers today may not even remember that dynamic desktop backgrounds used to be a native feature of the OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It's available as part of the Windows 11 26x20.6690 Dev/Beta builds, for which you have to join the Windows Insider program. Once in, all you have to do is enable feature ID 57645315 and restart the explorer.exe process in Task Manager. After that, just open settings, and you should see .mp4, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .avi, and .webm in the list of supported file formats when you go to select a new wallpaper. Simply pick a video you want and you're good to go.</p><p>Keep in mind that this feature only works on the desktop, not on the lockscreen so you're not going to get those macOS-style aesthetic TikToks out of your utilitarian Windows system anytime soon. More importantly, though, since this is an experimental feature, there's no saying when it will actually make its way to the stable, public release channel — if at all. Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-11-is-getting-a-built-in-internet-speed-test-feature-that-will-take-you-to-bing-along-with-multiple-revamped-settings-pages-latest-insider-channel-builds-reveal-prominent-changes-coming-soon-to-the-os">native speed test button that Microsoft is trialing</a>, this feels like a fairly iterative yet obvious improvement that we should, therefore, see go mainstream relatively soon.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Hackers attack Europe’s automatic flight check-in systems — flight delayed and cancelled after Collins cyberattack ]]>
<p>A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace brought parts of Europe’s airport infrastructure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/european-airports-race-fix-check-in-glitch-after-hacking-disruption-2025-09-21/" target="_blank"><u>to its knees</u></a> this weekend, after a backend outage hit the company's cloud-based check-in system and knocked out self-service kiosks across multiple major hubs. The software in question — Collins’ common-use MUSE platform — powers many airports’ passenger processing stacks, allowing airlines to share check-in desks, kiosks, and boarding infrastructure through a single backend. On Saturday, that single point of failure failed.</p><h2 id="we-re-going-manual-2">We're going manual</h2><p>Heathrow, Berlin Brandenburg, and Brussels Zaventem were among the major airports affected, with Brussels cancelling 45 out of 257 departing flights and warning passengers of delays up to 90 minutes. Heathrow said most flights were still running but slowed by manual fallback procedures, while Berlin suspended kiosk access altogether and shifted to direct airline processing.</p><p>Collins confirmed that the disruption was the result of a “cyber-related incident,” but has not disclosed the type of attack. What is clear is that the cMUSE outage exposed just how fragile Europe’s airport IT stack has become. Designed to be flexible and scalable, cMUSE can be hosted in the cloud or deployed on-prem, but many airports rely on the cloud variant, which centralizes passenger data and logic for easier airline integration.</p><p>According to Collins’ own documentation, cMUSE supports web-based agent stations, kiosk fleets, and mobile check-in endpoints through a centralized management plane. That’s great for cost and updates, but not so great when that control layer goes dark. On-site systems like bag tag printers and biometric scanners are often integrated directly with MUSE, so they’re not immune either.</p><h2 id="eu-directive-to-the-rescue-2">EU directive to the rescue?</h2><p>The EU’s NIS2 directive, which comes into force in October, broadens the legal definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not just airlines and airports, but IT suppliers that provide essential digital services to them. EASA’s Part-IS rules, in parallel, are meant to bring aviation-grade cybersecurity to exactly these kinds of shared platforms, including common-use systems for baggage and check-in.</p><p>It’s not yet clear how much of Collins’ cMUSE infrastructure went down, or how many airline DCS links were affected. But it’s clear that fallback worked only because staff rolled back to manual processes, not because systems failed gracefully. Heathrow said Sunday that it was continuing to recover from the outage, adding that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> </em><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> </em><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Repair wizard converts an RTX 4080 into 4080 Super using BGA magic — Donor board gets intense surgery for a reball upgrade like never before ]]>
<p>It's no secret that we're a fan of eccentric repair stories here at <em>Tom's Hardware</em>; we've already had classics like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/dead-rtx-5090-with-a-cracked-pcb-gets-urgent-surgery-from-repair-wizard-tech-casually-reballs-the-core-replaces-a-memory-chip-twice-and-runs-more-wires-across-its-traces-than-the-nsa">dead RTX 5090 with a cracked PCB being revived</a>, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/botched-gpu-baking-job-is-fixed-by-a-maestro-chef-northwest-repairs-resuscitates-a-dead-graphics-card-by-reballing-its-core-and-memory">RX 7800 XT that was saved after a spoiled reflow attempt</a>. Today's tale is no different — in fact, if anything, this is perhaps the most we've seen one of our persistent GPU repair wizards struggle with a job. Spoiler alert, it works out at the end, but this RTX 4080 Super almost never posted, despite everything being thrown at it.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZeSKgwR8ds" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Tony from Northwest Repair got his hands on an RTX 4080 Super that he couldn't repair — not for lack of trying though (as you'll see), it was simply broken beyond saving. Our intrepid repairer, therefore, salvaged the working core and VRAM from the 4080 Super and brought in a donor PCB... which is actually a core and memory-less RTX 4080 non-Super. The discrepancy doesn't matter for a master like Tony. "<em>Board looks identical, so should work</em>," he says, and continues with the repair that will involve taking a 4080 Super core and mounting it on a standard 4080 board. A new VBIOS will be needed for the GPU to accept its identity, so the BIOS chip will need to be swapped as well.</p><p>The repair starts with flattening the donor PCB since it came from China, where it became severely warped in the process of stripping it off its core — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/underground-china-repair-shops-thrive-servicing-illicit-nvidia-gpus-banned-by-export-restrictions-companies-resurrecting-banned-ai-accelerators-at-a-rate-of-up-to-500-per-month">something very common in the region</a>. It was put on a custom heating plate with weights on top that should help straighten it some degree (no pun intended). After that, the soldering job begins. Tony casually solders the 4080 Super core onto the 4080 board in a beautiful montage, along with the memory modules and the BIOS chip, all while the PCB is sitting onto the heat plate, slowly leveling itself.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Tony ran a memory test, and it pinged two chips as the point of failure, but just to be sure he took off the core again to check whether it's sitting flat first. Sure enough, one of the solder balls on the core was much larger than the others surrounding it. Our repair guru wasn't interested in the why-s or how-s, so he just went ahead and reballed it. Unfortunately, it still didn't work, though the culprit identified itself right away: two data lines weren't connected to the core.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Taking off the core once again confirmed this notion, as the bottom left and right corners of the solder pads were not in contact with the core. These corners were at a lower elevation compared to the middle of the core, which is sitting higher due to the PCB being warped from the start; the weights didn't work. In comes new weights directly on the core itself, but they change nothing. Still, no post — even after thoroughly cleaning the interconnect to rule out the riser cable.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The weights make a return and after some tedious back and forth — and a Ron Swanson throwing his TV in the dumpster clip classic later — the card finally comes back to life. Usually the repeated heat cycles can warp a PCB but since this was one was already warped to begin with, it perhaps had the opposite effect.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Northwest Repair is back with another legendary fix, this time it's an RTX 4080 Super being transplanted onto an RTX 4080's body. The core and memory from an otherwisen dead 4080 Super was salvaged to be put onto a very similar-looking 4080 non-Super donor board. The task was far from simple, but Tony made it work by the end.

<![CDATA[ ComMarker Omni X review: a refined 5W UV laser cutter and engraver ]]>
<p>ComMarker has followed up its popular Omni 1 UV laser with the new Omni X, a similar 5W model but with some intriguing and perhaps compelling advances. We had the chance to have a thorough hands-on review period with the new machine pre-launch, over a period of several weeks, to assess how it ranks among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-laser-cutters-and-engravers">Best Laser Cutters and Engravers</a> in the market today.</p><p>So, what’s new? Top of the list among the new stuff is, firstly, the fact that ComMarker has made this UV laser fully enclosed as standard. Building on this feature, there’s a sensor-backed auto-stop function to cease the powerful and potentially harmful laser light output if this cover is lifted – or if you try and start a job when the cover isn’t fully closed. This safety cover moves up and down manually, using a handle.</p><p>Secondly, ComMarker has added an optional slide extension, effectively expanding the piddling 150 x 150mm galvanometer UV laser work area to a more ample 450 x 150mm area. As per the feature’s name, this new ability comes courtesy of a motorized slider that integrates into the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

All you have to do is hit ‘Autofocus’ in the ComMarker application UI to ensure sharp and accurate results. The manual up/down buttons and steel ruler integrated into the galvanometer (galvo) head remain, so you can tweak settings manually should you wish/need. You might want to engrave glass under the focus point/surface, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

</h2><p>The ComMarker Omni X was provided in a part-assembled kit form. It had all the machine parts, fasteners, power and data cabling, and tools required for assembly (like Allen keys). Extra safety glasses were supplied, which was reassuring for double protection (the machine has a built-in safety visor), as was a 50cm steel ruler. Last but not least, ComMarker included quite a broad range of sample materials for makers to add their designs to.</p><div class="inlinegallery

</h2><p>ComMarker’s Omni X is quite a tall, imposing beast measuring 515 x 320 x 655 mm (20.3 x 12.6 x 25.8-inches), and weighing 32kg (70.5 pounds). The shipment came in at around 70 kg (~150 pounds), too. Once assembled, it isn’t ungainly, though. Most of the time you will only touch the machine to interact with the protective hood handle, to get to the working bed (which is bristling with threaded holes).</p><p>Access to the bed, various fixings, a finely adjustable platform, and buttons for emergency stop, power, and manually moving the laser head up and down are all at a regular table height, more or less. That is, if you place the Omni X on a regular table.</p><h2 id="assembly-and-preparation-2">Assembly and preparation</h2><p>This is quite a heavy and sizable machine, as shown in the specs table. Nevertheless, building it wasn’t a difficult task, as I would describe the device, as it was delivered already partially assembled. I spent a much longer time assembling the budget aluminum extrusion framed SculpFun S9 diode laser (with its pulleys and belts), which will likely become redundant now.</p><p>ComMarker had everything very carefully packaged, with components either obvious what they were, or clearly labeled. The provided manual guides you through starting with the platform, bolting on the height-adjustable pedestal, and then the laser head unit on top of it.</p><p>Quite a lot of allen screws were needed to secure the back/top cover, which is metal, heavy, and packed with fans atop. However, the trickiest thing I found was fixing the green safety cover. There were just two slim screws attached to the slider mechanism on either side, and I had to get help to balance this quite heavy component while it was fixed in place. If not for balance, I worried about screw, shearing, or cracking the green plastic.</p><p>Turning on the finished assembled machine for the first time, it is surprisingly loud. But the noise* doesn’t change whether cutting (or engraving), it is just the ‘ColdFront 2.0 thermal system’ keeping the UV laser components happy. ComMarker’s description of this cooling system as “quiet” might be relative to other UV lasers, but in PC cooling terms, it isn’t quiet!</p><p>I completed a rough test in my garage with a background noise level of around 34dB (fridge, gas boiler running, etc). Turning on the Omni X saw the dB meter read a sustained 68dB from about 30cm (12 inches) away.</p><p>* <em>ComMarker wrote to us to say that it was implementing a sensor to "add a temperature control switch to the machine." The purpose of this, based on early review feedback, is to reduce the fan noise when the machine isn't actually cutting or engraving. According to the firm, this change reduced machine noise "from about 71dB to 63dB," in its tests. Omni X machines that ship to paying customers will include this refinement.</em></p><h2 id="software-2">Software
</h2><p>I was advised to test this Omni X, a pre-mass-production sample from ComMarker, with the firm’s own branded new software package. The PC application installed easy enough and has an interface similar to other similar tools.</p><p>Central to the UI you see the canvas, which for most of my testing of the Omni X would be 150mm square. The toolbar to the left allows the creation of text as well as a few primitive vector shapes. These can be outlines (great for cutting) or filled shapes. Beneath these are icons to import a bitmap or vector graphics file straight onto the canvas. Then there are some more specialized tools.</p><p>To the right of the canvas area, a context-sensitive panel shows the laser marking settings for each selected object or group. Thus, you can place a few graphics and have different engraving intensities applied (for different effects or shades), If you were also cutting, you’d adjust parameters for the shape you were cutting to match the material.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This might be understandable, as this is new software, but I wasted quite a lot of time, moving through three revisions of the software. And this is software which isn’t yet properly documented and surprised me with some of its issues.</p><p>As of the time of writing, on the latest software, everything seems to be working as intended though, touch wood, fingers crossed, etc.</p><h2 id="engraving-and-cutting-2">Engraving and cutting
</h2><p>So, we have lots of engraving and cutting possibilities here. Some of these materials are confidently engraved or cut by diode and fiber (IR) lasers. However, the UV laser in the Omni X has its own strengths and weaknesses – mostly strengths though, as you should expect given the price tag.</p><p>To get ready for any job, you place the material on the platform and hit the focus button to the lower right side of the software UI. If it grumbles that it isn’t in focus, it usually manages it on the second press!</p><p>Next, you will want to check if the artwork you wish to laser cut or etch fits in the physical size constraints of the material. Click preview to see. You can also choose whether to preview the selected object on the canvas or its contour.</p><p>ComMarker supplies a green translucent paddle so you can check the preview bounds, as on many materials you can’t see evidence of the UV light bounds being repeatedly traced out by the galvo. This makes things a little tricky as the paddle is quite cloudy and about 5mm thick. On small, irregular shaped objects you can’t just put the paddle down on top, as it will slide or tilt.</p><p>The above processes apply to all jobs, but at some point before pressing ‘Start’ you will also need to load, input and/or adjust the Laser Settings parameters.</p><p><strong>👉 First test – Wood</strong></p><p>I am very familiar with engraving (burning) and cutting plywood sheets with my diode laser, so thought it was the best place to start. This was my first UV test!</p><p>Sadly, somehow the ‘continuous’ button, located just above the Start button, had been ticked by accident. So my first test of a material cutting and engraving matrix ran far far beyond the timer that claimed the process would take under 300s. As this was my first experience of the machine, and there are so many warnings about UV lasers, I thought it was a software bug where the 1s remaining dialog box would just go away a little later. I got fed up about 3 hours later, decided to hit cancel, only to find out my job had been ruined…</p><p>I talked with ComMarker, and they said the continuous checkbox was “mainly designed for long-running tasks like cutting through 5mm glass, where the laser needs to keep running without interruption.” They agreed it shouldn’t be alongside frequently toggled preview controls and right next to the Start button. They haven’t moved it deeper into the UI yet, though.</p><p>With that drama behind me, I found wood engraving and cutting quick and efficient on the UV laser. Indeed, the ‘cold burn’ technology here could cut the 3mm ply samples very cleanly and rather quickly.</p><p>ComMarker’s guidance had suggested 15 passes to cut this material, but I tested 10 passes with success, and even six passes worked. Of course, using fewer passes (if you can) means there’s less chance of charring, and it saves considerable time. In my example, moving from 15 to six passes reduced the work time for cuts from 50 to 20 seconds.</p><p>Engraving on wood was equally swift, with adjustments to number of passes, laser beam speed, and others providing different effects. Perhaps this is a weak point of a UV laser system, though. ‘Zero burn’ tech means that the wide range of black levels produced by laser-induced charring are largely absent here. Check out my other sample pictures to see what I mean.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>You can see some more wood engraving work as part of my feature where I make an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/search?searchTerm=apple+adb+converter" target="_blank">Apple ADB to USB converter</a> dongle.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Since they look so ‘expensive’ I thought I would try one of the 12 mini shot tumblers I got from eBay first.</p><p>After poor results over several attempts, I talked to ComMarker, and they asked me to manually raise the laser head 2 or 3mm up from its LiDAR determined focus point.

Well, except for the output size being too big on the first shot - due to one of those software bugs I mentioned previously. The <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> logo looks great on this glass, even with one side ‘zoomed in’ like it was an intentional part of the design (it wasn’t). On closer inspection, though, it would probably be worthwhile tweaking the settings with the hope of getting sharper straight edges on some of the letters. There are various advanced line/hatching settings available.</p><p>I didn’t have any clear or colored acrylic samples for testing, but they should be easily within the capabilities of the Omni X, and I was given seven presets for different types of acrylic, and both engraving and cutting settings.</p><h2 id="bottom-line-2">Bottom Line</h2><p>The ComMarker Omni X delivers some worthwhile improvements to last year’s well regarded Omni 1. The safety visor is welcome, as is the 99.72% Dust Isolation feature delivered by the enclosure with suitable extractor hose attached. Another refinement here is the compatibility with the slider extension, as well as the existing roller/rotational add-on that fits the Omni 1 and X.</p><p>Standout positives included the UV technology at this laser's heart - with 'cold burn' and ultra precise 0.0019mm laser beam capability. Inherent to galvo type laser like this are fast movements, with the laser point capable of moving at a quoted 15,000 mm/s.</p><p>Pondering over negatives, we might complain about the size and weight of this device - which seems large given its 150mm square work area (without extender). I'd also repeat my grumbles about software teething trouble...</p><p>ComMarker’s software irked me during my few weeks of testing, and I went through versions of it which fixed one thing but then introduced a different brand-new wrinkle. However, getting the right settings and tuning to a sweet spot was the main battle – which can be the case with many a laser. I’ve talked with ComMarker about this, and they tell me consumer production machines will have all the correct calibrated parameters saved to the motherboard ahead of shipping. That way they will be out of the scope of accidental software tinkering. I’ve also found that the material library presets in the Laser Settings part of the UI have gotten better in the newer releases of the software. This provides a faster route to refining your settings for different materials.</p><p>It would be a shame if the software let down what seems to be excellently, sturdily built hardware. It is noted, though, that this UV laser is compatible with LightBurn software, which I’ve tried with good results before. Please note, you will need the $200 ‘galvo’ license of LightBurn to accompany this model, though. ComMarker told me the Omni X will launch with a USB stick for consumers, containing a LightBurn materials library and presets.</p><p>Personally, the UV laser is a big step-up in speed and cutting power, and opens up a lot of material flexibility. But machines like this come with a considerable price tag. We have been told that the Omni X will retail starting from $4,599, with bundles including accessories like the rotary and slider attachments rising to $5,099. And those are Early Bird prices.</p><p>However, if you have a workflow, or intended workflow that would benefit from the power, speed, and accuracy shown here, the outlay may be worth it. As is often the case, a wise decision is all about horses for courses.</p><ul><li><strong>Omni X Basic Bundle:</strong> Early bird $4,599 / Regular $5,299</li><li><strong>Omni X Rotary Bundle (with R5 roller): </strong>Early bird $4,859 / Regular $5,683</li><li><strong>Omni X Slider Bundle:</strong> Early bird $5,099 / Regular $6,044</li><li><strong>Omni X Ultimate Bundle (Slider + R5 roller + 100W Fume Extractor): </strong>Early bird $5,689 / Regular $6,947</li></ul><p>For alternative laser cutter and engraver choices, at all kinds of price points, please check out our frequently updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-laser-cutters-and-engravers">Best Laser Cutters and Engravers 2025 guide</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[ Iconic 80s Vectrex console reimagined for the modern day with OLED display, microSD, and wireless controllers — half-size Vectrex Mini could cost as little as $99 for early birds ]]>
<p>Retro gaming has seen a resurgence in recent years, thanks in part to a lot of cult classics being revived as fan projects, modernized to fit in the gaming landscape of today (or offer an antithesis to it). The latest in the line of these revivals is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vectrex.com/" target="_blank">Vectrex Mini</a> — a scaled-down version of the original Vectrex home console, now adorned with all sorts of upgrades that not only make it worth considering all over again, but also genuinely improve the appeal of the device to a solid retro machine.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out the Vectrex Mini prototype, the screen rendering is still being refined but seeing it in action already gives an idea of the experience...Full video: https://t.co/B44vUdMLm8Vectrex mini Kickstarter: https://t.co/2W0S7bkWNe pic.twitter.com/scmlRICX8J<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969099108351652188">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>For those who weren't around back then, the Vectrex is somewhat of a legend in the retro gaming community. Back in the 80s, it was already doing something different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appuals.com/colecovision/" target="_blank">ColecoVision</a> and Intellivision — themselves standouts compared to Atari's reign at the time. It focused on vector graphics titles and completely eliminated the need for a separate TV. The Vectrex came with its own CRT display embedded onto the console, like an Arcade machine, that could display sharp vector graphics with their signature glowing lines. It was an all-in-one gaming system when such a concept was almost unheard of.</p><p>It flopped, unfortunately, but the legacy it left behind paved the way for a generation of handhelds and plug-and-play systems to come. The way its controller was nicely tucked away right in the console inspired the docking systems we have today; even the homebrew culture that's been the backbone of emulation can be traced back to the Vectrex — the community resorted to modding and making their own games since the library was so limited. Its design was also ahead of time, so while direct influence isn't where the Vectrex shines, its impact silently echoes through the years, making it the perfect contender for a revival.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The team has worked hard to keep as much of the original design as possible, while shrinking it down considerably. Given its "mini" nature (miniature?), the size has been cut down by about half and the screen is now a 5-inch AMOLED panel designed to emulate the look of old CRTs (we shall see). The controller is smaller, too, but it's now wireless and sports the same button layout and arcade-style joystick — though that might become cramped for some, but thankfully it seems like third-party USB controllers should be supported as well.</p><p>The Vectrex Mini is powered by USB-C, and features an HDMI port for connecting the device to a TV and a MicroSD Card slot to load up your own games, alongside the 12 it already comes with. The original Vectrex had a monochrome screen and used physical
overlays to "display" color, the Vectrex Mini will honor that by emulating different colors for each of the built-in games in software, thanks to the OLED display. All of this is currently in prototype form only, which the creators showed off at Gamescom.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A closer look at the Vectrex Mini prototype... pic.twitter.com/TbvNkV9FN8<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1958459304631271838">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Pricing hasn't been officially disclosed, but there are murmurs of a €150 ask, which is quite reasonable considering the original Vectrex now goes for upwards of $800 on the aftermarket. The Vectrex Mini will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1852390947/vectrex-mini" target="_blank">available through Kickstarter,</a> where the campaign will launch in November. There will be a special white edition for €219, too, with an exclusive badge and a certificate of authenticity to boot. Furthermore, we hear there'll be early bird pricing at just $99 for the first 50 units, and $129 for the first 200.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

As is customary with projects like these, Vectrex Mini is not made the same people who created the original Vectrex; Neo Retro bought the licensing rights and has developed the Vectrex Mini in France, with David “Flynn” Oghia leading the team.

<![CDATA[ AMD relaunches $40 dual-core Athlon 3000G CPU with new packaging and cooler — Zen refuses to retire even in 2025 ]]>
<p>It has become common practice for AMD and Intel to re-release processors from several generations-old architectures. Japanese news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/news/2047992.html">Akiba</a> reports that AMD has relaunched its entry-level dual-core Athlon 3000G with new packaging and a cooler, featuring part number YD3000C6FHSBX. The chip is on sale for ¥5,790, which translates to approximately $40.</p><p>The Athlon 3000G is one of the slowest CPUs you can install in an AM4 motherboard. The CPU was released in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-unveils-threadripper-3960x-and-3970x-ryzen-9-3950x-details-and-athlon-3000g/3">2019</a> as AMD's entry-level processor, succeeding the Athlon 200GE series that preceded it. The chip has two unlocked Zen CPU cores, four threads, just 4MB of L3 cache, a 35W TDP, and a 3.5 GHz clock speed. For graphics, the 3000G comes with a Vega 3-based iGPU featuring three CUs, 192 cores, and a 1.1GHz clock speed.</p><p>AMD launched a second variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-continues-to-sell-14nm-zen-cpus-in-2023">chip in 2023</a>, featuring a beefier Wraith cooler, new packaging, and a newer die based on the Dali architecture. Dali was an offshoot of Raven Ridge that was cheaper to manufacture, but based on the same 14nm process. As a result, performance is identical between the original and refreshed versions. One interesting tidbit about the Dali die is that it only features two physical cores; by contrast, the original Raven Ridge version of the 3000G had a quad-core die with two disabled cores.</p><p>The latest re-release is unsurprisingly based on the newer Dali version of the Athlon 3000G. The aforementioned part number (YD3000C6FHSBX) confirms this. Models with the letters "FH" included signify that they are the newer models; by contrast, part numbers including "FB" represent the original models.</p><p>It may seem silly for AMD to release an entry-level CPU that is now six years old, running on an architecture introduced eight years ago. But AMD would not release a CPU like this unless it knew there was still a market for it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-launches-a-budget-gaming-beast-ryzen-5-5500x3d-arrives-for-the-latin-american-market">Ryzen 5 5500X3D</a> is an excellent example of this being an "all-new" Ryzen CPU based on the Zen 3 architecture, but it is region-locked to Latin America. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-launches-four-new-ryzen-cpus-including-cutdown-zen-4-and-zen-3-models-most-only-available-in-global-markets">Ryzen 5 5600F and Ryzen 5 7400</a> are similar, both being locked to the Asian market.</p><p>Intel is also no stranger to this strategy; it recently released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-14nm-desktop-cpus-are-making-a-comeback-chipmaker-inexplicably-resurrects-comet-lake-from-five-years-ago-with-new-core-i5-110">Core i5-110</a>, based on its Comet Lake 14nm architecture, an architecture that debuted five years ago in chips such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-10900k-cpu-review">Core i9-10900K</a>.</p><p>The only caveat owners will need to be aware of is motherboard compatibility for the 3000G. The chip is so old that AMD's latest iteration of 500-series AM5 motherboards doesn't support it. Technically, these boards can help, but AMD has released so many AM4 CPUs over the past eight years that there likely isn't enough room in the firmware memory of 500-series motherboards to accommodate such old chips.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ ‘Proper next-gen Amiga’ launched by Apollo Computing — promises full FPGA-powered backwards compatibility with its new 68080 chip ]]>
<p>Apollo Computing stepped forward to reveal its “Proper next-gen Amiga” to the masses earlier this week. The German firm has unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a6000.net/">Apollo A6000</a>, a comprehensive modern Amiga system featuring advanced technologies, including a “cutting-edge V4 AC68080” FPGA, which makes it the “most powerful Amiga 68k compatible ever created.”</p><p>Moreover, the Apollo A6000 retains the cutesy retro styling of the Amiga A600 (probably that machine’s best feature), enhanced by eye-popping tech specs and a built-in mechanical keyboard.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNGrgfX5bqc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Vintage Amigans may best remember Apollo for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-emulates-amiga-1200-uses-real-floppy-disks">Amiga A1200</a> trapdoor accelerators, and more recently for Vampire FPGA accelerator boards for a host of legacy Commodore machines.

<![CDATA[ Microsoft Gaming Copilot hits Windows in public beta — in-game AI overlay goes live for PC players ]]>
<p>Microsoft began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/09/19/gaming-copilot-beta-coming-to-windows-pc/">rolling out its new Gaming Copilot assistant</a> to Windows users as part of a public beta on September 19, following a previous rollout to Xbox Insiders in August. The feature, located within the Xbox Game Bar overlay, provides players with real-time in-game support using AI-driven context from their screen and Xbox account.</p><p>Unlike past versions of Copilot integrated into Windows or Microsoft 365, Gaming Copilot is built with screen context and real-time game awareness. It reads from your Xbox account history, sees what you’re playing, and can analyze screen content on demand to answer in-game questions. Microsoft says it’s designed to help players find achievements, plan builds, and navigate quests without needing to alt-tab to wikis or YouTube.</p><p>On paper, Gaming Copilot resembles third-party tools like Overwolf, but it operates at the system level within the Game Bar overlay, which provides more reliable full-screen behavior and compatibility with DirectX titles. Microsoft has also confirmed that the assistant can be pinned as a widget and activated with push-to-talk voice controls, two features already present in this early beta.</p><p>The company has not disclosed whether any of the Copilot inference runs locally or if it’s entirely cloud-based. There is also no mention of NPU acceleration, which would matter for players using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-last-15-hours-on-our-battery-test-but-intel-systems-not-that-far-behind">Snapdragon X</a> laptops or hybrid-core CPUs with on-device AI blocks. This will be a key testing point, particularly as Microsoft has framed the Copilot experience as optimized for new handhelds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/microsofts-new-handheld-gaming-mode-exclusive-to-rog-xbox-ally-has-just-leaked-for-every-handheld-running-windows-11-all-you-need-is-the-25h2-update-and-a-few-registry-tweaks">ROG Ally X</a>.</p><p>Anti-cheat compatibility is another open question. Vendors like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye generally whitelist Game Bar itself, but Copilot is a more complex overlay, and Microsoft hasn’t clarified whether any specific protections are in place. With real-time screenshot analysis and persistent widgets, it’s not clear how Copilot will behave in titles with aggressive DRM or competitive match enforcement.</p><p>With the release of Gaming Copilot, Microsoft appears to be making a concerted effort to make Windows feel more like a native gaming platform. Just days before the Copilot rollout, the company updated the Xbox app to serve as a unified launcher that aggregates titles from Steam, Epic, GOG, and others. Together, these changes transform Windows from a passive host OS to an active participant in the gaming experience.</p><p>Gaming Copilot is now available for players aged 18 and older, in all regions except mainland China.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Asus TUF Gaming F16 review: Strong gaming performance offset by skimpy SSD, short battery life ]]>
<p>If you’re looking to enjoy some 1080p gaming without shelling out a lot of money, we had the chance to review the new Asus TUF Gaming F16 gaming laptop. It uses Nvidia’s entry-level RTX 5050 GPU with an added twist. While some laptops have opted for a higher-tier RTX 5060 with lower TDPs, the TUF Gaming F16 is packing a potent 115-watt RTX 5050 that helps to level the playing field for gaming.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 is an imposing laptop thanks to its 16-inch frame, and it manages to incorporate a generous assortment of ports, an RGB keyboard, a numberpad, and a 165 Hz IPS display. Given its as-tested MSRP of $1,199, the TUF Gaming F16 offers strong performance, but that comes with a couple of caveats.</p><h2 id="design-of-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Design of the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>One word can be used to describe the TUF Gaming F16's design: understated. While the TUF Gaming F16 is first and foremost a gaming machine, it features a clean exterior, finished in black and light grey. The aluminum lid is minimalistic, with just the letters "TUF" and the accompanying logo embossed in the top corner.</p><p>There are some interesting touches, including the rear exhaust panel with triangle- and rhombus-shaped cutouts. There's also a nifty four-leaf status LED at the top of the rear deck (behind the display) – it blinks to signify power status, drive access, etc.</p><div class="inlinegallery

At the native 1200p resolution with the Ultra preset, I averaged around 90 frames per second (FPS) through most scenes in the game. Heavy action on-screen caused the frame rates to dip to the 70 FPS range, but the play experience was generally excellent.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

The Nitro V 16S AI achieved 32 FPS at 1080p and 27 FPS at 1200p, which was actually just behind the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p><em>Far Cry 6</em> (Ultra settings) saw the TUF Gaming F16 push its way to the front of the pack, with 90 FPS at 1080p and 86 FPS at 1200p — the Nitro V 16S AI well behind, at 82 FPS and 79 FPS, respectively. The 16 Aurora pulled up the rear (not by much), with 81 FPS at 1080p.</p><p>It was another three-way race in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (Medium settings), with our review unit easily keeping up with the other two competitors. The TUF Gaming F16 and Nitro V 16S AI scored identically, with 68 FPS at 1080p and 64 FPS at 1200p.</p><p>Finally, the <em>Borderlands 3</em> benchmark (Badass settings), saw the TUF Gaming F16 hit 81 FPS at 1080p and 75 FPS at 1200p, compared to 82 FPS and 81 FPS, respectively, for the Nitro V 16S AI. The 16 Aurora was the leader at 1080p with 83 FPS.</p><p>The overall sentiment here is that despite being a lower-level SKU in the RTX 50 Series, Asus’ implementation of the RTX 5050 with a 115W TGP and a 2,092 MHz max boost clock allows it to remain competitive with the TGP-capped RTX 5060 competition.</p><p><em>Metro Exodus</em> remains our go-to benchmark for gaming laptop stress testing. Our review unit averaged 65.62 FPS at 1080p across 15 loops using the RTX benchmark preset. The CPU performance cores averaged 3.0 GHz, and the efficiency cores averaged 2.53 GHz. The RTX 5060 GPU also ran at 2.53 GHz.</p><h2 id="productivity-performance-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Productivity Performance on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Our review unit has a Core i7-14650HX "Raptor Lake" processor, which has 8 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. That processor is paired with just 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, instead of the 32GB found on the competing laptops (while the Aurora was far more expensive as tested, the Acer was $100 more). SSD storage is also a bit on the stingy side at 512GB, which doesn’t leave a lot of space for games after you take into account the standard Windows 11 Home install.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 started strong in the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, achieving a single-core score of 2,710 and a multi-core score of 15,013. That performance put it slightly ahead of the Acer (Ryzen 7 260) and Alienware (Core i7-240H) contenders in single-core, with a healthier margin of victory for multi-core.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Asus is using a 512GB Micron 2500 Series PCIe 4.0 SSD, rated for 6,600 MBps sequential reads and 3,650 MBps sequential writes. In our test, the SSD only managed 775.5 MBps compared to 1,170.12 MB/s for the 16 Aurora. The Nitro V 16S AI left our review unit in the dust, more than doubling its results (1,838.88 MBps). Going with a 512GB SSD was already painful, but the lagging performance just adds insult to injury. In the real world, I noticed some sluggishness when installing games onto the SSD.</p><p>Our Handbrake benchmark involves transcoding a 4K video file to 1080p. The TUF Gaming F16 completed the task in 3 minutes and 33 seconds, easily dispatching the other two systems.

An IPS panel is employed here, accompanied by a relatively brisk 165 Hz refresh rate.

In practice, there was little to complain about with respect to how colors were represented on the display. The anti-reflective coating might blunt colors just a tad compared to a glossy finish, but everything that I threw at the TUF Gaming F16 looked great. I spent a few hours toiling around in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and came away impressed with how gorgeous the varying environments were.</p><p>I also watched a few episodes of my new favorite TV show, <em>The Pitt</em>, on the display. Unlike some previous medical dramas, which lean heavily on unrealistic darkened set design to create a certain mood, <em>The Pitt</em> is bathed in the stark bright lights of a typical hospital. There's nowhere to hide under these illuminating conditions. From the various colors of the scrubs worn by nurses, interns, and doctors, to their lifelike gushes of blood (and other bodily fluids) that shoot across the screen, I felt fully immersed in the frantic emergency room environment.</p><h2 id="keyboard-and-touchpad-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Keyboard and Touchpad on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>The TUF Gaming F16 uses a full-size keyboard plus a dedicated numberpad. The keys have 1.7 mm of travel and are adequately spaced to occupy as much of the width afforded by the 16-inch frame as possible. While the majority of the keys feature black keycaps, the WASD keys are clear, which allows more of the RGB coloring to shine through when enabled.</p><p>Speaking of RGB, the TUF Gaming F16 uses a single-zone RGB setup (compared to four zones for the Acer) that can be configured with the Armory Crate app. You can also quickly change Aura Effects using the Fn + F4 key combination.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Of course, this was with the volume raised to about 30% to overpower the laptop’s twin cooling fans.</p><p>I also took the time to slink into the melodic tranquility of “Mujahedin and Opium,” a John Barry track from the James Bond film, <em>The Living Daylights</em>. The song is a perfect mix of percussion, strings, and soaring brass that gives it a majestic quality (and is probably one of my favorite pieces in the lengthy catalog of James Bond soundtracks).

However, the results weren’t as promising as I would have hoped. While the overall resolution seemed slightly better than the 720p webcams I’ve recently encountered, the colors were somewhat washed out and not as well saturated. My skin typically appears brown in webcams, but it looks a bit greyer on the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p>Overall, the webcam was just adequate, and I wouldn’t chalk it up as being anywhere near the top of its class.

To add insult to injury, storage performance lagged well behind the competition. Most laptops in this price range give you double the RAM and double the storage space. While you could upgrade this system to fix these problems, that would be easier to swallow at a $999 price point.</p><p>Battery life was also just average, with the TUF Gaming F16 lasting just under 7 hours compared to over 10 hours for the Acer Nitro V 16S AI.</p><p>In my opinion, the Nitro V 16S AI is the better overall laptop, boasting far superior battery life, comparable gaming performance, twice the storage space, and twice the RAM. It’ll cost you $100 more, but it’s well worth the extra coin.</p>

<![CDATA[ Borderlands 4 props come to 3D printing fans — Ripper mask, replica weapons, and cosplay components come in a new collection from Prusa Research ]]>
<p>On the day <em>Borderlands 4</em> hit shelves, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prusa3d.com/article/borderlands-4-and-prusa-research-partner-for-free-launch-day-3d-printable-cosplay-models_243355/">Prusa</a> and developer Gearbox Software published a library of official models on Printables.com that has seen over 20,000 downloads in the first week. The collection includes the franchise’s iconic Psycho mask, a variety of replica weapons, and detailed cosplay components — all verified and test-printed on Prusa 3D printers.</p><p>It’s not unusual to find creators on YouTube showing off fan art and cosplay pieces inspired by video games and movies. However, lately, the studios have been getting directly involved in the process. Adam Savage’s <em>Tested</em> worked with Bethesda to first create, then release, a printable <em>Frontier </em>model from <em>Starfield</em>. Joel Telling, AKA the 3D Printing Nerd, collaborated with Paramount on a massive Optimus Primal model to promote <em>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</em>. That model, along with an Optimus Primal flexi, was released for free on Printables and was downloaded thousands of times by fans. These projects gave makers official 3D files, tutorials, and build videos that blurred the line between studio content and maker culture.</p><p>Now, Prusa Research is stepping into that role directly. The Czech 3D-printer company is forging partnerships with both entertainment studios and global brands to provide makers with officially licensed 3D files that are both fun and practical.</p><p>“I love when the line between digital and physical blurs,” said Josef Průša, founder and CEO of Prusa Research. “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/is-borderlands-4-the-new-crysis-official-gpu-setting-recommendations-peg-4k-performance-with-the-rtx-5090-at-60-fps-with-dlss-and-frame-generation-enabled"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches, and on the same day you can already have a Ripper mask sitting on your desk. That’s just awesome. Usually, props like this take weeks of work to design from scratch. Now it’s literally: click, print, and a piece of Borderlands is in your hands.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Earlier this year, Prusa added models from <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> by CD Projekt RED, providing cosplayers with accurate files for props and costume parts. The site also hosts licensed files from Czech titles such as <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and Bohemia Interactive’s <em>Arma</em> and <em>DayZ</em>.</p><p>Prusa isn’t stopping with games. The company has also courted major tech brands, encouraging them to release 3D-printable accessories, mods, and replacement parts directly to the Printables maker community. Collaborations have included custom PC cases from Corsair, Noctua fan ducts, and combs to fit Phillips electric razors.</p><p>These projects are part of a broader strategy by Prusa to position 3D printing as a bridge between brands and their customers – at least the ones with 3D printers. By offering free, studio-approved files, companies can engage players and consumers in a way that feels both collectible and creative. Cosplayers gain reliable, detailed models, while hobbyists enjoy high-quality parts without the guesswork of reverse-engineering from screenshots.</p><p>With Printables.com serving as a central hub, official models don’t need to be scattered across fan forums or buried in unverified repositories. Though Printables is part of the Prusa Research family, their website and slicers are open to makers with any brand of 3D printer.</p><p>For Prusa, this is just the beginning. The company says it plans to expand its portfolio of partnerships and may even host design competitions tied to popular brands. With the arrival of <em>Borderlands 4</em> files, it’s easy to imagine a future where launch-day exclusives aren’t just posters or skins, but STL or 3MF files that fans can bring to life on their printers.</p><p>As digital content increasingly overlaps with physical fandom, Prusa’s collaborations suggest that branded 3D printing may become as common as DLC or limited-edition merch, except this time, you get to manufacture it yourself at home.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Ukraine has finished testing a new kamikaze strike drone design, which it says can overcome the hurdles presented by Russian electronic warfare (EW). The new Brave1 drones offer extended range, beyond 50km (31 miles), according to the Ukrainian Defense Innovations organization. Moreover, the designers assert that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brave1ukraine_kamikaze-strike-drones-with-a-range-of-40-activity-7373286576396591105--1g_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAHyV20B4QsZQrWqreoc3vrbdvurAHmEscY" target="_blank">the new drones will deliver</a> "a new level of enemy destruction far behind the front lines."</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It is then hoped to “accelerate the mass deployment of strike drones on the battlefield.” This should be more easily achieved if it is indeed true that the Brave1 kamikaze drones are “affordable to manufacture and ready for scaling.”</p><p>Details of the key electronic warfare-resistant technology being used by the new Brave1 drones are scarce. Understandably, Brave1 wants to keep details of its key drone innovation(s) under wraps.

<![CDATA[ Repairer brands customer’s gaming PC a ‘monstrosity’ — skin lacerating cable management technique provokes horror ]]>
<p>A PC repair professional was sent in a system to fix that had some unusual, and possibly hazardous, modifications. Redditor and repair shop owner, elishalewisusaf, didn’t shy away from branding the stricken PC a “monstrosity.” Indeed, the PSU shroud looks like it was ripped open by a xenomorph, breaking through the perforated steel venting to protect its hive.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"
><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1njkgpg/i_own_a_tech_repair_business_and_this_monstrosity">I own a tech repair business - and this monstrosity came in.

The PSU shroud already featured a modestly sized cutout for cable routing, just below the xenomorph breach zone. Indeed, elishalewisusaf is also “baffled” by what they saw when this PC arrived in the repair shop.</p><p>The assembled social media-based PC building experts generally opine that the twisted metal surgery this PC has undergone, presumably by the owner, is user error, to put it politely. However, some are charitable enough to suggest the 8-pin cable from PSU to GPU may have been too short to take a more scenic route. That would mean it was an unusually short cable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

So, we don’t know if the twisted metal mess between the PSU zone and the rest of the PC actually caused a functional problem. It would not be surprising if some of the cabling we can’t see is damaged or shorting, due to metal shards or dust.</p><h2 id="once-a-proud-pc-system-2">Once a proud PC system</h2><p>Also in the image, we can see that this ailing PC once proudly brandished the Digital Storm marque. That firm claims to build PCs with “expert craftsmanship,” and is committed to “crafting the world’s most advanced gaming PCs.” It also offers lifetime support - so the PSU shroud-mangler should have reached for the phone before reaching for the bolt cutters, or whatever inappropriate tool did this damage.</p><p>We’d guess that the GPU pictured is an Asus Dual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">GeForce RTX 3060</a>, possibly an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-asus-dual">RTX 4060</a>. That means, if this PC originally shipped with the GPU, it was put together around four or fewer years ago. Dust buildup looks like a few years' worth, too.</p><p>Some Redditors can’t help but comment on the 256GB SATA drive we see mounted on the PSU shroud area. We’d like to think this is an old drive brought along from a prior PC, not the primary, as it lacks capacity and performance if the PC is meant for gaming duties in 2025.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">has announced</a> a new price increase for its Xbox Series X and S consoles coming on October 3, a scant five months after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/xbox/microsoft-hikes-prices-of-xbox-consoles-controllers-headsets-and-games-worldwide-cites-market-conditions-and-price-of-development">previous hike in May</a>. The already-pricey Xbox Series X now commands $649.99, the Series S goes for $399.99 (with 512 GB of storage), and the capacious Series X 2 TB Galaxy Black Special Edition has a price tag as long as its name, at $799.99.</p><p>However, this time around, things are a little different. The sting is pointed only at U.S. customers, and mercifully covers only the consoles. This is in contrast to the May increase, when Microsoft raised prices on its console wares across the board, including accessories and games, and applied them worldwide.</p><div ><table><caption>Revised Xbox Series U.S. pricing</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th

><p>$70</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Predictably, Microsoft pins the blame for the increase on "changes in the macroeconomics environment", corporate-speak that likely means tariffs. While that might be a decent justification in of itself, some would argue that it's a lack of forethought and/or poor optics to have price increases twice in the same year for similar reasons.</p><p>Microsoft might be simply following the market on the heels of Sony, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/sony-hikes-ps5-prices-by-usd50-starting-tomorrow-sony-adds-up-to-10-percent-to-the-price-of-every-model-from-august-21">raised prices</a> for its PlayStation 5 lineup by $50 roughly a month ago. As it stands, the standard PlayStation 5 currently sits at $549.99, undercutting the Xbox Series X by a solid $100. That's quite the bitter pill for prospective Halo gamers to swallow, and just like Microsoft's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-follows-nvidias-lead-surpasses-usd4-trillion-market-capitalization-on-soaring-demand-for-cloud-services-multi-front-ai-endeavors">Q4 revenue</a>, it's more than a little rich in light of PlayStation having a lion's share of the market.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, the time is ripe for affordable PCs, and some napkin math puts a machine equal or better to the Xbox Series X at around the $600 mark, give or take, as pricing winds allow. Given how hard Microsoft is pushing its cross-platform Xbox Game Pass, it's become harder still to justify the price of a Series X.</p><p>Back in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">Sony reported</a> that it had sold 80.3 million PlayStation 5 consoles.

Simple math would put the Xbox Series offerings at over 27 million.</p><p>Considering the elapsed time since then and assuming a very generous 30 million, that works out to 62.6% versus 37.3% for Sony. Good thing Microsoft's services are raking in cash hand over fist.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ OpenAI is reportedly poaching Apple talent to build its first consumer hardware device — could potentially be a smart speaker ]]>
<p>OpenAI has signed a manufacturing agreement with Luxshare to build its first consumer hardware product, according to a new report from<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-raids-apple-hardware-talent-manufacturing-partners"><em>The Information</em></a>. The device — described by suppliers as something that resembles a screenless smart speaker (in other words, an Alexa-adjacent device) — is part of a broader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-confirms-he-is-working-on-an-openai-hardware-design-project">push into hardware</a> that also includes exploratory work on glasses, a wearable pin, and a digital voice recorder. Sources familiar with the roadmap say OpenAI is targeting a late 2026 or early 2027 launch window.</p><p>Luxshare isn't the only Apple supplier involved. Goertek, which builds AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watch components, has been approached to provide speaker modules for OpenAI's first product. The company is also said to be engaging with other Chinese supply chain partners Apple has spent years cultivating, including those in tooling and precision audio.</p><p>According to <em>The Register</em>, the hardware project is being led by Tang Tan, who left Apple in 2023 after a 25-year tenure that included design oversight of various flagship products. Tan now serves as OpenAI's chief hardware officer and reports directly to CEO Sam Altman. In May, OpenAI acquired io Products — the hardware design studio Tan co-founded with Jony Ive — in a $6.5 billion deal backed by SoftBank. Court documents from an ongoing trademark dispute describe OpenAI's goal as building a family of AI-native products under the io brand.</p><p>Since the io acquisition, OpenAI has stepped up recruiting across Apple's product and operations teams. At least 25 former Apple employees are understood to have joined the effort in 2025 alone, with backgrounds in human interface design, audio, wearables, and manufacturing scale-up. Among them are senior figures like Cyrus Daniel Irani, a longtime Siri interface designer, and Matt Theobald, who spent 17 years on Apple's manufacturing design team. Others include engineers from Apple's camera and Watch divisions. Most hires have joined Tan's org inside OpenAI, though some remain associated with LoveFrom, Ive's separate design firm.</p><p>The poaching of talent could complicate the company's relationship with Apple, which, since 2024, has integrated OpenAI's models into Siri and iOS. That partnership now runs parallel to a hardware effort built by Apple's own former talent and vendors.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ How often should you expect to replace your headset, keyboard, or mouse — buying tips for picking longer-lasting gear ]]>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, my colleague Matt Safford showed up to our morning meeting wearing half a headset. "Guess what," he announced. "My headset — the one that I <em>only </em>use for these meetings — just snapped in half. While I was wearing it."</p><p>I asked if he'd been putting it on, or fiddling with the adjustments, and he confirmed that he wasn't touching it — it was on his head and it suddenly felt loose, and when he reached up to see what was going on, he discovered it was in two pieces. RIP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/razer-barracuda-pro"><u>Razer Barracuda Pro</u></a> — the included rigid carrying case isn't quite as much of a benefit if the headset is so fragile it's going to snap in half while it's being used exactly as intended.</p><p>This isn't the first time one of us has shown up to the morning meeting in need of a new peripheral, whether it's a headset, keyboard, mouse, or, I don't know... a chair or a desk. And peripherals, especially gaming peripherals, aren't meant to last forever — they wear out (even if you're not a gamer who's prone to fits of rage), physically, and they become dated, technologically. At the rate gaming companies update their lineups, it seems like you should be shopping for new accessories every 2 - 3 years. Of course, gaming companies want to sell you stuff, so that's not a great way to estimate the expected lifespan of your gear.</p><p>But you might be wondering just how long your peripherals <em>should </em>last, assuming you're not a competitive eSports athlete or a gaming peripherals editor.</p><h2 id="headsets-2">Headsets</h2><p>Matt's Razer Barracuda lasted about 2.5 years, which is definitely shorter than you should expect a gaming headset to last (and you shouldn't expect any gaming headset to snap at the hinge while you're just... wearing it). But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/best-gaming-headsets"><u>best gaming headsets</u></a> won't necessarily last forever, depending on a few factors.</p><p>Wireless headsets tend to lose their steam faster because the battery degrades — but you should still be able to get a solid 3 - 4 years out of a wireless headset, if not longer. Wired headsets can last significantly longer if they're well-built, but most gaming headsets are... not that well-built. Still, a decent wired headset should get you a solid 5 - 6 years of use — longer if it has replaceable parts.</p><p>Here's what you should look for if you're looking for a headset that won't snap in half:</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The only gripe? The earpads, which are leatherette-covered memory foam, wear out fairly quickly and are difficult to replace — mostly because Corsair didn't sell them for a long time (though I believe they do, now). Earpads tend to wear out after 1 - 2 years of regular use (or sooner, depending on what they're made of and whether you sweat), so you should look for a gaming headset with replaceable earpads. Some gaming headsets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/logitech-g-pro-x-2-lightspeed-review"><u>Logitech's G Pro X 2 Lightspeed</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/asus-rog-delta-ii-review"><u>Asus' ROG Delta II</u></a>, even come with alternate / replacement earpads in the box.</p><div class="inlinegallery

But aluminum keyboards tend to be better built overall and better able to handle aggressive typing or gaming.</p><h2 id="mice-2">Mice</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-gaming-mouse"><u>Gaming mice</u></a> tend to follow a pretty regular update cycle of about 1.5 - 2.5 years, and this is the one category where the update cycle isn't a terrible indicator of expected lifespan. Your mouse gets a lot more wear than your keyboard does, because it has significantly fewer buttons and it's always moving. (Also, if you are the type of gamer who gets heated, your mouse is probably the easiest thing to slam down on your desk or throw across the room.) Mouse switches and keyboard switches have similar click ratings, but you'll reach that number a lot quicker when you only have two buttons to choose from instead of 88 or 104 (or however many keys there are on your keyboard). That said, while updating your mouse every 2 - 3 years isn't crazy, you should still be able to stretch a gaming mouse's lifespan to 3 - 4 years as long as you're not excessively slamming or squeezing it.</p><p>But you still want your gaming mouse to last the full 2 - 3 years, so here's what to look for:</p><p><strong>Solid build: </strong>This might seem like a no-brainer, but it's still worth mentioning — if you want your mouse to last, it needs to be well-built and sturdy-feeling right out of the box. If the sides are flexing or creaking, or the scroll wheel feels indecisive, or the switches are mushy... it only gets worse, not better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

If you're shopping for a wired mouse, look for one with a lightweight, flexible, drag-free paracord cable, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/hyperx-pulsefire-haste-2-its-fine-but-thats-it"><u>HyperX's Pulsefire Haste 2</u></a>, or one that has a detachable cable — like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steelseries-aerox-3"><u>SteelSeries' Aerox</u></a> series.</p><p><strong>Onboard memory: </strong>You probably do want a gaming mouse that's at least somewhat customizable, so you can adjust DPI steps and tweak various settings to calibrate the feel perfectly. But once that's set up, you're probably going to go back in and readjust things... never. While the execution of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-mice/cherry-xtrfy-m64-pro-wireless-mouse-review"><u>Cherry Xtrfy M64 Pro's</u></a> plug-and-play isn't perfect, the idea isn't a bad one — nobody wants a mouse that's forever tied to some clunky peripheral software that stops working whenever you actually try to use it. If you want your mouse to last through Synapse's 243 yearly updates, make sure it has several onboard profiles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Splurging on a pricey gaming mouse made of carbon fiber or, I don't know, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/razer-showcases-24k-gold-viper-signature-mini-gaming-mouse"><u><em>gold</em></u></a><em> </em>isn't going to get you nearly as far as it will in other categories.</p><p>Of course, not all peripherals need regular updates.
