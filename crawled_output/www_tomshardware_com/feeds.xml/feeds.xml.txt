<![CDATA[ AMD relaunches $40 dual-core Athlon 3000G CPU with new packaging and cooler — Zen refuses to retire even in 2025 ]]>
<p>It has become common practice for AMD and Intel to re-release processors from several generations-old architectures. Japanese news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/news/2047992.html">Akiba</a> reports that AMD has relaunched its entry-level dual-core Athlon 3000G with new packaging and a cooler, featuring part number YD3000C6FHSBX. The chip is on sale for ¥5,790, which translates to approximately $40.</p><p>The Athlon 3000G is one of the slowest CPUs you can install in an AM4 motherboard. The CPU was released in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-unveils-threadripper-3960x-and-3970x-ryzen-9-3950x-details-and-athlon-3000g/3">2019</a> as AMD's entry-level processor, succeeding the Athlon 200GE series that preceded it. The chip has two unlocked Zen CPU cores, four threads, just 4MB of L3 cache, a 35W TDP, and a 3.5 GHz clock speed. For graphics, the 3000G comes with a Vega 3-based iGPU featuring three CUs, 192 cores, and a 1.1GHz clock speed.</p><p>AMD launched a second variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-continues-to-sell-14nm-zen-cpus-in-2023">chip in 2023</a>, featuring a beefier Wraith cooler, new packaging, and a newer die based on the Dali architecture. Dali was an offshoot of Raven Ridge that was cheaper to manufacture, but based on the same 14nm process. As a result, performance is identical between the original and refreshed versions. One interesting tidbit about the Dali die is that it only features two physical cores; by contrast, the original Raven Ridge version of the 3000G had a quad-core die with two disabled cores.</p><p>The latest re-release is unsurprisingly based on the newer Dali version of the Athlon 3000G. The aforementioned part number (YD3000C6FHSBX) confirms this. Models with the letters "FH" included signify that they are the newer models; by contrast, part numbers including "FB" represent the original models.</p><p>It may seem silly for AMD to release an entry-level CPU that is now six years old, running on an architecture introduced eight years ago. But AMD would not release a CPU like this unless it knew there was still a market for it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-launches-a-budget-gaming-beast-ryzen-5-5500x3d-arrives-for-the-latin-american-market">Ryzen 5 5500X3D</a> is an excellent example of this being an "all-new" Ryzen CPU based on the Zen 3 architecture, but it is region-locked to Latin America. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-launches-four-new-ryzen-cpus-including-cutdown-zen-4-and-zen-3-models-most-only-available-in-global-markets">Ryzen 5 5600F and Ryzen 5 7400</a> are similar, both being locked to the Asian market.</p><p>Intel is also no stranger to this strategy; it recently released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-14nm-desktop-cpus-are-making-a-comeback-chipmaker-inexplicably-resurrects-comet-lake-from-five-years-ago-with-new-core-i5-110">Core i5-110</a>, based on its Comet Lake 14nm architecture, an architecture that debuted five years ago in chips such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-10900k-cpu-review">Core i9-10900K</a>.</p><p>The only caveat owners will need to be aware of is motherboard compatibility for the 3000G. The chip is so old that AMD's latest iteration of 500-series AM5 motherboards doesn't support it. Technically, these boards can help, but AMD has released so many AM4 CPUs over the past eight years that there likely isn't enough room in the firmware memory of 500-series motherboards to accommodate such old chips.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ ‘Proper next-gen Amiga’ launched by Apollo Computing — promises full FPGA-powered backwards compatibility with its new 68080 chip ]]>
<p>Apollo Computing stepped forward to reveal its “Proper next-gen Amiga” to the masses earlier this week. The German firm has unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a6000.net/">Apollo A6000</a>, a comprehensive modern Amiga system featuring advanced technologies, including a “cutting-edge V4 AC68080” FPGA, which makes it the “most powerful Amiga 68k compatible ever created.”</p><p>Moreover, the Apollo A6000 retains the cutesy retro styling of the Amiga A600 (probably that machine’s best feature), enhanced by eye-popping tech specs and a built-in mechanical keyboard.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNGrgfX5bqc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Vintage Amigans may best remember Apollo for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-emulates-amiga-1200-uses-real-floppy-disks">Amiga A1200</a> trapdoor accelerators, and more recently for Vampire FPGA accelerator boards for a host of legacy Commodore machines. While building up its expertise in the vintage-to-modern FPGA technology arena over the last decade, it appears to have finally reached the milestone of this fully remastered machine, which dovetails with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/original-amiga-prototype-spotted-at-vcf-west-2025-vintage-computing-show-rarely-seen-forerunner-to-amiga-1000-from-early-1984">40<sup>th</sup> anniversary</a> of the Amiga.</p><p>So, what is the Apollo A6000?

<![CDATA[ Microsoft Gaming Copilot hits Windows in public beta — in-game AI overlay goes live for PC players ]]>
<p>Microsoft began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/09/19/gaming-copilot-beta-coming-to-windows-pc/">rolling out its new Gaming Copilot assistant</a> to Windows users as part of a public beta on September 19, following a previous rollout to Xbox Insiders in August. The feature, located within the Xbox Game Bar overlay, provides players with real-time in-game support using AI-driven context from their screen and Xbox account.</p><p>Unlike past versions of Copilot integrated into Windows or Microsoft 365, Gaming Copilot is built with screen context and real-time game awareness. It reads from your Xbox account history, sees what you’re playing, and can analyze screen content on demand to answer in-game questions. Microsoft says it’s designed to help players find achievements, plan builds, and navigate quests without needing to alt-tab to wikis or YouTube.</p><p>On paper, Gaming Copilot resembles third-party tools like Overwolf, but it operates at the system level within the Game Bar overlay, which provides more reliable full-screen behavior and compatibility with DirectX titles. Microsoft has also confirmed that the assistant can be pinned as a widget and activated with push-to-talk voice controls, two features already present in this early beta.</p><p>The company has not disclosed whether any of the Copilot inference runs locally or if it’s entirely cloud-based. There is also no mention of NPU acceleration, which would matter for players using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-last-15-hours-on-our-battery-test-but-intel-systems-not-that-far-behind">Snapdragon X</a> laptops or hybrid-core CPUs with on-device AI blocks. This will be a key testing point, particularly as Microsoft has framed the Copilot experience as optimized for new handhelds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/microsofts-new-handheld-gaming-mode-exclusive-to-rog-xbox-ally-has-just-leaked-for-every-handheld-running-windows-11-all-you-need-is-the-25h2-update-and-a-few-registry-tweaks">ROG Ally X</a>.</p><p>Anti-cheat compatibility is another open question. Vendors like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye generally whitelist Game Bar itself, but Copilot is a more complex overlay, and Microsoft hasn’t clarified whether any specific protections are in place. With real-time screenshot analysis and persistent widgets, it’s not clear how Copilot will behave in titles with aggressive DRM or competitive match enforcement.</p><p>With the release of Gaming Copilot, Microsoft appears to be making a concerted effort to make Windows feel more like a native gaming platform. Just days before the Copilot rollout, the company updated the Xbox app to serve as a unified launcher that aggregates titles from Steam, Epic, GOG, and others. Together, these changes transform Windows from a passive host OS to an active participant in the gaming experience.</p><p>Gaming Copilot is now available for players aged 18 and older, in all regions except mainland China.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Asus TUF Gaming F16 review: Strong gaming performance offset by skimpy SSD, short battery life ]]>
<p>If you’re looking to enjoy some 1080p gaming without shelling out a lot of money, we had the chance to review the new Asus TUF Gaming F16 gaming laptop. It uses Nvidia’s entry-level RTX 5050 GPU with an added twist. While some laptops have opted for a higher-tier RTX 5060 with lower TDPs, the TUF Gaming F16 is packing a potent 115-watt RTX 5050 that helps to level the playing field for gaming.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 is an imposing laptop thanks to its 16-inch frame, and it manages to incorporate a generous assortment of ports, an RGB keyboard, a numberpad, and a 165 Hz IPS display. Given its as-tested MSRP of $1,199, the TUF Gaming F16 offers strong performance, but that comes with a couple of caveats.</p><h2 id="design-of-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Design of the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>One word can be used to describe the TUF Gaming F16's design: understated. While the TUF Gaming F16 is first and foremost a gaming machine, it features a clean exterior, finished in black and light grey. The aluminum lid is minimalistic, with just the letters "TUF" and the accompanying logo embossed in the top corner.</p><p>There are some interesting touches, including the rear exhaust panel with triangle- and rhombus-shaped cutouts. There's also a nifty four-leaf status LED at the top of the rear deck (behind the display) – it blinks to signify power status, drive access, etc.</p><div class="inlinegallery

At the native 1200p resolution with the Ultra preset, I averaged around 90 frames per second (FPS) through most scenes in the game. Heavy action on-screen caused the frame rates to dip to the 70 FPS range, but the play experience was generally excellent.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

For comparison, the RTX 5060 in the Nitro V 16S AI has a TGP of just 85 watts, while the 16 Aurora’s RTX 5060 has an 80-watt TGP. The advantage in available TGP plays highly in the TUF Gaming F16’s favor in gaming benchmarks, even though the RTX 5060 used in the two competing laptops is technically a more powerful chip.</p><p>Taking a look at <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> (Highest settings), the TUF Gaming F16 delivered 95 FPS at 1080p and 90 FPS at 1200p. Those numbers weren’t too far off the pace of the Nitro V 16S AI, which hit 98 FPS at 1080p and 91 FPS at 1200p. The 16 Aurora was one frame per second faster at 1080p.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The Nitro V 16S AI achieved 32 FPS at 1080p and 27 FPS at 1200p, which was actually just behind the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p><em>Far Cry 6</em> (Ultra settings) saw the TUF Gaming F16 push its way to the front of the pack, with 90 FPS at 1080p and 86 FPS at 1200p — the Nitro V 16S AI well behind, at 82 FPS and 79 FPS, respectively. The 16 Aurora pulled up the rear (not by much), with 81 FPS at 1080p.</p><p>It was another three-way race in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (Medium settings), with our review unit easily keeping up with the other two competitors. The TUF Gaming F16 and Nitro V 16S AI scored identically, with 68 FPS at 1080p and 64 FPS at 1200p.</p><p>Finally, the <em>Borderlands 3</em> benchmark (Badass settings), saw the TUF Gaming F16 hit 81 FPS at 1080p and 75 FPS at 1200p, compared to 82 FPS and 81 FPS, respectively, for the Nitro V 16S AI. The 16 Aurora was the leader at 1080p with 83 FPS.</p><p>The overall sentiment here is that despite being a lower-level SKU in the RTX 50 Series, Asus’ implementation of the RTX 5050 with a 115W TGP and a 2,092 MHz max boost clock allows it to remain competitive with the TGP-capped RTX 5060 competition.</p><p><em>Metro Exodus</em> remains our go-to benchmark for gaming laptop stress testing. Our review unit averaged 65.62 FPS at 1080p across 15 loops using the RTX benchmark preset. The CPU performance cores averaged 3.0 GHz, and the efficiency cores averaged 2.53 GHz. The RTX 5060 GPU also ran at 2.53 GHz.</p><h2 id="productivity-performance-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Productivity Performance on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Our review unit has a Core i7-14650HX "Raptor Lake" processor, which has 8 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. That processor is paired with just 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, instead of the 32GB found on the competing laptops (while the Aurora was far more expensive as tested, the Acer was $100 more). SSD storage is also a bit on the stingy side at 512GB, which doesn’t leave a lot of space for games after you take into account the standard Windows 11 Home install.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 started strong in the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, achieving a single-core score of 2,710 and a multi-core score of 15,013. That performance put it slightly ahead of the Acer (Ryzen 7 260) and Alienware (Core i7-240H) contenders in single-core, with a healthier margin of victory for multi-core.</p><div class="inlinegallery

In our test, the SSD only managed 775.5 MBps compared to 1,170.12 MB/s for the 16 Aurora. The Nitro V 16S AI left our review unit in the dust, more than doubling its results (1,838.88 MBps). Going with a 512GB SSD was already painful, but the lagging performance just adds insult to injury. In the real world, I noticed some sluggishness when installing games onto the SSD.</p><p>Our Handbrake benchmark involves transcoding a 4K video file to 1080p. The TUF Gaming F16 completed the task in 3 minutes and 33 seconds, easily dispatching the other two systems. The Nitro V 16S AI took nearly a minute longer to complete the transcode (4 minutes and 32 seconds).</p><h2 id="display-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Display on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Like many mainstream gaming laptops, Asus has adopted a 16:10 aspect ratio for the TUF Gaming F16’s display, meaning that you get a 1920 x 1200 resolution. An IPS panel is employed here, accompanied by a relatively brisk 165 Hz refresh rate. An anti-reflective layer is used on the display.</p><p>Compared to the Nitro V 16S AI and 16 Aurora, the TUF Gaming F16 comes up short in overall panel brightness — at least on paper. We measured 298.4 nits compared to 312.2 for the 16 Aurora and 391.8 nits for the Nitro V 16S AI. However, in the real world, I never felt wanting for
additional brightnessin an indoor setting. The screen did wash out a little when using the laptop outside on a partly cloudy day, but it was still usable without straining with the brightness maxed out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

In practice, there was little to complain about with respect to how colors were represented on the display. The anti-reflective coating might blunt colors just a tad compared to a glossy finish, but everything that I threw at the TUF Gaming F16 looked great. I spent a few hours toiling around in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and came away impressed with how gorgeous the varying environments were.</p><p>I also watched a few episodes of my new favorite TV show, <em>The Pitt</em>, on the display. Unlike some previous medical dramas, which lean heavily on unrealistic darkened set design to create a certain mood, <em>The Pitt</em> is bathed in the stark bright lights of a typical hospital. There's nowhere to hide under these illuminating conditions. From the various colors of the scrubs worn by nurses, interns, and doctors, to their lifelike gushes of blood (and other bodily fluids) that shoot across the screen, I felt fully immersed in the frantic emergency room environment.</p><h2 id="keyboard-and-touchpad-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Keyboard and Touchpad on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>The TUF Gaming F16 uses a full-size keyboard plus a dedicated numberpad. The keys have 1.7 mm of travel and are adequately spaced to occupy as much of the width afforded by the 16-inch frame as possible. While the majority of the keys feature black keycaps, the WASD keys are clear, which allows more of the RGB coloring to shine through when enabled.</p><p>Speaking of RGB, the TUF Gaming F16 uses a single-zone RGB setup (compared to four zones for the Acer) that can be configured with the Armory Crate app. You can also quickly change Aura Effects using the Fn + F4 key combination.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The surface also provides a satisfying click.</p><h2 id="audio-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Audio on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>The TUF Gaming F16 only comes with two speakers, but they are punching well above their weight when it comes to performance. The speakers are loud, clear, and equally adept at producing remarkable sound in games, movies, TV shows, and music.</p><p>Playing <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, I could hear the distinct sounds of boots hitting metal ladders as I climbed them, the audible grunts pulling myself up to a platform, the “glug glug” of pouring a bottle of wine, and the crack of Indy’s iconic whip. Of course, this was with the volume raised to about 30% to overpower the laptop’s twin cooling fans.</p><p>I also took the time to slink into the melodic tranquility of “Mujahedin and Opium,” a John Barry track from the James Bond film, <em>The Living Daylights</em>. The song is a perfect mix of percussion, strings, and soaring brass that gives it a majestic quality (and is probably one of my favorite pieces in the lengthy catalog of James Bond soundtracks). I felt that the TUF Gaming F16 captured the raw essence of the piece, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that I might have played the song on repeat a dozen times or so.</p><h2 id="upgradeability-of-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Upgradeability of the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Eleven Phillips head screws affix the bottom panel to the TUF Gaming F16’s main chassis.

However, the results weren’t as promising as I would have hoped. While the overall resolution seemed slightly better than the 720p webcams I’ve recently encountered, the colors were somewhat washed out and not as well saturated. My skin typically appears brown in webcams, but it looks a bit greyer on the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p>Overall, the webcam was just adequate, and I wouldn’t chalk it up as being anywhere near the top of its class.

The most prominent app is Armory Crate, which is Asus’s all-in-one utility that monitors everything from CPU/Memory/GPU/Fan status to performance modes. Armory Crate is also where you’ll find controls for the Aura RGB effects on the keyboard. The Game Library features can also keep track of and allow you to set performance profiles on a per-game basis.</p><p>Other installed apps include MyAsus, which has system diagnostics capabilities, can assist with system updates, and allows you to get in contact with Asus customer support. There’s also the CapCut video editor, Dolby Access for switching audio profiles, and GlideX, which allows you to share screen access across multiple devices (i.e., a laptop, smartphone, and tablet).</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 comes with a one-year warranty.</p><h2 id="asus-tuf-gaming-f16-configurations-2">Asus TUF Gaming F16 Configurations</h2><p>Our review unit is the TUF Gaming F16 (FX608J), which features a Core i7-14650HX processor, 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, a 512GB SSD, a GeForce RTX 5050 GPU, and a 16-inch 165 Hz 1200p IPS display.

While you could upgrade this system to fix these problems, that would be easier to swallow at a $999 price point.</p><p>Battery life was also just average, with the TUF Gaming F16 lasting just under 7 hours compared to over 10 hours for the Acer Nitro V 16S AI.</p><p>In my opinion, the Nitro V 16S AI is the better overall laptop, boasting far superior battery life, comparable gaming performance, twice the storage space, and twice the RAM. It’ll cost you $100 more, but it’s well worth the extra coin.</p>

<![CDATA[ Borderlands 4 props come to 3D printing fans — Ripper mask, replica weapons, and cosplay components come in a new collection from Prusa Research ]]>
<p>On the day <em>Borderlands 4</em> hit shelves, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prusa3d.com/article/borderlands-4-and-prusa-research-partner-for-free-launch-day-3d-printable-cosplay-models_243355/">Prusa</a> and developer Gearbox Software published a library of official models on Printables.com that has seen over 20,000 downloads in the first week. The collection includes the franchise’s iconic Psycho mask, a variety of replica weapons, and detailed cosplay components — all verified and test-printed on Prusa 3D printers.</p><p>It’s not unusual to find creators on YouTube showing off fan art and cosplay pieces inspired by video games and movies. However, lately, the studios have been getting directly involved in the process. Adam Savage’s <em>Tested</em> worked with Bethesda to first create, then release, a printable <em>Frontier </em>model from <em>Starfield</em>. Joel Telling, AKA the 3D Printing Nerd, collaborated with Paramount on a massive Optimus Primal model to promote <em>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</em>. That model, along with an Optimus Primal flexi, was released for free on Printables and was downloaded thousands of times by fans. These projects gave makers official 3D files, tutorials, and build videos that blurred the line between studio content and maker culture.</p><p>Now, Prusa Research is stepping into that role directly. The Czech 3D-printer company is forging partnerships with both entertainment studios and global brands to provide makers with officially licensed 3D files that are both fun and practical.</p><p>“I love when the line between digital and physical blurs,” said Josef Průša, founder and CEO of Prusa Research. “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/is-borderlands-4-the-new-crysis-official-gpu-setting-recommendations-peg-4k-performance-with-the-rtx-5090-at-60-fps-with-dlss-and-frame-generation-enabled"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches, and on the same day you can already have a Ripper mask sitting on your desk. That’s just awesome. Usually, props like this take weeks of work to design from scratch. Now it’s literally: click, print, and a piece of Borderlands is in your hands.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Earlier this year, Prusa added models from <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> by CD Projekt RED, providing cosplayers with accurate files for props and costume parts. The site also hosts licensed files from Czech titles such as <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and Bohemia Interactive’s <em>Arma</em> and <em>DayZ</em>.</p><p>Prusa isn’t stopping with games. The company has also courted major tech brands, encouraging them to release 3D-printable accessories, mods, and replacement parts directly to the Printables maker community. Collaborations have included custom PC cases from Corsair, Noctua fan ducts, and combs to fit Phillips electric razors.</p><p>These projects are part of a broader strategy by Prusa to position 3D printing as a bridge between brands and their customers – at least the ones with 3D printers. By offering free, studio-approved files, companies can engage players and consumers in a way that feels both collectible and creative. Cosplayers gain reliable, detailed models, while hobbyists enjoy high-quality parts without the guesswork of reverse-engineering from screenshots.</p><p>With Printables.com serving as a central hub, official models don’t need to be scattered across fan forums or buried in unverified repositories. Though Printables is part of the Prusa Research family, their website and slicers are open to makers with any brand of 3D printer.</p><p>For Prusa, this is just the beginning. The company says it plans to expand its portfolio of partnerships and may even host design competitions tied to popular brands. With the arrival of <em>Borderlands 4</em> files, it’s easy to imagine a future where launch-day exclusives aren’t just posters or skins, but STL or 3MF files that fans can bring to life on their printers.</p><p>As digital content increasingly overlaps with physical fandom, Prusa’s collaborations suggest that branded 3D printing may become as common as DLC or limited-edition merch, except this time, you get to manufacture it yourself at home.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Repairer brands customer’s gaming PC a ‘monstrosity’ — skin lacerating cable management technique provokes horror ]]>
<p>A PC repair professional was sent in a system to fix that had some unusual, and possibly hazardous, modifications. Redditor and repair shop owner, elishalewisusaf, didn’t shy away from branding the stricken PC a “monstrosity.” Indeed, the PSU shroud looks like it was ripped open by a xenomorph, breaking through the perforated steel venting to protect its hive.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"
><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1njkgpg/i_own_a_tech_repair_business_and_this_monstrosity">I own a tech repair business - and this monstrosity came in. I’m baffled</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace">r/pcmasterrace</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Commenters in the PCMR Reddit thread are largely puzzled as to ‘why’ such a heinous act has been carried out on this PC. The PSU shroud already featured a modestly sized cutout for cable routing, just below the xenomorph breach zone. Indeed, elishalewisusaf is also “baffled” by what they saw when this PC arrived in the repair shop.</p><p>The assembled social media-based PC building experts generally opine that the twisted metal surgery this PC has undergone, presumably by the owner, is user error, to put it politely. However, some are charitable enough to suggest the 8-pin cable from PSU to GPU may have been too short to take a more scenic route. That would mean it was an unusually short cable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

So, we don’t know if the twisted metal mess between the PSU zone and the rest of the PC actually caused a functional problem. It would not be surprising if some of the cabling we can’t see is damaged or shorting, due to metal shards or dust.</p><h2 id="once-a-proud-pc-system-2">Once a proud PC system</h2><p>Also in the image, we can see that this ailing PC once proudly brandished the Digital Storm marque. That firm claims to build PCs with “expert craftsmanship,” and is committed to “crafting the world’s most advanced gaming PCs.” It also offers lifetime support - so the PSU shroud-mangler should have reached for the phone before reaching for the bolt cutters, or whatever inappropriate tool did this damage.</p><p>We’d guess that the GPU pictured is an Asus Dual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">GeForce RTX 3060</a>, possibly an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-asus-dual">RTX 4060</a>. That means, if this PC originally shipped with the GPU, it was put together around four or fewer years ago. Dust buildup looks like a few years' worth, too.</p><p>Some Redditors can’t help but comment on the 256GB SATA drive we see mounted on the PSU shroud area. We’d like to think this is an old drive brought along from a prior PC, not the primary, as it lacks capacity and performance if the PC is meant for gaming duties in 2025.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Microsoft hikes Xbox Series X price, again, to $649 — second price increase of 2025 comes as shifting tariffs continue to plague tech prices ]]>
<p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">has announced</a> a new price increase for its Xbox Series X and S consoles coming on October 3, a scant five months after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/xbox/microsoft-hikes-prices-of-xbox-consoles-controllers-headsets-and-games-worldwide-cites-market-conditions-and-price-of-development">previous hike in May</a>. The already-pricey Xbox Series X now commands $649.99, the Series S goes for $399.99 (with 512 GB of storage), and the capacious Series X 2 TB Galaxy Black Special Edition has a price tag as long as its name, at $799.99.</p><p>However, this time around, things are a little different. The sting is pointed only at U.S. customers, and mercifully covers only the consoles. This is in contrast to the May increase, when Microsoft raised prices on its console wares across the board, including accessories and games, and applied them worldwide.</p><div ><table><caption>Revised Xbox Series U.S. pricing</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th

><p>$729.99</p></td><td
><p>$70</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Predictably, Microsoft pins the blame for the increase on "changes in the macroeconomics environment", corporate-speak that likely means tariffs. While that might be a decent justification in of itself, some would argue that it's a lack of forethought and/or poor optics to have price increases twice in the same year for similar reasons.</p><p>Microsoft might be simply following the market on the heels of Sony, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/sony-hikes-ps5-prices-by-usd50-starting-tomorrow-sony-adds-up-to-10-percent-to-the-price-of-every-model-from-august-21">raised prices</a> for its PlayStation 5 lineup by $50 roughly a month ago. As it stands, the standard PlayStation 5 currently sits at $549.99, undercutting the Xbox Series X by a solid $100. That's quite the bitter pill for prospective Halo gamers to swallow, and just like Microsoft's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-follows-nvidias-lead-surpasses-usd4-trillion-market-capitalization-on-soaring-demand-for-cloud-services-multi-front-ai-endeavors">Q4 revenue</a>, it's more than a little rich in light of PlayStation having a lion's share of the market.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, the time is ripe for affordable PCs, and some napkin math puts a machine equal or better to the Xbox Series X at around the $600 mark, give or take, as pricing winds allow. Given how hard Microsoft is pushing its cross-platform Xbox Game Pass, it's become harder still to justify the price of a Series X.</p><p>Back in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">Sony reported</a> that it had sold 80.3 million PlayStation 5 consoles.

Simple math would put the Xbox Series offerings at over 27 million.</p><p>Considering the elapsed time since then and assuming a very generous 30 million, that works out to 62.6% versus 37.3% for Sony. Good thing Microsoft's services are raking in cash hand over fist.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ OpenAI is reportedly poaching Apple talent to build its first consumer hardware device — could potentially be a smart speaker ]]>
<p>OpenAI has signed a manufacturing agreement with Luxshare to build its first consumer hardware product, according to a new report from<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-raids-apple-hardware-talent-manufacturing-partners"><em>The Information</em></a>. The device — described by suppliers as something that resembles a screenless smart speaker (in other words, an Alexa-adjacent device) — is part of a broader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-confirms-he-is-working-on-an-openai-hardware-design-project">push into hardware</a> that also includes exploratory work on glasses, a wearable pin, and a digital voice recorder. Sources familiar with the roadmap say OpenAI is targeting a late 2026 or early 2027 launch window.</p><p>Luxshare isn't the only Apple supplier involved. Goertek, which builds AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watch components, has been approached to provide speaker modules for OpenAI's first product. The company is also said to be engaging with other Chinese supply chain partners Apple has spent years cultivating, including those in tooling and precision audio.</p><p>According to <em>The Register</em>, the hardware project is being led by Tang Tan, who left Apple in 2023 after a 25-year tenure that included design oversight of various flagship products. Tan now serves as OpenAI's chief hardware officer and reports directly to CEO Sam Altman. In May, OpenAI acquired io Products — the hardware design studio Tan co-founded with Jony Ive — in a $6.5 billion deal backed by SoftBank. Court documents from an ongoing trademark dispute describe OpenAI's goal as building a family of AI-native products under the io brand.</p><p>Since the io acquisition, OpenAI has stepped up recruiting across Apple's product and operations teams. At least 25 former Apple employees are understood to have joined the effort in 2025 alone, with backgrounds in human interface design, audio, wearables, and manufacturing scale-up. Among them are senior figures like Cyrus Daniel Irani, a longtime Siri interface designer, and Matt Theobald, who spent 17 years on Apple's manufacturing design team. Others include engineers from Apple's camera and Watch divisions. Most hires have joined Tan's org inside OpenAI, though some remain associated with LoveFrom, Ive's separate design firm.</p><p>The poaching of talent could complicate the company's relationship with Apple, which, since 2024, has integrated OpenAI's models into Siri and iOS. That partnership now runs parallel to a hardware effort built by Apple's own former talent and vendors.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ How often should you expect to replace your headset, keyboard, or mouse — buying tips for picking longer-lasting gear ]]>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, my colleague Matt Safford showed up to our morning meeting wearing half a headset. "Guess what," he announced. "My headset — the one that I <em>only </em>use for these meetings — just snapped in half. While I was wearing it."</p><p>I asked if he'd been putting it on, or fiddling with the adjustments, and he confirmed that he wasn't touching it — it was on his head and it suddenly felt loose, and when he reached up to see what was going on, he discovered it was in two pieces. RIP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/razer-barracuda-pro"><u>Razer Barracuda Pro</u></a> — the included rigid carrying case isn't quite as much of a benefit if the headset is so fragile it's going to snap in half while it's being used exactly as intended.</p><p>This isn't the first time one of us has shown up to the morning meeting in need of a new peripheral, whether it's a headset, keyboard, mouse, or, I don't know... a chair or a desk. And peripherals, especially gaming peripherals, aren't meant to last forever — they wear out (even if you're not a gamer who's prone to fits of rage), physically, and they become dated, technologically. At the rate gaming companies update their lineups, it seems like you should be shopping for new accessories every 2 - 3 years. Of course, gaming companies want to sell you stuff, so that's not a great way to estimate the expected lifespan of your gear.</p><p>But you might be wondering just how long your peripherals <em>should </em>last, assuming you're not a competitive eSports athlete or a gaming peripherals editor.</p><h2 id="headsets-2">Headsets</h2><p>Matt's Razer Barracuda lasted about 2.5 years, which is definitely shorter than you should expect a gaming headset to last (and you shouldn't expect any gaming headset to snap at the hinge while you're just... wearing it). But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/best-gaming-headsets"><u>best gaming headsets</u></a> won't necessarily last forever, depending on a few factors.</p><p>Wireless headsets tend to lose their steam faster because the battery degrades — but you should still be able to get a solid 3 - 4 years out of a wireless headset, if not longer. Wired headsets can last significantly longer if they're well-built, but most gaming headsets are... not that well-built. Still, a decent wired headset should get you a solid 5 - 6 years of use — longer if it has replaceable parts.</p><p>Here's what you should look for if you're looking for a headset that won't snap in half:</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The only gripe? The earpads, which are leatherette-covered memory foam, wear out fairly quickly and are difficult to replace — mostly because Corsair didn't sell them for a long time (though I believe they do, now). Earpads tend to wear out after 1 - 2 years of regular use (or sooner, depending on what they're made of and whether you sweat), so you should look for a gaming headset with replaceable earpads.

Your mouse gets a lot more wear than your keyboard does, because it has significantly fewer buttons and it's always moving. (Also, if you are the type of gamer who gets heated, your mouse is probably the easiest thing to slam down on your desk or throw across the room.) Mouse switches and keyboard switches have similar click ratings, but you'll reach that number a lot quicker when you only have two buttons to choose from instead of 88 or 104 (or however many keys there are on your keyboard). That said, while updating your mouse every 2 - 3 years isn't crazy, you should still be able to stretch a gaming mouse's lifespan to 3 - 4 years as long as you're not excessively slamming or squeezing it.</p><p>But you still want your gaming mouse to last the full 2 - 3 years, so here's what to look for:</p><p><strong>Solid build: </strong>This might seem like a no-brainer, but it's still worth mentioning — if you want your mouse to last, it needs to be well-built and sturdy-feeling right out of the box.

<![CDATA[ GPU sales skyrocketed 27% last quarter — tariff jitters sparked an odd gaming hardware spending surge in Q2 '25 ]]>
<p>The middle of the year is usually a sleepy season for PC hardware sales, and so summer quarter shipments tend to sag a bit as people hold off until holiday deals. Of course, 2025 has been anything but typical. Instead of the usual slowdown, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q225-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-increased-27-0-from-last-quarter/">the latest numbers</a> from Jon Peddie Research (JPR) show a surprising surge in CPU and GPU shipments. The culprit? Fear of tariffs, according to the analyst.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/usd320-camera-lens-buyers-hit-with-usd2-000-delivery-fee-in-tariffs-fight-some-sellers-implement-exorbitant-shipping-costs-to-dissuade-us-customers">new U.S. import tariffs</a> hanging over tech imports, PC makers and consumers alike went into buy-ahead mode. The result was a markedly unseasonal rush on gaming hardware that pulled demand forward, creating what could be called a "panic‑build quarter" in the client PC industry.</p><p>The numbers tell the story, as CPU shipments were up about 8% quarter‑over‑quarter and 13% year‑over‑year. Desktop CPUs increased their share versus laptops by 9% to grab 33% of the market share, a healthy bump in a segment that's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/best-gaming-laptops">overshadowed by laptops</a> in recent years.</p><p>Total GPU shipments jumped 8.4% from last quarter, up to 74.7 million units. Nvidia scooped up more share at the expense of AMD and Intel, likely due in part to the superior availability of its GPUs. However, Intel still sells more GPUs than either of the other two combined, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus">its dominance</a> in the laptop CPU market.</p><p>The standout statistic was discrete desktop graphics cards, or add-in boards (AIBs), up a wild 27% quarter‑to‑quarter and 22% year‑over‑year, due in part to impressive new hardware from all three vendors. Nvidia's grip tightened further, rising to 94% of the AIB market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-dominates-gpu-shipments-with-94-percent-share-shipment-surge-likely-caused-by-customers-getting-ahead-of-tariffs">as we previously reported</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Usually, shipments drift lower before rebounding at year's end, but this time, tariffs flipped the script. Retailers and distributors didn't want to get caught flat-footed if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-announces-100-percent-semiconductor-tariffs-theres-no-charge-for-chips-built-in-the-u-s">regulations suddenly raised costs</a>, and enthusiasts picked up on the same cues. Nobody wanted to be the one paying 15–25% more for a graphics card a few months later, so they bought early, clearing stock and pushing prices higher at the high end.</p><p>JPR calls this "buying ahead of tariffs," and it comes with a warning: demand that gets pulled forward can leave a hole later. Q3 and Q4 might look weaker because so many buyers have already opened their wallets.</p><p>This wasn't just about economics, though; it was also about timing. Nvidia's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5060-is-up-to-25-percent-faster-than-rtx-4060-with-frame-generation-in-new-gpu-preview">entry- and mid-range</a> Blackwell cards, as well as AMD's new RDNA 4 GPUs, were filling shelves right as the tariff panic set in. Gamers who might have otherwise waited for the latest hardware to mature instead rushed to lock down fresh GPUs while they could.</p><p>Interestingly, Dr. Peddie notes that the midrange stayed relatively affordable as vendors leaned on it to keep shipments moving. Still, flagship GPUs saw rising prices and severe shortages, reflecting what we've seen with the GeForce RTX 5090, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confirms-its-recently-delisted-rtx-50-series-founders-edition-cards-are-not-discontinued-limited-edition-products-were-removed-because-they-were-out-of-stock">which is unobtanium</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/usd3-700-rtx-5090-gpus-have-found-new-homes-after-sitting-on-us-retailers-shelves">at least, at MSRP</a>). The psychology is easy to trace: better to grab a new graphics card today than risk paying even more tomorrow.</p><p>Trump's tariffs didn't just bend economic charts; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/newegg-blames-tariffs-for-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-price-hikes">bent gamer behavior</a>.

<![CDATA[ Building in the Thermaltake Tower 250 made me furious about one design flaw that could be easily solved — cramped cable cut-outs and inaccessible I/O ]]>
<p>As I am sure many readers can relate, I heard the hallowed, somewhat daunting words that friends and loved ones say to the resident PC geek or tech enthusiast in their lives —
"Can you make me a PC?"</p><p>Of course, I've done it dozens of times, but this was the first time that my wife, who regularly plays (or attempts to run) AAA games on a basic RTX 3050 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/best-gaming-laptops">gaming laptop</a>, wanted something higher-end. I would figure out the components, and she could pick out a case, specifying other aesthetic frills she would like. It couldn't be a big, black, boring box, and it had to be an interesting color. My wife eventually settled on the Thermaltake Tower 250 in the eye-catching "Hydrangea Blue" colorway. The PC case is an evolution of the original Tower 100, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermaltake-the-tower-100-review/2">we reviewed in 2019</a>.</p><p>Things began to come together, and being a resourceful sort, we managed to corral all of the components to build a (slightly larger than usual) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases">ITX-based</a> system.</p><p>This isn't a super-high-end build, sporting an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-cpu-review">AMD Ryzen 5 9600X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review">RTX 4080 Founders Edition GPU</a>, which I had intended to use in a different build. With that, alongside a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD from Sabrent and 32GB of Klevv RAM, it is quite a performant system, which should easily run just about every modern AAA title without issue at 1440p.</p><p>Once the case arrived and we started the build process, I noticed something unusual. The Thermaltake Tower 250 rotates the motherboard 90 degrees, compared to a standard configuration. This allows for a vertically-placed GPU, a motherboard placed in the center, and then support for an all-in-one cooler's radiator on the right. This isn't an issue in itself, but it does cause the motherboard's I/O to be pointing to the top of the case, in addition to any GPU display cables.</p><h2 id="where-for-art-thou-i-o-2">Where for art thou, I/O</h2><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6ck3dBnEzh7vzMmLtcCRU" name="Thermaltake Tower 250 IO" alt="Tower 250 IO" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6ck3dBnEzh7vzMmLtcCRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The top of the Thermaltake Tower 250 is quite crowded; there are two preinstalled exhaust fans, in addition to the front I/O panel of the case. There's also a cut-out for cables, in addition to around an inch of clearance next to the fan shroud for anything coming from the motherboard IO, which feeds into a hole for the plastic shroud that covers it, leading out of the case.</p><p>So, if you want to plug anything into your motherboard, you'll have to navigate a frustrating labyrinth of cut-outs every single time. Many people will set and forget their rear I/O, ports, and with two USB-A and a Type-C port at the front, many just won't need it. Since this PC uses Wi-Fi, routing the antenna through was very simple, and I added a handful of USB-C cables to be routed to the desk to have a couple of chargers, in case she needs to plug things in.</p><p>What I didn't anticipate was the sheer number of random cables my wife would want to plug into her system at any given time. With the front I/O already populated, plugging in USB devices became more difficult than it really should be. When factoring in the heft of a DisplayPort cable in addition to everything else, things got pretty crowded.</p><p>So, the process of taking the top of the case off and wrangling around inside to plug in devices continued. This slight inconvenience turned into annoyance, and I answered the repeated calls of "Can you plug this in please?" repeatedly for a whole week, until I buckled and bought a generic USB hub from Amazon.</p><p>You shouldn't really have to do that for the sake of convenience, especially when a motherboard has enough IO for everything. But now that the saga is over, it also highlights another design issue for the Thermaltake Tower 250.</p><h2 id="building-cleanly-still-results-in-visible-cable-mess-2">Building cleanly still results in visible cable mess</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

The case has consistent and simple channels for almost everything, including support for a full-sized PSU. Cable channelling for the GPU is well-thought-out, meaning we hid the majority of a white 12V2x6 cable into a corner, which cannot be seen from most angles. With everything put together, it looked and ran well, until I realized that the I/O pointing out at the top can become a bit of an eyesore.</p><p>With several cables running out at the top, the effort put in elsewhere to hide cables so efficiently was seemingly for naught. Above the I/O, there's an inch or two of clearance where cables can be routed. The problem is that with the Hydrangea Blue colorway of the case, the internal metal sheets are white, so if you have any black cables, they stick out like a sore thumb. This is admittedly minor compared to my other grievance, but it also has a fairly simple solution.</p><p>If Thermaltake built a detachable shroud for this part of the Tower 250, which puts some effort into hiding the cabling, it would also allow for a larger cable routing channel through the rear, making it simpler to actually make use of the motherboard I/O, or offer a wider cut-out, which makes accessing the rear IO much more accessible. Adding more steps between allowing a user to make use of the features of the components within the system is a black mark on an otherwise well-designed and good-looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-pc-cases,4183.html">PC case</a>.</p>

After building in the Thermaltake Tower 250, I found that the ITX PC case has one issue that drove me mad: the Motherboard I/O is difficult to access.

<![CDATA[ Asus gives us the PCIe finger — teases new concept that boosts motherboard GPU slot power to 250W ]]>
<p>Since PCIe's inception in the early 2000s, the high-speed connectivity standard has been limited to 75 watts of peak power from the physical slot. This is enough to power some entry-level graphics cards from the physical slot alone, but most graphics cards require auxiliary power to get enough juice. However, Asus wants to change that — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/884/319.htm">IT Home</a> reports that the GPU maker has teased a new concept design allowing the PCIe slot to deliver a whopping 250 watts of power output through modifications to the PCIe front finger.</p><p>The concept reportedly takes advantage of the unused part of the front PCIe finger to triple power output. The five 12V lines attached to the PCIe finger are "merged", with each line featuring enhanced width and thickness as well as more conductive materials to boost the slot's current-carrying capacity.</p><p>Top-down images of Asus' modifications show the changes; the five 12V pins at the front are significantly larger, to the point where they are visible to the naked eye. This is in contrast to a regular PCIe slot, where the pins are so small that they are virtually impossible to spot. To feed the modified PCIe slot, most of the additional power is allegedly fed by an extra 8-pin PCIe connector on the motherboard.</p><p>Asus's PCIe concept could finally make cableless graphics cards more mainstream, assuming adoption is high. PCIe's 75-watt limit has left all but the most power-efficient entry-level graphics cards as the only mainstream GPUs that can do away with auxiliary power cables.</p><p>Technically, Asus already has an internal proprietary GPU power connector for its cableless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/asus-reveals-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5070-ti-gpus-with-a-detachable-1000w-power-connector">BTF</a> products (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/asus-gpu-power-connector-delivers-1-000w-for-cableless-builds-gc-hpwr-has-a-retractable-design">GC-HPWR</a>). But Asus is likely building its aforementioned PCIe modification as a cheaper method to create cableless GPUs, particularly for the mainstream market. Modifying the PCIe slot on a motherboard or graphics card is cheaper than installing an extra internal finger for internal power delivery.</p><p>250 watts is not a lot of power in an era where most high-performance GPUs consume more than 350 watts. But 250 watts would be more than sufficient for all entry-level and lower-mid-range graphics cards. For example, AMD's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review">Radeon RX 9060 XT</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review"> RX 9070</a> consume just 160 and 220 watts, respectively, making them prime candidates for Asus' PCIe modification.</p><p>Again, though, Asus' concept is just that, a concept. There's no knowing how widely adopted Asus' design will be if it ever gets finalized. Asus' concept is also a modification of the PCIe standard, which could make adoption even harder. Even if it is adopted, board makers and AIB makers would need to build new graphics cards and motherboard models specifically designed to take advantage of Asus' concept, which would increase costs and manufacturing complexity.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia CEO Huang says upcoming DGX Spark systems are powered by N1 silicon — confirms GB10 Superchip and N1/N1X SoCs are identical ]]>
<p>Yesterday, Nvidia and Intel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">lifted the curtain on a historic collaboration</a> that will see the two chipmakers jointly develop a myriad of CPU and GPU products. While future solutions like the "Intel x86 RTX SoC" were the focus of the announcement, some clarification was also shed on existing projects. Chief among these was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying that the upcoming, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-arm-soc-for-windows-machines-reportedly-debuting-in-q4-featuring-n1x-with-n1-to-follow-in-early-2026">long-rumored N1 SoC</a> is essentially the same as the GB10 Superchip that's been out for a while.</p><p>For some context, Nvidia has never officially unveiled the N1/N1X SoCs, but speculation sparked from CES 2025's announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-project-digits-desktop-ai-supercomputer-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand-usd3-000-to-bring-1-pflops-of-performance-home?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Project DIGITS</a>, where the company revealed its collaboration with MediaTek. From that came the GB10 "Superchip," which is part of the company's DGX Spark lineup, and multiple vendors have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/acer-unveils-project-digits-supercomputer-featuring-nvidias-gb10-superchip-with-128gb-of-lpddr5x">already released their iterations of it</a>. The GB10 is aimed squarely at AI workloads, offering supercomputer-like performance at home. It includes a 20-core ARM-based CPU developed in conjunction with MediaTek, along with a powerful Blackwell-based GPU chiplet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Back in July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-n1x-soc-leaks-with-the-same-number-of-cuda-cores-as-an-rtx-5070-n1x-specs-align-with-the-gb10-superchip">we saw a Geekbench score</a> surface for the N1X, which allegedly confirmed these specs, giving credence to the fact that GB10 and N1 are intrinsically tied. Of course, just because two products are closely linked to each other doesn't mean they're the same, but all signs pointed toward identical chips being used across the board.</p><p>That notion has just been legitimized by Jensen Huang, who said the following in a webcast last night, "We also have a new ARM product that's called N1. And that product is - that processor is going to go into the DGX Spark and many other versions of products like that. And so we're super excited about the ARM road map, and this doesn't affect any of that."</p><p>According to Nvidia's CEO, the silicon powering the GB10 — which itself is what powers DGX Spark — is identical to the N1/N1X SoC. Especially the part about "many other versions" confirms that N1 could simply be a slightly lower-binned version of the full-fat GB10. After all, the latter is meant for client devices like laptops and desktops, whereas the GB10 targets professionals. The distinction matters because N1 represents Nvidia's first serious attempt at taking their in-house CPU cores mainstream (following Tegra).</p><figure class="van-image-figure

But at least it's out there now that GB10, which should already be in the hands of some, is what Nvidia will eventually release in the future, just with a different target audience in mind. Given Nvidia's new deal with Intel, the interest in developing ARM-based products might collide with x86-based solutions that Intel specializes in. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/teams-at-nvidia-and-intel-have-been-working-in-secret-on-jointly-developed-processors-for-a-year-the-trump-administration-has-no-involvement-in-this-partnership-at-all">However, that's apparently not an issue,</a> and both roadmaps will continue forward at full force, unaffected by each other.</p><p>The N1 SoC has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidias-upcoming-arm-based-n1x-soc-leaks-again-this-time-on-furmark-modest-benchmark-score-indicates-early-engineering-sample-but-confirms-windows-evaluation">already been tested on Windows</a>, which suggests that the chip is getting closer to its Windows-on-ARM destination day by day. The GB10, on the other hand, is not exactly intended for Microsoft's operating system; rather, it is a Linux-based DGX OS that's optimized for local AI, datacenter, and other professional workloads. With that said, since the N1 technically doesn't even exist yet, there is no confirmation for it eventually running on Windows (despite the obvious implication), and Jensen Huang did not comment on it either.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Perhaps these Blackwell GPUs will look more convincing when retailers start offering genuine discounts rather than merely reverting elevated prices to MSRP.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ AMD silently launches RX 7700 non-XT with 16 GB VRAM — New RDNA 3 GPU uses nerfed Navi 32 die, offers reduced performance and increased power draw ]]>
<p>If you thought RDNA 3 was done, think again, because AMD has just refreshed the lineup with a brand new SKU — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7700-xt.html" target="_blank">the RX 7700 non-XT</a>. Listed silently on its website without any announcement, the RX 7700 comes with 16 GB of GDDR6 memory saturated across a 256-bit bus, compared to the 7700 XT's relatively meager 12 GB (across 192-bit). AMD has used 19.5 Gbps chips, so, combined with the aforementioned specs, that puts the memory bandwidth on par with the 7800 XT, at 624 GB/s.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.68%;"><img id="EsC5duAZgj3s9peMoDQiNm" name="Screenshot 2025-09-19 at 7.48.01 PM" alt="AMD Radeon RX 7700 specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsC5duAZgj3s9peMoDQiNm.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3216" height="2080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GPU under the hood is a cut-down version of Navi 32 with just 2,560 Stream Processors and 40 Compute Units. The 7700 XT uses the same Navi 32 but has 3,456 Stream Processors and 54 CUs; it also has more ROPs and TMUs (see table at the end), and 48 MB Infinity Cache compared to just 40 MB on the RX 7700. Moreover, there are 80 AI accelerators on the RX 7700, which isn't impressive on its own, but when you combine that with the 16 GB memory pool, this could become a sleeper option for local AI applications.</p><p>In terms of performance, AMD lists FPS numbers for a bunch of different games, showing a ~20% decrease in gaming compared to the 7700 XT (when taking into account games that overlap). Not only that, but the RX 7700 seems to be less efficient too, eating up 263W of power (versus 245W on the 7700 XT) despite the reduced performance. That leaves local AI inference the only real selling point for this SKU, if it's priced right to begin with. There are dual 8-pin connectors on board, and AMD recommends a 700W power supply for the RX 7700.</p><div ><table><caption>RDNA 3 70-class gaming performance</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Game</p></th><th

Therefore, launching the RX 7700 non-XT at anything more than ~$350 would seriously cannibalise the lineup, rendering it DoA.</p><div ><table><caption>RDNA 3 70-class specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>GPU Specs</p></th><th

AMD has just launched the RX 7700 non-XT with 16 GB memory and binned down specs compared to the RX 7700 XT. It's considerably slower in gaming, takes more power than the RX 7700 XT, but has increased VRAM that could make it a hit for AI. Pricing and availability are up in the air.

<![CDATA[ [Updated] Intel says it remains committed to its Arc graphics project — 'Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings' ]]>
<p><strong>09/19/2025 update</strong>: <em>After publication, an Intel representative reached out with the following statement regarding GPU development: "While we’re not sharing specific roadmaps at this time, everything we discussed aligns with and complements Intel’s existing strategy. This collaboration with NVIDIA enables us to deliver additional custom solutions that accelerate AI workloads and broaden our reach across high-performance computing segments in client and data center.</em></p><p><em>We remain committed to our GPU roadmap. We’ll be collaborating with NVIDIA to serve specific market segments, but we’re also continuing to execute on our own path."</em></p><p><em>The original article follows below.</em></p><p>All talk in town right now is all about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">Intel-Nvidia partnership</a>, and a question on many minds is whether that means Intel might be scrapping its plans for upcoming Arc graphics cards or iGPUs. The company is attempting to assuage those fears, as one of its spokespeople told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2913872/intel-nvidia-deal-doesnt-change-its-roadmap.html" target="_blank">PCWorld</a>, “We’re not discussing specific roadmaps at this time, but the collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings."</p><p>Intel also reiterated that its collaboration with Nvidia is "complementary" to the company's extant roadmap. Both those statements seem clear at face value, but some might find it a little hard to believe, given everything that's happened with Intel in the past year, namely but not only the major cuts to its workforce and a refocusing on profitability. The wording of the statement is also curious, as the company stating it will still have GPUs doesn't clarify what type they will be, or who will design them.</p><p>Last December, Intel's ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger left abruptly. Shortly after, former CEO of Products Michelle Holthaus stated that Intel remained committed to Arc. In March, Intel named Lip-Bu Tan as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-appoints-lip-bu-tan-as-permanent-ceo">new CEO</a>, who issued more staff cuts and reportedly issued an order that any of Intel's new products have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-draws-a-line-in-the-sand-to-boost-gross-margins-new-products-must-deliver-50-percent-to-get-the-green-light">50% gross margin</a>. Additionally, Holthaus was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-ousts-ceo-of-products-as-part-of-the-latest-executive-shake-up-ending-30-year-career-company-also-establishes-new-custom-chip-design-unit">ousted recently</a>, after a mere 10 months in charge of Products. The company offered no updates to its Arc roadmap in the meantime.</p><p>All those events would be enough to question Arc's continued existence, but now the Nvidia partnership has added further concern, especially in light of Intel saying that it intends to use RTX chiplets in mobile and gaming devices, casting a pall over Arc iGPUs. Judging by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" target="_blank">Steam hardware survey</a>, Intel's share has remained fairly steady over the past couple of years, sitting at 7.9%. If RTX chiplets in mobile devices prove popular, they would certainly eat away at it.</p><p>Intel and Nvidia both claim their partnership won't affect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/desktop-gpu-roadmap-nvidia-rubin-amd-udna-and-intel-xe3-celestial" target="_blank"><u>existing roadmaps</u></a>, but some in the enthusiast community fear<strong> </strong>that a $5 billion cash influx from Nvidia could come with pressure for Intel not to compete with RTX cards — assuming Nvidia is still fully focused on the gaming market, given how it now represents a small fraction of the company's business.</p><p>We reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-arc-b580-review-the-new-usd249-gpu-champion-has-arrived/">Arc B580</a> in December and found it to have the best value in its price bracket despite some misgivings about its drivers. The $250 price point is hotly contested, and a high volume of sales in this bracket would certainly translate into additional market share for Intel, which has seen the size of its slice remain steady over the past couple of years. The existing Arc roadmap looks promising, but despite Intel's statement, many feel its future is under threat.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Researchers 3D print lightweight ceramic fuel cell — suggests alternative power source for the aerospace industry ]]>
<p>The world of fuel cells just got a jolt thanks to researchers from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The team has been hard at work developing a new technology that could completely change the way we approach fuel cell manufacturing. The new process involves 3D printing and results in what the team refers to as the "Monolithic Gyroidal Solid Oxide Cell" (or just "The Monolith" for short). This work was reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/monolithic-gyroidal-solid-oxide-cells-by-additive-manufacturing" target="_blank">Interesting Engineering,</a> along with a journal published on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/monolithic-gyroidal-solid-oxide-cells-by-additive-manufacturing" target="_blank">DTU</a> website.</p><p>The team implemented a custom design inspired by the natural construction of coral. This shape optimizes surface area while the material composition allows for a much lighter-weight end product. Most fuel cells are comprised of metal, which contributes greatly to their weight. This fuel cell is apparently completely ceramic.</p><p>The intricate design is known as a gyroid and is a type of triply periodic minimal surface (shortened to TPMS). These surfaces are intended to provide as much surface area as possible. It's beneficial, particularly in this case, as the surface provides more optimal heat dispersion. According to the development team, the cell is capable of producing more than a watt of power for each gram of its own weight.</p><p>The material also has a surprisingly noteworthy amount of durability. When testing the fuel cell's ability to withstand temperature fluctuations, it managed to handle temperatures as high as 212° F (100° C). It also maintained its structural integrity when alternating between both power-storing and generating modes.</p><p>The fuel cell also features something called "Electrolysis Mode" which increases the hydrogen production rate almost tenfold compared to standard fuel cells. The 3D printing aspect of the design also helps make the manufacturing process easier than regular fuel cells.</p><p>If you want to get into the world of 3D printing but aren't sure where to start, check out our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-3d-printers">best 3D printers</a> to see what we recommend and why.

However, Linux is open to everyone. Ubuntu is proof of that. From my perspective, Ubuntu offers the ease of use that macOS provides, but without the walled garden that Apple promotes. Ubuntu is free, and it works on older hardware. The installation process has been streamlined, particularly over the last couple of years, with a redesign and tweaks to reduce friction for new users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

They both had a great installer for the time. Remember, this was a time when the installer would scrutinize your system and ask you to make every decision along the way (including writing a custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://x.org" target="_blank"><u>X.org</u></a> file), which would scare some from trying. I mention Corel Linux (a Debian-based distro) because that was the first Linux distro that worked for me. The installer felt, dare I say it? More Windows than Linux, and for someone moving over, it was easier to use.</p><p>Corl Linux was great fun, and the CDE (a variant of KDE) user interface was similar to Windows of that era, so not too much for me to learn. Corel Linux just gave me a basic install, not too many apps to choose from, but enough. Unlike the time that I downloaded Mandrake Linux (two days to download two CDs!) and chose to install everything. The app menus were rammed full of stuff that I had no idea about.</p><p>I loved Mandrake Linux. It felt great and worked well on the hardware of the era.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia wants 10Gbps HBM4 to blunt AMD’s MI450, report claims — company said to be pushing suppliers for more bandwidth ]]>
<p>Nvidia is pressing its memory vendors to push beyond JEDEC’s official HBM4 baseline. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250918-12719.html" target="_blank"><em>TrendForce</em></a>, the company has requested 10Gb/s-per-pin stacks for its 2026 Vera Rubin platform, a move designed to raise per-GPU bandwidth ahead of AMD’s next-generation MI450 Helios systems.</p><p>At 8Gb/s per pin — the rate JEDEC specifies for HBM4 — a single stack delivers just under 2 TB/s across the new 2,048-bit interface. Raising that to 10Gb/s bumps the total to 2.56 TB/s per stack. With six stacks, a single GPU clears 15 TB/s of raw bandwidth. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rubin-cpx-die-shot-reveals-graphics-specific-hardware-blocks-not-needed-for-an-ai-gpu-rubin-cpx-may-form-the-foundation-of-next-gen-rtx-6090">Rubin CPX</a>, Nvidia's compute-optimized config built to handle the most demanding inference workloads, is advertised with 1.7 petabytes per second across a full NVL144 rack. The higher the pin speed, the less margin Nvidia needs elsewhere to hit those numbers.</p><p>But driving 10Gb/s HBM4 isn’t a given. Faster I/O brings higher power, tighter timing, and more strain on the base die. TrendForce notes that Nvidia may segment Rubin SKUs by HBM tier if costs or thermals spike.

<![CDATA[ $115 million ransomware hacker arrested over extortion attacks — Scattered Spider alumnus allegedly involved in over 120 computer network intrusions targeting 47 U.S. entities ]]>
<p>A teenage hacker from the UK has been arrested on charges of money laundering conspiracy, computer fraud, and wire fraud conspiracy, and stands accused of being part of a hacking group that extorted over $115 million from close to 50 victims in America, alongside various attacks in the UK, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-kingdom-national-charged-connection-multiple-cyber-attacks-including-critical" target="_blank">Department of Justice</a>. Alleged to be part of the infamous "Scattered Spider" hacking group, it seems that 19-year-old Thalha Jubair wasn't one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/hacker-ransomware-groups-announce-retirement-to-enjoy-their-golden-parachutes-no-further-attacks-planned-future-attributed-activities-will-relate-to-undisclosed-past-breaches">lucky few who were able to ride off into the sunset</a> after its retirement announcement earlier this month.</p><p>Jubair is alleged to have been involved in at least 120 different computer network intrusions over a three-year period, starting in 2022. The complaint, filed with the District of New Jersey, accuses Jubair of targeting 47 U.S. entities. He and the group he was a part of, Scattered Spider, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/jaguar-land-rover-shuts-down-production-due-to-ransomware-attack-scattered-lapsus-usd-hunters-takes-responsibility">were well known for utilizing social engineering techniques to gain access to corporate networks</a> and then steal data or use ransomware attacks to blackmail and extort the businesses for profit.</p><p>Over just the past few years, Jubair is alleged to have extorted over $115 million from victims all over the world. Although the FBI Newark field office is investigating the case, it's doing so in conjunction with the UK National Crime Agency and City of London Police, as well as police agencies in the Netherlands, Romania, Canada, and Australia.</p><p>He also seems to have had particular involvement in controlling the money extracted from victims. Portions of the ransom payments were sent to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by Jubair. In July 2024, when law enforcement seized the server said to be storing the wallets containing cryptocurrency worth some $36 million, Jubair is alleged to have transferred some of those tokens, with a reported net worth of $8.4 million, to another wallet.</p><p>“The arrest of Thalha Jubair underscores an undeniable truth: no matter how elusive or destructive these cyber-criminal syndicates are, we will continue to pursue those who allegedly extort our businesses and ensure they are held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Stefanie Roddy for the FBI.</p><p>Jubair was arrested in London and was formally charged on September 18. Alongside the charges in U.S. courts, he also stands accused of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="" target="_blank">attack against Transport for London (TFL) infrastructure</a> in August 2024, where customer data, including names, contact details, and addresses, were compromised.</p><p>London police also arrested a fellow accused hacker, 18-year-old Owen Flowers, who also stands accused of involvement with the TFL hack. Flowers faces additional charges in the U.S., too, where he's accused of attacking health companies SSM Health Care Corporation and Sutter Health.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ I have the most luxurious standing desk imaginable, but I can't quite bring myself to game while standing ]]>
<p>For more than two-and-a-half years, I've been blessed to call the inimitable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-pro">Secretlab Magnus Pro</a> my main workspace. A colossal sit-stand desk, the hulking slab of metal comes with a nifty integrated sit-stand controller, two gargantuan legs, extensive cable management, and an eye-wateringly expensive magnetic ecosystem — the entire surface is magnetic, and can be used with a range of metal cable management devices, headphone stands, and cable sleeves. It is truly the Rolls-Royce of office furniture, vast and expensive, the purview of only the most hardcore work surface connoisseurs.</p><p>Yet on reflection of my time behind Secretlab's (probably) bombproof behemoth, I've come to the awful realization that I might have played myself. Somewhere along the way these last two years, I simply stopped standing up to use this desk, a full 50% of this desk's potential left on the table, if you'll pardon the pun. More specifically, I've realized that I own one of the world's most luxurious standing desks for gaming, yet I never stand up to game.</p><p>The benefits of using a standing desk are well-documented and numerous. Did you know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24297826/" target="_blank">standing up at your desk</a> after lunch can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 43%?<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10973891/" target="_blank"> Reducing your time spent</a> sitting can lower blood pressure in older adults, reduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/00140139.2024.2414197?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank">pain and fatigue</a>, and, of course, help your posture. There's even some evidence to suggest that moving between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14634" target="_blank">sitting and standing makes you more productive at work</a>.</p><p>But it's not productivity I'm after. While I've historically been happy to stand up at my desk for work, it's for play where I've generally neglected standing up altogether, leading to my realisation that I've stopped standing up completely while at my desk and probably need to take a long, hard look at myself. But it got me thinking: Is there any market at all for a desk that lets you stand whilst gaming? The Magnus Pro is dynamite for productivity, but would I <em>ever</em> want to stand up to game behind it?</p><h2 id="a-place-called-vertigo-2">A place called vertigo</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

Notably, gaming is generally a relaxing thing you do to unwind. The bash marks on my Xbox controller and that Samsung monitor I smashed in 2017 might disagree with me, but for inexplicable reasons, I feel like anyone standing up to game would generally be untrustworthy. <br><br>I associate standing up to game with those old Xbox 360 arcade machines you'd find at GameStop (or your local equivalent), or with going to the Casino. If you dialled into an Xbox Live party or your usual Discord haunt and found out that one of your friends was standing up to play during that particular session, you'd probably ask them if everything was okay, or perhaps if there was something wrong with their chair.</p><p>Either gaming is relaxing (like a nice leisurely <em>Rome Total War </em>conquest), or it is quite intense (the throngs of the new <em>Battlefield 6</em>). For me, both call for the planted assurance of being sat in a sturdy chair (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review-superior-gaming-chair">Secretlab's Titan Evo</a> if you were wondering).

Perhaps then, the beauty of a sit-stand desk dedicated to gamers is to be found in the work half of your work-life balance. Stand up during the day and get the posture and circulatory benefits while you're at work, then put your feet up at the end of the day.
I might try my hand at a little upright recreation going forward, but I can't help thinking that I'll last maybe five minutes before I decide I'd much rather sit down. <br><br>Have you gamed while standing up since the heyday of arcades?

<![CDATA[ Nvidia drops a cool $900 million on Enfabrica tech and hiring its CEO, report claims — AI networking chip company boasts capacity to connect 100,000 GPUs together ]]>
<p>Nvidia has reportedly paid out more than $900 million to hire the CEO of AI networking hardware company, Enfabrica. Rochan Sankar and a number of his colleagues at Enfabrica will become Nvidia staff members as part of the deal, and Nvidia will get the option to license the company's hardware, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-spent-over-900-million-on-enfabrica-ceo-ai-startup-technology.html" target="_blank">according to CNBC. </a></p><p>The deal will reportedly involve cash and stock options, and comes just two years after Nvidia invested part of a $125 million fund into Enfabrica. However, while the company was valued in the high hundreds of millions, paying close to a billion dollars for a handful of staff and a license would potentially value the company much higher. Clearly, Enfabrica has talent and technology that Nvidia feels is crucial to its ongoing development. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the report.</p><p>Indeed, it's not hard to see why. Nvidia's meteoric rise in value and prominence in recent years has been on the back of its AI hardware developments. Today, its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-gb200-production-ramps-up-after-suppliers-tackle-ai-server-overheating-and-liquid-cooling-leaks"> GPUs power many of the world's data centers </a>(and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-is-building-100-ai-factories-jensens-50-year-gambit-begins">"AI factories"</a>) with 72 within each of the latest Blackwell GPU stacks. In some of these data centers, though, 10s or even hundreds of thousands of GPUs can be working in conjunction to power the latest AI technologies, and it's the connections between those chips that Enfabrica may be able to help improve.</p><p>Nvidia has touted its NVLink technology for allowing high-speed communication between its GPUs, allowing them to work on the same task in parallel without bottlenecking one another or causing synchronization issues. Enfabrica's tech may go beyond that, though, with the company claiming it can help connect more than 100,000 GPUs. That's the kind of scalability that Nvidia is looking for as it continues its global expansion.</p><p>This major (and expensive) hire for Nvidia mirrors those announced by other tech firms in recent months. Meta famously spent tens of billions hiring the CEO of ScaleAI and other AI experts from various companies, and many of the top tech firms like OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic, and Google have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-says-meta-is-offering-obscene-usd100m-bonuses-to-poach-ai-employees-and-even-bigger-salaries-openai-ceo-says-none-of-our-best-people-decided-to-take-them-up-on-that">trying to poach each other's top talent</a> for many months now.

<![CDATA[ Here's how I installed Windows 11 using a nano-sized 2.4GB ISO — final install weighed in at a mere 8.36GB, two-thirds the size of a normal Windows install, courtesy of Nano11 Builder ]]>
<p>I’ve yet to make the leap to Windows 11; I’ve got an IT request form to file, and I’ll probably need a weekend to migrate all of my files. I’m probably best known for being a Linux and Raspberry Pi advocate, so why should I want to move to Windows 11? Well, firstly, I have to for my work. However, I also edit videos using DaVinci Resolve, and yes, you can install it on Linux, but I’ve yet to be successful.</p><p>Recently, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/nano11-compresses-windows-11-install-footprint-to-as-little-as-2-8gb-extreme-experimental-script-is-3-5-times-smaller-than-tiny11-and-comes-with-none-of-the-fluff"><u>covered a story</u></a> on NTDEV’s latest project to shrink the Windows 11 installation ISO image. The project, Nano11 Builder, aims to create the smallest ISO possible, but it is “an extreme experimental script designed for creating a quick and dirty development testbed,” according to the pseudonymous developer.</p><p>Why would you use such a tool to make smaller ISOs? Because you can, and they could be useful for developing your own appliances based on Windows. Should you use it for mission-critical applications? Absolutely not, but am I going to give it a go and see how small an installation I can create? Of course!</p><h2 id="creating-the-smallest-windows-11-isos-possible-2">Creating the smallest Windows 11 ISOs possible</h2><div ><table><caption>ISO Sizes</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

No, seriously, I waited a long time for the scripts to complete, around 90 minutes on my Lenovo X390 with an eighth-generation Intel Core i5.</p><p>The base ISO is direct from Microsoft, and it weighs in at 5,695,402KB (5.69GB), which isn’t huge by today's standards, but it is bulging with applications and tools that some users may not want or need. The Tiny version of the ISO is half the size of the base ISO, and the nano is nearly two-thirds the size of the base image. A smaller ISO means that plenty of apps and features have been removed, leaving us with a core Windows 11 installation.</p><p>With that in mind, how small is the final installation for each of the ISOs? There is only one way to find out, and it is going to take a little more time.</p><h2 id="installing-windows-11-three-times-for-science-2">Installing Windows 11 Three Times…for Science?</h2><div ><table><caption>ISO Sizes</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

For the full Windows 11 installation, I used a Lenovo X220, a machine that is clearly not intended to run Windows 11. I did need to use Rufus to write the ISO images to a USB flash drive, including a quick hack to bypass RAM, TPM, and Secure Boot requirements.</p><p>Why the difference? Because after successfully installing Windows 11 Nano and Tiny ISOs in the VM, the full Windows 11 ISO would not install in the VM, despite meeting the requirements. As the focus is on the installation size, the tests are valid.</p><p>Installing Nano started off simple. A few steps were skipped (no reg key and no choice of Windows 11 version), and the installation started. I got to 75% and then the installer crashed with an error, and the laptop rebooted. I tried again. Same issue. How did I bypass it? Well, it took raising a GitHub issue, receiving a suggestion to try the older setup process, and yes, it worked!</p><p>Installation was slow on my VM, and at times I had to reboot, but I got there in the end.

<![CDATA[ Huawei unveils Atlas 950 SuperCluster — promises 1 ZettaFLOPS FP4 performance and features hundreds of thousands of 950DT APUs ]]>
<p>Huawei has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2025/9/hc-xu-keynote-speech">unveiled</a> its next-generation data-center scale AI solution that can offer 1 FP4 ZettaFLOPS performance for AI inference and 524 FP8 ExaFLOPS for AI training at its Huawei Connect 2025 conference on Thursday. The new SuperCluster 950 system runs hundreds of thousands of the company's Ascend 950DT neural processing units (NPUs) and promises to be one of the most powerful supercomputers for artificial intelligence on the planet. Huawei expects its SuperCluster to compete with Nvidia's Rubin-based systems in late 2026.</p><h2 id="massive-performance-2">Massive performance</h2><p>Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster will consist of 64 Atlas 950 SuperPoDs, which are the company's rack-scale AI solutions akin to Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 or the next-generation Vera Rubin NVL144. The Atlas 950 SuperCluster will be built upon 524,288 Ascend 950DT AI accelerators distributed across over 10,240 optically interconnected cabinets.</p><p>The supercomputer purportedly offers up to 524 FP8 ExaFLOPS for AI training and up to 1 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for AI inference (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/RakshitAralimatti/learn-ai-with-me">MXFP4</a> to be more specific), which puts it just behind leading-edge AI supercomputers, such as Oracle's OCI Supercluster running 131,072 B200 GPUs and offering peak performance of up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-and-oracle-team-up-for-zettascale-cluster-available-with-up-to-131072-blackwell-gpus">2.4 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for inference introduced last year</a>. Keep in mind these figures pertain to peak performance numbers, so it remains to be seen whether they can be achieved in real life.</p><p>This SuperCluster is designed to support both RoCE (Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet) and Huawei's proprietary UBoE (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-to-open-source-its-ub-mesh-data-center-scale-interconnect-soon-details-technical-aspects-one-interconnect-to-rule-them-all-is-designed-to-replace-everything-from-pcie-to-tcp-ip">UnifiedBus</a> over Ethernet) protocols, though it remains to be seen how fast the latter will be adopted. According to Huawei, UBoE offers lower idle-state latency, higher hardware reliability, and requires fewer switches and optical modules than traditional RoCE setups.</p><p>Huawei positions its Atlas 950 SuperCluster to support training and inference workloads for AI models with hundreds of billions to tens of trillions of parameters. Huawei believes this platform is well-suited for the next wave of large-scale dense and sparse models, thanks to its combination of compute throughput, interconnect bandwidth, and system stability. Though given its size, it is unclear how many companies will be able to accommodate the system.</p><h2 id="massive-footprint-2">Massive footprint</h2><p>Huawei admits that it cannot build processors that would challenge Nvidia's GPUs in terms of performance. Therefore, to achieve 1 ZettaFLOPS with the Atlas 950 SuperCluster, it intends to use a brute force approach, utilizing hundreds of thousands of AI accelerators to compete against Nvidia Rubin-based clusters in 2026–2027.</p><p>A common building block of Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster is the Atlas 950 SuperPoD that integrates 8,192 Ascend 950DT chips, representing a 20-fold increase in processing units compared to the Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD (also known as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huaweis-new-ai-cloudmatrix-cluster-beats-nvidias-gb200-by-brute-force-uses-4x-the-power">CloudMatrix 384</a>) and a massive increase in compute performance — 8 FP8 ExaFLOPS and 16 FP4 ExaFLOPS.</p><p>Performance of the Atlas 950 SuperCluster is truly impressive on paper; it is said to be massively higher compared to Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL144 (1.2 FP8 ExaFLOPS, 3.6 NVFP4 ExaFLOPS), a product that the company compares it to. However, that performance comes at a price, namely size. The Atlas 950 SuperCluster setup includes 160 total cabinets — 128 for computation and 32 for communications — spread across 1,000 square meters, which is about the size of two basketball courts. By contrast, Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL144 is a rack-scale solution that consists of one compute rack and one cable and switch rack that requires just several square meters of space.</p><p>As for Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster — which consists of 64 Atlas 950 SuperPoDs and should measure around 64,000 m2 — its size is comparable to 150 basketball courts, or nine regulation soccer fields. Keep in mind, though, that a real campus would likely require additional space for power rooms, chillers/cooling towers, battery/UPS systems, and support offices, so the total site footprint could be significantly larger than 64,000 m².</p><h2 id="the-road-ahead-2">The road ahead</h2><p>One of the things about selling server hardware is that customers always want to know what is next, so in addition to having a good product, it is vital to have a roadmap. So at the Huawei Connect, the company disclosed plans to launch the Atlas 960 SuperCluster alongside the Atlas 960 SuperPoD in the fourth quarter of 2027.</p><p>This next-generation system will scale up to more than 1 million Ascend 960 NPUs and will provide 2 FP8 ZettaFLOPS and 4 MXFP4 ZettaFLOPS of performance. It will also support both UBoE and RoCE, with the former expected to deliver improved latency and uptime metrics while continuing to rely on Ethernet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Teams at Nvidia and Intel have been working in secret on jointly developed processors for a year — 'The Trump administration has no involvement in this partnership at all' ]]>
<p>Intel and Nvidia have been working on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">jointly developed processors for client and data center products</a> for about a year now as both companies see huge opportunities behind their Intel x86 RTX SoCs and custom Nvidia x86 data center processors. Although the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press call that the Trump administration was pleased with the collaboration between two leading U.S. companies, it had nothing to do with it.</p><h2 id="trump-not-involved-2">Trump not involved</h2><p>"The Trump administration had had no involvement in this partnership at all," said Nvidia's Huang said, during the joint press conference with Nvidia on Thursday. "They would have been very supportive, of course. Today I had the opportunity to tell Secretary [of Commerce Howard] Lutnick and he was very excited and very supportive of seeing two American technology companies working together."</p><p>The work began around a year ago, and preliminary agreements were reached by Intel's then-CEO Pat Gelsinger and Nvidia's Jensen Huang even before that. (A year ago, Joe Biden was president, though no one suggested his administration was involved, either.) Intel and Nvidia are working on custom data center CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI platforms as well as GPU tiles that Intel will integrate into its upcoming client processors. In both cases CPUs and GPUs will use Nvidia's NVLink technology as an I/O interface. By now, there are three teams working together on the joint projects.</p><h2 id="the-work-is-ongoing-2">The work is ongoing</h2><p> "The two technology teams have been discussing and architecting solutions now for probably coming out to a year," said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. "The two architecture teams… Well, it is three architecture teams are working across... the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for server and PCs. The architecture work is fairly extensive, and the teams are really excited about the new architecture. The teams have been working for a while and we are excited about the announcement today."</p><p>As Huang mentioned teams working on a CPU architecture as well as client and data center product lines, we figure out that Nvidia wants rather deep customizations of Intel's Xeons to meet the needs of its AI platforms.</p><p>The involvement of a CPU architecture team highlights the depth of the partnership between Intel and Nvidia as well as indicates that the CPU company is implementing rather deep optimizations required by next-generation AI platforms. Given Nvidia's history with Grace and Vera CPUs (custom Arm) and the high bandwidth needs of its next-gen GPUs (e.g. Rubin, Feynman, post-Feynman, etc.), it is reasonable to expect tailored cache structures, memory IO, and coherency protocols on these x86 CPUs.<br><br>Such a deep collaboration probably means that custom Intel processors will be used by Nvidia sometimes in the post-Vera Rubin platform era. We would certainly expect Nvidia's data center GPU team to work with Intel as well, but Huang never mentioned one during the call, probably because Feynman GPUs have already been defined by now.</p><p>Yet, he mentioned that there are two more teams working on product lines for server and PC products, which probably points to data center system level architecture team on Nvidia's side as well as client CPU/system level architecture team on Intel's side.</p><p>While the collaboration between Intel and Nvidia on the data center front is a multi-faceted cross-organizational effort, the timing to its fruition is tied to emergence of Intel's custom CPUs for Nvidia.</p><p>As for the joint work on client project (or projects), developing an Intel CPU with Nvidia GPU chiplet will take at least three to four years from drawing board to volume production. The collaboration requires deep integration across SoC fabrics, dimensions, performance/power consumption targets, packaging technologies (Foveros, EMIB), and software stacks from both companies. The collaboration likely began in 2024, so the first products could hit the market in late 2027 or early 2028.</p><h2 id="hundreds-of-millions-of-pcs-2">Hundreds of millions of PCs</h2><p>While we do not know for sure when Intel and Nvidia plan to come up with jointly developed products, it looks like they intend to address a broad range of applications. At least, Jensen Huang said that that the two companies plan to build CPUs that could address the vast majority of notebooks, which points to hundreds of millions of devices.</p><p>"Just the notebook market is 150 million notebooks sold each year," said Huang. "So that kind of gives you a sense of the scale of the work that we are going to do here. We are going to address the consumer market, we are going to address a vast majority of that consumer PC market, consumer PC notebook market."</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ xAI's new gas turbine facility gets halfway to Elon Musk's 1-gigawatt 'AI factory' goal ]]>
<p>xAI is moving faster than anyone expected on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-xai-power-plant-overseas-to-power-1-million-gpus"><u>power strategy</u></a>. According to a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semianalysis.com/2025/09/16/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter/" target="_blank"><u><em>SemiAnalysis</em></u></a>, Elon Musk’s AI startup already has 460MW of natural gas generation either installed or under construction, split between its Memphis campus and a new site across the border in Southaven, Mississippi.</p><p>The numbers check out against state filings and local reporting. Shelby County granted xAI a permit in July for 15 stationary gas turbines at its Paul R. Lowry Road facility in Memphis after months of wrangling with environmental groups, which alleged that dozens of turbines had been running without proper approval. In Mississippi, regulators issued a 12-month authorization to operate gas turbines at 2875 Stanton Road, a property xAI acquired from Duke Energy this summer, while the company builds out a permanent plant.</p><p>Equipment lists emerging from legal disclosures align with SemiAnalysis’s reporting of 12 SMT-130 turbines, rated at roughly 16MW apiece, on the Memphis side, and seven Titan 350 units in Southaven, each capable of more than 35MW. Together, that brings xAI’s on-site capacity close to half a gigawatt, or roughly the output of a midsize utility plant, stood up in less than a year.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">xAI now has 460 MW of natural gas turbines installed and either operating or under construction. This includes 12 SMT-130 turbines at Colossus-1 and 7 Titan-350 turbines in Mississippi, located right across from Colossus-2. @elonmusk and @BrentM_SpaceX chose Mississippi due to… pic.twitter.com/dCTYjfK7oQ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1968420084214571512">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>A single Nvidia GB200 NVL72 rack is modeled at around 120-1302kW. Even after factoring in cooling and overhead, 460MW of generation translates to headroom for nearly 3,000 NVL72 racks, which is more than 200,000 GPUs in total. If xAI succeeds in doubling that to a full gigawatt, it would dwarf most hyperscale campuses in terms of concentrated GPU capacity.</p><p>xAI’s choice of turbine suggests a sense of urgency behind the project. Solar’s SMT-130 and Titan 350 packages are containerized modules designed for rapid deployment, essentially acting as bridge power while xAI transitions to the larger Southaven site. That speed helps sidestep the years-long queue for new grid interconnects, but also explains the geographic shuffle — Tennessee pushback slowed the Memphis approvals, so xAI pivoted to Mississippi, where regulators moved faster.</p><p>Compared with Microsoft and Amazon, which are experimenting with 100-200MW on-site projects, xAI’s goal of leaping straight to a gigawatt sets its power strategy apart from anything else. None of this means xAI is home free. The Memphis permit is already under appeal, and the Southaven authorization is temporary. Critics argue the company is prioritizing speed over compliance, which is a familiar criticism for Musk’s ventures.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> </em><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> </em><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ I managed to snag a Core i5 CPU for $10, because someone scammed Amazon out of an i7-14700 ]]>
<p>The other day, I stopped into a local Amazon returns store on my lunch break. You probably know the type: chaotically overflowing other people's returned orders, with half-open boxes scattered about in huge bins. It's like some kind of post-apocalyptic ball pit game show, where you might find something worthwhile if you wade through enough discarded shelving kits, no-name iPhone cases, and shoe insoles. This particular store is only a few months old, and I'd visited a few times without finding much (other than a pair of insoles, which I needed because I walk 9-10 miles a day).</p><p>On this trip, the first day after a weekly restock, when everything in the bins costs $10, I managed to find a roll of Creality 3D printer PLA filament. That's not a huge discount over its typical Amazon sale price, but I happened to need a new spool for my Anycubic printer, and I was a few blocks from home, so this saved me the hassle of ordering. After a few more minutes pawing through returns, I hadn't found anything else and went up to pay. But there was a line, and I wound up waiting at the corner of one of the closest bins to the register. Killing time, I idly dug around while I waited, and soon spotted the familiar blue of an Intel CPU box. I flipped it over and saw an i7-14700 sticker!<br><br>Could I really have just found the frequency-locked version of Intel's last-generation flagship for $10? And if so, had someone returned it because of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/raptor-lake-instability-saga-continues-as-intel-releases-0x12f-update-to-fix-vmin-instability"> <u>notorious instability issues</u></a>? Something else? I could see the CPU in its plastic clamshell through the cardboard window. The back looked OK, but the top was covered in thermal paste.</p><p>I was suspicious, but by this time, I was next in line, curious, and decided to gamble $10 on Intel. That’s maybe not the smartest wager I could make in 2025, but I was curious, and figured this would at least be more interesting than wasting money on a scratch-off ticket. I checked out with three items: the filament, the CPU, and another pair of shoe insoles – seriously, I wear those things out and can never have enough.</p><p>After paying my $32.25 after tax, I stepped outside, wishing I had a napkin to immediately wipe the thermal paste off with. Instead, I slacked my coworkers about what I had found, while I marched back to my apartment. When I got home, I immediately opened the CPU box, grabbed a paper towel, and wiped the used thermal paste off the CPU's IHS, to be met with immediate disappointment. This wasn't a 14th Gen Core i7 after all!</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Not quite one of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html"><u> best CPUs</u></a>, and a generation older than what the box promised, but still a very usable chip, with 14 cores, 20 threads, and a Turbo Frequency of 4.8 GHz. It's not the fastest chip, but it currently sells for $264 at Newegg – not a bad pickup for $10. If it works, anyway.</p><p>So why was a 13th Gen Core i5 returned in a Core i7-14700 box? For those who haven't already connected the dots, it's likely that someone scammed Amazon by buying a new, higher-end chip than what they had, put the old one back in the box (helpfully obscured by thermal paste), and returned it for a refund. And Amazon, dealing as it does with millions of packages a day, seemingly accepted the return without checking that the returned product was actually what was returned, eventually selling it as part of a lot of liquidated returns.</p><p>I have no way to verify any of this, of course, but it seems the most likely scenario. And it's certainly unsurprising that Amazon would just accept a return without paying someone to open the box, wipe off the thermal paste, and confirm they had received the Core i7-14700 the customer had ordered. There's no way Amazon could continue to run its business if it had to do something like that with even half of its returns.</p><p>The only lingering question I had was whether my $10 13th Gen Core i5 CPU actually works. So I grabbed my trusty Hoto screwdriver, removed the AIO waterblock on the system that previously served as our external SSD storage testbed, and removed the 12th Gen Core i5 CPU that previously resided in the LGA 1700 socket. I then dropped my 13th Gen Core i5 into the motherboard, applied<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/apply-thermal-paste-to-your-cpu"> <u>five small drops of thermal paste</u></a>, re-attached the cooler, and plugged the system back in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The old system booted up without an issue, and after running a few benchmarks, it looks like my $10 chip performs as expected.</p><p>Now the only question is, what should I do with it? I don't need another gaming rig – I'm writing this on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-ryzen-5-7600x-cpu-review"><u>AMD Ryzen 7950X</u></a> / <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review"><u>Nvidia RTX 4090</u></a> PC I built back in 2023, and I already have a few other systems and CPUs for testing PC cases and accessories. Maybe I'll build a system for a family member or friend.</p><p>All I know is, while it didn't turn out to be a 14th Gen Core i7 promised on the box, I'm happy with the results of my $10 CPU gamble, and I wonder what I'll find at the returns store next week. I don't really need any more PC hardware, but if I could pass up enticing tech that I don't really need, I probably wouldn't have gotten into this crazy business in the first place.</p>

<p>The upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 was formally announced a few days ago, but now Geekbench leaks are rolling in. <br><br>The keen-eyed X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/never_released/status/1968418182961496131?s=31" target="_blank">Longhorn</a> noticed an unnamed Xiaomi 25113PN0EC device (possibly a Xiaomi 17 Pro) with the Qualcomm SoC inside, posting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13864869" target="_blank">whopping 3,831-point</a> single-threaded score, a value that should put it head-to-head with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apples-a19-pro-beats-ryzen-9-9950x-in-single-thread-geekbench-tests-iphone-17-pro-chip-packs-11-12-percent-cpu-performance-bump-gpu-performance-up-37-percent-over-predecessor"> Apple's A19 Pro SoC</a> inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-debuts-a19-and-a19-pro-processors-for-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro">iPhone 17 Pro</a>.</p><p>If that figure is reflective of shipping products, that would be quite the leap for Qualcomm's chips. The company's SoCs have historically trailed Apple's designs by some margin in both performance and efficiency, so catching up would be quite the feat. The A19 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apples-a19-pro-beats-ryzen-9-9950x-in-single-thread-geekbench-tests-iphone-17-pro-chip-packs-11-12-percent-cpu-performance-bump-gpu-performance-up-37-percent-over-predecessor">rings in at close to 3,900</a> points in Geekbench. To put this into perspective, even the mighty Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D post scores of about 3,400 and 3,500, respectively. That's by no means an ultimate measure of real-world performance, but it does display the might of contemporary Arm-based chips, at least in power-constrained scenarios.</p><p>The 3,831-point figure for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 might sound a little too good to be true — particularly as it would mean a generational uplift of over 34% — but it is at least consistent with leaks that showed a purported Samsung handset <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hothardware.com/news/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-2-impresses-in-early-benchmarks-running-at-474ghz" target="_blank">displaying a score of nearly 3,400</a> at only a 4 GHz boost clock speed. Per Qualcomm's recent announcement, the chip uses two performance cores and six efficiency cores, with the performance cores hitting 4.61 GHz in the standard configuration, or 4.74 GHz in a Samsung Galaxy-specific flavor. This makes 3,831 points at least plausible, as the recent score post shows 4.6 GHz for the performance cores. The new SoC is manufactured in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track.">TSMC's 3-nm N3P node</a>, an evolution of the previous N3E.</p><div ><table><caption>Geekbench scores</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 @ 4.6 GHz</p></td><td

><p>~2,850</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That's not the only noteworthy difference, though. Longhorn points out in their X post that "SVE2 and SME say hello", implying that the new chip ought to support the newer versions of Arm's Scalable Vector Instructions and Scalable Matrix Instructions. Both
of these CPU instruction sets are called "SIMD" (Single Instruction Multiple Operation), making it easy for developers to efficiently process chunks of data at a time with few instructions.</p><p>That means that applications that can make use of those instructions should see quite a significant speed boost. The original SVE was designed for AI-related data processing, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102340/0100/Introducing-SVE2" target="_blank">Arm says that SVE2</a> should cover more broad uses cases, and calls out general-purpose software, multimedia, computer vision, and in-memory databases. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2024/04/geekbench-63/" target="_blank">Geekbench does use SME</a> (which in turn apparently needs a subset of SVE2), so the posted scores should reflect the use of these optimizations.</p><p>By the way, if the "Gen 5" name in this report is throwing you off, know that you're not alone. Many people thought the new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC would be called "Gen 2", but Qualcomm has decided that the "Gen" suffix now applies to its series of Snapdragon products, making this chip the fifth generation, across Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, with the original Snapdragon 8 Elite counting as "Gen 4".</p><p>Of course, consider that these recently-posted figures originate from leakers around the globe and may not reflect production silicon, clock-speed targets, or power envelopes of their final devices. Second, although Geekbench single-core results mostly track with general application performance, that may not be true of every scenario. Regardless, even if figures for production Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices are somewhat lower, that would still be an impressive showing.</p>

<![CDATA[ Silverstone's retro PC FLP02 case launches
— throw-back 5.25-inch expansion bays meet modern 360mm radiator support, likely to be $240 in the US ]]>
<p><strong>09/18/25 update: </strong><em>A few hours after initial publication, a representative from Silverstone reached out to say that the U.S. price for the FLP02 had not yet been set, but that it will likely be around
$240. We changed the headline and removed a reference to a $220 U.S. MSRP at the end of the article.</em><br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside">Initially presented</a> at Computex 2025, Silverstone has launched its new FLP02 (SST-FLP02), a retro-inspired PC case designed to house modern hardware components. The FLP02 is the second old-school-looking case introduced by Silverstone, following the successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/retro-pc-case-flaunts-floppy-disk-style-bay-cover-silverstone-flp01-will-sell-for-around-usd130">FLP01</a>.</p><p>Silverstone manufactures the FLP02 using steel and plastic, and it is finished with the characteristic beige color reminiscent of the good old days. The case dimensions are 9.13 x 19.45 x 18.58 inches (232 x 494 x 472mm), a moderate size by today's standards. With a weight of 21.6 pounds (9.79 kg), the FLP02 is not overly heavy, allowing it to be conveniently placed on a desk, which is an appropriate location for display purposes.</p><p>The FLP02 accommodates mini-ATX, microATX, ATX, and SSI-CEB motherboards. Considering the dimensions of the FLP02, a mini-ATX motherboard may appear disproportionate within the case; however, individual preferences vary. The FLP02 is equipped with a total of seven expansion slots, with an additional two slots available should you choose to install the graphics card in a vertical orientation.</p><p>Regarding the dimensions of graphics cards, the maximum length is 15.2 inches (386 mm) when the front 3.5-inch/2.5-inch combo bay drive cage is not installed, and 11 inches (279 mm) when it is installed. In terms of width, the maximum is 7.4 inches (188 mm) without the GPU brace, and 6 inches with it installed. Consequently, even large graphics cards such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review">GeForce RTX 5090</a> are compatible with the FLP02 case. The case accepts power supplies with a length of up to 9.8 inches (250mm), so even monstrous power supplies, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/power-supplies/corsair-launches-gargantuan-3-000w-power-supply-for-usd599-99-comes-with-four-native-12v-2x6-600w-gpu-cables">Corsair's 3,000W unit,</a> can fit easily into the FLP02.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Regarding storage options, it provides one 3.5-inch bay and one 2.5-inch bay, each capable of housing up to two drives of their respective sizes. Additionally, there is a third bay that supports either two 3.5-inch or two 2.5-inch drives.</p><p>The front panel of the FLP02 houses a flickable power switch, a reset button, and a turbo button. There's even a special key lock that prevents accidental actuations on the power and reset buttons. Silverstone has incorporated a fan controller on the FLP02, where you can connect up to eight PWM fans. The turbo button essentially cranks these fans up to full speed. There's a cable that connects to one of your motherboard's PWM fan headers, allowing you to fine-tune the fans.</p><p>As for indicators, you'll find a green power LED, an orange turbo LED, a red hard drive activity LED, and a large digital display that shows the duty cycle for the fans that are connected to the fan controller. Front I/O ports include one USB Type-C port, two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, and a combo 3.5mm audio port.</p><p>The FLP02 will launch in the U.S. market in the fourth quarter of the year.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

More importantly, this model comes with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM — which is plenty already — but you can upgrade the vacant SODIMM slots to add even more. The same goes for the storage, you get 1TB PCIe 4.0 storage that can be expanded with the extra M.2 NVMe slot. In terms of flexibility, this is a clear standout among current-gen mainstream offerings.</p><p>As the name suggests, the Aero X16 has a gorgeous 16" screen, featuring a 165 Hz IPS panel with 100% coverage of the sRGB color space. It's no OLED, but the 16:10 aspect ratio offers a bit more screen real estate, and the 1440p resolution keeps things looking sharp no matter what. That screen is accompanied by a solid RGB-lit keyboard, trackpad, and 1080p webcam with Windows Hello. The Aero X16 is healthy in terms of connectivity, too, offering multiple USB-C and USB-A ports with fast speeds, along with HDMI 2.1, headphone jack, and a gigabit Ethernet port.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p>

<![CDATA[ Valve to drop Steam support for 32-bit Windows versions next year — says it's no longer compatible with core client features, only 0.01% of players actually used it ]]>
<p>Valve is dropping support for Steam running on 32-bit versions of Windows, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00" target="_blank">starting January 1, 2026</a>. Steam has been available on Windows for more than two decades and, therefore, was built with 32-bit systems in mind. Today, every modern computer is 64-bit, with compatibility layers built in to support older 32-bit apps. So, even though 32-bit apps have carried forward, there's really no place for 32-bit operating systems anymore — which is why Valve is axing support for them.</p><p>It's important to understand the distinction between 32-bit apps and operating systems. Steam itself is 32-bit, partly because it's from that era, but mostly because it doesn't need to be updated to a 64-bit instruction set, given its lightweight nature. A lot of games on Steam are also 32-bit. None of that will be affected by the sunsetting of 32-bit Windows support, since it's only support for the operating system itself that's being phased out. Windows 10 32-bit is the only version Steam currently supports anyways, and Valve says just 0.01% of players are still using it today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Valve has made it clear that 32-bit Windows is no longer compatible with drivers and libraries required for the core features of the Steam client, rendering continued support for it unfeasible.</p><p>Come January 1st, the client itself will still work for a while, but will stop receiving security updates, and Valve won't entertain support requests for it. The company advises gamers to upgrade to 64-bit Windows to keep receiving timely updates and assistance. This move somewhat aligns with Microsoft's own plans for Windows 10, which will completely lose official support next month. Steam should still continue to run on 64-bit versions of Windows 10, however, which makes up 35% of all Steam users right now.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Steam will stop supporting 32-bit versions of Windows from next year. Valve says the libraries and drivers needed for core client features are no longer compatible with 32-bit architecture, and therefore need to be left behind. Upgrade to Windows 10 64-bit, or Windows 11, to keep receiving timely updates and assistance.

<![CDATA[ A wireless device exploit uncovered 11 years ago still hasn't been fixed by some manufacturers — six vendors and 24 devices found harbouring vulnerable firmware across routers, range extenders, and more ]]>
<p>NetRise has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.netrise.io/hubfs/Pixie-Dust-Report.pdf" target="_blank">revealed</a> (PDF) that wireless devices from several manufacturers remain vulnerable to the Pixie Dust exploit disclosed in 2014, even though companies have had over a decade to harden their products against the well-known security flaw.</p><p>"Across six vendors, we found 24 devices, including routers, range extenders, access points, and hybrid Wi-Fi/powerline products, with firmware that was released vulnerable to Pixie Dust," NetRise said. "The oldest vulnerable firmware in the set dates to Sept. 2017, nearly three years after public disclosure of the Pixie Dust exploit. On average, vulnerable releases occurred 7.7 years after the exploit was first published."</p><p><em>SecurityWeek </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.securityweek.com/decade-old-pixie-dust-wi-fi-hack-still-impacts-many-devices/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Pixie Dust can be "exploited to obtain a router’s [Wi-Fi Protected Setup] PIN and connect to the targeted wireless network without needing its password." All someone has to do to take advantage of this exploit is make sure they're within range of the network they want to access, capture the initial WPS handshake between the network and a client device, and then crack the PIN offline.</p><p>Pixie Dust is so well-known that numerous resources use it to demonstrate introductory wireless network hacking techniques. Researchers have also developed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/wiire-a/pixiewps" target="_blank">several</a> open source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x" target="_blank">tools</a> capable of exploiting Pixie Dust—one of which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kali.org/tools/reaver/#reaver-1" target="_blank">highlighted</a> by the security-focused Kali Linux distribution—so manufacturers can't really feign ignorance about the ease with which vulnerable devices can be hacked.</p><p>An exploit this old remaining viable on dated hardware wouldn't necessarily come as a surprise; most companies release enough products each year that it would be unreasonable to expect all of them to be fully supported in perpetuity. (Even if there <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/windows-10-support-is-ending-but-end-of-10-wants-you-to-switch-to-linux" target="_blank">are many people</a> who don't want to upgrade to a newer gizmo.) But that doesn't seem to be what's happening with the devices NetRise scrutinized for its report.</p><p>"Of the 24 devices, only four were ever patched, and these patches arrived late," NetRise said. "As of this writing, thirteen devices remain actively supported but unpatched. Another seven reached end of life without ever receiving fixes. In some cases, vendors described fixes vaguely in changelogs as, 'Fixed some security vulnerability,' with no acknowledgement of Pixie Dust."</p><p>This means six manufacturers released products with known vulnerabilities and, in many cases, have neglected to update the relevant firmware even though their customers have been assured the products are still being supported. Even the products that received patches did so long after the fact—NetRise said on average Pixie Dust patches arrived 9.6 years after the exploit's public disclosure.</p><p>"The Pixie Dust exploit is not an isolated case but a symptom of systemic issues in firmware supply chains, from weak cryptography and poor entropy generation to opaque vendor patch practices," NetRise said. "The lesson is clear: without consistent visibility into firmware, organizations cannot assume that old exploits are gone."</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ China foes get worse results using DeepSeek, research suggests — CrowdStrike finds nearly twice as many flaws in AI-generated code for IS, Falun Gong, Tibet, and Taiwan ]]>
<p>Research suggests that your DeepSeek AI results can be of drastically lower quality if you trigger topics that are geopolitically sensitive or banned in China. During tests undertaken by U.S. security firm CrowdStrike, it was observed that code generated for a professed Islamic State militant group computer system contained nearly twice as many flaws as it would otherwise have had. Other potential topics included: Falun Gong, Tibet, and Taiwan, according to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/09/16/deepseek-ai-security/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a> report.</p><p>One of the key findings, highlighted by the source, is that DeepSeek AI-generated code for a program to run an industrial control system would typically result in 22.8% of the code featuring flaws. If requested on behalf of an Islamic State project, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-and-open-ai-investigate-whether-deepseek-illicitly-obtained-data-from-chatgpt">DeepSeek user</a> could see that the flaw percentage rises sharply, to 42.1%.</p><p>Rather than delivering faulty code, DeepSeek would sometimes refuse to generate code for the likes of professed Islamic State backers or devotees of the spiritual movement Falun Gong. Refusals to aid those groups would occur 61% and 45% of the time, respectively. Notably, both movements are banned in China.</p><p>However, DeepSeek’s perceived reduction of the quality of code, when it is generated for such organizations and others, has surprised some. “That is something people have worried about — largely without evidence,” Helen Toner, from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, told the Washington Post.</p><p>DeepSeek’s reasons behind the downgrading of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/linux-distros-ban-tainted-ai-generated-code">AI-generated code</a> for purported use in places like Tibet and Taiwan may be less clear-cut. But such code was also less flawed than that generated for the Islamic State, for example.</p><h2 id="what-is-happening-a-few-theories-2">What is happening? A few theories.</h2><p>The Washington Post has sought comment from the makers of DeepSeek regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/crowdstrikes-market-cap-falls-dollar125-billion-in-wake-of-global-outage">CrowdStrike</a>’s research findings, but has yet to get a response. It has a few theories about what might be happening, though…</p><p>One of the possibilities the source muses over is that sneakily producing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/firmware-flaw-affects-numerous-generations-of-intel-cpus-uefi-code-execution-vulnerability-found-for-intel-cpus-from-14th-gen-raptor-lake-to-6th-gen-skylake-cpus">flawed code</a> is a less obvious sabotage technique, used to blunt the energies of foes. It could also provide a wider attack surface for subsequent hacking.</p><p>Another possibility is that, as the most secure code found during testing was for projects destined for American clients, DeepSeek is trying harder to penetrate this market.</p><p>The source also ponders whether code quality is impacted by its target market due to training on the existing regional material. It expects many more relevant training resources for coders working in the U.S. than in Tibet, for example.</p><p>Last but not least, perhaps DeepSeek is working ‘off its own initiative’ to supply more error-prone code to entities and regions governed by what it has learned are ‘rebels.’ All of these are mere hypotheticals, but the AI outfit is not without attachments to Beijing. In August, it was reported that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-reportedly-urged-by-chinese-authorities-to-train-new-model-on-huawei-hardware-after-multiple-failures-r2-training-to-switch-back-to-nvidia-hardware-while-ascend-gpus-handle-inference">DeepSeek switched to training its models on Huawei hardware instead of Nvidia at the behest of China</a>, leading to delays caused by hardware failures.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Speaking at the Huawei Connect conference on September 18, rotating chairman Xu Zhijun outlined the company’s first official long-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/chinas-huawei-hypes-up-chip-computing-power-plans-fresh-challenge-nvidia-2025-09-18">Ascend chip strategy</a>, with four new parts scheduled across the next three years: Ascend 950PR and 950DT in early 2026, followed by Ascend 960 and 970 in 2027 and 2028, respectively.</p><p>Huawei says its upcoming 950PR chip will ship in Q1 next year with in-house HBM designed to compete with the likes of SK hynix and Samsung. That’s a pretty bold claim considering HBM supply and factors like packaging and bandwidth efficiency have arguably become the single biggest constraint on AI accelerator performance at scale.</p><p>According to Huawei, the 950PR will feature 128GB of its in-house HBM delivering up to 1.6 TB/s of bandwidth, while the 950DT increases those figures to 144GB and 4 TB/s, but Huawei hasn’t disclosed how its in-house HBM is manufactured, what packaging is used, or which foundry is producing the chip itself.</p><p>Under U.S. sanction rules, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/taiwan-bans-chip-exports-to-huawei-smic-ban-comes-after-huawei-tricked-tsmc-into-making-one-million-ai-processors-despite-us-restrictions">Huawei is barred from accessing TSMC’s advanced nodes</a> and CoWoS packaging lines, both of which Nvidia uses to stack HBM around its top-end Hopper and Blackwell GPUs. If Huawei is working with SMIC or other domestic fabs, yields and bandwidth may prove to be hugely limiting factors.</p><p>That hasn’t stopped the company from talking scale, though. Alongside its chip roadmap, Huawei teased new so-called “supernodes” that will house thousands of Ascend chips. The Atlas 950 and 960 systems are positioned as next-gen AI compute clusters that, on paper, rival Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 configurations in deployment scale, with up to 15,488 Ascend accelerators in a single system. Huawei says Atlas 950 will debut in Q4 this year.</p><p>But big numbers don’t necessarily translate into performance. Nvidia’s big advantage isn’t just its silicon but NVLink and a tightly optimized software stack that keeps its clusters saturated across large model workloads. To challenge that, Huawei is going to need more than a boastful chip roadmap — a roadmap that has landed conveniently alongside demands from the Chinese government to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/china-mandates-domestic-firms-source-50-percent-of-chips-from-chinese-producers-beijing-continues-to-squeeze-companies-over-reliance-on-foreign-semiconductors">produce more domestic silicon</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/china-bans-its-biggest-tech-companies-from-acquiring-nvidia-chips-says-report-beijing-claims-its-homegrown-ai-processors-now-match-h20-and-rtx-pro-6000d">ban on procuring Nvidia parts</a>.</p><p>Huawei will need a proven end-to-end platform that can match Nvidia in training, efficiency, and model throughput for its roadmap to succeed. Right now, it doesn’t, and plans alone don’t break bottlenecks.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 2TB SSD Review: A safe but unexceptional drive ]]>
<p>The Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 is a solid all-around SSD. Kioxia is probably best known for its OEM and enterprise drives, and to some extent, its Exceria line of consumer drives has flown under the radar. This is a misjustice because these drives have a solid reputation for reliability, with generally few downsides with the hardware. Performance and power efficiency are acceptable to good, and there’s no unusual switching of the type of flash, unlike what we see with some other vendors. You can pick up one of these, including the Plus G4, and expect a straightforward experience. What’s not to love?</p><p>If there’s a cost for this experience, it’s probably found in the limited capacity range, middle-of-the-road performance, and, to some extent, availability and pricing concerns. This isn’t the drive for maximum performance or power efficiency; it’s not going to solve your needs for a super small drive or a large drive, and it might not always be a sensible option economically. But there are sales, and perhaps more importantly, some regions of the world have fewer reliable drive choices, and Kioxia’s Exceria drives might be more competitive. The Plus G4, in particular, also demonstrates what’s good about this class of drives – they can be used for any purpose while delivering a decent experience.</p><p>This makes it a safe drive to pick up if you’re just trying to put the last-minute final touches on a build. Maybe you’re not sure what to get, or maybe this drive catches your eye on a sale. Whatever the case, its greatest strength is that you can buy it without worry. Peace of mind is a value of its own. Kioxia’s SSDs are not fancy, and that, in our opinion, is to their benefit. We believe Crucial has a stronger hold in this market segment with the P510, but the Plus G4 is a good alternative, and it surpasses the P510 in enough areas to remain competitive.</p><h2 id="kioxia-exceria-plus-g4-specifications-2">Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 Specifications</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Product</p></th><th

There is a market for smaller drives, especially 512GB, and larger drives of 4TB or more. However, the statistics don’t lie – 1TB and 2TB remain the most popular capacities, and these provide plenty of space for most people. Crucial’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/the-crucial-p510-2tb-ssd-review"><u>P510</u></a> has the same capacities on offer for good reason. The Exceria Plus G4 directly competes with that drive, so we can’t act too surprised by this turn of events. With costs getting tighter in the NAND flash and SSD storage markets, it’s safer to focus on high-volume SKUs.</p><p>Currently, the Exceria Plus G4, or Plus G4 for short, sells at $142.99 and $209.99 on Amazon. This is way too high for the 1TB, and the 2TB is more expensive than the competition, including the P510. However, the Plus G4 is likely to be more widely available in other regions and probably at a more competitive price. The drive has modest performance levels of up to 10,000 / 8,200 MB/s for sequential reads and writes with up to 1,300 K / 1,400K random read and write IOPS. The warranty is standard at five years, with up to 600TB of write endurance per TB of capacity</p><h2 id="kioxia-exceria-plus-g4-software-and-accessories-2">Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 Software and Accessories</h2><p>Kioxia offers its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apac.kioxia.com/en-apac/personal/software/ssd-utility.html"><u>SSD Utility management software</u></a> for its SSDs. This is an SSD toolbox that gives a health summary of the drive and also lets you monitor the SSD in real time. The application also helps with firmware updates, password protection, and enables functions such as secure erase. The program works for Windows 10 and up, and it works on all of Kioxia’s recent SSDs.</p><p>It’s nice to see such software being offered for what are essentially client or OEM drives, but Kioxia has been pushing deeper into the retail space with its Plus line of drives. Most users are on Windows, and the software covers the most common functions, so it’s a respectable attempt.</p><h2 id="kioxia-exceria-plus-g4-a-closer-look-2">Kioxia Exceria Plus G4: A Closer Look</h2><div class="inlinegallery

The label states it’s a PCIe 5.0 drive, so that narrows things down considerably.</p><p>This is a single-sided drive at all capacities, so the back has no components. The drive lists its Physical Security ID (PSID), which means this drive supports TCG Opal. Phison controllers can and do support hardware encryption, but that feature likely adds to the manufacturer’s cost, which is why many brands omit SED support. It’s more common as at least an option on client and OEM drives due to business requirements, although typically you will have two separate SKUs for it, as is common with Micron drives.</p><div class="inlinegallery

For more details, see our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e31t-es-2tb-review"><u>E31T preview</u></a>. For a brief reminder of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phison.com/images/products_datasheet/ProductBrochure_Consumer_PS5031-E31T_040825.pdf"><u>specifications</u></a>: this is a four-channel DRAM-less PCIe 5.0 solution that can support an I/O rate up to 3,600 MT/s per NAND channel. 3,600 MT/s can be assumed to be 3,600 MB/s as consumer NAND flash transfers 8 bits, or one byte, at a time. There is overhead on these transfers, so the maximum bandwidth will be less than the channel count times this number. In this case, Phison rates the E31T for up to 10,600 MB/s. Eventually, these drives will be surpassed by 4,800 MT/s capable controllers and flash.</p><p>With four chip enable (CE) signals per channel, this drive can normally handle up to 32 dies without a problem, which is 4TB with current flash, although 2Tb dies would bump this up to 8TB. This is unlikely to ever happen, and for the most part, we’ve really only seen drives up to 2TB with this controller. This is something that frustrates the storage community, who see no reason for 4TB not to be commonplace. The reality is that it’s not cost-effective to run fast flash at that capacity when most of the market is selling smaller drives. 4TB drives can be found in other segments – on higher-end drives or with YMTC flash – and sticking to 2TB or less streamlines the production process for the third-party vendors. Flash availability is also a direct influence here, as QLC is in high demand in the enterprise.</p><p>Kioxia has an easier time with that since it manufactures its own flash. The NAND flash packages here are labeled TH58LKT3T488A8S, which are still using the old Toshiba coding. We already know these are 1TB packages with eight 1Tb dies each, using 218-Layer BiCS8 TLC flash. We’ve only had good results with this flash – see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD_Black SN8100</u></a> – and it’s proven to be power-efficient with low 4K latency. Combined with Kioxia’s usually reliable custom firmware, we expect only good things.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p><h2 id="comparison-products-2">Comparison Products</h2><p>The Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 is directly positioned to compete with mid-range PCIe 5.0 SSDs, so we arranged our test pool accordingly.

It edges out the Micron-fuelled P510 and lines up nicely with the MP700 Elite. The drive is performing exactly as expected, which, for games, is exceptional. High-end PCIe 5.0 drives are still better, but the Plus G4 is more than fast enough for a primary drive where you also keep all of your games. The only downside is that it only goes up to 2TB.</p><h2 id="trace-testing-pcmark-10-storage-benchmark-2">Trace Testing — PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark</h2><p>PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

Why is this so? Well, PCMark is one of those benchmarks that we know some manufacturers have optimized for in firmware. This also goes the other way in that optimized firmware could hurt a drive in this benchmark.</p><p>Client drives, with one application being for use in standardized prebuilt PCs for small businesses, have different requirements than retail. Getting fully specced for Dell or HP is actually a long and potentially grueling process. Client drives usually have a tighter performance envelope based on thermals, and reliability is a higher priority. This is one reason Kioxia drives have proven to be more reliable than analogous retail drives, even with spotty controllers like the InnoGrit IG5236 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/kioxia-xg8-review"><u>XG8</u></a>.</p><p>We’re pointing that out because a lot of the time, SSD buyers have a single priority in mind: reliability. This is a very difficult thing to quantify. Most of the time, it comes down to a battle of anecdotes. Well, Kioxia drives have a decent track record for reliability, and if a slight decrease in PCMark 10 performance isn’t concerning to you, then you should consider a drive like the Plus G4 if you’re weighing various options. Kioxia makes the flash on this drive, which gives them a leg up on understanding how to optimize for a consistent, reliable experience.</p><h2 id="console-testing-playstation-5-transfers-2">Console Testing — PlayStation 5 Transfers</h2><p>The PlayStation 5 is capable of taking one additional PCIe 4.0 or faster SSD for extra game storage. While any 4.0 drive will technically work, Sony recommends drives that can deliver at least 5,500 MB/s of sequential read bandwidth for optimal performance. In our testing, PCIe 5.0 SSDs don’t bring much to the table and generally shouldn’t be used in the PS5, especially as they may require additional cooling. Check our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ps5-ssds"><u>Best PS5 SSDs</u></a> article for more information.</p><p>Our testing utilizes the PS5’s internal storage test and manual read/write tests with over 192GB of data both from and to the internal storage. Throttling is prevented where possible to see how each drive operates under ideal conditions.

It <em>could</em> be a good choice if you want something that might last a long time in a predictable role, but usually it’s better to go with something less expensive that has a full five-year warranty from a known name brand. If such a drive goes bad, you can often get an equivalent or superior replacement. In some regions, this is more difficult, and Kioxia drives can be a safer bet than alternatives with unknown hardware.</p><h2 id="transfer-rates-diskbench-2">Transfer Rates — DiskBench</h2><p>We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom, 50GB dataset.

It should match the MP700 Elite, and instead, it’s a little behind, but this is expected. The Plus G4 may be optimized differently for sustained writes, which will impact its write performance in this test. Additionally, it has a different firmware revision than the one we tested on the Corsair. Also expected is the P510 falling even more behind, but this perhaps warrants more discussion.</p><p>Careful readers will recall that in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-t710-2tb-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Crucial T710</u></a> review, we mentioned that the T710, with its six-plane Micron TLC flash, can actually be faster at the lowest 1TB capacity. Likewise, the P510 is rated higher for sequential writes at 1TB – with the same flash as the T710 – in comparison to the four-plane BiCS8 on the MP700 Elite and Plus G4. This means that bandwidth-hungry buyers should lean towards the P510 at 1TB, while BiCS8 is potentially better at 2TB. If you care less about throughput – and if so, why are you looking at a mid-range PCIe 5.0 drive? – then we have typically found BiCS8 to have better latency.</p><h2 id="synthetic-testing-atto-crystaldiskmark-2">Synthetic Testing — ATTO / CrystalDiskMark</h2><p>ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products.

the MP700 Elite in ATTO, with a slight deviation at the largest block size for reads. These two drives are close to the P510 in writes, but they fall behind on reads starting at 256KiB. As all three are using the same controller, this is probably due to the difference in flash. If we had 1TB versions of these drives to compare, we could make a better guess as to why the drives perform this way. Most likely, it’s due to the plane count difference, as this can influence interleaving with superpages, probably explaining why the P510 dips at 128KiB as well.</p><p>This is reinforced to some extent by the sequential CDM results. QD1 sequential reads favor the P510, suggesting the higher plane count can be useful here. That lines up with our thoughts in the T710 review. As QD1 is a more realistic workload, going with Micron’s newest TLC flash has potential real-world advantages. This advantage disappears with queue depth. Also obvious here is that PCIe 4.0 drives have no chance of keeping up in bandwidth, and the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives are in a class of their own. The mid-range drives like the Plus G4 are still worth a look as they are less expensive and will perform well in a PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot if so required.</p><p>We then look at 4K random I/O performance with a specific emphasis on low queue depth latency. Yes, the ability of the Plus G4 to push over a million IOPS is incredible, but this class of drive is less likely to encounter such workloads. Luckily, the BiCS8 TLC flash does good work on this drive with top-notch 4K QD1 read and write latencies. It can’t match the Black SN8100, but it beats the rest. We’ve come to expect good things out of BiCS8 flash, and the Plus G4 doesn’t disappoint.</p><p>If you did need to use this drive for more powerful things, for AI or otherwise, it is certainly up to the task, but we’re not convinced it’s the best option for that.</p><h2 id="sustained-write-performance-and-cache-recovery-2">Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery</h2><p>Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache, which is a fast area of pseudo-SLC (single-bit) programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the "native" TLC (three-bit) or QLC (four-bit) flash. Performance can suffer even more if the drive is forced to fold, which is the process of migrating data out of the cache in order to free up space for further incoming data.</p><p>We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds. This process shows the performance of the drive in various states as well as the steady state write performance.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is a temporary mode designed to trade capacity for speed. The cache size will vary with how full the drive is, but when empty, as in our testing, the cache extends to over 435GB. When converting 3-bit TLC flash to this pSLC mode, you can have up to almost 700GB, so this cache is of a more moderate size.</p><p>Larger, full-drive caches are typical for low-end DRAM-less drives, while small caches are rarer. The P510 is an example of the latter, and such a scheme allows it to write more consistently, which is particularly good for external use in an enclosure or for certain workloads such as NAS caching. The Plus G4 takes the more common course of somewhere in between.</p><p>Once the Plus G4 fills the cache, it falls to a direct-to-TLC mode at 1.5 GB/s, which is a pretty good speed and matches the MP700 Elite’s steady state write speed. Both it and the MP700 Elite write in TLC for quite a while before finally hitting a folding state. This occurs when the drive is forced to wait for data to be moved over from the cache to the native flash before it can accept incoming writes. The drive can and will move some data over while in TLC mode, but depending on the cache size and drive speed, this may be unsustainable. Folding is an undesirable state as it’s slower with higher latency, which can also impact reads for mixed workloads.</p><p>Generally, any given drive is limited to the base speed of its native flash. This is why QLC flash inevitably gets very slow. The pSLC write state is so much faster than the QLC flash – and QLC can be just as fast as TLC in that mode with the same plane count – that the drive hits a wall more quickly and more drastically, especially as QLC is going from 4-bit to 1-bit instead of 3-bit to 1-bit. The relevance here is that the Plus G4 looks worse than the MP700 Elite in the long run in this test despite having the same flash, but that’s likely because the Plus G4 is optimized differently. Client and OEM drives aren’t designed for sustained writes and often have a tighter power-thermal envelope. The performance here in pSLC and TLC is perfectly consistent, though.</p><p>The one standout here is the P510, which, as we mentioned above, has a smaller cache. The TLC state is then <em>fast</em> in comparison to the Plus G4, but is actually <em>slow</em> in terms of what the drive can do – the P510 has no trouble recovering to 4 GB/s with enough writes. Take into consideration that it’s not realistic to write the entire drive and that interpolation can get messy when we do this level of writes, but the results still suggest that Crucial is being conservative with the P510. We previously pointed out that this might be intended to improve the “quality of service” that was an issue on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-2tb-t500-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>T500,</u></a> or it could be hinting at future external drive products.</p><p>This type of write behavior would be perfect for an enclosure where bottlenecks don’t benefit much from pSLC anyway, and a consistent write speed is desirable. However, for desktop use and moving back to the drive under review, the Plus G4 is adequate for even fairly heavy use.</p><h2 id="power-consumption-and-temperature-2">Power Consumption and Temperature</h2><p>We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider, especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ultrabooks-premium-laptops"><u>best ultrabooks</u></a> can have mediocre stock storage. Desktops may be more performance-oriented with less support for power-saving features, so we show the worst-case.</p><p>Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt, or efficiency, is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload, but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly, ultimately saving energy.</p><p>For temperature recording we currently poll the drive’s primary composite sensor during testing with a ~22°C ambient. Our testing is rigorous enough to heat the drive to a realistic ceiling temperature.</p><div class="inlinegallery

We already know from experience that BiCS8 flash is more efficient than Micron’s, with appropriate trade-offs, but the Plus G4 still falls behind the fastest BiCS8-based drives. This might again be due to optimization.</p><p>We would like to point out that among the E31T-based drives we’ve tested, some – specifically the P510 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/pny-cs2150-2tb-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>PNY CS2150</u></a> – have custom firmware strings, while others, including the MP700 Elite and Plus G4, have utilized standard Phison versioning. That does not mean there is or isn’t a lack of custom implementation, not least because Sandisk and Kioxia BiCS8 actually do not perform the same in all cases. That sounds unusual, as the flash should be identical; however, there are performance differences on some Phison controllers, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e28-2tb-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>E28,</u></a> based on early reports.</p><p>Regardless of the specific reasons for any differences, while the Plus G4 is less efficient on paper and has some minor performance quirks, the result is a more reliable experience. Our temperature testing backs this up as we hit a maximum temperature of 51°C, which is more than 30°C below the throttling point. This is an excellent result, making this a fantastic drive for laptops and other hot or confined environments. This is sensible since client and OEM drives often need to survive in low-airflow cases and warmer ambients.</p><h2 id="test-bench-and-testing-notes-2">Test Bench and Testing Notes</h2><div ><table><caption>Test Bench and Testing Notes</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>CPU</strong></p></td><td

You can get higher bandwidth, decent power efficiency, good all-around and sustained performance, and reasonable pricing at the most popular capacities. You can’t go wrong buying any of these drives, including the Plus G4, and that's a good thing.</p><p>If you want something less expensive, there are plenty of PCIe 4.0 drives, and if you want something faster, there are high-end PCIe 5.0 drives available.

Nothing much changes here, but the Plus G4 has its place.</p><p>We have the feeling that the Plus G4 would be a reliable drive that runs cool and has at least halfway decent software support. This isn’t a no-name brand slapping its name on random hardware. It’s a viable alternative and is a safe pick for a last-minute build or project. At the end of the day, the Plus G4 is not terribly exciting, but it’s a good SSD – not everything has to be covered in liquid cooling and RGB – and we can readily recommend it.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p>

<![CDATA[ Microsoft's new handheld gaming mode, exclusive to ROG Xbox Ally, has just leaked for every handheld running Windows 11 — all you need is the 25H2 update and a few registry tweaks ]]>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft and Asus announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/xbox/asus-partners-with-microsoft-launch-first-xbox-gaming-handhelds-the-rog-xbox-ally-and-ally-x">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, an update to the first-gen ROG Ally, now adorned with Xbox branding. Along with the new name came new specs, but more importantly, the Xbox partnership wasn’t just a token collaboration — rather, a deeply integrated experience finally meant to "fix" Windows on handheld devices. Hence, the ROG Xbox Ally would ship with a new full-screen Xbox app that it would boot into by default, superseding Windows 11 entirely. This was exclusive to the ROG Xbox Ally and was supposed to come to other handhelds later; however, it seems the opposite has happened.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1968436869982503121" target="_blank">The Verge's Tom Warren</a> reports that the full-screen Xbox experience meant for ROG Xbox Ally devices has leaked early, and can now be installed on any handheld running Windows. The actual ROG Xbox Ally is set to launch next month, which means that everyone else will get to enjoy Microsoft's new handheld gaming mode before the very device that was set to debut it. There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/" target="_blank">full guide on Reddit</a> that breaks down how to install it, and it's relatively easy to follow as long as you know your way around Windows. If you have a regular Ally, Lenovo's Legion Go, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/best-pc-gaming-handhelds">myriad of PC handhelds out there</a>, you should be eligible.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"
><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on">Guide for enabling the Full screen experience on the ROG Ally (and other handhelds)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly">r/ROGAlly</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The only requirement for this to work is the 25H2 Windows 11 update, for which you need to be part of the Windows Insider program. The build resides in the Release Preview channel, so once you've got that going, there are a few registry edits you need to make <em>if </em>you don't see the "Enter full-screen experience on start up" toggle right away.

<![CDATA[ China targets brain computer interface race with new standard — groundwork could lead to breakthroughs as soon as 2027 ]]>
<p>China appears to be moving fast to establish itself as a brain computer interface (BCI) leader. The nation's latest advance is the release of a medical device industry standard, the ‘Medical Device Terminology Using Brain-Computer Interface Technology,’ reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/883/421.htm" target="_blank">IT Home</a> (machine translation).</p><p>While many BCI headlines revolve around the Elon Musk-backed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/wearable-tech/brain-interface-used-to-edit-youtube-video-paralyzed-neuralink-patient-also-uses-ai-to-narrate-with-his-own-voice">Neuralink </a>system, increasingly, we are seeing breakthrough advances from China. Earlier this year, we reported on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/wearable-tech/china-launches-first-ever-invasive-brain-computer-interface-clinical-trial-tetraplegic-patient-could-skillfully-operate-racing-games-after-just-three-weeks">tetraplegic patient</a> skillfully playing racing games, and another subject <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/controllers-gamepads/chinese-brain-computer-interface-user-reportedly-plays-black-myth-wukong-other-games">enjoying complex PC games</a> such as <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>and<em> Honor of Kings</em>.</p><p>For a while now, China has let it be known that it will try to coordinate its broad range of BCI research and development talents and commercial enterprises for the benefit of its industry on a wider scale. Earlier this month, we reported on a significant milestone towards this goal, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-bci-blueprint">a state-backed blitz</a> coordinating ministries, planners, and regulatory bodies, and laying out 17 steps from R&D to commercialization.</p><p>Returning to our headline news, and another piece of the jigsaw puzzle has been slotted into place. According to the source, China’s equivalent of the FDA will implement the new BCI standard from January 1, 2026.</p><p>An excerpt from the official release shows that the new standard, number YY/T 1987 – 2025, concerns “Medical devices using brain computer interface technology.” As with computing, setting a standard in any field can be a vital advantage to early adopters in the market. Standards setters can earn a range of advantages, and widespread use and adoption of useful early standards can establish an entity (company, country) as a clear leader.</p><h2 id="the-long-walk-from-what-if-to-what-is-2">The long walk from 'what if' to 'what is'</h2><p>There’s still a way to go, from planning to execution of this broad strategy. And, of course, the acceptance of China-established standards outside the country. However, should everything fall into place, China predicts most technical hurdles to be cleared by 2027. Moreover, it expects to incubate two to three leading BCI enterprises with global reach by 2030.</p><p>In the real world, we know there can be a technological or performance gulf between China's claims and China's results. So it seems healthy to throw a year or two onto the stated projections to account for that, and the typical extra distance between inspiration and implementation. Having healthy BCI competition from China could make such devices more accessible to patients in the rest of the world.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Asus is 'actively investigating' ROG gaming laptop stuttering woes — Models released / sold between 2021 - 2024 affected by 'performance interruptions' ]]>
<p>Asus has acknowledged reports about an ongoing stuttering issue with some of its ROG <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/best-gaming-laptops">gaming laptops</a> that users claim has been negatively affecting performance and the user experience, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341121/asus-promises-fix-of-the-stuttering-issues-actively-investigates-the-problem" target="_blank">TechPowerUp</a>. The company stopped short of agreeing that an issue exists, but said that it was "actively investigating these cases," all the same.</p><p>"We've seen recent reports about performance interruptions on some ROG laptops, and we want you to know our team is actively investigating these cases," the Asus Statement reads. "We understand that smooth and reliable performance is crucial to high-performance machines like these, and we're dedicated to delivering that. Your feedback and detailed reports are invaluable, and we'll continue to provide updates and support through our official channels." It then thanked users for their patience.</p><p>The first reports of this problem started popping up earlier this week when GitHub user, Mohamed "Zephkek" Maatallah <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Zephkek/Asus-ROG-Aml-Deep-Dive">created a new repository</a> collecting evidence about the problem. They claim it seems to be affecting a range of users on various Asus ROG gaming laptops, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/asus-rog-strix-g16-2025-review">including Strix</a>, Scar, and Zephyrus lines.</p><p>The issues include stuttering while watching YouTube videos, audio crackling and pops on Discord, and random mouse cursor freezes. After attempting a range of more generic fixes, Zephkek claims they narrowed the issue down to a problem with Asus' BIOS firmware.</p><p>Using the latency monitoring tool LatencyMon, Zephkek discovered that a single CPU core was being bottlenecked by interrupt requests, in some cases for as long as 90 seconds, hamstringing performance and making time-sensitive tasks stutter while core priority is juggled.</p><p>Deeper into their investigation, Zephkek also discovered strange power cycling of the dedicated GPU, turning it off and on again repeatedly every 15-30 seconds, even when it's supposed to be consistently active performing specific tasks.</p><p>Zephkek concluded that there are actually three problems affecting ROG laptops:</p><ul><li>Misunderstanding of interrupt context introducing unnecessary delays.</li><li>Mishandling of interrupt requests that aren't properly cleared, leading to looping interrupts.</li><li>GPU power cycling that doesn't check which GPU is currently in-use.</li></ul><p>They even did the legwork to track down the first public reports of these issues and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/rog-strix-series/g15-advantage-edition-g513qy-severe-dpc-latency-audio-dropouts/m-p/809512" target="_blank">found one in August 2021</a> for a G15 Advantage Edition Asus laptop. They then discovered further reports of problems persisting with laptops through 2021 and into 2024, suggesting it affects multiple generations of Asus gaming laptops.</p><p>Asus has said it's looking into this issue, so hopefully it won't be long until it releases a firmware patch that fixes this for the majority of users.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia and Intel announce jointly developed 'Intel x86 RTX SOCs' for PCs with Nvidia graphics, also custom Nvidia data center x86 processors — Nvidia buys $5 billion in Intel stock in seismic deal ]]>
<p>In a surprise announcement that finds two long-time rivals working together, Nvidia and Intel announced today that the companies will jointly develop multiple new generations of x86 products together — a seismic shift with profound implications for the entire world of technology. Before the news broke, Tom's Hardware spoke with Nvidia representatives to learn more details about the company’s plans.</p><p>The products include x86 Intel CPUs tightly fused with an Nvidia RTX graphics chiplet for the consumer gaming PC market, named the ‘Intel x86 RTX SOCs.’ Nvidia will also have Intel build custom x86 data center CPUs for its AI products for hyperscale and enterprise customers. Additionally, Nvidia will buy $5 billion in Intel common stock at $23.28 per share, representing a roughly 5% ownership stake in Intel. (Intel stock is now up 33% in premarket trading.)</p><p>The partnership between the two companies is in the very early stages, Nvidia told us, so the timeline for product releases, along with any product specifications, will be disclosed at a later, unspecified date. (Given the traditionally long lead-times for new processors, it is rational to expect these products will take at least a year, and likely longer, to come to market.)</p><p>Nvidia emphasized that the companies are committed to multi-generation roadmaps for the co-developed products, which represents a strong investment in the x86 ecosystem. But Nvidia representatives tell us it also remains fully committed to other announced product roadmaps and architectures, including the company's Arm-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-project-digits-desktop-ai-supercomputer-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand-usd3-000-to-bring-1-pflops-of-performance-home">GB10 Grace Blackwell processors for workstations</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-unveils-144-core-grace-cpu-superchip-claims-arm-chip-15x-faster-than-amds-epyc-rome">Nvidia Grace</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-details-grace-hopper-cpu-superchip-design-144-cores-on-4n-tsmc-process">CPUs for data centers</a>, as well as the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-rubin-gpu-and-vera-cpu-data-center-ai-platforms-begin-tape-out-both-chips-in-fab-and-on-track-for-2026">Vera CPUs</a>. Nvidia says it also remains committed to products on its internal roadmaps that haven’t been publicly disclosed yet, indicating that the new roadmap with Intel will merely be additive to existing initiatives.</p><p>Nvidia hasn’t disclosed whether it will use Intel Foundry to produce any of these products yet. However, while Intel has used TSMC to manufacture some of its own recent products, its goal is to bring production of most high-performance products back into its own foundries.</p><p>Some products never left. For instance, Intel’s existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-granite-rapids-xeon-6900p-series-with-120-cores-matches-amd-epycs-core-counts-for-the-first-time-since-2017">Granite Rapids</a> data center processors use the ‘Intel 3’ node, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/intel-reveals-288-core-xeon">Clearwater Forest Xeons</a> will use Intel’s own 18A process node for compute. This suggests that at least some of the Nvidia-custom x86 silicon, particularly for the data center, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-intel-test-chip-results-for-next-gen-process-look-good">could be fabbed on Intel nodes</a>. Intel also uses TSMC to fabricate many of its client x86 processors, however, so we won’t know for sure until official announcements are made — particularly for the RTX GPU chiplet.</p><p>In either case, Nvidia has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-in-talks-with-intel-foundry-intel-and-amd-know-all-our-secrets">mulling using Intel Foundry since 2022</a>, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-intel-test-chip-results-for-next-gen-process-look-good">fabbed test chips</a> there, and participates in the U.S. Defense Dept.'s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-foundry-services-wins-us-defense-contract-for-chips-with-18a-node">RAMP-C project</a> with Intel. The DoD project involves Nvidia already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-foundry-head-stu-pann-explains-companys-plan-to-build-arm-chips-move-more-manufacturing-to-the-us">making chips on Intel's 18A process node</a>, so it wouldn't be a total surprise.</p><p>While the two companies have engaged in heated competition in some market segments, Intel and Nvidia have partnered for decades, ensuring interoperability between their hardware and software for products spanning both the client and data center markets. The PCIe interface has long been used to connect Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs. The new partnership will find tighter integration using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-announces-nvlink-fusion-to-allow-custom-cpus-and-ai-accelerators-to-work-with-its-products">NVLink interface for CPU-to-GPU communication</a>, which affords up to 14 times more bandwidth along with lower latency than PCIe, thus granting the new x86 products access to the highest performance possible when paired with GPUs. That's a strategic advantage. Let’s dive into the details we’ve learned so far.</p><h2 id="intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-the-pc-gaming-market-2">Intel x86 RTX SOCs for the PC gaming market</h2><p>For the PC market, the Intel x86 RTX SoC chips will come with an x86 CPU chiplet tightly connected with an Nvidia RTX GPU chiplet via the NVLink interface. This type of processor will have both CPU and GPU units merged into one compact chip package that externally looks much like a standard CPU, rivaling AMD’s competing APU products.</p><p>Intel's new x86 RTX CPUs will compete directly with AMD's APUs. For AMD, that means it faces intensifying competition from a company with the leading market share in notebook CPUs (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amds-desktop-pc-market-share-hits-a-new-high-as-server-gains-slow-down-intel-now-only-outsells-amd-2-1-down-from-9-1-a-few-years-ago" target="_blank">Intel ships ~79% of laptop chips worldwide</a>) that's now armed with GPU tech from Nvidia, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-discrete-desktop-gpu-market-share-hits-all-time-low-as-nvidia-extends-its-lead" target="_blank">ships 92% of the world's gaming GPUs</a>.</p><p>This type of tight integration packs all the gaming prowess into one package without an external discrete GPU, providing power and footprint advantages. As such, we're told these chips will be heavily focused on thin-and-light gaming laptops and small form-factor PCs, much like today’s APUs from AMD. However, it’s possible the new Nvidia/Intel chips could come in multiple flavors and permeate further into the Intel stack over time.</p><p>Intel has worked on a similar type of chip before with AMD; there is at least one significant technical difference between these initiatives, however. Intel launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-hades-canyon-nuc-vr,5536.html">Kaby Lake-G chip in 2017</a> with an Intel processor fused into the same package as an AMD Radeon GPU chiplet, much the same as the description of the new Nvidia/Intel chips.

This separate memory package was only usable by the GPU. The Nvidia/Intel products will have an RTX GPU chiplet connected to the CPU chiplet via the faster and more efficient NVLink interface, and we’re told it will have uniform memory access (UMA), meaning both the CPU and GPU will be able to access the same pool of memory. Given the particulars of Nvidia's NVLink Fusion architecture, we can expect the chips to communicate via a refined interface, but it is unlikely that it will leverage Nvidia's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-details-grace-hopper-cpu-superchip-design-144-cores-on-4n-tsmc-process">C2C (Chip-to-Chip) technology</a>, an inter-die/inter-chip interconnect that's based on Arm protocols that aren't likely optimized for x86.</p><p>Intel notoriously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-discontinue-kaby-lake-g-amd-graphics,40577.html">axed the Kaby Lake-G products in 2019</a>, and the existing systems were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-graphics-driver-update-hades-canyon-amd-12-month-delay">left without proper driver support</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-kaby-lake-g-drivers">quite some time</a>, in part because Intel was responsible for validating the drivers, and then finger-pointing ensued. We’re told that both Intel and Nvidia will be responsible for their respective drivers for the new models, with Nvidia naturally providing its own GPU drivers.

<![CDATA[ Shai-Hulud malware campaign dubbed 'the largest and most dangerous npm supply-chain compromise in history' — 'hundreds' of JavaScript packages affected ]]>
<p>It's a bad time to be a JavaScript developer, after Koi Security <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koi.security/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack-crowdstrike-tinycolor" target="_blank">revealed</a> yesterday that it is tracking "the largest and most dangerous npm supply-chain compromise in history."<br><br>The security firm said the Shai-Hulud malware campaign "has now impacted <strong>hundreds of packages</strong> across multiple maintainers," including "popular libraries such as <strong>@ctrl/tinycolor</strong> as well as packages maintained by <strong>CrowdStrike</strong>." (Emphasis theirs.) And the problem is probably going to get worse before it gets better, because the malware in question is a worm that autonomously spreads from package to package.<br><br>"Attackers published malicious versions of @ctrl/tinycolor and other npm packages, injecting a large obfuscated script (bundle.js) that executes automatically during installation," Koi Security said in the blog post revealing this campaign. "This payload repackages and republishes maintainer projects, enabling the malware to <strong>spread laterally across related packages</strong> without direct developer involvement."<br><br>To be clear: This campaign is distinct from the incident that we covered on Sept. 9, which saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/javascript-packages-with-billions-of-downloads-were-injected-with-malicious-code-in-worlds-largest-supply-chain-hack-geared-to-steal-crypto-a-phishing-email-is-all-it-took-to-undermine-npm-packages" target="_blank">multiple npm packages</a> with billions of weekly downloads compromised in a bid to steal cryptocurrency. The ecosystem is the same — attackers have clearly realized the GitHub-owned npm package registry for the Node.js ecosystem is a valuable target—but whoever's behind the Shai-Hulud campaign is after more than just some Bitcoin.<br><br>"The injected script performs <strong>credential harvesting and persistence operations</strong>," Koi Security said. "It runs TruffleHog to scan local filesystems and repositories for secrets, including npm tokens, GitHub credentials, and cloud access keys for [Amazon Web Services], [Google Cloud Platform], and Azure. It also writes a hidden GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/shai-hulud-workflow.yml) that exfiltrates secrets during CI/CD runs, ensuring long-term access even after the initial infection. This dual focus on <strong>endpoint secret theft and backdoors</strong> makes Shai-Hulud one of the most dangerous campaigns ever compared to previous compromises."<br><br>That might be confusing to anyone who doesn't have to worry about developing and distributing Node.js software. But the long and short of it is that Shai-Hulud is using a well-known offensive security tool (TruffleHog) alongside developer tooling (GitHub Actions) in an environment that is designed specifically to help distribute software without much developer involvement (npm).<br><br>We suggested in our previous report that whoever compromised the npm packages to steal cryptocurrency did us a favor, because they could have used their access to those packages to accomplish far worse attacks. Now it seems that someone is looking to do just that — and it's hard to feign surprise when the Node.js ecosystem and the tooling built around it were practically built to enable widespread attacks like this.<br><br>Koi Security is updating its blog post with a list of npm packages known to have been compromised via the Shai-Hulud campaign. StepSecurity has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised#immediate-actions-required" target="_blank">published</a> indicators of compromise alongside a technical breakdown of how the malware spreads, what it does, and how organizations should respond if they discover that a compromised package has been used somewhere in their infrastructure.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Logitech's next gaming mouse will have haptic-based clicks, adjustable actuation, and rapid trigger — new G Pro X2 Superstrike will land at $180 ]]>
<p>Logitech's latest addition to its ultra-light wireless gaming mouse lineup has something no other mouse has: an "innovative blend of inductive analog sensing and real-time click haptics." What this means is that Logitech's new G Pro X2 Superstrike mouse will feature an analog system that allows you to adjust the point at which your mouse switches actuate <em>and </em>still get the real-time feedback of a physical "click," thanks to haptics. <br><br>Logitech's new mouse will feature its new "Superstrike" technology, which involves a "bespoke Haptic Inductive Trigger System (HITS)" that "combines adjustable actuation point and rapid trigger capabilities with an innovative haptics system." <br><br>While we've seen analog switches and adjustable actuation a lot in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-keyboards/best-gaming-keyboards">best gaming keyboards</a>, this is the first time we'll see it in a gaming mouse. This is because gamers <em>want </em>their mice to click exactly when the button actuates, and you can't have this without something like HITS, which changes the "click" to match the new actuation point. <br><br>According to Logitech, the mouse will feature 10 selectable actuation steps and five rapid trigger reset levels over 0.6mm of click travel, which seems like a fairly detailed amount of fine-tuning. But the brand does point out that the mouse is designed for professional athletes, so this makes sense. <br><br>Haptic Inductive Trigger System aside, the Pro X2 Superstrike will feature Logitech's latest Hero 2 optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 44,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 888 IPS and can handle up to 88 G's of acceleration. (This is the same sensor found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-mice/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-dex-review">Logitech's G Pro X
Superlight 2 Dex</a>.) <br><br>It will also feature up to an 8,000 Hz polling rate and offer up to 90 hours of battery life, albeit not at the same time. Specs-wise, the mouse will weigh 65g (2.29oz) and measure 4.92 x 2.5 x 1.57 inches (125 x 63.5 x 40mm), which makes it identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2">Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2</a> in size and shape and about 5g heavier in weight. <br><br>Logitech says the Pro X2 Superstrike will hit shelves in Q1 of 2026 for $179.99, so we'll probably see it showcased at CES 2026.</p>

<![CDATA[ PlayStation 5 Digital Edition with 1TB SSD downgraded to 825GB listed at the same price — CFI-2116 revision emerges overseas on Amazon ]]>
<p>The rumors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1967899998382952566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1967899998382952566%7Ctwgr%5E85f97f0baf6bbfa74ab49ae3fe800cdd6accf54c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fsony-playstation-5-digital-slim-storage-price-2000622679">billbil-kun</a>) regarding Sony's revision of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/playstation-5-sony-ps5">PlayStation 5 </a>Digital Edition have been confirmed through various overseas Amazon listings. Although the new CFI-2116 revision maintains the original pricing, Sony has decreased the internal storage from 1TB to 825GB, representing a 17.5% reduction in capacity. This change further emphasizes the importance for owners to upgrade their consoles with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ps5-ssds">best PS5 SSDs.<br><br></a>The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for nearly five years, during which time the console has undergone multiple hardware revisions. These modifications have varied from minor optimizations, such as improvements in heatsink design, to substantial hardware alterations, including a die shrink, culminating in the transition to the PlayStation 5 Slim models. Consequently, the most recent CFI-2116 revision feels like a regression.<br><br>The original PlayStation 5, colloquially referred to now as the PlayStation 5 Fat, was equipped with 825GB of internal storage, of which approximately 650GB was accessible to the user, depending on system updates and other variables. The shift to the PlayStation 5 Slim introduced numerous enhancements, including an increase to 1TB of storage, providing the user with approximately 850GB of available space (subject to similar factors).<br><br>The CFI-2116 revision, also known as "Chassis E," marks the return of the 825GB SSD, which Sony advertises on the new packaging. Consumers are losing close to 200GB, or 24%, of usable, high-speed storage with the latest revision. You could argue that 200GB isn't a lot, and that's true in a way since some AAA titles — specifically, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War —</em> are pushing over 300GB of installed size. But under normal circumstances, 200GB should be enough for one or two games.</p><div class="inlinegallery

If it weren't for past leaks or the Amazon listings, we wouldn't even know about the revision, since Sony hasn't officially announced it. However, given the current market situation, it's plausible that the downgrade could be a way for Sony to optimize production costs without resorting to another price hike. Sony already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/sony-hikes-ps5-prices-by-usd50-starting-tomorrow-sony-adds-up-to-10-percent-to-the-price-of-every-model-from-august-21">increased the pricing</a> for the different PlayStation 5 models by $50 last month, citing the "challenging economic environment." <br><br>This generation of gaming consoles is the first to experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/gaming-consoles-are-becoming-more-expensive-as-they-age-for-the-first-time-in-history-gamers-blame-tariffs-for-playstation-xbox-and-switch-price-increases">price increases</a> rather than decreases. Despite this, Sony has sold over 77 million units as of May 2025, so the company is eager to keep up the momentum. Instead of raising prices again, Sony may have decided that reducing internal storage was a better way to keep prices stable.<br><br>Sony silently released the revised PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe on Sept. 13. The console has already surfaced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Spain</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Italy</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon France</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Germany</a>. It's available for purchase at Amazon Italy and Amazon Germany for €499, which aligns with the European MSRP for the existing PlayStation 5 Digital Edition (Chassis D). Amazon Germany has set a delivery date by October 23.<br><br>Initial rumors suggest that the CFI-2116 revision may be exclusive to the European market. However, it's plausible that the revised console could make its way to the U.S. market. Fortunately, the revision only affects the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, so the disc version is safe. Nonetheless, if you're set on buying the digital edition, it might be a good time to pull the trigger, as there's no telling if or when the 1TB SKUs will disappear from the shelves to be replaced by the 825GB variant.<br><br><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

In the segment, T-Head’s new “PPU” accelerator was directly compared with Nvidia’s H20 and A800, as well as Huawei’s Ascend 910B, with a chart implying performance parity between the Alibaba and Nvidia parts. <br><br>The chip, an ASIC designed for AI workloads, features 96 GB of HBM2e, 700 GB/s chip-to-chip interconnect, PCIe support, and 400 W board power, according to the on-screen specs as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-war/article/3325894/tech-war-alibaba-developed-ai-processor-par-nvidias-h20-chip-cctv-report-shows" target="_blank"><u><em>South China Morning Post</em></u></a>. While the broadcast didn’t disclose the specifics of the testing methodology used or publish raw figures, it’s the first public benchmark placing Alibaba’s hardware in the same class as Nvidia’s datacenter GPUs. <br><br>According to <em>Reuters</em>, China Unicom has already deployed 16,384 of Alibaba’s PPU cards across its infrastructure, accounting for more than half of the almost 23,000 domestic accelerators currently installed at the Qinghai facility. Together, the cards deliver 3,579 petaflops of compute, with the site expected to scale to more than 20,000 petaflops once all phases are complete.<br><br>There’s just as much geopolitical context behind the CCTV demonstration as there is technical. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/the-tale-of-nvidias-hgx-h20-how-an-ai-gpu-became-a-political-lightning-rod"><u>Nvidia’s H20</u></a> was introduced to comply with U.S. export controls limiting the sale of high-performance silicon to China. Built on Hopper architecture but cut down to meet restrictions, the H20 ships with 96 GB of HBM3 and roughly 4.0 TB/s of memory bandwidth. That lends some perspective to Alibaba’s matching 96 GB HBM2e capacity, though not necessarily its real-world performance. <br><br>The biggest unknown right now is on the software side.

<p>When I think of MSI, I think of<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/motherboards/msi-meg-x870e-godlike-motherboard-drops-at-an-eyewatering-usd1-099-unleashes-ddr5-9000-ram-five-m-2-slots-10-gbe-and-wi-fi-7-alongside-two-usb-4-0-40-gbps-ports"> <u>motherboards</u></a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/msi-skips-rdna-4-and-will-not-manufacture-amd-radeon-9000-series-gpus"> <u>video cards</u></a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/gaming-monitors/msis-new-500-hz-qd-oled-monitor-leverages-ai-tech-to-save-it-from-burn-in"> <u>gaming monitors</u></a>, and, more recently,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/msis-brings-amd-based-gaming-handheld-updated-mid-range-gaming-laptops-to-computex"> <u>PC gaming handhelds</u></a>. So, the thought of MSI entering the electric vehicle (EV) was a foreign concept to me. Unbeknownst to me, even as an enthusiast with two EVs, MSI has marketed EV chargers in other parts of the world for quite some time. However, the company is now ready to expand to North America with MSI's EV Life and EV Life Plus EV chargers.</p><p>The EV Life Series is available in four different models: you can opt for a SAE J1772 or NACS (Tesla) connector in NEMA 14-50 (think U.S. dryer outlet) or hardwired configurations. No matter which SKU you choose, you'll receive an incredibly long 24.6-foot, IP55-rated charging cable and 14.4kW/60A that will add between 43 and 59 miles of range per hour to the average EV (think Tesla Model 3 or Hyundai Ioniq 7). If you're driving something like a Chevrolet Silverado EV with a massive 200 kWh battery, you'll probably see those numbers halved.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

With that in mind, the EV Life Series has built-in Bluetooth, which, when paired with the MSI aConnect app, provides a powerful tool for monitoring your EV and setting up scheduling routines. With aConnect, you can monitor current and historical charging times, how much you're saving by using electricity over a comparable gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicle, the total cost of the electricity you've pumped into your EV, and how much carbon emissions you've saved.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

You'll find the same four connection options (NACS with NEMA 14-50 or hardwired, or SAE J1772 with NEMA 14-50 or hardwired). You also get the same 14.4KW/60A charging capabilities as on the EV Life. However, the EV Life Plus amps things up with RFID authentication support along with Wi-Fi and Ethernet connectivity. The latter two features allow you to monitor the charging progress of your vehicle from anywhere, instead of the short-range limitations of Bluetooth-only support.</p><p>The EV Life Plus Series also supports the OCPP 1.6J standard, which provides a secure, industry-standard communications protocol for charging. This helps avoid vendor lock-in through proprietary standards, which is why MSI's EV chargers can work not only with Tesla vehicles, which helped popularize the NACS connector, but also with vehicles that use the SAE J1772 connector.</p><p>The MSI EV Life with NACS or SAE J1772 connector is available for $449. If you want to connect to your home's grid with a NEMA 14-50 connection, the price increases to $499. The EV Life Plus starts at $549.99 for a hardwired connection with a NACS or SAE J1772 connector. You'll also pay a $50 premium for a NEMA 14-50 electrical hookup. The chargers are available directly from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us-store.msi.com/EV-Solution/EV-chargers"> <u>MSI</u></a> or from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/741AAEE3-21A0-46D6-9F0C-073BFB4E34DE"> <u>Amazon</u></a>.
