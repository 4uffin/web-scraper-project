<![CDATA[ Microsoft’s pivotal Windows NT 3.5 release made it a serious contender, 31 years ago today ]]>
<p>The Windows 11 you use today is still identified as "Windows NT" in some ways, and that's because its lineage extends all the way back to the venerable Windows NT. Version 3.5 is widely considered the most pivotal release for the "New Technology" version of Windows, so today we cast a glance back at Windows' forebears, as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.5" target="_blank">31 years ago today</a> that Windows NT 3.5 released to the public.</p><p>When Microsoft first announced NT, it wasn't aimed at the family PC. NT was built for the enterprise, where Novell NetWare ruled networking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/hp-z400-workstation,2718.html" target="_blank">UNIX workstations</a> were the only type of workstation taken seriously by "serious" computing guys. Windows 3.1, the friendly GUI most people knew, was still fundamentally an MS-DOS front-end, and that means it was for baby computers used by baby users, at least in the minds of workstation guys.</p><p>By contrast, Windows NT was designed as a clean-slate fully-32-bit operating system with a portable kernel, preemptive multitasking, and protected memory. Dave Cutler and his team — many of whom were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/508-mainframe-computer-history-2.html" target="_blank">veterans of DEC's VMS</a> — engineered Windows NT with long-term ambitions that went far beyond Microsoft's popular consumer products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="VLUmwdwcVhqjLRQrqZczpF" name="windows-nt-35-program-manager" alt="A screenshot of the Windows NT 3.5 desktop, showing Program Manager and many application shortcuts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VLUmwdwcVhqjLRQrqZczpF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="960" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Windows NT 3.5 still visually resembled Windows 3.1 to the point that you could hardly see any difference. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft Corporation)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The very first version, Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, was more of a proof of concept than a practical OS. Purportedly codenamed "NT OS/2" during development thanks to its roots in Microsoft's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/preview-version-of-microsoft-os2-was-sold-for-dollar650-on-ebay" target="_blank">abortive partnership with IBM</a>, it was notoriously heavy. Minimum specs called for an 80386 with 12MB of RAM to really breathe — at a time when 4MB of RAM was typical and 8MB was luxurious. It was secure, modern, and forward-thinking, but the word most reviewers used was "slow."</p><p>Enter Windows NT 3.5, codenamed "Daytona." It didn't reinvent the OS, but it did the next best thing: it tuned, trimmed, and accelerated it. Microsoft re-engineered large swaths of the networking stack, making file and print sharing significantly faster. Performance optimizations lowered memory demands, and the system became legitimately credible as both a workstation OS and a server, purposes for which it was sold as separate products. Daytona was the release where NT stopped feeling like an experiment and started to feel like a real product.</p><p>Besides performance, networking was the star upgrade. Networking was such a focus of Windows NT that many people have mistakenly thought "NT" stood for "Network Technology." NT 3.5 brought first-class TCP/IP support at a time when the internet was just starting to break into public consciousness. Microsoft bundled utilities like FTP and Telnet clients alongside its revamped TCP/IP stack, allowing NT machines to connect to this strange, rapidly growing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/sir-tim-berners-lee-nft" target="_blank">world wide web</a>" with relative ease. Compared to NetWare or early UNIX boxes, NT suddenly looked less like a lumbering curiosity and more like a contender.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2263px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:119.58%;"><img id="h62d6mnMSpdvDvQUhV5WeD" name="dec-alpha-windows-nt-cover-art" alt="The cover art of the Windows NT 3.51 release for DEC's Alpha processors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h62d6mnMSpdvDvQUhV5WeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2263" height="2706" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The cover art of the Windows NT 3.51 release for DEC's Alpha processors. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft Corporation)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another detail often forgotten today: NT wasn't just tied to Intel's x86 world. Microsoft offered NT 3.5 builds for MIPS CPUs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chip-design-legend-jim-keller-aims-for-tenstorrent-wins-in-markets-not-well-served-by-nvidia" target="_blank">DEC's Alpha chips</a>, and even later PowerPC processors, reflecting Cutler's obsession with portability. The kernel was designed around a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), an ambitious idea at the time, meaning that the same codebase could in theory run across architectures. In practice, x86 soon dominated on the strength of Intel's fabrication expertise, but in 1994 the idea of NT as a cross-platform OS wasn't just marketing fluff; it really shipped on those platforms.</p><p>The interface, however, remained old-school. NT 3.5 still looked like Windows 3.1, complete with the classic Program Manager and File Manager. That familiar façade made it easy to use for folks coming from 16-bit Windows, but it also likely slowed adoption among professional users. Windows NT 3.51, launched just nine months after the original 3.5 release, made it much easier to write Windows 95 apps that could also run on NT by adding support for things like the Common Controls library.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uc4AC3ymGojCDehvAYcdrV" name="win-nt-hero.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Windows NT 4 Start Menu." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uc4AC3ymGojCDehvAYcdrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Later, Windows NT 4 brought the Windows 95 user interface to the 32-bit NT. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dave Plummer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>NT wasn't about looks, though—it was about laying the groundwork. By the time NT 4.0 arrived in 1996 with the Windows 95 shell grafted on top, the direction was clear. NT had won Microsoft's internal civil war against DOS-based Windows. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/739-history-of-microsoft-windows-2.html" target="_blank">Windows 2000</a> proved that an NT-based system could serve both workstation and consumer use cases, and this culminated in 2001's Windows XP, which unified consumer and enterprise under one NT codebase.</p><p>In hindsight, Windows NT 3.5 was a transitional release. It was the moment the "New Technology" started proving its worth. It wasn't flashy, but it mattered, because without Daytona, there's no XP, no Windows 7, no Windows 11 — just a world where Microsoft never quite shook off DOS, and where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/16-inch-macbook-pro-late-2024" target="_blank">we'd all probably be using Macs</a>.</p><p>For an operating system that most people never installed, that's quite the legacy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ SoftBank beams 5G to phones from the sky in successful stratospheric test flight ]]>
<p>SoftBank successfully delivered end-to-end 5G connectivity to standard smartphones using an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250918_02" target="_blank"><u>airborne base station</u></a>, in a live field trial conducted in June, above Hachijō Island, Japan. The company used a light aircraft flying at 3,000 meters to simulate a high-altitude platform, linking ground infrastructure to devices via a 26 GHz feeder connection and a 1.7 GHz service link.</p><p>Unlike most “direct-to-device” projects that rely on satellites in low Earth orbit, SoftBank’s approach uses High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) that hover in the stratosphere, about 20 kilometers up. That altitude brings big advantages like lower latency and fewer of the power and Doppler challenges that present challenges to orbital links. According to SoftBank, the service link in the trial operated on the 1.7 GHz band, which is already supported by most 5G phones sold around the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The system automatically shifted beam coverage every 60 degrees of rotation, emulating the behavior of a future stratospheric platform while proving that stable cellular coverage is possible with real-world mobility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

That design means HAPS nodes can act as intelligent base stations, not just repeaters or relays. The company also validated Doppler correction, automatic power control, and adaptive beam tracking, all of which are required for commercial service in the sky.</p><p>Compared to satellite-to-cell systems like AST SpaceMobile’s LEO-based platform, which previously demonstrated a 5G call from space, HAPS can cover wide areas with lower path loss and better spectrum reuse. And thanks to recent ITU decisions at WRC-23, operators like SoftBank can now deploy HAPS in terrestrial mobile bands, including 700 MHz, 850 MHz, 1.7 GHz, and 2.5 GHz.</p><p>SoftBank’s work could lead to 5G service in places where towers don’t reach, like disaster zones, offshore waters, or remote islands. The company hasn’t said when it will scale this to a full commercial launch, but the technical foundation is here, at least in theory.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><u><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><u><em> add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Notorious software bug was killing people 40 years ago — at least three people died after radiation doses that were 100x too strong from the buggy Therac-25 radiation therapy machine ]]>
<p>Software bugs can cause a lot of anxiety, inconvenience, and leech away valuable time, but thankfully they are rarely fatal. However, back in 1985 a radiation therapy machine called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac-25</a> was only just getting started on its human killing spree. There was a bug in its software which resulted in a deadly race condition, and at least six unfortunate individuals received doses of radiation that were 100x too strong. Three people died as a result of this software bug.</p><p>When launched, Therac-25 was an attractive machine for medical institutions as it offered a revolutionary dual treatment modes in one compact machine. It could be used for electron beam therapy to address shallow tissue problems, like skin cancers. Its other operating mode was Megavolt X-ray therapy, where a high current electron beam could target deep tissue problems. You wouldn’t want to mix these modes up…</p><h2 id="a-move-to-software-only-controls-2">A move to software-only controls</h2><p>One of the innovations delivered with Therac-25 was the move to software-only controls. Earlier machines had electromechanical hardware interlocks to prevent the kinds of radiation accidents that occurred during the operation of this device. Therac-20, for example, is said to have shared software bugs with Therac-25, but the hardware would block any unsafe operating conditions, even if the software malfunctioned.</p><p>A paper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/SWE/Papers/THERAC25.html">published</a> by California Public University computer science masters student, Anne Marie Porrello, details the nature of the bug / accident across the six known cases. For this fatal bug to manifest, typically, the Therac-25 operator would mistakenly choose the wrong operating mode and quickly try and correct their error. An experienced operator could edit treatment parameters so fast that the software skipped a safety check due to a ‘race condition’ between the input handler and the radiation beam logic.</p><p>Crucially, the Therac-25 took about 8-seconds to change radiation beam mode, and fast operators could confuse the software with inputs during this time window.</p><div ><table><caption>Therac-25: Radiation Accident Summary, table from Anne Marie Porrello</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Date of the Accident </strong></p></td><td

By that time, the FDA was also investigating the accidents.</p><p>In the wake of Therac-25’s killing spree, there were calls for formal verification, rigorous testing, and improved documentation for all medical software.

Someone may have gotten the real 5080 they wanted, took it out of the box, replaced it with a brick, and returned it to Amazon who didn't bother to properly check the contents.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"

All the scammer needs to do is match the box’s weight, replacing the 5080 with an identically heavy brick, and the scales tip in their favor (no pun intended).</p><p>In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Either that or, of course, an Amazon worker genuinely saw the opportunity and took the GPU for themselves. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. While we often find the fiasco entertaining — top comment called this GPU-brick the "Foundation Edition" — it's anything but that for the end user who is now just a sitting duck to the whims of customer service.</p><p>Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gkrnqk/newegg_sent_me_a_brick_instead_of_a_gpu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">befell another customer a year ago</a>, when purchasing from Newegg.

<![CDATA[ Commodore 64 Ultimate eclipses 10,000 units sold milestone — rebooted firm gives huge thank you to fans ]]>
<p>The new, reinvigorated Commodore has announced that its maiden product reached a significant milestone. A few hours ago, the official Commodore account on X shared evidence that the Commodore 64 Ultimate had eclipsed the 10,000 units sold milestone. The statement also offered profuse thanks to the community.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On behalf of the entire Commodore team, a HUGE THANK YOU goes out to you, our incredible community. Hitting 10K pre-orders of the Commodore 64 Ultimate is only possible because of your passion and support.Together, we’re not just reliving history, we’re building the future… pic.twitter.com/l2YJmQBBgO<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969552927724617988">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>If you unfurl the embedded Tweet, above, you can see the growth in sales charted for the C64 Ultimate (all models). Things got off to a galloping start from the get-go on July 12 this year. From August, we have seen more steady progress in sales numbers. Interestingly, the chart has markers on the timeline to coincide with the ‘Let’s Buy Commodore’ video trilogy releases. These videos got hundreds of thousands of views (one over 400,000), so the Commodore management were obviously measuring the media impact on sales trends.</p><p>Our last report, on how Commodore successfully <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/commodore-took-in-over-usd2-million-during-the-c64-ultimates-debut-week-roadmap-will-include-three-major-releases-a-year" target="_blank">raked in over $2 million</a> during the C64 Ultimate’s debut week, coincided with a video release titled ‘Making History: Signing the Commodore Contract + C64 Ultimate Production Update.’ We also saw a very positive blip in sales around that date. Perhaps people felt assured that Commodore was really back.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2fGP59mJ5M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In a quick follow-up to the 10K milestone Tweet, Commodore reminded its fans that “there’s still time to secure your spot in Batch 1 of the Commodore 64 Ultimate pre-orders over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.commodore.net/">https://www.commodore.net/</a> to make sure you’ll be among the first to receive yours this year.” Pricing for this FPGA-powered retro-futuristic machine featuring the “world's first transparent keyboard circuit board” starts from $299. Readers are reminded that the “Founders Edition will be a one-time run,” and we don’t have word on what will succeed it for latecomers – surely something very similar.</p><p>Retro computing fans should be cheered by this latest Commodore milestone, even if they aren’t particularly interested in experiencing a modern C64. Remember, the new Commodore has quite boldly claimed that it will become a “Founder's Sandbox,” for new computer tech projects. Its roadmap will feature as many as 12 major releases over the next four years – which should be exciting for all computer enthusiasts.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Radeon RX 9070 gains 25% performance in synthetic benchmarks using RX 9070 XT vBIOS ]]>
<p>In an attempt to squeeze more performance out of their GPU, a user on Reddit has successfully flashed the BIOS of a Radeon RX 9070 XT onto their non-XT variant. As per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nlpqx3/flashed_the_reaper_9070_into_a_fake_xt_boosted_my/" target="_blank">post by u/noVa_realiZe</a> on the r/Radeon subreddit, they were pretty satisfied with the results, as their PowerColor RX 9070 Reaper gained an uplift of 25% in synthetic benchmarks, and around 8-12% while gaming.</p><p>The user notes that they performed the vBIOS flash using an open-source tool published on Overclock.net by user Benik3. If you’re interested in the full flashing process, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.overclock.net/threads/amdvbflash-modded.1817620/" target="_blank">follow the post here</a>. Keep in mind, however, that flashing a GPU with the BIOS of another model may void your warranty and can potentially brick your card.</p><p>According to testing done by u/noVa_realiZe, the performance gains from flashing the BIOS were immediately noticeable in synthetic benchmarks. In 3DMark Steel Nomad, the stock non-XT card managed a score of around 5,821, while the same card with the XT BIOS went up to 6,461. After some more tinkering with the voltages and memory clock speeds, the card peaked at 7,277, which is a notable improvement over stock performance.</p><p>The performance uplift is reduced when it comes to actual gaming, though. In Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with a mix of ray-tracing settings, the undervolted stock card averaged 70 FPS. After flashing and tuning the card, the same setup pushed averages closer to 78 FPS, with noticeable improvements to 1% and 0.1% lows.</p><p>The increase in performance is primarily due to the ability to feed more power to the GPU after flashing the XT BIOS.</p><h2 id="not-the-first-example-2">Not the first example</h2><p>Back in April, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-rx-9070-vbios-flash-offers-up-to-20-percent-performance-boost-modders-claim-oc-beats-9070-xt">similar attempt was made,</a> where a community member at leading German website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgameshardware.de/Radeon-RX-9070-XT-Grafikkarte-281023/News/BIOS-Flash-1469905/">PCGH (PC Games Hardware)</a> took an Asus Prime RX 9070 and flashed it with the Asus Prime RX 9070 XT vBIOS.</p><p>After successfully flashing the BIOS, they were able to raise its power draw to 317W (up from the stock 220W) and increase the boost clock frequencies to 3.1 GHz. This translated into a consistent 15-20% performance uplift in synthetic benchmark tests, while additional tuning and overclocking resulted in scores that outperformed the stock RX 9070 XT.</p><p>It is interesting to know that the Radeon RX 9070 has a modicum of headroom to deliver more performance, but at the same time, these gains come with trade‐offs. This includes higher power consumption, increased heat, and a real risk of instability or damage, especially if the cooling solution and power delivery system are not adequate.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ President Trump posts an AI-generated image of him trading Intel stock inside the White House — imaginary share was bought at $20 and sold at $30, reflective of real-world prices ]]>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115228705834340561">Taking to his Truth Social platform</a>, President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself successfully trading Intel stock on a triple-monitor setup while sitting inside the White House with the sun glistening on him. It's essential to remember that the goal was not for the state to enrich its coffers through day trading, but rather to ensure that U.S. soil remains the place where the world's best chips are made.</p><p>A few weeks ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/trump-says-u-s-govt-will-take-a-10-percent-ownership-stake-in-intel-lip-bu-tan-reportedly-agreed-to-unprecedented-arrangement-for-a-domestic-chipmaker">the U.S. Government purchased a 10% stake in Intel, </a>an unprecedented move that is bound to shake up economic charts around the world. Intel has been struggling financially for a while, but it remains a homegrown American company and represents the United States' opportunity to lead the semiconductor industry. Intel was already receiving grants via the CHIPS Act to bolster local chipmaking, so the remaining handouts from that, combined with an equity investment in common stock, resulted in the White House now owning 10% of Intel. This investment appears to have been so lucrative that President Trump felt compelled to showcase it on social media.</p><iframe allow="" height="0" width="600" id="" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115228705834340561/embed"></iframe><p>In the picture, the monitor on the <em>far left</em> shows shares bought at $20, which is actually accurate since the real-life purchase occurred at $20.47 per share. The monitor on the <em>far right</em> then shows a massive uptick, with the share apparently sold at $30. That's also somehow accurate, as Intel stock hit $30 a couple of days ago for the first time in three years. Of course, the government didn’t sell its stake when that occurred, so perhaps it’s more of a personal achievement that President Trump is showcasing.</p><p>The mandatory disclaimer follows: this is not financial advice, but President Trump might influence investors and, more crucially, uninformed people around the country to buy Intel shares and HODL. Not to veer into whole tin-foil-hat territory, but any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-creates-u-s-investment-accelerator-to-manage-chips-act-and-negotiate-much-better-deals">future investments that the White House makes</a> could then become indicative of a seismic market shift, creating a bullish sentiment that pushes people to stock up (no pun intended) on equity in these firms.

An AI-generated image posted by President Trump depicts him buying Intel stock at $20 and selling it at $30 to make a considerable profit. These prices are mostly accurate, given that the real-life purchase occurred at $20.47 per share, and Intel stock reached over $30 just two days ago, although that rise can be attributed to the Nvidia deal instead.

<![CDATA[ PC second screen costs just $2.57 on AliExpress — but this sub-1-inch USB-connected display won’t be for everyone ]]>
<p>Second screens can be a great asset, and easily pay for themselves by precipitating a productivity boost. They come in all shapes and sizes, leveraging a broad range of technologies, but some products could leave you scratching your head about the best way to fit them into your setup. Especially tiny sub 1-inch screens.</p><p>A peculiar case in point we noticed today is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809755482417.html" target="_blank">the $2.57 WeAct Display FS</a>, listed on AliExpress. That price point seems irresistible for a highly-portable USB interface second screen. However, its postage stamp dimensions (it has a tiny 0.96-inch diagonal screen), means it is something of a curate’s egg. This tiny screen isn’t going to worry the makers of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-portable-monitors">best portable monitors</a>, but could have its niche use cases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1228px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.04%;"><img id="GNcLAhGfJbmuFStUjCfb8g" name="weact-1" alt="WeAct 0.96 Inch USB Secondary Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNcLAhGfJbmuFStUjCfb8g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1228" height="332" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WeAct on AliExpress)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The dimensions of the WeAct Display FS are more like a typical thumb drive storage device than a portable monitor. Specifications suggest the entire device measures 43 x 14.5mm, but we don’t have a thickness measurement to share.</p><p>Another significant way it strays from the portable second screen norms is that WeAct’s tiny screen doesn’t accept a USB-C or HDMI connection – it has a captive USB-A interface (again, like many USB thumb drives). The connector is reversible in this instance, with an insulator pad supplied for the unused side.</p><p>One side of the WeAct Display FS is almost entirely taken up by its screen. As mentioned previously, this has a 0.96-inch diagonal. Using a bit of math, we can work out that the actual screen measures ~0.429 x 0.858 inches (~10.9 x 24.4mm).</p><p>Across this tiny display, there are 160 x 80 pixels (thus a 2:1 ratio). We also know the display uses the RGB565 (16-bit) color format, delivering up to 65,536 colors, which should be ample for its touted applications.</p><p>WeAct reckons that its little Display FS device is going to be useful for both system monitor and media projection applications. Indeed, two Windows applications are supplied, which are crafted for these purposes.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Thus, it is theoretically possible to use the WeAct Display FS and this app on systems other than Windows. Any Python supporting OS should do the trick, but you’ll have to do more leg work to use this device as a tiny second screen on macOS or Linux, for example.</p><p>The origin of the WeAct Studio Screen Projection app isn’t known, and it is thought to be a Windows-only app which emulates a Windows display. It is shown being configured to replay images / video from other screens. CNX Software expects it to be able to be used as a full-screen YouTube video or photo gallery playback device.</p><p>If this kind of tiny second screen has you intrigued, but the WeAct Display FS is too small for you, we spotted similar but larger devices on AliExpress. Moving the budget up to $10.76 means you could grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809454190811.html" target="_blank">3.5-inch IPS Type-C Computer Secondary Screen,</a> which is advertised as a great AIDA64-based system monitor (a very similar screen is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ransanx-Installation-Computer-Temp-Monitor/dp/B0F3HSVK88" target="_blank">$26 on Amazon</a>). Stylishly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256809427129703.html" target="_blank">circular 2.1-inch IPS screens with USB-C connectivity</a> can be grabbed from $27.16 via AliExpress. But that’s a significant circular premium to pay.

<![CDATA[ DreamScene is (spiritually) back in Windows 11, letting you use videos as your desktop background — Latest Insider build finally returns coveted feature
]]>
<p>Personalizing the computers we own — whether it's a phone or a proper desktop — is one of life's few simple comforts. It can bring you joy knowing that your favorite picture will greet you every morning when you start your day. Now, movements behind the Windows 11 development scene indicate that pictures could soon be exchanged for videos. Microsoft has finally added the option to use video files as desktop backgrounds in the latest Windows 11 Insider build, and it works seamlessly, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/phantomofearth/status/1969399576026140731" target="_blank">@phantomofearth on X</a>.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows DreamScene is back!

It was a built-in utility that allowed users to put videos as their wallpaper... up until Vista. Unfortunately, DreamScene was pulled from Windows 7 and never made a comeback officially. In the meantime, alternatives like the ever-so-popular Wallpaper Engine rose to fame and replaced DreamScene in the zeitgeist. Many modern gamers today may not even remember that dynamic desktop backgrounds used to be a native feature of the OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It's available as part of the Windows 11 26x20.6690 Dev/Beta builds, for which you have to join the Windows Insider program. Once in, all you have to do is enable feature ID 57645315 and restart the explorer.exe process in Task Manager. After that, just open settings, and you should see .mp4, .m4v, .mkv, .mov, .wmv, .avi, and .webm in the list of supported file formats when you go to select a new wallpaper. Simply pick a video you want and you're good to go.</p><p>Keep in mind that this feature only works on the desktop, not on the lockscreen so you're not going to get those macOS-style aesthetic TikToks out of your utilitarian Windows system anytime soon. More importantly, though, since this is an experimental feature, there's no saying when it will actually make its way to the stable, public release channel — if at all. Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-11-is-getting-a-built-in-internet-speed-test-feature-that-will-take-you-to-bing-along-with-multiple-revamped-settings-pages-latest-insider-channel-builds-reveal-prominent-changes-coming-soon-to-the-os">native speed test button that Microsoft is trialing</a>, this feels like a fairly iterative yet obvious improvement that we should, therefore, see go mainstream relatively soon.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace brought parts of Europe’s airport infrastructure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/european-airports-race-fix-check-in-glitch-after-hacking-disruption-2025-09-21/" target="_blank"><u>to its knees</u></a> this weekend, after a backend outage hit the company's cloud-based check-in system and knocked out self-service kiosks across multiple major hubs. The software in question — Collins’ common-use MUSE platform — powers many airports’ passenger processing stacks, allowing airlines to share check-in desks, kiosks, and boarding infrastructure through a single backend. On Saturday, that single point of failure failed.</p><h2 id="we-re-going-manual-2">We're going manual</h2><p>Heathrow, Berlin Brandenburg, and Brussels Zaventem were among the major airports affected, with Brussels cancelling 45 out of 257 departing flights and warning passengers of delays up to 90 minutes. Heathrow said most flights were still running but slowed by manual fallback procedures, while Berlin suspended kiosk access altogether and shifted to direct airline processing.</p><p>Collins confirmed that the disruption was the result of a “cyber-related incident,” but has not disclosed the type of attack. What is clear is that the cMUSE outage exposed just how fragile Europe’s airport IT stack has become. Designed to be flexible and scalable, cMUSE can be hosted in the cloud or deployed on-prem, but many airports rely on the cloud variant, which centralizes passenger data and logic for easier airline integration.</p><p>According to Collins’ own documentation, cMUSE supports web-based agent stations, kiosk fleets, and mobile check-in endpoints through a centralized management plane. That’s great for cost and updates, but not so great when that control layer goes dark. On-site systems like bag tag printers and biometric scanners are often integrated directly with MUSE, so they’re not immune either.</p><h2 id="eu-directive-to-the-rescue-2">EU directive to the rescue?</h2><p>The EU’s NIS2 directive, which comes into force in October, broadens the legal definition of “critical infrastructure” to include not just airlines and airports, but IT suppliers that provide essential digital services to them. EASA’s Part-IS rules, in parallel, are meant to bring aviation-grade cybersecurity to exactly these kinds of shared platforms, including common-use systems for baggage and check-in.</p><p>It’s not yet clear how much of Collins’ cMUSE infrastructure went down, or how many airline DCS links were affected. But it’s clear that fallback worked only because staff rolled back to manual processes, not because systems failed gracefully. Heathrow said Sunday that it was continuing to recover from the outage, adding that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> </em><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> </em><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Repair wizard converts an RTX 4080 into 4080 Super using BGA magic — Donor board gets intense surgery for a reball upgrade like never before ]]>
<p>It's no secret that we're a fan of eccentric repair stories here at <em>Tom's Hardware</em>; we've already had classics like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/dead-rtx-5090-with-a-cracked-pcb-gets-urgent-surgery-from-repair-wizard-tech-casually-reballs-the-core-replaces-a-memory-chip-twice-and-runs-more-wires-across-its-traces-than-the-nsa">dead RTX 5090 with a cracked PCB being revived</a>, and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/botched-gpu-baking-job-is-fixed-by-a-maestro-chef-northwest-repairs-resuscitates-a-dead-graphics-card-by-reballing-its-core-and-memory">RX 7800 XT that was saved after a spoiled reflow attempt</a>. Today's tale is no different — in fact, if anything, this is perhaps the most we've seen one of our persistent GPU repair wizards struggle with a job. Spoiler alert, it works out at the end, but this RTX 4080 Super almost never posted, despite everything being thrown at it.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZeSKgwR8ds" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Tony from Northwest Repair got his hands on an RTX 4080 Super that he couldn't repair — not for lack of trying though (as you'll see), it was simply broken beyond saving. Our intrepid repairer, therefore, salvaged the working core and VRAM from the 4080 Super and brought in a donor PCB... which is actually a core and memory-less RTX 4080 non-Super. The discrepancy doesn't matter for a master like Tony. "<em>Board looks identical, so should work</em>," he says, and continues with the repair that will involve taking a 4080 Super core and mounting it on a standard 4080 board. A new VBIOS will be needed for the GPU to accept its identity, so the BIOS chip will need to be swapped as well.</p><p>The repair starts with flattening the donor PCB since it came from China, where it became severely warped in the process of stripping it off its core — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/underground-china-repair-shops-thrive-servicing-illicit-nvidia-gpus-banned-by-export-restrictions-companies-resurrecting-banned-ai-accelerators-at-a-rate-of-up-to-500-per-month">something very common in the region</a>. It was put on a custom heating plate with weights on top that should help straighten it some degree (no pun intended). After that, the soldering job begins. Tony casually solders the 4080 Super core onto the 4080 board in a beautiful montage, along with the memory modules and the BIOS chip, all while the PCB is sitting onto the heat plate, slowly leveling itself.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Tony ran a memory test, and it pinged two chips as the point of failure, but just to be sure he took off the core again to check whether it's sitting flat first. Sure enough, one of the solder balls on the core was much larger than the others surrounding it. Our repair guru wasn't interested in the why-s or how-s, so he just went ahead and reballed it. Unfortunately, it still didn't work, though the culprit identified itself right away: two data lines weren't connected to the core.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Taking off the core once again confirmed this notion, as the bottom left and right corners of the solder pads were not in contact with the core. These corners were at a lower elevation compared to the middle of the core, which is sitting higher due to the PCB being warped from the start; the weights didn't work. In comes new weights directly on the core itself, but they change nothing. Still, no post — even after thoroughly cleaning the interconnect to rule out the riser cable.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The weights make a return and after some tedious back and forth — and a Ron Swanson throwing his TV in the dumpster clip classic later — the card finally comes back to life. Usually the repeated heat cycles can warp a PCB but since this was one was already warped to begin with, it perhaps had the opposite effect.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Northwest Repair is back with another legendary fix, this time it's an RTX 4080 Super being transplanted onto an RTX 4080's body. The core and memory from an otherwisen dead 4080 Super was salvaged to be put onto a very similar-looking 4080 non-Super donor board. The task was far from simple, but Tony made it work by the end.

<![CDATA[ ComMarker Omni X review: a refined 5W UV laser cutter and engraver ]]>
<p>ComMarker has followed up its popular Omni 1 UV laser with the new Omni X, a similar 5W model but with some intriguing and perhaps compelling advances. We had the chance to have a thorough hands-on review period with the new machine pre-launch, over a period of several weeks, to assess how it ranks among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-laser-cutters-and-engravers">Best Laser Cutters and Engravers</a> in the market today.</p><p>So, what’s new? Top of the list among the new stuff is, firstly, the fact that ComMarker has made this UV laser fully enclosed as standard. Building on this feature, there’s a sensor-backed auto-stop function to cease the powerful and potentially harmful laser light output if this cover is lifted – or if you try and start a job when the cover isn’t fully closed. This safety cover moves up and down manually, using a handle.</p><p>Secondly, ComMarker has added an optional slide extension, effectively expanding the piddling 150 x 150mm galvanometer UV laser work area to a more ample 450 x 150mm area. As per the feature’s name, this new ability comes courtesy of a motorized slider that integrates into the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

</h2><p>ComMarker’s Omni X is quite a tall, imposing beast measuring 515 x 320 x 655 mm (20.3 x 12.6 x 25.8-inches), and weighing 32kg (70.5 pounds). The shipment came in at around 70 kg (~150 pounds), too. Once assembled, it isn’t ungainly, though. Most of the time you will only touch the machine to interact with the protective hood handle, to get to the working bed (which is bristling with threaded holes).</p><p>Access to the bed, various fixings, a finely adjustable platform, and buttons for emergency stop, power, and manually moving the laser head up and down are all at a regular table height, more or less. That is, if you place the Omni X on a regular table.</p><h2 id="assembly-and-preparation-2">Assembly and preparation</h2><p>This is quite a heavy and sizable machine, as shown in the specs table. Nevertheless, building it wasn’t a difficult task, as I would describe the device, as it was delivered already partially assembled. I spent a much longer time assembling the budget aluminum extrusion framed SculpFun S9 diode laser (with its pulleys and belts), which will likely become redundant now.</p><p>ComMarker had everything very carefully packaged, with components either obvious what they were, or clearly labeled. The provided manual guides you through starting with the platform, bolting on the height-adjustable pedestal, and then the laser head unit on top of it.</p><p>Quite a lot of allen screws were needed to secure the back/top cover, which is metal, heavy, and packed with fans atop. However, the trickiest thing I found was fixing the green safety cover. There were just two slim screws attached to the slider mechanism on either side, and I had to get help to balance this quite heavy component while it was fixed in place. If not for balance, I worried about screw, shearing, or cracking the green plastic.</p><p>Turning on the finished assembled machine for the first time, it is surprisingly loud. But the noise* doesn’t change whether cutting (or engraving), it is just the ‘ColdFront 2.0 thermal system’ keeping the UV laser components happy. ComMarker’s description of this cooling system as “quiet” might be relative to other UV lasers, but in PC cooling terms, it isn’t quiet!</p><p>I completed a rough test in my garage with a background noise level of around 34dB (fridge, gas boiler running, etc). Turning on the Omni X saw the dB meter read a sustained 68dB from about 30cm (12 inches) away.</p><p>* <em>ComMarker wrote to us to say that it was implementing a sensor to "add a temperature control switch to the machine." The purpose of this, based on early review feedback, is to reduce the fan noise when the machine isn't actually cutting or engraving. According to the firm, this change reduced machine noise "from about 71dB to 63dB," in its tests. Omni X machines that ship to paying customers will include this refinement.</em></p><h2 id="software-2">Software
</h2><p>I was advised to test this Omni X, a pre-mass-production sample from ComMarker, with the firm’s own branded new software package. The PC application installed easy enough and has an interface similar to other similar tools.</p><p>Central to the UI you see the canvas, which for most of my testing of the Omni X would be 150mm square. The toolbar to the left allows the creation of text as well as a few primitive vector shapes. These can be outlines (great for cutting) or filled shapes. Beneath these are icons to import a bitmap or vector graphics file straight onto the canvas. Then there are some more specialized tools.</p><p>To the right of the canvas area, a context-sensitive panel shows the laser marking settings for each selected object or group. Thus, you can place a few graphics and have different engraving intensities applied (for different effects or shades), If you were also cutting, you’d adjust parameters for the shape you were cutting to match the material.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This might be understandable, as this is new software, but I wasted quite a lot of time, moving through three revisions of the software. And this is software which isn’t yet properly documented and surprised me with some of its issues.</p><p>As of the time of writing, on the latest software, everything seems to be working as intended though, touch wood, fingers crossed, etc.</p><h2 id="engraving-and-cutting-2">Engraving and cutting
</h2><p>So, we have lots of engraving and cutting possibilities here. Some of these materials are confidently engraved or cut by diode and fiber (IR) lasers. However, the UV laser in the Omni X has its own strengths and weaknesses – mostly strengths though, as you should expect given the price tag.</p><p>To get ready for any job, you place the material on the platform and hit the focus button to the lower right side of the software UI. If it grumbles that it isn’t in focus, it usually manages it on the second press!</p><p>Next, you will want to check if the artwork you wish to laser cut or etch fits in the physical size constraints of the material. Click preview to see. You can also choose whether to preview the selected object on the canvas or its contour.</p><p>ComMarker supplies a green translucent paddle so you can check the preview bounds, as on many materials you can’t see evidence of the UV light bounds being repeatedly traced out by the galvo. This makes things a little tricky as the paddle is quite cloudy and about 5mm thick. On small, irregular shaped objects you can’t just put the paddle down on top, as it will slide or tilt.</p><p>The above processes apply to all jobs, but at some point before pressing ‘Start’ you will also need to load, input and/or adjust the Laser Settings parameters.</p><p><strong>👉 First test – Wood</strong></p><p>I am very familiar with engraving (burning) and cutting plywood sheets with my diode laser, so thought it was the best place to start. This was my first UV test!</p><p>Sadly, somehow the ‘continuous’ button, located just above the Start button, had been ticked by accident. So my first test of a material cutting and engraving matrix ran far far beyond the timer that claimed the process would take under 300s. As this was my first experience of the machine, and there are so many warnings about UV lasers, I thought it was a software bug where the 1s remaining dialog box would just go away a little later. I got fed up about 3 hours later, decided to hit cancel, only to find out my job had been ruined…</p><p>I talked with ComMarker, and they said the continuous checkbox was “mainly designed for long-running tasks like cutting through 5mm glass, where the laser needs to keep running without interruption.” They agreed it shouldn’t be alongside frequently toggled preview controls and right next to the Start button. They haven’t moved it deeper into the UI yet, though.</p><p>With that drama behind me, I found wood engraving and cutting quick and efficient on the UV laser. Indeed, the ‘cold burn’ technology here could cut the 3mm ply samples very cleanly and rather quickly.</p><p>ComMarker’s guidance had suggested 15 passes to cut this material, but I tested 10 passes with success, and even six passes worked. Of course, using fewer passes (if you can) means there’s less chance of charring, and it saves considerable time. In my example, moving from 15 to six passes reduced the work time for cuts from 50 to 20 seconds.</p><p>Engraving on wood was equally swift, with adjustments to number of passes, laser beam speed, and others providing different effects. Perhaps this is a weak point of a UV laser system, though. ‘Zero burn’ tech means that the wide range of black levels produced by laser-induced charring are largely absent here. Check out my other sample pictures to see what I mean.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>You can see some more wood engraving work as part of my feature where I make an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/search?searchTerm=apple+adb+converter" target="_blank">Apple ADB to USB converter</a> dongle.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Well, except for the output size being too big on the first shot - due to one of those software bugs I mentioned previously. The <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> logo looks great on this glass, even with one side ‘zoomed in’ like it was an intentional part of the design (it wasn’t). On closer inspection, though, it would probably be worthwhile tweaking the settings with the hope of getting sharper straight edges on some of the letters. There are various advanced line/hatching settings available.</p><p>I didn’t have any clear or colored acrylic samples for testing, but they should be easily within the capabilities of the Omni X, and I was given seven presets for different types of acrylic, and both engraving and cutting settings.</p><h2 id="bottom-line-2">Bottom Line</h2><p>The ComMarker Omni X delivers some worthwhile improvements to last year’s well regarded Omni 1. The safety visor is welcome, as is the 99.72% Dust Isolation feature delivered by the enclosure with suitable extractor hose attached. Another refinement here is the compatibility with the slider extension, as well as the existing roller/rotational add-on that fits the Omni 1 and X.</p><p>Standout positives included the UV technology at this laser's heart - with 'cold burn' and ultra precise 0.0019mm laser beam capability. Inherent to galvo type laser like this are fast movements, with the laser point capable of moving at a quoted 15,000 mm/s.</p><p>Pondering over negatives, we might complain about the size and weight of this device - which seems large given its 150mm square work area (without extender). I'd also repeat my grumbles about software teething trouble...</p><p>ComMarker’s software irked me during my few weeks of testing, and I went through versions of it which fixed one thing but then introduced a different brand-new wrinkle. However, getting the right settings and tuning to a sweet spot was the main battle – which can be the case with many a laser. I’ve talked with ComMarker about this, and they tell me consumer production machines will have all the correct calibrated parameters saved to the motherboard ahead of shipping. That way they will be out of the scope of accidental software tinkering. I’ve also found that the material library presets in the Laser Settings part of the UI have gotten better in the newer releases of the software. This provides a faster route to refining your settings for different materials.</p><p>It would be a shame if the software let down what seems to be excellently, sturdily built hardware. It is noted, though, that this UV laser is compatible with LightBurn software, which I’ve tried with good results before. Please note, you will need the $200 ‘galvo’ license of LightBurn to accompany this model, though. ComMarker told me the Omni X will launch with a USB stick for consumers, containing a LightBurn materials library and presets.</p><p>Personally, the UV laser is a big step-up in speed and cutting power, and opens up a lot of material flexibility. But machines like this come with a considerable price tag. We have been told that the Omni X will retail starting from $4,599, with bundles including accessories like the rotary and slider attachments rising to $5,099. And those are Early Bird prices.</p><p>However, if you have a workflow, or intended workflow that would benefit from the power, speed, and accuracy shown here, the outlay may be worth it. As is often the case, a wise decision is all about horses for courses.</p><ul><li><strong>Omni X Basic Bundle:</strong> Early bird $4,599 / Regular $5,299</li><li><strong>Omni X Rotary Bundle (with R5 roller): </strong>Early bird $4,859 / Regular $5,683</li><li><strong>Omni X Slider Bundle:</strong> Early bird $5,099 / Regular $6,044</li><li><strong>Omni X Ultimate Bundle (Slider + R5 roller + 100W Fume Extractor): </strong>Early bird $5,689 / Regular $6,947</li></ul><p>For alternative laser cutter and engraver choices, at all kinds of price points, please check out our frequently updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-laser-cutters-and-engravers">Best Laser Cutters and Engravers 2025 guide</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[ Iconic 80s Vectrex console reimagined for the modern day with OLED display, microSD, and wireless controllers — half-size Vectrex Mini could cost as little as $99 for early birds ]]>
<p>Retro gaming has seen a resurgence in recent years, thanks in part to a lot of cult classics being revived as fan projects, modernized to fit in the gaming landscape of today (or offer an antithesis to it). The latest in the line of these revivals is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vectrex.com/" target="_blank">Vectrex Mini</a> — a scaled-down version of the original Vectrex home console, now adorned with all sorts of upgrades that not only make it worth considering all over again, but also genuinely improve the appeal of the device to a solid retro machine.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Check out the Vectrex Mini prototype, the screen rendering is still being refined but seeing it in action already gives an idea of the experience...Full video: https://t.co/B44vUdMLm8Vectrex mini Kickstarter: https://t.co/2W0S7bkWNe pic.twitter.com/scmlRICX8J<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969099108351652188">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>For those who weren't around back then, the Vectrex is somewhat of a legend in the retro gaming community. Back in the 80s, it was already doing something different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://appuals.com/colecovision/" target="_blank">ColecoVision</a> and Intellivision — themselves standouts compared to Atari's reign at the time. It focused on vector graphics titles and completely eliminated the need for a separate TV. The Vectrex came with its own CRT display embedded onto the console, like an Arcade machine, that could display sharp vector graphics with their signature glowing lines. It was an all-in-one gaming system when such a concept was almost unheard of.</p><p>It flopped, unfortunately, but the legacy it left behind paved the way for a generation of handhelds and plug-and-play systems to come. The way its controller was nicely tucked away right in the console inspired the docking systems we have today; even the homebrew culture that's been the backbone of emulation can be traced back to the Vectrex — the community resorted to modding and making their own games since the library was so limited. Its design was also ahead of time, so while direct influence isn't where the Vectrex shines, its impact silently echoes through the years, making it the perfect contender for a revival.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The team has worked hard to keep as much of the original design as possible, while shrinking it down considerably. Given its "mini" nature (miniature?), the size has been cut down by about half and the screen is now a 5-inch AMOLED panel designed to emulate the look of old CRTs (we shall see). The controller is smaller, too, but it's now wireless and sports the same button layout and arcade-style joystick — though that might become cramped for some, but thankfully it seems like third-party USB controllers should be supported as well.</p><p>The Vectrex Mini is powered by USB-C, and features an HDMI port for connecting the device to a TV and a MicroSD Card slot to load up your own games, alongside the 12 it already comes with. The original Vectrex had a monochrome screen and used physical
overlays to "display" color, the Vectrex Mini will honor that by emulating different colors for each of the built-in games in software, thanks to the OLED display. All of this is currently in prototype form only, which the creators showed off at Gamescom.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A closer look at the Vectrex Mini prototype... pic.twitter.com/TbvNkV9FN8<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1958459304631271838">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Pricing hasn't been officially disclosed, but there are murmurs of a €150 ask, which is quite reasonable considering the original Vectrex now goes for upwards of $800 on the aftermarket. The Vectrex Mini will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1852390947/vectrex-mini" target="_blank">available through Kickstarter,</a> where the campaign will launch in November. There will be a special white edition for €219, too, with an exclusive badge and a certificate of authenticity to boot. Furthermore, we hear there'll be early bird pricing at just $99 for the first 50 units, and $129 for the first 200.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

<![CDATA[ AMD relaunches $40 dual-core Athlon 3000G CPU with new packaging and cooler — Zen refuses to retire even in 2025 ]]>
<p>It has become common practice for AMD and Intel to re-release processors from several generations-old architectures. Japanese news outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://akiba-pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/news/2047992.html">Akiba</a> reports that AMD has relaunched its entry-level dual-core Athlon 3000G with new packaging and a cooler, featuring part number YD3000C6FHSBX. The chip is on sale for ¥5,790, which translates to approximately $40.</p><p>The Athlon 3000G is one of the slowest CPUs you can install in an AM4 motherboard. The CPU was released in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-unveils-threadripper-3960x-and-3970x-ryzen-9-3950x-details-and-athlon-3000g/3">2019</a> as AMD's entry-level processor, succeeding the Athlon 200GE series that preceded it. The chip has two unlocked Zen CPU cores, four threads, just 4MB of L3 cache, a 35W TDP, and a 3.5 GHz clock speed. For graphics, the 3000G comes with a Vega 3-based iGPU featuring three CUs, 192 cores, and a 1.1GHz clock speed.</p><p>AMD launched a second variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-continues-to-sell-14nm-zen-cpus-in-2023">chip in 2023</a>, featuring a beefier Wraith cooler, new packaging, and a newer die based on the Dali architecture. Dali was an offshoot of Raven Ridge that was cheaper to manufacture, but based on the same 14nm process. As a result, performance is identical between the original and refreshed versions. One interesting tidbit about the Dali die is that it only features two physical cores; by contrast, the original Raven Ridge version of the 3000G had a quad-core die with two disabled cores.</p><p>The latest re-release is unsurprisingly based on the newer Dali version of the Athlon 3000G. The aforementioned part number (YD3000C6FHSBX) confirms this. Models with the letters "FH" included signify that they are the newer models; by contrast, part numbers including "FB" represent the original models.</p><p>It may seem silly for AMD to release an entry-level CPU that is now six years old, running on an architecture introduced eight years ago. But AMD would not release a CPU like this unless it knew there was still a market for it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-launches-a-budget-gaming-beast-ryzen-5-5500x3d-arrives-for-the-latin-american-market">Ryzen 5 5500X3D</a> is an excellent example of this being an "all-new" Ryzen CPU based on the Zen 3 architecture, but it is region-locked to Latin America. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-launches-four-new-ryzen-cpus-including-cutdown-zen-4-and-zen-3-models-most-only-available-in-global-markets">Ryzen 5 5600F and Ryzen 5 7400</a> are similar, both being locked to the Asian market.</p><p>Intel is also no stranger to this strategy; it recently released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intels-14nm-desktop-cpus-are-making-a-comeback-chipmaker-inexplicably-resurrects-comet-lake-from-five-years-ago-with-new-core-i5-110">Core i5-110</a>, based on its Comet Lake 14nm architecture, an architecture that debuted five years ago in chips such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-10900k-cpu-review">Core i9-10900K</a>.</p><p>The only caveat owners will need to be aware of is motherboard compatibility for the 3000G. The chip is so old that AMD's latest iteration of 500-series AM5 motherboards doesn't support it. Technically, these boards can help, but AMD has released so many AM4 CPUs over the past eight years that there likely isn't enough room in the firmware memory of 500-series motherboards to accommodate such old chips.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Apollo Computing stepped forward to reveal its “Proper next-gen Amiga” to the masses earlier this week. The German firm has unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://a6000.net/">Apollo A6000</a>, a comprehensive modern Amiga system featuring advanced technologies, including a “cutting-edge V4 AC68080” FPGA, which makes it the “most powerful Amiga 68k compatible ever created.”</p><p>Moreover, the Apollo A6000 retains the cutesy retro styling of the Amiga A600 (probably that machine’s best feature), enhanced by eye-popping tech specs and a built-in mechanical keyboard.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNGrgfX5bqc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Vintage Amigans may best remember Apollo for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-emulates-amiga-1200-uses-real-floppy-disks">Amiga A1200</a> trapdoor accelerators, and more recently for Vampire FPGA accelerator boards for a host of legacy Commodore machines.

With all those nice custom-made technologies coming together in the A6000, it is priced at over $1,000. In its home country, Apollo sold 40 First Edition Codename Unicorn devices for €960 each within hours of the announcement. Converted directly, that’s $1,128, but you could deduct 19% German VAT and add locally applicable U.S. sales tax to get a better idea of the final actual pricing.</p><p>The lucky buyers of this first production run of 40 units can look forward to delivery shortly. However, those of us who missed that first run should stay tuned to the links above for news of the next batch(es).

<![CDATA[ Microsoft Gaming Copilot hits Windows in public beta — in-game AI overlay goes live for PC players ]]>
<p>Microsoft began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/09/19/gaming-copilot-beta-coming-to-windows-pc/">rolling out its new Gaming Copilot assistant</a> to Windows users as part of a public beta on September 19, following a previous rollout to Xbox Insiders in August. The feature, located within the Xbox Game Bar overlay, provides players with real-time in-game support using AI-driven context from their screen and Xbox account.</p><p>Unlike past versions of Copilot integrated into Windows or Microsoft 365, Gaming Copilot is built with screen context and real-time game awareness. It reads from your Xbox account history, sees what you’re playing, and can analyze screen content on demand to answer in-game questions. Microsoft says it’s designed to help players find achievements, plan builds, and navigate quests without needing to alt-tab to wikis or YouTube.</p><p>On paper, Gaming Copilot resembles third-party tools like Overwolf, but it operates at the system level within the Game Bar overlay, which provides more reliable full-screen behavior and compatibility with DirectX titles. Microsoft has also confirmed that the assistant can be pinned as a widget and activated with push-to-talk voice controls, two features already present in this early beta.</p><p>The company has not disclosed whether any of the Copilot inference runs locally or if it’s entirely cloud-based. There is also no mention of NPU acceleration, which would matter for players using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-last-15-hours-on-our-battery-test-but-intel-systems-not-that-far-behind">Snapdragon X</a> laptops or hybrid-core CPUs with on-device AI blocks. This will be a key testing point, particularly as Microsoft has framed the Copilot experience as optimized for new handhelds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/microsofts-new-handheld-gaming-mode-exclusive-to-rog-xbox-ally-has-just-leaked-for-every-handheld-running-windows-11-all-you-need-is-the-25h2-update-and-a-few-registry-tweaks">ROG Ally X</a>.</p><p>Anti-cheat compatibility is another open question. Vendors like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye generally whitelist Game Bar itself, but Copilot is a more complex overlay, and Microsoft hasn’t clarified whether any specific protections are in place. With real-time screenshot analysis and persistent widgets, it’s not clear how Copilot will behave in titles with aggressive DRM or competitive match enforcement.</p><p>With the release of Gaming Copilot, Microsoft appears to be making a concerted effort to make Windows feel more like a native gaming platform. Just days before the Copilot rollout, the company updated the Xbox app to serve as a unified launcher that aggregates titles from Steam, Epic, GOG, and others. Together, these changes transform Windows from a passive host OS to an active participant in the gaming experience.</p><p>Gaming Copilot is now available for players aged 18 and older, in all regions except mainland China.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Asus TUF Gaming F16 review: Strong gaming performance offset by skimpy SSD, short battery life ]]>
<p>If you’re looking to enjoy some 1080p gaming without shelling out a lot of money, we had the chance to review the new Asus TUF Gaming F16 gaming laptop. It uses Nvidia’s entry-level RTX 5050 GPU with an added twist. While some laptops have opted for a higher-tier RTX 5060 with lower TDPs, the TUF Gaming F16 is packing a potent 115-watt RTX 5050 that helps to level the playing field for gaming.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 is an imposing laptop thanks to its 16-inch frame, and it manages to incorporate a generous assortment of ports, an RGB keyboard, a numberpad, and a 165 Hz IPS display. Given its as-tested MSRP of $1,199, the TUF Gaming F16 offers strong performance, but that comes with a couple of caveats.</p><h2 id="design-of-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Design of the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>One word can be used to describe the TUF Gaming F16's design: understated. While the TUF Gaming F16 is first and foremost a gaming machine, it features a clean exterior, finished in black and light grey. The aluminum lid is minimalistic, with just the letters "TUF" and the accompanying logo embossed in the top corner.</p><p>There are some interesting touches, including the rear exhaust panel with triangle- and rhombus-shaped cutouts. There's also a nifty four-leaf status LED at the top of the rear deck (behind the display) – it blinks to signify power status, drive access, etc.</p><div class="inlinegallery

For comparison, the RTX 5060 in the Nitro V 16S AI has a TGP of just 85 watts, while the 16 Aurora’s RTX 5060 has an 80-watt TGP. The advantage in available TGP plays highly in the TUF Gaming F16’s favor in gaming benchmarks, even though the RTX 5060 used in the two competing laptops is technically a more powerful chip.</p><p>Taking a look at <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> (Highest settings), the TUF Gaming F16 delivered 95 FPS at 1080p and 90 FPS at 1200p. Those numbers weren’t too far off the pace of the Nitro V 16S AI, which hit 98 FPS at 1080p and 91 FPS at 1200p. The 16 Aurora was one frame per second faster at 1080p.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The Nitro V 16S AI achieved 32 FPS at 1080p and 27 FPS at 1200p, which was actually just behind the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p><em>Far Cry 6</em> (Ultra settings) saw the TUF Gaming F16 push its way to the front of the pack, with 90 FPS at 1080p and 86 FPS at 1200p — the Nitro V 16S AI well behind, at 82 FPS and 79 FPS, respectively. The 16 Aurora pulled up the rear (not by much), with 81 FPS at 1080p.</p><p>It was another three-way race in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (Medium settings), with our review unit easily keeping up with the other two competitors. The TUF Gaming F16 and Nitro V 16S AI scored identically, with 68 FPS at 1080p and 64 FPS at 1200p.</p><p>Finally, the <em>Borderlands 3</em> benchmark (Badass settings), saw the TUF Gaming F16 hit 81 FPS at 1080p and 75 FPS at 1200p, compared to 82 FPS and 81 FPS, respectively, for the Nitro V 16S AI. The 16 Aurora was the leader at 1080p with 83 FPS.</p><p>The overall sentiment here is that despite being a lower-level SKU in the RTX 50 Series, Asus’ implementation of the RTX 5050 with a 115W TGP and a 2,092 MHz max boost clock allows it to remain competitive with the TGP-capped RTX 5060 competition.</p><p><em>Metro Exodus</em> remains our go-to benchmark for gaming laptop stress testing. Our review unit averaged 65.62 FPS at 1080p across 15 loops using the RTX benchmark preset. The CPU performance cores averaged 3.0 GHz, and the efficiency cores averaged 2.53 GHz. The RTX 5060 GPU also ran at 2.53 GHz.</p><h2 id="productivity-performance-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Productivity Performance on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Our review unit has a Core i7-14650HX "Raptor Lake" processor, which has 8 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. That processor is paired with just 16GB of DDR5-5600 memory, instead of the 32GB found on the competing laptops (while the Aurora was far more expensive as tested, the Acer was $100 more). SSD storage is also a bit on the stingy side at 512GB, which doesn’t leave a lot of space for games after you take into account the standard Windows 11 Home install.</p><p>The TUF Gaming F16 started strong in the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, achieving a single-core score of 2,710 and a multi-core score of 15,013. That performance put it slightly ahead of the Acer (Ryzen 7 260) and Alienware (Core i7-240H) contenders in single-core, with a healthier margin of victory for multi-core.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Asus is using a 512GB Micron 2500 Series PCIe 4.0 SSD, rated for 6,600 MBps sequential reads and 3,650 MBps sequential writes. In our test, the SSD only managed 775.5 MBps compared to 1,170.12 MB/s for the 16 Aurora. The Nitro V 16S AI left our review unit in the dust, more than doubling its results (1,838.88 MBps). Going with a 512GB SSD was already painful, but the lagging performance just adds insult to injury. In the real world, I noticed some sluggishness when installing games onto the SSD.</p><p>Our Handbrake benchmark involves transcoding a 4K video file to 1080p. The TUF Gaming F16 completed the task in 3 minutes and 33 seconds, easily dispatching the other two systems. The Nitro V 16S AI took nearly a minute longer to complete the transcode (4 minutes and 32 seconds).</p><h2 id="display-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Display on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Like many mainstream gaming laptops, Asus has adopted a 16:10 aspect ratio for the TUF Gaming F16’s display, meaning that you get a 1920 x 1200 resolution. An IPS panel is employed here, accompanied by a relatively brisk 165 Hz refresh rate. An anti-reflective layer is used on the display.</p><p>Compared to the Nitro V 16S AI and 16 Aurora, the TUF Gaming F16 comes up short in overall panel brightness — at least on paper. We measured 298.4 nits compared to 312.2 for the 16 Aurora and 391.8 nits for the Nitro V 16S AI. However, in the real world, I never felt wanting for
additional brightnessin an indoor setting. The screen did wash out a little when using the laptop outside on a partly cloudy day, but it was still usable without straining with the brightness maxed out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

In practice, there was little to complain about with respect to how colors were represented on the display. The anti-reflective coating might blunt colors just a tad compared to a glossy finish, but everything that I threw at the TUF Gaming F16 looked great. I spent a few hours toiling around in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and came away impressed with how gorgeous the varying environments were.</p><p>I also watched a few episodes of my new favorite TV show, <em>The Pitt</em>, on the display. Unlike some previous medical dramas, which lean heavily on unrealistic darkened set design to create a certain mood, <em>The Pitt</em> is bathed in the stark bright lights of a typical hospital. There's nowhere to hide under these illuminating conditions. From the various colors of the scrubs worn by nurses, interns, and doctors, to their lifelike gushes of blood (and other bodily fluids) that shoot across the screen, I felt fully immersed in the frantic emergency room environment.</p><h2 id="keyboard-and-touchpad-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Keyboard and Touchpad on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>The TUF Gaming F16 uses a full-size keyboard plus a dedicated numberpad. The keys have 1.7 mm of travel and are adequately spaced to occupy as much of the width afforded by the 16-inch frame as possible. While the majority of the keys feature black keycaps, the WASD keys are clear, which allows more of the RGB coloring to shine through when enabled.</p><p>Speaking of RGB, the TUF Gaming F16 uses a single-zone RGB setup (compared to four zones for the Acer) that can be configured with the Armory Crate app. You can also quickly change Aura Effects using the Fn + F4 key combination.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The surface also provides a satisfying click.</p><h2 id="audio-on-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Audio on the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>The TUF Gaming F16 only comes with two speakers, but they are punching well above their weight when it comes to performance. The speakers are loud, clear, and equally adept at producing remarkable sound in games, movies, TV shows, and music.</p><p>Playing <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, I could hear the distinct sounds of boots hitting metal ladders as I climbed them, the audible grunts pulling myself up to a platform, the “glug glug” of pouring a bottle of wine, and the crack of Indy’s iconic whip. Of course, this was with the volume raised to about 30% to overpower the laptop’s twin cooling fans.</p><p>I also took the time to slink into the melodic tranquility of “Mujahedin and Opium,” a John Barry track from the James Bond film, <em>The Living Daylights</em>. The song is a perfect mix of percussion, strings, and soaring brass that gives it a majestic quality (and is probably one of my favorite pieces in the lengthy catalog of James Bond soundtracks). I felt that the TUF Gaming F16 captured the raw essence of the piece, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that I might have played the song on repeat a dozen times or so.</p><h2 id="upgradeability-of-the-asus-tuf-gaming-f16-2">Upgradeability of the Asus TUF Gaming F16</h2><p>Eleven Phillips head screws affix the bottom panel to the TUF Gaming F16’s main chassis.

However, the results weren’t as promising as I would have hoped. While the overall resolution seemed slightly better than the 720p webcams I’ve recently encountered, the colors were somewhat washed out and not as well saturated. My skin typically appears brown in webcams, but it looks a bit greyer on the TUF Gaming F16.</p><p>Overall, the webcam was just adequate, and I wouldn’t chalk it up as being anywhere near the top of its class.

To add insult to injury, storage performance lagged well behind the competition. Most laptops in this price range give you double the RAM and double the storage space. While you could upgrade this system to fix these problems, that would be easier to swallow at a $999 price point.</p><p>Battery life was also just average, with the TUF Gaming F16 lasting just under 7 hours compared to over 10 hours for the Acer Nitro V 16S AI.</p><p>In my opinion, the Nitro V 16S AI is the better overall laptop, boasting far superior battery life, comparable gaming performance, twice the storage space, and twice the RAM. It’ll cost you $100 more, but it’s well worth the extra coin.</p>

<![CDATA[ Borderlands 4 props come to 3D printing fans — Ripper mask, replica weapons, and cosplay components come in a new collection from Prusa Research ]]>
<p>On the day <em>Borderlands 4</em> hit shelves, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prusa3d.com/article/borderlands-4-and-prusa-research-partner-for-free-launch-day-3d-printable-cosplay-models_243355/">Prusa</a> and developer Gearbox Software published a library of official models on Printables.com that has seen over 20,000 downloads in the first week. The collection includes the franchise’s iconic Psycho mask, a variety of replica weapons, and detailed cosplay components — all verified and test-printed on Prusa 3D printers.</p><p>It’s not unusual to find creators on YouTube showing off fan art and cosplay pieces inspired by video games and movies. However, lately, the studios have been getting directly involved in the process. Adam Savage’s <em>Tested</em> worked with Bethesda to first create, then release, a printable <em>Frontier </em>model from <em>Starfield</em>. Joel Telling, AKA the 3D Printing Nerd, collaborated with Paramount on a massive Optimus Primal model to promote <em>Transformers: Rise of the Beasts</em>. That model, along with an Optimus Primal flexi, was released for free on Printables and was downloaded thousands of times by fans. These projects gave makers official 3D files, tutorials, and build videos that blurred the line between studio content and maker culture.</p><p>Now, Prusa Research is stepping into that role directly. The Czech 3D-printer company is forging partnerships with both entertainment studios and global brands to provide makers with officially licensed 3D files that are both fun and practical.</p><p>“I love when the line between digital and physical blurs,” said Josef Průša, founder and CEO of Prusa Research. “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/is-borderlands-4-the-new-crysis-official-gpu-setting-recommendations-peg-4k-performance-with-the-rtx-5090-at-60-fps-with-dlss-and-frame-generation-enabled"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches, and on the same day you can already have a Ripper mask sitting on your desk. That’s just awesome. Usually, props like this take weeks of work to design from scratch. Now it’s literally: click, print, and a piece of Borderlands is in your hands.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Earlier this year, Prusa added models from <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> by CD Projekt RED, providing cosplayers with accurate files for props and costume parts. The site also hosts licensed files from Czech titles such as <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and Bohemia Interactive’s <em>Arma</em> and <em>DayZ</em>.</p><p>Prusa isn’t stopping with games. The company has also courted major tech brands, encouraging them to release 3D-printable accessories, mods, and replacement parts directly to the Printables maker community. Collaborations have included custom PC cases from Corsair, Noctua fan ducts, and combs to fit Phillips electric razors.</p><p>These projects are part of a broader strategy by Prusa to position 3D printing as a bridge between brands and their customers – at least the ones with 3D printers. By offering free, studio-approved files, companies can engage players and consumers in a way that feels both collectible and creative. Cosplayers gain reliable, detailed models, while hobbyists enjoy high-quality parts without the guesswork of reverse-engineering from screenshots.</p><p>With Printables.com serving as a central hub, official models don’t need to be scattered across fan forums or buried in unverified repositories. Though Printables is part of the Prusa Research family, their website and slicers are open to makers with any brand of 3D printer.</p><p>For Prusa, this is just the beginning. The company says it plans to expand its portfolio of partnerships and may even host design competitions tied to popular brands. With the arrival of <em>Borderlands 4</em> files, it’s easy to imagine a future where launch-day exclusives aren’t just posters or skins, but STL or 3MF files that fans can bring to life on their printers.</p><p>As digital content increasingly overlaps with physical fandom, Prusa’s collaborations suggest that branded 3D printing may become as common as DLC or limited-edition merch, except this time, you get to manufacture it yourself at home.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Ukraine has finished testing a new kamikaze strike drone design, which it says can overcome the hurdles presented by Russian electronic warfare (EW). The new Brave1 drones offer extended range, beyond 50km (31 miles), according to the Ukrainian Defense Innovations organization. Moreover, the designers assert that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brave1ukraine_kamikaze-strike-drones-with-a-range-of-40-activity-7373286576396591105--1g_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAHyV20B4QsZQrWqreoc3vrbdvurAHmEscY" target="_blank">the new drones will deliver</a> "a new level of enemy destruction far behind the front lines."</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It is then hoped to “accelerate the mass deployment of strike drones on the battlefield.” This should be more easily achieved if it is indeed true that the Brave1 kamikaze drones are “affordable to manufacture and ready for scaling.”</p><p>Details of the key electronic warfare-resistant technology being used by the new Brave1 drones are scarce.

<p>A PC repair professional was sent in a system to fix that had some unusual, and possibly hazardous, modifications. Redditor and repair shop owner, elishalewisusaf, didn’t shy away from branding the stricken PC a “monstrosity.” Indeed, the PSU shroud looks like it was ripped open by a xenomorph, breaking through the perforated steel venting to protect its hive.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"
><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1njkgpg/i_own_a_tech_repair_business_and_this_monstrosity">I own a tech repair business - and this monstrosity came in.

The PSU shroud already featured a modestly sized cutout for cable routing, just below the xenomorph breach zone. Indeed, elishalewisusaf is also “baffled” by what they saw when this PC arrived in the repair shop.</p><p>The assembled social media-based PC building experts generally opine that the twisted metal surgery this PC has undergone, presumably by the owner, is user error, to put it politely. However, some are charitable enough to suggest the 8-pin cable from PSU to GPU may have been too short to take a more scenic route. That would mean it was an unusually short cable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

So, we don’t know if the twisted metal mess between the PSU zone and the rest of the PC actually caused a functional problem. It would not be surprising if some of the cabling we can’t see is damaged or shorting, due to metal shards or dust.</p><h2 id="once-a-proud-pc-system-2">Once a proud PC system</h2><p>Also in the image, we can see that this ailing PC once proudly brandished the Digital Storm marque. That firm claims to build PCs with “expert craftsmanship,” and is committed to “crafting the world’s most advanced gaming PCs.” It also offers lifetime support - so the PSU shroud-mangler should have reached for the phone before reaching for the bolt cutters, or whatever inappropriate tool did this damage.</p><p>We’d guess that the GPU pictured is an Asus Dual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">GeForce RTX 3060</a>, possibly an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-asus-dual">RTX 4060</a>. That means, if this PC originally shipped with the GPU, it was put together around four or fewer years ago. Dust buildup looks like a few years' worth, too.</p><p>Some Redditors can’t help but comment on the 256GB SATA drive we see mounted on the PSU shroud area. We’d like to think this is an old drive brought along from a prior PC, not the primary, as it lacks capacity and performance if the PC is meant for gaming duties in 2025.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Microsoft hikes Xbox Series X price, again, to $649 — second price increase of 2025 comes as shifting tariffs continue to plague tech prices ]]>
<p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">has announced</a> a new price increase for its Xbox Series X and S consoles coming on October 3, a scant five months after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/xbox/microsoft-hikes-prices-of-xbox-consoles-controllers-headsets-and-games-worldwide-cites-market-conditions-and-price-of-development">previous hike in May</a>. The already-pricey Xbox Series X now commands $649.99, the Series S goes for $399.99 (with 512 GB of storage), and the capacious Series X 2 TB Galaxy Black Special Edition has a price tag as long as its name, at $799.99.</p><p>However, this time around, things are a little different. The sting is pointed only at U.S. customers, and mercifully covers only the consoles. This is in contrast to the May increase, when Microsoft raised prices on its console wares across the board, including accessories and games, and applied them worldwide.</p><div ><table><caption>Revised Xbox Series U.S. pricing</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th

While that might be a decent justification in of itself, some would argue that it's a lack of forethought and/or poor optics to have price increases twice in the same year for similar reasons.</p><p>Microsoft might be simply following the market on the heels of Sony, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/sony-hikes-ps5-prices-by-usd50-starting-tomorrow-sony-adds-up-to-10-percent-to-the-price-of-every-model-from-august-21">raised prices</a> for its PlayStation 5 lineup by $50 roughly a month ago. As it stands, the standard PlayStation 5 currently sits at $549.99, undercutting the Xbox Series X by a solid $100. That's quite the bitter pill for prospective Halo gamers to swallow, and just like Microsoft's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-follows-nvidias-lead-surpasses-usd4-trillion-market-capitalization-on-soaring-demand-for-cloud-services-multi-front-ai-endeavors">Q4 revenue</a>, it's more than a little rich in light of PlayStation having a lion's share of the market.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, the time is ripe for affordable PCs, and some napkin math puts a machine equal or better to the Xbox Series X at around the $600 mark, give or take, as pricing winds allow. Given how hard Microsoft is pushing its cross-platform Xbox Game Pass, it's become harder still to justify the price of a Series X.</p><p>Back in August, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">Sony reported</a> that it had sold 80.3 million PlayStation 5 consoles. There are no sales figures for the Xbox Series consoles, but if Take-Two's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e8841ad4-15c4-4572-b4c4-0df5548df6ba">financial report</a> from May is to be believed, a total of around 107 million ninth-generation consoles have been sold. Simple math would put the Xbox Series offerings at over 27 million.</p><p>Considering the elapsed time since then and assuming a very generous 30 million, that works out to 62.6% versus 37.3% for Sony. Good thing Microsoft's services are raking in cash hand over fist.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ OpenAI is reportedly poaching Apple talent to build its first consumer hardware device — could potentially be a smart speaker ]]>
<p>OpenAI has signed a manufacturing agreement with Luxshare to build its first consumer hardware product, according to a new report from<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-raids-apple-hardware-talent-manufacturing-partners"><em>The Information</em></a>. The device — described by suppliers as something that resembles a screenless smart speaker (in other words, an Alexa-adjacent device) — is part of a broader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-confirms-he-is-working-on-an-openai-hardware-design-project">push into hardware</a> that also includes exploratory work on glasses, a wearable pin, and a digital voice recorder. Sources familiar with the roadmap say OpenAI is targeting a late 2026 or early 2027 launch window.</p><p>Luxshare isn't the only Apple supplier involved. Goertek, which builds AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watch components, has been approached to provide speaker modules for OpenAI's first product. The company is also said to be engaging with other Chinese supply chain partners Apple has spent years cultivating, including those in tooling and precision audio.</p><p>According to <em>The Register</em>, the hardware project is being led by Tang Tan, who left Apple in 2023 after a 25-year tenure that included design oversight of various flagship products. Tan now serves as OpenAI's chief hardware officer and reports directly to CEO Sam Altman. In May, OpenAI acquired io Products — the hardware design studio Tan co-founded with Jony Ive — in a $6.5 billion deal backed by SoftBank. Court documents from an ongoing trademark dispute describe OpenAI's goal as building a family of AI-native products under the io brand.</p><p>Since the io acquisition, OpenAI has stepped up recruiting across Apple's product and operations teams. At least 25 former Apple employees are understood to have joined the effort in 2025 alone, with backgrounds in human interface design, audio, wearables, and manufacturing scale-up. Among them are senior figures like Cyrus Daniel Irani, a longtime Siri interface designer, and Matt Theobald, who spent 17 years on Apple's manufacturing design team. Others include engineers from Apple's camera and Watch divisions. Most hires have joined Tan's org inside OpenAI, though some remain associated with LoveFrom, Ive's separate design firm.</p><p>The poaching of talent could complicate the company's relationship with Apple, which, since 2024, has integrated OpenAI's models into Siri and iOS. That partnership now runs parallel to a hardware effort built by Apple's own former talent and vendors.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ How often should you expect to replace your headset, keyboard, or mouse — buying tips for picking longer-lasting gear ]]>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, my colleague Matt Safford showed up to our morning meeting wearing half a headset. "Guess what," he announced. "My headset — the one that I <em>only </em>use for these meetings — just snapped in half. While I was wearing it."</p><p>I asked if he'd been putting it on, or fiddling with the adjustments, and he confirmed that he wasn't touching it — it was on his head and it suddenly felt loose, and when he reached up to see what was going on, he discovered it was in two pieces. RIP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/razer-barracuda-pro"><u>Razer Barracuda Pro</u></a> — the included rigid carrying case isn't quite as much of a benefit if the headset is so fragile it's going to snap in half while it's being used exactly as intended.</p><p>This isn't the first time one of us has shown up to the morning meeting in need of a new peripheral, whether it's a headset, keyboard, mouse, or, I don't know... a chair or a desk. And peripherals, especially gaming peripherals, aren't meant to last forever — they wear out (even if you're not a gamer who's prone to fits of rage), physically, and they become dated, technologically. At the rate gaming companies update their lineups, it seems like you should be shopping for new accessories every 2 - 3 years. Of course, gaming companies want to sell you stuff, so that's not a great way to estimate the expected lifespan of your gear.</p><p>But you might be wondering just how long your peripherals <em>should </em>last, assuming you're not a competitive eSports athlete or a gaming peripherals editor.</p><h2 id="headsets-2">Headsets</h2><p>Matt's Razer Barracuda lasted about 2.5 years, which is definitely shorter than you should expect a gaming headset to last (and you shouldn't expect any gaming headset to snap at the hinge while you're just... wearing it). But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/best-gaming-headsets"><u>best gaming headsets</u></a> won't necessarily last forever, depending on a few factors.</p><p>Wireless headsets tend to lose their steam faster because the battery degrades — but you should still be able to get a solid 3 - 4 years out of a wireless headset, if not longer. Wired headsets can last significantly longer if they're well-built, but most gaming headsets are... not that well-built. Still, a decent wired headset should get you a solid 5 - 6 years of use — longer if it has replaceable parts.</p><p>Here's what you should look for if you're looking for a headset that won't snap in half:</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The only gripe? The earpads, which are leatherette-covered memory foam, wear out fairly quickly and are difficult to replace — mostly because Corsair didn't sell them for a long time (though I believe they do, now). Earpads tend to wear out after 1 - 2 years of regular use (or sooner, depending on what they're made of and whether you sweat), so you should look for a gaming headset with replaceable earpads. Some gaming headsets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/logitech-g-pro-x-2-lightspeed-review"><u>Logitech's G Pro X 2 Lightspeed</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-headsets/asus-rog-delta-ii-review"><u>Asus' ROG Delta II</u></a>, even come with alternate / replacement earpads in the box.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Your mouse gets a lot more wear than your keyboard does, because it has significantly fewer buttons and it's always moving. (Also, if you are the type of gamer who gets heated, your mouse is probably the easiest thing to slam down on your desk or throw across the room.) Mouse switches and keyboard switches have similar click ratings, but you'll reach that number a lot quicker when you only have two buttons to choose from instead of 88 or 104 (or however many keys there are on your keyboard). That said, while updating your mouse every 2 - 3 years isn't crazy, you should still be able to stretch a gaming mouse's lifespan to 3 - 4 years as long as you're not excessively slamming or squeezing it.</p><p>But you still want your gaming mouse to last the full 2 - 3 years, so here's what to look for:</p><p><strong>Solid build: </strong>This might seem like a no-brainer, but it's still worth mentioning — if you want your mouse to last, it needs to be well-built and sturdy-feeling right out of the box.

<![CDATA[ GPU sales skyrocketed 27% last quarter — tariff jitters sparked an odd gaming hardware spending surge in Q2 '25 ]]>
<p>The middle of the year is usually a sleepy season for PC hardware sales, and so summer quarter shipments tend to sag a bit as people hold off until holiday deals. Of course, 2025 has been anything but typical. Instead of the usual slowdown, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q225-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-increased-27-0-from-last-quarter/">the latest numbers</a> from Jon Peddie Research (JPR) show a surprising surge in CPU and GPU shipments. The culprit? Fear of tariffs, according to the analyst.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/usd320-camera-lens-buyers-hit-with-usd2-000-delivery-fee-in-tariffs-fight-some-sellers-implement-exorbitant-shipping-costs-to-dissuade-us-customers">new U.S. import tariffs</a> hanging over tech imports, PC makers and consumers alike went into buy-ahead mode. The result was a markedly unseasonal rush on gaming hardware that pulled demand forward, creating what could be called a "panic‑build quarter" in the client PC industry.</p><p>The numbers tell the story, as CPU shipments were up about 8% quarter‑over‑quarter and 13% year‑over‑year. Desktop CPUs increased their share versus laptops by 9% to grab 33% of the market share, a healthy bump in a segment that's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/best-gaming-laptops">overshadowed by laptops</a> in recent years.</p><p>Total GPU shipments jumped 8.4% from last quarter, up to 74.7 million units. Nvidia scooped up more share at the expense of AMD and Intel, likely due in part to the superior availability of its GPUs. However, Intel still sells more GPUs than either of the other two combined, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus">its dominance</a> in the laptop CPU market.</p><p>The standout statistic was discrete desktop graphics cards, or add-in boards (AIBs), up a wild 27% quarter‑to‑quarter and 22% year‑over‑year, due in part to impressive new hardware from all three vendors. Nvidia's grip tightened further, rising to 94% of the AIB market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-dominates-gpu-shipments-with-94-percent-share-shipment-surge-likely-caused-by-customers-getting-ahead-of-tariffs">as we previously reported</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Usually, shipments drift lower before rebounding at year's end, but this time, tariffs flipped the script. Retailers and distributors didn't want to get caught flat-footed if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-announces-100-percent-semiconductor-tariffs-theres-no-charge-for-chips-built-in-the-u-s">regulations suddenly raised costs</a>, and enthusiasts picked up on the same cues. Nobody wanted to be the one paying 15–25% more for a graphics card a few months later, so they bought early, clearing stock and pushing prices higher at the high end.</p><p>JPR calls this "buying ahead of tariffs," and it comes with a warning: demand that gets pulled forward can leave a hole later. Q3 and Q4 might look weaker because so many buyers have already opened their wallets.</p><p>This wasn't just about economics, though; it was also about timing. Nvidia's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5060-is-up-to-25-percent-faster-than-rtx-4060-with-frame-generation-in-new-gpu-preview">entry- and mid-range</a> Blackwell cards, as well as AMD's new RDNA 4 GPUs, were filling shelves right as the tariff panic set in. Gamers who might have otherwise waited for the latest hardware to mature instead rushed to lock down fresh GPUs while they could.</p><p>Interestingly, Dr. Peddie notes that the midrange stayed relatively affordable as vendors leaned on it to keep shipments moving. Still, flagship GPUs saw rising prices and severe shortages, reflecting what we've seen with the GeForce RTX 5090, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-confirms-its-recently-delisted-rtx-50-series-founders-edition-cards-are-not-discontinued-limited-edition-products-were-removed-because-they-were-out-of-stock">which is unobtanium</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/usd3-700-rtx-5090-gpus-have-found-new-homes-after-sitting-on-us-retailers-shelves">at least, at MSRP</a>). The psychology is easy to trace: better to grab a new graphics card today than risk paying even more tomorrow.</p><p>Trump's tariffs didn't just bend economic charts; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/newegg-blames-tariffs-for-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-price-hikes">bent gamer behavior</a>.

<![CDATA[ Building in the Thermaltake Tower 250 made me furious about one design flaw that could be easily solved — cramped cable cut-outs and inaccessible I/O ]]>
<p>As I am sure many readers can relate, I heard the hallowed, somewhat daunting words that friends and loved ones say to the resident PC geek or tech enthusiast in their lives —
"Can you make me a PC?"</p><p>Of course, I've done it dozens of times, but this was the first time that my wife, who regularly plays (or attempts to run) AAA games on a basic RTX 3050 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/best-gaming-laptops">gaming laptop</a>, wanted something higher-end. I would figure out the components, and she could pick out a case, specifying other aesthetic frills she would like. It couldn't be a big, black, boring box, and it had to be an interesting color. My wife eventually settled on the Thermaltake Tower 250 in the eye-catching "Hydrangea Blue" colorway. The PC case is an evolution of the original Tower 100, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermaltake-the-tower-100-review/2">we reviewed in 2019</a>.</p><p>Things began to come together, and being a resourceful sort, we managed to corral all of the components to build a (slightly larger than usual) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases">ITX-based</a> system.</p><p>This isn't a super-high-end build, sporting an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-5-9600x-cpu-review">AMD Ryzen 5 9600X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review">RTX 4080 Founders Edition GPU</a>, which I had intended to use in a different build. With that, alongside a 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD from Sabrent and 32GB of Klevv RAM, it is quite a performant system, which should easily run just about every modern AAA title without issue at 1440p.</p><p>Once the case arrived and we started the build process, I noticed something unusual. The Thermaltake Tower 250 rotates the motherboard 90 degrees, compared to a standard configuration. This allows for a vertically-placed GPU, a motherboard placed in the center, and then support for an all-in-one cooler's radiator on the right. This isn't an issue in itself, but it does cause the motherboard's I/O to be pointing to the top of the case, in addition to any GPU display cables.</p><h2 id="where-for-art-thou-i-o-2">Where for art thou, I/O</h2><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6ck3dBnEzh7vzMmLtcCRU" name="Thermaltake Tower 250 IO" alt="Tower 250 IO" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6ck3dBnEzh7vzMmLtcCRU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The top of the Thermaltake Tower 250 is quite crowded; there are two preinstalled exhaust fans, in addition to the front I/O panel of the case. There's also a cut-out for cables, in addition to around an inch of clearance next to the fan shroud for anything coming from the motherboard IO, which feeds into a hole for the plastic shroud that covers it, leading out of the case.</p><p>So, if you want to plug anything into your motherboard, you'll have to navigate a frustrating labyrinth of cut-outs every single time. Many people will set and forget their rear I/O, ports, and with two USB-A and a Type-C port at the front, many just won't need it. Since this PC uses Wi-Fi, routing the antenna through was very simple, and I added a handful of USB-C cables to be routed to the desk to have a couple of chargers, in case she needs to plug things in.</p><p>What I didn't anticipate was the sheer number of random cables my wife would want to plug into her system at any given time. With the front I/O already populated, plugging in USB devices became more difficult than it really should be. When factoring in the heft of a DisplayPort cable in addition to everything else, things got pretty crowded.</p><p>So, the process of taking the top of the case off and wrangling around inside to plug in devices continued. This slight inconvenience turned into annoyance, and I answered the repeated calls of "Can you plug this in please?" repeatedly for a whole week, until I buckled and bought a generic USB hub from Amazon.</p><p>You shouldn't really have to do that for the sake of convenience, especially when a motherboard has enough IO for everything. But now that the saga is over, it also highlights another design issue for the Thermaltake Tower 250.</p><h2 id="building-cleanly-still-results-in-visible-cable-mess-2">Building cleanly still results in visible cable mess</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

The case has consistent and simple channels for almost everything, including support for a full-sized PSU. Cable channelling for the GPU is well-thought-out, meaning we hid the majority of a white 12V2x6 cable into a corner, which cannot be seen from most angles. With everything put together, it looked and ran well, until I realized that the I/O pointing out at the top can become a bit of an eyesore.</p><p>With several cables running out at the top, the effort put in elsewhere to hide cables so efficiently was seemingly for naught. Above the I/O, there's an inch or two of clearance where cables can be routed. The problem is that with the Hydrangea Blue colorway of the case, the internal metal sheets are white, so if you have any black cables, they stick out like a sore thumb. This is admittedly minor compared to my other grievance, but it also has a fairly simple solution.</p><p>If Thermaltake built a detachable shroud for this part of the Tower 250, which puts some effort into hiding the cabling, it would also allow for a larger cable routing channel through the rear, making it simpler to actually make use of the motherboard I/O, or offer a wider cut-out, which makes accessing the rear IO much more accessible. Adding more steps between allowing a user to make use of the features of the components within the system is a black mark on an otherwise well-designed and good-looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-pc-cases,4183.html">PC case</a>.</p>

After building in the Thermaltake Tower 250, I found that the ITX PC case has one issue that drove me mad: the Motherboard I/O is difficult to access.

<![CDATA[ Asus gives us the PCIe finger — teases new concept that boosts motherboard GPU slot power to 250W ]]>
<p>Since PCIe's inception in the early 2000s, the high-speed connectivity standard has been limited to 75 watts of peak power from the physical slot. This is enough to power some entry-level graphics cards from the physical slot alone, but most graphics cards require auxiliary power to get enough juice. However, Asus wants to change that — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/884/319.htm">IT Home</a> reports that the GPU maker has teased a new concept design allowing the PCIe slot to deliver a whopping 250 watts of power output through modifications to the PCIe front finger.</p><p>The concept reportedly takes advantage of the unused part of the front PCIe finger to triple power output. The five 12V lines attached to the PCIe finger are "merged", with each line featuring enhanced width and thickness as well as more conductive materials to boost the slot's current-carrying capacity.</p><p>Top-down images of Asus' modifications show the changes; the five 12V pins at the front are significantly larger, to the point where they are visible to the naked eye. This is in contrast to a regular PCIe slot, where the pins are so small that they are virtually impossible to spot. To feed the modified PCIe slot, most of the additional power is allegedly fed by an extra 8-pin PCIe connector on the motherboard.</p><p>Asus's PCIe concept could finally make cableless graphics cards more mainstream, assuming adoption is high. PCIe's 75-watt limit has left all but the most power-efficient entry-level graphics cards as the only mainstream GPUs that can do away with auxiliary power cables.</p><p>Technically, Asus already has an internal proprietary GPU power connector for its cableless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/asus-reveals-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5070-ti-gpus-with-a-detachable-1000w-power-connector">BTF</a> products (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/asus-gpu-power-connector-delivers-1-000w-for-cableless-builds-gc-hpwr-has-a-retractable-design">GC-HPWR</a>). But Asus is likely building its aforementioned PCIe modification as a cheaper method to create cableless GPUs, particularly for the mainstream market. Modifying the PCIe slot on a motherboard or graphics card is cheaper than installing an extra internal finger for internal power delivery.</p><p>250 watts is not a lot of power in an era where most high-performance GPUs consume more than 350 watts. But 250 watts would be more than sufficient for all entry-level and lower-mid-range graphics cards. For example, AMD's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9060-xt-16gb-review">Radeon RX 9060 XT</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review"> RX 9070</a> consume just 160 and 220 watts, respectively, making them prime candidates for Asus' PCIe modification.</p><p>Again, though, Asus' concept is just that, a concept. There's no knowing how widely adopted Asus' design will be if it ever gets finalized. Asus' concept is also a modification of the PCIe standard, which could make adoption even harder. Even if it is adopted, board makers and AIB makers would need to build new graphics cards and motherboard models specifically designed to take advantage of Asus' concept, which would increase costs and manufacturing complexity.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Back in July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-n1x-soc-leaks-with-the-same-number-of-cuda-cores-as-an-rtx-5070-n1x-specs-align-with-the-gb10-superchip">we saw a Geekbench score</a> surface for the N1X, which allegedly confirmed these specs, giving credence to the fact that GB10 and N1 are intrinsically tied. Of course, just because two products are closely linked to each other doesn't mean they're the same, but all signs pointed toward identical chips being used across the board.</p><p>That notion has just been legitimized by Jensen Huang, who said the following in a webcast last night, "We also have a new ARM product that's called N1. And that product is - that processor is going to go into the DGX Spark and many other versions of products like that. And so we're super excited about the ARM road map, and this doesn't affect any of that."</p><p>According to Nvidia's CEO, the silicon powering the GB10 — which itself is what powers DGX Spark — is identical to the N1/N1X SoC. Especially the part about "many other versions" confirms that N1 could simply be a slightly lower-binned version of the full-fat GB10. After all, the latter is meant for client devices like laptops and desktops, whereas the GB10 targets professionals. The distinction matters because N1 represents Nvidia's first serious attempt at taking their in-house CPU cores mainstream (following Tegra).</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Nvidia's long-rumoed N1 SoC, featuring ARM-based CPU cores from MediaTek and Blackwell-based GPU cores, has now been confirmed as the same chip as the GB10 Superchip. They both share similar, if not identical, specs and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has just said that DGX Spark (which has the GB10) is powered by N1.

<![CDATA[ AMD silently launches RX 7700 non-XT with 16 GB VRAM — New RDNA 3 GPU uses nerfed Navi 32 die, offers reduced performance and increased power draw ]]>
<p>If you thought RDNA 3 was done, think again, because AMD has just refreshed the lineup with a brand new SKU — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7700-xt.html" target="_blank">the RX 7700 non-XT</a>. Listed silently on its website without any announcement, the RX 7700 comes with 16 GB of GDDR6 memory saturated across a 256-bit bus, compared to the 7700 XT's relatively meager 12 GB (across 192-bit). AMD has used 19.5 Gbps chips, so, combined with the aforementioned specs, that puts the memory bandwidth on par with the 7800 XT, at 624 GB/s.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The 7700 XT uses the same Navi 32 but has 3,456 Stream Processors and 54 CUs; it also has more ROPs and TMUs (see table at the end), and 48 MB Infinity Cache compared to just 40 MB on the RX 7700. Moreover, there are 80 AI accelerators on the RX 7700, which isn't impressive on its own, but when you combine that with the 16 GB memory pool, this could become a sleeper option for local AI applications.</p><p>In terms of performance, AMD lists FPS numbers for a bunch of different games, showing a ~20% decrease in gaming compared to the 7700 XT (when taking into account games that overlap). Not only that, but the RX 7700 seems to be less efficient too, eating up 263W of power (versus 245W on the 7700 XT) despite the reduced performance. That leaves local AI inference the only real selling point for this SKU, if it's priced right to begin with. There are dual 8-pin connectors on board, and AMD recommends a 700W power supply for the RX 7700.</p><div ><table><caption>RDNA 3 70-class gaming performance</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Game</p></th><th

<![CDATA[ [Updated] Intel says it remains committed to its Arc graphics project — 'Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings' ]]>
<p><strong>09/19/2025 update</strong>: <em>After publication, an Intel representative reached out with the following statement regarding GPU development: "While we’re not sharing specific roadmaps at this time, everything we discussed aligns with and complements Intel’s existing strategy. This collaboration with NVIDIA enables us to deliver additional custom solutions that accelerate AI workloads and broaden our reach across high-performance computing segments in client and data center.</em></p><p><em>We remain committed to our GPU roadmap. We’ll be collaborating with NVIDIA to serve specific market segments, but we’re also continuing to execute on our own path."</em></p><p><em>The original article follows below.</em></p><p>All talk in town right now is all about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">Intel-Nvidia partnership</a>, and a question on many minds is whether that means Intel might be scrapping its plans for upcoming Arc graphics cards or iGPUs. The company is attempting to assuage those fears, as one of its spokespeople told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2913872/intel-nvidia-deal-doesnt-change-its-roadmap.html" target="_blank">PCWorld</a>, “We’re not discussing specific roadmaps at this time, but the collaboration is complementary to Intel’s roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings."</p><p>Intel also reiterated that its collaboration with Nvidia is "complementary" to the company's extant roadmap. Both those statements seem clear at face value, but some might find it a little hard to believe, given everything that's happened with Intel in the past year, namely but not only the major cuts to its workforce and a refocusing on profitability. The wording of the statement is also curious, as the company stating it will still have GPUs doesn't clarify what type they will be, or who will design them.</p><p>Last December, Intel's ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger left abruptly. Shortly after, former CEO of Products Michelle Holthaus stated that Intel remained committed to Arc. In March, Intel named Lip-Bu Tan as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-appoints-lip-bu-tan-as-permanent-ceo">new CEO</a>, who issued more staff cuts and reportedly issued an order that any of Intel's new products have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-draws-a-line-in-the-sand-to-boost-gross-margins-new-products-must-deliver-50-percent-to-get-the-green-light">50% gross margin</a>. Additionally, Holthaus was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-ousts-ceo-of-products-as-part-of-the-latest-executive-shake-up-ending-30-year-career-company-also-establishes-new-custom-chip-design-unit">ousted recently</a>, after a mere 10 months in charge of Products. The company offered no updates to its Arc roadmap in the meantime.</p><p>All those events would be enough to question Arc's continued existence, but now the Nvidia partnership has added further concern, especially in light of Intel saying that it intends to use RTX chiplets in mobile and gaming devices, casting a pall over Arc iGPUs. Judging by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam" target="_blank">Steam hardware survey</a>, Intel's share has remained fairly steady over the past couple of years, sitting at 7.9%. If RTX chiplets in mobile devices prove popular, they would certainly eat away at it.</p><p>Intel and Nvidia both claim their partnership won't affect <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/desktop-gpu-roadmap-nvidia-rubin-amd-udna-and-intel-xe3-celestial" target="_blank"><u>existing roadmaps</u></a>, but some in the enthusiast community fear<strong> </strong>that a $5 billion cash influx from Nvidia could come with pressure for Intel not to compete with RTX cards — assuming Nvidia is still fully focused on the gaming market, given how it now represents a small fraction of the company's business.</p><p>We reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-arc-b580-review-the-new-usd249-gpu-champion-has-arrived/">Arc B580</a> in December and found it to have the best value in its price bracket despite some misgivings about its drivers. The $250 price point is hotly contested, and a high volume of sales in this bracket would certainly translate into additional market share for Intel, which has seen the size of its slice remain steady over the past couple of years. The existing Arc roadmap looks promising, but despite Intel's statement, many feel its future is under threat.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Researchers 3D print lightweight ceramic fuel cell — suggests alternative power source for the aerospace industry ]]>
<p>The world of fuel cells just got a jolt thanks to researchers from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). The team has been hard at work developing a new technology that could completely change the way we approach fuel cell manufacturing. The new process involves 3D printing and results in what the team refers to as the "Monolithic Gyroidal Solid Oxide Cell" (or just "The Monolith" for short). This work was reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/monolithic-gyroidal-solid-oxide-cells-by-additive-manufacturing" target="_blank">Interesting Engineering,</a> along with a journal published on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/monolithic-gyroidal-solid-oxide-cells-by-additive-manufacturing" target="_blank">DTU</a> website.</p><p>The team implemented a custom design inspired by the natural construction of coral. This shape optimizes surface area while the material composition allows for a much lighter-weight end product. Most fuel cells are comprised of metal, which contributes greatly to their weight. This fuel cell is apparently completely ceramic.</p><p>The intricate design is known as a gyroid and is a type of triply periodic minimal surface (shortened to TPMS). These surfaces are intended to provide as much surface area as possible. It's beneficial, particularly in this case, as the surface provides more optimal heat dispersion. According to the development team, the cell is capable of producing more than a watt of power for each gram of its own weight.</p><p>The material also has a surprisingly noteworthy amount of durability. When testing the fuel cell's ability to withstand temperature fluctuations, it managed to handle temperatures as high as 212° F (100° C). It also maintained its structural integrity when alternating between both power-storing and generating modes.</p><p>The fuel cell also features something called "Electrolysis Mode" which increases the hydrogen production rate almost tenfold compared to standard fuel cells. The 3D printing aspect of the design also helps make the manufacturing process easier than regular fuel cells.</p><p>If you want to get into the world of 3D printing but aren't sure where to start, check out our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-3d-printers">best 3D printers</a> to see what we recommend and why.

I mention Corel Linux (a Debian-based distro) because that was the first Linux distro that worked for me. The installer felt, dare I say it? More Windows than Linux, and for someone moving over, it was easier to use.</p><p>Corl Linux was great fun, and the CDE (a variant of KDE) user interface was similar to Windows of that era, so not too much for me to learn. Corel Linux just gave me a basic install, not too many apps to choose from, but enough.

The app menus were rammed full of stuff that I had no idea about.</p><p>I loved Mandrake Linux. It felt great and worked well on the hardware of the era.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia wants 10Gbps HBM4 to blunt AMD’s MI450, report claims — company said to be pushing suppliers for more bandwidth ]]>
<p>Nvidia is pressing its memory vendors to push beyond JEDEC’s official HBM4 baseline. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250918-12719.html" target="_blank"><em>TrendForce</em></a>, the company has requested 10Gb/s-per-pin stacks for its 2026 Vera Rubin platform, a move designed to raise per-GPU bandwidth ahead of AMD’s next-generation MI450 Helios systems.</p><p>At 8Gb/s per pin — the rate JEDEC specifies for HBM4 — a single stack delivers just under 2 TB/s across the new 2,048-bit interface. Raising that to 10Gb/s bumps the total to 2.56 TB/s per stack. With six stacks, a single GPU clears 15 TB/s of raw bandwidth. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rubin-cpx-die-shot-reveals-graphics-specific-hardware-blocks-not-needed-for-an-ai-gpu-rubin-cpx-may-form-the-foundation-of-next-gen-rtx-6090">Rubin CPX</a>, Nvidia's compute-optimized config built to handle the most demanding inference workloads, is advertised with 1.7 petabytes per second across a full NVL144 rack. The higher the pin speed, the less margin Nvidia needs elsewhere to hit those numbers.</p><p>But driving 10Gb/s HBM4 isn’t a given. Faster I/O brings higher power, tighter timing, and more strain on the base die. TrendForce notes that Nvidia may segment Rubin SKUs by HBM tier if costs or thermals spike. That means 10Gb/s parts for Rubin CPX and lower-speed stacks for the standard Rubin configuration. The fallback is already in view: staggered supplier qualification and extended validation windows to stretch yield.</p><p>SK hynix remains Nvidia’s dominant HBM supplier and says it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/sk-hynix-completes-development-of-hbm4-2-048-bit-interface-and-10-gt-s-speeds-promised">completed HBM4 development</a> and is ready for mass production. The company has referenced “over 10Gb/s” capability but hasn’t published die specs, power targets, or process details.</p><p>Samsung, by contrast, is more aggressive on node migration. Its HBM4 base die is moving to 4nm FinFET, a logic-class node intended to support higher clock speeds and lower switching power. That could give Samsung an edge at the high end, even if SK hynix ships more volume. Micron has confirmed sampling of HBM4 with a 2,048-bit interface and bandwidth exceeding 2 TB/s, but hasn’t said whether 10Gb/s is in scope.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/amd-preps-rack-scale-instinct-mi450x-if128-with-128-gpus-to-challenge-nvidias-vr200-nvl144-in-2026">AMD’s MI450 is still on the horizon</a>, but the memory spec is already known. Helios racks are expected to support up to 432GB of HBM4 per GPU, giving AMD a route to match or exceed Nvidia on raw capacity. With CDNA 4, it also gains architectural upgrades that aim squarely at Rubin’s inference advantage.</p><p>Nvidia clearly wants to make memory faster. But the more it leans on 10Gb/s HBM4, the more exposed it becomes to supplier variation, yield risks, and rack-level power constraints at a time when the margin for error is shrinking.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ $115 million ransomware hacker arrested over extortion attacks — Scattered Spider alumnus allegedly involved in over 120 computer network intrusions targeting 47 U.S. entities ]]>
<p>A teenage hacker from the UK has been arrested on charges of money laundering conspiracy, computer fraud, and wire fraud conspiracy, and stands accused of being part of a hacking group that extorted over $115 million from close to 50 victims in America, alongside various attacks in the UK, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-kingdom-national-charged-connection-multiple-cyber-attacks-including-critical" target="_blank">Department of Justice</a>. Alleged to be part of the infamous "Scattered Spider" hacking group, it seems that 19-year-old Thalha Jubair wasn't one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/hacker-ransomware-groups-announce-retirement-to-enjoy-their-golden-parachutes-no-further-attacks-planned-future-attributed-activities-will-relate-to-undisclosed-past-breaches">lucky few who were able to ride off into the sunset</a> after its retirement announcement earlier this month.</p><p>Jubair is alleged to have been involved in at least 120 different computer network intrusions over a three-year period, starting in 2022. The complaint, filed with the District of New Jersey, accuses Jubair of targeting 47 U.S. entities. He and the group he was a part of, Scattered Spider, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/jaguar-land-rover-shuts-down-production-due-to-ransomware-attack-scattered-lapsus-usd-hunters-takes-responsibility">were well known for utilizing social engineering techniques to gain access to corporate networks</a> and then steal data or use ransomware attacks to blackmail and extort the businesses for profit.</p><p>Over just the past few years, Jubair is alleged to have extorted over $115 million from victims all over the world. Although the FBI Newark field office is investigating the case, it's doing so in conjunction with the UK National Crime Agency and City of London Police, as well as police agencies in the Netherlands, Romania, Canada, and Australia.</p><p>He also seems to have had particular involvement in controlling the money extracted from victims. Portions of the ransom payments were sent to cryptocurrency wallets controlled by Jubair. In July 2024, when law enforcement seized the server said to be storing the wallets containing cryptocurrency worth some $36 million, Jubair is alleged to have transferred some of those tokens, with a reported net worth of $8.4 million, to another wallet.</p><p>“The arrest of Thalha Jubair underscores an undeniable truth: no matter how elusive or destructive these cyber-criminal syndicates are, we will continue to pursue those who allegedly extort our businesses and ensure they are held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Stefanie Roddy for the FBI.</p><p>Jubair was arrested in London and was formally charged on September 18. Alongside the charges in U.S. courts, he also stands accused of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="" target="_blank">attack against Transport for London (TFL) infrastructure</a> in August 2024, where customer data, including names, contact details, and addresses, were compromised.</p><p>London police also arrested a fellow accused hacker, 18-year-old Owen Flowers, who also stands accused of involvement with the TFL hack. Flowers faces additional charges in the U.S., too, where he's accused of attacking health companies SSM Health Care Corporation and Sutter Health.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ I have the most luxurious standing desk imaginable, but I can't quite bring myself to game while standing ]]>
<p>For more than two-and-a-half years, I've been blessed to call the inimitable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://secretlab.co/pages/magnus-pro">Secretlab Magnus Pro</a> my main workspace. A colossal sit-stand desk, the hulking slab of metal comes with a nifty integrated sit-stand controller, two gargantuan legs, extensive cable management, and an eye-wateringly expensive magnetic ecosystem — the entire surface is magnetic, and can be used with a range of metal cable management devices, headphone stands, and cable sleeves. It is truly the Rolls-Royce of office furniture, vast and expensive, the purview of only the most hardcore work surface connoisseurs.</p><p>Yet on reflection of my time behind Secretlab's (probably) bombproof behemoth, I've come to the awful realization that I might have played myself. Somewhere along the way these last two years, I simply stopped standing up to use this desk, a full 50% of this desk's potential left on the table, if you'll pardon the pun. More specifically, I've realized that I own one of the world's most luxurious standing desks for gaming, yet I never stand up to game.</p><p>The benefits of using a standing desk are well-documented and numerous. Did you know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24297826/" target="_blank">standing up at your desk</a> after lunch can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 43%?<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10973891/" target="_blank"> Reducing your time spent</a> sitting can lower blood pressure in older adults, reduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/00140139.2024.2414197?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank">pain and fatigue</a>, and, of course, help your posture. There's even some evidence to suggest that moving between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.14634" target="_blank">sitting and standing makes you more productive at work</a>.</p><p>But it's not productivity I'm after. While I've historically been happy to stand up at my desk for work, it's for play where I've generally neglected standing up altogether, leading to my realisation that I've stopped standing up completely while at my desk and probably need to take a long, hard look at myself. But it got me thinking: Is there any market at all for a desk that lets you stand whilst gaming? The Magnus Pro is dynamite for productivity, but would I <em>ever</em> want to stand up to game behind it?</p><h2 id="a-place-called-vertigo-2">A place called vertigo</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

Notably, gaming is generally a relaxing thing you do to unwind. The bash marks on my Xbox controller and that Samsung monitor I smashed in 2017 might disagree with me, but for inexplicable reasons, I feel like anyone standing up to game would generally be untrustworthy. <br><br>I associate standing up to game with those old Xbox 360 arcade machines you'd find at GameStop (or your local equivalent), or with going to the Casino. If you dialled into an Xbox Live party or your usual Discord haunt and found out that one of your friends was standing up to play during that particular session, you'd probably ask them if everything was okay, or perhaps if there was something wrong with their chair.</p><p>Either gaming is relaxing (like a nice leisurely <em>Rome Total War </em>conquest), or it is quite intense (the throngs of the new <em>Battlefield 6</em>). For me, both call for the planted assurance of being sat in a sturdy chair (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review-superior-gaming-chair">Secretlab's Titan Evo</a> if you were wondering).

Perhaps then, the beauty of a sit-stand desk dedicated to gamers is to be found in the work half of your work-life balance. Stand up during the day and get the posture and circulatory benefits while you're at work, then put your feet up at the end of the day.
I might try my hand at a little upright recreation going forward, but I can't help thinking that I'll last maybe five minutes before I decide I'd much rather sit down. <br><br>Have you gamed while standing up since the heyday of arcades?

<![CDATA[ Nvidia drops a cool $900 million on Enfabrica tech and hiring its CEO, report claims — AI networking chip company boasts capacity to connect 100,000 GPUs together ]]>
<p>Nvidia has reportedly paid out more than $900 million to hire the CEO of AI networking hardware company, Enfabrica. Rochan Sankar and a number of his colleagues at Enfabrica will become Nvidia staff members as part of the deal, and Nvidia will get the option to license the company's hardware, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/18/nvidia-spent-over-900-million-on-enfabrica-ceo-ai-startup-technology.html" target="_blank">according to CNBC. </a></p><p>The deal will reportedly involve cash and stock options, and comes just two years after Nvidia invested part of a $125 million fund into Enfabrica. However, while the company was valued in the high hundreds of millions, paying close to a billion dollars for a handful of staff and a license would potentially value the company much higher. Clearly, Enfabrica has talent and technology that Nvidia feels is crucial to its ongoing development. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the report.</p><p>Indeed, it's not hard to see why. Nvidia's meteoric rise in value and prominence in recent years has been on the back of its AI hardware developments. Today, its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-gb200-production-ramps-up-after-suppliers-tackle-ai-server-overheating-and-liquid-cooling-leaks"> GPUs power many of the world's data centers </a>(and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-is-building-100-ai-factories-jensens-50-year-gambit-begins">"AI factories"</a>) with 72 within each of the latest Blackwell GPU stacks. In some of these data centers, though, 10s or even hundreds of thousands of GPUs can be working in conjunction to power the latest AI technologies, and it's the connections between those chips that Enfabrica may be able to help improve.</p><p>Nvidia has touted its NVLink technology for allowing high-speed communication between its GPUs, allowing them to work on the same task in parallel without bottlenecking one another or causing synchronization issues.

<![CDATA[ Here's how I installed Windows 11 using a nano-sized 2.4GB ISO — final install weighed in at a mere 8.36GB, two-thirds the size of a normal Windows install, courtesy of Nano11 Builder ]]>
<p>I’ve yet to make the leap to Windows 11; I’ve got an IT request form to file, and I’ll probably need a weekend to migrate all of my files. I’m probably best known for being a Linux and Raspberry Pi advocate, so why should I want to move to Windows 11? Well, firstly, I have to for my work. However, I also edit videos using DaVinci Resolve, and yes, you can install it on Linux, but I’ve yet to be successful.</p><p>Recently, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/nano11-compresses-windows-11-install-footprint-to-as-little-as-2-8gb-extreme-experimental-script-is-3-5-times-smaller-than-tiny11-and-comes-with-none-of-the-fluff"><u>covered a story</u></a> on NTDEV’s latest project to shrink the Windows 11 installation ISO image. The project, Nano11 Builder, aims to create the smallest ISO possible, but it is “an extreme experimental script designed for creating a quick and dirty development testbed,” according to the pseudonymous developer.</p><p>Why would you use such a tool to make smaller ISOs? Because you can, and they could be useful for developing your own appliances based on Windows. Should you use it for mission-critical applications? Absolutely not, but am I going to give it a go and see how small an installation I can create? Of course!</p><h2 id="creating-the-smallest-windows-11-isos-possible-2">Creating the smallest Windows 11 ISOs possible</h2><div ><table><caption>ISO Sizes</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

No, seriously, I waited a long time for the scripts to complete, around 90 minutes on my Lenovo X390 with an eighth-generation Intel Core i5.</p><p>The base ISO is direct from Microsoft, and it weighs in at 5,695,402KB (5.69GB), which isn’t huge by today's standards, but it is bulging with applications and tools that some users may not want or need. The Tiny version of the ISO is half the size of the base ISO, and the nano is nearly two-thirds the size of the base image. A smaller ISO means that plenty of apps and features have been removed, leaving us with a core Windows 11 installation.</p><p>With that in mind, how small is the final installation for each of the ISOs? There is only one way to find out, and it is going to take a little more time.</p><h2 id="installing-windows-11-three-times-for-science-2">Installing Windows 11 Three Times…for Science?</h2><div ><table><caption>ISO Sizes</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

For the full Windows 11 installation, I used a Lenovo X220, a machine that is clearly not intended to run Windows 11. I did need to use Rufus to write the ISO images to a USB flash drive, including a quick hack to bypass RAM, TPM, and Secure Boot requirements.</p><p>Why the difference? Because after successfully installing Windows 11 Nano and Tiny ISOs in the VM, the full Windows 11 ISO would not install in the VM, despite meeting the requirements. As the focus is on the installation size, the tests are valid.</p><p>Installing Nano started off simple. A few steps were skipped (no reg key and no choice of Windows 11 version), and the installation started. I got to 75% and then the installer crashed with an error, and the laptop rebooted. I tried again. Same issue. How did I bypass it? Well, it took raising a GitHub issue, receiving a suggestion to try the older setup process, and yes, it worked!</p><p>Installation was slow on my VM, and at times I had to reboot, but I got there in the end.

Throw all of this into a DIY arcade cabinet build and never update it, or connect it to the Internet, and you’ve got yourself a great gaming setup from recycled kit.</p><p>Now, I need to send that form to IT before October 14…</p>

<![CDATA[ Huawei unveils Atlas 950 SuperCluster — promises 1 ZettaFLOPS FP4 performance and features hundreds of thousands of 950DT APUs ]]>
<p>Huawei has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2025/9/hc-xu-keynote-speech">unveiled</a> its next-generation data-center scale AI solution that can offer 1 FP4 ZettaFLOPS performance for AI inference and 524 FP8 ExaFLOPS for AI training at its Huawei Connect 2025 conference on Thursday. The new SuperCluster 950 system runs hundreds of thousands of the company's Ascend 950DT neural processing units (NPUs) and promises to be one of the most powerful supercomputers for artificial intelligence on the planet. Huawei expects its SuperCluster to compete with Nvidia's Rubin-based systems in late 2026.</p><h2 id="massive-performance-2">Massive performance</h2><p>Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster will consist of 64 Atlas 950 SuperPoDs, which are the company's rack-scale AI solutions akin to Nvidia's GB300 NVL72 or the next-generation Vera Rubin NVL144. The Atlas 950 SuperCluster will be built upon 524,288 Ascend 950DT AI accelerators distributed across over 10,240 optically interconnected cabinets.</p><p>The supercomputer purportedly offers up to 524 FP8 ExaFLOPS for AI training and up to 1 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for AI inference (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://huggingface.co/blog/RakshitAralimatti/learn-ai-with-me">MXFP4</a> to be more specific), which puts it just behind leading-edge AI supercomputers, such as Oracle's OCI Supercluster running 131,072 B200 GPUs and offering peak performance of up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-and-oracle-team-up-for-zettascale-cluster-available-with-up-to-131072-blackwell-gpus">2.4 FP4 ZettaFLOPS for inference introduced last year</a>. Keep in mind these figures pertain to peak performance numbers, so it remains to be seen whether they can be achieved in real life.</p><p>This SuperCluster is designed to support both RoCE (Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet) and Huawei's proprietary UBoE (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-to-open-source-its-ub-mesh-data-center-scale-interconnect-soon-details-technical-aspects-one-interconnect-to-rule-them-all-is-designed-to-replace-everything-from-pcie-to-tcp-ip">UnifiedBus</a> over Ethernet) protocols, though it remains to be seen how fast the latter will be adopted. According to Huawei, UBoE offers lower idle-state latency, higher hardware reliability, and requires fewer switches and optical modules than traditional RoCE setups.</p><p>Huawei positions its Atlas 950 SuperCluster to support training and inference workloads for AI models with hundreds of billions to tens of trillions of parameters. Huawei believes this platform is well-suited for the next wave of large-scale dense and sparse models, thanks to its combination of compute throughput, interconnect bandwidth, and system stability. Though given its size, it is unclear how many companies will be able to accommodate the system.</p><h2 id="massive-footprint-2">Massive footprint</h2><p>Huawei admits that it cannot build processors that would challenge Nvidia's GPUs in terms of performance. Therefore, to achieve 1 ZettaFLOPS with the Atlas 950 SuperCluster, it intends to use a brute force approach, utilizing hundreds of thousands of AI accelerators to compete against Nvidia Rubin-based clusters in 2026–2027.</p><p>A common building block of Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster is the Atlas 950 SuperPoD that integrates 8,192 Ascend 950DT chips, representing a 20-fold increase in processing units compared to the Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD (also known as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huaweis-new-ai-cloudmatrix-cluster-beats-nvidias-gb200-by-brute-force-uses-4x-the-power">CloudMatrix 384</a>) and a massive increase in compute performance — 8 FP8 ExaFLOPS and 16 FP4 ExaFLOPS.</p><p>Performance of the Atlas 950 SuperCluster is truly impressive on paper; it is said to be massively higher compared to Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL144 (1.2 FP8 ExaFLOPS, 3.6 NVFP4 ExaFLOPS), a product that the company compares it to. However, that performance comes at a price, namely size. The Atlas 950 SuperCluster setup includes 160 total cabinets — 128 for computation and 32 for communications — spread across 1,000 square meters, which is about the size of two basketball courts. By contrast, Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL144 is a rack-scale solution that consists of one compute rack and one cable and switch rack that requires just several square meters of space.</p><p>As for Huawei's Atlas 950 SuperCluster — which consists of 64 Atlas 950 SuperPoDs and should measure around 64,000 m2 — its size is comparable to 150 basketball courts, or nine regulation soccer fields. Keep in mind, though, that a real campus would likely require additional space for power rooms, chillers/cooling towers, battery/UPS systems, and support offices, so the total site footprint could be significantly larger than 64,000 m².</p><h2 id="the-road-ahead-2">The road ahead</h2><p>One of the things about selling server hardware is that customers always want to know what is next, so in addition to having a good product, it is vital to have a roadmap. So at the Huawei Connect, the company disclosed plans to launch the Atlas 960 SuperCluster alongside the Atlas 960 SuperPoD in the fourth quarter of 2027.</p><p>This next-generation system will scale up to more than 1 million Ascend 960 NPUs and will provide 2 FP8 ZettaFLOPS and 4 MXFP4 ZettaFLOPS of performance. It will also support both UBoE and RoCE, with the former expected to deliver improved latency and uptime metrics while continuing to rely on Ethernet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Teams at Nvidia and Intel have been working in secret on jointly developed processors for a year — 'The Trump administration has no involvement in this partnership at all' ]]>
<p>Intel and Nvidia have been working on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">jointly developed processors for client and data center products</a> for about a year now as both companies see huge opportunities behind their Intel x86 RTX SoCs and custom Nvidia x86 data center processors. Although the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press call that the Trump administration was pleased with the collaboration between two leading U.S. companies, it had nothing to do with it.</p><h2 id="trump-not-involved-2">Trump not involved</h2><p>"The Trump administration had had no involvement in this partnership at all," said Nvidia's Huang said, during the joint press conference with Nvidia on Thursday. "They would have been very supportive, of course. Today I had the opportunity to tell Secretary [of Commerce Howard] Lutnick and he was very excited and very supportive of seeing two American technology companies working together."</p><p>The work began around a year ago, and preliminary agreements were reached by Intel's then-CEO Pat Gelsinger and Nvidia's Jensen Huang even before that. (A year ago, Joe Biden was president, though no one suggested his administration was involved, either.) Intel and Nvidia are working on custom data center CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI platforms as well as GPU tiles that Intel will integrate into its upcoming client processors. In both cases CPUs and GPUs will use Nvidia's NVLink technology as an I/O interface. By now, there are three teams working together on the joint projects.</p><h2 id="the-work-is-ongoing-2">The work is ongoing</h2><p> "The two technology teams have been discussing and architecting solutions now for probably coming out to a year," said Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. "The two architecture teams… Well, it is three architecture teams are working across... the CPU architecture, as well as product lines for server and PCs. The architecture work is fairly extensive, and the teams are really excited about the new architecture. The teams have been working for a while and we are excited about the announcement today."</p><p>As Huang mentioned teams working on a CPU architecture as well as client and data center product lines, we figure out that Nvidia wants rather deep customizations of Intel's Xeons to meet the needs of its AI platforms.</p><p>The involvement of a CPU architecture team highlights the depth of the partnership between Intel and Nvidia as well as indicates that the CPU company is implementing rather deep optimizations required by next-generation AI platforms. Given Nvidia's history with Grace and Vera CPUs (custom Arm) and the high bandwidth needs of its next-gen GPUs (e.g. Rubin, Feynman, post-Feynman, etc.), it is reasonable to expect tailored cache structures, memory IO, and coherency protocols on these x86 CPUs.<br><br>Such a deep collaboration probably means that custom Intel processors will be used by Nvidia sometimes in the post-Vera Rubin platform era. We would certainly expect Nvidia's data center GPU team to work with Intel as well, but Huang never mentioned one during the call, probably because Feynman GPUs have already been defined by now.</p><p>Yet, he mentioned that there are two more teams working on product lines for server and PC products, which probably points to data center system level architecture team on Nvidia's side as well as client CPU/system level architecture team on Intel's side.</p><p>While the collaboration between Intel and Nvidia on the data center front is a multi-faceted cross-organizational effort, the timing to its fruition is tied to emergence of Intel's custom CPUs for Nvidia.</p><p>As for the joint work on client project (or projects), developing an Intel CPU with Nvidia GPU chiplet will take at least three to four years from drawing board to volume production. The collaboration requires deep integration across SoC fabrics, dimensions, performance/power consumption targets, packaging technologies (Foveros, EMIB), and software stacks from both companies. The collaboration likely began in 2024, so the first products could hit the market in late 2027 or early 2028.</p><h2 id="hundreds-of-millions-of-pcs-2">Hundreds of millions of PCs</h2><p>While we do not know for sure when Intel and Nvidia plan to come up with jointly developed products, it looks like they intend to address a broad range of applications. At least, Jensen Huang said that that the two companies plan to build CPUs that could address the vast majority of notebooks, which points to hundreds of millions of devices.</p><p>"Just the notebook market is 150 million notebooks sold each year," said Huang. "So that kind of gives you a sense of the scale of the work that we are going to do here. We are going to address the consumer market, we are going to address a vast majority of that consumer PC market, consumer PC notebook market."</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ xAI's new gas turbine facility gets halfway to Elon Musk's 1-gigawatt 'AI factory' goal ]]>
<p>xAI is moving faster than anyone expected on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/elon-musk-xai-power-plant-overseas-to-power-1-million-gpus"><u>power strategy</u></a>. According to a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semianalysis.com/2025/09/16/xais-colossus-2-first-gigawatt-datacenter/" target="_blank"><u><em>SemiAnalysis</em></u></a>, Elon Musk’s AI startup already has 460MW of natural gas generation either installed or under construction, split between its Memphis campus and a new site across the border in Southaven, Mississippi.</p><p>The numbers check out against state filings and local reporting. Shelby County granted xAI a permit in July for 15 stationary gas turbines at its Paul R. Lowry Road facility in Memphis after months of wrangling with environmental groups, which alleged that dozens of turbines had been running without proper approval. In Mississippi, regulators issued a 12-month authorization to operate gas turbines at 2875 Stanton Road, a property xAI acquired from Duke Energy this summer, while the company builds out a permanent plant.</p><p>Equipment lists emerging from legal disclosures align with SemiAnalysis’s reporting of 12 SMT-130 turbines, rated at roughly 16MW apiece, on the Memphis side, and seven Titan 350 units in Southaven, each capable of more than 35MW. Together, that brings xAI’s on-site capacity close to half a gigawatt, or roughly the output of a midsize utility plant, stood up in less than a year.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">xAI now has 460 MW of natural gas turbines installed and either operating or under construction.

Even after factoring in cooling and overhead, 460MW of generation translates to headroom for nearly 3,000 NVL72 racks, which is more than 200,000 GPUs in total. If xAI succeeds in doubling that to a full gigawatt, it would dwarf most hyperscale campuses in terms of concentrated GPU capacity.</p><p>xAI’s choice of turbine suggests a sense of urgency behind the project. Solar’s SMT-130 and Titan 350 packages are containerized modules designed for rapid deployment, essentially acting as bridge power while xAI transitions to the larger Southaven site. That speed helps sidestep the years-long queue for new grid interconnects, but also explains the geographic shuffle — Tennessee pushback slowed the Memphis approvals, so xAI pivoted to Mississippi, where regulators moved faster.</p><p>Compared with Microsoft and Amazon, which are experimenting with 100-200MW on-site projects, xAI’s goal of leaping straight to a gigawatt sets its power strategy apart from anything else. None of this means xAI is home free. The Memphis permit is already under appeal, and the Southaven authorization is temporary. Critics argue the company is prioritizing speed over compliance, which is a familiar criticism for Musk’s ventures.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> </em><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> </em><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ I managed to snag a Core i5 CPU for $10, because someone scammed Amazon out of an i7-14700 ]]>
<p>The other day, I stopped into a local Amazon returns store on my lunch break. You probably know the type: chaotically overflowing other people's returned orders, with half-open boxes scattered about in huge bins. It's like some kind of post-apocalyptic ball pit game show, where you might find something worthwhile if you wade through enough discarded shelving kits, no-name iPhone cases, and shoe insoles. This particular store is only a few months old, and I'd visited a few times without finding much (other than a pair of insoles, which I needed because I walk 9-10 miles a day).</p><p>On this trip, the first day after a weekly restock, when everything in the bins costs $10, I managed to find a roll of Creality 3D printer PLA filament. That's not a huge discount over its typical Amazon sale price, but I happened to need a new spool for my Anycubic printer, and I was a few blocks from home, so this saved me the hassle of ordering. After a few more minutes pawing through returns, I hadn't found anything else and went up to pay. But there was a line, and I wound up waiting at the corner of one of the closest bins to the register. Killing time, I idly dug around while I waited, and soon spotted the familiar blue of an Intel CPU box. I flipped it over and saw an i7-14700 sticker!<br><br>Could I really have just found the frequency-locked version of Intel's last-generation flagship for $10? And if so, had someone returned it because of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/raptor-lake-instability-saga-continues-as-intel-releases-0x12f-update-to-fix-vmin-instability"> <u>notorious instability issues</u></a>? Something else? I could see the CPU in its plastic clamshell through the cardboard window. The back looked OK, but the top was covered in thermal paste.</p><p>I was suspicious, but by this time, I was next in line, curious, and decided to gamble $10 on Intel. That’s maybe not the smartest wager I could make in 2025, but I was curious, and figured this would at least be more interesting than wasting money on a scratch-off ticket. I checked out with three items: the filament, the CPU, and another pair of shoe insoles – seriously, I wear those things out and can never have enough.</p><p>After paying my $32.25 after tax, I stepped outside, wishing I had a napkin to immediately wipe the thermal paste off with. Instead, I slacked my coworkers about what I had found, while I marched back to my apartment. When I got home, I immediately opened the CPU box, grabbed a paper towel, and wiped the used thermal paste off the CPU's IHS, to be met with immediate disappointment. This wasn't a 14th Gen Core i7 after all!</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Not quite one of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html"><u> best CPUs</u></a>, and a generation older than what the box promised, but still a very usable chip, with 14 cores, 20 threads, and a Turbo Frequency of 4.8 GHz. It's not the fastest chip, but it currently sells for $264 at Newegg – not a bad pickup for $10. If it works, anyway.</p><p>So why was a 13th Gen Core i5 returned in a Core i7-14700 box? For those who haven't already connected the dots, it's likely that someone scammed Amazon by buying a new, higher-end chip than what they had, put the old one back in the box (helpfully obscured by thermal paste), and returned it for a refund. And Amazon, dealing as it does with millions of packages a day, seemingly accepted the return without checking that the returned product was actually what was returned, eventually selling it as part of a lot of liquidated returns.</p><p>I have no way to verify any of this, of course, but it seems the most likely scenario. And it's certainly unsurprising that Amazon would just accept a return without paying someone to open the box, wipe off the thermal paste, and confirm they had received the Core i7-14700 the customer had ordered. There's no way Amazon could continue to run its business if it had to do something like that with even half of its returns.</p><p>The only lingering question I had was whether my $10 13th Gen Core i5 CPU actually works. So I grabbed my trusty Hoto screwdriver, removed the AIO waterblock on the system that previously served as our external SSD storage testbed, and removed the 12th Gen Core i5 CPU that previously resided in the LGA 1700 socket. I then dropped my 13th Gen Core i5 into the motherboard, applied<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/apply-thermal-paste-to-your-cpu"> <u>five small drops of thermal paste</u></a>, re-attached the cooler, and plugged the system back in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The old system booted up without an issue, and after running a few benchmarks, it looks like my $10 chip performs as expected.</p><p>Now the only question is, what should I do with it? I don't need another gaming rig – I'm writing this on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-ryzen-5-7600x-cpu-review"><u>AMD Ryzen 7950X</u></a> / <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review"><u>Nvidia RTX 4090</u></a> PC I built back in 2023, and I already have a few other systems and CPUs for testing PC cases and accessories. Maybe I'll build a system for a family member or friend.</p><p>All I know is, while it didn't turn out to be a 14th Gen Core i7 promised on the box, I'm happy with the results of my $10 CPU gamble, and I wonder what I'll find at the returns store next week. I don't really need any more PC hardware, but if I could pass up enticing tech that I don't really need, I probably wouldn't have gotten into this crazy business in the first place.</p>

<![CDATA[ Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 shows up in Geekbench with a score of 3,831 — upcoming chip catches Apple's just-launched A19 Pro, beats desktop chips on single-core perf ]]>
<p>The upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 was formally announced a few days ago, but now Geekbench leaks are rolling in. <br><br>The keen-eyed X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/never_released/status/1968418182961496131?s=31" target="_blank">Longhorn</a> noticed an unnamed Xiaomi 25113PN0EC device (possibly a Xiaomi 17 Pro) with the Qualcomm SoC inside, posting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13864869" target="_blank">whopping 3,831-point</a> single-threaded score, a value that should put it head-to-head with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apples-a19-pro-beats-ryzen-9-9950x-in-single-thread-geekbench-tests-iphone-17-pro-chip-packs-11-12-percent-cpu-performance-bump-gpu-performance-up-37-percent-over-predecessor"> Apple's A19 Pro SoC</a> inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/apple-debuts-a19-and-a19-pro-processors-for-iphone-17-iphone-air-and-iphone-17-pro">iPhone 17 Pro</a>.</p><p>If that figure is reflective of shipping products, that would be quite the leap for Qualcomm's chips. The company's SoCs have historically trailed Apple's designs by some margin in both performance and efficiency, so catching up would be quite the feat. The A19 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apples-a19-pro-beats-ryzen-9-9950x-in-single-thread-geekbench-tests-iphone-17-pro-chip-packs-11-12-percent-cpu-performance-bump-gpu-performance-up-37-percent-over-predecessor">rings in at close to 3,900</a> points in Geekbench. To put this into perspective, even the mighty Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D post scores of about 3,400 and 3,500, respectively. That's by no means an ultimate measure of real-world performance, but it does display the might of contemporary Arm-based chips, at least in power-constrained scenarios.</p><p>The 3,831-point figure for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 might sound a little too good to be true — particularly as it would mean a generational uplift of over 34% — but it is at least consistent with leaks that showed a purported Samsung handset <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hothardware.com/news/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-2-impresses-in-early-benchmarks-running-at-474ghz" target="_blank">displaying a score of nearly 3,400</a> at only a 4 GHz boost clock speed. Per Qualcomm's recent announcement, the chip uses two performance cores and six efficiency cores, with the performance cores hitting 4.61 GHz in the standard configuration, or 4.74 GHz in a Samsung Galaxy-specific flavor. This makes 3,831 points at least plausible, as the recent score post shows 4.6 GHz for the performance cores. The new SoC is manufactured in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-3nm-update-n3p-in-production-n3x-on-track.">TSMC's 3-nm N3P node</a>, an evolution of the previous N3E.</p><div ><table><caption>Geekbench scores</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 @ 4.6 GHz</p></td><td

><p>~2,850</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>That's not the only noteworthy difference, though. Longhorn points out in their X post that "SVE2 and SME say hello", implying that the new chip ought to support the newer versions of Arm's Scalable Vector Instructions and Scalable Matrix Instructions. Both
of these CPU instruction sets are called "SIMD" (Single Instruction Multiple Operation), making it easy for developers to efficiently process chunks of data at a time with few instructions.</p><p>That means that applications that can make use of those instructions should see quite a significant speed boost. The original SVE was designed for AI-related data processing, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102340/0100/Introducing-SVE2" target="_blank">Arm says that SVE2</a> should cover more broad uses cases, and calls out general-purpose software, multimedia, computer vision, and in-memory databases. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2024/04/geekbench-63/" target="_blank">Geekbench does use SME</a> (which in turn apparently needs a subset of SVE2), so the posted scores should reflect the use of these optimizations.</p><p>By the way, if the "Gen 5" name in this report is throwing you off, know that you're not alone. Many people thought the new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC would be called "Gen 2", but Qualcomm has decided that the "Gen" suffix now applies to its series of Snapdragon products, making this chip the fifth generation, across Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, with the original Snapdragon 8 Elite counting as "Gen 4".</p><p>Of course, consider that these recently-posted figures originate from leakers around the globe and may not reflect production silicon, clock-speed targets, or power envelopes of their final devices. Second, although Geekbench single-core results mostly track with general application performance, that may not be true of every scenario. Regardless, even if figures for production Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices are somewhat lower, that would still be an impressive showing.</p>

<![CDATA[ Silverstone's retro PC FLP02 case launches
— throw-back 5.25-inch expansion bays meet modern 360mm radiator support, likely to be $240 in the US ]]>
<p><strong>09/18/25 update: </strong><em>A few hours after initial publication, a representative from Silverstone reached out to say that the U.S. price for the FLP02 had not yet been set, but that it will likely be around
$240. We changed the headline and removed a reference to a $220 U.S. MSRP at the end of the article.</em><br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside">Initially presented</a> at Computex 2025, Silverstone has launched its new FLP02 (SST-FLP02), a retro-inspired PC case designed to house modern hardware components. The FLP02 is the second old-school-looking case introduced by Silverstone, following the successful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/retro-pc-case-flaunts-floppy-disk-style-bay-cover-silverstone-flp01-will-sell-for-around-usd130">FLP01</a>.</p><p>Silverstone manufactures the FLP02 using steel and plastic, and it is finished with the characteristic beige color reminiscent of the good old days. The case dimensions are 9.13 x 19.45 x 18.58 inches (232 x 494 x 472mm), a moderate size by today's standards. With a weight of 21.6 pounds (9.79 kg), the FLP02 is not overly heavy, allowing it to be conveniently placed on a desk, which is an appropriate location for display purposes.</p><p>The FLP02 accommodates mini-ATX, microATX, ATX, and SSI-CEB motherboards. Considering the dimensions of the FLP02, a mini-ATX motherboard may appear disproportionate within the case; however, individual preferences vary. The FLP02 is equipped with a total of seven expansion slots, with an additional two slots available should you choose to install the graphics card in a vertical orientation.</p><p>Regarding the dimensions of graphics cards, the maximum length is 15.2 inches (386 mm) when the front 3.5-inch/2.5-inch combo bay drive cage is not installed, and 11 inches (279 mm) when it is installed. In terms of width, the maximum is 7.4 inches (188 mm) without the GPU brace, and 6 inches with it installed. Consequently, even large graphics cards such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review">GeForce RTX 5090</a> are compatible with the FLP02 case. The case accepts power supplies with a length of up to 9.8 inches (250mm), so even monstrous power supplies, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/power-supplies/corsair-launches-gargantuan-3-000w-power-supply-for-usd599-99-comes-with-four-native-12v-2x6-600w-gpu-cables">Corsair's 3,000W unit,</a> can fit easily into the FLP02.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The case comes with two front 120mm fan mounts and one rear fan mount accommodating either a 120mm or 140mm fan. Silverstone supplies three black cooling fans with the FLP02. The top fan mounts offer greater flexibility, allowing for configurations of either three 120mm fans, two 140mm fans, or two 160mm fans. Regarding radiator support, 120mm and 140mm radiators are compatible at the front, while the top accommodates radiators ranging from 120mm to 360mm in size.</p><p>If you prefer air cooling, the FLP02 has you covered as well.

More importantly, this model comes with 32 GB of DDR5 RAM — which is plenty already — but you can upgrade the vacant SODIMM slots to add even more. The same goes for the storage, you get 1TB PCIe 4.0 storage that can be expanded with the extra M.2 NVMe slot.

It's no OLED, but the 16:10 aspect ratio offers a bit more screen real estate, and the 1440p resolution keeps things looking sharp no matter what. That screen is accompanied by a solid RGB-lit keyboard, trackpad, and 1080p webcam with Windows Hello. The Aero X16 is healthy in terms of connectivity, too, offering multiple USB-C and USB-A ports with fast speeds, along with HDMI 2.1, headphone jack, and a gigabit Ethernet port.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft is planning to bring the "world&apos;s most powerful" AI datacenter online in early 2026, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/09/18/inside-the-worlds-most-powerful-ai-datacenter/" target="_blank">company announced</a> today. The Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin-based datacenter, dubbed Fairwater, is. meant specifically for training AI models as well as running large-scale models. The datacenter will be housed on 315 acres of land, with 1.2 million square feet in three buildings to house "hundreds of thousands" of Nvidia GB200 and GB300 GPUs.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If intelligence is the log of compute… it starts with a lot of compute!

<![CDATA[ Valve to drop Steam support for 32-bit Windows versions next year — says it's no longer compatible with core client features, only 0.01% of players actually used it ]]>
<p>Valve is dropping support for Steam running on 32-bit versions of Windows, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/49A1-B944-48B8-FF00" target="_blank">starting January 1, 2026</a>. Steam has been available on Windows for more than two decades and, therefore, was built with 32-bit systems in mind. Today, every modern computer is 64-bit, with compatibility layers built in to support older 32-bit apps. So, even though 32-bit apps have carried forward, there's really no place for 32-bit operating systems anymore — which is why Valve is axing support for them.</p><p>It's important to understand the distinction between 32-bit apps and operating systems. Steam itself is 32-bit, partly because it's from that era, but mostly because it doesn't need to be updated to a 64-bit instruction set, given its lightweight nature. A lot of games on Steam are also 32-bit. None of that will be affected by the sunsetting of 32-bit Windows support, since it's only support for the operating system itself that's being phased out. Windows 10 32-bit is the only version Steam currently supports anyways, and Valve says just 0.01% of players are still using it today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The company advises gamers to upgrade to 64-bit Windows to keep receiving timely updates and assistance. This move somewhat aligns with Microsoft's own plans for Windows 10, which will completely lose official support next month. Steam should still continue to run on 64-bit versions of Windows 10, however, which makes up 35% of all Steam users right now.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Steam will stop supporting 32-bit versions of Windows from next year. Valve says the libraries and drivers needed for core client features are no longer compatible with 32-bit architecture, and therefore need to be left behind. Upgrade to Windows 10 64-bit, or Windows 11, to keep receiving timely updates and assistance.
