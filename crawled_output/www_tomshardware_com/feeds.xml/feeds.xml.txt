<![CDATA[ Elon Musk's Grok AI to be used by US government at a price of 42 cents per agency — Trump admin joining Meta, OpenAI in recent trend of AI govt contracts ]]>
<p>Grok, xAI's flagship chatbot, has become an officially sanctioned part of United States government operations. xAI and the United States inked a deal on Wednesday that guarantees the use of Grok across the federal government for $0.42 per agency, per the government's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/gsa-xai-partner-to-accelerate-federal-ai-adoption-09252025">press release.</a></p><p>The newly reskinned "Grok for Government", based on the Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast models, is available for all federal agencies effective immediately. The deal lasts for 18 months, terminating in March 2027, and is the longest AI contract yet signed by the government.</p><p>Elon Musk's xAI also offers step-up models focused on higher-security classifications for unknown dollar amounts on a per-agency basis. At all levels of access to Grok for Government, xAI has pledged a "dedicated engineering team" and agency training programs to support governmental Grok and encourage its most efficient use at all times.</p><p>Grok joins Meta, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic in the list of major AI companies that have been contracted by the U.S. government in the last week. The Government Services Administration (GSA) has been moving quickly with its "OneGov" initiative, based on securing a wide field of AI agents, chatbots, and tools for government workers to boost productivity and efficiency.</p><p>"Widespread access to advanced AI models is essential to building the efficient, accountable government that taxpayers deserve," said Federal Acquisition Service Commissioner Josh Gruenbaum in the GSA press release. All other new OneGov LLM deals were also signed for incredibly low price tags, with Meta undercutting the bunch with a zero-dollar deal with the U.S. government.</p><p>This partnership with Grok may come as a surprise for many reasons. Elon Musk, the personality and CEO behind xAI, had a very well-documented and highly contentious falling out with President Donald Trump. The pair began the year as fierce political allies, with Musk heading up Trump's "DOGE" office for governmental cuts, including those that effectively killed the Biden-era <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/elon-musk-ally-leading-chips-act-office-purge-only-14-percent-of-original-staff-remain-after-dismissals">CHIPS and Science Act</a>. But that relationship fractured as Musk stepped down from the government and resulting in a public fallout on social media.</p><p>That xAI is signing deals with the U.S. government under the watch of both Trump and Musk signals to some that the rift between the two may be mending. Musk had begun to walk back his more abrasive takes on the president in recent months, and the pair have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/22/donald-trump-elon-musk-charlie-kirk-doge-epstein/86288615007/">seen together in public</a>.</p><p>GSA's acquisition of Grok as an option for federal workers has attracted its own share of controversy. Civil rights groups signed petitions requesting the Trump administration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fedscoop.com/grok-federal-government-public-citizen-office-budget-management-artificial-intelligence-xai-chatbot/">bar Grok from government</a>, citing the occasional ideological bent of Grok's responses as a violation of Trump's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-announces-ai-action-plan-for-the-united-states-government-policy-roadmap-seeks-to-accelerate-adoption-of-ai-tools-and-spur-infrastructure-buildout-in-the-race-for-global-dominance">AI Action Plan</a>. That plan requires AI used by government to be "neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas." <br><br>Grok's X account famously began calling itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">"MechaHitler"</a> for a few days in July, accompanied by a slew of other posts praising the German Nazi Party during World War 2 and calling for anti-Semitic action. xAI has since "addressed these responses" and assures users they will not happen again.</p>

The United States government has finalized a deal licensing the Grok 4 chatbot for use by federal government workers. This follows recent deals made with OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, but raises eyebrows due to the previously fractured relationship between xAI boss Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

<![CDATA[ HighPoint's adapter enables GPUDirect storage — up to 64 GB/s from drive to GPU, bypassing the CPU ]]>
<p>HighPoint on Thursday <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.highpoint-tech.com/pr/introduces-industry-first-hardware-architecture-for-gpu-direct-nvme-storage">introduced</a> its Rocket 7638D PCIe 5.0 switch card that is designed to enable Nvidia's GPUDirect interconnection between AI GPUs and NVMe storage devices. The device is designed to speed up AI training and inference workloads when operating with software that fully support GPUDirect.</p><p>The latest GPUs from Nvidia (starting from A100) support GPUDirect technologies that enable direct data transfers between GPUs and other devices, such as SSD or network interfaces, bypassing the CPU and system memory to increase performance and free CPU resources for other workloads. However, GPUDirect requires support both from the GPU and from a PCIe switch that supports P2P DMA capability, but not all PCIe Gen5 switches support this feature, which is where switch cards come into play.</p><p>HighPoint's Rocket 7638D switch card packs the Broadcom PEX 89048 switch enabling system integrators to build systems with GPUDirect capability. The adapter features 48 PCIe 5.0 lanes: 16 lanes to connect to host, 16 lanes to connect to external GPU box using a CDFP CopprLink connector, and 16 lanes are dedicated to internal NVMe storage devices using MCIO 8i connectors. The MCIO ports support up to 16 NVMe drives, enabling configurations with up to 2PB of high-performance storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The device (or rather systems that it enables) is particularly useful in scenarios involving large-scale training datasets that use plenty of storage.</p><p>Since the the Broadcom PEX 89048 switch chip contains an Arm-based CPU, it is completely independent and self managed, so it is compatible with both Arm and x86 platforms. The adapter works out of the box with all major operating systems, without the need for special drivers or additional software installation.</p><p>The Rocket 7638D includes field-service features such as VPD tracking for hardware and firmware matching and a utility that monitors health status and PCIe link performance. These tools simplify troubleshooting and replacement, especially in multi-node or hyperscale installations where hardware tracking matters.</p><p>HighPoint did not disclose pricing of its Rocket 7638D switch card, which will probably depend on volumes and other factors.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Every RTX 50 Series card hits MSRP or lower in Walmart blowout — GeForce week sees $100 off some cards ]]>
<p>Gamers and those in need of a new and more powerful graphics card rejoice, for finally, we are seeing some real drops in GPU prices that are actually taking the discounts below that mythical MSRP price.

<![CDATA[ Micron teams up with TSMC to deliver HBM4E, targeted for 2027 — collaboration could enable further customization ]]>
<p>Micron has confirmed it will partner with TSMC to manufacture the base logic die for its next-generation HBM4E memory, with production targeted for 2027. The announcement, made during the company’s fiscal Q4 earnings call on September 23, adds yet more detail to an already busy roadmap.</p><p>Micron is shipping early HBM4 samples at speeds above 11 Gbps per pin, providing up to 2.8TB/s of bandwidth, and it has already locked down most of its 2026 HBM3E supply agreements. But the big takeaway is that Micron will hand TSMC the task of fabricating both standard and custom HBM4E logic dies, opening the door to tailored memory solutions for AI workloads.</p><p>The decision also places Micron squarely in the middle of the next wave of AI system design, aligning with previous reporting on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/hbm-roadmaps-for-micron-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-hbm4-and-beyond">HBM roadmaps across Micron, SK hynix, and Samsung</a>, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/microns-hbm4e-heralds-a-new-era-of-customized-memory-for-ai-gpus-and-beyond">earlier analysis</a> of how Micron views HBM4E as a platform for customization.</p><h2 id="a-semi-configurable-subsystem-2">A semi-configurable subsystem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

SK hynix has already confirmed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/sk-hynix-completes-development-of-hbm4-2-048-bit-interface-and-10-gt-s-speeds-promised">12-Hi HBM4 with a full 2048-bit interface running at 10 GT/s</a>, while Samsung is plotting similar capacities with its own logic processes. Micron is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/micron-starts-to-ship-samples-of-hbm4-memory-to-clients-36-gb-capacity-and-bandwidth-of-2-tb-s">shipping its own HBM4 stacks</a> and claims more than 20% better efficiency than HBM3E.</p><p>HBM4E is the extension of that roadmap, but Micron is treating it as something more. The company highlighted that the base die will be fabricated at TSMC, not in-house, and that custom logic-die designs will be offered to customers willing to pay a premium. By opening the base die to customization, Micron is effectively turning HBM into a semi-configurable subsystem. Instead of a one-size-fits-all interface layer, GPU vendors could request additional SRAM, dedicated compression engines, or tuned signal paths.</p><p>That approach mirrors what we have seen from SK hynix, which has already described customizable base dies as part of its HBM4 strategy. Given that customized memory is stickier, more profitable, and more important for customers trying to squeeze every watt and every cycle out of an AI accelerator, this is likely to become a lucrative segment of the market.</p><h2 id="the-importance-of-ai-2">The importance of AI</h2><p>The timing of Micron’s plans for HBM4E looks to be no accident. Nvidia and AMD both have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-enterprise-roadmap-rubin-rubin-ultra-feynman-and-silicon-photonics">next-generation data center GPUs slated for 2026</a> that will introduce HBM4, and HBM4E looks perfectly aligned to their successors.</p><p>Nvidia’s Rubin architecture, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-announces-rubin-gpus-in-2026-rubin-ultra-in-2027-feynam-after">expected to follow Blackwell in 2026</a>, is built around HBM4. Rubin-class GPUs are projected to deliver around 13 TB/s of memory bandwidth and up to 288GB of capacity, a jump from the 8 TB/s ceiling on Hopper with HBM3E. A follow-on platform, Rubin Ultra, is already on Nvidia’s roadmap for 2027. That platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/desktop-gpu-roadmap-nvidia-rubin-amd-udna-and-intel-xe3-celestial">specifically calls for HBM4E<u>,</u></a> with each GPU supporting up to a terabyte of memory and aggregate rack-level bandwidth measured in petabytes per second.</p><p>AMD’s trajectory is just as aggressive. Its Instinct MI400 family, expected around the same time as Rubin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-says-instinct-mi400x-gpu-is-10x-faster-than-mi300x-will-power-helios-rack-scale-system-with-epyc-venice-cpus">is also moving to HBM4</a>. Leaks suggest as much as 432 GB of HBM4 and 19.6 TB/s of bandwidth, more than double what AMD's MI350 delivers today. Like Rubin, MI400 uses a chiplet design, bound by ultra-wide memory buses, making HBM4 a necessity. After that is HBM4E, which is set for 2027 or 2028, depending on yields and ecosystem readiness.</p><p>This cadence makes Micron’s partnership with TSMC particularly important. By shifting the base die to a leading-edge logic process and offering customization, Micron can synchronize its roadmap with the needs of Rubin Ultra, MI400 successors, and whatever comes next in the accelerator space.</p><p>Thinking of the bigger picture, Micron’s partnership with TSMC raises questions around how HBM4E might proliferate widely into AI data centers. Right now, only the highest-end GPUs and TPUs use HBM, with the majority of servers still relying on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/the-future-of-dram-from-ddr5-advancements-to-future-ics">DDR5 or LPDDR</a>. That could change dramatically as workloads keep ballooning in size.</p><p>Micron has already said that its HBM customer base has grown to six, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-wants-10gbps-hbm4-to-rival-amd-mi450">with Nvidia among them</a>. The company is also working with Nvidia on deploying LPDDR in servers. The partnership with TSMC suggests that Micron intends to make HBM4E a broadly adopted piece of AI infrastructure, potentially making HBM4E the standard tier of memory for AI nodes in the second half of the decade.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Qualcomm's Snapdragon X2 Elite reference mini PC looks like a coaster — some designs are cooled by Frore AirJets ]]>
<p>At Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-x2-elite-extreme-and-elite-chips-for-pcs-stretch-up-to-a-record-5-ghz-3nm-arm-chips-sport-new-oryon-prime-cores" target="_blank">unveiled its Snapdragon X2 Elite</a> processors for PCs. They serve as the follow-up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/qualcomm-snapdragon-elite-x-oryon-pc-cpu-specs?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">last year's X Elite series,</a> which served as a kickstart for Windows on Arm and made an attempt to rival Apple's M-series. Qualcomm's reference designs on display at the summit included laptops, tablets, and some fascinating mini PCs, including a circular puck and a small square that docks into a monitor.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It's a tier above even the X2 Elite, which begs the question: how is it so thin? We know that some of Qualcomm's concepts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/fanless-airjet-mini-g2-cooler-promises-42-percent-higher-performance-at-the-same-form-factor">were cooled by Frore AirJets</a>, so it's possible solid state cooling played a role.</p><p>The completely circular design is unlike anything we've seen before — it's like if someone took a trash-can Mac Pro and squashed it down to look like a coaster. It even appears like a modern Apple computer from the bottom, and has suitably similar I/O in the form of two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a barrel jack connection for power. The device also seems to be milled from aluminum, with a Snapdragon red finish.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

This one's a bit different because it's intentionally squared to fit in as part of a modular all-in-one system. The mini PC slides into a base, connected to a large monitor, which it subsequently powers.</p><p>It feels like an upgrade to all-in-one computers that have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-slimmest-aio-aspire-s24-available-us,36793.html" target="_blank">existed for decades</a>, but this one looks like you could swap out the computing parts.</p><p>Speaking of which, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/snapdragon-summit-qualcomm-slim-fanless-desktop-pcs-snapdragon-x2-elite" target="_blank">did tell PC Mag</a> that it's working with at least three OEMs in Taiwan.

<![CDATA[ CoreWeave deal with OpenAI now worth $22.4 billion — another $6.4 billion of AI data center capacity added ]]>
<p>Every time a new day dawns in the world of AI, billions of dollars change hands in massive deals. The latest arrangement is by CoreWeave, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-expands-agreement-with-openai-by-up-to-6-5b" target="_blank">signing up</a> to provide AI datacenter capacity to OpenAI, to the tune of a cool $6.5 billion.</p><p>This collaboration is the second expansion of an existing agreement. The initial deal was struck in March for $11.9 billion, and later revised in May for an additional $4 billion. Adding up today's contract, the partnership totals $22.4 billion.</p><p>This is yet another aggressive expansion play on behalf of OpenAI, which has been cutting deals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-makes-flurry-of-deals-in-drive-towards-for-profit-model-ai-giant-teams-up-with-nvidia-luxshare-apple-and-more">left</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-usd100-billion-investment-in-openai-raises-big-antitrust-concerns-legal-experts-and-policymakers-raise-eyebrows-over-potential-for-market-imbalance">right</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-and-openai-forge-usd100-billion-alliance-to-deliver-10-gigawatts-of-nvidia-hardware-for-ai-datacenters">center</a> for as much computing power as it can get its proverbial hands on. Sam Altman's venture intends to build a massive datacenter infrastructure, but as fast-moving as the AI business is, presumably it'll take whatever it can rent right this second, as illustrated by today's CoreWeave deal.</p><p>If the CoreWeave name rings unfamiliar, it's because the company has only been making headlines fairly recently. It started out as Atlantic Crypto and invested in Ethereum mining, pivoting to renting out its GPU infrastructure to other companies. It continued to invest heavily in high-end Nvidia GPUs, a move that paid dividends around 2022, when almost every newcomer in the AI space needed the processing capacity that CoreWeave could provide.</p><p>After continued expansion and investment (including from Nvidia), CoreWeave inked a $2.3 billion debt financing deal using its H100 GPUs as collateral, in a world-first move. The company was also the first to deploy Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 (NVL72) rack units. CoreWeave currently has dozens of datacenters, mainly around the U.S., plus five locations in Europe. Microsoft is still by far its largest customer, accounting for around 70% of its revenue in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank">June 2025 filings</a>.</p><p>That statement might be a bit puzzling, but it makes sense considering that CoreWeave's main business has been AI-specific datacenters and services almost from the ground up. This is in contrast to familiar names in the cloud computing industry like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle, and even Microsoft's own Azure.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ SlimeMoldCrypt relies on gloopy living organism’s ever-changing network of tendrils for its dynamic, biological, encryption engine — inventor claims concept is resistant to decryption 'even by quantum machines' ]]>
<p>A new device hopes to harden cryptography by leveraging icky-sounding organisms called slime molds. This idea might sound decidedly weird in the context of a brief headline. However, the underlying concept is that the chaotic and unpredictable tendrils of slime create patterns that are “inherently resistant to computational decryption — even by quantum machines,” according to SlimeMoldCrypt inventor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stephanierentschler.com/speculative-design-projects" target="_blank">Stephanie Rentschler</a> (h/t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hackster.io/news/a-mold-powered-encryption-engine-41b49d6f2207">Hackster.io</a>).</p><div class="inlinegallery

Rentschler indicates that its “ever-changing network of tendrils” can form the seed to appealingly unpredictable encryption keys. This sounds like a reasonable proposition, with strong parallels to the aforementioned Cloudflare technology. However, and probably because this is an Arts university project, SlimeMoldCrypt has an added emotional element…</p><h2 id="cultivate-a-tamagochi-like-emotional-attachment-to-your-slime-2">Cultivate a Tamagochi-like emotional attachment to your slime</h2><p>When using a SlimeMoldCrypt device, the operator must tend and care for the mold to keep their encryption healthy, suggests the inventor. “Your encryption strength is tied directly to your care: by managing three environmental controls, light, humidity, and nourishment, you influence the slime mold’s vitality,” says Rentschler. “The more attentively you engage, the more vibrant its cellular movement becomes, enhancing the entropy of your encryption.”</p><p>This process seems very digital-pet-like, going by my limited knowledge of such toys. And, like Tamagotchis, it is possible to kill your actually living slime mold friend(s) by not caring for it adequately. “Neglect weakens the system. If the slime mold’s activity ceases, so does your protection, exposing your information entirely,” explains the University of Applied Arts Vienna's cultured designer and researcher.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

<![CDATA[ Intel reportedly raising prices on ever-popular Raptor Lake chips — 'outdated' CPUs to get over 10% price hike due to disinterest in AI processors ]]>
<p>A new report claims that Intel is set to increase the price of its older Raptor Lake chips by as much as 10% in the face of the continued popularity of the lineup and customers shunning AI-equipped Lunar Lake models, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250925PD210/intel-pc-supply-chain-demand-ai-pc.html"><em>Digitimes. </em></a>While the report doesn't specify which models are set for an increase, it specifically highlights that chips launched in October 2022 (13th-gen chips), noting that prices will increase from $150-160 to $170-$180. This could encompass some popular i3 or i5 models, depending on the region and availability.</p><p>This increase will occur despite the company announcing that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/intel-drops-day-zero-game-driver-support-for-chips-released-last-year-last-gen-igpus-on-14th-gen-core-and-older-cpus-already-put-on-the-backburner-of-legacy-software-support" target="_blank">integrated GPU drivers for these processors will be placed on legacy software support</a>, effectively putting them on the back burner, despite some having launched as recently as 2023. <em>Digitimes</em> cites industry insiders who say "lukewarm" consumer response to AI PCs as a factor.</p><p>Intel's current crop of processors hasn't performed well in the market, with CEO Lip-Bu Tan commenting frankly that the chips aren't competitive in the market. That, coupled with customers seeking value options, has led many to opt for lower-cost previous-generation models instead.</p><p>The Raptor-Lake price jump aligns with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/ddr4-costs-soar-as-manufacturers-pull-the-plug" target="_blank">soaring costs of DDR4 memory chips</a>, meaning PC makers will be hard-pressed to keep their prices low by opting to use the older memory in lieu of newer, faster DDR5, thereby squeezing the budget end of the PC building market. According to the report, some brands are even experiencing supply shortages, especially as the volatility of chip pricing is making them reluctant to place long-term orders. Due to this, PC and component prices may increase slightly as we approach the end of 2025.</p><p>Windows 10’s end-of-life this coming October might result in some corporate sales, especially for companies unwilling to pay for extended support. However, this is less of a concern for consumers, meaning it’s unlikely that retail sales will increase as a result. The upcoming holiday season may drive some sales figures, especially if companies release great deals.</p><p>We've pinged Intel for comment and will update as neccesary.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Intel taps Apple for potential investment, says report — companies said to be discussing ways to work together more closely ]]>
<p>Intel is in preliminary discussions with Apple regarding a potential investment, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-24/intel-is-seeking-an-investment-from-apple-as-part-of-its-comeback-bid" target="_blank">Bloomberg,</a> which cites sources familiar with the matter. The two companies are also reportedly exploring ways to work more closely together, although it remains to be seen whether any potential deals can be reached, as negotiations are in the early stages and may not come to fruition.</p><p>The reported talks with Apple follow a string of recent deals, including major funding from Nvidia and SoftBank, and conversion of CHIPS Act funding from the U.S. government to equity. These moves are believed to be a part of the company's revival strategy that not only includes securing money, but also securing commitments to use the company's products and services going forward to justify developing Intel's next-generation 14A process technology and building production capacities that will support the node.</p><p>Apple used Intel's CPUs inside its PCs from 2005 to 2020, but it never used the company's low-power processors for its iPhones or iPads. Instead, it switched its Macs to Arm-based SoCs in 2020. Apple's current computers do not use any hardware from Intel, even though these systems use technologies originally developed by Intel or co-developed with Intel, including DisplayPort, NVMe, PCIe, Thunderbolt, and USB. Even Thunderbolt 5 controllers/retimers found in the latest MacBook Pro come from Apple, yet are certified by Intel. It is unknown how Apple and Intel could collaborate going forward, though the high-tech world is very convoluted.</p><p>Intel's timing to enter negotiations with Apple seems favourable as the high-tech giant has just received investments from Nvidia, SoftBank, and the U.S. government. Such high-profile backers reflect a growing belief in Intel's comeback, so it should be easier for the company to persuade Apple and other potential investors to buy Intel stock. Also, Apple has prioritized expanding its investments within the U.S., even though much of its supply chain remains abroad. In August, it pledged $600 billion toward domestic initiatives, an increase from a previous $500 billion commitment.</p><p>Obviously, a deal with Apple would further underscore confidence in Intel's direction, which would carry symbolic weight and bolster Intel's public image. However, if the rumored deal does not yield any agreement, this might harm Intel's position.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Raspberry Pi 500+ Review: RGB clicky keys and NVMe storage, but with a $200 price tag ]]>
<p>Raspberry Pi has been a bit quiet after a packed 2024, which saw multiple products and SKUs released on a weekly basis. The Raspberry Pi 500 was one of those products, and it received an Editor’s Choice award despite the omission of a PCIe-based storage. Yes, there was space, and yes, the silkscreen had the layout for it, but it was never added to the 500. This led to other Pi community members and me theorizing that a future model would feature PCIe-based storage. It turns out that we were correct, and here we have the Raspberry Pi 500+.</p><p>Straight off the mark, the price is $200 (approximately £180). The price of a low-spec laptop, essentially. For the price, we get the same System on Chip (SoC) as the Raspberry Pi 500 and Pi 5, but we also get 16GB of RAM and a 256GB NVMe SSD, not to mention a mechanical keyboard. If you want the Raspberry Pi 500+ as part of a getting started kit, then for $220 (£200) you can pick up the Raspberry Pi 500+ Desktop Kit which comes with a branded mouse, USB-C power supply, official HDMI cable and the Raspberry Pi Beginner's Guide. For the review, I have just the Raspberry Pi 500+.</p><p>Is the Raspberry Pi 500+ worth $200, and does it warrant an upgrade over the original Pi 500?

It looks stunning, and the layout is similar to my daily driver, a Keychron K2. Under the keycaps, we have Gateron Blue KS-33 low-profile switches, and as a lover of clicky keys, they please me greatly. This is a keyboard that I could use as a daily driver. Perhaps Raspberry Pi will release the keyboard as a replacement for the official keyboard? Aside from the keyboard, the ports on the rear of the 500+ are identical to those on the 500.</p><p>The Pi 500+ and the 500 before it sport the same all-white color scheme, which is boring, but functional. It looks great on your desk, but I loved the Raspberry Pi 400's "raspberry and white" aesthetic.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The bottom part of the chassis is deeper, and the keyboard is longer. The height is most likely to accommodate space for the NVMe SSD, as the key switches are all located in the top section of the chassis. The length difference will be for the standard keycaps used. Yes, you can replace the keycaps if you wish. Using the included key puller, I pulled a few keys off to take a look underneath, then I threw some spare keys from my Keychron spares box on there to prove that they fit.</p><p>My pre-release unit has a quirk with the ENTER key, and Raspberry Pi assures me that this issue is not present in mass-produced units. Did I mention that the keys are RGB? Oh yes, a rainbow at your fingertips. Just press the FN and the light key to change the sequence. There are static colors (white and red), animated rainbow effects, reactive keys that shine blue or red, and an off option. The power button, a dedicated soft key introduced on the Raspberry Pi 5 and Pi 500 (the secondary function of F10 for the Pi 400), shines green when the Pi is on and red when in standby. To control the RGB LEDs, Raspberry Pi has released a config tool in the form of a Debian package, which handles all installation tasks for demos and the all-important udev rules.</p><p>The package is both a command-line tool and a Python module, which means that we can write our own code to control the LEDs. So I did, and made my usual “Disco” demo.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHKmEbc6CcM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>After a few bouts of trial and error, I managed my goal and I had something like a 1970s disco on my keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

500+ is no exception. It has to be because we need access to the NVMe SSD. You may never upgrade the drive, but the 500+ introduces Phillips screws that secure the bottom chassis to the keyboard. The final retail kit that I received came with a spudger to leverage the plastic chassis apart. Starting at the opening just below the space bar, I slid the spudger around the seam and the clips popped open.</p><p>Initially, I could see two sections of the chassis. The bottom part contained the mainboard, which is covered by a large aluminum heatsink, with only a cutout for the NVMe SSD (note that my pre-release model has a smaller 2230 SSD than what will be included in the retail units). The other part is the custom keyboard plate, which is powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico’s RP2 (RP2040) and not the newer RP2350. There is no need for the newer board, after all, the RP2040 is merely acting as a USB interface.</p><p>Also present on the mainboard is a battery connector for a real-time clock, which can be purchased separately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The only key differences on the Pi 500+ are the NVMe and moving the keyboard connector from a larger flat flex cable (FFC) to a smaller one. The RP2 is not next to the keyboard connector; instead, it is located on the keyboard PCB, which leads me to believe that RP2 performs keyboard and RGB light control.</p><p>The change from a larger to smaller FFC between these versions means that while the mainboard has the same cut-outs and screw holes, you couldn’t transplant the Pi 500+ into a 500 chassis (and vice versa) without some FFC connector and RP2040 desoldering. Of course, the Internet will prove me wrong, and some enterprising maker will do this just for the heck of it.

Again, not super speedy, but for an SBC (Single Board Computer), we will take every extra we can get.</p><p>For all of you eager to know how fast the Raspberry Pi 500+ boots, well, the results are a little disappointing because booting from NVMe took 22.62 seconds, but a Raspberry Pi 500, booting from an A2/SDR104 compatible micro SD card, took just 16.36 seconds. Both Pis are running the latest firmware and bootloader. I also set the Pi 500+ to boot from NVMe first.

In fact, it is the same unit as on the Raspberry Pi 500, but the key selling point of the Pi 500+ is NVMe storage. You could feasibly remove the NVMe SSD and replace it with an AI processing unit, booting the OS from micro SD instead.

But for the 00 series units, the GPIO is horizontal, and that means to use a HAT, or for a clearer view of the GPIO, you will need a right-angled breakout board. There are boards such as Pimoroni’s Flat HAT Hacker, which are cheap and easy to use. If you want to use the GPIO in a project, you will need a breakout. However, in truth, the 00 series of Raspberry Pi is not really for hardware hackers. If you want to build a project around a Pi, go for the “typical” Raspberry Pi form factor found in the Pi 4 / 5.</p><p>I did a test with my own Flat HAT Hacker board, and I can confirm that you can use the GPIO quite easily for basic electronics. If you want to use a HAT, then it may or may not work, as with the introduction of the Raspberry Pi 5,
there were changes to how the GPIO is accessed. Now it is accessed via the RP1 “Southbridge” chip instead of the older means of directly accessing it via the CPU and some hacky (but ultimately working) code modules.</p><p>I then broke out a Pimoroni Explorer HAT Pro, the same board that I used to teach robotics with at Picademy. This still doesn’t work with the Raspberry Pi 5 series of boards, well, unless you go through multiple hoops and spend an afternoon trying to install it. This aspect of the Raspberry Pi experience still makes me sad, and I long for the days when I could just buy a HAT, drop it on my Pi, and start hacking.</p><h2 id="use-cases-for-the-raspberry-pi-500-2">Use Cases for the Raspberry Pi 500+</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

For educational purposes, it would make a suitable classroom PC.</p><p>I was eager to compare the price of a similar Raspberry Pi 5 16GB, the new M.2 compact HAT and the same 256GB NVMe SSD, so I went over to Adafruit and priced it all up.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Well, it shows that in both cases, going the official Raspberry Pi route will cost largely the same, but with the Pi 500+ we have it all contained in a gorgeous looking keyboard. What we lose in function (camera and display access, awkward GPIO) we gain in the form of a singular unit with a great keyboard. But, the Raspberry Pi 500+, like the 500 and 400 before it, is not a platform for electronics / robotics tinkerers. For those enthusiasts, you will need the original form factor Raspberry Pi.</p><p>For those of us that grew up during the home computer boom of the 1970s and 1980s, of which I am one, the form factor is nostalgic, and I can see some enthusiasts building their own home computer emulation systems using the Pi 500+, but, they could also do that with the $90 Raspberry Pi 500, or even the older Raspberry Pi 400.

<![CDATA[ Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme and Elite chips for PCs stretch up to a record 5 GHz — 3nm Arm chips sport new Oryon Prime cores ]]>
<p>Qualcomm is back for round two of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/qualcomm-claims-it-owns-10-percent-of-u-s-windows-pc-retail-market-for-devices-priced-usd800-and-up"><u>its push into Windows PCs</u></a>. At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, the company revealed its Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme. These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors.</p><p>The Elite Extreme is a new tier above the standard Elite, which was the top chip in the original X-series line. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme will offer up to 18 cores, and Qualcomm claims it's the first Arm chip to hit 5 GHz (on up to two cores).</p><p>The company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. The Snapdragon X2 Elite uses a mix of Qualcomm Oryon Prime cores and what it calls Performance CPU cores. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. We don't yet have benchmarks to share, and Qualcomm didn't note the exact TDPs for these chips.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is model X2E-96-100, while the standard Elites are X2E-88-100 and X2E-80-100. The Extreme and the 88-100 each have 18 cores, while the 80-100 has 12 cores.</p><p>There's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. The new 80 TOPS NPU looks to be the fastest in a laptop (with INT8 math), with 78% more TOPS than the previous generation, 45 TOPS NPU. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that
this NPU "is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences." (Copilot+ doesn't include actual Copilot, the assistant that runs largely in the cloud.)</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th

<![CDATA[ Alibaba announces partnership with Nvidia despite Beijing’s bans — Chinese e-commerce giant is prioritizing AI with plans for global expansion ]]>
<p>Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba announced that it’s partnering with Nvidia to fuel its data center expansion across the globe and the introduction of new AI products. Reuters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/alibaba-launches-qwen3-max-ai-model-with-more-than-trillion-parameters-2025-09-24">reports</a> that the company is now prioritizing artificial intelligence as part of its core business, which will put it on par with the company’s online retail and wholesale business that made it the tech giant it is today. The announcement seems to imply a direct contravention of Beijing’s directive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/china-bans-its-biggest-tech-companies-from-acquiring-nvidia-chips-says-report-beijing-claims-its-homegrown-ai-processors-now-match-h20-and-rtx-pro-6000d">that bans its biggest tech companies from acquiring Nvidia chips</a>, so it’s unclear if this partnership includes the purchase of AI GPUs.<br><br>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/press-room/alibaba-cloud-announces-international-expansion-pi?_p_lc=1">Alibaba Cloud</a>, the company’s Platform for AI (PAI) will integrate the “full suite of the Nvidia Physical AI software stack," so it technically may not violate the order to buy homegrown AI processors. The company already reportedly has its AI chip that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/alibaba-ai-chip-goes-head-to-head-with-nvidia-h20">competes with Nvidia’s own H20,</a> and it has even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/alibaba-cloud-ditches-nvidias-interconnect-in-favor-of-ethernet-tech-giant-uses-own-high-performance-network-to-connect-15000-gpus-inside-data-center">created its own High Performance Network using Ethernet</a> to replace Nvidia's interconnect technology.<br><br>However, it seems that Alibaba is ready to work with Nvidia to create a cloud-based system design to advance AI capabilities in real-world applications. “The speed of AI industry development has far exceeded our expectations, and the industry’s demand for AI infrastructure has also far exceeded our expectations,” said Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu during the annual Aspara Conference. <br><br>Alibaba also unveiled plans to build data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands in the coming year. It will also add more of the same in Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and Dubai — also in the coming year. Alibaba Cloud Intelligence Group SVP Dr. Feifei Li remarked that “AI is revolutionizing not only technology, but also the very foundation of how enterprises deliver business value and drive growth. Our strategic expansion of global infrastructure is designed to cater for the accelerating demand from forward-thinking customers.” But despite all these plans, the company did not mention whether it will use Nvidia’s AI chips for these projects. <br><br>This move to increase Alibaba’s footprint abroad will help the company influence the development of AI technology across the globe.

Of course, its software partnership with Alibaba helps ensure that Nvidia is still involved with this massive project — unless Washington, D.C. or Beijing steps in as part of their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/the-u-s-and-china-are-engaged-in-a-race-over-chip-development-both-countries-are-racing-to-build-infrastructure">chip rivalry</a> and stops the deal from moving forward.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ OpenAI may lease Nvidia GPUs instead of buying them — financial engineering deal could cut hardware costs in pursuit of 10GW buildout ]]>
<p>OpenAI is in advanced talks to lease high-performance GPUs from Nvidia, rather than purchase them outright, as part of its plan to build out custom AI data centers over the next several years. That’s according to a report published September 23 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-megadeal-nvidia-discusses-new-business-model-chip-leasing" target="_blank"><em>The Information</em></a>, which cites multiple people familiar with negotiations between the two companies.</p><p>The proposed leasing deal, which is reportedly still under discussion and subject to change, would represent a shift in how AI infrastructure is financed. Instead of buying hardware upfront or renting it from cloud providers like Microsoft or Oracle, OpenAI would take possession of Nvidia’s AI chips under a five-year lease, potentially reducing capital strain while offloading depreciation risk to the supplier. Sources close to the discussions say OpenAI estimates that the leasing arrangement could cut its total hardware costs by 10 to 15%, although the methodology behind that figure is unclear.</p><p>The talks are part of a broader <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-and-openai-forge-usd100-billion-alliance-to-deliver-10-gigawatts-of-nvidia-hardware-for-ai-datacenters">$100 billion strategic partnership between OpenAI and Nvidia</a>, announced on September 22. Under the agreement, OpenAI plans to deploy up to 10 GW of Nvidia-powered infrastructure, with Nvidia providing both financial backing and hardware expertise. Nvidia is also investing $10 billion in OpenAI for a roughly 2% equity stake at a $500 billion valuation.</p><p>According to<em> The Information</em>, Nvidia could consider setting up a dedicated financing vehicle to fund the leasing structure. That entity would borrow capital to purchase GPUs and networking hardware, using the chips themselves as collateral. OpenAI’s lease payments would then service the loan over the duration of the five-year term.</p><p>OpenAI, despite its valuation and revenue potential, lacks the balance sheet to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars in hardware on its own. Its projected cash burn through 2029 is pegged at $115 billion, and previous estimates suggest OpenAI could spend $450 billion renting capacity through 2030. Direct leasing would give it more control over site selection, layout, and workload optimization, all while securing long-term access to Nvidia’s next-generation accelerators.</p><p>The deal, if finalized, could have ripple effects far beyond OpenAI. A large-scale leasing model could alter how Nvidia allocates inventory, how quickly it phases in new architectures, and how competitors position their own AI silicon.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Manic Steam game collector first to surpass 40,000 game titles in library — $640,000 digital collection took 15 years to build ]]>
<p>It is notoriously easy to own more games than you have time to play on Steam. However, a Steam gamer in China has taken this phenomenon to the extreme. On Tuesday, SonixLegend became the first person to gain a Steam ‘Game Collector’ badge for owning 40,000 games. Obviously still on the lookout for their next favorite title, the needle has moved up to 40,031 at the time of writing, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://steamdb.info/badge/13/">SteamDB</a> (h/t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polygon.com/steam-achievements-game-collector-40000-sonixlegend-worth/" target="_blank">Polygon</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure

This particular user has been building up their game collection on Steam for over 15 years.</p><p>Imagine all the payments processing, code copying and pasting, and agreeing to T&Cs time that would be required to hoard 40,000 Steam games. If SonixLegend could go through these steps in a swift minute per game, they would need a full month (with no rest) to add 40,000 games to a library. If ‘working’ 8-hour days on this endeavor, you’d be looking at three solid months of your life taken up to build this library.</p><p>As for actually playing through that enormous collection, Polygon estimates that it would take SonixLegend “seven years of non-stop playtime” to work through and get value out of this enormous game collection. Again, at a more ‘reasonable’ 8 hours per day, you’d have to triple that timescale. Underlining the fact that SonixLegend is a ‘normal’ gamer, though (not a bot or some such), are stats that show they are really keen on some of the games in their collection. <em>Alien Swarm</em> (released 2010) has been played through for over 550 hours. Moreover, 35 other titles have been completed ‘perfectly.’</p><p>Two other SonixLegend stats stand out, which must make them a certified Steam-nut. First, we must highlight the potential cost of building this collection. According to SteamDB, the huge digital collection is worth nearly $640,000 at today’s prices, but SonixLegend must follow the sales, as they seem to have spent ‘just’ $248,810 on these digital goodies. Secondly, this Steam Devotee “technically owns over 97,000 titles in their account,” notes Polygon, but apparently Valve doesn’t count its PC games store's ‘shovelware.’</p><p>Despite the humongous state of their collection, we are sure SonixLegend is still looking forward to the next Steam Sale…</p><figure class="van-image-figure

In second place in this leaderboard, Ian Brandon Anderson owned 39,502 Steam games. In third, we see ikun with 36,660 titles, and all members of the top-10 club have at least 33,000 games in their burgeoning libraries. Even to crack the top 100 of this leaderboard, you will need at least 19,000 games, at the time of writing.</p><p>My Steam PC collection expands to 135 games, which I thought was a lot. But I also own a few more titles on Epic, Ubisoft, and other platforms.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Silicon Motion is back, and it’s not content to sit on its laurels after the amazing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/silicon-motion-sm2508-ssd-review"><u>SM2508 launch</u></a>. It’s here to take the fight to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e31t-es-2tb-review"><u>Phison's E31T</u></a> in the mid-grade PCIe 5.0 SSD segment with its new SM2504XT SSD controller, and it isn’t pulling any punches. We took the new SSD for a spin on an electronic sample (ES) platform to assess its performance.</p><p>The combination of high performance, 10+ GB/s transfers, and excellent power efficiency makes the SM2504XT ES a pretty sweet solution. The SM2508 gave us our first feeling of a real next-gen drive, and the SM2504XT is the less-expensive but no less successful follow-up.</p><p>While high-end, eight-channel, DRAM-equipped drives are the way to go for enthusiasts, not all SSDs have to be the pinnacle of perfection. Dropping DRAM and some bandwidth can create a better solution for laptops, mobile devices, and small-form-factor desktops. These drives pull less electricity but are still very powerful in their own right. The only real downside might be the capacity limitation. These drives are also kind of an odd pick if you’re putting them into a PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot because of the added cost over last-generation alternatives, but in time, the newer hardware will make that decision easier. After all, almost nobody buys PCIe 3.0 drives anymore.</p><p>After some time with the drive, we can’t help but feel impressed by what SMI has managed to do here and with the SM2508. Competition is a good thing, and SMI has come better prepared this time around. Waiting for 6nm technology was in some ways a wise decision as PCIe 5.0 is still in the process of growing its user base. We certainly think more efficient drives are the way to go either way, even if the impact is relatively small for most PCs. Less power means less heat, and heat is the enemy of hardware.</p><p>The SM2504XT ES just <em>feels</em> like a next-gen drive – we got the same feeling in our SM2508 preview – and we have no trouble embracing this kind of progress.</p><h2 id="smi-sm2504xt-es-specifications-2">SMI SM2504XT ES Specifications</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Product</p></th><th

The controller can reach up to 11,500 / 11,000 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,700K / 2,000K random read and write IOPS. This is roughly on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e31t-es-2tb-review"><u>Phison E31T controller</u></a>, used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/corsair-mp700-elite-ssd-review"><u>Corsair MP700 Elite</u></a> and several other drives. We would give the peak performance edge to the SM2504XT, though.</p><p>The controller does support the TCG Opal 2.0 specification, so drives based on it could optionally support hardware encryption. We expect a normal warranty of five years with 600TB of write endurance per TB of capacity, or more.</p><h2 id="smi-sm2504xt-es-software-and-accessories-2">SMI SM2504XT ES Software and Accessories</h2><p>The ES itself doesn’t come with any software, but third-party partners will offer their own solutions.

It’s only using one NAND flash package for 2TB, which suggests a sixteen-die package (16DP) if it’s using standard 1Tb dies. This is interesting as the drive could be sold in a shorter form factor, and it can handle at least 4TB of capacity in single-sided form factors. We cannot show or directly discuss the flash for confidential reasons, although we have some suspicions as to why.</p><p>The same policy was true for our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/silicon-motion-sm2508-ssd-review"><u>SMI SM2508 preview,</u></a> and, at the end of the day, it didn’t make much difference. The SM2508 ES used BiCS6, whereas release drives now use superior BiCS8 and 232- or 276-layer Micron TLC flash; the retail drives performed better, if anything. On the other hand, it’s likely that the flash on the SM2504XT is contemporary, so our results with this ES should be closer to what we’ll see in retail.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The E28 was initially listed as 7nm but is actually 6nm, so things can change. In either case, the node enables it to be very efficient. It’s DRAM-less with four flash channels at up to 3,600 MT/s, which, with overhead, puts a cap around 11.5 GB/s. Each channel has four chip enable signals, totaling 16, which means 32 dies should be possible. However, with current flash, this limit is reached at 4TB. However, we wouldn’t be surprised if 2TB were a more common maximum point for third parties.</p><p>Future 2Tb dies could double the maximum to 8TB, which might help 4TB become more common; however, that’s also somewhat deceptive. QLC flash is likely to see such implementation first, but enterprise demand has kept it from being affordable in the consumer space. 2Tb TLC yields may be lower at first, especially for dense die packages. So we would advise managing your expectations if you’re hoping for a lot of capacity with this controller in the near term.</p><p>The controller is built with a triple-core Arm Cortex-R8 processor, which means a lot of power, delivering up to 2 million IOPS. This was unthinkable for a “budget” drive not that long ago, although real-world benefits are only derivative of this. More IOPS can mean reduced latency, for one, which is downstream of newer flash with higher I/O speeds. Faster flash also increases bandwidth, which can bring improvements even at lower, more realistic queue depths, such as you find with file transfers. Therefore, it’s important to put this power into context – it’s a shortcut method of classifying the drive in comparison to what came before.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p><h2 id="comparison-products-2">Comparison Products</h2><p>The SMI SM2504T ES’s top competitors are E31T-based drives with the newest flash: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/the-crucial-p510-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P510</u></a>, with Micron’s newest TLC, and the Kioxia Exceria Plus G4 with BiCS8 TLC.

The fact that this drive can even get up to Rocket 5 levels of performance in some areas is incredible. We only see a minor dip at 128KiB for reads, which could be a nuance of the controller or an anomaly. We observe a similar drop with the P510, which may indicate that a similar flash is used on both of these drives.</p><p>Standard CrystalDiskMark sequential performance yields excellent results at both QD1 and QD8. The SM2504XT ES, in fact, beats the X570, which has eight channels, in three out of the four.</p><p>Eight channels still help when you want maximum write throughput, and adding DRAM to the package gets you better results for reads and writes. Just see the Rocket 5. The SM2504XT ES actually appears to be punching above its weight, which helps sell it as a mid-level <em>PCIe 5.0 </em>drive. Usually, you have to give up something to meet its expected price point, but if it can match or beat the X570, then it’s creeping up on being a high-end option in its own right. It’s only held back by having a weaker capacity potential.</p><p>Calling it high-end would be a less persuasive argument if the drive had poor 4K latency; however, the SM2504XT ES has excellent read latency and good write latency at low queue depths. It’s effectively a match for BiCS8 or 232-Layer Micron TLC flash – see the Exceria Plus G4 and 980 Blade, respectively – with reads and writes on par with older high-end drives, such as the Rocket 5 and KC3000. It also beats the X570 by a little bit. Write performance isn’t quite as important, so that is a good place for some compromise, especially as it still matches some very capable drives.</p><h2 id="sustained-write-performance-and-cache-recovery-2">Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery</h2><p>Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache, which is a fast area of pseudo-SLC (single-bit) programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the "native" TLC (three-bit) or QLC (four-bit) flash. Performance can suffer even more if the drive is forced to fold, which is the process of migrating data out of the cache in order to free up space for further incoming data.</p><p>We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds. This process shows the performance of the drive in various states as well as the steady state write performance.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The cache is a little over 230GB, which is a good size: it’s not too large and not too small. This allows the drive to maintain almost 2.1 GB/s when in native TLC mode, which is quite good. After some time, the drive is able to recover some of the cache and can reach a higher average steady-state write speed of 2,545 MB/s, which is good for a four-channel controller. This drive would be a fine choice in an external enclosure all the way up to Thunderbolt 4, if you are so inclined.</p><p>One could look at the P510 and point out that it has a similar TLC speed but achieves a significantly higher steady state. This isn’t surprising as the P510’s cache is small in comparison. We think it’s possible that Crucial opted for a more conservative cache in the P510 after receiving feedback on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-2tb-t500-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>T500</u></a>, an excellent drive that had some issues with sustained writes, even after a later firmware update.</p><p>If the P510 happens to use the same flash as the SM2504XT ES, then the speed difference won’t matter for some applications – if you’re limited by an enclosure’s interface even up to USB4 40Gbps speeds, for instance – but in desktop use, the P510 could be better for some niche applications. To put it more simply, both drives have consistent write performance, but they are tuned slightly differently.</p><h2 id="power-consumption-and-temperature-2">Power Consumption and Temperature</h2><p>We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider, especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ultrabooks-premium-laptops"><u>best ultrabooks</u></a> can have mediocre stock storage. Desktops may be more performance-oriented with less support for power-saving features, so we show the worst-case.</p><p>Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt, or efficiency, is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload, but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly, ultimately saving energy.</p><div class="inlinegallery

The Exceria Plus G4 and P510 use the same controller as each other, but the former has BiCS8 flash instead of Micron’s flash, which makes us favor the former drive for power efficiency. Kioxia historically does a good job of refining its firmware, but we still think it’s the BiCS8 doing the lifting in this case. The SM2504XT is a different controller, and we don’t have much information on it with regard to efficiency. We would assume it’s equal to or probably better than the E31T, but we can’t be sure without knowing the flash for certain.</p><p>Our guess is that the SM2504XT is more efficient given SMI’s architecture, and there are some clues to support this conclusion. The first is that the Exceria Plus G4 has lower max power consumption, while the P510 has more, which suggests the SM2504XT ES might be using less-efficient flash than BiCS8. Coupled with the relatively good idle power consumption – remember, we’re testing under the worst-case scenario – in which the SM2504XT outperforms both the Exceria Plus G4 and P510, those two being tied, the implication is that the ES’s controller consumes less power than the E31T. This also provides us with another hint about what flash is being used, but given this is an ES, we won’t risk making a firm conclusion. We’ll have to wait for retail drives and firmware to do that. Instead, we’ll just say that this drive would be fantastic for laptops, portable devices, and HTPCs in any configuration.</p><h2 id="test-bench-and-testing-notes-2">Test Bench and Testing Notes</h2><div ><table><caption>Test Bench and Testing Notes</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>CPU</strong></p></td><td

Each SSD is prefilled to 50% capacity and tested as a secondary device. Unless noted, we use active cooling for all SSDs.</p><h2 id="smi-sm2504xt-es-bottom-line-2">SMI SM2504XT ES Bottom Line</h2><p>The SMI SM2504XT is an excellent drive with solid all-around performance, good sustained write performance, and excellent power efficiency. We can’t give it a higher score for a couple of reasons, though. The first is that this is just an engineering sample, and we need to see retail drives to fully give it our endorsement. Part of that is because we don’t know where these drives will be priced, although we would expect them to land close to E31T-based drives like the Crucial P510. We also don’t know what capacities we’ll see, although matching the E31T shouldn’t be difficult.</p><p>Second, we would like to see drives using the SM2504XT compared with different flash. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter too much for subjective performance – these drives are insanely fast by any consumer measure – but it would be nice to have different implementations, including cache configurations, to make some drives more interesting. The P510, for one, has a unique caching scheme that makes us like it a lot for use in faster external enclosures. The Exceria Plus G4, on the other hand, utilizes BiCS8 TLC flash, making it more efficient than the P510. If SM2504XT-based drives can have a similar variance, then we would definitely consider this controller a winner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Four channels and these I/O speeds, which are reasonable if you want to maintain high power efficiency, are not enough to fully saturate PCIe 5.0. That’s fine, but it also means this drive will never be a 5/5, especially since there’s no DRAM. That doesn’t make it a bad drive, just not the fastest.</p><p>The channel count also reduces the maximum capacity, which is one place where a drive like the Biwin X570 – or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/acer-predator-gm9000-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Acer Predator GM9000</u></a> – can beat it. That said, we think this solution is fantastic for mobile platforms and laptops, although most of those devices are still relegated to PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots. That’s fine, as this drive would be even more efficient there, but you’re paying more for less overall benefit.</p><p>What we can say for sure is that the SM2504XT SSD controller and platform is very exciting, even though Phison beat SMI to the punch with its E31T. There’s room for both, as laptop sales always trump desktops, but we think budget-seekers will stick with PCIe 4.0 drives for now. SMI did beat Phison to the high-end game with the SM2508 controller, which is also very efficient, and we’re glad that the company is being competitive again. We don’t see anything we don’t like in the SM2504XT ES, and if the launch is smooth, then we’ll be back with further solid scores.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p>

<![CDATA[ AMD keeps AM4 platform on life support with 2020-era Zen 3 CPU — Ryzen 3 5100 surfaces, nine years after AM4 launch ]]>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ryzen-3-5100-budget-cpu-could-excel-on-the-retail-market">Ryzen 3 5100</a> is among the processors known to exist but not previously observed in person. That situation has now changed, as hardware leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1970832338692292736">momomo_us </a>has shared a photograph confirming the existence of the Ryzen 3 5100, which was previously regarded as a unicorn in hardware circles.</p><p>The quad-core processor with simultaneous multithreading (SMT) originates from AMD's long-gone Zen 3 days, specifically from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-5000g-cezanne-apus-oems-now-coming-to-diy-later-this-year">Ryzen 5000G</a> series (codenamed Cezanne). Typically, these Cezanne series chips are equipped with Vega graphics; however, the Ryzen 3 5100, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cezanne-lives-on-ryzen-7-5700-surfaces-without-integrated-graphics">Ryzen 7 5700</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-5600-and-ryzen-5-5500-review">Ryzen 5 5500</a>, belongs to a distinctive subset that does not include integrated graphics. This absence is evidenced by the processor model names, which lack the "G" suffix.</p><p>As depicted in the photograph, the Ryzen 3 5100 possesses an Ordering Part Number (OPN) code of 100-00000456, which appears somewhat fictitious as it is not readily available in any known sources. AMD does not list the Ryzen 3 5100 on its official website, although occasional references to OEM components can sometimes be found there. The copyright year associated with the Ryzen 3 5100 is 2020, suggesting that the initial production of the chip commenced in that year. This timeframe is consistent with the Cezanne series.</p><p>Confusion frequently arises regarding the Ryzen 5000G series and the primary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-release-date-specifications-pricing-benchmarks-all-we-know">Ryzen 5000</a> (codenamed Vermeer) series, due to AMD's similar branding for both series. Certain SKUs within the Vermeer lineup, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-5-5600-and-ryzen-5-5500-review">Ryzen 5 5600</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-brings-ryzen-9-5900-and-ryzen-7-5800-to-oems">Ryzen 7 5800</a>, lack a suffix, which may lead to misunderstandings, such as perceiving the Ryzen 3 5100 as a Vermeer processor. Although Cezanne and Vermeer share similarities, including the use of Zen 3 execution cores and the AM4 socket, they are inherently different. Cezanne employs a monolithic design, whereas Vermeer utilizes AMD's chiplet architecture.</p><p>According to listings from motherboard manufacturers, the Ryzen 3 5100 is confirmed to feature the monolithic Cezanne die. The Ryzen 3 5100 serves as the direct successor to the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-4-4500-ryzen-3-4100-cpu-review">Ryzen 3 4100</a> (codenamed Renoir). The enhancements encompass a transition to the Zen 3 core architecture, an increase of 200 MHz in boost clock speed, and a doubling of the L3 cache size. Alternatively, from another perspective, the Ryzen 3 5100 can be regarded as an underclocked variant of the Ryzen 3 5300G, distinguished by a 200 MHz lower base clock and the absence of integrated graphics.</p><p>The Ryzen 3 5100 is an OEM processor, which largely explains why it took so long for it to smile for the camera. However, make no mistake, the Zen 3-powered chip has likely been available for purchase in China for some time now. With sufficient knowledge of where to search, one can almost invariably locate various items in China, including unreleased hardware, engineering samples of upcoming processors, or OEM components.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Check that you're ready for invasive DRM with new feature built right into Steam — Secure Boot and TPM status now listed right in the app ]]>
<p>Ever since the release of Windows 11, if you're a PC gamer, you've definitely heard the term "Secure Boot." It's required to play a myriad of different games these days — mainly competitive shooters — and serves as one part of the two-punch security knockout consisting of TPM and Secure Boot. These features help keep your system protected from bad actors, and now Valve has just made it super convenient to check whether you're ahead of the curve. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053?emclan=103582791433918461&emgid=545621427784515586" target="_blank">In the latest Steam beta</a>, you can easily see your Secure Boot status in the settings.</p><p>If you open Steam and go to "Help" in the menu bar and click on "System Information," you'll be bombarded with a bunch of stats about your PC. Just scroll down till you see the "Operating System" heading, and you should see a list item for Secure Boot, telling you if it's enabled. This makes it easier for gamers who get inundated with information to ensure they're not excluded. While you're there, you'll see your TPM status as well, which is the other big security feature of Windows 11 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/bypass-windows-11-tpm-requirement" target="_blank">requirement for (official) compatibility with the OS</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It works hand-in-hand with Secure Boot to check if anything has changed since the last known good boot. It does that by recording hashes at each stage of every boot run to tally against, which is just one secret, along with many others (like BitLocker encryption keys) that are stored away in this chip. TPM is a requirement in most modern online games, just like Secure Boot.</p><p>Secure Boot works to ensure that only trusted, signed software runs when your PC starts, in an effort to sift out any shady programs. It's a kernel-level security feature, so it enjoys the highest level of privilege on your system — something that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/motherboards/new-uefi-vulnerability-bypasses-secure-boot-bootkits-stay-undetected-even-after-os-re-install?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">critics often point toward as a vulnerability</a>. Secure Boot, in essence, is a novel concept and is designed to do what it says: make your boot secure, but sometimes the amount of access it has can raise questions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Without Secure Boot (and often TPM), some games won't even launch, so it's important to enable it if you see it turned off in Steam.

Valve has just added the ability to check your Secure Boot and TPM status in the latest Steam beta update.

<![CDATA[ Microsoft develops breakthrough chip cooling method — microfluidic channels can cut peak temps by up to 65%, outperform conventional cold plates by up to 3x ]]>
<p>As data center-grade processors are getting hotter, companies invent more and more creative ways to cool them down. As Nvidia and its partners are reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/liquid-cooling/immersion-cooling-for-data-centers-an-exotic-inevitability">experimenting with new cold plates and immersion cooling</a> for next-generation AI GPUs, Microsoft is proposing to etch microfluidic channels on the back of an actual chip to reduce its peak temperature by up to 65%, making it three times more efficient than cold plates.</p><p>Microsoft says it has developed a cooling system that routes fluid directly into microchannels etched on the back of the silicon die to guide the coolant to high-heat regions inside the chip. Flowing liquid inside the chip greatly reduces the efficiency of the whole setup, as liquid can almost 'touch' hot spots inside the processor, whereas in the case of more traditional liquid cooling or even immersion cooling, heat emerges several layers away from the coolant.</p><p>To optimize thermal routing, Microsoft worked with Swiss startup Corintis, which used artificial intelligence to refine channel geometry. Rather than simple straight lines, the final layout mimics patterns found in nature, such as leaf veins or butterfly wings, to guide fluid more efficiently. Also, microchannels must be small enough to function effectively but not so deep that they weaken the silicon, risking mechanical failure.</p><p>However, etching microfluid channels can only be done as a separate sequence during chip manufacturing, which means additional steps and costs. Alternatively, Microsoft proposes to produce a microfluidic heat transfer structure separately and cool down one or two chips using the structure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230422435A1/en">according to a patent</a>. Such integration requires new packaging methods to prevent coolant leaks and maintain durability.</p><p>By now, Microsoft has discovered the right coolant fluid, developed precise etching techniques, and managed to integrate these into chip production. Therefore, Microsoft considers its technology ready for full-scale production within Microsoft's chip development pipeline. Third-party customers may license the technology from Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZBwLi3ajYE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"Microfluidics would allow for more power-dense designs that will enable more features that customers care about and give better performance in a smaller amount of space," said Judy Priest, corporate vice president and chief technical officer of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft. "But we needed to prove the technology and the design worked, and then the very next thing I wanted to do was test reliability."</p><p>Microsoft is testing the cooling solution on servers running simulated Teams workloads, where uneven heat loads across many services are handled more efficiently, enabling higher burst performance, which helps to reduce the number of servers that otherwise sit idle when not in use during peak loads that tend to happen on the hour or on the half-hour.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Compared to cold plates, the cooling performance improvement was as much as three times, depending on workload and setup.

<![CDATA[ Solidigm touts industry's first liquid-cooled enterprise SSD — D7-PS1010 is an E.1 PCIe 5.0 drive with a wrap-around cold plate ]]>
<p>Solidigm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.solidigm.com/en-WW/254479-solidigm-introduces-world-s-first-cold-plate-cooled-essd-for-next-generation-fanless-server-designs/" target="_blank">has announced</a> what it calls the industry's first liquid-cooled enterprise SSD, the D7-PS1010, in the blade-like E.1 form factor with a PCIe 5.0 interface. The SSD board is ensconced in a wraparound cold plate, with hose connectors at the ends, making for a hot-swappable design that directly cools the controller and NAND chips.</p><p>The company is pointing this SSD at AI servers with Direct-Attached Storage (DAS, as opposed to using a separate storage). To that effect, Solidigm talks up a partnership with Supermicro, which mentions the E.1S variant of these SSDs is a perfect fit for its Nvidia HGX B300-based servers. The hot-swap design in a compact form factor also helps with maintenance, as conventional liquid-cooled designs can be a bit fiddly whenever they need servicing.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/solidigm-debuts-the-worlds-first-liquid-cooled-essd-solution-aims-to-achieve-fully-fanless-gpu-servers">cooling apparatus</a> of D7-PS1010 can cool both sides of the PCB at once and should make for much-improved thermal efficiency compared to traditional fan-based designs. Solidigm claims this design ought to let designers come up with server layouts that entirely eschew fans in their storage bays, potentially making the rack units smaller than ever.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Both of them use the E1.S form factor, though it's not hard to imagine that at some point, Solidigm will employ this technology in longer E1.L models. Solidigm says it's "working closely" with multiple ODM (Original Device Manufacturers) and OEMs to qualify both available versions for vendor lists.</p><p>The SSD's specs are within the expected range for an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/microns-industry-first-pci-6-0-ssd-promises-sequential-reads-up-to-28-000-mb-s-245-tb-ssd-also-coming-for-those-who-need-capacity-more-than-cutting-edge-speed">enterprise SSD</a> and optimized for read-intensive workloads. The D7-PS1010 clocks in at 14,500 MB/s for sequential reads, and 8,400 MB/s for writes. Read IOPS are predictably impressive at 3,200,000 for random reads and a serviceable 315,000 for writes. As for endurance, Solidigm says the SSDs are good for 1 entire drive write per day (DWPD), or a total of 7 petabytes written. The MTBF is rated for 2.5 million hours, and the company offers a five-year warranty coverage.</p><p>Given the massive power requirements of an AI datacenter, anything that helps with thermal efficiency is most welcome.

Built on Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture, it comes equipped with 10,752 CUDA cores, 84 ray-tracing cores, and 336 tensor cores, along with 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, and a memory bandwidth of 960GB/s.</p><p>The GPU supports the full Blackwell feature set, including DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, enhanced ray tracing capabilities, Reflex 2, Nvidia Broadcast, and more. If we look at the chart below, the RTX 5080 ranks third in regard to the geomean averages for rasterization in our suite of games. In our testing, we found that the GPU delivered only modest gains in traditional rasterized gaming, beating the RTX 4080 Super by only 9% at 4K Ultra settings, and even smaller margins at 1440p and 1080p.</p><div class="inlinegallery

<![CDATA[ AI slop infects PC watercooling with Thermaltake's 'AI Forge' feature — adds generative AI to its MagFloe Ultra AIO screens for custom backgrounds ]]>
<p>A few months ago, Thermaltake <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/liquid-cooling/thermaltakes-new-aio-liquid-cooler-features-a-3-95-inch-lcd-display-and-swappable-reverse-blade-fans">took the covers off its MagFloe Ultra lineup</a> of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers that have a pretty neat-looking display, along with flagship specs. These coolers are controlled by the TT RGB Plus software that has a bunch of built-in animations for the 3.4-inch LCD on the pump. It can not only display images and videos, but also overlays the weather, time, and CPU/GPU telemetry data on top. Unfortunately, these elements are bound by certainty and lack imagination — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techpowerup.com/341283/thermaltake-unveils-ai-forge-new-feature-within-tt-rgb-plus-3-0-software-for-magfloe-ultra-aio-lcd?amp" target="_blank">Thermaltake is here to fix that </a>with its new "AI Forge" feature.</p><p>Yes, your liquid cooler, whose sole job is to keep your CPU temperatures in check, now has AI. Inside the TT RGB Plus 3.0 app, there exists "a studio without walls" that will allow you to generate custom videos and images with your own prompts. The selling point here is that you don't need to fiddle with third-party services; new animations can be made and saved right inside Thermaltake's software, ready to be applied to your cooler's screen. These custom backgrounds can then be overlaid with the aforementioned time, weather, or hardware monitoring data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

It's reasonable to believe this AI model will not run locally and will require an internet connection. Thermaltake did not say whether AI Forge will also work on the TT PlayLink mobile app that can be used to change the screen backgrounds on MagFloe Ultra coolers as well. As far as we can tell, this is the first instance of AI implemented on any PC cooler — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/people-dont-buy-ai-pcs-because-of-ai-report-shows-the-need-for-upgrades-drives-ai-pc-adoption">not that it helps much anywhere else</a>.</p><p>Whether you consider this a genuinely useful feature or just AI slop, the MagFloe Ultra coolers themselves are no gimmick. They come in two variants: 360mm and 420mm, and both are high-performance AIOs with slim radiators, low-noise pumps, and easy installation with pogo-pin connectors. You get 120mm or 140mm ARGB fans with swappable fan blades, along with two years of warranty, which is plenty of time to drive up those tokens in AI Forge.

<![CDATA[ iBuyPower Y40 Pro Review: Style first ]]>
<p>iBuyPower casts a wide net with its desktop lineup, aiming to please everyone from frugal shoppers to hardcore enthusiasts. And while it often delivers, the Y40 Pro, reviewed here ($1,899.99 as tested, on sale for $2,099.99), raises a few eyebrows. Its aquarium-like glass shell and RGB-lit interior certainly make a statement, and the performance appears promising at first glance. But the focus on aesthetics brings compromises that may lead you to look elsewhere.</p><h2 id="design-of-the-ibuypower-y40-pro-2">Design of the iBuyPower Y40 Pro</h2><p>As the Y40 Pro's name suggests, the system is built in Hyte’s Y40 chassis, a more compact, pared-down sibling to the Hyte Y60 found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/ibuypower-y60-gaming-desktop-review"><u>iBuyPower Y60 Pro</u></a>. (Hyte is owned by iBuyPower.) Aesthetics take center stage here. The borderless glass panels on the front and sides evoke a fishtank-like display, offering an unobstructed view of the internals. Its dimensions of 18.58 x 17.28 x 9.44
inches (HDW) are standard mid-tower fare.</p><figure class="van-image-figure
inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a9fTgWjvd4P5btEfjji6HY" name="iBuyPower Y40 Pro - Front" alt="iBuyPower Y40 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a9fTgWjvd4P5btEfjji6HY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tower is equipped with five 120 mm RGB fans: two side intakes, one rear exhaust, and two mounted on its own 240 mm liquid CPU cooler. RGB lighting extends to the cooler’s waterblock and the system’s RAM, creating a cohesive glow throughout the build.</p><p>To manage the lighting, I had to manually install MSI Center. Identifying which fans were mapped to which headers eluded me, but the “Select All” function allowed me to apply settings across all zones simultaneously. That’s slightly disappointing – being able to control individual zones would have allowed more personalization. The RGB DIMMs, however, can be independently controlled.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Side panels are secured with metal ball pins that release with a firm pull, a simple and effective solution. That said, a few design choices feel counterintuitive. The right side panel’s dust filter is molded in, making it non-removable – cleaning it requires removing the entire door. The two bottom filters slide out in opposite directions, meaning you’ll likely need to shift the entire tower if it’s placed near a wall. There’s also a dust filter on the top panel, despite it serving as an exhaust rather than an intake.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Even at idle, the fans remain consistently audible, often rising above ambient household sounds. Thermal management appears poorly tuned, with fan curves reacting aggressively to brief CPU activity spikes. During gaming sessions, noise levels increased noticeably, prompting me to switch to closed-back headphones just to catch subtler in-game sounds. While advanced users can tweak the fan curves in the motherboard BIOS or using an app, this desktop should have come better-tuned out of the box.</p><h2 id="ibuypower-y40-pro-specifications-2">iBuyPower Y40 Pro Specifications</h2><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>CPU</strong></p></td><td

Note that the external antennas shown in the photos must be attached for reliable wireless performance.</p><p>This case’s priority on form over function limits expansion. The vertically mounted GPU obstructs the motherboard’s PCIe slots, ruling out the installation of any additional full-height cards. It’s just something to be aware of when you buy this desktop – most users are not installing additional PCIe cards. That said, you can install a half-height card in either of the remaining slots, one x1 and one x16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Aside from the two M.2 slots on the motherboard, the only additional drive support is behind the motherboard, where there’s room for either two 2.5-inch drives or a single 3.5-inch drive. Meanwhile, memory expansion is more forgiving – our test unit has two of the four UDIMM slots open, and the board supports 192GB of RAM.</p><p>The 750-watt power supply isn’t modular, but it covers the standard connectors and delivers enough juice for mid- to enthusiast-tier GPUs. With clearance for cards up to 422 mm long, this case shouldn’t hold you back when it’s time to upgrade.</p><h2 id="gaming-and-graphics-on-the-ibuypower-y40-pro-2">Gaming and Graphics on the iBuyPower Y40 Pro</h2><p>Our Y40 Pro test configuration features a Ryzen 9 7900X CPU, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and 32GB of DDR5-5200 RAM.</p><p>For my game testing, I fired up <em>F1 24</em> and played at the game’s Ultra preset at 3840 x 2160 with DLSS enabled, seeing anywhere from the high-80 to the low-100 frames per second range.

At 4K, however, both systems leveled out at 89 FPS. The RTX 5070-powered Asus predictably fell behind, posting 199 FPS at 1080p and 68 FPS at 4K.</p><p>In <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> demanding Ray Tracing Ultra preset, the Y40 Pro narrowed the gap, achieving 87 FPS at 1080p compared to the Corsair’s 95 FPS. At 4K, both machines converged again, each producing 29 FPS.</p><p><em>Far Cry 6</em> at Ultra settings showed a wider disparity at 1080p, with the Y40 Pro reaching 125 FPS while the Corsair surges ahead at 197 FPS. At 4K, the performance is almost identical. The Asus sits between the two, with 110 FPS at 1080p and 80 FPS at 4K.</p><p>In <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (Medium preset), the Y40 Pro clocked in at 161 FPS at 1080p, just behind the Corsair’s 174 FPS. At 4K, the difference is negligible: 66 FPS for the Y40 Pro and 67 FPS for the Corsair. The Asus trailed again, with 120 FPS at 1080p and 50 FPS at 4K.</p><p>Finally, in <em>Borderlands 3</em> at the “Badass” preset, the Y40 Pro stayed competitive, posting 215 FPS versus the Corsair’s 227 FPS at 1080p. Both systems match at 94 FPS at 4K. The Asus finished with 175 FPS and 74 FPS, respectively.</p><p>Overall, the Y40 Pro delivers stable gaming performance, though it falls short of the Corsair in CPU-intensive titles and lower resolutions, where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D clearly extracts more from the RTX 5070 Ti. At 4K, where GPU limitations are apparent, the two systems perform nearly identically. Since the Y40 Pro is also available with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, its performance gap isn’t necessarily a strike against it, though as of this review, no RTX 5070 Ti configuration was available with that chip (see the configuration section for more).</p><p>To evaluate sustained gaming performance, we run 15 loops of the <em>Metro Exodus </em>stress test at RTX settings. During the approximately 30-minute test, the Y40 produced an average framerate of 163 FPS across all runs, with almost no variation between runs.

While the primary buttons and scroll wheel feel like nothing special, it does include two side buttons and a DPI toggle behind the wheel. A dedicated RGB switch on the underside cycles through ten LED modes, including off. The lighting is impressively bright, with effects like breathing, strobing, solid color, and a starlight mode that illuminates sections of the mouse in sequence.</p><p>Despite its membrane construction, the keyboard delivers a surprisingly tactile typing experience. I had no trouble maintaining my usual speed of about 120 words per minute and near-perfect accuracy on MonkeyType. It lacks premium features like USB passthroughs, but compensates with vibrant RGB backlighting across multiple colors. Lighting is controlled directly via Fn+ScrollLock, with options for static or breathing effects, and can be disabled using Fn+Pause. Flip-out feet provide a slight incline for ergonomic comfort, though iBuyPower unfortunately doesn’t include a palm rest.</p><h2 id="software-and-warranty-2">Software and Warranty</h2><p>Besides the usual smattering of Windows 11 default apps, iBuyPower preloads no software onto the Y40 Pro, which is mostly great.

Our Y40 Pro test unit, a $2,099 model from Amazon, uses the older Ryzen 7 7900X CPU; an $1,899 version at Best Buy swaps in the Ryzen 9 9700X and keeps all other specifications the same, including the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD.</p><p>Other configurations available at Best Buy begin at $1,499 with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Radeon RX 7800 XT, followed by a $1,599 model with a Ryzen 7 8700F and RTX 5070, and a $1,699 option pairing a Ryzen 7 7800X3D with a Radeon RX 9070. Higher-tier models include a $1,999 build with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Radeon RX 9070XT, and a $2,299 version matching our test unit’s specs but upgraded to a Ryzen 9 9900X.

Above-average peripherals and competitive pricing further enhance its value proposition.</p><p>That said, noticeable fan noise detracts from the overall experience, and the limited RGB customization may disappoint users seeking more personalization. While most won’t need to expand storage or install additional full-height PCIe cards, it’s worth noting that the chassis offers little flexibility in those areas.</p><p>Ultimately, the Y40 Pro is among the more stylish mid-towers we’ve tested and holds its own against competitors like the Asus ROG G700.

<![CDATA[ Find My Parking Cops uses data scraped from City website to track parking fines in real time — entire website dedicated to helping San Francisco motorists avoid parking tickets goes live ]]>
<p>A software engineer named Riley Walz has built a website that scrapes the data from the City of San Francisco website, allowing him to track issued parking tickets in real-time and the location where the officers wrote them. The information is readily available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://walzr.com/sf-parking/">Find My Parking Cops</a> web app, and uses an interface similar to Apple’s Find My app, making it quick and easy to use.</p><p>Overlaid on a top-down view of San Francisco, you get a list of active officers at the moment, plus a leaderboard showing the total value of the tickets a particular officer has issued for the current week. Walz shared his creation on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/rtwlz/status/1970536901733130741">X</a> — A few hours later, the City took down the website date, briefly rendering his creation useless. Nevertheless, he was able to create a workaround, restoring the functionality of the tracking site, at least for now.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://walzr.com/sf-parking/about/">Walz</a>, he was inspired to create the page after his roommate received a parking ticket. The website where you pay the penalty also shows a full copy of the citation, as long as you have its number. When you input the correct information, you’ll see all the details related to the parking offence, including the make, color, and license plate of the offending vehicle, the reason for the ticket, and the issuing officer’s initials.</p><p>One other roadblock that he encountered was the ticket number — at the moment, the system lists nearly a billion tickets, but he thinks that this is nowhere near the real number of parking violations in San Francisco. When he added one to the ticket that his friend had, the San Francisco website returned an error. But after some more experimentation and digging around, he discovered the tickets were numbered by increments of 11, except for when the last digit is 6, by which you add 4 to get the next ticket number. This pattern allowed him to predict the next parking citation to be issued, making for easier tracking. He was also able to figure out the claim ID, allowing him to pull out all the details of the ticket.</p><p>Armed with this information, he created a scraper that copied and stored all the parking tickets as soon as they were created. They then used a borrowed Apple Maps API key to put the data on a map, allowing anyone to see the locations, the number of tickets, as well as the total fines a particular parking cop has issued during their shift. Naturally, this information could be used to avoid parking fines, a benefit Walz himself touts, with users able to see a rough spread of where parking cops might be issuing tickets at any given time.</p><p>While not exactly illegal, this shows how easy it can be to gather data from the internet if you know what you’re doing. However, it can also raise some privacy issues, especially since the parking tickets often have personal data on them. The City of San Francisco definitely needs to secure its parking ticket system, but it also needs to ensure that citizens can retain easy access to the payment portal to settle their violations. In the meantime, this map is available for anyone to see, that is, until San Francisco fixes their system and makes it just a little bit more secure.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Intel could be working on its own multi-frame generation tech — XeSS MFG name and logo found in Arc graphics driver files ]]>
<p>New code unearthed in Intel's Arc graphics driver files could point to the company's plans to launch its own answer to Nvidia's multi-frame generation tech. Multi-frame generation, or MFG for short, debuted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-dlss-4-is-the-magic-bullet-behind-the-rtx-50-series-touted-2x-performance-reflex-2-multi-frame-gen-ai-tools-come-to-the-fore?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">Nvidia's keynote last year</a> as part of its pitch for the RTX 50 series. Ada Lovelace could already do regular frame gen — inserting an AI-generated frame between two real ones — but Blackwell took it one step further — using up to three interpolated frames created from an actually rendered one. So far, neither Intel nor AMD has an answer to this, though that appears to be changing soon, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IntelArc/comments/1nomuhk/driver_built_xess_frame_generation_might_be_on/" target="_blank">according to the r/IntelArc subreddit</a>.</p><p>Scouring through the latest Arc drivers, user <em>u/Organic-Bird-587 </em>stumbled upon a mention of "Multi-Frame Generation (XeSS)" in the files. That was accompanied by an image that could potentially be the new logo for Intel's MFG, suggesting that the chipmaker might be working on its own multi-frame generation tech set to debut soon. Despite Arc facing fresh scrutiny following the recent Nvidia-Intel deal, the company is still believed to be working on Battlemage — its current-gen discrete GPU architecture — and states it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-says-it-remains-committed-to-its-arc-graphics-project-intel-will-continue-to-have-gpu-product-offerings" target="_blank">remains committed to its Arc graphics project</a>, which could include its fabled B770 card.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"

AMD currently offers no MFG solution of its own, so this could be the moment to establish a unique selling point for Arc versus AMD graphics cards. Still, it's important to note that this is purely speculative, and finding trinkets of unreleased or unannounced products is commonplace in driver code — until there's confirmation from Intel, take this with a huge grain of salt, although it would make sense given the current landscape.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">Nvidia's historic $5 billion investment into Intel</a> last week seemed to put the company's Arc graphics lineup in jeopardy, especially after the announcement that would see Intel create new chips featuring GPU chiplets from Nvidia. Intel later clarified that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-says-it-remains-committed-to-its-arc-graphics-project-intel-will-continue-to-have-gpu-product-offerings">Arc will remain in development</a> and that RTX GPUs are "complementary" — a stance that lines up with this news, as MFG is purely Nvidia's play at the moment, so offering a competitor to that almost reinforces hope that Arc is still on the battlefront, fighting to carve out its own space in a crowded market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

<![CDATA[ Nvidia and Intel’s RTX SoCs could pose an existential threat to AMD’s APUs — if the two companies can actually pull it off ]]>
<p>For years, AMD’s most dangerous weapon hasn’t been its killer desktop CPUs or its most efficient laptop chips. It’s been the APU, a quiet killer of discrete GPUs in gaming consoles, handhelds, and notebooks alike. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-launches-ryzen-ai-300-and-200-series-chips-for-laptops">Ryzen AI 300</a> series, AMD proved it could pair 16-core Zen 5 CPUs with RDNA 3.5 GPUs and a 50 TOPS NPU into a single power-efficient die. It was a pitch neither Intel nor Nvidia could match. Until now.</p><p>In a surprise move last week, Intel and Nvidia jointly confirmed that the companies will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-and-intel-announce-jointly-developed-intel-x86-rtx-socs-for-pcs-with-nvidia-graphics-also-custom-nvidia-data-center-x86-processors-nvidia-buys-usd5-billion-in-intel-stock-in-seismic-deal">co-develop x86 system-on-chip</a> modules that package Intel CPUs and Nvidia RTX GPU chiplets together, bound by NVLink and unified memory. These “RTX SoCs” are being positioned as premium integrated chips that can power laptops, desktops, and consumer AI systems without a discrete GPU. Should AMD be afraid?</p><h2 id="a-packaged-counterattack-2">A packaged counterattack</h2><p>The idea is simple. Intel will supply the CPU tile, and Nvidia will supply the GPU tile. Both are joined in a single multi-die package using Intel’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/why-nvidias-5bn-partnership-is-about-intels-packaging">advanced Foveros and EMIB interconnects</a>, the same technologies Intel uses to stack and stitch together chiplets on its own high-end platforms. The critical link is Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink, which offers up to 900 GB/s of on-package bandwidth, more than ten times faster than PCIe 4.0.</p><p>There are parallels with AMD’s APUs: one package, one memory pool, CPU and GPU working in lockstep. The difference is scale: Where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/more-affordable-strix-halo-model-emerges-early-ryzen-ai-max-385-geekbench-result-reveals-an-eight-core-option">AMD’s Strix Halo</a> tops out at 40 RDNA 3.5 compute units and a 50 TOPS NPU, an Intel/Nvidia SoC could pack a full RTX-class GPU with ray-tracing cores, tensor units, and CUDA throughput tuned for both gaming and AI.</p><p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it “a new class of integrated graphics laptops the world has never seen before,” in a joint press conference following the announcement. What Nvidia and Intel are proposing is essentially a top-down rethink of what a CPU package can include. Instead of discrete compute domains with duplicated memory, we’re looking at a system that acts more like a single accelerated core — x86 and RTX fused into one thermal envelope, designed to scale from thin-and-lights to AI-enabled workstations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Built on TSMC’s 4nm process, it pairs up to 16 Zen 5 cores with a 40-CU RDNA 3.5 GPU, supports 128GB of LPDDR5X-8000, and houses a dedicated NPU delivering 50 TOPS. Bandwidth is supplied by a massive LPDDR5X interface, backed by 32MB of cache. Performance is competitive with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-asus-dual">RTX 4060</a>, but in a tighter, more power-efficient design. AMD sells it as a no-GPU-needed package. And for many workloads, that’s exactly what it is. However, it comes with clear power and bandwidth constraints, as well as the limitations of an integrated GPU die.</p><p>Nvidia and Intel’s blueprint attacks those constraints directly. The GPU tile going into these SoCs isn’t some low-end mobile salvage part. According to Huang, it’s an RTX chiplet, which should mean full ray-tracing, CUDA, and Tensor cores — in other words, a fully-fledged GPU. Then there’s the inclusion of NVLink, which provides far more bandwidth and superior latency than PCIe, allowing the CPU and GPU to share memory with limited bandwidth and latency penalties. Meanwhile, Foveros 3D packaging means each die can be built on its optimal process node, rather than compromised in a monolithic slab.</p><p>In comparison, AMD’s integrated GPU has to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-unwraps-ryzen-ai-300-series-strix-point-processors-50-tops-of-ai-performance-zen-5c-density-cores-come-to-ryzen-9-for-the-first-time">share die area</a> with the CPU and NPU. The Nvidia-Intel package will not be vertically integrated; instead, it will be asymmetric. “Nvidia’s GPU technology is based on TSMC’s foundry… connecting Nvidia’s GPU die chiplet with Intel’s CPUs in a multi-technology packaging capability… it’s really a fabulous way of mixing and matching technology,” Huang said during the press conference.</p><p>But silicon isn’t built in press releases. The challenges for the duo will include coordinating dies from different fabs, tuning thermals in laptop envelopes, and persuading OEMs to bet on yet another premium part.</p><h2 id="a-solid-business-case-for-nvidia-and-intel-2">A solid business case for Nvidia and Intel</h2><p>There’s a genuine business case for RTX SoCs that the duo could tap into. Laptops that currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-16-9640-and-xps-14-9440-review">rely on a Core Ultra CPU and a discrete RTX 4050/70</a> could instead ship with a single chip. That means a smaller motherboard, a simpler power subsystem, and less thermal juggling between CPU and GPU. Fewer parts may also result in a lower failure rate and potentially lower costs, but that depends on many unknown factors.</p><p>And then there’s branding. AMD has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/gaming-laptops/i-got-excited-for-the-idea-of-sub-usd1-000-gaming-laptops-with-integrated-graphics-but-there-are-more-than-a-few-reasons-why-thats-probably-not-happening">struggled to convince laptop buyers</a> that its integrated graphics are serious gaming tools, even when they match or exceed performance expectations. Nvidia doesn’t have that problem. If the sticker says “RTX,” the assumption is that it’s fast. OEMs will lean into that, even if it means higher chip costs. Nvidia owns more than 90% of the discrete GPU market, and its RTX logo is a selling point that AMD has never matched in consumer mindshare. If Intel can price these SoCs competitively, we’ll likely see major brands like Asus and MSI lining up to buy them.</p><p>The flip side to all this is cost. Combining Intel’s leading-edge CPUs with Nvidia’s premium GPU chiplets won’t come cheap. AMD’s APUs may lose out in raw power, but their vertical integration makes them cheaper to fab and easier to bin. For price-sensitive segments, such as budget gaming laptops and mainstream productivity notebooks, AMD will likely maintain its foothold. But that’s fine, because Nvidia and Intel are aiming higher up the stack, where OEMs already spend freely for discrete GPUs.</p><h2 id="the-specter-of-the-unknown-2">The specter of the unknown</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

Its APU roadmap is in-house with seamless integration. Nvidia and Intel, by contrast, are looking to run chiplets from two vendors on different process nodes and different fabs. But that might not matter from an OEM’s point of view. If the Nvidia-Intel SoC is cheaper than a GPU+CPU combo and faster than an APU, it’s not a tough decision.</p><p>Of course, none of this exists yet. The silicon from the partnership is expected no sooner than 2027, and Intel has said it remains <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-says-it-remains-committed-to-its-arc-graphics-project-intel-will-continue-to-have-gpu-product-offerings">committed to Arc graphics</a>. However, the reality is that Intel and Nvidia will be building a whole new stack, which could represent an existential threat in one of AMD’s fastest-growing categories. Strix Halo was designed to expand the company’s APU footprint beyond cheap laptops, into gaming notebooks, and even small desktop systems. Our own testing shows that it largely succeeded — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-ryzen-ai-300-series-apus-could-offer-gpu-performance-on-par-with-low-end-discrete-gpus">an AMD APU that can trade blows with low-end discrete GPUs</a> — but Intel and Nvidia are promising a leap beyond that, with IP that AMD cannot easily match.</p><p>The most important word in this entire partnership is “if.” If Intel can deliver leading-edge x86 cores on time. If Nvidia can make its GPU chiplets play nice with Intel’s CPUs. If unified memory over NVLink works in practice as well as in theory. And if OEMs buy into the concept at scale.</p><p>For now, the roadmap for the first launch could conceivably stretch into 2027, which gives AMD time to respond and leaves plenty of room for execution risk. Remember Kaby Lake-G? Intel’s ill-fated 2017 experiment fusing its CPU with AMD graphics <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-discontinue-kaby-lake-g-amd-graphics,40577.html">didn’t survive a single generation</a>. Still, the stakes are higher this time, as AI workloads balloon and gaming laptops represent a core growth market, and both Intel and Nvidia need each other to counterbalance AMD’s momentum.</p><p>If they can pull it off, AMD could face its toughest competition yet in the market it helped create, and Intel, long the laggard in GPUs, will suddenly have RTX inside.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ GPD Win 5 handheld soars with AMD's Strix Halo — gaming deck is almost twice as fast as Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 competitors at same power ]]>
<p>More content creators are getting their hands on GPD's incredibly potent Win 5 handheld gaming PC, sporting AMD's flagship Strix Halo APU. YouTube hardware tester <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuQelz8q7Iw&t">The Phawx</a> has turned in his initial impressions of the handheld, particularly against competing AMD handhelds with more "conventional" hardware. He found the GPD Win 5 is up to twice as fast as competing Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handhelds while consuming the same amount of power (at 25W to 35W TDP).</p><p>The Phawx provided a limited benchmark comparison between the flagship Ryzen AI Max 395+-powered GPD Win 5 and a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handheld system. In these comparisons, the GPD Win 5 shows an astonishing amount of performance headroom thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-beastly-strix-halo-ryzen-ai-max-matches-the-rtx-4060-laptop-in-leaked-3dmark-tests">RTX 4060-class GPU</a> on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 SoC.</p><p>In <em>Returnal</em>, the GPD Win 5 ran at nearly twice the framerate as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 handheld The Phawx was using for these tests with both systems running at the same 25-watt power limit. The GPD Win 5 produced about 80 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld ran at around 45 FPS.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuQelz8q7Iw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>; the GPD Win 5 ran at 56 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld turned out 31 FPS. The cherry on top is that the GPD Win 5 was running at higher graphical fidelity using FSR Quality upscaling instead of FSR Balanced on the HX 370 handheld.</p><p>Furthermore, the Strix Halo 395+ offers even greater performance margins at higher power limits, thanks to its impressive specifications. According to these tests, the GPD Win 5's implementation of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 only starts hitting diminishing performance returns at 40 watts or greater. By contrast, HX 370-handhelds start producing diminishing performance returns at 18 watts or greater.</p><p>In God of War: Ragnarok, The Phawx reports that the GPD Win 5 runs at around 85 FPS at 25 watts, and the HX 370-powered handheld 67 FPS at the same power limit. However, bumping up the power limit to 70 watts on the GPD Win 5 produces a colossal jump all the way up to 176 FPS.</p><p>The only caveat with the GPD Win 5's monstrous APU is that it doesn't behave well at ultra-low power limits. Below 25 watts, the Win 5's Strix Halo APU reportedly produces performance results that are barely any better than the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. This performance behavior also extends to CPU-bound titles, since both CPUs take advantage of the same Zen 5 CPU architecture.</p><p>Still, these initial tests demonstrate the sheer power Strix Halo can offer when squeezed inside of a handheld gaming PC. Strix Halo wasn't designed to be a handheld gaming chip; it's more commonly seen in laptops and mini-PCs. Its massive 442mm² die sports 16 Zen 5 CPU cores and an RDNA 3.5 GPU with as many compute units as a PS5 (40 CUs in all). Somehow, GPD was able to figure out a way to fit this monstrous chip inside of its Win 5 handheld without sacrificing comfort or usability.</p><p>Once it hits the market, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/amd-strix-halo-gaming-handheld-lacks-an-internal-battery-gpd-win-5-requires-an-external-battery-or-be-plugged-into-the-wall">GPD Win 5</a> will likely be the world's first handheld to be powered by Strix Halo, and will almost certainly be the fastest handheld in the world as a result. The device will come in three trims: a baseline model sporting the Ryzen AI Max 385 with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, a mid-range option with the same storage and memory but with the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395, and there's a top-of-the-line model with the 395 chip, 64GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ China's latest GPU arrives with claims of CUDA compatibility and RT support — Fenghua No.3 also boasts 112GB+ of HBM memory for AI
]]>
<p>While Innosilicon Technology's products may not be prominently featured on the list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html">best graphics cards</a>, the company has been hard at work developing its Fenghua (translated as Fantasy) series of graphics cards. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/884/981.htm">ITHome</a> reported, Innosilicon recently unveiled the Fenghua No. 3, the company's latest flagship GPU. The company promises that its third GPU iteration is a significant advancement over its predecessors.</p><p>While previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/china-fenghua-no1-gpu-certification">Fenghua No.1</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/innosilicon-fenghua-no-2-gpu-launching-august-3">Fenghua No.2</a> graphics cards were based on Imagination Technologies' PowerVR IP, the new Fenghua No.3 leverages the open-source RISC-V architecture instead. The graphics card reportedly borrows a page from OpenCore Institute's Nanhu V3 project.</p><p>The company representative didn't provide any more details on the Fenghua No.3 during the launch event, only that it features a home-grown design from the ground up. The Fenghua No.3 is also purportedly compatible with Nvidia's proprietary CUDA platform, which could open many doors for the graphics card if it holds true.</p><p>The Fenghua No.3 is designed for a bunch of different workloads, as Innosilicon describes it as an "all-function GPU" (translation). The company plans to deploy the graphics card in different sectors, including AI, scientific computing, CAD work, medical imaging, and gaming. Therefore, it's safe to assume there will be other variants of the Fenghua No.3.</p><h2 id="the-fenghua-no-3-is-a-jack-of-all-trades-2">The Fenghua No.3 is a jack of all trades</h2><p>From a gaming perspective, the Fenghua No.3 claims support for the latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6. The graphics card is also reportedly equipped to support ray tracing. The team demonstrated the Fenghua No.3 in titles such as <em>Tomb Raider</em>, <em>Delta Force</em>, and <em>Valorant </em>at the press conference, and reports claim that the gameplay was smooth. However, there was no available information on game settings, resolution, and actual frame rates, so take these claims with a grain of salt.</p><p>The Fenghua No.3 reportedly comes equipped with 112GB+ of HBM memory, making it an ideal product for AI. A single Fenghua No. 3 can handle 32B and 72B LLM models, while eight of them in unison work with 671B and 685B parameter models. Innosilicon claims unconditional support for the DeepSeek V3, R1, and V3.1 models, as well as the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families.</p><p>Innosilicon also boasted that the Fenghua No.3 is China's first graphics card to support the YUV444 format, which offers the best color detail and fidelity—a feature particularly beneficial for users who perform extensive CAD industrial work or video editing. The manufacturer also highlighted the Fenghua No.3's support for 8K (7680 x 4320) displays. The graphics card can drive up to six 8K monitors at 30 Hz.</p><p>The Fenghua No.3 is the world's first graphics card to offer native support for DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine). It enables the precise visualization of X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds on standard monitors, eliminating the need for costly, specialized grayscale medical displays.</p><p>China's semiconductor industry is gradually improving. Although it is unlikely to rival that of the United States in the near future, it may not necessarily need to do so. China's primary goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in key areas. Announcements such as the Fenghua No.3 may seem insignificant individually. Collectively, they might amass into substantial progress, akin to accumulating grains of sand that eventually form a small beach.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI raises big antitrust concerns — legal experts and policymakers raise eyebrows over potential for market imbalance ]]>
<p>Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, marking an unprecedented financial and strategic alignment between the leading AI hardware provider and one of the best-known developers of artificial intelligence models. However, the deal raises major antitrust concerns among legal experts and policymakers over potential market imbalance, as in both cases the investment can impact competitors of both companies, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/nvidias-100-billion-openai-play-raises-big-antitrust-issues-2025-09-23/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p><h2 id="a-lot-of-concerns-2">A lot of concerns</h2><p>The planned investment raises questions about how the cash infusion could affect Nvidia's other customers and the overall AI hardware market. Nvidia already commands the lion's share of the market for hardware used for AI training and inference, as virtually all AI companies use its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, so they rely on access to Nvidia’s GPUs to scale their own models. Legal experts note that Nvidia's investment may create incentives to prioritize OpenAI over others, potentially offering better terms or faster access to a limited supply of leading-edge GPUs, such as Rubin.</p><p>In response, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-promises-its-usd100-billion-openai-deal-wont-impact-gpu-supply-we-will-continue-to-make-every-customer-a-top-priority">representative for Nvidia stated that the company's commitment to all of its clients remains unchanged</a>. The spokesperson emphasized that having a financial interest in any one partner would not affect how the company serves others, assuring that every customer will continue to receive the same level of attention and service.</p><p>Additionally, if OpenAI prefers hardware from Nvidia over hardware from its rivals, such as AMD, or even its own processor developed in collaboration with Broadcom, then Nvidia will get an unfair advantage. Keeping in mind that OpenAI is believed to have acquired $10 billion worth of custom-built AI processors from Broadcom, it is unlikely that it won't deploy them, but now that Nvidia will provide OpenAI hardware worth tens of billions of dollars, the AI company will continue to do more work on Nvidia's hardware rather than on competing processors.</p><p>OpenAI currently operates as a non-profit but is pursuing a transition to a for-profit public benefit corporation. This structural change is meant to facilitate investment while maintaining oversight by the original non-profit entity. The arrangement with Nvidia does not provide governance rights — only financial participation — and may depend on regulatory approvals in states like Delaware and California, where OpenAI is registered.</p><h2 id="multi-phase-agreement-2">Multi-phase agreement</h2><p>Nvidia and OpenAI finalized the $100 billion deal after weeks of private negotiations between chief executives Jensen Huang and Sam Altman, reports <em>CNBC</em>. The companies came to final terms just before a major infrastructure reveal in Texas on Monday, which is surprising given the scale of the deal. While the agreement is inked between Nvidia and OpenAI, the data centers that the latter will build will be a part of the Stargate project, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/altman-huang-negotiations-that-sealed-100-billion-openai-nvidia-deal.html" target="_blank"><em>CNBC</em></a>.</p><p>The initial phase of the agreement involves Nvidia investing $10 billion to help OpenAI deploy 1 GW data center using Nvidia's upcoming Vera Rubin chips, with construction slated to begin in the second half of 2026. According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the total cost per gigawatt is around $50 billion: $35 billion is for Nvidia hardware and $15 billion is for facilities and other infrastructure, which implies that Nvidia is not financing the entire build-out. OpenAI would still need to secure roughly $40 billion per gigawatt from other sources.</p><p>The subsequent phases of the plan include scaling compute capacity to 10 GW, which would require the full $90 billion investment from Nvidia and $400 billion from OpenAI. The company has not disclosed how it plans to obtain the remaining capital, nor has it confirmed whether it shares Nvidia's cost assumptions.</p><p>Interestingly, Nvidia’s initial $10 billion input is based on a $500 billion valuation for OpenAI, but CNBC claims future investments will be based on OpenAI's valuation at the time, so could fluctuate. There is also no specific timeline for when the full 10 GW of capacity will be operational or when the remaining $90 billion will be deployed.</p><h2 id="bigger-picture-2">Bigger picture</h2><p>U.S. regulators have previously flagged the risk of major technology firms leveraging their existing dominance to control emerging AI markets. Officials from the Department of Justice have emphasized the importance of averting exclusionary practices in the AI supply chain, including restricted access to processors and compute infrastructure.</p><p>The potential effects extend beyond hardware. Oracle recently disclosed that it had signed large-scale cloud contracts with OpenAI and other clients, boosting its valuation. With Nvidia's investment potentially strengthening OpenAI's financial position, Oracle's revenue projections may appear more credible, something that will address investor concerns about OpenAI's ability to fund such commitments, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/more-questions-than-answers-nvidias-100-billion-openai-deal-2025-09-23/">Reuters</a>.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Nvidia's planned $100 billion investment in OpenAI represents a historic alliance between the dominant AI GPU developer and a leading AI model developer, but it raises serious antitrust concerns over potential market favoritism, supply chain imbalances, and regulatory scrutiny.

<p>If you don't have a PC-based gaming handheld, it can be hard to comprehend what all the fuss is about. This is the fastest-growing sector of the PC gaming space, though, and there's a reason. If you'd like to find out for yourself why everyone from Asus to Zotac is making aming handhelds, you can try out the original Valve Steam Deck LCD with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">256GB SSD for just $319.20 right now, straight from Valve</a>.</p><p>The Steam Deck LCD has been slightly overshadowed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/steam-deck-oled" target="_blank">its younger OLED sibling</a>, but they're not far apart in gaming performance, and many of the games that you'd really want to play on a Steam Deck — indie titles like <em>CrossCode</em>, <em>Holocure: Save the Fans</em>, <em>UFO 50</em>, <em>Celeste</em>, and <em>Hades</em> — are actually capped at 60 FPS and unable to take full advantage of the 90-Hz screen on the Steam Deck OLED anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Check out the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on Steam</a></li></ul><p>For $319.20, you get the original Steam Deck LCD with its 7" screen and 40-Whr battery (Valve touts 2-8 hours of gameplay; we found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" target="_blank">2-6 in our review</a>), a 45W power supply with 1.5-meter cable, and a carrying case.

We're likely to see deep discounts on delightful games that will play perfectly on the Steam Deck, like the ones we mentioned above, as well as titles like <em>Lost Castle II</em>, <em>30XX</em>, the <em>Shantae</em> series, <em>Cuphead</em>, the <em>Blasphemous</em> series, and the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.

Ultimately, unless performance is a real issue, the experience of playing a game on the Steam Deck OLED (or, say, an ASUS ROG Ally) is not going to be fundamentally different from the Steam Deck LCD.</p><p>It also must be noted that $319.20 is an awfully cheap way to get a full-on Linux PC with 16GB of memory and 256GB of fast solid-state storage.

<![CDATA[ AI buildouts need $2 trillion in annual revenue to sustain growth, but massive cash shortfall looms — even generous forecasts highlight $800 billion black hole, says report ]]>
<p>AI’s insatiable power appetite is both expensive and unsustainable. That’s the main takeaway from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-can-we-meet-ais-insatiable-demand-for-compute-power-technology-report-2025/" target="_blank">new report by Bain & Company</a>, which puts a staggering number on what it will cost to keep feeding AI’s compute appetite — more than $500 billion per year in global data-center investment by 2030, with $2 trillion in annual revenue required to make that capex viable. Even under generous assumptions, Bain estimates the AI industry will come up $800 billion short.</p><p>It’s a sobering reality check for the narrative currently surrounding AI, one that cuts through the trillion-parameter hype cycles and lands squarely in the physics and economics of infrastructure. If Bain is right, the industry is hurtling toward a wall where power constraints, limited GPU availability, and capital bottlenecks converge.</p><p>The crux of Bain’s argument is that compute demand is scaling faster than the tools that supply it. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intels-ceo-says-moores-law-is-slowing-to-a-three-year-cadence-but-its-not-dead-yet">Moore’s Law has slowed to a crawl</a>, AI workloads haven’t. Bain estimates that inference and training requirements have grown at more than twice the rate of transistor density, forcing data center operators to brute-force scale rather than rely on per-chip efficiency gains. The result is a global AI compute footprint that could hit 200 GW by 2030, with half of it in the U.S. alone.</p><p>That kind of headache is going to require massive, borderline inconceivable upgrades to local grids, years-long lead times on electrical gear, and thousands of tons of high-end cooling. Worse, many of the core enabling silicon, like HBM and CoWoS, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/hbm-supply-from-sk-hynix-and-micron-sold-out-until-late-2025">already supply-constrained</a>. Nvidia’s own commentary this year, echoed in Bain’s report, suggests that demand is outstripping the industry’s ability to deliver on every axis except pricing.</p><p>If capital dries up or plateaus, hyperscalers will double down on systems that offer the best return per watt and per square foot. That elevates full-rack GPU platforms like Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-mi300x-performance-compared-with-nvidia-h100">AMD’s Instinct MI300X</a> pods, where thermal density and interconnect efficiency dominate the BOM. It also deprioritizes lower-volume configs, especially those based on mainstream workstation parts and, by extension, cuts down the supply of chips that could’ve made their way into high-end desktops.</p><p>There are also implications on the PC side. If training remains cost-bound and data-center inference runs into power ceilings, more of the workload shifts to the edge. That plays directly into the hands of laptop and desktop OEMs now shipping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-quietly-reveals-cheapest-ryzen-ai-yet-ai-5-330-is-a-quad-core-budget-processor-with-a-50-tops-npu">NPUs in the 40 to 60 TOPS range</a>, and Bain’s framing helps explain why: Inference at the edge isn’t just faster, it’s also cheaper and less capital-intensive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the race continues. Microsoft recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-announces-worlds-most-powerful-ai-data-center-315-acre-site-to-house-hundreds-of-thousands-of-nvidia-gpus-and-enough-fiber-to-circle-the-earth-4-5-times">bumped its Wisconsin AI data-center</a> spend to more than $7 billion. Amazon, Meta, and Google are each committing billions more, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/xai-pushes-power-strategy-towards-1gw-ai-factory">as is xAI</a>, but most of that funding is already spoken for in terms of GPU allocation and model development. As Bain points out, even those aggressive numbers may not be enough to bridge the cost-to-revenue delta.</p><p>If anything, this report reinforces the tension at the heart of the current AI cycle. On one side, you have infrastructure that takes years to build, staff, and power. On the other hand, you have models that double in size and cost every six months, giving credence to the fears of an AI bubble that, if it continues to grow, will mean high-end silicon and the memory and cooling that come with it could stay both scarce and expensive well into the next decade.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Intel drops day zero game driver support for chips released last year — last-gen iGPUs on 14th-gen Core and older CPUs already put on the backburner of legacy software support ]]>
<p>Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000101986/graphics.html">The company says</a> that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.</p><p>This announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new —
the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.</p><p>While an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-axes-thousands-of-technicians-and-engineers-in-sweeping-u-s-layoffs-cutting-4-000-positions-in-the-u-s-2-392-in-oregon">Intel has cut 4,000 positions</a> in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.</p><p>Still, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.</p><p>Nevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6s-modest-system-requirements-open-the-doors-to-gamers-of-all-budgets-six-year-old-gpus-meet-minimum-recommendations" target="_blank">the upcoming Battlefield 6</a>, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.</p><p>Even though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ This $12 external CD/DVD drive plays your old discs through a modern USB-C interface — at 35% off, this drive is an exceptional deal at Amazon ]]>
<p>I recently encountered an issue where I needed to retrieve data from an old DVD backup disk, but I had no access to a disk drive on either my laptop or PC. Who even uses physical media these days? Well... this guy. It might be the first time in years that I've even thought about this problem, and definitely over a decade since I've used a CD/DVD to backup anything, but now that I want to access some of the old media I've found in the attic, I'm stuck. The number of times I'm probably going to use a drive means I don't want to spend too much on one, and with a swathe of generic drives available, I've found a great deal on one at Amazon that costs next to nothing.</p><p>Available at Amazon for the low price of just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5V3RV3X">$12.99, the Gotega External USB 3.0 Type C CD/DVD Drive</a> is a bargain at this price. If you clip the coupon box on the page, you can save $7 (35%) off the $19.99 list price. You do have to have an Amazon account and be logged in to be able to clip the coupon and see the price reduction in the basket ahead of any purchase.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B5V3RV3X">Check out the deal at Amazon</a></li></ul><p>Now, this is a generic portable external USB 3.0 Type-C CD/DVD drive; the casing is the same one used on several unfamiliar brand names, but if you're looking at buying an LG, Hitachi, or Samsung drive, then you can easily expect to pay more than double for the pleasure. This drive doesn't come with any software for ripping and burning disks, so if you want those extras, it might be worth going with a premium brand name.</p><div class="product star-deal"><a data-dimension112="a36f479b-adfc-435c-ac62-ab68444f93c3" data-action="Star Deal Block" data-label="For easy compatibility with modern PCs and laptop computers, the Gotega CD/DVD external drive can plug into your computer via a spare USB port.

<![CDATA[ Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 2TB SSD Review: A Rhapsody in Blue ]]>
<p>Thanks to the performance we see with the Sandisk WD Blue SN5100, the market now has not just one great QLC SSD, but <em>two</em> great QLC SSDs. This turn of events was unfathomable a generation of drives ago, but the components are now mature enough to offer great value for everyday users and storage enthusiasts alike. We were first impressed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review"><u>Crucial's P310,</u></a> but the Blue SN5100 has quietly come along to redefine what a QLC drive can do.</p><p>Sandisk has followed up on the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>SN8100</u></a> with another compelling mid-range Blue drive, bumping performance up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-sn5000-4tb-ssd-review"><u>SN5000</u></a>. The Blue drives have always been a popular and inexpensive option, but in some cases, the different models felt overlapping, even with some of the lower-end Black drives, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn770-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>SN770</u></a>. It’s almost too much of a good thing. Now, with the SN5100 coming in hot with QLC flash, which the previous SN5000 only used at 4TB, we have a drive designed for everyone.</p><p>All of WD’s and Sandisk’s many Blue NVMe SSDs have been good budget performers to the point that it sometimes gets confusing to discern one from another; the controllers and flash used are scalable in that way. The Blue SN5100 carries on with this tradition, but it’s also marking the full transition from TLC to QLC flash. This might horrify some people, but the fact is, this drive performs well for 99% of typical users. You’d have difficulty in a blind taste test between this and the TLC-equipped Black SN7100, and if Sandisk can get the price down to an appropriate level, that’s a very attractive reality.</p><p>We still prefer the Blue SN5100 as a secondary or game-focused drive, or perhaps as a budget laptop upgrade drive, but we think it’s to the point that this drive could work anywhere. It feels like it could replace low-end TLC options without issue. There’s something about this drive that puts it ahead of the pack in comparison to some of the older QLC drives, mostly due to the flash. It’s power-efficient and has excellent latency, which makes it <em>feel</em> like a high-end drive a lot of the time. It’s a shame that QLC flash isn’t holding its discount due to enterprise demand because this drive at an optimal price level would be nearly unbeatable. It’s still a drive worth keeping an eye on.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-specifications-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 Specifications</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Product</p></th><th

QLC flash can be tricky at lower capacities like 500GB, as there are fewer dies with which to interleave. Performance on this drive is best at 1TB and 2TB, but there will be much interest in the 4TB. The drive can hit up to 7,100 / 6,700 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,000K / 1,300K random read and write IOPS.</p><p>Pricing at the time of the review was a problem, though, at $54.99, $79.98, and $142.99 for the smaller SKUs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN7100</u></a> is, in fact, less expensive and, with TLC flash, is the better drive. In fact, that model is an excellent value all around. We suspect the Blue SN5100 will be adjusted below that pricing – that’s the only way the Blue and Black monikers make sense relative to one another — which would make it potentially a fantastic budget SSD.</p><p>Sandisk backs the drive with a standard five-year warranty and up to 600TB of writes per TB capacity. QLC flash tends to be rated for only about half the program/erase cycles as comparable TLC, but even then the endurance is sufficient for this many writes. Usually but not always QLC drives will have lower TBW but Sandisk didn't hold back here. This does not reflect actual NAND flash endurance, but rather the TBW is chosen for warranty purposes. This drive isn’t supposed to be beaten up with tons of writes, and enterprise-like workloads can and will wear the flash worse than normal consumer usage. We don’t think this write limit holds back the drive for its intended purpose in any way.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-software-and-accessories-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 Software and Accessories</h2><p>Sandisk has two downloads for its SSDs: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support-en.sandisk.com/app/answers/detailweb/a_id/31759"><u>SanDisk Dashboard</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.sandisk.com/topics/ssd/sandisk-desk-drive-getting-started"><u>Acronis True Image</u></a>.

This drive would work in a shorter form factor. The drive does have a QR code PSID, but it is otherwise uninteresting.</p><p>A 4TB SKU is on the way and is also single-sided. With current technology, such a drive would have two NAND flash packages with the standard 1Tb dies, but could theoretically get away with just one with 2Tb dies. There is a performance dip for the 4TB models, according to the datasheet, which would be either from extra memory addressing overhead with the latter solution or an abundance of dies in the former. WD could also choose to use 2Tb dies with two NAND flash packages to take advantage of better yields. One reason to stick with a single package is if there is intent for shorter form factors in an OEM counterpart, particularly as such drives tend to be single-sided.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN7100</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN8100</u></a> use the TLC version of this flash and show no performance loss at their maximum capacities at the time of our reviews, but we know the controllers are able to handle that many 1Tb dies without an issue. The Black SN7100 has been updated with a 4TB SKU post-review, which does exhibit a similar performance drop as the SN5100, and in that case, it’s due to the use of so many 1Tb dies. To condense this into something understandable: you are going to see some level of performance loss at the highest capacity of these drives. That may impact the upcoming 8TB Black SN8100 as well, unless Sandisk has a trick up its sleeve.

This is a simple four-channel DRAM-less controller made to optimally run with 16 dies at 2400 MT/s, which translates to 2TB at 7+ GB/s. BiCS8 is rated for up to 3,600 MT/s, but this is not needed for PCIe 4.0. For PCIe 5.0, this flash with a similar controller, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/phison-e31t-es-2tb-review"><u>Phison E31T</u></a>, can hit up to at least 10 GB/s. There are advantages other than bandwidth for running at a higher I/O speed, such as slightly better latency. However, running at a lower clock is more power-efficient. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> demonstrates this well by having the best power efficiency we’ve seen to date.</p><p>The Blue SN5100 differs from the Black SN7100 by its use of QLC rather than TLC flash. In practice, this isn’t as big a deal as it sounds. In pSLC mode, the flash will perform similarly, and QLC often has optimizations for reads, which might come from native flash. You might never notice a difference between the two. QLC flash does have lower endurance with approximately half the rated amount, depending on the flash and quality, but this is still an immense amount of writes that 99% of users won’t ever hit. Nevertheless, performance concerns do remain for the worst-case, which cannot be denied. We cover this in our write saturation test.</p><p>QLC flash <em>should</em> be more affordable as a trade-off, but this often has not been the case. One reason is that enterprise demand for QLC flash is higher than ever to handle large data with far better response times than a mechanical HDD provides. This has gotten worse with the AI and LLM booms, especially considering that the YMTC flash, which could alleviate this shortfall to some degree, has been politically problematic for the U.S.</p><p>Most inexpensive 4TB drives with QLC use YMTC flash, in fact, while Micron is holding back its QLC for enterprise and its own drives. That would include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P310</u></a> and the OEM Micron 2600. Historically, BiCS has not made a big splash with QLC flash and has been mostly only available in TLC. This completely changes with the Blue SN5100 as a follow-up to the Blue SN5000.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p><h2 id="comparison-products-7">Comparison Products</h2><p>The Blue SN51000 must be understood within the context of Sandisk’s own SSD product stack.

It’s right up there with the T500 and P310. It should perform close to the Black SN7100, and it does, because both drives are using very similar hardware. In any pSLC mode – and most benchmarks fall into this category, as does the vast majority of real-world drive use – the drives should perform identically. If you’re using a drive as your primary boot device and tend to have that main drive very full, the results will likely differ from this. In that case, the SN7100, with TLC flash, would be the better choice, and that goes for the T500 with DRAM as well. The 990 EVO Plus is also a good choice for that over the QLC-based options. All three drives now come with a 4TB option, which reduces the QLC advantage.</p><p>It’s important to recognize that even though our results aren’t falsely optimistic, we do prepare the drives to get more realistic data before testing. There are many scenarios and edge cases where performance differences between drives will be different and more exaggerated. To condense that down, know your workloads and usage patterns, and apply that to our data. If your drive isn’t heavily used and is well-maintained, then the SN5100 <em>will</em> perform in the best of its class. If not, it may be lower on this list. That consideration must play into your purchase decision, as you can save a significant amount of money over the T500 for an effectively identical experience most of the time.</p><h2 id="console-testing-playstation-5-transfers-7">Console Testing — PlayStation 5 Transfers</h2><p>The PlayStation 5 is capable of taking one additional PCIe 4.0 or faster SSD for extra game storage.

While QLC flash technically has higher latency than TLC, long-term reads will not come from the temporary pSLC cache; optimizations and software bottlenecks have made this moot. As you saw in our 3DMark and PCMark 10 sections, the Blue SN5100 is quite capable of being a responsive drive in normal situations. If this drive is priced right at higher capacities, we see it as an absolute win for console users, especially as the drive runs cool without any modification.</p><h2 id="transfer-rates-diskbench-7">Transfer Rates — DiskBench</h2><p>We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom, 50GB dataset.

Due to how flash operates, reads will be faster than writes, so you can usually gauge the copy speed from just the write speed. Smaller transfers, including this 50GB dataset, will usually be fully in the pSLC cache, so the results here are under ideal circumstances. We have to mention that, as the Blue SN5100 is a QLC-based drive, and larger transfers with a fuller drive can and will copy more slowly.</p><p>With that out of the way, we see the T500 come out on top, with the Blue SN5100 impressively coming in second. It performs effectively the same as the Black SN7100, which is not surprising given that the two drives use very similar hardware. The T500 utilizes six-plane flash and features DRAM, making it difficult to beat here. The P310 uses the same generation of Micron flash, but in QLC with just four planes. BiCS8 is also a four-plane design, which may be one reason it has better latency, while Micron’s newest flash is more bandwidth-focused. This includes the newest QLC flash – we’re working on getting a Micron 2600 sample so we can better elaborate on this.</p><p>If you lean more towards latency and especially power efficiency, then the Blue SN5100 makes a lot of sense. It puts the P310 in its place, and the latency gap might only grow with Micron’s newer QLC flash. Then again, the 2600 has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/micron-2600-qlc-ssd-uses-flexible-caching-to-offer-tlc-like-performance-7-200-mb-s-reads-and-6-500-mb-s-writes-push-the-limits-of-pcie-4-0" target="_blank"><u>flexible caching,</u></a> which breaks this discussion wide open once we get to PCIe 5.0. It’s just difficult to recommend the P310 over the Blue SN5100 at the same price when the latter is just better balanced in hardware in our opinion. That’s saying something because the P310 is already an immensely popular drive that hit all the right notes in our review.</p><h2 id="synthetic-testing-atto-crystaldiskmark-7">Synthetic Testing — ATTO / CrystalDiskMark</h2><p>ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products.

smoothly with only minor dips at 2MiB for read and write workloads in the ATTO benchmark. The Black SN7100, in comparison, retains its curve at the highest block sizes for reads. This could be due to differences in the QLC and TLC flash, respectively. We do have to point out that the P310, on the whole, is more consistent here, although it’s unlikely you will be transferring data at very specific sizes.</p><p>We’ve already seen in DiskBench that a real-world transfer favors the Blue SN5100. Moreover, at the typical 1MB block size in CrystalDiskMark, the Blue SN5100 offers excellent sequential performance regardless of queue depth. You will be able to eke out more with the Black SN7100’s TLC flash for writes, though. If we have to leave a caveat here, it’s this: we’re only looking at 2TB+ performance, and at lower capacities, the P310 should perform more favorably.</p><p>For latency, we see that BiCS8’s ability to be in a class of its own for QD1 random 4K reads carries over to the QLC version of the flash. It’s not as good as the TLC on the Black SN7100, but it’s darn good compared to the rest of the drives on this list. If this is the metric you care about most, then you can probably stop reading here and be satisfied in picking up one of the two WD drives. You would still have to read the entire review to see where to buy one over the other, though.</p><p>For write latency, we see these fall behind the P310, Rocket 4, and T500. The T500 is understandable as it’s using DRAM, and the Rocket 4 is using BiCS6 TLC flash with the excellent Phison E27T controller. The one result that might confuse is the P310, but we are reminded that Micron’s 232-Layer QLC flash on the drive is four-plane with optimizations for this kind of workload. Writes are usually in pSLC mode, so performance can be deceptive. To be fair to the P310, this result bolsters its application as a primary or singular drive, where frequent updates may be common. That said, we think any one of these drives would be adequate for everyday use.</p><h2 id="sustained-write-performance-and-cache-recovery-7">Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery</h2><p>Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache, which is a fast area of pseudo-SLC (single-bit) programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the "native" TLC (three-bit) or QLC (four-bit) flash. Performance can suffer even more if the drive is forced to fold, which is the process of migrating data out of the cache in order to free up space for further incoming data.</p><p>We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds. This process shows the performance of the drive in various states as well as the steady state write performance.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is a hybrid pSLC cache, meaning that the cache has both static and dynamic portions. This is similar to Samsung’s TurboWrite technology. The static portion lies outside of user space and is, as a result, is relatively small, but this cache is always available regardless of the amount of data stored on the drive. Being separate from the rest of the flash and cache, it provides a way to handle smaller and random writes in a portion of the drive that usually has much higher endurance. It also helps defer or combine writes in a way that reduces overall wear. The dynamic portion of the cache, on the other hand, will vary in size with the amount of data stored on the drive. The maximum cache size will also vary with overall drive capacity.</p><p>In our testing, the 2TB SKU of the Blue SN5100 was able to write at 6.45 GB/s for over 78 seconds. The cache is over 500GB, which is close to the maximum amount possible for a 2TB drive of QLC flash. QLC flash operates in a 4-bit mode, while the pSLC cache operates in a 1-bit mode; therefore, the cache is necessarily at most one-quarter the size of all flash.</p><p>The full amount of flash on a drive is more than is available to the user, and there must be accounting for the decimal versus binary capacity discrepancy. It’s likely that having a static portion for caching reduces the amount available for the dynamic portion, in part because the controller does need extra space for system functions and to have free blocks for future writes. Sandisk also appears capable of performing some magic with caching, given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Black SN8100's</u></a> high steady-state write performance.</p><p>If, for some reason, you exhaust the cache, the drive is then forced to write directly to the QLC flash and/or will hit a slower folding state where it must wait for flash to be moved over from the cache in order to free up needed space. This yields a steady state write rate of 442 MB/s, which is low but not bad for QLC flash. The other QLC-based drives in our test did worse, including the P310, except for the Blue SN5000, which has more dies to work with at 4TB. The Black SN7100 is less than double the Blue SN5100’s speed, but we don’t know the raw difference in flash speed. Usually, TLC flash is about 2.5 to 3 times faster than QLC, but both of these drives are using very large caches and are no doubt tuned differently than the eight-channel, DRAM-equipped Black SN8100.</p><p>To bring things back into focus: this drive is slow when the cache is full, but it’s still fast enough to hang with SATA SSDs. You shouldn’t really be getting to that point with a budget drive. However, if you care about sustained performance, there are many better drives available. You always want to be looking for TLC flash in that case, and usually smaller caches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/the-crucial-p510-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P510</u></a> is almost a perfect example, even though it’s four-channel and DRAM-less. You want DRAM and eight channels for the heaviest tasks. That’s <em>not</em> the audience for the Blue SN5100, though. This drive is made for light use, for laptops, as a gaming drive, etc. It has enough performance here for that, even in suboptimal conditions.</p><h2 id="power-consumption-and-temperature-7">Power Consumption and Temperature</h2><p>We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider, especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ultrabooks-premium-laptops"><u>best ultrabooks</u></a> can have mediocre stock storage. Desktops may be more performance-oriented with less support for power-saving features, so we show the worst-case.</p><p>Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt, or efficiency, is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload, but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly, ultimately saving energy.</p><p>For temperature recording we currently poll the drive’s primary composite sensor during testing with a ~22°C ambient. Our testing is rigorous enough to heat the drive to a realistic ceiling temperature.</p><div class="inlinegallery

This is something we may continue to do moving forward with datasheets that indicate this information. Generally, we prefer to look at our real-world results, but in this case, Sandisk lists both read and write average power use – 4.1W for each on the 2TB. Our write-heavy testing peaked at 4.12W with an average of around 3W. As far as we’re concerned, that means Sandisk is bang-on with their data. The S.M.A.R.T. reading indicates the drive can peak up to 5W, but this information is not always reliable, and we tend to measure peaks at a more realistic value.</p><p>The Blue SN5100 is, as expected, fantastically power-efficient. There’s no question this drive is a great choice if you are at all worried about power draw or thermal output. The controller in use here is not the most efficient design on paper, but Sandisk’s ability to tune it for a specific purpose makes for a great pairing with the very power-efficient BiCS8 flash. This flash isn’t running full bore, and this is a PCIe 4.0 drive, so that does help to some degree, but PCIe 5.0 drives can finish our workload faster and do quite well. Consider that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/sandisk-wd-black-sn8100-2tb-ssd-review"><u>Sandisk WD Black SN8100</u></a> is on par in power efficiency with the Blue SN5100. This demonstrates how effective optimization can be when you tune with scalable hardware.</p><p>Our test bench will run cooler than many systems – the ambient would be higher with heavy CPU and GPU loads in an enclosed case, depending on the cooling solution – but it’s still a predictable way to compare different drives. The Blue SN5100 hit a maximum temperature of 53°C during our write test, which is approximately 37°C below the serious throttling point. This drive is simply a gold mine for laptop and HTPC users, and for full-length capable portable computer systems users. Many, if not most, of these are still running PCIe 4.0 slots will have read-heavy workloads, which favors QLC flash just fine. This might be better as a secondary drive for a serious desktop PC build, though.</p><h2 id="test-bench-and-testing-notes-7">Test Bench and Testing Notes</h2><div ><table><caption>Test Bench and Testing Notes</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>CPU</strong></p></td><td

Unless noted, we use active cooling for all SSDs.</p><h2 id="sandisk-wd-blue-sn5100-bottom-line-2">Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 Bottom Line</h2><p>It wasn’t that long ago that we gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review"><u>Crucial P310</u></a> a 4/5 star rating, which is exceptional for a budget-oriented, QLC-based SSD. We do judge drives both relatively and absolutely, which means that sometimes the score may seem out of place. The Blue SN5100 is one such situation where it feels better than the P310 on the whole, but nothing in its DNA screams that it’s a 4.5 drive. One reason for this is that the Blue SN5100 right now is priced far too high to make it competitive with the fast-selling P310. Another reason is that you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-black-sn7100-ssd-review"><u>Black SN7100</u></a> with TLC flash at a very good price. We gave <em>that </em>drive a 3/5 because its performance was frankly last-gen, but in lieu of the price trends that came after – with QLC flash especially being less competitive – you could put it above the P310 and Blue SN5100.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

At an appropriate price point, it simply <em>is</em> the better drive. Most users will never experience its slowest state – which, to be honest, isn’t even that bad – and it’s one cool customer. You can integrate it into any system and expect good results without needing to adjust cooling or other settings. That’s also true of the Black SN7100, but we feel that the Blue SN5100 is a better fit for its specific market segment. It’s a great secondary or game drive at up to 4TB, and when the pricing is corrected – WD and Sandisk have been aggressive here recently – it should deliver an experience equal to the Black SN7100 at a lower price. That’s why this drive gets a higher score.</p><p>If you want TLC flash, you would go with the Black SN7100, right? Well, frankly, there are better TLC-based drives like the Rocket 4 if you actually are worried about sustained write performance, for instance. The Black SN7100’s greatest strength is its power efficiency, which is great for laptops but less meaningful in desktops. Its saving grace is that it’s priced so aggressively. On an even field, it’s simply an average drive overall. And the market agrees with us because not only is Crucial’s P310 selling well, but there is a history of “cheap” drives selling well going back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-p3-plus-ssd-review-capacity-on-the-cheap"><u>P3 Plus</u></a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-p2-m-2-nvme-ssd"><u>P2</u></a> before that. People want inexpensive drives. We think the P310 delivers on that, but if prices are equal, we would favor the Blue SN5100, so take that into consideration.</p><p>If you want this general range of performance with power efficiency but demand DRAM, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/crucial-2tb-t500-ssd-review"><u>Crucial T500</u></a> remains the way to go. It has some issues with sustained writes, which, if important to you, means you should consider something more high-end, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn850x-ssd-review-back-in-black" target="_blank"><u>WD Black SN850X</u></a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/samsung-990-pro-ssd-review" target="_blank"><u>Samsung 990 Pro</u></a>. Drives based on Phison’s E18 also apply, but recent reports of firmware-caused sluggishness persist. The good news is that Phison has fixed firmware coming to its drives. If you’re looking the other way to even cheaper drives, then there are still mid-range champions like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn770-ssd-review"><u>WD Black SN770</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/wd-sn5000-4tb-ssd-review/2"><u>Blue SN5000</u></a>, but they must be less expensive to make sense. Many other drives in that segment have varying hardware, which can be unpredictable.</p><p>Aside from competing for a spot on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" target="_blank"><u>Best SSDs list</u></a>, we can confidently state that the Blue SN5100 is impressive on its own. BiCS8 flash continues to exceed our expectations in performance, especially latency, and power efficiency alike. Sandisk’s controllers also remain well-optimized and reliable. This is the perfect type of QLC-based drive you could ask for, without any real weaknesses. Even the caching is pretty solid. Our only <em>real </em>complaint is price. This drive has to come back down to earth. If it can do that, then we can highly recommend it as the best in its class.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html"><strong>Best SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html"><strong>Best External SSDs</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck"><strong>Best SSD for the Steam Deck</strong></a></p>

<![CDATA[ OpenAI makes flurry of deals in drive towards for-profit model — AI giant teams up with Nvidia, Luxshare, Apple, and more ]]>
<p>Following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/uk-cosies-up-to-big-tech-with-usd42-billion-data-center-and-ai-investment-deal">joint announcements of major UK investments last week</a>, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has kicked off this one with a slew of new deals to enhance its own capabilities and increase its valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The company struck a deal for Nvidia hardware worth upwards of $100 billion, a deal with Chinese firm Luxsure to begin building consumer AI devices, and there are several negotiations said to be ongoing with other Chinese Apple suppliers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/apple-supplier-luxshare-shares-pop-10percent-on-report-of-openai-hardware-deal.html" target="_blank">according to CNBC</a>.</p><p>The story of OpenAI in 2025 has been one of aggressive expansion and incredibly optimistic projections about where the industry is headed and the significant role OpenAI is expected to play in it. Despite the company being structured as a non-profit and its yearly revenue projections topping out at just under $13 billion (following a $5 billion loss in 2024), it has announced investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure. These include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-oracle-ink-deal-to-build-massive-stargate-data-center-total-project-will-power-2-million-ai-chips-stargate-partner-softbank-not-involved-in-the-project">US-based Stargate scheme</a> and the Stargate UK project, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-it-will-expand-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-to-the-uae-starting-with-a-1gw-cluster">amongst other international investments</a>.</p><p>For these kinds of investments to be possible, OpenAI needs to restructure as a for-profit company, which it can now do after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-microsoft-reach-an-understanding-over-ongoing-contract-negotiations-but-agi-clause-remains-an-uncertainty">recent progress in its Microsoft negotiations</a>. It also needs the cash generated from a potential IPO, with some estimates already valuing the company at over $500 billion, despite its lack of any kind of actual profitability.</p><p>In reality, the bulk of that valuation comes from the confidence of other major tech companies. Microsoft is already one of the largest OpenAI investors, but now Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI too. Though that may well be a form of circuitous, parasitic relationship where Nvidia invests money in OpenAI, so it can, in turn, purchase Nvidia hardware for its various data center projects.</p><p>Crucially, however, this deal also marks OpenAI as one of the first customers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-enterprise-roadmap-rubin-rubin-ultra-feynman-and-silicon-photonics">Nvidia's next-generation hardware</a>. This deal will see Nvidia invest an initial $10 billion once the deal is agreed upon, with the first Nvidia hardware set to be delivered in late 2026. These chips will be Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, likely offering significant performance and efficiency advantages over existing Blackwell GPUs.</p><p>More Nvidia investment will be forthcoming as further gigawatts of computing power are set up, with the final project said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/" target="_blank">equate to around 10 gigawatts</a> of AI compute power. The electricity use alone would be enough to power over 8 million homes.</p><h2 id="ouroboros-ai-2">Ouroboros AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

"On the other hand, the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further."</p><p>Nvidia, Microsoft, Intel, OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and a range of other multi-billion and trillion-dollar companies have all announced major investments in each other's companies and services over the coming years. Although there are very real services these companies can offer each other, the kind of AI projects they all want to launch will require incredible infrastructure development, which will require Herculean levels of investment. This raises concerns about whether the funds will be available when the time comes to actually pay up.</p><p>There is the very real potential of the AI industry becoming an unsustainable bubble. When those have burst in the past, they tend to take entire companies with them.
If anything like that happens before OpenAI (and others) can realize their goals, they could be left with enormous promises and balance sheets that are deep in the red.</p><h2 id="a-physical-path-to-profitability-2">A physical path to profitability</h2><p>Alongside its drive towards IPO cash generation, OpenAI is also looking to diversify as it searches for a viable profit model for its soon-to-be for-profit company.

It's also alleged to be in talks with Goertek, a Chinese company that builds Apple's AirPods and other smart devices.</p><p>In a more tangible endeavour, it's now struck a deal with fellow Chinese Apple supplier, Luxshare, to build a smart-speaker-like device to use with ChatGPT. Similar to the smart speakers made by Apple, Amazon, and Google for their Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant smart assistants, OpenAI sees ChatGPT as a direct competitor for these kinds of tools and seems set to build out smart devices that can leverage the technology in a more physical sense.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-raids-apple-hardware-talent-manufacturing-partners" target="_blank"><em>The Information</em></a>, Luxshare is already working on prototypes with a plan to launch a viable gadget in late 2026 or early 2027.</p><p>OpenAI previously partnered with Apple product-design icon, Jony Ive, lending further credence to the idea of OpenAI pivoting towards hardware as a potential avenue towards increasing both its profitability and physical presence in people's everyday lives.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Nvidia wants to make it clear that, despite any deals it's done with certain companies to provide future hardware, it will still ensure all customers get access to next-generation GPUs, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/nvidia-to-invest-100-billion-in-openai-in-ai-computing-buildout" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.

<![CDATA[ MediaTek reportedly mulling US chip production — could use TSMC's Arizona fab to avoid tariff fallout ]]>
<p>MediaTek is negotiating production of certain chips in the U.S. with TSMC in a bid to meet customer requirements for locally manufactured components. While the plan is still under evaluation, if MediaTek manages to place orders through TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona, it will be the first non-American company to demand production of its chips at the site. While chips made by TSMC in the U.S. are more expensive than those fabbed in Taiwan, U.S. production may enable MediaTek to address certain customers and/or avoid potential tariffs.</p><p>Word of MediaTek's intentions comes from the company's Corporate Vice President JC Hsu, reports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/taiwan-s-mediatek-in-talks-with-tsmc-to-make-chips-in-arizona">Nikkei</a>. The plans target two specific categories: automotive parts and chips tied to more regulated or strategically sensitive applications. The move is said to comply with demands from American clients who favor domestic production for logistical and policy-related reasons. Hsu stressed that the deal has not been formally inked yet.</p><p>Unfortunately, the high-ranking executive of MediaTek never revealed when the company plans to produce chips at TSMC's Fab in Arizona or which process technology it intends to use. To that end, it is unclear what exactly MediaTek plans to make. Perhaps the company is ensuring that it can place orders with TSMC U.S. in case it has clients that demand production in America, or there is insufficient capacity in Taiwan. Apparently, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-amd-and-mediatek-reportedly-among-tsmcs-2nm-early-adopters-company-said-to-have-15-customers-lined-up-for-new-process-tech">over a dozen companies interested in making chips on TSMC's N2</a> fabrication process, so it might be crucial for a big company like MediaTek to secure a portion <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmc-to-build-30-percent-of-its-2nm-and-more-advanced-chips-in-the-u-s-to-speed-up-fab-21-build-out">of TSMC's N2-capable capacity that is set to be located in the USA</a>.</p><p>However, whether MediaTek can produce automotive-grade chips at TSMC's Arizona fab (Fab 21) depends on multiple factors — the most critical of which is whether TSMC Fab 21 is compliant with the automotive quality management standard IATF 16949, or at least capable of supporting customers that are. As of now, TSMC Arizona has not publicly disclosed IATF 16949 certification, and the fab was initially focused on consumer and AI/HPC processors using N5 and N4 processes. Without formal IATF 16949 compliance — or documented automotive-qualified production flow — it would be difficult for MediaTek or any other chip designer to use this fab for safety-critical automotive products, especially for applications requiring AEC-Q100 qualified components.</p><p>While MediaTek itself does not necessarily need to be IATF 16949 certified, it must ensure that all entities in its supply chain — including process technology, foundry, OSAT, and others — meet the necessary automotive quality and traceability requirements. TSMC offers N5A, N4A, and N3A process technologies that are tailored for automotive applications, so they may include relaxed rules to boost yield and reliability, and production on these nodes usually involves tighter SPC (statistical process control) and defect detection. However, we do not know whether Fab 21 supports such flows.</p><p>That said, unless TSMC Arizona eventually adopts or mirrors the automotive-grade flows of the foundry's Taiwan fabs, it is unlikely that MediaTek could produce fully automotive-qualified silicon there for anything other than non-safety-critical infotainment or connectivity chips. For advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), powertrain, or battery management chips that require ISO 26262 and ASIL certifications, MediaTek would either need to wait for TSMC Arizona to offer certified flows or continue to rely on TSMC's mature automotive fabs in Taiwan.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>Tech industry giants OpenAI and Nvidia <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/">have announced</a> a pivotal partnership, which will deploy 10 gigawatts worth of AI datacenters and $100 billion in investments.</p><p>OpenAI has committed to creating multiple datacenters with Nvidia as its "preferred strategic compute and networking partner," with the first one expected to deploy in the second half of 2026. The partnership will see OpenAI construct fervently until the total combined power budget of those datacenters reaches "at least" 10 gigawatts. For its part, Nvidia dove into its war chest to secure $100 billion, returning the favor by progressively investing in OpenAI, presumably via share purchases.</p><p>Additionally, and perhaps most interestingly, both companies commit to "co-optimize" their respective roadmaps. It's not hard to imagine that the hands of Nvidia's AI clients already guide the chipmaker's designs, but this statement could imply that OpenAI will have a bigger say in Nvidia's plans than before.</p><p>The companies also point out that the new collaboration dovetails nicely with the existing agreements with the likes of Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank. OpenAI is already the exclusive AI partner for Microsoft, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-announces-worlds-most-powerful-ai-data-center-315-acre-site-to-house-hundreds-of-thousands-of-nvidia-gpus-and-enough-fiber-to-circle-the-earth-4-5-times">promised in January</a> to invest $80 billion in the technology.</p><p>Meanwhile, OpenAI's Sam Altman remarks that "compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future", a statement that would seem more like hyperbole a mere two or three years ago.</p><p>OpenAI's next datacenters will use Nvidia's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-announces-rubin-gpus-in-2026-rubin-ultra-in-2027-feynam-after">Vera Rubin platform</a> (and presumably Rubin Ultra), powerful accelerators packing 76 TB of HBM4 memory that should be capable of performing FP4 inference at 3.6 exaflops and FP8 training at 1.2 exaflops. The fact that the "exa" prefix is becoming commonplace is exciting and scary in equal measures.</p><p>The Rubin GPU and Vera CPUs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-rubin-gpu-and-vera-cpu-data-center-ai-platforms-begin-tape-out-both-chips-in-fab-and-on-track-for-2026">taped out</a> in late August and are now being manufactured in TSMC facilities. Meanwhile, Rubin Ultra is expected to deliver 15 exaflops of FP4 operations for inference, and 5 exaflops of FP4 for training. These figures come by way of 365 TB of HBM4e memory and 14 GB300 GPUs.</p><p>To put the 10-gigawatt figure into perspective, a contemporary U.S. nuclear power plant reactor is suitable for around 1 gigawatt, meaning these new datacenters will gobble up 10 reactors' worth of juice to do their thing. That's a concept that's hard to wrap one's head around. While the technological advancement is definitely impressive, it also raises hard questions about its environmental costs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ Intel, AMD, and MediaTek reportedly among TSMC's 2nm early adopters — company said to have 15 customers lined up for new process tech ]]>
<p>TSMC has landed orders from approximately 15 customers to make chips on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-2nm-n2-process-node-enters-production-this-year-a16-and-n2p-arriving-next-year">N2 (2nm-class) manufacturing process</a>, according to a claim made by a high-ranking executive from KLA, a major wafer fab equipment (WFE) maker. The majority of clients to use TSMC's 2nm-class production node are developers of processors for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which, in TSMC's definition, spans from PCs to game consoles and data centers.</p><p>"The N2 node has 15 or so customers doing designs," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ir.kla.com/news-events/ir-calendar/event/goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025">said</a> Ahmad Khan, President of KLA's combined product and customer organization, Semiconductor Products and Customers, at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2025. "At N2, you have got 10-ish high-performance compute customers doing designs. […] We think the N2 node will probably be the largest over the first three years or so, node from an overall design point of view."</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The development has resulted in a considerably higher number of new tape-outs (NTOs) during the first and second years of availability. However, TSMC has never disclosed the actual number of customers. Instead, the company traditionally focuses on the relative number of designs.</p><p>While the President of KLA's Semiconductor Products and Customers division only mentions N2, he likely refers to the whole family of N2-branded fabrication technologies — including N2, N2P, and N2X manufacturing processes — which will ramp over the next few years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

On the other hand, Intel disclosed that some of its codenamed Nova Lake processors, due to be released next year, will rely on a foundry node, which is rumored to be N2. Broadcom and Qualcomm will almost certainly jump on the N2 bandwagon rather sooner than later, as advantages offered by the technology — enabled by gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, revamped power delivery, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-2nm-nodes-get-nanoflex-n2p-loses-backside-power-delivery">NanoFlex</a> — both for data center and mobile processors are too appealing to ignore.</p><p>The increased number of clients and designs for the N2 fabrication process in the first year are two reasons why TSMC is going to ramp up three N2-capable fabs over the next several quarters in Taiwan and is speeding up building N2-capable Fab 21 module 3 in Arizona.</p><p>We have reached out to TSMC to confirm the number of N2 clients, but the company has yet to respond.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ The Taliban begins implementing fiber optic internet ban to ‘prevent immorality’ in Afghanistan — swathes of the country plunged into cyberspace darkness ]]>
<p>Afghanistan’s fiber networks are being disconnected by the governing Taliban. The reason for the ban on fast internet connectivity is to “prevent immorality,” according to a Taliban spokesman, as quoted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.sky.com/story/taliban-orders-complete-ban-on-fibre-optic-internet-in-northern-afghanistan-as-reports-says-order-will-be-enforced-nationwide-13432773">Sky News</a>.

Internet Observatory organization NetBlocks was quick to observe drastic declines in internet connectivity in several parts of Afghanistan. If you expand the above Tweet, you can see internet connectivity in Helmand, Kandahar, Kunduz, and Balkh drop off a cliff starting from around September 15.</p><p>Some sources report that mobile networks are still operational in the provinces where the fiber services have been cut. However, this wireless alternative is slow and expensive.</p><p>While the shuttering of fiber networks seems to have started in the north of the country, local media reports indicate that the fiber ban will be rolled out nationwide.</p><p>The Taliban spokesman quoted in the intro indicated that “an alternative will be built within the country for necessities.” This may suggest a network with pared-back bandwidth, possibly to allow easy communications, without the fast fiber-enabled transmission of high-quality streaming video, and so on. Alternatively, a plan to implement a tightly controlled domestic-only internet system, as used by the likes of North Korea, might be under consideration.</p><p>Some Afghans have protested the “complete ban” on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/japan-achieves-staggering-402-tbs-data-rate-with-commercial-optical-fiber-record-breaking-performance-tapped-into-unused-wavelength-bands">fiber internet</a> that is in the midst of being implemented. Sky News quotes business owners who are very concerned about the effects of the internet restrictions. Of course, banks, online traders, and media organizations could all face dire effects.

<![CDATA[ FSR 4 modded to run on RDNA 2 GPUs improves image quality by "leaps and bounds," but carries 10% performance penalty —AMD's leaked source code turns into modding frenzy ]]>
<p>Last month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-accidentally-marks-fsr-4-open-source-source-code-reveals-potential-support-for-older-radeon-gpus" target="_blank">AMD accidentally made FSR 4 open-source</a> by publishing the entire source code on GitHub, as part of its FidelitySDK. That pushed modders to quickly reverse-engineer how to run FSR 4 on previously incompatible hardware, but the hacks were limited to Linux. That changed just last week when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/radeon/comments/1nhkkr8/fsr_sdk_leak_contained_fsr_4_files_that_work_on/" target="_blank">u/AthleteDependent926 on Reddit </a>figured out how to make it work on Windows — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/latest-fsr-4-source-code-leak-lets-you-run-amds-ai-upscaling-tech-on-nearly-any-gpu-no-linux-required" target="_blank">we saw a 12-20% decrease in potential performance with it</a>, and today new findings on older RDNA GPUs corroborate our testing.</p><p>There are actually three aspects to this story: first, we have an RX 6800 XT that showed a noticeable uptick in visual fidelity at the cost of FPS; secondly, Computer Base tested a bunch of GPUs that saw similar declines in performance; lastly, a Reddit user also tried FSR 4 on their RX 6950 XT and praised its image quality while noting fewer frames achived compared to XeSS. The focal point of the story, though, is the large overhead FSR 4 brings with it, even if it offers a much better-looking image than its predecessor.</p><p>User <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chiphell.com/forum.php?extra=page%3D1&mobile=no&mod=viewthread&tid=2744798&utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">kkrace on Chiphell</a> managed to get FSR 4 running on an RX 6800 XT, which is an RDNA 2 graphics card that lacks the proper hardware needed for FSR 4. As such, they saw only 100-107 FPS in <em>Stellar Blade</em> when using FSR 4, compared to 110+ FPS on FSR 3. Even though that's only a ~3-10% decrease, the user claims they saw 10-20% worse frame rates; however, the image quality was significantly better. Therefore, they suggest switching to FSR 4 regardless, because, at triple-digit FPS, you might as well take the slight performance hit for majorly upgraded visuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

The guide to do that was posted later on Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1nmyhpo/fsr_4_on_rdna_2_guide/" target="_blank">by user u/NaM_77,</a> who listed an older driver as a prerequisite. They tested it using their RX 6950 XT and, while no comparison numbers with FSR 3 were provided, the RX 6950 XT still gained about 10% more frames with FSR 4 when tallied against native (TAA) results. Intel's XeSS, on the other hand, had even better performance, but the user highlighted that it was unstable and not as good-looking.</p><p>These sentiments are echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/artikel/grafikkarten/anleitung-fsr-4-auf-radeon-rx-7000-rdna-3.94373/" target="_blank">Computer Base's testing,</a> which didn't use an RDNA 2 GPU. Rather, they pitted an RX 7900 XTX against an RX 9070 XT — AMD's latest flagship purpose-built with FSR 4 in mind. Surprisingly, it still underperformed compared to FSR 3. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, tested at 4K Ultra settings, the 9070 XT netted 77 FPS using FSR 3.1 and only 74 FPS using FSR 4. More importantly, though, the RDNA 3-based 7900 XTX saw 16% fewer frames in FSR 4 compared to FSR 3.1, but again justified that with markedly better visuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure

Modders were able to tweak FSR 4 to run INT8 libraries, which themselves have a noticeable discrepancy between each other.

FSR 4 is supposed to only work on RX 9000 series GPUs, but modders were quick to figure out how to run it on older RDNA graphics cards when AMD accidentally published the entire source code on GitHub. Several users have since tested their GPUs with tweaked DLLs, with all results pointing toward improved visuals at the cost of worse FPS.

<![CDATA[ Samsung earns Nvidia certification for its HBM3 memory — stock jumps 5% as company finally catches up to SK hynix and Micron in HBM3E production ]]>
<p>Samsung's 12-layer HBM3E chips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202509190008">have passed</a> Nvidia's qualification tests for use in high-end AI accelerators. The Korean giant's stock price immediately jumped over 5% following the news, as the certification means Samsung is catching up to SK hynix and Micron, both of which were already selling HBM3E chips to Nvidia.</p><p>The welcome development comes around 18 months after HBM3E's development was complete, and after multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/samsung-hbm3e-chips-reportedly-fail-to-meet-nvidias-heat-and-power-requirements">certification delays</a>. Samsung reportedly won't be selling HBM3E to Nvidia in high quantities until 2026, as current orders for the speedy chips are being fulfilled by SK hynix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ram/micron-puts-stackable-24gb-hbm3e-chips-into-volume-production-for-nvidias-next-gen-h200-ai-gpu">and Micron</a>.</p><p>According to the report, Samsung's HBM3 memory is expected to go into Nvidia DGX B300 cards in fairly short order, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-22/samsung-shares-rise-to-year-s-high-on-nvidia-quality-test-report" target="_blank">Bloomberg's industry sources expect</a> the chips will get the final Nvidia certification quite soon. As for AMD, Samsung was already selling HBM3E chips for Instinct MI350 cards, alongside Micron. HBM3 is currently the top grade of memory chips available, comprising 12 layers, up from eight in standard HBM3. This configuration results in a meaty 1.2 TB/s per stack.</p><p>While HBM3E isn't even one year old, the AI train waits for no man. All sights are already set on HBM4, a spec that doubles the chips' bus width, resulting in approximately 2 TB/s of bandwidth per stack. It's worth noting that while the JEDEC HBM4 spec asks for 8 Gbps per pin, all three major memory makers are aiming for 10 to 11 GBps per pin on production chips, reportedly due to pressure from Nvidia. Thanks to manufacturing on 3-4 nm processes (down from 10 nm), HBM4 is predicted to offer significantly higher capacity of 64 GB per chip (up from 48 GB), along with a 20 to 30% reduction in power consumption.</p><p>Samsung has been in talks with almost every AI chip maker to get an early certification for its upcoming HBM4 wares, intending to fire up volume production as soon as the first half of 2026. This particular race is currently led by SK hynix, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/sk-hynix-completes-development-of-hbm4-2-048-bit-interface-and-10-gt-s-speeds-promised">which signaled the completion</a> of its HBM4 development not even two weeks ago. Judging by Samsung's stock price jump, though, it seems investors are quite confident that the Korean maker will catch up soon enough.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<![CDATA[ China bets on DUV as EUV blockade reshapes chipmaking — but it won't dethrone ASML's advanced lithography, for now ]]>
<p>When Dutch officials <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/manufacturing/dutch-government-bans-even-simpler-chipmaking-tools-from-export-to-china-duv-lithography-tools-now-get-the-axe">revoked ASML’s license</a> to export Twinscan NXT:2050i and NXT:2100i extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems to China under U.S. pressure, it closed the door to the only machines capable of producing sub-7nm chips at scale.</p><p>That single policy decision has defined what some analysts are calling the semiconductor cold war, where SMIC and its peers cannot buy the equipment needed for modern AI accelerators, and every shipment of advanced tools is now scrutinized as if it were a weapons transfer.</p><p>What the blockade hasn’t done is stop China’s fabs. Instead, it has forced an awkward <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/17/news-smic-said-to-test-chinese-made-duv-lithography-tool-from-sicarrier-affiliate-amid-ai-chip-push/" target="_blank">reliance on older deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines (via <em>TrendForce</em>)</a> and sparked a parallel race to design local replacements. It’s a strategy of necessity, one that accepts higher costs and lower yields in exchange for continuity and independence.</p><h2 id="sanctions-and-the-scramble-for-workarounds-2">Sanctions and the scramble for workarounds</h2><p>EUV machines are some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/how-tsmc-managed-to-increase-efficiency-of-asmls-euv-tools-system-level-optimizations-and-in-house-pellicles-chipmaker-boosted-euv-driven-wafer-production-by-30x-over-six-years-while-reducing-power-consumption-by-24-percent">most complex industrial systems in existence</a>. Packed with thousands of U.S.-origin components and priced at hundreds of millions of dollars a piece, they are the foundation of every 5nm and 3nm chip shipping, or planning to ship in the future. China has none, and the U.S. has made sure of that.</p><p>Successive rounds of sanctions since 2022 have blocked not just EUV exports, but also the most advanced immersion DUV systems, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/dutch-government-retakes-export-control-over-asmls-fab-tools">including ASML’s Twinscan NXT:1970i and NXT:1980i.</a> The Netherlands and Japan joined those restrictions, and even service contracts for ASML machines installed in China are being scrutinized. ASML itself has admitted that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asml-china-worker-stole-info-about-chipmaking-tools">a China-based employee stole proprietary EUV data</a>, highlighting how valuable the technology has become.</p><p>The policy has pushed chip procurement into murky territory. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/why-nobody-is-buying-nvidia-6000d-in-china">Grey-market Nvidia GPUs</a> continue to flood in through Hong Kong and Singapore despite being explicitly banned, with seizures measured in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But smuggling a workstation card is one thing; sneaking in a 180-ton lithography scanner is another. On that front, Washington’s chokehold on export controls has held up.</p><h2 id="the-duv-fallback-plan-2">The DUV fallback plan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure

Using 193nm argon-fluoride lasers, immersion DUV systems comfortably support 28nm nodes, with yields and costs increasing dramatically as nodes shrink further. With multi-patterning (exposing the same wafer multiple times with different masks) they can be stretched down to 7nm-class geometries. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-cpu-10nm-earnings-amd,36967.html">Intel’s disastrous 10nm rollout</a> proved how costly and yield-sensitive that approach can be, but it remains the only path available to Chinese fabs.</p><p>SMIC’s Kirin 9000-class parts, built for Huawei, already demonstrate the limits of this strategy. It’s widely believed that they were fabricated with DUV and heavy use of multiple patterning. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/chipsets/huaweis-sanctions-evading-kirin-9000s-tested-significantly-behind-kirin-9000-with-tsmc-tech">The chips work</a>, but at lower volume and efficiency than anything coming out of Taiwan or South Korea.</p><p>For now, Chinese fabs are leaning on their existing ASML DUV fleets. Nearly half of ASML’s second-quarter equipment tooling shipments in 2024 went to China, despite the political pressure in Washington. Those sales are a reminder of just how dependent Beijing still is on imported tools. But the window is closing, and the focus is shifting.</p><p>Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment announced in 2023 that it had built a 28nm immersion scanner, the SSA800-10W. It’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinas-first-28nm-capable-scanner-to-be-delivered-by-end-of-2023">crude compared to ASML’s Twinscan line</a>, but it represents the first domestically developed immersion tool, and critically, it was designed without U.S. intellectual property. According to a <em>TrendForce </em>report, SMIC is testing a prototype from Yuliangsheng, a Huawei-linked affiliate of SiCarrier, which also rated for 28nm, but with ambitions to scale toward 7nm with multi-patterning.</p><p>A fully domestic DUV scanner, even if mired in yield problems, would insulate Chinese foundries from future Western policy decisions. Let’s not forget that China has previously made it clear that strategic self-sufficiency matters more than perfect parity with TSMC or Samsung.</p><h2 id="china-is-playing-the-long-game-2">China is playing the long game</h2><p>Nobody expects China’s DUV tools to rival ASML’s. The gap is at least a decade, and without EUV, the economics are punishing. Multi-patterning consumes more wafers, introduces more points of failure, and demands ever more sophisticated etch and metrology equipment to hold yields together. Every advanced chip that comes off a DUV line in Shanghai costs more than its equivalent in Hsinchu.</p><p>Even with low yields, however, a 7nm-class domestic chip is better than none at all. Huawei has already rebuilt much of its smartphone supply chain around local vendors, and state mandates now require Chinese firms to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/china-mandates-domestic-firms-source-50-percent-of-chips-from-chinese-producers-beijing-continues-to-squeeze-companies-over-reliance-on-foreign-semiconductors">source 50% of their chips domestically</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, ASML’s chief executive has said China is ten to fifteen years behind. That may be true in technology, but sanctions are accelerating the drive to close the gap. Each ban entrenches the incentive to localize, and each domestic stepper tested at SMIC or Huawei’s labs makes the next round of controls less decisive.</p><p>That is the paradox of the so-called semiconductor cold war. EUV has been locked down, but in the process, DUV has become the backbone of a new, homegrown ecosystem. For Washington, the risk is that every workaround makes China a little less dependent. And for China, the bet is that a decade of inefficiency is worth the price of eventual independence.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

U.S. pressure has cut China off from ASML’s EUV tools, forcing SMIC and peers to stretch DUV and build local scanners. It may be costly now, but it could be key to the country's road to self-reliance in semiconductor manufacturing.

<![CDATA[ Japanese city implements two-hour daily recreational smartphone usage limit — ordinance comes into effect from October 1, no enforcement or penalties proposed ]]>
<p>A draft ordinance that proposes a limit of two hours of smartphone use, outside of work or study purposes, was voted on in Toyoaki City, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, today. The ordinance passed with 12 out of 19 council members voting in favor. All local citizens should follow the new rule starting from October 1. However, “there is no enforcement or penalty in the ordinance,” reports Japan’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250922/k10014929441000.html" target="_blank">NHK</a> (machine translation).</p><p>We reported on this upcoming vote about a month ago. The news raised our interest, as Toyoaki City council would be among the first to attempt to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/phones/japanese-city-pushes-two-hour-daily-smartphone-limit-to-promote-healthier-sleep-for-its-citizens-particularly-school-age-children" target="_blank">regulate smartphone usage</a> to reap health benefits for the local population. Though the ordinance will cover all citizens of Toyoaki, there is certainly a sense that this is a ‘tool’ with which to coerce school children into reducing their free time screen time.</p><p>“Toyoaki City says that smartphones are essential for daily life, but prolonged use may affect the home environment, such as lack of sleep, and may hinder the healthy growth of children,” reports NHK. Children of school age should follow additional advice to put down their devices by 9 pm if at elementary school or younger, and by 10 pm if a junior high school student or above.</p><h2 id="arguments-for-and-against-the-ordinance-2">Arguments for and against the ordinance</h2><p>As we noted in the intro, the ordinance didn’t pass without some dissent. Naysayers on the council put forward several arguments against the proposed two-hour free time rule. One said that smartphone usage should be "determined in the context of family discipline." Another indicated that some children find important refuge from school and home life on their smartphones.</p><p>However, the majority who voted to pass the ordinance today insisted that it will help prevent device addiction. Moreover, citizens should think of it as “a gentle proposal for citizens to reconsider their lives and child-rearing,” and that is its value. Indeed, it is worth repeating, the new rule is non-binding and without penalty – and thus much more like official guidance or advice.</p><p>In a speech to the press, Mayor Toyoaki echoed this advisory sentiment, underlining that the two hours “is just a guideline.” He mused that it would be useful if citizens checked themselves for health and sleep benefits after making changes to their leisure time smartphone habits.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=" target="_blank"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.
