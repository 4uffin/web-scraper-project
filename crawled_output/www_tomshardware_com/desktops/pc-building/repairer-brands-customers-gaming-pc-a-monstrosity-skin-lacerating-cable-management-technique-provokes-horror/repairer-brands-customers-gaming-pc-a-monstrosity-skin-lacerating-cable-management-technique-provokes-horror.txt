But it isn't revealed precisely why this machine was sent into repair.

A PC repair professional was sent in a system to fix that had some unusual, and possibly hazardous, modifications. Redditor and repair shop owner, elishalewisusaf, didn‚Äôt shy away from branding the stricken PC a ‚Äúmonstrosity.‚Äù Indeed, the PSU shroud looks like it was ripped open by a xenomorph, breaking through the perforated steel venting to protect its hive.I own a tech repair business - and this monstrosity came in. I‚Äôm baffled from r/pcmasterraceCommenters in the PCMR Reddit thread are largely puzzled as to ‚Äòwhy‚Äô such a heinous act has been carried out on this PC. The PSU shroud already featured a modestly sized cutout for cable routing, just below the xenomorph breach zone. Indeed, elishalewisusaf is also ‚Äúbaffled‚Äù by what they saw when this PC arrived in the repair shop.The assembled social media-based PC building experts generally opine that the twisted metal surgery this PC has undergone, presumably by the owner, is user error, to put it politely. However, some are charitable enough to suggest the 8-pin cable from PSU to GPU may have been too short to take a more scenic route. That would mean it was an unusually short cable.

(Image credit: elishalewisusaf on Reddit)Elishalewisusaf has yet to update on what the customer-reported issue with the PC in the picture is. So, we don‚Äôt know if the twisted metal mess between the PSU zone and the rest of the PC actually caused a functional problem. It would not be surprising if some of the cabling we can‚Äôt see is damaged or shorting, due to metal shards or dust.Once a proud PC systemAlso in the image, we can see that this ailing PC once proudly brandished the Digital Storm marque. That firm claims to build PCs with ‚Äúexpert craftsmanship,‚Äù and is committed to ‚Äúcrafting the world‚Äôs most advanced gaming PCs.‚Äù It also offers lifetime support - so the PSU shroud-mangler should have reached for the phone before reaching for the bolt cutters, or whatever inappropriate tool did this damage.We‚Äôd guess that the GPU pictured is an Asus Dual GeForce RTX 3060, possibly an RTX 4060. That means, if this PC originally shipped with the GPU, it was put together around four or fewer years ago. Dust buildup looks like a few years' worth, too.Some Redditors can‚Äôt help but comment on the 256GB SATA drive we see mounted on the PSU shroud area. We‚Äôd like to think this is an old drive brought along from a prior PC, not the primary, as it lacks capacity and performance if the PC is meant for gaming duties in 2025.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

20+ years ago getting cut by your PC case was the norm even without any "custom modifications" like this üòÇ.

The cuts on the ends of the aluminum beams were pretty clean, but zero effort was made round the edges. Instead, the manufacturer simply included a pair of cotton gloves, presumably to wear while assembling it.

I agree with the commenter that it's probably a short power cable, especially if it's a cheap PSU, which going by the cheap SATA drive it probably is. But it's scary that they took the time to zip tie power cables together and didn't even take the time to make a nice, square, neat cutout and wrap some electrical tape around the edges for protection.
