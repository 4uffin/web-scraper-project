Through partnerships with retailers, our affiliate networks, and searching the web, we find the most recent ways to save on online orders, including any exclusive codes our commercial team negotiates. We then upload the latest codes & promotions to our pages, refreshing them twice a week.How we test coupon codesOur dedicated coupons team tests each code before they’re uploaded to our pages to ensure they will be accepted at the checkout. Coupons can include the likes of free shipping, student discounts, multibuy offers and more, and you’ll find applicable codes for products & services across all categories. However, we don’t list any one-time use or user-specific codes - this is to make sure each code is available for everyone who visits our site to useFor the sake of clarity, we also include key information about each coupon, such as expiry dates and any terms & conditions, on the page. We update this information whenever we become aware of any changes, with each page updated twice a week. You can read the terms & conditions for an offer by looking for the corresponding text and clicking it to expand the terms section. This text can be found near the ‘Get Code’ button. What to do if a coupon code doesn’t workDespite our team regularly refreshing our pages and testing every code before upload, every now and then a coupon may not work as intended. Retailers can change expiry dates or terms & conditions before pages can be updated, offers can expire, or a coupon can no longer be accepted. If you have any issues using one of our codes, our team is on hand to help. It’s always best to start by double-checking a code’s terms & conditions to make sure your order meets the requirements. Click “View terms and conditions” to expand the code section. Here you’ll find all available information on your chosen offer. Discounts may be product-specific (i.e. 10% off PC cases), have an associated minimum order value (i.e. spend $30 or more), or require verification (i.e. register with a valid student or workplace email address). If you comply with all listed requirements and your discount is still not being applied, send an email to our team at coupons.tomshardware@futurenet.com and we can help. Let us know which code you are trying to use and which page it’s listed on, and customer support will reply as soon as possible to assist.How we make moneyTom’s Hardware earns money from coupon pages on a commission basis. For every coupon page on our site, we have negotiated a deal with that retailer. Whenever someone places an order with that brand and applies one of our codes to their cart, we earn a percentage of the final order total back in commission. The good news? This means that we offer our codes without charging any fees. Redeeming a discount listed on Tom’s Hardware is always free - all you will need to pay is a discounted price for whatever items you want to buy. If you're looking for more information on Tom's Hardware coupons, you can also read more about How We Source Coupon Codes and How to Use Them on our dedicated page.
