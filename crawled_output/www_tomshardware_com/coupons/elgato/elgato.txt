Any orders that fall under this total will have shipping fees applied depending on what you're ordering - these will be displayed at the checkout.Can I read an Elgato review?Here at Tom's Hardware, we've tested a handful of Elgato's bits of hardware and written up our thoughts in the likes of our Elgato Facecam Pro and Elgato Stream Deck+ Review.

You'll find a number of sales running throughout the year, usually around key holiday periods such as Christmas, Prime Day and Black Friday. These sales tend to offer discounts of up to 20% off selected products, so keep an eye out for chances to save.Make the most of the marketplaceElgato marketplace is the brand's online library of digital assets, including apps and other software that can be used with your tech to optimize their performance.

Watch out for bundles during sales, especially around Black Friday.How to use Elgato discount codesTake a look through the list of Elgato discount codes you'll see at the top of this page and find one you want to use.Click "Get Code" next to the one you want to use to reveal it in a new tab.Copy the code to your clipboard, then head back to your old tab to visit the Elgato website.Start shopping for the products you want to purchase, adding them to your cart as you go.When you're ready to purchase, click on your cart to proceed to the checkout screen.Look for the field marked "Promo Code" and paste your code here.Click "Apply" and your discount should be applied to your order.How we source coupon codesTom’s Hardware has a coupons team dedicated to finding the latest and best codes for each of our pages. Through partnerships with retailers, our affiliate networks, and searching the web, we find the most recent ways to save on online orders, including any exclusive codes our commercial team negotiates. We then upload the latest codes & promotions to our pages, refreshing them twice a week.How we test coupon codesOur dedicated coupons team tests each code before they’re uploaded to our pages to ensure they will be accepted at the checkout. Coupons can include the likes of free shipping, student discounts, multibuy offers and more, and you’ll find applicable codes for products & services across all categories. However, we don’t list any one-time use or user-specific codes - this is to make sure each code is available for everyone who visits our site to useFor the sake of clarity, we also include key information about each coupon, such as expiry dates and any terms & conditions, on the page. We update this information whenever we become aware of any changes, with each page updated twice a week. You can read the terms & conditions for an offer by looking for the corresponding text and clicking it to expand the terms section. This text can be found near the ‘Get Code’ button. What to do if a coupon code doesn’t workDespite our team regularly refreshing our pages and testing every code before upload, every now and then a coupon may not work as intended. Retailers can change expiry dates or terms & conditions before pages can be updated, offers can expire, or a coupon can no longer be accepted. If you have any issues using one of our codes, our team is on hand to help. It’s always best to start by double-checking a code’s terms & conditions to make sure your order meets the requirements. Click “View terms and conditions” to expand the code section. Here you’ll find all available information on your chosen offer. Discounts may be product-specific (i.e. 10% off PC cases), have an associated minimum order value (i.e. spend $30 or more), or require verification (i.e. register with a valid student or workplace email address). If you comply with all listed requirements and your discount is still not being applied, send an email to our team at coupons.tomshardware@futurenet.com and we can help. Let us know which code you are trying to use and which page it’s listed on, and customer support will reply as soon as possible to assist.How we make moneyTom’s Hardware earns money from coupon pages on a commission basis. For every coupon page on our site, we have negotiated a deal with that retailer. Whenever someone places an order with that brand and applies one of our codes to their cart, we earn a percentage of the final order total back in commission. The good news? This means that we offer our codes without charging any fees. Redeeming a discount listed on Tom’s Hardware is always free - all you will need to pay is a discounted price for whatever items you want to buy. If you're looking for more information on Tom's Hardware coupons, you can also read more about How We Source Coupon Codes and How to Use Them on our dedicated page.
