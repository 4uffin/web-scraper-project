Dell Rewards members are eligible for free expedited delivery for specially marked products.Are Dell laptops good?Dell has been making laptops for all tasks, from work horses to gaming for decades. We at Tom's Hardware gave the Dell XPS 13 4.5 stars, thanks to its class-leading battery life and the Snapdragon X Elite processor, which delivers strong performance. We also gave the Dell G16 gaming laptop 4 stars because of its bargain price point and excellent Cherry MX keyboard.Can I get a Dell student discount?Yes, Dell offers up to 30% off for anyone in education. To qualify, you'll need to verify with a valid education email address through the Dell website. Once you've done so, you will be shown discounted items exclusive to students, which you can then add to your order.

You can manage your points by logging in to your Dell account.Do Dell products come with a warranty?Most Dell products come with a limited 1-year warranty. Some items have a warranty reaching up to 5 years. There are also options to purchase warranty extensions when checking out. If you aren’t sure what warranty policy applies to your purchase, contact Dell directly for support.What is Dell's returns policy?Customers can almost always return products purchased from the Dell web store. Eligible items can be refunded or otherwise reimbursed using in-store credit. To verify whether or not your purchase qualifies for a refund and what terms apply, contact Dell directly for assistance. If your purchase is eligible, you can send it back. Returns are completely free of charge if the product is damaged or defective. However, if you're returning an item that isn't defective or damaged, it may be subject to a restocking fee of 15%.Dell Saving TipsWatch for salesDell runs sales throughout the year, with big events around holidays and competitor sales like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday.
