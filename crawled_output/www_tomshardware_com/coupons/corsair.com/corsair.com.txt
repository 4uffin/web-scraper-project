FAQsIs Corsair a good brand?Corsair has been making high-grade PC components and peripherals for over 30 years and is a leading manufacturer of RAM. We at Tom's Hardware love Corsair, so much so that we rated the Corsair K65 Wireless Keyboard 4.5 stars thanks to its swappable keys, build quality, and iCue integration. We also rated the Corsair Scimiter Elite Wireless Mouse 4 stars due to its movable side panel, 16 programmable buttons and good battery life. And they don't just make peripherals; we gave their pre-built tower, the Corsair Vengeance i7600, four stars for its excellent gaming performance.Does Corsair offer free shipping?Yes, Corsair offers free shipping on orders over $79. If your order is less than $79, you will incur a shipping fee, which may vary depending on the item you're ordering. All added costs will be shown in your order total at checkout.Does Corsair offer warranties on its products?All new Corsair-branded products come with a minimum 2-year warranty. Some products have longer warranty times, but this varies in duration.What is Corsair XP Care?XP Care is Corsair's extended warranty option to purchase at checkout. XP Care offers device cover for 3 - 5 years and promises that a brand-new replacement device will be sent out in 2 - 3 business days if your device has any issues. All your return costs and shipping fees will be covered when you purchase XP Care, meaning you won't be hit with surprise charges and can manage your warranty online. You'll also have access to an exclusive 24/7 customer support line for XP Care customers. Claimants are entitled to two successful replacement claims per plan.What are Corsair exclusives?Some Corsair products are not available to buy through third-party sellers and can only be found on the Corsair website. These products are known as Corsair exclusives and have their own dedicated section on the brand's website. Expect to find peripherals such as mice and keyboards, PC components, and gaming PCs.What is Corsair's returns policy?Purchases from Corsair come with a 60-day return policy that begins the day the item is received. Holidays, however, have a different policy that offers a larger window depending on the circumstances of the purchase. For example, items purchased between the start of November and the middle of December usually can't be returned until at least the middle of January. Visit Corsair's website to verify the return policy of your product if you aren’t sure which policy your return falls under.Corsair Saving Tipsseasonal salesAs holidays such as Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Labor Day roll around, it’s common to find Corsair sales that bring discounts across their range. You'll sometimes see discounts around third-party events like Amazon Prime Day. These are great chances to save a fair few dollars - we've previously seen up to 60% off selected products.Weekly DealsCorsair sells discounted items daily through its website's Weekly Deals section. You'll find regular price drops on hardware, peripherals, and even some recently released Corsair products.bundlesIf you’re looking for more than one item, search for Corsair bundles. These bundles let you purchase a handful of products together at a discounted rate. Bundles can include cases, coolers, power supplies, and more.certified refurbishedIn the certified refurbished section of their website, Corsair offers a wide selection of used hardware that's been restored to like-new condition and tested to ensure high quality. These products are offered at up to 50% off the new price of their counterparts, letting you save a few dollars on your devices and even including some Corsair exclusives.student discountYou can save 15% on your Corsair orders when you verify your status with a valid UNiDAYS account.
