Permits and turbine orders point to half a gigawatt of on-site generation as xAI accelerates its Mississippi build.

xAI is moving faster than anyone expected on its power strategy. According to a new report from SemiAnalysis, Elon Musk’s AI startup already has 460MW of natural gas generation either installed or under construction, split between its Memphis campus and a new site across the border in Southaven, Mississippi.The numbers check out against state filings and local reporting. Shelby County granted xAI a permit in July for 15 stationary gas turbines at its Paul R. Lowry Road facility in Memphis after months of wrangling with environmental groups, which alleged that dozens of turbines had been running without proper approval. In Mississippi, regulators issued a 12-month authorization to operate gas turbines at 2875 Stanton Road, a property xAI acquired from Duke Energy this summer, while the company builds out a permanent plant.Equipment lists emerging from legal disclosures align with SemiAnalysis’s reporting of 12 SMT-130 turbines, rated at roughly 16MW apiece, on the Memphis side, and seven Titan 350 units in Southaven, each capable of more than 35MW. Together, that brings xAI’s on-site capacity close to half a gigawatt, or roughly the output of a midsize utility plant, stood up in less than a year.

xAI now has 460 MW of natural gas turbines installed and either operating or under construction. This includes 12 SMT-130 turbines at Colossus-1 and 7 Titan-350 turbines in Mississippi, located right across from Colossus-2. @elonmusk and @BrentM_SpaceX chose Mississippi due to… pic.twitter.com/dCTYjfK7oQSeptember 17, 2025A single Nvidia GB200 NVL72 rack is modeled at around 120-1302kW. Even after factoring in cooling and overhead, 460MW of generation translates to headroom for nearly 3,000 NVL72 racks, which is more than 200,000 GPUs in total. If xAI succeeds in doubling that to a full gigawatt, it would dwarf most hyperscale campuses in terms of concentrated GPU capacity.xAI’s choice of turbine suggests a sense of urgency behind the project. Solar’s SMT-130 and Titan 350 packages are containerized modules designed for rapid deployment, essentially acting as bridge power while xAI transitions to the larger Southaven site. That speed helps sidestep the years-long queue for new grid interconnects, but also explains the geographic shuffle — Tennessee pushback slowed the Memphis approvals, so xAI pivoted to Mississippi, where regulators moved faster.Compared with Microsoft and Amazon, which are experimenting with 100-200MW on-site projects, xAI’s goal of leaping straight to a gigawatt sets its power strategy apart from anything else. None of this means xAI is home free. The Memphis permit is already under appeal, and the Southaven authorization is temporary. Critics argue the company is prioritizing speed over compliance, which is a familiar criticism for Musk’s ventures.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Why not solar system with battery backup, Elon ?

Stomx said:Why not solar system with battery backup, Elon ?Not enough land area? Solar could compliment but likely not cover the needs of a 1 GW facility as 24/7/365 reliable power is most desirable for this application, not to mention how long it would take to have that many solar panels and huge battery banks manufactured, transported, and installed onsite.
If I recall correctly, the longer-term solution is nuclear power, possibly those SMR's (Small Modular Reactor).

Small Modular Reactors are good but USA right now buys the fuel for nuclear in Russia.
Wasn't it Elon Mask who claimed that 100x100 miles area covered by the solar panels and backed by batteries can supply all the needs of USA? The 1GW is just 1/1300 of what USA uses which means the 3x3 miles of desert land of Arizona or California can supply all he needs and show a good example how actually to become "green".
The 10x10 area will cover all the needs of all his friend billionaires and 20x20 area all his grandiose plans with 100 million GPUs for AI. And besides solar panels there exist other solutions how to collect the solar energy.
Perhaps he ordered the gas system to please President Tramp at so quickly passed times when he opened any door in WH with just his leg

If memory serves me correctly. I remember watching a documentary online showing a city near Memphis. That had residents complaining of getting cancer and related illnesses from Elon's turbines for AI.

I'm not going to take sides here, but being brutally honest, there's almost no way that anyone is developing cancer specifically from Elon's turbines. Even powerful toxins like Mercury and Lead can take a long time to manifest symptoms and things as awful as cancers in humans. However, I don't doubt other illnesses and symptoms in general showing up already, especially for those that are more sensitive to those pollutants.
Being brutally honest, it's probably mostly a simple matter of many resident not wanting that crap near their communities, which is totally understandable.

I find it absolutely amazing in this reality that investors are still willing to take part in ventures from a guy who is quite possibly drugged out of his mind.
