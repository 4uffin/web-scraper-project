This could be bad news for Nvidia.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the country’s top internet regulator, has reportedly banned its biggest tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, from buying Nvidia’s AI chips. According to the Financial Times, the CAC said that these institutions should stop testing the new RTX Pro 6000D and cancel their orders, even though several companies had already indicated their interest in purchasing tens of thousands of these GPUs, which were set to replace the H20 after it was banned (but before it was unbanned again). This goes against the initial reports that reception for the more affordable AI China-specific GPU was lukewarm — instead, it turns out that the central government was blocking the purchase of these graphics cards. This new ban comes just weeks after companies were directed to stop ordering Nvidia H20 chips, too.Beijing reportedly believes that homegrown AI chip makers, like Huawei and Cambricon, now produce chips that have comparable performance to Nvidia’s China-only products. And although Team Green might still have an advantage with its software stack, other Chinese tech giants like Tencent are pushing to build their own infrastructure to replace that. Because of these developments, China’s chip makers are ramping production in anticipation of the glut of orders coming from companies that need AI chips but can’t purchase Nvidia products.When approached for comment, Nvidia directed us to remarks made by CEO Jensen Huang in London on Wednesday morning. "We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be," adding, "I’m disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I’m understanding of that. We are patient about it. We’ll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.” Huang told reporters in London on Wednesday that he hopes to discuss Nvidia's ability to do business in China with President Trump during the latter's state visit to the UK.

This news comes soon after the country accused Nvidia of breaking its anti-monopoly law, with the chipmaker facing fines of up to 10% of its China revenue. However, some also believe that Beijing is making these moves to get a more favorable deal from the U.S. in trade negotiations, especially as export approval for its Blackwell-based B30 chips, which perform up to 80% of its latest products, is still up in the air.On the other hand, some Chinese industry leaders believe that this move is part of the central government’s effort to break free from American technology and boost its homegrown semiconductor industry. “The message is now loud and clear,” one executive told the Financial Times. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it’s all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Maybe nvidia will have time to make enough gaming GPU's again.

Let's not forget how the thinking was supposed to go:
"We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second-best stuff, not even our third-best. You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking."
- Howard Williams Lutnick, Secretary of Commerce
This government is a rare combination of incompetence and arrogance.

The irony is, by banning it w/ the explicit reason that "our chips are good enough don't worry bro", they are very much displaying that their chips are in fact not good enough to compete w/ Nvidia.

There is the factor that some of these companies are billions invested into nvdia/cuda solution and some are also have feud against Huawei. Banning Nvdia opens room for company like Alibaba who created their internal ai gpu to also consider marketing to a broader market

Which means that, in less than 3
years, we've gone from the US banning
chips exports to China to restrict its
development, to China banning US chips
Imports because they now have their
own.
Easily one of the biggest policy fckups
of the past few years.
still remember how some people 3 years
ago predicted that the export controls
neant that "China's semiconductor
nanufacturing industry was reduced to
zero overnight. Complete collapse. No
chance of survival" (look it up). When
the truth S that it's the best thing the
Americans could ever have done to
turbocharge it.

They can claim what they want but I'd bet thir stuff is no better than their Zhaoxin CPU's. And they will want CUDA, etc. That said I diagree with the export restrictions. May as well keep them reliant on US technology.

May as well keep them reliant on US technology.Certain outliers are almost a decade behind while others are basically tied with international tech. Majority I assume is 5-7 years behind which is domestically usable but not competitive. Agree that export restrictions don't work too well. If AI/Compute is such a world changer, then the primary contraint is electricity, not GPUs at this point. GPU/tech restrictions would have worked a decade ago but the cats out of the bag now.

It does not matter that your supercomputer is 2x slower if you can compensate that with 2x more access time or more advanced faster numerical model.
Plus you all probably already saw that all AI models are of approximately the same quality despite for them were used factor of 10 different training times

Lutnick is really in love with himself. I have to put my hands up to my ears everytime he speaks. Same goes for Hegseth and Patel. The self promoting drivel is hard to take... And of course... we get outcomes like this...
