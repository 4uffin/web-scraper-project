President Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption for goods coming from China and Hong Kong in May 2025, with imports from the rest of the world following suit at the end of July 2025. This means that products entering the U.S. are now subject to customs duties and import taxes, even if their value is less than $800. This change most heavily affected online shoppers, especially those who are used to purchasing cheap goods from abroad. This has caused some retailers to take extreme 'countermeasures,' often to dissuade Americans from purchasing their products.Some sellers, particularly on eBay, have resorted to charging exorbitant shipping fees to deter Americans from purchasing their items. 404 Media reports seeing several listings of lightweight items from across the globe with high delivery costs.For example, there‚Äôs a camera lens from Japan priced at around $320, which only costs $29 to ship globally ‚Äî except for the U.S., which has a $2,000 delivery fee. Other sellers charge more than $500 to ship their items to the U.S., far more expensive than the actual price of the product. According to the report, this is much easier than taking down hundreds of listings and excluding the U.S. from them. There‚Äôs also the issue that some American buyers might not understand how tariffs work, and leave negative feedback on the seller, affecting their profile on the platform.

According to the Wall Street Journal, one customer bought a $77 shirt from a Swedish brand and was charged an extra $42.35 on top of the $30 shipping fee. Another person bought $640 worth of oven replacement parts from Canada and was surprised by a $1,196.12 ‚Äúgovernment charges‚Äù bill and a brokerage fee of $128.17. These tariffs and import taxes heavily affect tech goods, especially as many of them are manufactured outside of the U.S. Tom‚Äôs Hardware staff are also encountering a similar problem, though not to these extremes, even when dealing with review samples.This change has caused widespread confusion in international shipping, with many post offices across the globe suspending e-commerce shipments until they‚Äôve updated their systems to account for the new charges. The big shipping companies in the U.S. ‚Äî FedEx, DHL, and UPS ‚Äî reported that customers are confused by the new rules. And although they process tariff payments for imports, either by the buyer or the seller, the service is not free, resulting in additional brokerage or processing fees.Some sellers pay the tariffs upfront to make the transaction smoother for their customers, while others leave all these extra costs to the recipient. Nevertheless, the person who bought the item will ultimately be the one responsible for import taxes. But even though couriers are trying to make the process as smooth as possible, the payment process can sometimes be confusing.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

I was wondering before why Americans were able to buy a lot of things, let's say from Aliexpress, without complaining about import taxes. Now they can finally experience what it feels what others have to go through when buying imported goods.:D

This is just straight up shipping fraud, unless some shipping company is actually charging $2000. There's nothing new about it. Shady sellers have been doing this for years. Tariffs are just a new excuse.
If a seller doesn't want to ship to the US, Ebay lets them disable listings per-country. If they're listing with $2000 shipping instead, then they're hoping to get someone to actually pay it, not trying to dissuade buyers.

Americans already were and still are largely legally required to pay sales tax on imports. That's just a state level tax, and states haven't been very good about enforcing collection. The new federal taxes are added on top of that.

This is the cost that the seller incurs when shipping to the US. This cost is passed on to the customer. Or are you insisting that the seller to eat the tariff cost?

I bought a used Omega from Japan and had to pay over $500+ in tariff fees in order to get UPS to deliver it to me. I've bought more expensive watches in the past and only had to pay a tenth of that. Tariffs are being paid directly by the consumer.

That reads to me like "I don't want to deal with shipping to your country, but I will if you pay me this higher amount." In other words, it's a sort of penalty rate or "make it worth my time" fee. Ridiculous? Sure. Fraud? No, I don't think so.
My big concern with the tariffs and ending of exemptions is that these things are on-again, off-again, on-again without any sort of organized phase-in ramp-up.
