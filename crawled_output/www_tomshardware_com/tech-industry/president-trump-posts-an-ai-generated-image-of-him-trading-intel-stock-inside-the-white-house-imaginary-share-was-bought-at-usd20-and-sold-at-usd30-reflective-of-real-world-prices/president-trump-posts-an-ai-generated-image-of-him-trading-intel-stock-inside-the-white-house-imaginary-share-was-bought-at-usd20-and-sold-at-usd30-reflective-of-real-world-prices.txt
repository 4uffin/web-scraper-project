Taking to his Truth Social platform, President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself successfully trading Intel stock on a triple-monitor setup while sitting inside the White House with the sun glistening on him. It's essential to remember that the goal was not for the state to enrich its coffers through day trading, but rather to ensure that U.S. soil remains the place where the world's best chips are made.A few weeks ago, the U.S. Government purchased a 10% stake in Intel, an unprecedented move that is bound to shake up economic charts around the world. Intel has been struggling financially for a while, but it remains a homegrown American company and represents the United States' opportunity to lead the semiconductor industry. Intel was already receiving grants via the CHIPS Act to bolster local chipmaking, so the remaining handouts from that, combined with an equity investment in common stock, resulted in the White House now owning 10% of Intel. This investment appears to have been so lucrative that President Trump felt compelled to showcase it on social media.In the picture, the monitor on the far left shows shares bought at $20, which is actually accurate since the real-life purchase occurred at $20.47 per share. The monitor on the far right then shows a massive uptick, with the share apparently sold at $30. That's also somehow accurate, as Intel stock hit $30 a couple of days ago for the first time in over a year. Of course, the government didn’t sell its stake when that occurred, so perhaps it’s more of a personal achievement that President Trump is showcasing.

The mandatory disclaimer follows: this is not financial advice, but President Trump might influence investors and, more crucially, uninformed people around the country to buy Intel shares and HODL. Not to veer into whole tin-foil-hat territory, but any future investments that the White House makes could then become indicative of a seismic market shift, creating a bullish sentiment that pushes people to stock up (no pun intended) on equity in these firms. After all, what could be safer than following your own President’s lead?
President Trump with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, both heads now heavily invested into Intel (Image credit: Andrew Harnik /Getty Images)Intel’s liquidity and image have been on the rise since this investment, especially now that Nvidia has also purchased $5 billion worth of equity in the company and announced development on various collaborative projects. Chief among these is the Intel x86 RTX SoC, which will see the two chipmakers utilize each other’s CPU and GPU chiplets to create new high-performance processors.Ironically enough, Intel stock crept up to break the $30 barrier — posting its best day in 38 years — because of this announcement, not the U.S. Government’s. Even so, that $10 billion deal is already worth $13 billion as a result.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Did the author just use AI or did they actually research their article?
Buying stock in a floundering company was an 'unprecedented move', except it was not. The government did it in 2008 with about a dozen companies and was a majority share holder in Fannie Mae, GM, AIG and Ally Financial. .
" Intel stock hit $30 a couple of days ago for the first time in three years" <-- July 2024 intel stock was above $30 (for well over a year it was above $30). I'm pretty sure July 2024 was not 3 years ago How about 1yr ago?

A few weeks ago, the U.S. Government purchased a 10% stake in Intel, an unprecedented move that is bound to shake up economic charts around the world.
I don't understand why so many people and outlets are treating this like it's a big deal. The government gave Intel money, Intel gave a stake in return, it's how economics should work. Korea owns part of Samsung, Taiwan part of TSMC, several sovereign wealth funds own parts of many companies like Global Foundries, but the USA taking a stake in Intel is somehow "unprecedented"...
Especially when it's far from unprecedented for the USA, the government took stakes in banks and automotive companies during the meltdowns in exchange for funds to keep them afloat.
What sucks is all the people and institutions who bought Intel above $40 (myself included) before Gelsinger ran Intel into the ground with numerous bad decisions then took a golden parachute exit.

but at the same time.. if government invests in something.. they should always get something back in return.

Nothing to see here folks.idk about the last part. Former Presidents making (millions anyways) after leaving office, with questionable morality, sure. But I think this is the first president totally unconcerned with appearances while still in office. I think at least the others were concerned about appearances. And, I think this is our federal government totally collapsing. To say "nothing to see," sounds like a disillusioned Trump voter, but this Administration is something to be very, very concerned about. It's not like a third term(and that's his aim in spite of two term legal limit) is going to be more of the same. It's going to be something like a civil war, at least succession is a real possibility..

My last sentence is sarcasm. And cite a president that made billions while still in office like Donny. And I've had posts deleted because of my dislike of Donny.We're sorta on the same page but we're sorta talking past each other.

but rather to ensure that U.S. soil remains the place where the world's best chips are made.
that is factually a big lie easily proven.
