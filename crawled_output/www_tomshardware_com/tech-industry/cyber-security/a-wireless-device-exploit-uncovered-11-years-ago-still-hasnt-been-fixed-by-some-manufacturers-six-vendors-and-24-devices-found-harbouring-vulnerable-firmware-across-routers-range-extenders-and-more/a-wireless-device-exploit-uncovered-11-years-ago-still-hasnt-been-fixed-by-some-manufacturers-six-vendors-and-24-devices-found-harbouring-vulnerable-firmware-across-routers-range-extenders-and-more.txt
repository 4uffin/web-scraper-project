NetRise has revealed (PDF) that wireless devices from several manufacturers remain vulnerable to the Pixie Dust exploit disclosed in 2014, even though companies have had over a decade to harden their products against the well-known security flaw."Across six vendors, we found 24 devices, including routers, range extenders, access points, and hybrid Wi-Fi/powerline products, with firmware that was released vulnerable to Pixie Dust," NetRise said. "The oldest vulnerable firmware in the set dates to Sept. 2017, nearly three years after public disclosure of the Pixie Dust exploit. On average, vulnerable releases occurred 7.7 years after the exploit was first published."SecurityWeek reported that Pixie Dust can be "exploited to obtain a router’s [Wi-Fi Protected Setup] PIN and connect to the targeted wireless network without needing its password." All someone has to do to take advantage of this exploit is make sure they're within range of the network they want to access, capture the initial WPS handshake between the network and a client device, and then crack the PIN offline.

Pixie Dust is so well-known that numerous resources use it to demonstrate introductory wireless network hacking techniques. Researchers have also developed several open source tools capable of exploiting Pixie Dust—one of which is highlighted by the security-focused Kali Linux distribution—so manufacturers can't really feign ignorance about the ease with which vulnerable devices can be hacked.An exploit this old remaining viable on dated hardware wouldn't necessarily come as a surprise; most companies release enough products each year that it would be unreasonable to expect all of them to be fully supported in perpetuity. (Even if there are many people who don't want to upgrade to a newer gizmo.) But that doesn't seem to be what's happening with the devices NetRise scrutinized for its report."Of the 24 devices, only four were ever patched, and these patches arrived late," NetRise said. "As of this writing, thirteen devices remain actively supported but unpatched. Another seven reached end of life without ever receiving fixes. In some cases, vendors described fixes vaguely in changelogs as, 'Fixed some security vulnerability,' with no acknowledgement of Pixie Dust."This means six manufacturers released products with known vulnerabilities and, in many cases, have neglected to update the relevant firmware even though their customers have been assured the products are still being supported. Even the products that received patches did so long after the fact—NetRise said on average Pixie Dust patches arrived 9.6 years after the exploit's public disclosure.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over."The Pixie Dust exploit is not an isolated case but a symptom of systemic issues in firmware supply chains, from weak cryptography and poor entropy generation to opaque vendor patch practices," NetRise said.

Funny as it seems like disabling WPS was never removed as a Wi-Fi hardening control. Unfortunately, that's the 0.01 percenters that do that at home. That rate is much higher for enterprises.

Why are the manufacturers not being named and shamed for failing to update, or government regulatory action taken against them? Industry protecting themselves?

No offense, but would it be hard to name those 6 vendors and 24 devices? Nothing pisses me more than some clickbait that leads to nowhere.
By the way to save some time - they're not even mentioned in the original NetRise pdf...at least nothing except TP-Link in general. They're probably waiting for some idiot to pay for the results, like everyone always does.

das_stig said:Why are the manufacturers not being named and shamed for failing to update, or government regulatory action taken against them? Industry protecting themselves?Right!? This tells me that they are still under the responsible disclosure window. This approach makes sense (give a heads-up early on and then list specific vendors, models, etc. later) to allow end users time to patch, but in this case, there's little reason to believe that this vulnerability will get patched by vendors on older models at this point.
There's no real consequences for not releasing a software vulnerability patch for vendors operating in the U.S., at least not in regulatory terms. If a vuln was severe enough and could be proven to cause huge damages, it could be pursued in civil court, or maybe even criminal court if it resulted in a significant loss of life, e.g. medical machines in the healthcare industry. CISA mandates critical sectors and government to apply available patches or stop using the product or device, but that's a different matter.
