Sayem AhmedSocial Links NavigationSubscription EditorSayem's first foray into building PCs dates back to the 90s, where he helped his dad run a small PC business from their garage. After getting tired of installing Windows using a stack of floppy disks, he eventually became obsessed with disassembling video game consoles, without his parents' permission. His love for gaming led him to build his first gaming PC, using an Intel Core i5-2500K that spent most of its life overclocked, alongside a hand-me-down GeForce 9800 GTX. Since then, he's worked as a professional tech journalist since 2015, writing for Gamespot, IGN, and Dexerto. When Sayem isn't focused on the latest tech, he can usually be found playing his guitar, or reading old fantasy novels.
