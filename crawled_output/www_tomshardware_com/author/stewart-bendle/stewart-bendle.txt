Stewart BendleSocial Links NavigationDeals WriterStewart has loved PCs since he was a child dabbling with BASIC on a ZX Spectrum 48K and still gets far too excited about building and playing on PCs now. He loves to tune and overclock his computers to smooth and stable clocks and run his favorite games and applications on the best settings without compromising quality and framerates. A firm believer in “Bang for the buck,” Stewart likes to research the best prices and locate the best coupon codes for computers, components and peripherals. Stewart also needs a spare room to house all his old PC parts and peripherals and maybe needs an intervention to stop him from buying more headphones, mice, and keyboards.
