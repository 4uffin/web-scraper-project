If true, it's a big leap in performance.

The upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 was formally announced a few days ago, but now Geekbench leaks are rolling in. The keen-eyed X leaker Longhorn noticed an unnamed Xiaomi 25113PN0EC device (possibly a Xiaomi 17 Pro) with the Qualcomm SoC inside, posting a whopping 3,831-point single-threaded score, a value that should put it head-to-head with Apple's A19 Pro SoC inside the iPhone 17 Pro.If that figure is reflective of shipping products, that would be quite the leap for Qualcomm's chips. The company's SoCs have historically trailed Apple's designs by some margin in both performance and efficiency, so catching up would be quite the feat. The A19 Pro rings in at close to 3,900 points in Geekbench. To put this into perspective, even the mighty Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D post scores of about 3,400 and 3,500, respectively. That's by no means an ultimate measure of real-world performance, but it does display the might of contemporary Arm-based chips, at least in power-constrained scenarios.The 3,831-point figure for the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 might sound a little too good to be true — particularly as it would mean a generational uplift of over 34% — but it is at least consistent with leaks that showed a purported Samsung handset displaying a score of nearly 3,400 at only a 4 GHz boost clock speed. Per Qualcomm's recent announcement, the chip uses two performance cores and six efficiency cores, with the performance cores hitting 4.61 GHz in the standard configuration, or 4.74 GHz in a Samsung Galaxy-specific flavor. This makes 3,831 points at least plausible, as the recent score post shows 4.6 GHz for the performance cores. The new SoC is manufactured in TSMC's 3-nm N3P node, an evolution of the previous N3E.

Longhorn points out in their X post that "SVE2 and SME say hello", implying that the new chip ought to support the newer versions of Arm's Scalable Vector Instructions and Scalable Matrix Instructions. Both of these CPU instruction sets are called "SIMD" (Single Instruction Multiple Operation), making it easy for developers to efficiently process chunks of data at a time with few instructions.That means that applications that can make use of those instructions should see quite a significant speed boost. The original SVE was designed for AI-related data processing, but Arm says that SVE2 should cover more broad uses cases, and calls out general-purpose software, multimedia, computer vision, and in-memory databases. Geekbench does use SME (which in turn apparently needs a subset of SVE2), so the posted scores should reflect the use of these optimizations.By the way, if the "Gen 5" name in this report is throwing you off, know that you're not alone. Many people thought the new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC would be called "Gen 2", but Qualcomm has decided that the "Gen" suffix now applies to its series of Snapdragon products, making this chip the fifth generation, across Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, with the original Snapdragon 8 Elite counting as "Gen 4".Of course, consider that these recently-posted figures originate from leakers around the globe and may not reflect production silicon, clock-speed targets, or power envelopes of their final devices. Second, although Geekbench single-core results mostly track with general application performance, that may not be true of every scenario. Regardless, even if figures for production Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices are somewhat lower, that would still be an impressive showing.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.

Ok, nVidia and Intel are teaming up, so I guess it's time for AMD to team up with Qualcomm for ARM-based solutions in the AI Datacenter. ;)
Also, gj Qualcomm on taking the good fight to Apple.

I think no one will want make some pact with amd so soon... Only consoles because reasons.

Let's see what the efficiency is. I'll get the Qualcomm uses 20-30% more power to achieve that score, but multi-core will be a big test.

That much speedup is plausible if you include general generational speedup plus additional speed due to new instructions, like the article says, but the caveat is that if applications don't support SVE2 and SME then the performance boost will not be anywhere near as large, especially if these leaks were from the "for Samsung" edition.
Still, I'd rather have Apple like efficiency than more performance given how Samsung and Google aren't adopting silicon carbide batteries and using larger batteries the way One Plus and other Chinese manufacturers are, and the fact that the Snapdragon 8 line isn't exactly a performance slouch.

Qualcomm do this all the time.

Sure, but the A19 or a close derivant will be in the new $599 MacBook AIr where the thermals will be much better, and pro versions in the next MacBook Pros with fans and even better thermals, etc, etc

I'd love to know how long these tests take, because it makes a big difference whether we're talking about 2 second bursts vs. 2 minutes.
