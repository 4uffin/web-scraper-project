Ever since Apple started to develop its own smartphone processors, it has consistently offered the fastest system-on-chips for handsets, and more recently, these SoCs have even challenged CPUs for PCs when it comes to benchmark scores. The new six-core Apple A19 Pro does just that: it beats its predecessor, it leaves no chances for its arch-rival Snapdragon 8 Elite, and even conquers desktop-grade CPUs in the single-thread Geekbench 6 benchmark. In addition, the processor seems to pack the highest-performing smartphone GPU, offering performance comparable to that of GPUs for client PCs and tablets.11% - 12% higher CPU performanceSwipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 A19 ProA18 ProA17 ProA16 BionicSnapdragon 8 EliteSnapdragon 8 Gen 3 General specifications2P+4E, up to 4.26 GHz2P+4E, up to 4.0 GHz2P+4E, up to 3.77 GHz2P+4E, up to 3.46 GHz2P+6E, up to 4.47 GHz5P+3E, up to 3.01 GHz Single-Thread389535052950264128621959 Multi-Thread974686587279698994814989The latest A19 Pro smartphone CPU from Apple scores 3,895 points in single-thread Geekbench 6 tests, outpacing its predecessor by 11% and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite by 36%. In addition, the new chip leaves behind all stock processors for client devices, including Apple's own M4 (by 5.3%) and AMD's mighty Ryzen 9 9950X (by 11.8%). Given Apple's focus on performance efficiency, it is not surprising that the new SoC beats everything in single-thread workloads.The new A19 Pro application processor also scores 9,746 points in the multi-thread Geekbench 6 test, which is 12% higher compared to A18 Pro. However, the smartphone SoC still cannot beat CPUs for desktops and notebooks in multi-thread workloads, which is not surprising.

While an 11% - 12% generation-to-generation performance increase looks fairly solid, it is lower compared to the improvements of the A18 Pro compared to the A17 Pro (circa 18%).Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 A19 ProM4M3Ryzen 9 9950XCore i9-14900KS General specifications2P+4E, up to 4.26 GHz4P+6E, up to 4.40 GHz4P+4E, up to 4.05 GHz16P/32T, 4.30 GHz - 5.75 GHz8P+16E/32T, 3.20 GHz - 6.0 GHz Single-Thread38953697307634823362 Multi-Thread974613778118632358423445Apple's A19 Pro SoC features two high-performance cores operating at up to 4.26 GHz (+6.5%) and featuring improved branch prediction (higher performance in branch-heavy workloads and better power efficiency) and increased front-end bandwidth (which points to higher instructions-per-cycle, but does not indicate how many instructions the core can decode per cycle) as well as four energy-efficient cores that now boast with a 50% larger last level cache compared to the predecessor.The A19 Pro processor is made by TSMC on its N3P fabrication process, which is an optical shrink of N3E that enables a 4% higher transistor density as well as a 5% performance increase at the same power or a 5% - 10% power consumption reduction at the same frequency compared to N3E.Given the capabilities of the fabrication process, a 6.5% clock speed boost looks quite solid. The CPU also has some microarchitectural improvements, so its performance advantages over its predecessor go beyond the frequency improvement. However, given the fact that Apple uses a vapor chamber cooling system and an aluminum unibody chassis for its iPhone 19 Pro, it is surprising that the company did not increase CPU clocks more significantly to get higher peak performance. Perhaps the company decided to focus on workloads that are branch-heavy and/or benefit from higher IPC more than from sole frequency; it looks like these enhancements do not significantly improve performance in Geekbench 6.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.37% higher GPU performanceAt the presentation of its A19 Pro, Apple did not reveal anything about improvements to its GPU, but said that it still has six clusters. Based on Geekbench 6 results published so far, the A19 Pro GPU is a whopping 37% faster than its predecessor. The GPU scores 45,657 points, which is comparable to the GPU performance of M2 or M3 in iPad Air.

So as soon as Facebook app is installed you'll never see any single threaded performance benefit ever again? The number of apps running background tasks constantly on a phone is probably absurd. I really wonder how relevant single threaded performance is with much of anything anymore. But in all seriousness it's good to see competition lighting a fire under the competition. None of these things are ever fast enough for me.

Ugh, Geekbench, Geekbench, Geekbench.
In the same way you love saying to 'take results with a pinch of salt' in every other performance/specs leak article, I really think you should also be noting that 'Geekbench test results may not be representative of actual performance'.
Especially when it comes to Apple.

How is the A19 Pro beating the M4 in single thread?
Or, put another way, if the A19 Pro core design is so good, why didn't Apple use it in their M4?

Also, chips for mobiles are going to be tuned for efficiency, while laptops have better cooling and more power, and their chips can be tuned more for performance.
Also, of course, laptop chips are going to have completely different memory subsystem, connectivity options, etc.

Comparing a mobile SoC with a 16 core, 32 thread, 170 W TDP, desktop CPU, seems more than a little pointless, especially as we're only talking about single-threaded performance. Who buys any Ryzen 9, just for it's single-threaded performance?

In theory, there's no reason they couldn't make a 9600X with the same peak clock speed, but they bin the dies and save the best for their premium, flagship product, and then sandbag the rest of the lineup with lower boost limits.
Dementoss said:especially as we're only talking about single-threaded performance. Who buys any Ryzen 9, just for it's single-threaded performance?It's just a way to compare the CPU cores, themselves. Once you know that, you can plug those numbers into a scaling model and predict how something like an Apple M5 Max would perform on multi-threaded workloads.
Also, just because someone buys a CPU with lots of cores doesn't mean they don't care about single-thread performance. It's still the "long pole" in a lot of computing tasks we do quite routinely.

Comparing mobile SoC's to desktop chips is really academic more than anything. The truth of it is that the 9950X doesn't need any defending, but if one were to do so, I would immediately surface that the 9950X is on an architecture that is over a year old and less advanced TSMC node. It was previously compared to the A18 chips which makes for something closer to an apples-to-apples comparison.
Again, this is not a flat comparison at all, so no need for anyone to get heated. Apple is a much larger and more profitable company than AMD... if anything, it should be surprising that AMD does this well in single-thread perf.

Let that sink in, for a minute.
Yeah, I totally get the node disparity, but consumers buy products, not nodes. I don't know when Macs with these cores will hit the market, but Zen 6 should be getting pretty close by then. Not sure if Zen 6 will entirely erase that gap, especially when these Apple cores will be running on better power & cooling than seen here, but Zen 6 will definitely strengthen AMD's position.
However, I think the dirty secret of Zen 5 is really that AMD focused more on multi-threaded performance than single-thread. They kept the 4-wide decoder and just added another one that only kicks in when another thread is sharing the core. They doubled down on SMT, at the same time as Intel disabled it.

I'm not actually surprised by this. One of the biggest complaints people have had about the iPhone 15 and 16 lines was that the device gets too hot. My guess is Apple ramped the clocks just enough to not get into the too hot category again.
