Despite being an AM4 CPU, stores have warned that the chip is not compatible with B550 and A520 chipset AM4 motherboards.

It has become common practice for AMD and Intel to re-release processors from several generations-old architectures. Japanese news outlet Akiba reports that AMD has relaunched its entry-level dual-core Athlon 3000G with new packaging and a cooler, featuring part number YD3000C6FHSBX. The chip is on sale for ¥5,790, which translates to approximately $40.The Athlon 3000G is one of the slowest CPUs you can install in an AM4 motherboard. The CPU was released in 2019 as AMD's entry-level processor, succeeding the Athlon 200GE series that preceded it. The chip has two unlocked Zen CPU cores, four threads, just 4MB of L3 cache, a 35W TDP, and a 3.5 GHz clock speed. For graphics, the 3000G comes with a Vega 3-based iGPU featuring three CUs, 192 cores, and a 1.1GHz clock speed.AMD launched a second variant of the chip in 2023, featuring a beefier Wraith cooler, new packaging, and a newer die based on the Dali architecture. Dali was an offshoot of Raven Ridge that was cheaper to manufacture, but based on the same 14nm process. As a result, performance is identical between the original and refreshed versions. One interesting tidbit about the Dali die is that it only features two physical cores; by contrast, the original Raven Ridge version of the 3000G had a quad-core die with two disabled cores.

The latest re-release is unsurprisingly based on the newer Dali version of the Athlon 3000G. The aforementioned part number (YD3000C6FHSBX) confirms this. Models with the letters "FH" included signify that they are the newer models; by contrast, part numbers including "FB" represent the original models.It may seem silly for AMD to release an entry-level CPU that is now six years old, running on an architecture introduced eight years ago. But AMD would not release a CPU like this unless it knew there was still a market for it. The Ryzen 5 5500X3D is an excellent example of this being an "all-new" Ryzen CPU based on the Zen 3 architecture, but it is region-locked to Latin America. The Ryzen 5 5600F and Ryzen 5 7400 are similar, both being locked to the Asian market.Intel is also no stranger to this strategy; it recently released the Core i5-110, based on its Comet Lake 14nm architecture, an architecture that debuted five years ago in chips such as the Core i9-10900K.The only caveat owners will need to be aware of is motherboard compatibility for the 3000G. The chip is so old that AMD's latest iteration of 500-series AM5 motherboards doesn't support it. Technically, these boards can help, but AMD has released so many AM4 CPUs over the past eight years that there likely isn't enough room in the firmware memory of 500-series motherboards to accommodate such old chips.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The chip is so old that AMD's latest iteration of 500-series AM5 motherboards doesn't support it. Technically, these boards can help, but AMD has released so many AM4 CPUs over the past eight years that there likely isn't enough room in the firmware memory of 500-series motherboards to accommodate such old chips.I don't like that. Lose some eye candy or start adding 64 MiB ROM as default or whatever.

Hopefully AMD releases another chip for AM4.
It would be a shame if support ended like this.
Dial core not compatible with newer AM4 boards.

I think the biggest market for something like this would be a home media server, but a dual core is of questionable power for those in 2025, especially when companies like Synology are using quad core Celerons in their entry level media server class systems like the DS225+.

Dial core not compatible with newer AM4 boards.The cheapest die AMD has used for AM5 so far is Phoenix2. The 8300G has 1+3 cores disabled from 2+4, and full 740M graphics (4 CUs).
I don't know if Mendocino can be used. It supports LPDDR5 but not DDR5 AFAIK.
The biggest cut we've seen is the Ryzen AI 5 330. That's Krackan Point with 4+4 cores and 8 CUs disabled down to 1+3 and 2 CUs, which is nuts. That could go on AM5 if AMD wants.
Just get a 5500 or something.

Perhaps some use in a mini ITX arcade MAME cabinet? Been looking for something dirt ass cheap for a pedestal. My measure is running Blitz full speed...

Me and my brother put peanut butter into our NES... I can only imagine what other ideas other kids might have. Sure, I would prefer buying used, but some people like the sense of comfort that comes with a warranty.
