New entry-level champ?

The Core Ultra 3 205 represents the lower end of Intel’s current generation of Arrow Lake desktop processors. While the CPU is not officially available for purchase yet, an early review by Korean reviewer Bulls Lab gives us an idea about its capabilities. The entry-level CPU features a hybrid architecture with four P-cores that can boost up to 4.9 GHz and four E-cores capable of going up to 4.4 GHz, giving the chip competitive clock speeds for an entry-level processor.The reviewer tested the Core Ultra 3 205 by pairing it with a budget H810 motherboard along with 32GB of DDR5 memory. By the looks of it, the processor is capable of delivering good performance for everyday computing and can handle multiple browser tabs, as well as 8K YouTube videos at low CPU usage. In terms of power draw, the chip can draw up to 65W, and it is recommended to use a third-party CPU cooler instead of the stock Intel heatsink for better thermal performance.

The reviewer also ran synthetic benchmark tests to quantify the performance of the CPU, where it scored 13,394 points in Cinebench R23’s multi-core test, a 48% jump over the Core i3-14100. In terms of single-core performance, the Core Ultra 3 205 achieved 1,983 points, outperforming both the Core i3-14100 and the Core i5-14400.

Furthermore, the iGPU solution on the Core Ultra 3 205 is significantly superior to what’s offered on previous-gen Raptor Lake Refresh chips. As a result, it not only surpasses the Core i3-14100 and Core i5-14400 in 3DMark Time Spy, but also delivers performance comparable to the Core Ultra 5 225, since both feature the same 2 Xe-cores. While the integrated GPU is not powerful enough to run demanding game titles, it can handle less resource-intensive games such as DOTA and Valorant.Considering the performance, the Core Ultra 3 205 is shaping up to be a solid entry-level option, especially for budget gaming builds. As always, pricing is going to play a big role in its appeal, with Bulls Lab suggesting the CPU is listed at 199,000 Won (approx $140), which is in line with previous reports that suggested a $150 price tag. The reviewer also points to a pre-built PC with the Core Ultra 3 205, 8GB RAM, and a 500GB SSD listed at 499,000 Won, which is roughly around $360. Intel is yet to officially list the processor on its retail channels, and early sightings have mostly been limited to overseas markets like South Korea. Based on earlier reports, the chip may end up primarily in pre-built systems or with OEM and system-integrators rather than being offered as a standalone boxed CPU. This would make it difficult for DIY PC builders to get their hands on one.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Budget friendly options are probably the best move, for Intel right now, as they really cannot compete on the high end this gen.

It will end up in epic clearance PCs. Though the iGPU has less legs than the 3-4 Xe cores in 235/245.

this is a budget 4+4 core CPU and has ~13.000
,that's 1/3 of the 9950x ...
Also this is using tsmc so if they wanted to they could make an 16+16 monster or whatever they wanted, you can't say that it would be an intel node and would burn up or need a nuclear reactor or that they don't have the yields.

if price can be maintained like I3-14100 then it is a very good choice for budget user. finally i3 users can say good bye to 4 cores CPU

They aren't competing on the high end right now, except in some niche scenarios. Most DIY is targeted towards gamers, and Intel is losing to AMD big time in this area.
In the top 10 CPU sales, on Amazon, there is a single Intel chip, the 12700k, at #9.
I have multiple times recommended 12700k's for budget builders, because the price has been so good. Especially so with those that a decent DDR4 kit to carry over from an existing Intel rig.
Offering more budget friendly options is a good idea. That was one of the big appeals of Ryzen early on. They offered decent performance at a better price. Beating a 14th gen i5, and avoiding the issues of Raptor lake is a win they could use right now. The socket longevity is a bit of an issue, for future upgrades. For a set it and forget it budget gaming rig, these should be just fine.

I 100% agree that they do not compete for the high end, DIY, gaming market, I 100% disagree on they cannot.

"Other" would be all the smaller PC builders and retail CPUs ,and intel still outsells AMD 2:1 in volume, but you can also tell that a lot of expensive AMD cpus are being sold by how much revenue AMD does from that volume.

It was a better price compared to workstation and HEDT CPUs but people wanted desktop CPUs.

There is money to be made in the higher end segments, they're not just willingly holding back here. Saying "oh they could compete" means nothing when its purely hypothetical and there's no evidence of it.
Chips do not scale quite like this. All core clocks come down when you add cores, yields drop, heat becomes unmanageable. There's a lot more to it than just the node being decent, the arch underneath has to be able to handle it. Considering the chips don't exist, it clearly can't feasibly.
TerryLaze said:"Other" would be all the smaller PC builders and retail CPUs ,and intel still outsells AMD 2:1 in volume, but you can also tell that a lot of expensive AMD cpus are being sold by how much revenue AMD does from that volume.Its easy for Intel to bribe OEMs to buy their chips and not AMDs. They've done it before, proved in court, there's a lot of evidence they have continued to do it more recently. But on the retail market where that doesn't work it actually shows who sells better naturally.
