Clock speed specifications reveal differences between these processors, with the 9950X3D operating at a 4.3GHz base clock with boost capabilities reaching 5.7GHz, representing the highest boost clock in the X3D lineup. The 9800X3D, conversely, features a 4.7GHz base clock with boost frequencies of 5.2GHz.The second-gen 3D V-Cache tech represents a revolutionary architectural advancement that marks a big improvement over their predecessors. Unlike previous X3D generations, where the 3D V-Cache was positioned above the CCD, both processors feature the cache positioned below the CCD, enabling direct thermal contact between the cores and the integrated heat spreader.This design transformation dramatically improves thermal characteristics, allowing both processors to achieve full overclocking capabilities (a first for X3D processors) while maintaining higher boost frequencies than their predecessors. The thermal improvements are particularly significant for the 9950X3D, which maintains its 170W TDP despite its larger cache capacity.Platform support and connectivity specifications show AMD's commitment to the AM5 ecosystem. Both CPUs drop into the AM5 socket (LGA 1718) and are compatible with the full range of AM5 chipsets, including A620, B650, B650E, X670, X670E, X870, X870E, B840, and B850. Memory support extends to DDR5 with official specifications up to 5600 MT/s, though both processors can achieve higher speeds through AMD EXPO memory overclocking technology.The processors provide 24 usable PCIe 5.0 lanes from the CPU, four native USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and comprehensive storage support including NVMe RAID configurations. Power consumption differs significantly, with the 9950X3D coming with a 170W TDP compared to the 9800X3D's 120W TDP, reflecting the increased thermal and power demands of the dual-CCD configuration.⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3DThe Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D share a common Zen 5 foundation but diverge in their feature sets to serve distinct purposes. On paper alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is more impressive due to its higher clocks and additional cores, thus taking this round.Gaming Benchmarks and Performance: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DWhile our in-depth Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reviews offer a more comprehensive analysis and our test system specs, in this section, we will focus on a gaming performance overview. The following benchmark graphs display average FPS and 1% lows for various games at 1080p. Using a high-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card ensures GPU limitations are removed, making this setup ideal for comparing pure CPU performance.Image 1 of 20(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)In our 16-game geometric mean at 1080p with High/Ultra settings, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D narrowly edges out the Ryzen 9 9950X3D with an average of 195.5 FPS versus 194.8 FPS, which is a negligible 0.4% difference. This parity stems from AMD’s 3D V-Cache technology, which minimizes latency in cache-sensitive titles.However, the 9950X3D’s higher core count rarely translates to gaming gains, as most games prioritize cache and clock speeds over core quantity. For example, in A Plague Tale: Requiem, the 9800X3D leads by 5.9% on average, likely due to its optimized single-CCD design reducing inter-core latency.On the flip side, the 9950X3D pulls ahead in 1% lows according to our testing, scoring 136 FPS in the geomean compared to the 9800X3D’s 134 FPS, gaining a minor 1.4% advantage. This reflects its superior multi-core capabilities, mitigating stutter during asset streaming or background tasks.Moving on to individual results, the picture becomes even more nuanced and needs analysis on a case-by-case basis. In our testing, we typically see that cache-bound games favor the 9800X3D. Minecraft RT shows a 10.9% average FPS lead. In Starfield, the Ryzen 7 leads by 1.7% in average FPS.On the contrary, heavily multi-threaded titles seem to lean toward the 9950X3D. In Baldur’s Gate 3, the Ryzen 9 leads by about 2.6%, exploiting its dual-CCD design to gain an advantage in this title.The 9800X3D dominates efficiency, achieving 2.46 FPS/W versus the 9950X3D’s 1.61 FPS/W, which is a tremendous 52.8% improvement. It consumes just 79.4W under load according to our testing, while the 9950X3D draws 52% more power at 120.9W. This gap arises from the 9800X3D’s monolithic 8-core design, which avoids the power overhead of the 9950X3D’s dual-CCD configuration.The 9800X3D also offers superior value for money, gaining a staggering 50% advantage in our FPS per dollar chart. Priced 33% lower, the Ryzen 7 achieves almost the same average FPS in our Geomean as the 9950X3D. Even in titles where the 9950X3D wins, like Far Cry 6, the 9800X3D’s cost efficiency remains unmatched. The 9950X3D does not justify its price premium in the gaming category when compared to its younger sibling.⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DUnless you are pairing gaming with heavy streaming or rendering, the 9800X3D’s cache-optimized design and aggressive pricing make it AMD’s gaming champion.Ultimately, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D emerges as the smarter gaming investment. It matches the 9950X3D in average framerates while excelling in efficiency and value. The 9950X3D’s edge in 1% lows is nice, but it cannot be justified by its hefty price premium.Productivity Performance: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DAccording to our benchmark results, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D demonstrates a substantial productivity advantage over the Ryzen 7 9800X3D across both single-threaded and multi-threaded workloads.Image 1 of 6(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)In the aggregated single-threaded geomean, the 9950X3D scores 258, while the 9800X3D trails at 243, leaving a 5.8% performance gap. For multi-threaded geomean, the disparity widens dramatically: the 9950X3D achieves 635 versus the 9800X3D’s 367, translating to a 42% delta. This underscores the 9950X3D’s superior power budget and higher core count.Image 1 of 10(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)The 9950X3D’s 16-core design obliterates the 9800X3D’s 8-core setup in heavily parallelized tasks. Cinebench 2024 multi-core reveals a massive 43% performance delta; meanwhile, the POV-Ray multi-core test exacerbates this further as the 9950X3D scores a whopping 69% higher than the 9800X3D.Real-world encoding tests like HandBrake x265 further validate this trend, with the 9950X3D achieving a 63% leap over the 9800X3D. This makes the 9950X3D a powerhouse for video rendering, 3D compilation, or scientific simulations where core scalability is paramount.In tasks reliant on single-core speed, the 9950X3D also maintains a consistent lead, even though the gap narrows significantly. Cinebench 2024 single-core shows a 4.7% advantage, and the gap expands in POV-Ray single-core, where the 9950X3D has a 7.6% higher score than its younger sibling.Even in lighter workloads like WebXPRT4 (browser-based tasks), the 9950X3D maintains a modest but notable 4.4% edge. The narrower gap confirms that browser-based tasks are less core-dependent, favoring cache/clock speed, yet the 9950X3D still leads. These modest gains reflect the close architectural similarities between the two CPUs in tasks that don’t necessarily scale with core count.The 9950X3D’s dual-CCD layout (one with 3D V-Cache, one with higher clocks) optimizes it for hybrid productivity: cache-sensitive tasks leverage the stacked die, while all-core workloads engage both CCDs. The 9800X3D’s single-CCD design restricts it in lighter multi-threaded tasks despite its cache advantage.Putting it all together, for productivity alone, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is decisively superior, delivering 10-40% higher performance on average, with peaks exceeding 60% in core-heavy tasks. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains viable for budget-focused users handling lighter workloads, but professionals demanding uncompromised rendering, encoding, or compilation speed should opt for the 9950X3D.⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3DIts massive compute throughput advantage, driven by its doubled core count, makes the 9950X3D the unequivocal choice for professional productivity, while the 9800X3D serves well for mainstream users where its strong gaming performance and lower cost are prioritized over extreme multi-threaded muscle.Overclocking: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DBoth the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D represent a significant advancement in X3D processor overclocking capabilities compared to their predecessors. Unlike previous X3D generations that had severe overclocking limitations, both Zen 5-based processors support full manual overclocking, including multiplier adjustments, voltage modifications, and extensive tuning options.This is a revolutionary change from the Zen 4 X3D processors that were largely locked down, with the 7800X3D only supporting limited PBO and Curve Optimizer adjustments. The key architectural improvement enabling this overclocking freedom is AMD's redesigned 3D V-Cache placement.In Zen 5 X3D processors, the 3D V-Cache is positioned underneath the Core Complex Dies (CCDs) rather than on top, dramatically improving thermal management and reducing the voltage sensitivity that previously restricted overclocking. This design change allows both processors to maintain higher boost frequencies while supporting the same overclocking toolkit as the regular Zen 5 processors.The processors responds well to both traditional overclocking methods and AMD's advanced tuning tools, including Precision Boost Overdrive 2 (PBO2), Curve Optimizer, and the new Curve Shaper feature exclusive to Zen 5 processors. AMD has plenty of manual tuning option available, but most users are best just engaging the automated Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) feature.⭐Winner: TieBoth chips leverage the same AMD overclocking suite, so this section works out to a tie.Power Consumption, Efficiency, and Cooling: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DImage 1 of 10(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)According to our test results, the power profiles of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D reveal significant differences under load while showing remarkable similarity at idle, directly impacting efficiency and cooling requirements.Image 1 of 7(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)Under sustained AVX workloads, the 9950X3D consumes substantially more power than the 9800X3D, reflecting its higher core count and performance ceiling. In the grueling Prime95 Small FFTs test, the 9950X3D averages 215W compared to the 9800X3D's 171W, which is a substantial 25.7% increase. This pattern repeats in y-cruncher's AVX test, where the 9950X3D draws 23.9% more power than the 9800X3D.Even in Cinebench 2024 multi-core rendering, which favors thread scaling, the 9950X3D requires 57.8% more power than its younger brother. This consistently higher power draw under heavy vectorized or multi-threaded loads is inherent to the 9950X3D's doubled core resources.Remarkably, both CPUs demonstrate nearly identical power efficiency during low-activity states. In active idle states (such as YouTube playback), the 9950X3D uses 31% more power than the 9800X3D, but the actual difference is 9W. However, in true idle scenarios, the gap narrows to just 3W, which is pretty negligible in the big picture. This parity highlights that the 9950X3D efficiently powers down unused cores, but also highlights that both chips carry the same power burden of the central I/O die, which ultimately results in higher idle power consumption for Zen 5 processors compared to Intel offerings.Despite its higher power consumption, the 9950X3D often delivers superior performance-per-watt in multi-threaded tasks. In our Cinebench 2024 "Watts per Point" metric, the 9950X3D scores a 10.8% efficiency advantage over the 9800X3D. Similarly, in HandBrake x265 encoding, the 9950X3D achieves a 6.4% lead in efficiency despite consuming more raw power in the test itself.This indicates the 9950X3D's additional cores translate workloads into completed tasks more efficiently under heavy utilization. The "Estimated Task Energy" graph further confirms this trend, placing the 9950X3D in a significantly better (lower-right) position than Intel competitors and delivering way more FPS than the 9800X3D despite consuming almost similar task energy.The 9950X3D's higher sustained power load necessitates more robust cooling. A 360mm AIO liquid cooler is optimal for the 9950X3D to maintain optimal boost clocks during extended AVX workloads. The 9800X3D, with its peak draw nearly 20-25% lower, is far more forgiving. A capable dual-tower air cooler or 240mm AIO should suffice in most cases.At the end of the day, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the clear winner if you just compare the two CPUs by their peak power consumption, especially under heavy AVX loads, making it ideal for users prioritizing low heat output, quieter cooling, or constrained thermal environments.However, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D consumes 25-58% more power under load but delivers 6-11% better performance efficiency (work completed per watt) in multi-threaded scenarios like rendering and encoding. For users needing maximum multi-core throughput, the 9950X3D's efficiency may justify its higher power ceiling, though it demands stronger cooling to realize its full potential.⭐Winner: TieIf you want the absolute lowest power draw, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the obvious pick among these two CPUs. It is also easier to cool and is generally quite tame compared to the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, which consumes significantly more power under load.In contrast, the 9950X3D takes a significant win in power efficiency (performance-per-watt), highlighting that it delivers exceptional power characteristics of its own.Overall both chips have their charms, depending on the target workload. That leaves us with yet another tie -- the winner just depends on your personal use-case.Pricing: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DWhen comparing the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, the starting point is their respective CPU prices: the Ryzen 9 9950X3D costs $670 at the time of writing, while the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is priced at $470, a difference of $200. However, to truly assess which CPU offers better value for the money, it’s essential to consider the entire platform cost, including the motherboard, RAM, and CPU cooler.When examining the complete platform cost, both processors share identical requirements for supporting components, but they do have different needs in some areas. DDR5 memory pricing remains consistent across both builds, with 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory costing around $120-$150.The AM5 socket requirement means both CPUs could use the same types of motherboards, ranging from budget B650 boards at $125-$160 to premium X870 motherboards that can cost $320-$500. However, the 9950X3D's higher power consumption and thermal output requires a better motherboard than the 9800X3D.With a higher TDP and peak power consumption, the 16-core 9950X3D necessitates more robust VRM designs on motherboards for full performance, potentially adding $50-$100 to the platform cost.Cooling the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which has a lower TDP (120W) compared to its higher-end sibling (170W), can be adequately handled by a mid-tier solution. Options include a $50 to $70 air cooler or a $100 to $150 240mm AIO liquid cooler. In contrast, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D would benefit from a more capable solution, with a 360mm AIO liquid cooler being optimal, which can cost you about $150-200.Conclusively, the 9800X3D emerges as the superior choice for value-conscious builders, despite both processors delivering nearly identical gaming performance, as we already saw. The nearly $230 price difference represents money that could be allocated toward a better graphics card, faster storage, or premium peripherals, which are components that would provide more tangible benefits for gaming performance.As for the 9950X3D, its additional productivity capabilities justify its premium only for users who can leverage its extra cores for content creation, streaming, or professional workloads.⭐Winner: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DFor the vast majority of enthusiasts prioritizing gaming and overall bang-for-buck, the 9800X3D's combination of potent gaming performance and lower total platform cost makes it the clear winner for value. The 9950X3D is best reserved for users who explicitly need its extra cores and are willing to invest in the supporting high-end platform.Bottom Line: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D vs AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DSwipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3DAMD Ryzen 7 9800X3DFeatures and Specifications❌Row 1 - Cell 2 GamingRow 2 - Cell 1 ❌Productivity Applications❌Row 3 - Cell 2 Overclocking❌❌Power Consumption, Efficiency and Cooling❌❌PricingRow 6 - Cell 1 ❌Total44The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 7 9800X3D both bring impressive strengths to the table, ultimately leaving us with a 4-4 tie, but the winner for you will be clear based on your target workloads and budget.The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the clear champion for most users, particularly those prioritizing gaming performance and value.

What would happen if you turned off the non 3D cache CCD in the 9950X3D with respect to gaming and other metrics. The 9950X3D has a higher clock, and if the second CCD is no longer there confusing things, does it pick up a benefit from that higher clock?

So, how exactly are the X3D variants "superior"? Their advantage over the non-vcache variants are extremely small (sometimes close to run-to-run variance / rounding error), and given the increased cost... ugh.
I've generally preferred AMD CPUs for a couple of generations, and there's some really niche computing scenarios where the vcache chips shine – but I wish reviewers and tech influencers would scale back on the superlatives given how little real-world gain the hefty extra pricetag brings.

AMD all the way or GTFO. I chose the 9800X3D over the 9950X3D because it's still the best for gaming. I refused to consider Intel for gaming.

Various titles/applications will barely benefit, or have a actual large benefit. It all just depends on how much the program uses the cache.
most stuff won't really use it well but when it does the improvement is substantial.
Do most people really need the extra cache? no, but it is an option if you know oyu'll benefit from it.
quite a number of older games benefit more than newer games.
WoW, MS flight sim, factorio (and other games that are mostly entirely cpu & ram focused)for example is a game that LOVES the cache to point you can get a 50-60%+ fps bump vs a non x3d chip.
basically you would want to look if a game/application you care about uses it much to make it worth the extra cost. (again msot wont)

It's not a tie, it comes down to what you want out of it.
Gaming, lower power consumption and lower thermals, 9800X3D. Pay less.
Want to game and use it for productivity? 9950X3D. Pay more. Get more.

Did you read the article? The 9950X3D is 30% more performant in average in games as compared to the 9950X. This not "extremely small".
The X3Ds are gaming chips by the way. So if you are talking about productivity tasks then you should know that those CPUs are not advertised for that and if you are not gaming, then yeah, don't waste your money on a X3D. Otherwise, they are vastly superior to their non-X3D counterparts.
Zen 5 has been a very disappointing generation, people even talking about a flop because of the very little improvement over Zen 4, except for the 9800X3D, 9900X3D and 9950X3D that are praised for being by far the best gaming chips ever made. So I don't know where your "very small advantage" is coming from, but either you are terribly wrong or there's some big conspiracy involving AMD, computer websites and pretty much every tech youtuber that managed to fool us all.

Not all of us are gamers OR productivity users.
Some of us actually do both... And if you do both, it's a no brainer to go with the 9950X3D over the lower core-count 9800X3D.

You can literally have your cake and eat it too. The 9800X3D trounces the 7800X3D for productivity, but is not appreciably faster for gaming. Also there are many productivity apps that like cache, eg OpenFOAM and other fluid sim software. Just look at the massive difference v-cache makes to EPYC performance.
I don't even see the point of the 9950X and 9900X now the X3D variants are no worse in productivity.

I don't even see the point of the 9950X and 9900X now the X3D variants are no worse in productivity.I was replying to the guy who was claiming that there was very little advantage for the X3D over the regular chips (which is obviously false). But the X3Ds are coming with a higher price tag as compared to the non-X3D counterparts, so if you are not gaming and don't use anything that benefits from the extra cache then you pay the extra money for nothing. The highest benefit of a X3D is gaming. But I agree that if you need both productivity and gaming the Zen 5 X3Ds are a no brainer since they no longer have the thermal limitation of the two previous gens. I know, I bought a 9800X3D two weeks after its launch.
