A new report claims that Intel is set to increase the price of its older Raptor Lake chips by as much as 10% in the face of the continued popularity of the lineup and customers shunning AI-equipped Lunar Lake models, according to Digitimes. While the report doesn't specify which models are set for an increase, it specifically highlights that chips launched in October 2022 (13th-gen chips), noting that prices will increase from $150-160 to $170-$180. This could encompass some popular i3 or i5 models, depending on the region and availability.This increase will occur despite the company announcing that the integrated GPU drivers for these processors will be placed on legacy software support, effectively putting them on the back burner, despite some having launched as recently as 2023. Digitimes cites industry insiders who say "lukewarm" consumer response to AI PCs as a factor.Intel's current crop of processors hasn't performed well in the market, with CEO Lip-Bu Tan commenting frankly that the chips aren't competitive in the market. That, coupled with customers seeking value options, has led many to opt for lower-cost previous-generation models instead.

The Raptor-Lake price jump aligns with the soaring costs of DDR4 memory chips, meaning PC makers will be hard-pressed to keep their prices low by opting to use the older memory in lieu of newer, faster DDR5, thereby squeezing the budget end of the PC building market. According to the report, some brands are even experiencing supply shortages, especially as the volatility of chip pricing is making them reluctant to place long-term orders. Due to this, PC and component prices may increase slightly as we approach the end of 2025.Windows 10’s end-of-life this coming October might result in some corporate sales, especially for companies unwilling to pay for extended support. However, this is less of a concern for consumers, meaning it’s unlikely that retail sales will increase as a result. The upcoming holiday season may drive some sales figures, especially if companies release great deals.We've pinged Intel for comment and will update as neccesary.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Not sure what "outdated" means. Despite the bios issues but likely because of them, these will go down as some of the best value for performance CPUs ever.

Intel is yet again shooting itself in the foot. Increasing prices will result in people switching to AMD, which many have already been doing for a while. Looks like Intel is eager to accelerate this process.

Why would people want those heaters without avx512 support?

I run a 13900, undervolted it runs exceptionally well and full 24 cores/ 32 threads, Not sure why I would upgrade although the dirt cheap 265k has been tempting me, but then I need to find a mobo and 32/64gb of ddr5. I sure hope refresh is more compelling or it looks like I am waiting till Nova lake, and what is nova lake coming like 6 months after arrow refresh?

The main thing for me is the fact that they're not continuing this socket, granted I should have done a little more research ig but I got a z890 with a 285K and then come to find out that they're trashing 1851 after one refresh. Very disappointing

Might as well wait to see how Nova Lake pans out.
Really no way of knowing for sure when Nova Lake will arrive; even when the launch date is set, only time will tell if that ends up being more of a paper launch or proper launch. Still, some testers will get their hands on one and be able to reveal absolute and relative performance.

Very disappointingIntel generally hasn't been great about keeping sockets going for several CPU generations, so why is this a surprise (lack of research as you mentioned / new to PC building)? A big change like backside power delivery is surely going to warrant a new socket, yeah?

Looks like Intel is eager to accelerate this process.People that willingly seek out raptor lake, after years of bad news about them, are not going to switch over to AMD...people that buy arrow lake would be the people that would switch over to AMD because those are looking for efficiency or whatever, people that want raptor want the clock (or maybe ram) speeds that TSMC just can't provide.

The cheap ddr4 motherboard options aren't quite there like they used to be, unless you are willing to buy a board that will kill itself with poor VRM design.

This is solely about OEMs and them wanting RPL chips still because Intel is (was?) selling them for less money. When Intel 7 is running at capacity due to this it stands to reason Intel should do something to benefit from it.
