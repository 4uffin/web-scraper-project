Qualcomm is back for round two of its push into Windows PCs. At its Snapdragon Summit in Maui, Hawaii, the company revealed its Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Extreme. These chips will serve as the high-end offerings in Qualcomm's second generation of Arm-based chips for laptops and other PC form factors.The Elite Extreme is a new tier above the standard Elite, which was the top chip in the original X-series line. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme will offer up to 18 cores, and Qualcomm claims it's the first Arm chip to hit 5 GHz (on up to two cores).The company says its Elite chips will be made on a 3-nanometer process node. The Snapdragon X2 Elite uses a mix of Qualcomm Oryon Prime cores and what it calls Performance CPU cores. This is seemingly a standard Performance/Efficiency layout with different names. At normalized power, Qualcomm says it offers up to 75% more performance than its competitors. In multitasking, it claims the new chips will offer up to 31% faster performance at a normalized ISO power, while needing 43% less power than last-gen chips. We don't yet have benchmarks to share, and Qualcomm didn't note the exact TDPs for these chips.

(Image credit: Qualcomm)The Elite Extreme has higher clock speeds in both single- and dual-core boost and multi-core max than the other two Snapdragon X2 Elite variants. The Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme is model X2E-96-100, while the standard Elites are X2E-88-100 and X2E-80-100. The Extreme and the 88-100 each have 18 cores, while the 80-100 has 12 cores.There's also a new Qualcomm Adreno GPU, which the company says brings a 2.3x increase in performance per watt and power efficiency compared to the last generation. The new 80 TOPS NPU looks to be the fastest in a laptop (with INT8 math), with 78% more TOPS than the previous generation, 45 TOPS NPU. In its press release, Qualcomm writes that this NPU "is designed to handle Copilot+ and concurrent AI experiences." (Copilot+ doesn't include actual Copilot, the assistant that runs largely in the cloud.)Swipe to scroll horizontallyHeader Cell - Column 0 Snapdragon X2 Elite ExtremeSnapdragon X2 EliteSnapdragon X2 ElitePart numberX2E-96-100X2E-88-100X2E-80-100Cores (Prime / Performance)12 / 612 / 66 / 6Boost frequency (Single-core / dual-core)5.0 GHz / 5.0 GHz4.7 GHz / 4.7 GHz4.7 GHz / 4.4 GHzMulti-core max frequency3.6 GHz3.4 GHz3.4 GHzTotal cache53 MB53 MB34 MBQualcomm Adreno GPU partX2-90X2-90X2-85Max frequency (GPU)1.85 GHz1.70 GHz1.70 GHzNPU TOPS (INT8)808080Memory TypeLPDDR5X-9523LPDDR5X-9523LPDDR5X-9523Max memory capacity128+ GB128 GB128 GBBus width192-bit128-bit128-bitBandwidth228 GB/s152 GB/s152 GB/sImage Signal ProcessorQualcomm Spectra ISPQualcomm Spectra ISPQualcomm Spectra ISPCellular Modem-RFSnapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF SystemSnapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF SystemSnapdragon X75 5G Modem-RF SystemConnectivityUp to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Up to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4Up to Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4The X2 Elite chip supports Qualcomm's x75 5G modem-RG system, with up to 10 Gbps peak downloads.

Notably, Qualcomm's images and a sizzle reel both suggest that the X2 Elite will appear in both laptops and mini PCs.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.
(Image credit: Qualcomm)It's been over a year since the initial batch of Snapdragon X Elite chips were announced. Subsequently, a full lineup including the X Plus (in both 10-core and 8-core variants) and a standard Snapdragon X chip were released. The top-end chips appeared in designs from major manufacturers, including Microsoft, Samsung, Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, and Acer.The initial chips showed off their efficiency through long battery life, and we hope to see the X2 SoCs build on that. They didn't, however, work with some applications (namely games) and we want to see better emulation support there. Windows on Arm, however, didn't exactly take over the market, so we'll see what the new chips bring to the table.Qualcomm is announcing these chips pretty early. The Snapdragon Summit comes ahead of Apple's next major release (Apple is Qualcomm's biggest rival in Arm-based systems), which is rumored to be early next year. And of course, by the time many X2 devices make it to market in the first half of 2026, AMD and Intel may also have next-gen x86 chips ready to compete.Next year is shaping up to be an eventful one for those looking to buy a new laptop, which should be good for consumers and the industry as a whole. After a fairly quiet 2025 on the mobile front, it’ll also be nice to have some fresh silicon to test.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Oh hey, a chip maker finally tried out a triple-channel (technically 6), 192-bit DDR5 mem bus.
I hope that means the Adreno X2-90 can push some numbers.
The X1-85 was middling in 2023, much less 2024 when it actually launched.

Cool. Hope to see some ~~ATX boards this time around.

Big deal, they're still way too expensive for what you get. Between Apple M4 and modern Windows x86 chips there's just way too much tradeoff to go Windows Snapdragon instead for the crazy price some manufacturers (Microsoft especially) want for them, and that's not even considering things like compatibility and gaming (even light gaming), and the fact that they're not exactly hugely more battery efficient than some x86 models as TH and TG pointed out in their reviews.
People wanted Snapdragon to bring Apple M levels of performance, battery life, and price to Windows, and it has not delivered.

The article said:After a fairly quiet 2025 on the mobile front, it’ll also be nice to have some fresh silicon to test.Arrow Lake-H launched this year. You wouldn't know it by browsing ark.intel.com, where the index seems to be missing a couple generations, but here:
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/241749/intel-core-ultra-5-processor-225h-18m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz/specifications.html
Ryzen AI Max (Strix Halo) also launched this year. That was a pretty big deal, IMO.

Funny enough, I seem to recall I even mentioned the idea of Snapdragon going up to triple-channel, in another recent thread about either that or the A19 benchmark leaks. Can't seem to find it, though. (Edit: I think it was actually about a future Nvidia SoC potentially using 3x SOCAMM to reach 384-bits).
Anyway, Apple dropped the DRAM data width of its M3 Pro to 192-bits, whereas the M1 Pro and M2 Pro were both 256-bits.

I'm a little surprised to see BlueTooth 5.4 there. BlueTooth 6 has started to roll out in other ARM based SoCs.

What's the point of introducing a chip today without BT6? It's a year old by now, and everyone wants it for their next phone/buds pairing. They aren't going to settle for less on a laptop!

If those GPU claims are true, partner with Valve to put it on a SteamOS handheld. Thats going to get you better ARM compatibility than with Windows.
The gen 1 SD Elite chip, when running a native ARM game or a highly compatible one, had performance about as good as AMD's 780m (what powers the Asus Ally and Legion Go)
