We've seen a lot of great deals and sales on SSD in recent months. But larger forces, like tariffs and geopolitical issues, threaten push prices higher in the coming months. For now, there are big discounts to be had on 4TB and 8TB SSD models that continue to supply 5 cents per GB prices on the best-value drives, and 6 cents per GB if you'd like a more premium 8TB drive.
Below, we list all the current 4TB and 8TB PCIe 4 and PCIe 5 SSDs we could find for sale, and we keep this list updated regularly. Many of these drives also make an appearance on our list of the Best SSDs, and you'll find plenty of other deals on smaller, more affordable SSDs in our Best SSD deals 2025 hub.When buying an SSD, the drive you choose not to buy can be the most important decision you make — there's an entire constellation of trashy knock-offs that can and often do fail rather quickly, taking your data with it. You can rest assured, these SSDs in our list are worth buying - we don't list bargain-basement drives that will threaten the safety of your data. We select deals based on our in-depth knowledge, gained from years of thorough reviews, expansive benchmarks, and extensive historical price analysis.You can peruse the list below and click on the bold blue price text in the table to see the deals:

What if you want to take the next step up? You can grab an 8TB SSD for as little as $0.06 per GB. The best choice here is the WD Black SN850X, a PCIe 4.0 drive that reads and writes at about 7,200 MB/s. That drive is one of the best of the bunch, and it's selling at an all-time low price.

If you can afford an 8TB drive, you'll be future-proofed for many years. However, 4TB is likely the sweet spot between price and capacity for most people. And of course, if you have more than one M.2 slot, you can always buy two 4TB drives for less than one 8TB drive.

Hate to tell you Avram but the "$TooExpensive" price on the Sabrent Rocket 8TB is actually $935 after applied 15% coupon, making it only 11.6¢/GB, or $799 for "Like New" from Sabrent's Amazon store, making it 9.9¢/GB.

Those prices aren't any different than 6 months ago.

Then it'll make sense, as to why this article is garbage.
Storage prices have always been denoted in TB/.
This article is a pure ad. Reflinks and clickbait denotation. In saner times, users would've booted the author off the page.

That is false. Even PCPP uses Price/GB. That has been the standard long before there was such a thing as TB drives.

I'm prepared to pay 3 cents per gigabyte, like it was when prices dipped a couple years back.
Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like that will happen anytime soon, unless you find lucky clearance.

On the demand side, the AI bubble popping would help.
Samsung developing 400-plus-layer 3D NAND
We're seeing about 300-400 layers today, with 800-1000 plausible by around 2030.

Price per TB is a clear and concise denotation, of how much you're getting screwed as a customer. Price comp. portals use it as an example.
Are you calculating your fruit purchases in price per microgram too ??
