A premium ultrawide monitor not only gives you more screen real estate but also makes multitasking and productivity easier without switching between multiple displays. Additionally, it enhances your gaming or movie-watching experience with immersive visuals. One such offering is the 39-inch LG Ultragear OLED, which is currently on sale and is available at its lowest price ever on Amazon.Launched earlier this year in April, the LG Ultragear 39GX90SA is currently priced at $899, which is a significant saving considering its launch price of $1,599. While the monitor has seen price drops in recent months, this is the lowest we’ve ever seen it go.

Got last year's model of this for $549 (with a $70 MS/Xbox credit too) new through Costco a few months ago, good deal for the price, just know text displays awfully, you can get it decent with tweaks but not great (and I'm comparing to a Alienware 3423dwf qdoled that many claim isn't great, but I didn't notice text issues on it at 125% scaling)
