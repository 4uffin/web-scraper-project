Sorry, your one-year-old CPU is already on the back burner.

Raptor Lake CPU

Intel announced that it will transition the integrated graphics on 11th- to 14th-generation processors to a legacy software support model, relegating its last-generation chips to the back burner. The company says that it will no longer release new features for these chips and will only provide software support for critical fixes and security vulnerabilities. It also reduces the update release cadence for the iGPUs from monthly to quarterly, and they will also lose Day 0 Game support.This announcement affects both desktops and laptop chips. The 11th to 14th-generation Intel CPUs are still relatively new — the 14th-generation Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs first arrived in 2023, with new models released just last year, while the 11th-generation Tiger Lake processors launched in 2020. In effect, Intel is saying that your one-year-old Intel Core i5-14400 is already on the back burner.While an unwelcome move, the company is likely making this change to conserve resources and focus on its newer Arc graphics architecture. After all, Intel has cut 4,000 positions in the U.S. alone so far this year, with thousands of technicians and engineers being let go as the company fights hard for its survival.

Still, many customers might feel betrayed; after all, if you bought a new processor, you expect it to be supported for at least five to seven years. This announcement will not brick your PC, and you still get critical and security updates quarterly. But you’re also not getting new features, and you might have issues with (or possibly not even be able to play) the latest games at launch.Nevertheless, many users will likely not feel this. After all, gamers who typically download, install, and play a AAA game at launch most often have a discrete GPU installed on their system. In fact, even the most hardware-friendly titles, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6, require a modest graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 2060, AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT, or Intel Arc A380.Even though it makes sense for Intel to focus on its newer Core and Core Ultra chips, the fact that Intel is moving such a relatively new CPU line-up to legacy support could leave a bad taste in the mouths of some users.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

This is why I mentioned before that Intel has no business being in the discrete GPU market. They will simply not be able to bring a product on the market than can remotely compete with either Nvidia or AMD offering.
They should concentrate on other things, not on the discrete GPU market.
And if they want to keep their market share for IGPU they better smarten up because AMD is ready to take that any time.

Count me amongst the owners that don't care that the iGPU that offered poor gaming performance when I bought it might struggle to play new game titles. The only thing I want from my iGPU is stable OS drivers and the ability to watch videos smoothly.

So no zero day support for igpus that don't meet the minimum requirements for any of these AAA games.
I'm shocked!
My performance playing the latest unreal 5 game at 4k might lose .1 fps or 10%. Woe is me.

The thing is the discrete GPU side is where they are learning the most, and applying it to iGPU. Intel themselves have said as such. The B580 is quite competitive for the intended price point. For a second generation part, they have done quite well, with regards to performance improvement, and driver support. The latest Arc base iGPU can hang on pretty well vs an 8500g. Considering how little time they have spent working on Arc, that's pretty impressive. The days of having a useless iGPU are over if they keep the discrete side going.

Thank goodness I have Ubuntu on my systems! My Ivy Bridge (3rd gen) desktop still gets driver updates, let alone my 11th gen notebook (supported by both the iris driver which supports basically 11th gen and older, and Xe driver which supports 11th gen and newer.)
I mean people joke here, but plenty of people play on Steam Deck, The intel iGPUs aren't that great but by 11th gen range from a bit but not much slower (in the low end) to somewhat faster (on the high end.). Haven't tried one in Windows but in Linux it's perfectly acceptable for gaming.

With 0% market share and a Company on the brink of collapse, it does not sound wise to stay invested in discrete GPU hardware...

"Within the discrete graphics card sector, NVIDIA achieved a remarkable 92% share of the add-in board (AIB) GPU market in the first quarter of 2025, according to data released by Jon Peddie Research (JPR). This represents an 8.5% increase compared to NVIDIA's previous position. By contrast, AMD's share contracted to just 8%, down 7.3 points, while Intel's presence effectively disappeared, falling to 0% after losing 1.2 points"
With 0% market share and trying to compete with a 4.46 Trillion USD valued Company, it's not sound advice to continue development of GPU hardware considering the position Intel is in as a Company.
They should focus on their strengths, not their weaknesses. I am all in favor of competition in the market, but when it comes to discrete GPU's there's no real competition. It's either green or red, blue is out.

With 0% market share and a Company on the brink of collapse, it does not sound wise to stay invested in discrete GPU hardware...The recent federal investment.. well I didn't see that as a positive but did give them some breathing room (worried about running too low on cash before their new fabs come online). And the Nvidia investment is a REAL positive I think.
That said, that market share dropping from 1.2% to 0% sure didn't look good -- but, if I were getting a GPU now I'd STRONGLY consider an ARC. (I am running Linux though so I won't have to worry about Intel deciding maybe they won't bother supporting it in a year or two like they are apparently doing to Windows users with these iGPUs.)
Nvidia and AMD have virtually abandoned the low and mid range, and it's nice that ARC does not skimp on the VRAM. Some of these AMD and Nvidia cards, it's like yeah this model is faster, but the games that need that speed are also going to want more VRAM than they have on them.
I'm not really disagreeing with you -- I'm just hoping ARC does not go of the market. I think one thing that helps here, they have so much hardware in common with their AI offerings that I imagine it's almost "a freebie" to also produce graphics cards.
