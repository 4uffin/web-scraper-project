My personal favorite flash drive, and the best flash drive we've tested, SK hynix's Tube T31, is down to a new low price of $118 at Amazon. It's one of the fastest USB-A flash drives we've ever tested and a great choice for people looking for a convenient storage solution that is compact and plugs right into any USB Type-A port, while delivering great performance. It's technically a tiny external SSD, but the Tube T31 keeps the familiar (and handily cable-free) USB flash drive form factor.The Tube T31 2TB flash drive is 26% off, taking it down to a new low price of $118. And if you want to spend less and don't need 2TB, the 1TB Tube T31 is also down to $59, although that's not a new low price. While some will prefer USB-C, the Tube T31's ultra-prevalent USB Type-A connector makes it easy to use with a host of everyday computing devices, as well as consoles, and it's a great backup or offline data transfer tool.
SK hynix Tube T31 2TB: was $159 now $118 at AmazonA super-compact SSD on a stick, the Tube T31 brings together a 2TB drive with a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 connector that offers speeds of up to 1,000MB/s (10Gbps). This drive is compatible with PS4, PS5, Xbox, Windows PC & Mac. Perfect for your portable storage needs.Read moreâ–¼View Deal
I reviewed the 1TB Tube T31 in 2024 and gave it an Editor's Choice award for its performance. It's a little bulky for a flash drive, and could block neighboring USB ports, particularly on a desktop. But most laptops should have adjacent USB-C ports spaced far enough apart. And the Tube T31 did deliver class-leading performance compared to its peers and, turning in some of the fastest transfer speeds available for a 10 Gbps USB-A drive.

The SK hynix Tube T31 2TB uses its impressive performance to blur the lines between external SSDs and flash drives in terms of both speed and capacity. It uses a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A connector, making it compatible with basically any recent device with a USB-A port, and utilizes the full 10 Gbps data bandwidth available, providing speeds of up to 1,000MB/s when transferring your data.

IMO, what's most intriguing about this product is how it's basically a M.2 2242 NVMe drive attached via USB adapter.

That M.2 drive seems to be a very decent SSD. AFAICT, it's basically an OEM version of SK Hynix's P31 Gold, which uses TLC. That said, I wouldn't be too surprised if the manufacturer changed the precise model of M.2 drive they're now putting in these tubes, though I hope it's at least still a TLC model.

Iâ€™ve done a very exhaustive search (including industrial SSDs) and SKHynix is the only SSD manufacturer that makes any M.2 2230 SSD this small with DRAM. The one inside of these USB drives are 2242 as shown in Tomâ€™s Hardwareâ€™s tear-down, but they come in 2230 form factor as well (used in other OEM devices). All are part of the SK Hynix BC711 series. If this 2 TB model continues the same design from the 1 TB whether it is the same or new M.2 series, Iâ€™m holding out hope that the M.2 2230 versions are also floating out there somewhere. Folks have confirmed that the 1 TB ones have DRAM in a few places.

It ticked all the boxes: low cost, low power, decent performance (plenty for the Pi 5, at least), and not QLC.

Hmm, I'm currently using Sabrent NVME Enclosures with DIY cooling holes drilled into them (really dropped sustained Temps - holes are above the Controller area where there is no heat-sink contact) and various 2-4TB NVME drives for relatives Macrium backups (5 PC + 3 Laptops).
Was going to update all my enclosures to the same 4 TB NVME Drives with hopefully Black Friday Sales (Tariffs Willing) but I wonder if these could handle the Macrium Backups heat wise instead?
Talking about up to 1TB sustained backup writes.

: D
I like drilling holes in stuff, too. Added some "speed holes" to a passively-cooled multi-gig switch, recently.
