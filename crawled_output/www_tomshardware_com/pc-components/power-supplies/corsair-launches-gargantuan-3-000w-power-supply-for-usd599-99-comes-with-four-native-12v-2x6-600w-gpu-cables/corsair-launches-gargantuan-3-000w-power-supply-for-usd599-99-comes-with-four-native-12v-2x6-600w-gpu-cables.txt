Corsair has introduced the brand's first power supply exceeding 1,600W. The latest WS3000, featuring a capacity of 3,000W and 80 Plus Platinum-certified, is engineered to support systems and workstations equipped with multi-GPU configurations.With dimensions measuring 6.9 x 5.9 x 3.4 inches (175 x 150 x 86 mm), the WS3000 constitutes a standard ATX 3.1 power supply that adheres to the PCIe 5.1 specification. Its length of 6.9 inches positions the WS3000 as potentially one of the most compact 3,000W power supplies available, facilitating installation within even conventional ATX cases. Like many contemporary high-end units, the WS3000 is equipped with a modular design, thus simplifying cable management.The WS3000 boasts a power capacity of 3,000W and features a single-rail design. This configuration indicates that the power supply provides up to 250A on the +12V rail. It is essential to note that the WS3000 is designed for 220-240V operation; therefore, it is imperative to ensure that your residence is wired for 240V and has a circuit that complies with the specifications. Consequently, the WS3000 employs a C19 power cable, which has a physically larger connector and is rated for a higher current (16A compared to 10A), as opposed to the standard C13 power cable used with typical power supplies.

The WS3000 is not the first or only Corsair power supply to utilize the C19 power cable. Numerous high-capacity units from the brand, such as the HX1500i and AX1600i, have already employed the C19 power cable.Image 1 of 4(Image credit: Corsair)(Image credit: Corsair)(Image credit: Corsair)(Image credit: Corsair)The WS3000 leverages a 140mm double-ball-bearing fan for active cooling. However, it does not have the Zero RPM mode found in consumer models. This is because Corsair considers noise reduction a lower priority for the WS3000's use case. Additionally, it does not support iCUE, so you won't be able to monitor or control the WS3000 through Corsair's software.Designed to support multi-GPU configurations, the WS3000 is equipped with four native 12V-2x6 power cables, specifically designed for contemporary graphics cards that utilize the 12VHPWR power connector. Furthermore, the power supply provides four dual 8-pin PCIe power cables, totaling eight 8-pin PCIe power connectors. Additionally, it includes two 8-pin EPS power connectors intended for high-end or workstation motherboards with power-hungry processors.Corsair backs the WS3000 (CP-9020312-NA) with a limited ten-year warranty. The power supply has an MSRP of $599.99; however, we've seen it listed at Central Computer, a U.S. retailer, for $549.99, so it's possible to acquire the power supply for below MSRP.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Time for the entire PC industry to move from 12V to 24, 36 or even 48V. For 12V game is over

That will have the same GPU melting connector issues as the other PSU systems. And with the same huge GPU/ATX ground loop design error, it can damage the motherboard easier if the GPU return current takes the PCIe path back through the ATX power cable. They really need to stop using paralleled wiring for this kind of usage, and consider making the GPU power path isolated to break the ground loop. This isn't just an Nvidia problem - it also includes the PSU designs.
Here is another TH article where I discuss these issues, including my finding that most of the GPU cable damage is occurring on the 12V supply wires and not the returns:

Does that come with an electrician in the US to run a 220/240V circuit for your computer?

By the way Corsair site claims for its 1500W PSU HX1500i the same input voltage
AC INPUT : 200‚Äì240V
Typo?
It actually also works with 110V
