The set includes:Original Apple-1 board, marked on the reverse with "01-0020"Original Apple Cassette Interface (ACI) boardOriginal Byte Shop wooden case with built-in Datanetics keyboard and Triad power supplyPeriod-correct video monitor and associated cablesPeriod-correct copies of software on cassette tapes, with contemporary handwritten notes and instructionsModern copy of the Apple-1 Operation ManualAs it stands, this rare computer would be a desirable item, but its appeal is lifted further because it was owned by the first female graduate of Stanford Law School, June Blodgett Moore.The condition of the computer is graded at 8.0/10 by the auction house. As such an old tech artifact, there are issues impacting the score. For example, RR Auctions notes a hairline crack on part of the case and a section of rear paneling that has been removed to provide access to cabling.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: RR Auctions)(Image credit: RR Auctions)(Image credit: RR Auctions)Inside, this Apple-1 is a great period example. The auctioneers point out that the PCB is marked ‘Apple Computer 1, Palo Alto, Ca. Copyright 1976’ and its breadboard prototyping area “is untouched and the green coat exhibits some minor scuffs but minimal peeling, unlike many Apple-1 boards.” Other points of note are its white ceramic MOS 6502 processor and all three original Sprague 'Big Blue' capacitors. Some power supply diodes have been replaced, but carefully swapped with period-correct replacements.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: RR Auctions)(Image credit: RR Auctions)Wooden case historyThe wooden case seen used for this model was implemented to elevate the Apple-1 beyond being a Homebrew Computer Club kit aimed at DIYers. The Byte Shop in Mountain View, California, insisted on completed kits being supplied for its retail operation. Steve Jobs and Steve ‘Woz’ Wozniak complied by supplying 50 units in this wooden case. It would be one of the first personal computers available to consumers that didn’t require assembly.The retail deal meant that The Byte Shop bought 50 Apple-1 computers in wood cases for $500 a piece, and resold them at $666.66. Wozniak would recount, “That was the biggest single episode in all of the company's history. Nothing in subsequent years was so great and so unexpected.”Steven Jobs CheckAnother Apple-flavored auction that concludes on Saturday is for a 'Steven Jobs' signed Apple Computer Company check. The check was drawn up for $10 on June 25, 1976. At this time, the company was still operating from the Jobs family garage.
(Image credit: RR Auctions)This check is encapsulated and graded as a ‘Mint 9’ and was expected to fetch $25,000. However, it has already hit $24,655 in pre-live bidding, so it should go somewhat higher on SaturdayFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.
