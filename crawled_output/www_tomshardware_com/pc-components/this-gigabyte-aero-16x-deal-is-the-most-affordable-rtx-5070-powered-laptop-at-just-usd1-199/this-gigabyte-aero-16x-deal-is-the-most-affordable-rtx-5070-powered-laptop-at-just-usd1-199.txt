The latest range of laptops with Nvidia’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs can be anything but affordable. However, the Gigabyte Aero 16X might be worth considering as it is currently on sale at Best Buy. You can grab the 16-inch notebook for $1,199, down from its launch price of $1,649 which saves you $450. This also makes this the cheapest RTX 5070 powered laptop that you can buy right now.The Aero 16X is primarily meant for creative professionals and is powered by AMD’s Zen 5 Krackan Point Ryzen AI 7 350 processor, featuring 8 cores, 16 threads, and a boost clock speed of 5 GHz. It’s paired with Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Laptop GPU, configured at 85W TGP, which is slightly below the chip’s maximum power draw of 115W. Despite that, the Aero 16X should be capable enough to handle many modern games smoothly at QHD resolution.

Great that in his review the reviewer cares about what is important for computer enthusiasts :
- is RAM soldered into motherboard or upgradable
- if upgradable then to what maximum RAM
- same if SSD soldered or upgradable
- what are powerful GPU options
Shops and even manufacturers often hide or do not care about these details.
This is important to keep with time not being obsolete same moment you bought your laptop specifically now when AI demands RAM and GPU power

Notebookcheck reviewed that laptop and found it wasn't a bad buy, with the major negatives being the camera and audio, which are common negatives to many laptops, but having a 96% sRGB display, little over 8 hours of battery life, and decent gaming performance.

It’s paired with Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Laptop GPU, configured at 85W TGP, which is slightly below the chip’s maximum power draw of 115W.
You're looking at the 5070Ti, the vanilla 5070 has a TGP of 100w, so 85w isn't horrible and brings in RTX 4070 levels of performance per Notebookcheck.

According to that reviewer, it has 2 ram slots but only 1 populated. You could buy an unmatched single dimm to double the ram. RAM on laptops usually run at base speed anyways.
I can see a single full size 2280 M.2 SSD drive. But it may have an additional smaller M.2.
