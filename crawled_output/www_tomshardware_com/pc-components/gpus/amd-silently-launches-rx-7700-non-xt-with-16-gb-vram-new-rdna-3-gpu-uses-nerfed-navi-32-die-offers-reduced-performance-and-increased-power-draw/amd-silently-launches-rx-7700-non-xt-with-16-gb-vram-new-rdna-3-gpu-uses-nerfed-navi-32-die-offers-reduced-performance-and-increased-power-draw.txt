If you thought RDNA 3 was done, think again, because AMD has just refreshed the lineup with a brand new SKU — the RX 7700 non-XT. Listed silently on its website without any announcement, the RX 7700 comes with 16 GB of GDDR6 memory saturated across a 256-bit bus, compared to the 7700 XT's relatively meager 12 GB (across 192-bit). AMD has used 19.5 Gbps chips, so, combined with the aforementioned specs, that puts the memory bandwidth on par with the 7800 XT, at 624 GB/s.
(Image credit: Future)The GPU under the hood is a cut-down version of Navi 32 with just 2,560 Stream Processors and 40 Compute Units. The 7700 XT uses the same Navi 32 but has 3,456 Stream Processors and 54 CUs; it also has more ROPs and TMUs (see table at the end), and 48 MB Infinity Cache compared to just 40 MB on the RX 7700. Moreover, there are 80 AI accelerators on the RX 7700, which isn't impressive on its own, but when you combine that with the 16 GB memory pool, this could become a sleeper option for local AI applications.In terms of performance, AMD lists FPS numbers for a bunch of different games, showing a ~20% decrease in gaming compared to the 7700 XT (when taking into account games that overlap). Not only that, but the RX 7700 seems to be less efficient too, eating up 263W of power (versus 245W on the 7700 XT) despite the reduced performance. That leaves local AI inference the only real selling point for this SKU, if it's priced right to begin with. There are dual 8-pin connectors on board, and AMD recommends a 700W power supply for the RX 7700.

Therefore, launching the RX 7700 non-XT at anything more than ~$350 would seriously cannibalise the lineup, rendering it DoA.Swipe to scroll horizontallyRDNA 3 70-class specsGPU SpecsRadeon RX 7700Radeon RX 7700 XTRadeon RX 7800 XTStream Processors2,5603,4563,840Compute Units405460VRAM16GB GDDR612GB GDDR616GB GDDR6Memory Bus256-bit192-bit256-bitBandwidth624 GB/sec432 GB/sec624 GB/secGPU Game / Boost Clock2,041 MHz / 2,459 MHz2,171 MHz / 2,544MHz2,124 MHz / 2,430 MHzInfinity Cache40 MB48 MB64 MBAI Accelerators80 (1st Gen)108 (1st Gen)120 (1st Gen)Texture Mapping Units (TMU)649696Render Output Units (ROP)160216240TBP263 W245 W263 WFollow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Wait, how can that be right? What I'm seeing here is:
FEWER stream processors than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
FEWER compute units than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
FEWER AI accelerators than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
FEWER TMUs than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
FEWER ROPs than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
LOWER Game Clock than the the 7700 XT or 7800 XT
Boost clock 29MHz more than the 7800 XT, but 85MHz less than the 7700 XT
The SAME amount of VRAM as the 7800 XT
The SAME memory bandwidth as the 7800 XT
The SAME memory bus as the 7800 XTI don't understand how it's possible this thing can consume the SAME amount of power as the 7800 XT.
Is it a mistake? Did AMD just copy the 7800 XT's TBP rating when they copied over all the VRAM information for the web page?
That this performs less than the 7700 XT clearly means that the increased memory and bandwidth benefit was more than overwhelmed by the cut down Navi 32.
If it's not a mistake, then this a pretty terrible card. But I'm hoping someone can clarify, because I don't understand how this thing can have the same TBP as the 7800 XT.

I was coming down on the side of "it's just a page that never got updated or indexed" but ASRock has a 7700 non-XT card with the same specs - the RX 7700 Challenger 16GB.
And that is linked on the Challenger product page.
Looks like it's all real.
Edit: And now that I read the article properly it already mentions the ASRock Challenger card.

Why does it have the same memory specs as the 7800 XT? Maybe because it will make it more desirable than another 12 GB model, and they just can. Maybe GDDR6 costs are falling.
Eventually, someone will encounter a situation where having an extra 4 GB of VRAM overcomes the large chunk of performance lost from the 7700 XT. Not sure if the extra bandwidth will ever be useful though.
Overclocking could also help bridge the gap, and having the same rated TBP could mean better overclocking potential.

Is it a mistake? Did AMD just copy the 7800 XT's TBP rating when they copied over all the VRAM information for the web page?With all the dynamic voltage adjustments most modern GPUs do and multiple clock ratings for base/boost/game, TBPs are a bit of a mess. With no framerate cap, most cards will attempt to push clocks and voltages as hard as they can despite diminishing returns, until either power or thermals kicks in.
And while it's not a LOT of power, the extra memory controller die and extra memory chips do add a few watts, and they're probably using a stockpile of absolutely terrible yields.

Regardless what world thinks of AMD they have special spot in my heart. They gave us 9800x3d and they vould have easily charged at least $1500 instead they stayed humble at $479. I had this CPU since March and not one hiccup. No strange crashes or stuttering. They also release a lot more affordable GPU's.
Nvidia on the other hand is all about profit. Who's to be blamed for that? We the consumers gave Intel and Nvidia loyalty and all we got is insane prices and unreliable product.
I think we should back AMD for a change.

Guessing it's just using some defective silicon that doesn't pass for a 7800 XT.
Does add confusion for enthusiasts, but for normal buyers, they get bigger number = better and XT = better than non-XT in the AMD world, though some would still be scratching their head on the non-XT 7700 having more VRAM than the XT model. Could AMD have might the cut-off higher on cores, making it a slower 7800 XT and thus calling it something like 7800 SE? ATI used suffixes like 'GTO' and 'SE' in the past to denote cut-down cards.

I think we should back AMD for a change.That’s a nice story, but let’s be real...AMD isn’t some selfless charity staying humble for the gamers. The 9800X3D at $479 wasn’t about kindness, it was about market pressure. If they really thought they could sell it at $1500, they would. Same with their GPUs, when AMD has performance leadership, they price accordingly just look at the 7900 XTX launch vs the 4090.
Nvidia and Intel don’t set prices in a vacuum, the market does. Consumers drive pricing, competition keeps it in check. Pretending AMD is your friend while Nvidia and Intel are the bad guys is just fanboy spin. At the end of the day, all three are billion-dollar corporations chasing profit.
Support whichever company is offering the best product for your needs at the time...not because you’ve romanticized one of them.

OT:
The 7700XT is sitting at $330, while the 7600XT is $299. I’m really curious where this new card is going to land in pricing.
AMD’s lineup feels all over the place right now...why would anyone pick up a 7600XT when, for just $30 more, you can get a 7700XT? It doesn’t make sense on paper… but then again, we’re talking about AMD’s pricing strategy here. :rolleyes:
I guess, $315....lol
