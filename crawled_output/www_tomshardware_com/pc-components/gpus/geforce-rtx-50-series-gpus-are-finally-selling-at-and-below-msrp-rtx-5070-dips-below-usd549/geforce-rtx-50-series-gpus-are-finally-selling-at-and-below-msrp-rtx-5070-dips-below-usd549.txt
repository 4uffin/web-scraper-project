The GeForce RTX 50 series (codenamed Blackwell) offers some of the best graphics cards you can find on the market today. It's great news that the prices for some of these Blackwell-based graphics cards have finally leveled out, making it easier for everyone to purchase them at or even below Nvidia's MSRP.The GeForce RTX 5070 launched several months ago at an MSRP of $549; however, it has proven challenging for consumers to acquire it at that specified price point. Nonetheless, a selection of customized GeForce RTX 5070 models from some of Nvidia's leading partners is presently available for purchase at prices below $549.The Asus Prime RTX 5070 12GB GDDR7, in particular, is among the notable highlights of the day. This 2.5-slot graphics card, which conforms to the Nvidia SFF-ready standard, is presently available for purchase at $523, representing a 14% discount from its usual retail price. However, for enthusiasts preferring Nvidia's design, the GeForce RTX 5070 Founders Edition has been restocked at Best Buy for $549.

Rather than official price cuts, these promotional offers are likely aimed at clearing inventory in anticipation of the rumored Super refresh. However, many consumers have expressed concerns that Nvidia's Blackwell gaming graphics cards are priced excessively; therefore, bringing the pricing back down to MSRP may not effectively incentivize purchases. Perhaps these Blackwell GPUs will look more convincing when retailers start offering genuine discounts rather than merely reverting elevated prices to MSRP.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Living in Greece and looking at RTX 50-series prices in dollarsâ€¦ the 5090 at â‚¬2,567.60 might as well come with its own zip code! ðŸ˜… The 5070 Ti is $749 in the US, seems reasonableâ€¦ here itâ€™s â‚¬824.79 â€“ basically, in Greece youâ€™re paying for the deluxe package with free coffee and GPU hospitality. The 5080 is $999 in the US, here â‚¬1,149â€¦ probably comes with a personal assistant to install the drivers. And the 5060 Ti? $429 and $379 in the US, here â‚¬591.14 â€“ yep, this GPU even teaches math to justify its price! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¸

Too late. Maybe they could try harder to have FE models actually in stock for regular gamers to buy within the 1st year of launch. Supers are coming soon which makes the value of the regular 50 series even worse. I got tired of waiting and got a used 4080 super instead. Has working 32 bit physx plus a safe power connector as a bonus.
