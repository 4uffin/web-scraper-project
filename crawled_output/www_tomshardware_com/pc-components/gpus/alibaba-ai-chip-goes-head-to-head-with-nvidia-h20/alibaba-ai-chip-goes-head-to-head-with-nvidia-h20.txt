A state TV broadcast puts Alibaba’s PPU side-by-side with Nvidia’s H20, but the claim rests entirely on optics.

Alibaba’s semiconductor unit, T-Head, has reportedly developed a new AI processor that it claims matches the performance of Nvidia’s H20 — the GPU built specifically for the Chinese market that’s currently stuck in geopolitical purgatory. The demonstration aired Tuesday, September 16, on China Central Television (CCTV), during a broadcast covering Premier Li Qiang’s visit to China Umicom’s Sanjiangyuan Energy Intelligent Computing Centre in Qinghai. In the segment, T-Head’s new “PPU” accelerator was directly compared with Nvidia’s H20 and A800, as well as Huawei’s Ascend 910B, with a chart implying performance parity between the Alibaba and Nvidia parts. The chip, an ASIC designed for AI workloads, features 96 GB of HBM2e, 700 GB/s chip-to-chip interconnect, PCIe support, and 400 W board power, according to the on-screen specs as reported by South China Morning Post. While the broadcast didn’t disclose the specifics of the testing methodology used or publish raw figures, it’s the first public benchmark placing Alibaba’s hardware in the same class as Nvidia’s datacenter GPUs. According to Reuters, China Unicom has already deployed 16,384 of Alibaba’s PPU cards across its infrastructure, accounting for more than half of the almost 23,000 domestic accelerators currently installed at the Qinghai facility. Together, the cards deliver 3,579 petaflops of compute, with the site expected to scale to more than 20,000 petaflops once all phases are complete.There’s just as much geopolitical context behind the CCTV demonstration as there is technical. Nvidia’s H20 was introduced to comply with U.S. export controls limiting the sale of high-performance silicon to China. Built on Hopper architecture but cut down to meet restrictions, the H20 ships with 96 GB of HBM3 and roughly 4.0 TB/s of memory bandwidth. That lends some perspective to Alibaba’s matching 96 GB HBM2e capacity, though not necessarily its real-world performance. The biggest unknown right now is on the software side. While Alibaba is understandably eager to show it can meet AI hardware needs in-house, the company has not disclosed details about frameworks, toolchains, or compatibility with existing model stacks. Until independent benchmarks and developer support materialize, the PPU’s parity with Nvidia’s hardware is just a claim backed by Chinese state TV and endorsed by the Chinese government.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

China isn't just catching up—it's overtaking. While U.S. policies stifle innovation through export controls, China’s relentless focus on semiconductor self-reliance has already produced AI chips that humiliate Nvidia’s deliberately crippled H20. This isn’t a demonstration—it’s a declaration. With massive state-backed deployment, rapid iteration, and a total commitment to technological sovereignty, China isn’t playing for parity—it’s racing toward dominance. The era of Western semiconductor supremacy is ending. The question isn’t if China will lead, but how soon the world will be running on Chinese silicon.

When Nvidia fear the chinese chip, Belive they will launch something way far ahead from today solutions.
Chinese coal power will not pass...

I recall seeing that HBM was sanctioned. Does that include the HBM2E that's used in this card?
