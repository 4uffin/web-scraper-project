The sheer amount of times that people have received everything but the high-end GPU they ordered is frankly too absurd to count at this point. We've already seen metal blocks being delivered instead of a graphics card, pasta and rice packaged inside a 5090 box, and a 5070 Ti that was actually just a bag of salt. In comparison to that, receiving just a bland ol' brick instead of an RTX 5080 seems almost uninspired, but that's exactly what happened to u/GlassHistorical5303.Our victim (who we'll call Glass for ease) ordered a PNY GeForce RTX 5080 from the firm's official store on Amazon. Unfortunately, what they got was a brick wrapped up in the same anti-static bag that the actual GPU usually comes in. Apart from the obvious implication that someone at the factory might've swapped the card, this actually suggests that a reverse-scam was in effect here. Someone may have gotten the real 5080 they wanted, took it out of the box, replaced it with a brick, and returned it to Amazon who didn't bother to properly check the contents.Amazon sent me a brick instead of a 5080 from r/pcmasterraceYou might be wondering how a returned package could be thrown in with the new stuff that's supposed to come from PNY’s official store — this is where the issue of "commingling" comes in. That term refers to merging items from different sellers and channels into a single, unified inventory that makes the job super easy for logistics but remains effectively untracked. All the scammer needs to do is match the box’s weight, replacing the 5080 with an identically heavy brick, and the scales tip in their favor (no pun intended).

In this case, though, perhaps the bricked 5080 box was actually sent ahead by mistake when it should've been caught at the warehouse. Either that or, of course, an Amazon worker genuinely saw the opportunity and took the GPU for themselves. Whatever the case may be, Glass has already filed for a refund, and we hope they get it as soon as possible. While we often find the fiasco entertaining — top comment called this GPU-brick the "Foundation Edition" — it's anything but that for the end user who is now just a sitting duck to the whims of customer service.Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time someone has received a brick instead of their GPU as this exact dilemma befell another customer a year ago, when purchasing from Newegg. It's because of growing scams like these that we advise people to stay vigilant, no matter where you're buying from. Especially if you're shopping used, you may not get something strange in the box, but instead a GPU that literally has no core inside it.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Yeah. at least in the past businesses that sell through Amazon had a choice to comingle or not, but commingling was default if they didn't opt out. I assume in return for slightly lower handling fees. Don't do it, your high quality items get thrown in a bin with possibly fraudulent and counterfeit items (like fake SSDs and memory cards). The fraudsters know then they can supply fraudulent items and people who buy from them are highly likely to get other sellers genuine items, and your customer receives their fraudulent item and you get the return.

Amazon has always been good about righting wrongs in shipping. They usually don't even ask any questions when I've had problems.
However, the amount of scams for tech items is through the roof and getting worse. It is safe to assume that any "new" HD ordered is from a data center with 10,000+ hours, even if honored by Amazon itself. Not to mention the myriad of fake SSD's they have listed on there site. Always be sure to open and test any new device as soon as it is delivered, because Amazon does not.

I ordered turbo tank vleaner from Amazon to clean my water heater at home. In the mail I received medical tape instead. At first I thought they messed up the adress and then I checked Amazon website it said tubotank cleane was delivered today at 5:30PM ....I immediately called Amazon and let them know what was in the package and that the item I ordered did not arrive. They immediately replaced my item. I told them this could be honest mistake or someone at Amazon wehouse is stealing stuff. Hopefully its a mistake. Right now I am dealing with PartsGeek.com they sent me wrong part and they are being very difficult. They asking for all these pictures and telling me to wait. I reported them to Visa after I read Reddit reviews and it seams they send a lot of wrong parts to costumers and then refuse to remburse the costumer or send the right part. I told Visa I paid for the item and shipping and merchant is trying to swindle me for $215. So right now Visa is going after them. I will send Visa all documents and pictures. PartsGeek.com are crooks.

Amazon itself is not to blame, it's the crooked stab you in the back greedy humans of this century is to blame.

RTX 5080 Foundation Edition: the only GPU that can handle benchmarks… if you just write them on the brick with a marker. At least it’s future-proof — you can build your house with it too.

Please do yourself a favor and google the merchant and see if someone can confirm they are safe and reputable. Also if you are only person who got cheated share it on Redit. Lets make online buying bit safer.
I highly suggest you record short video with your phone where you basically open the package in front of the delivery person. These online purchases are getting more insane and shady.

For tech , scAmazon is a no-go zone IMO. It's similar to buying memory cards and other stuff from Fleabay, they will nearly always be counterfeit especially if it's Samsung or Sandisk.
