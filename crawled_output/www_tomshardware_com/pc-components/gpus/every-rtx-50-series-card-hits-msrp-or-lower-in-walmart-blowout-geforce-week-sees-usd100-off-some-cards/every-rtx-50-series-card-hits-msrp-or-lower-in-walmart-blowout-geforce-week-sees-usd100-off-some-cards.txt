Gamers and those in need of a new and more powerful graphics card rejoice, for finally, we are seeing some real drops in GPU prices that are actually taking the discounts below that mythical MSRP price. The 50-series RTX GPUs from Nvidia started popping on the market at the start of this year, but it's taken nine months for the cards to have more stock availability and hit the originally announced MSRP prices that were only available for a select few GPUs.The dip in price of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs is thanks to Walmart's GeForce Week sales event, which has knocked the ball out of the park with its swathe of graphics card deals. From the entry-level RTX 5060, all the way up to the fastest gaming GPU on the planet, the RTX 5090, the prices have either been significantly discounted to MSRP or slashed in price well below that threshold.

Yeah Ok
You're recommending a purchase from a Walmart vendor with a 2.1/5 rating and an address in an apartment in Chula Vista, California. Be better.

Warning: I tried to buy the pny 5070 before this article from Walmart and as soon as I hit purchase I got an email that the sale had been canceled but I still haven't gotten the refund. This is sketchy at best
