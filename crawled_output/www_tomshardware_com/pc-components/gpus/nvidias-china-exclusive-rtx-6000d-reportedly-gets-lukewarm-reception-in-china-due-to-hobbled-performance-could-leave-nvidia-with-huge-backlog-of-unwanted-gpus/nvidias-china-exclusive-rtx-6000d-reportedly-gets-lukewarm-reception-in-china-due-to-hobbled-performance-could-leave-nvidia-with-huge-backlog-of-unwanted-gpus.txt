Nvidia's RTX6000D, the China-first card initially designed to fill the void left by the banned (and then unbanned) Nvidia H20, has received very little interest in China, according to Reuters, amidst ongoing trade tensions. Estimates by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley suggest Nvidia may be on track to produce between 1.5 and 2 million of these GPUs before the end of the year, potentially leaving it sitting on a huge stack of unwanted cards.The specific array of graphics cards that Nvidia is allowed to sell to Chinese firms has fluctuated wildly in 2025 as the Trump administration has initiated on-again, off-again tariffs and trade blockages, particularly in relation to high-end technology like GPUs aimed at AI training and inference. To comply with these regulations, Nvidia has churned out Chinese-specific GPUs like the RTX 5090D and H20.The RTX6000D is the latest development in this space, and was reportedly initially designed as a solution to the ban on H20 exports to the country. Although the H20 is now available once again, and Nvidia is talking up its B30A replacement based on the newer Blackwell architecture, the RTX6000D was an additional GPU design that could have found favor among AI firms scrambling for GPU power. But with ongoing trade negotiations and a major drive within China to prioritize domestically produced chips, Nvidia is said to be struggling to find buyers for the new card.

The Reuters sources claim the RTX6000D only started shipping this week, but its performance has been rated lower than Nvidia's bog-standard 5090, which isn't available in China. However, it has been readily available on black and grey markets in China for months now, and there are even modded versions doing the rounds with massively expanded memory capacities for even more AI performance.The RTX6000D is based on the Blackwell architecture and has a memory bandwidth just under the 1,400 Gbps threshold placed on GPU exports to China. At a reported price of 50,000 yuan, or around $7,000, though, it's a hard sell when comparably performative cards are available in variously dubious markets for less than half of that.China has also become increasingly hesitant over Nvidia GPU use in recent months. It accused the US of adding tracking hardware to Nvidia GPUs and even summoned major Chinese CEOs to question them over H20 GPU orders. Chinese authorities most recently even accused Nvidia of violating anti-monopoly legislation in a deal it made in 2020.China and the US continue to discuss trade in Madrid this week, with major points of contention being the sale of high-end GPUs. If the US does approve the sale of Nvidia's B30A GPU, one that's several times faster than the H20 and only around twice the price, that could end up as a huge win for Nvidia - even if it might encourage even weaker interest in the RTX6000D.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

No way was this designed as a replacement for the H20. It's a workstation card that doesn't play well in large clusters. This card is for a very specific niche where the workload fits entirely in 96GB, but is larger than 24/32GB. Usually that means a development workstation with a subset of data for experiments before moving the task to the "big" cluster, but it's not likely to see these deployed in a massive GPU datacenter like the H20.

I'll just say what everyone is thinking: China doesn't like getting the D... models.
Why get the D when you can just get the normal version without many issues anyway! I'm sure nVidia would prefer it that way, since it's full price instead.
Regards.

Sounds like a lot of what if's.
Fairly simple solution for nagreadia produce 250K when / if the supply is almost depleted produce 250K more till the demand drops to not selling hardly any.
But I guess that would be to much of a smart business move for the higher-ups to comprehend.

TSMC schedules chip production far in advance, GPU assembly factories all produce multiple models on shared production lines, and memory needs to be bought in bulk far in advance if you want discounts from spot pricing. Shared dies and shared VRAM gives Nvidia some flexibility to shift production around over the medium-to-long-term, but they can't exactly call up TSMC and say "Oh, can you disable down all of next week's GB202s to be RTX6000Ds, please? We're running low."

I'm sure Nvidia uses its AI to run the MRP. Its Bayesian modeling is working overtime to predict the future.
