Microsoft has announced that it will automatically install the Microsoft 365 Copilot AI app for users who have a desktop version of Microsoft 365 suite apps installed on their system, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. According to BleepingComputer, the rollout will begin next month and is expected to be completed halfway through November, affecting all Windows PCs worldwide, except those in the European Economic Area (EEA).“Starting in October 2025, Microsoft will begin automatically installing the Microsoft 365 Copilot app on Windows devices that have Microsoft 365 desktop client apps,” the company said on the Microsoft 365 message center. “This app provides a centralized entry point for accessing Copilot experiences and AI-powered capabilities across Microsoft 365. This change simplifies access to Copilot and ensures users can easily discover and engage with productivity-enhancing features.”Unfortunately, it seems that most personal users will have no way of opting out of this feature. But if you’re a system administrator, you can opt your organization out of this by disabling the automatic installation of Microsoft 365 Copilot in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center.

This update is part of Redmond’s push for the wider adoption of its Copilot AI app. Just this July, the Microsoft Edge browser introduced a Copilot Mode that can interact with your open tabs and find information you’re looking for. Furthermore, Microsoft bundled Copilot with the Microsoft 365 subscription, resulting in a 43% price hike.And while this might be a welcome development for those who use AI tools, it will most likely be seen as an annoyance by those who don’t use Copilot or AI in general. After all, if you use AI apps and even subscribe to one, you likely already have it installed on your computer. But for those who aren’t interested, they will likely just see this as another piece of bloatware that Microsoft is forcing down their throats.The software giant is spending billions of dollars on AI investments, and it likely wants users to start paying for services to recoup some of the cash it spent. However, statistics say that the AI adoption rate isn’t going as planned, with large companies reducing their reliance on these tools. It has even gotten to the point that an economist warned of an AI bubble that will be worse than the dot-com crash of 2000 when it bursts.Unless you have an administrator who manages your Microsoft 365 subscription (which isn’t true for most personal users), it seems that the only way to avoid getting Microsoft 365 Copilot automatically installed on your computer is to not use Microsoft 365. Otherwise, you’ll just have to ignore it and add the app to the list of disabled apps in Windows’ Startup.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The most annoying part of Copilot in 365 is the stupid context menu that pops up every time you perform a basic function like copy/paste. The menu stays there and hovers over text you need to read and won't go away unless you press Escape. So every function or shortcut you perform now requires an extra key press to get the thing out of your way.

Would I be right to expect that using Outlook for it's calendar, will see me forced to have Copilot?
If it does, Outlook is going, soon.

This isn't a bad thing for Office. Copilot is great at creating Excel functions , for example,from plain text that you wouldn't know of unless you were a master or used them frequently, among other things.
It's not bloatware as, unlike Gemini on phones, it doesn't consume a vast amount of resources if not being used (Gemini Nano takes 1/3 of the Pixel 10 Pro's RAM, for example), and only uses a tiny amount of storage if not being used. Also pretty sure you can just right click and Uninstall it with another click like you can now, so at most it's an annoyance for those who don't use it.
For home users though there's no compelling reason to get 365 unless you want to since there are several comparable cloud storage providers for the price (Google One, Proton, etc), Google Docs and Sheets existing, as well as stand alone suites like Libre Office being quite capable and one time purchase Office licenses being available retail and for cheap on the Grey market, and clients like Thunderbird (and Proton Mail if you're a subscriber) having cross platform access like Outlook.
If you're a Mac user or college student though...could be a different story, but Copilot probably isn't a bad thing for them. It's also interesting to see how some articles are written as if it's a bad thing, while others, like XDA's, are if it's a good thing.

As a home user I don't use Microsofts office tools. Libre Office is more than adequate for my documentation/spreadsheet needs. I use LibreOffice Writer fairly often but haven't done a spreadsheet if over 10 years. I should easily be able to avoid Copilot.

That is actually good: it will force more people to use alternatives like Libre Office.
Every time Microsoft shoots itself in the foot is a good thing.

You don't know other people's circumstances.

Remains the question, who has full control over "my" PC, if I can even call it such. I use CoPilot from time to time but I dont like if things are forced on me like MS does, glad I also use Linux and Mac..I have optons.

Anyone wanna see if you can block this by preemptively setting a folder where it would install and blocking write access to it?

1) it adds another "toolbar" to the composer of the modern Outlook, eating up remaining space after it is so graciously thrown to the wind by the modern typographically engineered design
2) it appears when you start a totally blank mail and it even gives you something to start with :tearsofjoy:
