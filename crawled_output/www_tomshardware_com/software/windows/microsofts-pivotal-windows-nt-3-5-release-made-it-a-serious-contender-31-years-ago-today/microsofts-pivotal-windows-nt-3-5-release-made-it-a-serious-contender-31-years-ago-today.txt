The Windows 11 you use today is still identified as "Windows NT" in some ways, and that's because its lineage extends all the way back to the venerable Windows NT. Version 3.5 is widely considered the most pivotal release for the "New Technology" version of Windows, so today we cast a glance back at Windows' forebears, as it was 31 years ago today that Windows NT 3.5 released to the public.When Microsoft first announced NT, it wasn't aimed at the family PC. NT was built for the enterprise, where Novell NetWare ruled networking and UNIX workstations were the only type of workstation taken seriously by "serious" computing guys. Windows 3.1, the friendly GUI most people knew, was still fundamentally an MS-DOS front-end, and that means it was for baby computers used by baby users, at least in the minds of workstation guys.By contrast, Windows NT was designed as a clean-slate fully-32-bit operating system with a portable kernel, preemptive multitasking, and protected memory. Dave Cutler and his team — many of whom were veterans of DEC's VMS — engineered Windows NT with long-term ambitions that went far beyond Microsoft's popular consumer products.

Windows NT 3.5 still visually resembled Windows 3.1 to the point that you could hardly see any difference. (Image credit: Microsoft Corporation)The very first version, Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, was more of a proof of concept than a practical OS. Purportedly codenamed "NT OS/2" during development thanks to its roots in Microsoft's abortive partnership with IBM, it was notoriously heavy. Minimum specs called for an 80386 with 12MB of RAM to really breathe — at a time when 4MB of RAM was typical and 8MB was luxurious. It was secure, modern, and forward-thinking, but the word most reviewers used was "slow."Enter Windows NT 3.5, codenamed "Daytona." It didn't reinvent the OS, but it did the next best thing: it tuned, trimmed, and accelerated it. Microsoft re-engineered large swaths of the networking stack, making file and print sharing significantly faster. Performance optimizations lowered memory demands, and the system became legitimately credible as both a workstation OS and a server, purposes for which it was sold as separate products. Daytona was the release where NT stopped feeling like an experiment and started to feel like a real product.Besides performance, networking was the star upgrade. Networking was such a focus of Windows NT that many people have mistakenly thought "NT" stood for "Network Technology." NT 3.5 brought first-class TCP/IP support at a time when the internet was just starting to break into public consciousness. Microsoft bundled utilities like FTP and Telnet clients alongside its revamped TCP/IP stack, allowing NT machines to connect to this strange, rapidly growing "world wide web" with relative ease. Compared to NetWare or early UNIX boxes, NT suddenly looked less like a lumbering curiosity and more like a contender.

Microsoft offered NT 3.5 builds for MIPS CPUs, DEC's Alpha chips, and even later PowerPC processors, reflecting Cutler's obsession with portability. The kernel was designed around a hardware abstraction layer (HAL), an ambitious idea at the time, meaning that the same codebase could in theory run across architectures. In practice, x86 soon dominated on the strength of Intel's fabrication expertise, but in 1994 the idea of NT as a cross-platform OS wasn't just marketing fluff; it really shipped on those platforms.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The interface, however, remained old-school. NT 3.5 still looked like Windows 3.1, complete with the classic Program Manager and File Manager. That familiar façade made it easy to use for folks coming from 16-bit Windows, but it also likely slowed adoption among professional users. Windows NT 3.51, launched just nine months after the original 3.5 release, made it much easier to write Windows 95 apps that could also run on NT by adding support for things like the Common Controls library.
Later, Windows NT 4 brought the Windows 95 user interface to the 32-bit NT. (Image credit: Dave Plummer)NT wasn't about looks, though—it was about laying the groundwork. By the time NT 4.0 arrived in 1996 with the Windows 95 shell grafted on top, the direction was clear. NT had won Microsoft's internal civil war against DOS-based Windows. Windows 2000 proved that an NT-based system could serve both workstation and consumer use cases, and this culminated in 2001's Windows XP, which unified consumer and enterprise under one NT codebase.In hindsight, Windows NT 3.5 was a transitional release. It was the moment the "New Technology" started proving its worth. It wasn't flashy, but it mattered, because without Daytona, there's no XP, no Windows 7, no Windows 11 — just a world where Microsoft never quite shook off DOS, and where we'd all probably be using Macs.For an operating system that most people never installed, that's quite the legacy.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Compared to VMS it was a disaster user unfriendly OS even versions after initial. All drivers for almost anything were missing and there were no one to ask for help. Only people who did not install it themselves can write any positive words about it.

Funny part was that in the same year came Linux showing that a total novice in the field can write his own OS and it will be more stable than MS had 10 years before and 10 years after that

Ah reminds me of NT 4 and how that was everywhere. Lot's of organizations would use 95/98 on the desktops with NT 4 domain and exchange server.

It is estimated that the number of OSes written so far to be in the hundreds, encompassing a vast range of systems from early mainframe and minicomputer platforms to desktop, mobile, and embedded systems.

Linux evolved into being very successful.
Windows, in all its variants, evolved into being very successful.
Many other OS's, both user oriented and business oriented, fell by the wayside.

Success, successful. During 1.5 decades the most successful OS was crappiest and most unstable MS DOS. And the most used so far are the ones we even don't know - embedded, installed by billions. Returning to our sheep, try to install NT 3.5 and you will remember this saying about mosquito and wolf
