Microsoft began rolling out its new Gaming Copilot assistant to Windows users as part of a public beta on September 19, following a previous rollout to Xbox Insiders in August. The feature, located within the Xbox Game Bar overlay, provides players with real-time in-game support using AI-driven context from their screen and Xbox account.Unlike past versions of Copilot integrated into Windows or Microsoft 365, Gaming Copilot is built with screen context and real-time game awareness. It reads from your Xbox account history, sees what you’re playing, and can analyze screen content on demand to answer in-game questions. Microsoft says it’s designed to help players find achievements, plan builds, and navigate quests without needing to alt-tab to wikis or YouTube.On paper, Gaming Copilot resembles third-party tools like Overwolf, but it operates at the system level within the Game Bar overlay, which provides more reliable full-screen behavior and compatibility with DirectX titles. Microsoft has also confirmed that the assistant can be pinned as a widget and activated with push-to-talk voice controls, two features already present in this early beta.

The company has not disclosed whether any of the Copilot inference runs locally or if it’s entirely cloud-based. There is also no mention of NPU acceleration, which would matter for players using Snapdragon X laptops or hybrid-core CPUs with on-device AI blocks. This will be a key testing point, particularly as Microsoft has framed the Copilot experience as optimized for new handhelds like the ROG Ally X.Anti-cheat compatibility is another open question. Vendors like Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye generally whitelist Game Bar itself, but Copilot is a more complex overlay, and Microsoft hasn’t clarified whether any specific protections are in place. With real-time screenshot analysis and persistent widgets, it’s not clear how Copilot will behave in titles with aggressive DRM or competitive match enforcement.With the release of Gaming Copilot, Microsoft appears to be making a concerted effort to make Windows feel more like a native gaming platform. Just days before the Copilot rollout, the company updated the Xbox app to serve as a unified launcher that aggregates titles from Steam, Epic, GOG, and others. Together, these changes transform Windows from a passive host OS to an active participant in the gaming experience.Gaming Copilot is now available for players aged 18 and older, in all regions except mainland China.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

While it'd be nice for things like walkthroughs of achievements and the like, better than splitscreening or using another device or monitor to watch a video or read a perhaps unconcise walkthrough, I'm not sure how welcome it will be for most people, especially if it pulls data from some random site or questionable Youtube source vs GameFAQs and someone's preferred reputable Youtube source.

If this is as useful as ChatGPT, it's going to be a big flop.
"Oh, you're right! It doesn't work that way."
"The hard reality is, what you're trying to do isn't possible." (it is)

It'll be OK, as long as it can be disabled...
