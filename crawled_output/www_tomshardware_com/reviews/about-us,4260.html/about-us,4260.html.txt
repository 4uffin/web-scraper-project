Our MissionTom's Hardware is the leading destination for tech enthusiasts of all skill levels. Whether you're building a PC, buying a laptop or learning how to create robots with your kids, we've got comprehensive editorial resources and a vibrant expert community to help you on your journey.Tom's Hardware TeamOur TeamPaul AlcornSocial Links NavigationEditor-in-ChiefAs a teenager, Paul scraped up enough money to buy a 486-powered PC with a turbo button (yes, a turbo button). Back when floppies were still popular he was already chasing after the fastest spinners for his personal computer, which led him down the long and winding storage road, covering enterprise storage. His current focus is on consumer processors, though he still keeps a close eye on the latest storage news. In his spare time, you’ll find Paul hanging out with his kids or indulging his love of the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals.Read the latest stories from Paul AlcornMatt SaffordSocial Links NavigationManaging EditorMatt began piling up computer experience as a child with his Mattel Aquarius. He built his first PC in the late 1990s and tried his hand at some mild PC modding in the early 2000s. He’s spent 18 years covering emerging technology for Smithsonian, Popular Science, and Consumer Reports, while testing components and PCs for Computer Shopper, PCMag, and Digital Trends. When not writing about tech, he’s often walking — through the streets of New York, over the sheep-dotted hills of Scotland, or just at his treadmill desk at home in front of the 50-inch 4K TV that serves as his PC monitor.Read the latest stories from Matt SaffordAnj BryantSocial Links NavigationAssistant Managing EditorAnj provides content layout and development support, and coordinates editorial initiatives for the talented group of authors and editors at Tom's Hardware. She enjoys putting her love for technology and her past IT experience to good use. With a background in Enterprise software that started with Cybermedia she eventually caught the hardware bug and hasn't looked back. Outside of Tom's, she's mom to two tech-savvy girls who keep her busy with questions about Minecraft modding.Read the latest stories from Anj BryantAndrew E. FreedmanSocial Links NavigationSenior EditorAndrew oversees laptop and desktop coverage and keeps up with the latest news in tech and gaming. His work has been published in Kotaku, PCMag, Complex, Tom’s Guide and Laptop Mag, among others. He fondly remembers his first computer: a Gateway that still lives in a spare room in his parents' home, albeit without an internet connection. When he’s not writing about tech, you can find him playing video games, checking social media, and waiting for the next Marvel movie.Read the latest stories from Andrew E. FreedmanJeffrey KampmanSocial Links NavigationSenior Analyst, GraphicsJeff Kampman has been building his own PCs since the mid-aughts and has been a professional PC hardware obsessive for over 10 years in both media and industry roles. He's especially focused on GPU performance and the ways that PC components work together to deliver the best gaming experience, but he can tell you all you need to know about almost any component that goes into or plugs into a PC. As Tom's Hardware's graphics guy, Jeff covers everything from integrated graphics processors to discrete graphics cards to the hyperscale GPU installations powering our AI future.Read the latest stories from Jeffrey KampmanBrandon HillSocial Links NavigationSenior EditorBrandon has been tinkering with PCs since childhood and received his first "real" PC, an IBM Aptiva 310, in the mid-1990s. He next went on to build his first custom PC with an Intel Celeron 300A processor overclocked to 450MHz on an Abit BH6 motherboard. Brandon has written about PC and Mac tech since the late 1990s, first at AnandTech before moving to DailyTech and later to Hot Hardware. When Brandon is not consuming copious amounts of tech news, he can be found enjoying the NC mountains or the beach with his wife and two sons.Read the latest stories from Brandon HillSarah Jacobsson PurewalSocial Links NavigationSenior EditorSarah is a hardware enthusiast and geeky dilettante who has been building computers since she discovered it was easier to move them across the world — she grew up in Tokyo — if they were in pieces. She's best-known for trying to justify ridiculous multi-monitor setups, dramatically lowering the temperature of her entire apartment to cool overheating components, typing just to hear the sound of her keyboard, and playing video games all day "for work." She's written about everything from tech to fitness to sex and relationships, and you can find more of her work in PCWorld, Macworld, TechHive, CNET, Gizmodo, Tom's Guide, PC Gamer, Men's Health, Men's Fitness, SHAPE, Cosmopolitan, and just about everywhere else. In addition to hardware, she also loves working out, public libraries, marine biology, word games, and salads. Her favorite Star Wars character is a toss-up between the Sarlacc and Jabba the Hutt.Read the latest stories from Sarah Jacobsson PurewalStephen WarwickSocial Links NavigationNews EditorStephen is Tom's Hardware's News Editor with almost a decade of industry experience covering technology, having worked at TechRadar, iMore, and even Apple over the years. He has covered the world of consumer tech from nearly every angle, including supply chain rumors, patents, and litigation, and more. When he's not at work, he loves reading about history and playing video games.Read the latest stories from Stephen WarwickSayem AhmedSocial Links NavigationSubscription EditorSayem's first foray into building PCs dates back to the 90s, where he helped his dad run a small PC business from their garage. After getting tired of installing Windows using a stack of floppy disks, he eventually became obsessed with disassembling video game consoles, without his parents' permission. His love for gaming led him to build his first gaming PC, using an Intel Core i5-2500K that spent most of its life overclocked, alongside a hand-me-down GeForce 9800 GTX. Since then, he's worked as a professional tech journalist since 2015, writing for Gamespot, IGN, and Dexerto. When Sayem isn't focused on the latest tech, he can usually be found playing his guitar or reading old fantasy novels.Read the latest stories from Sayem AhmedLes PounderSocial Links NavigationAssociate EditorLes Pounder is a creative technologist and for seven years has created projects to educate and inspire minds both young and old. He has worked with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to write and deliver their teacher training programme "Picademy".Read the latest stories from Les PounderStewart BendleSocial Links NavigationDeals WriterStewart has loved PCs since he was a child,
dabbling with BASIC on a ZX Spectrum 48K and still gets far too excited about building and playing on PCs now. He loves to tune and overclock his computers to smooth and stable clocks and run his favorite games and applications on the best settings without compromising quality and framerates. A firm believer in “Bang for the buck” Stewart likes to research the best prices and find the best coupon codes on computers, peripherals and components. Stewart also needs a spare room to house all his old PC parts and peripherals and maybe needs an intervention to stop him from buying more headphones, mice, and keyboards.Read the latest stories from Stewart BendleTom's Hardware ContributorsOur ContributorsAnton Shilov, Contributing Writer (News)Mark Tyson, Contributing Writer (News)Zhiye Liu, Contributing Writer (News & RAM)Aaron Klotz, Contributing Writer (News)Ash Hill, Contributing Writer (News)Sunny Grimm, Contributing Writer (News)Jowi Morales, Contributing Writer (News)Kunal Khullar, Contributing Writer (News)Hassam Nasir, Contributing Writer (News)Christian Eberle, Contributing Writer (Monitors)Joe Shields, Contributing Writer (Motherboards)Denise Bertacchi, Contributing Writer (3D Printers, Laser Cutter & Engravers)Shane Downing, Contributing Writer (Storage)E.

Back in these early days, the site was still called “Tom’s Hardware and Performance Guide” and its domain was sysdoc.pair.com — pair.com being a Pittsburgh-based hosting company.One of Tom’s Hardware’s journalistic milestones was Tom’s findings regarding the Intel Pentium III 1.13 GHz processor, which forced the chip company to postpone its launch by months. Since then, Tom’s Hardware has kept up the tradition with unrivaled scrutiny of technology.The current domain, tomshardware.com, was added on September 11, 1997, followed by additional language versions, including the French, German and Italian sites, all of which are run by independent teams. Pabst moved on to other pursuits in 2008, Tom's Hardware and sister site, Tom's Guide, became part of the Purch company in 2013 and Purch was purchased by Future Plc in 2018.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Today's Tom's Hardware is more than just a site for PC builders.
