More content creators are getting their hands on GPD's incredibly potent Win 5 handheld gaming PC, sporting AMD's flagship Strix Halo APU. YouTube hardware tester The Phawx has turned in his initial impressions of the handheld, particularly against competing AMD handhelds with more "conventional" hardware. He found the GPD Win 5 is up to twice as fast as competing Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handhelds while consuming the same amount of power (at 25W to 35W TDP).The Phawx provided a limited benchmark comparison between the flagship Ryzen AI Max 395+-powered GPD Win 5 and a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered handheld system. In these comparisons, the GPD Win 5 shows an astonishing amount of performance headroom thanks to the RTX 4060-class GPU on the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 SoC.In Returnal, the GPD Win 5 ran at nearly twice the framerate as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 handheld The Phawx was using for these tests with both systems running at the same 25-watt power limit. The GPD Win 5 produced about 80 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld ran at around 45 FPS.

In Doom: The Dark Ages; the GPD Win 5 ran at 56 FPS, and the HX 370-powered handheld turned out 31 FPS. The cherry on top is that the GPD Win 5 was running at higher graphical fidelity using FSR Quality upscaling instead of FSR Balanced on the HX 370 handheld.Furthermore, the Strix Halo 395+ offers even greater performance margins at higher power limits, thanks to its impressive specifications. According to these tests, the GPD Win 5's implementation of the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 only starts hitting diminishing performance returns at 40 watts or greater. By contrast, HX 370-handhelds start producing diminishing performance returns at 18 watts or greater.In God of War: Ragnarok, The Phawx reports that the GPD Win 5 runs at around 85 FPS at 25 watts, and the HX 370-powered handheld 67 FPS at the same power limit. However, bumping up the power limit to 70 watts on the GPD Win 5 produces a colossal jump all the way up to 176 FPS.The only caveat with the GPD Win 5's monstrous APU is that it doesn't behave well at ultra-low power limits. Below 25 watts, the Win 5's Strix Halo APU reportedly produces performance results that are barely any better than the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370. This performance behavior also extends to CPU-bound titles, since both CPUs take advantage of the same Zen 5 CPU architecture.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Still, these initial tests demonstrate the sheer power Strix Halo can offer when squeezed inside of a handheld gaming PC. Strix Halo wasn't designed to be a handheld gaming chip; it's more commonly seen in laptops and mini-PCs. Its massive 442mm² die sports 16 Zen 5 CPU cores and an RDNA 3.5 GPU with as many compute units as a PS5 (40 CUs in all). Somehow, GPD was able to figure out a way to fit this monstrous chip inside of its Win 5 handheld without sacrificing comfort or usability.Once it hits the market, the GPD Win 5 will likely be the world's first handheld to be powered by Strix Halo, and will almost certainly be the fastest handheld in the world as a result. The device will come in three trims: a baseline model sporting the Ryzen AI Max 385 with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, a mid-range option with the same storage and memory but with the flagship Ryzen AI Max+ 395, and there's a top-of-the-line model with the 395 chip, 64GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Z2X and HX370 are priced too high for the performance they offer.
Especially when you consider how little the improvement is over Z1X and 7840U.

This is finally the iGPU we all dreamed of when AMD bought ATI. This was 19 years in the making.
However, the pricing!!!!!!!!! People were hoping it would at least be equivalent to laptops with an AMD processor and discrete 4060. The pricing is just way too high. If AMD can get the pricing down to equivalent levels, then they'll have a winner on their hands.
It's a chiplet design, the SOC is bigger than the 4060 die but it's also housing the I/O die components:

Strix Halo is big and more expensive to use than other APUs, but if push comes to shove, they can probably shave off $300 from every price tag. Those 8-core chiplets add to the total die area, but do not cost much at all. It's supply/demand, not complexity, driving the cost.
Gaming-oriented products don't need 128 GB of LPDDR5X. 32-48 GB should be fine.
If the AI bubble bursts, we could see a quick pivot to gaming. That's the advantage of a dual-use product.
I think the leak diagram you're quoting is ancient. Zen 5 CCD = 70.6 mm^2, a small reduction from Zen 4. But I guess Strix Halo uses a slightly different version with die-to-die interconnects.

I'm really liking that 256-bit memory bus. It's regular DDR and not GDDR but that larger width helps give the GPU the bandwidth it needs.

The biggest problem with using Strix Halo for a handheld (if we ignore price) is that at low power it starts to throttle the memory in addition to CPU/GPU. I'd be really curious to see how the single CCD 385 handles the same situation as it will of course throttle but not having to deal with the second CCD might give it more power leeway.
It would also be interesting to know if infinity cache could bridge the gap on the 16CU parts. It's very obvious they're bandwidth limited since the improvement from Z1E to Z2E is nowhere near the one third increase in CU.

The performance is not surprising, but as a handheld drawing upwards of 30W, I think the practicality is low. Even with a beefy battery, one is unlikely to run it for close to 2 hours. The idea is great, but not very practical.

Most planes and trains, as well as waiting rooms and cars have power outlets. The battery is detachable because it's more reasonable to power this from a battery bank or a wall outlet. The cord they give you have thumb screws to hold it in place.

love how versatile and flexibility the handheld gaming PC market is right now, especially with giving us powerful apu options but price needs to come down. I also really hope v2 or v3 of Strix Halo can eek out at least 50-60% more performance at 10-15w than current max+ 395 levels and OEMs can include 90-99wh batteries with silicon carbon tech (or even sodium ion which seems to just be catching on in EVs). having true laptop rtx 4070 or 5060-level power at 15w with a 90wh battery would be a game changer.
