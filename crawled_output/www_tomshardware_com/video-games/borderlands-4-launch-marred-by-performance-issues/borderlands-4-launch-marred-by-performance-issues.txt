Performance complaints have dominated Borderland 4’s PC launch, but with a hefty day-one patch and DLSS in play, the story is more complicated than it might appear.

Borderlands 4 has arrived on PC to a chorus of criticism over performance and stuttering. Just one day after launch, Steam user reviews show as ‘Mixed’ as early reports from players described low frame rates and frequent crashes, even on high-end hardware.“Terrible optimization. Another Unreal Engine 5 casualty. Not worth buying in its current state unless you have a NASA PC,” wrote Steam user 'Rej'. Meanwhile, on X, a player claimed that their RTX 5090 couldn’t maintain 60 FPS, even with settings turned down, and other anecdotal reports have echoed complaints of stutter, texture pop-in, and unresponsive controls.Borderlands 4 cant reach 60 FPS on a freaking RTX 5090 with *THAT* graphics !!! The more I see these type of PC ports, the PC Gaming content creator in me dies bit by bit ! pic.twitter.com/LQT7FeFY2RSeptember 12, 2025Independent benchmarks back up those anecdotes. DSOGaming’s test on a Ryzen 9 7950X3D paired with an RTX 5090 saw frame rates dip to 40-43 FPS at 4K/Badass settings indoors. Enabling DLSS 4 in Quality mode brought the average closer to 60 FPS, but outdoor traversal still produced noticeable stutter.

Criticism has been especially sharp during shootouts, particle-heavy areas, and certain indoor sequences where performance has tanked without warning. Despite this, the game reached a peak of just under 208,000 concurrent players on launch day.Day-one patch improves stabilityBorderlands 4 officially launched at 12 PM ET for PC players on September 11, with Gearbox deploying a 2.7 GB day-one patch at the same time. But because many players had preloaded the game and jumped in the instant it unlocked on Steam, the update didn’t apply automatically. Those players effectively ran the unpatched build, leading to a wave of negative reviews.In a pre-patch breakdown by PC Gamer, Nick Evanson tested both minimum-spec and top-tier builds. His RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 9800X3D rig saw around 43 FPS in 4K with “badass” settings and no upscaling. “As you can see, the overall performance isn't great. Hitting 40 fps on average in an indoor environment… is really disappointing,” he wrote, later adding that, “Not long after Borderlands 4 launched on Steam, a 2.7 GB patch appeared…. I can say it stopped most of the crash-to-desktop failures I experienced with my first few runs."Even so, Evanson noted that outdoor sequences remained harder to stabilize than indoor ones. Large open areas with lots of AI and particle effects saw higher CPU utilization and sporadic hitching, reinforcing concerns that Unreal Engine 5’s heavy reliance on CPU-driven systems like Lumen and Nanite is part of the bottleneck.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.While the majority of the game’s early reviews were negative, recent reviews paint the game in a more positive light. “The game runs smooth [sic] at 80fps… my rig is RTX 4070 Ti Super and a 13th Gen i9 CPU,” wrote Steam user 'sudobored'.Pitchford: Don’t expect miracles on older PCsGearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been upfront about the challenges that some players might face. In a pre-launch post, he warned that systems below spec — especially those with older GPUs or without SSDs — might see serious issues. The day-one patch “does a lot,” Pitchford said, adding that the expectations of those using a below min-spec machine “should be that the game is unplayable.”In terms of the specs required, the game’s minimum specs, which can “run Borderlands 4 with solid performance on older pc hardware,” and maximum specs, which will “provide the intended experience,” are:Swipe to scroll horizontallyRow 0 - Cell 0 MinimumRecommendedProcessorIntel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700XIntel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800XGPUNVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580Memory16 GB RAM32 GB RAMStorage100 GB available space100 GB available spaceFor those still struggling, Gearbox has posted basic troubleshooting guidance, including driver updates and shader cache resets. The company has also posted an Nvidia optimization guide on Steam, the response to which has been pretty emphatic. Steam user ‘PeePeePantsCity’ sums up the mood nicely: “No one on PC wants to play at ~60 fps. They didn’t buy 3080s or 4080s to play games at 60 fps 1440p.”Tom’s Hardware has reached out to 2K Games for comment.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

A free tip: dont run it at 4k. Set fhd in settings and enjoy the game instead moaning that it slow downs to 60 fps. Anything above 40 fps is smooth like will smith in MiB part one, and your eye wont even notice. I guess that 99% of 200k concurrent players enjoy the game, while power users complain "oh but my rtx". Maybe the reason it crashes is in this insanely dumb run to 4k using 2000W PSUs.

Devs are so lazy nowadays it seems, ship the game and worry about issues later is their motto.

All games are now built with AI assist, both on design, coding and running of the games. Even the graphics are AI assisted, because the artists can't opimize the glyphs anymore for optimal performance. So everything is just done with the bare minimum and then let go for the AI / computers to handle it.
No more Elite kind of games where everything was optimized to the hilt.

Gamers are having Unreal engine fatigue with all this beta testing at a premium!

I don't buy any game until it's been out for a while (and on sale). I truly don't understand why people are willing to be unpaid beta testers.

Modern gaming died long time ago...
Don't be stupid to pay 3000$ on a graphic card to play AT full hd.
I'am now replaying old games at 4k with the GTX 980.

I can confirm the game is a brute to run. On 7950x3d, 8tb wd sn850x nvme drive and a 4090 I can't run native 4k max. I can max the game out at 4k DLSS quality with frame gen on and I hit 100-144 where my frame cap kicks in. So far with a few hours in on a 3 payer coop playthrough the game is 'mostly' smooth so far but I should be able to max a game like this out using DLAA without the need to hobble it with DLSS quality AND frame gen at the same time. I could see the use for one or the other to hit my target fps but needing both is a testament to how lazy game devs have become with upscaling tech being ubiquitous.

Yet another POS UE5 game. HARD pass.
If its UE5, I'm not interested in your game..

Gerabox just another 2nd rate company releasing a broken product and you sheep buy it, so no sympathy from me, if it runs and looks rubbish. Stop buying trash and the gaming industry may change, at the moment they get their cake and eat your slice too, smucks !
