It is notoriously easy to own more games than you have time to play on Steam. However, a Steam gamer in China has taken this phenomenon to the extreme. On Tuesday, SonixLegend became the first person to gain a Steam ‚ÄòGame Collector‚Äô badge for owning 40,000 games. Obviously still on the lookout for their next favorite title, the needle has moved up to 40,031 at the time of writing, according to SteamDB (h/t Polygon).
(Image credit: Future)SonixLegend‚Äôs achievement hasn‚Äôt happened overnight. This particular user has been building up their game collection on Steam for over 15 years.Imagine all the payments processing, code copying and pasting, and agreeing to T&Cs time that would be required to hoard 40,000 Steam games. If SonixLegend could go through these steps in a swift minute per game, they would need a full month (with no rest) to add 40,000 games to a library. If ‚Äòworking‚Äô 8-hour days on this endeavor, you‚Äôd be looking at three solid months of your life taken up to build this library.

As for actually playing through that enormous collection, Polygon estimates that it would take SonixLegend ‚Äúseven years of non-stop playtime‚Äù to work through and get value out of this enormous game collection. Again, at a more ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô 8 hours per day, you‚Äôd have to triple that timescale. Underlining the fact that SonixLegend is a ‚Äònormal‚Äô gamer, though (not a bot or some such), are stats that show they are really keen on some of the games in their collection. Alien Swarm (released 2010) has been played through for over 550 hours. Moreover, 35 other titles have been completed ‚Äòperfectly.‚ÄôTwo other SonixLegend stats stand out, which must make them a certified Steam-nut. First, we must highlight the potential cost of building this collection. According to SteamDB, the huge digital collection is worth nearly $640,000 at today‚Äôs prices, but SonixLegend must follow the sales, as they seem to have spent ‚Äòjust‚Äô $248,810 on these digital goodies. Secondly, this Steam Devotee ‚Äútechnically owns over 97,000 titles in their account,‚Äù notes Polygon, but apparently Valve doesn‚Äôt count its PC games store's ‚Äòshovelware.‚ÄôDespite the humongous state of their collection, we are sure SonixLegend is still looking forward to the next Steam Sale‚Ä¶
(Image credit: Future)Almost as surprising as SonixLegend‚Äôs dubious achievement is that there is another user hot on their heels. In second place in this leaderboard, Ian Brandon Anderson owned 39,502 Steam games. In third, we see ikun with 36,660 titles, and all members of the top-10 club have at least 33,000 games in their burgeoning libraries. Even to crack the top 100 of this leaderboard, you will need at least 19,000 games, at the time of writing.Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.My Steam PC collection expands to 135 games, which I thought was a lot.

So his user name is "SonixLegend" ; I am guessing they are also a Sonic the Hedgehog fan, and well, a Sonic fan having the mindset to acquire 40k games does not surprise me.

People collect lots of things. I have over 2,400 games from GOG. (I bought most of their retro games over the years and plenty of the newer ones). I have several hundred on Steam too. GOG has no DRM so it is my go to source for modern games.

if you're that rich or patient enough to spend that much over that long amount of time, you can definitely buy a house

Wow, for the amount of money spent on Steam, you get a virtual badge... I wonder what is the point of the achievement.

Huh, 40,000 seems a bit low to me, I would have expected the biggest Steam collection to be a lot more than that. I'm over halfway to 1000, and I only buy Steam games every now and again.
