Apollo Computing stepped forward to reveal its “Proper next-gen Amiga” to the masses earlier this week. The German firm has unveiled the Apollo A6000, a comprehensive modern Amiga system featuring advanced technologies, including a “cutting-edge V4 AC68080” FPGA, which makes it the “most powerful Amiga 68k compatible ever created.”Moreover, the Apollo A6000 retains the cutesy retro styling of the Amiga A600 (probably that machine’s best feature), enhanced by eye-popping tech specs and a built-in mechanical keyboard.

Vintage Amigans may best remember Apollo for its Amiga A1200 trapdoor accelerators, and more recently for Vampire FPGA accelerator boards for a host of legacy Commodore machines. While building up its expertise in the vintage-to-modern FPGA technology arena over the last decade, it appears to have finally reached the milestone of this fully remastered machine, which dovetails with the 40th anniversary of the Amiga.

So, what is the Apollo A6000? We’ll put together a specs table shortly, but the highlights include the aforementioned AC68080 FPGA, the provision of an unheard-of amount of Amiga system RAM (fast RAM and Chip RAM), CF plus dual SD slot storage, the SAGA chipset, and ample modern connectivity and peripheral ports.
More than 404x faster than the A600, which shares a similar style and form factor (Image credit: Apollo Computing)Special attention should be paid to the AC68080 FPGA, which Apollo says they spent 10 years creating. A combination of reverse engineering the Amiga chipset and the Motorola 68000 series of CPUs has led to the development of this processor. There’s actually a website dedicated to it here if you want a super-deep dive on the ‘Apollo Core.’ At that link, you will be able to dig through the details of the features of the fast and fully featured ‘AMMX’ enhanced FPGA.Swipe to scroll horizontallyApollo A6000 specsProcessorV4 AC68080 FPGAChipsetSAGARAM2GB fast RAM, 12MB chip RAMStorage128GB CF card and dual SD card slotsPorts and interfacesHDMI, 5x USB (one for power), Maggie 3D-VFX RTG graphics, Ethernet, mouse, joystick, IDE HDD, stereo audio with optional analog out, JTAG, expansion bayKeyboardMechanical keyboard with ABS caps and Cherry MX switchesSoftware68K Apollo OS installed, which “runs Amiga OS 3.x software, games, Atari and MacOS” titlesCase3D printed FDM case with choice of colors

Unfortunately, we have some bad news to share regarding the Apollo A6000’s pricing and availability. With all those nice custom-made technologies coming together in the A6000, it is priced at over $1,000. In its home country, Apollo sold 40 First Edition Codename Unicorn devices for €960 each within hours of the announcement. Converted directly, that’s $1,128, but you could deduct 19% German VAT and add locally applicable U.S. sales tax to get a better idea of the final actual pricing.The lucky buyers of this first production run of 40 units can look forward to delivery shortly. However, those of us who missed that first run should stay tuned to the links above for news of the next batch(es). On its Discord server, Apollo says details of the subsequent production runs and options will go live on the coming Friday (September 26).Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom's Hardware NewsletterGet Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: Apollo Computing)(Image credit: Apollo Computing)You wait 30+ years for a new Amiga...Amiga hardware fans with smaller budgets can also look forward to the A1200 from Retro Games.

It's impressive what they've done breathing life into the original hardware used by the Amiga and its great to see a modernised 68K CPU and not just another ARM-RISC core but the costs of using an FPGA is very high.

Trying to find out how fast the CPU is. I followed the link to the dedicated website. They mention that it's now 64-bit and a performance figure of 600 MIPS. I also found this discussion thread, which seems to indicate that the 68080 runs at 100 MHz:

TBH, 100 MHz is a bit lower than I was expecting, but you do take a pretty big performance penalty when using FPGA instead of ASIC.

Ended with an '040 A3000 and A1200, A4000. Every Amiga sans A1000 in between. Developers jumped ship after Commodore killed what was left of a fine PC. Commodore went on the cheap, scrapping 50 pin SCSI for (Barf!) IDE. Game over, hello PC.

On the technical side Amiga was pretty amazing for that era, unfortunately all those custom chips and protocols caused it to be very expensive and not compete well against IBM PC clones which all benefited from economies of scale. An ISA card is an ISA card, SIMM memory is SIMM memory, a frame buffer is a frame buffer, basically any manufacturer can build a compatible part for those computers, driving costs down.
I really liked the Amiga and was sad when it died out.

I'd had hoped for something a little more significant in the hardware but I am not exactly surprised either with the specs. I'll be interested to see what the new machine can do.

I think they also switched from DIMMs to SIMMs (the mainstream PC memory form factor, at the time). That happened in the G3, which I think was also one of their first few generations to feature PCI. Furthermore, it had a familiar mini-tower form factor and layout. I still remember popping off the side panel of one at work and remarking how it was basically a PC in every way except the CPU (which was PowerPC, back then).

1Ghz as an 68030 seems crazy fast. (for a "real" amiga)

Performance is application dependent:

TerryLaze said:http://www.apollo-core.com/index.htm?page=productsUp to 250Mhz as an 68080The page you quoted says it's as fast as a 250 MHz 060. It doesn't actually say what clock speed the 080 runs at.
I hadn't seen those particular speed comparisons, but it does seem to reinforce the idea that it's running somewhere in the ballpark of 100 MHz.
TerryLaze said:1Ghz as an 68030 seems crazy fast. (for a "real" amiga)Yeah, if you're only interested in using this for retro computing, I'm sure it'll be fine. If you want to run something like a modern web browser on it, a Raspberry Pi would run circles around it.
The main question I had was whether they were trying to put it forth as any sort of modern platform, but clearly not. That's fine.

Also the 080 is a fictional thing that they made so there is no comparison you can make, 100Mhz might be super fast.

TerryLaze said:Also the 080 is a fictional thing that they madeIt stopped being fictional after they made it. The full name is the "Apollo Core 68080". They're borrowing the numbering scheme and ISA from Motorola, of course.
TerryLaze said:so there is no comparison you can make, 100Mhz might be super fast.You can't compare it to a Motorola 080, because they never made one. However, their chip does have a clock speed and a I posted a link to where one of their employees compared it to CPUs with different ISAs.
