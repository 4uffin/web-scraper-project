Though it's not a big printer, it has plenty of real estate for medium-scale prints without needing to rearrange your whole workshop.Based on Prusa’s open-source i3, it features a few extra touches added by Sovol. It has a high-flow hotend, built-in camera for monitoring prints, and, of course, the vanilla Klipper for speed and precision.The Sovol SV06 ACE is a 3D printer boasting impressive features, including 600mm/s top speeds, automatic bed leveling, dual Z-axis motors, vibration reduction, and a direct-drive extruder capable of printing at temperatures up to 300°C.With 3D printers getting more complex, it’s refreshing to find one that keeps it simple. During testing, I printed numerous dragons and experimented with highly detailed jewelry boxes and textured bowls, which came out clean and sharp-looking.More: Sovol SV06 ACE ReviewBest Budget 3D Printer for Beginners

It's an ideal beginner-friendly machine that is packed with deluxe features and retails at an affordable $199.The Ender 3 V3 SE is easy to use as it comes almost fully assembled and only took us 15 minutes to build before we were ready to get printing. Creality includes a printed manual to guide you through the building process as well as installing or changing filaments. Video instructions are also available online for your convenience.With a maximum speed of 250mm/s, the V3 SE may not be among the fastest 3D printers around today, but it's faster than the Anycubic Kobra Neo (our previous best budget pick), which had a max speed of 60mm/s. Our tests turned out clean prints, some with tiny wisps like with the Domsculpts Chibi Totoro.It's also smaller than the Kobra Neo, so it takes up less space, but it has the same build volume (220 x 220 x 250 mm) and has a slightly bigger LED interface with knob controls. Sadly, it does not have a touch screen or WiFi support. It does have CR Touch for auto bed leveling and a Sprite direct drive, which are features reserved for Creality's premium models like the S1.Creality made significant improvements to the Ender 3 V3 Series with the SE model but kept the cost low to benefit budget-conscious makers - new and old.More: Creality Ender 3 V3 SE ReviewBest Budget 3D Printer for Multicolor Printing

It has a camera for AI print monitoring, an improved, leak free hotend and a beefier frame.It’s an “average” sized 3D printer, with a 255 x 255 x 260mm print volume, and a sweet $399 price tag that is $50 to $100 cheaper than the competition. The ACE Pro material handler is simple to use and easy to maintain. The Kobra 3 V2 uses a high flow hotend to produce excellent prints with an average speed of 200mm/s and input shaping to keep things crisp.Anycubic Slicer Next is the real game changer. Based on Orca Slicer, it’s an easy-to-use, Open Source program with all the features you’d expect from a brand leader. It allows you to color your own models or use models colored in Bambu Slicer. It also has tools to fine tune your purge volume so you can cut back on wasted filament.More: Anycubic Kobra 3 V2 ReviewBest Budget 3D Printer for Multicolor Printing Alternative

This tiny machine is capable of producing nearly flawless multi-color models in record time. It can print at a maximum speed of 500mm/s and go toe-to-toe with its big brothers without breaking a sweat, thanks to its excellent input shaping. This is why it lands a place in our 3D printer speed hierarchy as one of the fastest printers we've tested.The A1 Mini is also packed with the premium features from Bambu Lab that we've come to expect - from automatic bed leveling, flexible PEI coated build plate, easy to navigate smart menu and its all metal direct drive hotend that can reach up to 300 degrees. It comes almost fully assembled and makes it easy for new makers to put the rest together and start color printing right away. It's also a very quiet machine, so you can have a job running at odd hours or during a call and not even hear it working.It debuted for $299, which is just over half the price of a P1P. Even better, it is currently on sale for $199, which is a hundred dollars less than its MSRP.The Bambu Lab A1 Mini is your best bet if you are looking to dabble into color printing for the first time. The combo costs $399 (on sale for $349), and you can use up to four spools for printing. The A1 Mini is also compatible with other third-party filaments, so your options are limitless.More:

With an additional $15 discount, you can purchase it directly from Creality for $265.The KE is a step-up version of Ender V3 SE. Here are some of its notable features: open source platform provides flexibility, Wi-Fi connectivity for PC and mobile notifications and controls, has K1-based hot end capable of printing using a wide variety of filaments, supports high-speed printing with a maximum speed of 500mm/s and acceleration of 8000mm/s2.For the most part, our test prints came out smooth and clean. However, some prints, like the one for the Maker’s Muse Clearance Castle, needed some tuning to fix minor issues.If you have the budget or want an even faster machine with more premium features, consider upgrading to the Creality CR10 SE, currently on sale for $399.More: Creality Ender 3 V3 KE ReviewBest Budget Resin 3D Printer for Beginners

It also comes with its own custom slicer, the Photon Workshop V3. Priced at $209, this machine is a solid and affordable option if you are looking to get started with resin 3D printing.

(TIP: Use high-definition resin for even better results.) The Mars 5 Ultra includes a smart sensor to detect resin levels, a built-in camera to monitor your prints and check for failures, and a tilt release mechanism for quick and easy removal of prints when you are done. These features make it easy to use and a great option for makers who want to start getting into resin 3D printing.During our testing, we ran several test prints using different Elegoo resins (and one with Prusa’s Resin Model Color Kit), and each resulted in successful prints with clear and smooth details. We did encounter a "sticking" issue on our first test, but it was easily fixed by adjusting some settings. Check out our review for more details.The Elegoo Mars 5 Ultra is currently on sale for $269.99 at Elegoo. If you want something with a bigger build volume and don't mind a slightly slower machine, you can get the Anycubic Photon Mono X2 for a steal at $149.More: Elegoo Mars 5 Ultra ReviewBest Budget 3D Printer Shopping TipsHere are a few important points to consider when choosing the best budget 3D printer.✅ Cost? How much can you afford to spend? If your budget is really tight, you can grab a model that's less than $200 but a sub-$300 budget will get you farther.✅ FDM or Resin?The two main types of 3D printers are FDM, which involves spools of filament that are extruded onto the build plate or resin (aka SLA), which uses light to shape liquid resin. FDM printers are easier to use and don't have the safety concerns that come with handling noxious chemicals. If you can handle them properly, Resin printers give you a bit more detail, particularly for miniatures. Given the ease of use, though, we think FDM is best for most people. ✅ Features Look for auto bed leveling, easy setup, and a good UI. On FDM printers, getting a PEI build plate or direct drive design is a real plus. For resin, look for a high output resolution (2K, 4K or higher).

I have a photon mono 2; it was very cheap from microcenter over the holidays.
I haven't used it much because I've broken everything I've tried to remove from being stuck to the print surface, and you can't get a removable flexible print surface for it in the right size.
Is obsolete and must not have been popular, so there's not really any 3rd party support.
