Kennedy Jr.‘s health and human services, which historically has had nothing to do with offshore wind farms. The reasoning? A conspiracy theory that wind turbines emit electromagnetic fields that could harm human beings.Last week, we published Gabriella Burnham’s investigation into the controversy behind Vineyard Wind. She suggested that Nantucket’s debate over wind power represented a microcosm of its future in the US. With Trump’s aggressive moves against sustainable energy, Gabriella’s prediction is looking more and more correct.The future of wind energy might come down to one turbine bladeGabriella BurnhamAug 25NewsNewsTrump is moving Space Command to AlabamaEmma RothSep 2JExternal LinkComments0Justine CalmaAug 29Link“They burning the planet down.”It’s been 20 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated Jon Batiste’s hometown of New Orleans. We now know that climate change made warm ocean temperatures that fueled the storm more likely and increased its maximum sustained wind speed.“The weather patterns are shifting. Nobody wants that. And we know what the solution is. There’s an overwhelming majority of people that believe in clean energy,” Batiste says in an interview about his new song Petrichor.‘It’s a warning, set to a dance beat’: Jon Batiste on his new song urging climate action 20 years after Katrina[The Guardian]JExternal LinkComments0Justine CalmaAug 29LinkA former chemical industry lawyer is at the EPA now, trying to scrap a ‘forever chemical’ rule.“If they overturn this, it would leave the public responsible for cleaning up, not the companies that knowingly polluted the land,” University of California, San Francisco professor Tracey Woodruff tells The New York Times, which first reported on the proposal.An Industry Insider’s Changes at the E.P.A.

Not only is that misleading, it also takes the focus away from solutions that might actually address the leading causes of death — vessel strikes and entanglement with fishing gear.Whales are dying, but it’s not because of wind farmsJustine CalmaMay 11NewsNewsLooks like nuclear fusion is picking up steam Justine CalmaAug 26NewsNewsTrump told a major offshore wind project to stop construction just before it reached the finish lineJustine CalmaAug 25When the Blade BreaksHow the future of wind energy in the US might come down to NIMBYs and Nantucket.Gabriella BurnhamAug 25TExternal LinkComments0Thomas RickerAug 25LinkSolar panel prices plummet.Trump’s tariffs on solar panels — with 80-plus percent coming from China — are complicating the affordability equation in the US, but record low prices due to overproduction is good news for the rest of world bent on switching to clean energies.Solar panels’ price dropped to 8.7 cents per watt on July 2, the lowest level based on comparable data going back to 2011.Chinese solar makers' losses deepen as industry vows to end price war[Nikkei Asia]They’re trying to make deep-sea mining happen﻿The US is saying ‘to hell with the international mining code.’Justine CalmaAug 24NewsNewsWorkers need better protections from the heat Justine CalmaAug 22JExternal LinkComments0Jay PetersAug 21LinkIs Apple’s fitness chief a jerk?Apple says no, but a lawsuit accuses Jay Blahnik of creating a toxic work environment, reports The New York Times:When confronted with Mr. Blahnik’s behavior, Apple moved to protect him after an internal investigation.
