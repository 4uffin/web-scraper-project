Last week, we saw Apple TV’s The Studio and HBO Max’s The Penguin coming out as big winners during the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Tonight, the winners will be announced for major categories in the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony. Severance and The White Lotus lead the way in nominations, though The Penguin, The Last of Us, and Andor are also predicted to take home a bunch of statuettes. If you’re hoping to tune in, here’s how you can watch tonight’s awards ceremony live. When Are the Emmys?The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards officially start at 8pm ET / 5pm PT on Sunday, September 14. The red carpet begins at 6pm ET / 3pm PT, with pre-shows kicking off throughout the day. The event is scheduled for three hours, lasting until around 11pm ET (though it almost always runs a tad long). Where to Stream the Emmys Live Available Until Sept 1850% Off Paramount+ 9Get one year of Paramount+ Essential for $29.99 (normally $59.99) or Paramount+ Premium for $59.99 (normally $119.99)See it at Paramount+The 74th Emmy Awards Ceremony will air live on CBS while streaming on Paramount+ Premium. The full ceremony will be available to stream on-demand through any Paramount+ plan the following day. Presumably to align with the event, Paramount+ is offering 50% off the cost of its annual subscriptions. Until September 18, you can grab a year of Paramount+ Essential for $29.99 (normally $59.99), or Paramount+ Premium for $59.99 (normally $119.99). Otherwise, the service also happens to offer a seven-day free trial. However that trial is limited to new subscribers to the monthly plan, which doesn’t have any active discounts. For reference, ad-supported Paramount+ plans start at $7.99/month, while the ad-free plan starts at $12.99/month. Who's Hosting the Emmys This Year? This year’s awards ceremony will be hosted by stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze. It’s the comedian’s first time hosting the event, where his stand-up special, Your Friend, Nate Bargatze, has received two nominations. Like previous years, the ceremony will take place at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Who’s Nominated? This year’s awards are based on nominations for series that aired between June 1, 2024 and May 1, 2025. You can find the full schedule that led to this year’s nominees on the Emmys' website. Severance Season 2 Episodes 1-6 GalleryView 12 ImagesLeading the way in nominations this year is Season 2 of Severance and Season 3 of The White Lotus. We had great things to say about both of these, particularly the latest season of Severance, which Samantha Nelson described as “top-tier science fiction TV” in her review. I’m personally rooting for Cristin Milioti for her performance in The Penguin. For the full list, you can check out our breakdown of this year’s nominees.
