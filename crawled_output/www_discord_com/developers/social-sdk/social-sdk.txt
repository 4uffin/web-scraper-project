It is available for production for PC, with mobile (iOS and Android), as well as console support for PlayStation and Xbox available for experimental use. The Discord Social SDK does not formally support HTML5/Web or Linux platforms. Read more about platform support in our documentation.Can we use Discord Voice Chat without the full SDK integration?No. Discord Voice Chat is not available as a standalone service.Can I customize how my invites and rich presence look in Discord?Yes! The Social SDK provides a variety of configuration options to tailor how rich presence and invites show up to players within Discord. See the Setting Rich Presence and Managing Game Invites guides to see how it's done.What are the current rate limits for the Social SDK communication features?To learn more about the rate limits for the Social SDK communication features, please see our rate limits documentation.How do I remove rate limits for the Social SDK communication features?To learn how to remove the rate limits for the Social SDK communication features, please see our documentation on application requirements.Player ExperienceIf I implement this SDK, will players need a Discord account to play my game?Players will not be required to connect a Discord account to play your game. However, for players to take full advantage of the Discord Social SDK features, players will need to connect a Discord account. Non-Discord users will have more limited access.Will this integration affect my game performance?The Discord Social SDK is written in performant C++ to be as fast as possible. It offloads all work to a separate thread as the game, while loading and processing data that is relevant to minimize cost. Additionally, the voice engine is already in use within the Discord client, known for stability and quality. Are players required to use the in-game features that enable them to send/receive Discord messages and view their Discord friends from within a game?No, the social features that enable players to send/receive Discord messages and view their Discord friends from within a game are optional. Players will choose whether or not to connect their Discord account to enable them.If a player is messaging a friend on Discord, how can the friend on Discord know that theyâre receiving messages from within a game?When a player has sent a message from within a game, a controller icon will appear next to their name on Discord as a visual indicator.Security and PrivacyWho is responsible for moderation? If issues happen through a Discord DM that shows in-game, is it our job to moderate or Discord's?Developers are responsible for moderation of all messages or other content within their game. See Moderation with the Discord Social SDK for more information.What will Discord do with player messages from the game that appear in Discord?Messages sent from the game that appear on Discord are treated like any other message on Discord, consistent with Discord's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. You can also find more information here. If you have further questions, please reach out to Discord directly.Can we create provisional accounts programmatically without requiring user credentials or manual input?Yes, you will be able to create provisional accounts programmatically for every player, without the need for user credentials or manual input. These accounts are not visible to players and are replaced by linked accounts once the player connects their Discord account. This functionality is a core requirement of the SDK, as provisional accounts enable full SDK capabilities for both linked and unlinked players.What kind of user authentication is used?The Discord Social SDK operates under normal OAuth2 principles.Are provisional accounts full Discord accounts that players can interact with?Provisional accounts are accounts that can be used to access SDK features in a game, but they cannot be used to log into the Discord client. They allow a player to have access to in-game functionality powered by the SDK such as game invites, friends list, DMs, lobby chat, even if they don't have a Discord account or haven't linked their Discord account. However, because the player can't log into a provisional account using the Discord app, they cannot do the following:Receive DMs from players when they aren't playingRespond to messages when they aren't playingSee friends status when they aren't playingAccess a unified friends list between different gamesSTAY INFORMEDWant to keep up to date with all the latest news and updates DiscordÂ hasÂ for game developers?Sign Up for Our Newsletter
