Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet, i.e., websites.Basics of Web Development To better understand the foundation of web development, it is recommended to take a look at the concepts used in web development.Why Learn Web Development?Web Development PrerequisitesImportant Terminologies Do you wish to learn Web Development in a scheduled manner ?

Web Development Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, quizzes and practical projects.There are two major areas: Frontend and Backend which forms the backbone of web development each plays a crucial role in creating seamless, functional web experiences.Frontend DevelopmentIn this module, we explore the core technologies that run in the user’s browser—the client side—including how web pages are structured, styled, and made interactive, building everything users see and interact with.HTML (HyperText Markup Language): HTML is the language used to create the basic structure and content of web pages. It uses elements, tags, and attributes to organize text, images, and links.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the HTML content. It controls colors, fonts, layouts, and how the page looks on different devicesMore importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.JS (JavaScript): JavaScript adds life to web pages by making them interactive. It handles things like buttons, animations, and form checks.Backend Development:In this module, we will explore the technologies that work behind the scenes on the server to handle data, run the website, and store information.Server-Side Programming LanguagesIn Backend Development, Server-side programming languages are used to write code that runs on the server, not in the user’s browser. This server-side scripting handles tasks like processing data, managing databases, and controlling how the website works behind the scenesBelow are some popular languages used to build the back end of web applications:JavaScript/Node.js:JavaScript is a popular programming language mainly used to add interactivity on the client side (in browsers). With Node.js, JavaScript can also run on the server side. Node.js is an open-source environment that allows JavaScript to build fast, scalable back-end services like APIs. Many big companies like PayPal, Uber, and Netflix use Node.js for their server-side code.PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.Ruby: An object-oriented programming language designed to be simple and natural to use. Ruby helps developers write clean and readable code.Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available.Golang(Go): Golang is a procedural and statically typed programming language having the syntax similar to C programming language. Sometimes it is termed as Go Programming Language.C#: A modern, object-oriented language often used to build web applications on Microsoft platforms.DatabasesA database is where a website’s data like user's data, product's data are stored and organized. It is part of the backend (server side) that manages and keeps this information safe. Websites use databases to save and access information like user details, content, and transactions. Some databases organize data in tables (called relational databases, like MySQL), while others store data in flexible formats (called NoSQL databases, like MongoDB). There are basically two types of databases:1. SQL/Relational DatabaseA relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used in web applications.Postgre SQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for its reliability and extensibility.2. NoSQL DatabasesA NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases. Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications. Mongodb: MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for flexible, scalable applications.Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data.Redis: Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging.Note: We use Database management systems help keep the data safe, organized, and easy to use.APIs and Data Exchange FormatsDuring Website development, different software components and web applications constantly need to communicate and share information. For instance, the frontend of your web application (running in the user's browser) needs to get data from the backend (running on a server), or your application might need to fetch information from a third-party service like a weather provider or a payment gateway. This communication is made possible through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and standardized Data Formats.Data Exchange formate for API Communication: When applications communicate via APIs, they need a common, structured way to represent the data being exchanged. This is where data formats come in. Below are two common data formats used extensively in web development for API communication:JSON: JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a format for structuring data.XML: Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.Version Control and DeploymentDeveloping a web application involves more than just writing code. Two critical processes that ensure a smooth, organized, and reliable development workflow are Version Control and Deployment. Version control helps manage the evolution of your codebase, especially when working in teams, while deployment is the process of making your web application accessible to the world. Modern development practices tightly integrate these two concepts, often through automation.GraphicsGraphical elements are one of the key feature of any webpage. They can be used to convey important points better than text does and beautify the webpage.Canvas: The HTML “canvas” element is used to draw graphics via JavaScript.SVG: SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It basically defines vector-based graphics in XML format.Some Important Links on Web TechnologyHow can I start to learn Web Development?10 Best Web Development Project Ideas For Beginners [2025] History And Evolution of Web DevelopmentWeb 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 with their differenceTop Trends in Web DevelopmentTop 9 Technologies Transforming the Future of Web Development
