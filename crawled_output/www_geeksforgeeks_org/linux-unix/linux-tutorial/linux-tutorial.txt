Linux is one of the most widely used open-source operating systems. It's fast, secure, stable, and powers everything from smartphones and servers to cloud platforms and IoT devices. Linux is especially popular among developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals.Linux is:A Unix-like OS used in servers, cloud infrastructure, supercomputers, personal computers and embedded systems.Reliable and secure, making it ideal for web hosting, networking, and automation.Preferred in DevOps, where it's used for scripting, configuration, containerization (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines.Open-source and customizable, giving users full control over their systems and workflows.This Linux tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced professionals. It covers everything from basic commands and file management to advanced topics like file permissions and shell scripting. 1. Understanding Linux BasicsIn this section, we will cover the basics of Linux operating system, how it works, and how it's different from Unix. We'll learn about the concept of Linux distributions (distros), why they exist, and how to choose the right one based on your needs—whether you're a beginner, developer, or system admin.Introduction to Linux Operating SystemWhat are Linux Distribution?Choosing a Linux DistributionDifference between Linux/UnixInstalling LinuxBefore getting started with Linux, we need to set it up on your system. Here are two common ways to do this:Installing Linux Using a Virtual MachineCreating a Dual Boot System with Linux and Windows2. Linux CommandsLinux commands are instructions entered in the terminal to perform tasks such as navigating directories, managing files, monitoring system performance, and installing software. Here are the most commonly used Linux commands along with a complete list:25 Basic Linux Commands For Beginners Complete Linux Commands3. Linux File SystemThe Linux file system organizes data in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root ("/"). It defines how files and directories are stored, accessed, and managed, ensuring efficient system navigation and resource organization. In this section, we’ll explore its key components including the directory structure, file types, absolute and relative paths, and mount points.

File Management in LinuxFile management in Linux is all about creating, viewing, editing, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories using both the command line and graphical tools. In this section, we’ll cover essential file management commands like ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, and touch, along with concepts like file paths, wildcards, and hidden files. File Management in LinuxFiles Listing:
