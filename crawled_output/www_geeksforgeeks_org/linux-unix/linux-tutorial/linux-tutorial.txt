Linux is one of the most widely used open-source operating systems. It's fast, secure, stable, and powers everything from smartphones and servers to cloud platforms and IoT devices. Linux is especially popular among developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals.Linux is:A Unix-like OS used in servers, cloud infrastructure, supercomputers, personal computers and embedded systems.Reliable and secure, making it ideal for web hosting, networking, and automation.Preferred in DevOps, where it's used for scripting, configuration, containerization (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines.Open-source and customizable, giving users full control over their systems and workflows.This Linux tutorial is designed for both beginners and experienced professionals. It covers everything from basic commands and file management to advanced topics like file permissions and shell scripting. 1. Understanding Linux BasicsIn this section, we will cover the basics of Linux operating system, how it works, and how it's different from Unix. We'll learn about the concept of Linux distributions (distros), why they exist, and how to choose the right one based on your needs—whether you're a beginner, developer, or system admin.Introduction to Linux Operating SystemWhat are Linux Distribution?Choosing a Linux DistributionDifference between Linux/UnixInstalling LinuxBefore getting started with Linux, we need to set it up on your system. Here are two common ways to do this:Installing Linux Using a Virtual MachineCreating a Dual Boot System with Linux and Windows2. Linux CommandsLinux commands are instructions entered in the terminal to perform tasks such as navigating directories, managing files, monitoring system performance, and installing software. Here are the most commonly used Linux commands along with a complete list:25 Basic Linux Commands For Beginners Complete Linux Commands3. Linux File SystemThe Linux file system organizes data in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root ("/"). It defines how files and directories are stored, accessed, and managed, ensuring efficient system navigation and resource organization. In this section, we’ll explore its key components including the directory structure, file types, absolute and relative paths, and mount points. Linux File SystemLinux File Hierarchy StructureLinux Directory StructureFile System Navigation Commands in LinuxAbsolute and Relative Pathnames in UNIX4. File Management in LinuxFile management in Linux is all about creating, viewing, editing, moving, copying, and deleting files and directories using both the command line and graphical tools. In this section, we’ll cover essential file management commands like ls, cd, cp, mv, rm, and touch, along with concepts like file paths, wildcards, and hidden files. File Management in LinuxFiles Listing:

Shell ScriptingShell scripting is writing a series of commands in a script file to automate tasks in a Linux or Unix shell. It simplifies repetitive tasks like file management, system monitoring, and process automation, using languages like Bash or other shell environments:Introduction to Linux Shell and Shell ScriptingWhat is Kernel?What is Shell?Different Linux ShellsDifference between Shell and KernelWhat is a Terminal?Creating and Running Shell ScriptsCreating a Shell ScriptDefining the Shell Script Interpreter (#!/bin/bash)Comments in the Shell ScriptStoring and Displaying Messages in a Shell ScriptStoring the Output of CommandsExit Codes of Shell CommandsVariables in Shell ScriptingShell Scripting – Shell VariablesShell Scripting – Different Types of VariablesRules for Variable DefinitionBash ScriptingBash Scripting – Introduction to Bash and Bash ScriptingBash Script – Define Bash Variables and Its TypesWorking of Bash ScriptingHow To Run Bash Script In Linux?Bash Scripting - FunctionsDifference between Shell (sh) and BashBasic Operators in Shell ScriptingAdvanced Topics in Shell ScriptingMaking Your Own Linux Shell in C30+ Common Linux Shell Script Examples9. System AdministrationSystem administration in Linux involves managing and maintaining Linux systems, including tasks like user management, file permissions, software installation, network configuration, and monitoring system performance. It ensures the system operates efficiently and securely.What is Linux System Administration?Beginner's Guide to Linux System AdministrationBasic Linux Commands and File System NavigationUser Management in LinuxGroup Management in LinuxMonitoring and TroubleshootingHow to Monitor System Usage, Outages, and Troubleshoot Linux ServersLinux Systemd and Boot ProcessIntroduction to Systemd and its ComponentsBoot Process in LinuxHow to Control Systemd Services on a Remote Linux Server10.
