Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. Mainly used to manage data. Whether you want to create, delete, update or
read data, SQL provides commands to perform these operations. Widely supported across various database systems like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server and many others.Mainly works with Relational Databases (data is stored in the form of tables)Writing First SQL QueryBefore running SQL queries you need to set up a database server like MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite. Here, we are going to use MySQL server. Follow below steps to set up a basic SQL Environment:Install MySQL in your systemStart MySQL ServerAccess MySQL Command LineAfter your MySQL environment is set up, you can write your SQL program. Below is the example to display " Hello World" using SQL.1. Create a database named test_dbCREATE DATABASE test_db;2. Use the test_db databaseUSE test_db;3. Create a table named greetingsCREATE TABLE greetings (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
message VARCHAR(255));3. Insert the message 'Hello, World!' into the greetings tableINSERT INTO greetings (message)VALUES ('Hello, World!');4. Retrieve the message from the greetings tableSELECT message FROM greetings; Note: Try replacing "Hello World!" with your name in the SQL query. It's a fun way to see how databases store and display your own data! Give it a try and watch your name pop up!Why Learn SQL? SQL's integration with various technologies makes it essential for managing and querying data in databases. Whether it is in traditional relational databases (RDBMS) or modern technologies such as machine learning, AI and blockchain, SQL plays a key role. It works effortlessly
with DBMS to help users interact with data, whether stored in structured RDBMS or other types of databases.Data Science & Analytics: Used for querying large datasets, data cleaning and analysis. Analysts use SQL to generate reports and insights that inform business decisions.Machine Learning & AI: Helps in preparing and managing the data required for training machine learning models and AI algorithms. It is used for data cleaning, transformation, and extraction.Web Development: Used to manage user data, e-commerce transactions, and content management in websites and applications built with frameworks like Django, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails.Cloud and Big Data: SQL is integrated into cloud-based databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL) and Big Data platforms (e.g., Apache Hive) to enable seamless data querying and management.Blockchain and Decentralized Systems: In blockchain systems, SQL can be used to manage off-chain data, providing efficient data storage and retrieval alongside decentralized ledger technologySQL BasicsLearn the foundational concepts of SQL, essential for anyone working with relational databases. This section covers the syntax, commands, and key elements to start querying and managing data effectively.IntroductionData TypesOperatorsCommandsSQL DatabaseThis section guides you through the process of creating and managing databases. Learn how to create, select, rename, and drop databases with practical examples.CREATE DatabaseDROP DatabaseRENAME DatabaseSELECT DatabaseSQL TablesTables are the core data structures in databases, organizing data into rows and columns. This section covers how to create, modify, and manage tables effectively.CREATE TABLEDROP TABLERENAME TABLETRUNCATE TABLECOPY TABLETEMP TABLEALTER TABLESQL QueriesMaster writing SQL queries to interact with and manipulate data stored in your tables. This section covers common query types and operations.SELECT StatementINSERT INTOINSERT Multiple RowsUPDATE StatementDELETE StatementDELETE Duplicate RowsSQL ClausesUnlock powerful ways to filter, organize, and group your query results. Clauses help you refine your data extraction.WHERE ClauseWITH ClauseHAVING ClauseORDER By ClauseGroup By ClauseLIMIT ClauseDistinct ClauseFETCH AliasesSQL OperatorsSQL Operators" refers to the fundamental symbols and keywords within the SQL that enable users to perform various operations. Operators let you build complex query conditions.AND OperatorOR OperatorLogical OperatorsLIKE OperatorIN OperatorNOT OperatorNOT EQUAL OperatorIS NULL OperatorUNION OperatorUNION ALL OperatorEXCEPT OperatorBETWEEN OperatorALL and ANYINTERSECT OperatorEXISTS OperatorCASE OperatorSQL Aggregate FunctionsWhether you are calculating the total sales revenue for a particular product, finding the average age of customers, or determining the highest value in a dataset, SQL Aggregate Functions make these tasks straightforward and manageable.Aggregate FunctionCount() FunctionSUM() FunctionMIN() FunctionMAX() FunctionAVG() FunctionData ConstraintsConstraints act as rules or conditions imposed on the data, dictating what values are permissible and what actions can be taken. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and coherence of the database by preventing errors. NOT NULL ConstraintsPrimary Key ConstraintsForeign Key ConstraintsComposite KeyUnique ConstraintsAlternate KeyCHECK ConstraintsDEFAULT ConstraintsSQL JoinsSQL joins serve as the weaver's tool, allowing you to seamlessly merge data from multiple tables based on common threads. So explore this section to learn how to use JOIN command.JOINOuter JoinLeft JoinRight JoinFull JoinCross JoinSelf JoinUPDATE with JOINDELETE JOINRecursive JoinSQL FunctionsSQL functions offer an efficient and versatile approach to data analysis. Enhance your queries with built-in functions that manipulate data types and perform calculations.Date Functions String Functions Numeric Functions Statistical Functions JSON Functions Conversion Functions Datatype FunctionsLTRIM Function UPPER Function RTRIM Function SQL ViewsViews simplify complex queries and improve security by controlling data access. Views also act like a helpful security guard, keeping the most sensitive information in the back room, while still allowing access to what's needed.CREATE VIEWUPDATE VIEWRENAME VIEWDROP VIEWSQL IndexesImprove query performance by creating indexes that speed up data retrieval. IndexesCreate IndexDrop IndexShow IndexesUnique IndexClustered Index vs Non-Clustered IndexSQL SubqueryPerform queries within queries to solve complex data retrieval problems.

This section also covers the use of advanced functions and stored procedures to handle advanced database operations.Database Design and ModelingDatabase design focuses on creating an efficient database structure that is scalable and meets user requirements. Modeling involves defining relationships, entities, and constraints to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.Introduction of ER ModelHow to Draw Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)Mapping from ER Model to Relational ModelIntroduction of Database NormalizationFunctional Dependency and Attribute ClosureTypes of Functional dependenciesRules of InferenceNormal Forms in DBMSDenormalization in DatabasesDatabase DesignDatabase SecurityDatabase security protects data from unauthorized access, corruption, and breaches. It includes encryption, authentication, and user privilege management to safeguard sensitive information stored in databases.InjectionTypes of SQL InjectionData EncryptionDatabase Recovery Techniques in DBMSBackupHow to Restore SQL Server Database From Backup?Database ConnectivityDatabase connectivity enables applications to interact with databases through established protocols and drivers. This section covers how to establish secure connections and manage database interactions in programming languages like PHP, Python, and Java.ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)ODM (Object-Document Mapping)ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)Career & Job Opportunities in SQLWhile SQL is a key skills for various roles in the tech industry, but it is important to understand that most of the positions listed below require more than just SQL knowledge.
