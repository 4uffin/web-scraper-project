System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements. This specifically designed System Design tutorial will help you to learn and master System Design concepts in the most efficient way, from the basics to the advanced level.Why Learn System Design?System design is important for anyone who wants to build a robust, scalable, and efficient software application. Whether you are building a small-scale application or a large one, understanding system design allows you to architect solutions that can handle real-world complexities.Scalability and Reliability: System design ensures systems can grow and handle increased demand without failure.Efficient Resource Management: It helps in optimizing resource allocation, ensuring fast and responsive applications.Adaptability: System design enables the creation of systems that can evolve with changing business needs, reducing long-term costs.Architectural Understanding: Learning different system architectures (e.g., microservices, monolithic) helps in building applications suited to various needs.Interview Preparation: Mastering system design is key to excelling in system design interviews, commonly asked in tech company hiring processes.BasicsSystem Design Introduction - HLD & LLD Functional and Non Functional RequirementsHigh Level DesignWhat is High Level Design?
