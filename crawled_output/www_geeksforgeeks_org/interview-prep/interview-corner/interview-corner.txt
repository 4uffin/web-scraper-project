This article serves as your one-stop guide to interview preparation, designed to help you succeed across different experience levels and company expectations. Here is what you should expect in a Tech Interview, please remember the following points:Tech Interview Preparation does not have any fixed syllabus. Different companies, roles, and hiring managers have their own approaches. However, a few patterns have become standard over the years.One thing is, most of the companies take an online round first where they check your problem-solving skills using coding problems. Once you qualify the online coding round, you go to the next face-to-face technical rounds, that includes live coding and domain specific discussions.For students, the most important topics are Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object Oriented Programming (OOP), DBMS, OS, SQL, Web Development basics, AI, ML, and Data Science basics. Some companies ask Aptitude, Puzzle, and Design (Low Level and High Level) as well for internship.For early working professionals, the process and topics are almost same as freshers, with addition of questions related to previous work experience and technologies they've previously used.For more experienced working professionals, the process varies a lot. Some top product-based companies like Google ask DSA for all levels. However, there is going to be a lot more focus on System Design and technologies used in the previous companies.Let us now explore different interview resources.DSA GFG 160 - A complete list of top 160 questions + 90 bonus questions with editorials and video explanations.DSA 360 - Try our ongoing free course with weekly topic coverage with mock contests, short notes, daily problems and quizzes.LLD and HLDSystem Design Tutorial Design Patterns Interview Questions
