Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI and more.Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.Backed by library support, so we don’t have to build everything from scratch, there’s probably a library that already does what we need.Why to Learn Python?Requires fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages like Java.Provides Libraries / Frameworks like Django, Flask and many more for Web Development, and Pandas, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn and many more for, AI/ML, Data Science and Data Analysis Cross-platform, works on Windows, Mac and Linux without major changes.Used by top tech companies like Google, Netflix and NASA. Many Python coding job opportunities in Software Development, Data Science and AI/ML.Try our ongoing free course Python Skillup with weekly topic coverage, notes, daily quizzes and coding problems.First Python ProgramHere is a simple Python code, printing a string. We recommend you to edit the code and try to print your own name.
Python
print("Hello World")
OutputHello World
1. Python BasicsIn this section, we’ll cover the basics of Python programming, including installing Python, writing first program, understanding comments and working with variables, keywords and operators. Before starting to learn python we need to install python on our system.IntroductionInput and OutputVariablesOperatorsQuiz: Basics, I/OKeywordsData TypesQuiz: Data Types, Numbers, BooleanConditional StatementsLoopsQuiz: Control Flow, Loops2. Python FunctionsIn this section of Python 3 tutorial we'll explore Python function syntax, parameter handling, return values and variable scope. Along the way, we'll also introduce versatile functions like range(), map, filter and lambda functions. FunctionsPass Statement in FunctionGlobal and Local VariablesRecursion*args and **kwargs in Function‘Self’ as Default ArgumentFirst Class FunctionLambda FunctionMap, Reduce and Filter FunctionInner FunctionDecoratorsQuiz: Functions3. Python Data StructuresPython offers versatile collections of data types, including lists, string, tuples, sets, dictionaries and arrays. In this section, we will learn about each data types in detail.StringsListQuiz: List, StringTuplesDictionaryQuiz: Tuples, DictionarySetsArraysList ComprehensionQuiz: Sets, Arrays, List ComprehensionPython's collections module offers essential data structures, including the following:CountersHeapqDequeOrderedDictDefaultdictQuiz: Counters, Heapq, Deque, OrderedDictTo learn data structure and algorithm with python in detail, you can refer to our DSA with Python Tutorial.4. Python OOP ConceptsIn this section, we'll explore the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. From encapsulation to inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes and iterators, we'll cover the essential concepts that helps you to build modular, reusable and scalable code. Python OOPClasses and ObjectsPolymorphismInheritanceAbstractionEncapsulationIteratorsQuiz: OOPs5. Python Exception HandlingIn this section, we'll explore Python Exception Handling that how Python deals with unexpected errors, enabling us to write fault-tolerant code. We'll cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files.Exception Handling Built-in ExceptionUser defined ExceptionQuiz: Exception Handling6. File HandlingIn this section, we will cover file handling, including reading from and writing to files.File Handling Read FilesWrite/Create FilesOS Modulepathlib ModuleDirectory ManagementQuiz: File Handling7. Python Database HandlingIn this section we will learn how to access and work with MySQL and MongoDB databasesPython MongoDB TutorialPython MySQL Tutorial8. Python Packages or LibrariesPython is a huge collection of Python Packages standard libraries that make development easier. These libraries help with a wide range of tasks and can save you a lot of time by providing ready-to-use tools.Some commonly used types of libraries in Python include:PackagesBuilt-in Modules DSA LibrariesGUI Libraries9. Data Science with Python1. Foundational Libraries: These are the libraries that form the base for all data science work. Start here to build a strong foundation.NumPyPandasMatplotlib2. Advanced Visualization and Statistical Tools: Once you’re comfortable with basic data handling and visualization, move to creating cleaner visuals and performing statistical analysis.SeabornStatsmodel3. Machine Learning Libraries: After data manipulation and visualization, learn machine learning, starting with simpler models and moving to advanced ones.Scikit-learnXGBoost /LightGBM4. Deep Learning Frameworks: If you’re interested in AI and deep learning, these libraries will allow you to build and train neural networks.TensorFlow and KerasPyTorchTo learn more, you can refer to Python for Data Science.10.
