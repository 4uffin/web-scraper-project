C++ is a programming language known for its fast speed, low level memory management and is often taught as first programming language. Why Learn C++?C++ is often taught as a foundational language to aspiring programmers, but it is much more than that:C++ is used in making operating systems, embedded systems, graphical user interfaces and nowadays in High Frequency Trading (HFT) systems.It supports both low-level and high-level features such as manual memory management and Object Oriented Programming respectively.Syntax similarity with C, Java, and C# makes it easier to switch languages.C++ provides one of the fastest execution speeds among high level languages, which can be a deciding factor in Competitive Programming or high-performance applications.Example ProgramThe below code shows the simplest C++ program that you can run to print some text on the console screen.
C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
cout << "Hello World";
return 0;
}
OutputHello WorldC++ FundamentalsThis section guides you through the basic concepts of C++ programming. It covers topics that teaches you to write your first program, manage data, perform different operations and control the flow of the program.IntroductionIdentifiersKeywordsVariablesData TypesQuiz: Basics | Variables and Data TypesOperatorsBasic Input / OutputQuiz: Operator | Input OutputConditional StatementsLoopsQuiz: Control Statements | LoopsC++ FunctionFunctions allow users to divide the program into multiple blocks each performing a specific task. This section teaches you how to work with functions to write a modular and reusable code.FunctionsParameter Passing TechniquesDefault ArgumentsRecursionInline FunctionsLambda ExpressionQuiz: FunctionsCompound Data TypesCompound data types are created from the built-in data types. This section guides you through important compound data types such as array, strings, pointer and structures that helps in managing complex real-world data.ArraysPointersReferencesQuiz: Array | Pointer | ReferenceStringsStructuresUnionsEnumerationQuiz: Strings | Structure and UnionDynamic Memory ManagementC++ allows the low-level memory manipulation using pointers and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation operators. This section guides you through the basis of dynamic memory management.Dynamic Memory Managementnew and delete OperatorsMemory LeakQuiz: Dynamic Memory ManagementObject Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++This section covers key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.Object Oriented Programming (OOP)Classes and ObjectsEncapsulationPolymorphismInheritanceAbstractionQuiz: OOPs QuizC++ Standard Template Library (STL)This section covers Standard Template Library (STL) which is an in-built library that provides a set of commonly used data structures such as vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, etc. and algorithms that enhance productivity and performance.TemplatesStandard Template Library (STL)AlgorithmsContainersIteratorsVectorStackQueueMapSetQuiz: STL QuizException Handling in C++Exception handling are the techniques to handle runtime errors efficiently.
