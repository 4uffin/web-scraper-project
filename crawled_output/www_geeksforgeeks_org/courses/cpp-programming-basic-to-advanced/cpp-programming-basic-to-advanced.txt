So now let me tell you the reason why I am here after 2 years of my professional journey or why I am writing this testimonial now and not writing the testimonial that time.
After two years of my professional journey , I came back to GFG for upgrading myself and for learning the new skills which help me to enhance my learning.
I am always trying to be a happy learner of GFG.
Reviews and RatingsKunwar PratapPlaced in Axtria as a Data AnalystThe course is structured in a very great way along with a thorough explanation of the STL. This course helped me to write efficient codes for particular problems like which data structure will be suitable to reduce the time complexity. Also, code problems have time constraints and C++ STL helped me to write code within time constraints. In this course, everything was there that I needed like the internal design of the containers and how that particular container will be used. So overall this course helped very much in my coding journey!Chitturi Raja RajeswariPlaced in TCS Digital as a Systems Engineer The course content is very good and informative. I have gained in-depth knowledge about C++ STL, the coding practice problems have also helped me to learn to code using STL in the C++ Programming language. This course has also helped me to prepare for placements and got placed.Ritik BansalPlaced in Cerner Corporation as a Software Engineer InternThe course includes all the in-depth concepts for C++ STL. Especially the lecture videos by Sandeep Jain Sir really helped me to learn C++ concepts. The STL concepts explained in this course help one to write easy and efficient codes during Competitive programming challenges. I was able to crack Cerner Corporation, Samsung R&D, Cognizant, and Wipro in my college campus placements with the help of GFG Courses.Rajat SharmaSWE Internship at Microsoft The courses were structured in such a beautiful way that even with a little knowledge of programming, there were no difficulties in the learning. I have had a fantastic experience with GfG.
In beginning, I invested in GfG on the C++ STL course that was my first course and I found that useful, later I invested in DSA Self-paced. It helped me a lot in competitive programming by clearing all my basics of data structure. I reached 5 stars in CodeChef and Expert on CodeForces. Later I used GFG for practicing interview questions and OS DBMS CN for SDE Interview Preparation course for clearing all my CS core basics which ultimately help me to secure an internship at Microsoft.
Thank you GFG, Sandeep Sir, and all members who help me to make my future bright.View More TestimonialsFrequently Asked Questions01 Is there any number to contact for query? 02 How can I register for the course? 03 Can I make the payment through PayPal? 04 Is this a language specific course? 05 Is there a sample video to see how are the course videos? 06 What is the difference between the C++ content covered here and the one covered in the Complete Interview Preparation Course? 07 What type of certificate will be offered in this program 08 How long will the course content be available for? 09 Do we have doubt support in this program? 10 What features does Doubt Support have? 11 What is C++? 12 Why should I learn C++? 13 Can I use C++ for web development? 14 Do I need to know C before learning C++? 15 Is C++ still relevant today? 16 What are the career growth opportunities with C++? 17 What kind of jobs can I get with C++ skills?
