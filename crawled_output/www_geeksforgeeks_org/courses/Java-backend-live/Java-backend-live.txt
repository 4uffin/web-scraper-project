When I first started, I had many doubts and was completely new to application development. Before joining this course, I attended a Zoho interview with low confidence. However, after enrolling in this course, I noticed significant improvements in my thinking and communication skills. The initial phase of the course really boosted my problem-solving abilities and helped me gain a deep understanding of how to use programming languages efficiently. Within just one month, I acquired knowledge in Java, Spring Boot, caching, frameworks, Kafka, and more.
Although I wasn't able to complete the entire course, I gained enough knowledge to feel confident about fitting into this company as a developer. At the beginning, I faced some confusion due to language barriers, but the doubt-solving sessions allowed me to communicate with my mentors, who understood my challenges and helped me build confidence.
This course has been instrumental in helping me secure this job. During my interview, I mentioned to the HR that I was attending a GeeksforGeeks course, which motivated me to put in my full effort to achieve my goals.
Thank you gfgReviews and Ratingskrishna nitturkarPlaced at ValueMomentumWith the help of this course , First of all I got a proper
Java Backend Syllabus Structure. Then I got to know the concepts clearly and then the live classes helped me to learn Java Backend Frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA etc. The over all Knowledge I got from this Course was very High and It helped me a lot in learning Java.Liki LikhitaPlaced at DeloitteI was really pleased with the quality of the course, as well as the administration. I look forward to attending another. The instructor was very willing to answer questions from individuals, which is very helpful. Overall I'm very glad I have taken up this decision to do the course.
Prajjwal SinghPlaced at Deutsche BankI wanted to diversify my backend knowledge with Java Spring boot which happened to be ( as it was popular in industry )overwhelming for me and was unable to grasp concepts. I enrolled in Java Backend Live and the instructor was very knowledgeable and even better incredible software engineer he told us stuff that is not usually found in YouTube videos how to find stuff, debugging and reading console logs.Hitesh GargPlaced in Sophos I previously had zero experience in JAVA Development. I joined this course with many expectations and this course really did fulfil them. This course is not only about JAVA but its more than that you will learn many things like Redis, Kafka, Spring security and all. I was able to crack many interviews of JAVA just because of this course. A really good investment that I made.
Vishal PrajapatPlaced in Concretio Before joining the geeks for geeks Java back-end Development course, I have only a basic knowledge of java. But after that joining the live course I learned all the things which are demanding in the industry from a real-life industry experts mentor. They helped me gain confidence in working towards the projects, How you can manage the project, how to handle all the features and learned about various technologies like Java spring boot, Hibernate, Redis, Kafka, MongoDB, etc. Which eventually helped me to acquire a job in the IT industry. The content provided by geeks for geeks is the best part of my course and the journey goes from basic to intermediate to advanced level. It helped me a lot, I expressed my gratitude towards geeks for geeks family.Krishnendu GuptaPlaced in Walmart as a Software EngineerJava Backend development course helped me to understand the necessary technologies required to become proficient in software development. I got a fairly good idea about the technologies like Spring boot, Microservices, Kafka, REST API. The projects have helped me to understand the application part better so overall it has helped me a lot during my interviews.Kshitij KumarPlaced in HashedIn (Deloitte) The course was very good. It had a very structured syllabus. I had initial exposure to Spring Boot but this course and mentor explanation solved my doubts and also gave me good exposure to Redis, Kafka, and Microservices. I was really impressed with his teaching, explanation, and his guidance.Raman TayalPlaced in PhonePe I am a college student after learning Data Structures and Algorithms I wanted to learn some basic development aspects, that was a reason I joined this course after researching many websites finally found GFG Backend Development. In this course, I learned about Java Backend Development from very basics to a really good level. Mentor had a good experience in this field and helped where I was stuck. It was worth taking this course.Pranay Chary AmberpetaPlaced At Tata Consultancy ServiceThis course helped me a lot to understand more about the Java Backend Development, Which includes Spring Boot, Hibernate , Redis, Kafka.
Thanks for organising this wonderful course to all the students and the professional workers out there, thanks a lot.Mohammed SafwanPlaced At Infosys It was really good experience to get end to end knowledge from the Piyush.
