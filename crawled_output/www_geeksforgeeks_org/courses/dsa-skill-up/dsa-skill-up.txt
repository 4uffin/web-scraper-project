It combines in-depth theory through articles, daily coding practice, quizzes, and weekly contests. Covering key DSA topics like arrays, trees, graphs, and DP, its ideal for interview prep, placements, and competitive programming.18 Weeks60k+ interested GeeksCourse OverviewDSA 360 Preparation is a structured, week-wise Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course launching under the Skill Up Program. It is designed to help learners master core programming concepts through continuous learning and consistent practice. The course follows a logical progression, with each week dedicated to a key topic such as arrays, strings, recursion, searching, sorting, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming.Each week starts with detailed concept articles that explain the fundamentals in a clear and beginner-friendly way. These are followed by daily practice problems and quizzes that help reinforce the concepts and build consistency. At the end of the week, a coding contest allows you to test your understanding under time constraints, similar to actual coding interviews.The course is designed to provide a complete learning experience, starting from reading and understanding to applying and evaluating. Along with topic-wise problems, it also includes Problem of the Day challenges to strengthen your daily coding habits and develop problem-solving speed.Whether you are preparing for tech interviews, campus placements, or competitive coding, this course offers a guided path with the right balance of theory, practice, and assessment to help you become confident in DSA.DSA Skill Up
