ABDULLAH FAZILIPlaced at GeeksforGeeksBefore joining the Geeks for Geeks "Data Science live" course, I had only a basic knowledge of python. But after joining the live classes I acquired all the required skills from mentors who are real-life industry experts. They gave me the confidence I needed to work on the projects and how you'll turn boring raw data into something valuable using various libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, etc. The best aspect of my course is the material offered by geeks for geeks, and the journey goes from basic to intermediate to advanced level. It helped me plenty. I expressed my gratitude towards the GeeksforGeeks family, in particular to Arpit Jain Sir, who was so nice as to answer all of our queries patiently.View More TestimonialsFrequently Asked Questions01 What are the benefits of a machine learning and data science program? 02 How can a machine learning and data science program help me advance my career? 03 What career opportunities are available after completing a machine learning and data science program? 04 How will these classes be conducted? 05 Is there any number to contact for query? 06
