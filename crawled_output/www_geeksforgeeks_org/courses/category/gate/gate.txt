Their concise yet comprehensive content made studying efficient and effective. I found clarity on complex topics, boosting my understanding and confidence. Grateful for such invaluable resources.Daram Vishnu VardhanGATE AIR 2340I am writing to express my heartfelt gratitude for the invaluable role Geeks for Geeks (GFG) Mentors played in helping me crack the GATE DATA SCI 2024 exam and secure an All India Rank (AIR) of 288. A Big Thank You to GFG Mentors: A special thanks goes out to the GFG Mentors for their exceptional teaching. Their clear and in-depth explanations for Discrete Mathematics and Engineering Mathematics provided a rock-solid foundation that I couldn't have achieved anywhere else. The mentors' teaching truly stands out compared to other platforms I explored. The Importance of Maths, Bhai! As someone who scored a whopping 800 in CS, I firmly believe that mastering Maths is absolutely crucial for GATE success. Many platforms tend to overlook this important section, which carries a weight of nearly 13 marks! Geeks for Geeks: A One-Stop Shop Beyond Maths, Geeks for Geeks became my one-stop shop for GATE preparation. The user-friendly interface and the treasure trove of high-quality materials on Data Structures & Algorithms (the highest scoring subject in CS) were immensely helpful. In fact, I even used the platform to clarify doubts I had during my past college projects. The detailed explanations for subjects like Operating Systems and Computer Networks further strengthened my grasp of the concepts. Test Series that Packed a Punch I also want to give a big shout out to the Geeks for Geeks test series. The focus on truly understanding the concepts, along with the inclusion of technical numerical problems, made them exceptional tools for exam preparation. A Recommendation from the Heart Having explored a variety of platforms during my GATE journey, I can confidently say that Geeks for Geeks stands out as the most valuable resource. I highly recommend Geeks for Geeks to all future GATE aspirants out there. It will definitely give your preparation a big boost.KILAPARTHI VISHNU VARDHANGATE AIR 288I am thrilled to share my success with GeeksforGeeks (GFG), which played a pivotal role in my GATE DA 2024 achievement. I have secured AIR 951 despite not having a strong CS background. GFG's Doubt Classes were invaluable, offering personalized assistance whenever needed. Their in-depth syllabus coverage ensured a strong conceptual understanding, while the abundance of practice problems sharpened my problem-solving skills effectively. Despite offering top-notch resources and high quality, GFG charges very less fees so that it does not become a burden for any of the students. I, Anant Om, highly recommend GFG to anyone aiming for GATE DA.Anant OmGATE AIR 951I am incredibly grateful for GFG's Data Analytics (DA) course, especially since the DA paper was introduced for the first time this year. Finding proper course materials was a challenge, but GFG's DA course came to my rescue. Upon purchasing the course, I immediately realized that I had made the right choice. The course offered doubt clearing sessions, well-structured topics covering nearly everything, recorded lectures, and mock tests. These resources were invaluable in helping me understand the basics and gain practical experience with the types of questions likely to appear on the DA paper. One of the standout features of the course was the immediate provision of correct explanations for any wrong answers. This saved me a significant amount of time that would have otherwise been spent searching for explanations online. In summary, I am immensely thankful to GFG for creating such an exceptional course. I consider myself fortunate to have found it at the right time and believe that it played a crucial role in my success.Soumyadev SahaGATE AIR 441GFG helped me in understanding the most important concepts while I was preparing for my gate DA paper.Koyya Saketh Venkata SaiGATE AIR 2290Finding excellent articles elucidating fundamental Gate exam concepts was pivotal for my success.

Highly recommended for aspirants seeking effective study materials.KoustubhGATE AIR 3397GFG helped me a lot in my journey. Every time I found difficulty in my preparation, the name that came to my mind was GFG. On this platform, there is a lot of study material in a well-formatted manner. There are so many questions with multiple solutions, and a lot more...Prayas ChaudharyGATE AIR 1823In the GFG test series, I was able to find the new patterns of questions and the questions were very relevant. The test series assisted me in thinking about the questions in a new way. It helped me a lot.SUYASHGATE AIR 447geeksforGeeks has been instrumental in my success in GATE (CS) 2024. Their comprehensive lecture videos, insightful web articles, and challenging yet exam-oriented test series were the pillars of my preparation. Thanks to their meticulous guidance, I secured AIR 1856(GATE Score:632), a testament to the effectiveness of their resources. I highly recommend Geeks For Geeks to any aspiring GATE candidate seeking top-notch support and guidance.MAYUKH MAJUMDARGATE AIR 1856I recently utilized geeksforgeeks to prepare for the GATE exam, and I must say, it was a valuable resource throughout my preparation journey. It significantly contributed to my success. The vast array of study materials, practice questions, and mock tests provided me with ample opportunities to strengthen my understanding of key concepts. I particularly appreciated the clarity and depth of explanations provided, which enabled me to grasp even the most challenging topics with ease. Particularly I found GATE LMN last minute notes to be useful to me. So do give them a try.Sai Rahul NGATE AIR 3864The GFG's CS/IT gate course was awesome, it was the only place from where I studied for GATE, my only regret is that If I could have bought the course earlier and might not be that busy with final year projects, seminars, and semesters, I surely could have secured even better rank. The course was completely comprehensive, properly structured, and had even mock test and practice sections. All in one, it was a complete package.Soumyadev SahaGATE AIR 3874I was very undisciplined, so I needed some kind of framework, but I also study best at my own pace. The chapter wise recorded lectures helped me break down the portions into manageable chunks that motivated me to study instead of getting overwhelmed. I only studied theory from these lectures.it was well explained. Had I been more disciplined I could have taken advantage of the contest system and gotten a even better rank, but I am satisfied with this course even without getting the full value out of it.Ojas HegdeGATE AIR 565I am thrilled to share my experience with the GFG GATE CS Course, as it played an instrumental role in helping me to achieve an impressive All India Rank of 1316 in the GATE CS 2024 exam with a gate score of 668. I started my preparation in September; I had only 5 months to prepare for GATE. At the time, I had no hope of getting such good marks. I have attended GFG's CIP course, so I knew that their courses are structured, and thus I decided to take the GATE CS self-paced course for my preparations. Before discovering this course, I was overwhelmed by the vast syllabus and intricate concepts of the GATE exam. However, the structured approach and comprehensive content provided by GeeksforGeeks helped me navigate through the complexities with confidence. One aspect that truly stood out was the depth of coverage across all topics. From fundamental concepts to advanced problem-solving techniques, every aspect of the syllabus was meticulously explained, leaving no room for doubt or confusion. The well-organized modules and practice exercises allowed me to reinforce my understanding and hone my skills effectively. There are also articles for every subject, which allowed me to make my notes short, and for deeper understanding while revising, I referred to articles. The PYQs for all the topics and chapters helped a lot while giving mock tests. I have given mock tests on various platforms to get diversity. These simulated exams not only helped me assess my progress but also equipped me with the strategies needed to tackle the actual exam confidently. I am immensely grateful to geeksforgeeks, for their unwavering support and commitment to helping students excel in their GATE endeavors. Thanks to their exceptional course, I was able to surpass my own expectations and secure a commendable rank in the GATE CS 2024 exam. I wholeheartedly recommend the geeksforgeeks GATE Course to any aspiring GATE candidate looking to achieve similar success.Abhijeet KumarGATE AIR 1316For my DSA knowledge, GHG POTD helped me a lot. I practiced problems daily on the GFG Platform which helped me to build a logical and competitive mindset. Even on the day before the exam I did solve the POTD. Also, the plethora of libraries for Machine learning and Data Science helped me a lot.Saptarshi DuttaGATE AIR 2041My first attempt was a mediocre one and I just prepared around 3-4 subjects from geeks for geeks and was able to score way above qualifying marks, thanks to the quality content for geeks for geeks!
