C is a general-purpose mid-level programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. It was initially used for the development of UNIX operating system, but it later became popular for a wide range of applications. Today, C remains one of the top three most widely used programming languages.C FundamentalsThis section of the C Tutorial includes basic concepts that build the foundation for writing C programs. It teaches you how to store and output data, perform arithmetic and other operations, control the program flow, etc.C IntroductionCompilation ProcessIdentifiersC KeywordsC VariablesData Type in CQuiz: C Basics | Variables | Data TypesInput and Output in COperatorsQuiz: Input and Output | OperatorsConditional StatementsLoopsQuiz: Conditional Statements and LoopsC FunctionsFunctions are block of code that performs a specific task. They allow programmers to write modular and reusable code.Functions in CParameter Passing TechniquesMain FunctionRecursion Inline FunctionNested FunctionsQuiz: FunctionsCompound Data Types in CCompound data types are created from primitive data types and provides a different way to use them according to our needs. This section of C tutorial teaches you about the compound data types and how to efficiently organize and process real world data.C ArraysPointer in CC StringsQuiz: Array | Pointers | StringsStructuresUnionsEnumeration (or enum)Quiz: Structure & UnionMemory Management in CThis section covers the manual memory management in C using pointers. The dynamic memory management in C uses functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() to manually manage the memory while avoiding errors such as memory leak.Program's Memory LayoutDynamic Memory AllocationMemory LeaksQuiz: Memory ManagementFile Handling in CThis section teaches you how to work with files in C, including creating, reading, writing, manipulating and deleting files.Basics of File HandlingRead a FileRead/Write Structure From/to a FileEOF, getc() and feof()Delete a FileQuiz: File Handling C Error HandlingUnlike other programming languages that have automatic error handling, In C language error handling is to be manually done by the developers using error-handling methods, debugging strategies, and functions like perror(), strerror(), etc.Error Handling in CException Handling Using gotoFile Error HandlingDivide by Zero ExceptionMiscellaneous C ConceptsThis section explores various essential of C language that do not fit into a single category but play a vital role in C programming and provide advanced functionality to your program.C PreprocessorsMacrosQuiz: Preprocessors and Macros C Header FilesDate and TimeLinkageStorage ClassesQuiz: Storage Classes Advanced CThis section teaches you high-level C programming techniques such as multi-threading, signal handling, socket programming, etc which are used in creating high-performance robust applications and systems.Variadic FunctionsInput-Output System CallsSignalsSocket Programming_Generics KeywordMultithreading in CImportant LinksComparison of various programming languagesCareers and Jobs in CCompanies That Use CWhat's Next?Now that you have a strong foundation in C language, you can explore more advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C. Keep challenging yourself with our collection of practice problems to further strengthen you understanding of the language:Fundamental Practice ProblemsFunctions Practice ProblemsCompound Data Types Practice ProblemsYou can explore advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C to solve complex problems and you can also contribute to open-source projects, or even start preparing for competitive programming contests to and gain some hands-on experience. Job Roles for C ProgrammersC is worth learning in 2025 as it is still used for system programming, embedded systems, operating systems, game engines, networking, and high-performance computing. C programmers can work in roles such as:Embedded Systems Engineer: Engineers who develop embedded systems, that mainly concern on hardware and software integration for devices like IoT. Firmware Engineer: Create firmware for hardware devices to control their functionality and ensure proper operation of embedded systems.System Programmer: People who work on system-level software like operating systems, device drivers. Game Developer: Designs and creates video games ensuring smooth gameplay across platforms.Network Engineer: Configure create and manage computer networks (like LANs, WANs) to ensure efficient and secure communication across the network.You can use our list of carefully selected interview questions based on C programming to prepare for your technical interviews:Top 50 C Programming Interview Questions and AnswersCommonly Asked C Programming Interview Questions | Set 1Commonly Asked C Programming Interview Questions | Set 2Commonly Asked C Programming Interview Questions | Set 3
