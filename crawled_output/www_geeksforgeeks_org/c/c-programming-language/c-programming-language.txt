C is a general-purpose mid-level programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. It was initially used for the development of UNIX operating system, but it later became popular for a wide range of applications. Today, C remains one of the top three most widely used programming languages.C FundamentalsThis section of the C Tutorial includes basic concepts that build the foundation for writing C programs. It teaches you how to store and output data, perform arithmetic and other operations, control the program flow, etc.C IntroductionCompilation ProcessIdentifiersC KeywordsC VariablesData Type in CQuiz: C Basics | Variables | Data TypesInput and Output in COperatorsQuiz: Input and Output | OperatorsConditional StatementsLoopsQuiz: Conditional Statements and LoopsC FunctionsFunctions are block of code that performs a specific task. They allow programmers to write modular and reusable code.Functions in CParameter Passing TechniquesMain FunctionRecursion Inline FunctionNested FunctionsQuiz: FunctionsCompound Data Types in CCompound data types are created from primitive data types and provides a different way to use them according to our needs. This section of C tutorial teaches you about the compound data types and how to efficiently organize and process real world data.C ArraysPointer in CC StringsQuiz: Array | Pointers | StringsStructuresUnionsEnumeration (or enum)Quiz: Structure & UnionMemory Management in CThis section covers the manual memory management in C using pointers. The dynamic memory management in C uses functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() to manually manage the memory while avoiding errors such as memory leak.Program's Memory LayoutDynamic Memory AllocationMemory LeaksQuiz: Memory ManagementFile Handling in CThis section teaches you how to work with files in C, including creating, reading, writing, manipulating and deleting files.Basics of File HandlingRead a FileRead/Write Structure From/to a FileEOF, getc() and feof()Delete a FileQuiz: File Handling C Error HandlingUnlike other programming languages that have automatic error handling, In C language error handling is to be manually done by the developers using error-handling methods, debugging strategies, and functions like perror(), strerror(), etc.Error Handling in CException Handling Using gotoFile Error HandlingDivide by Zero ExceptionMiscellaneous C ConceptsThis section explores various essential of C language that do not fit into a single category but play a vital role in C programming and provide advanced functionality to your program.C PreprocessorsMacrosQuiz: Preprocessors and Macros C Header FilesDate and TimeLinkageStorage ClassesQuiz: Storage Classes Advanced CThis section teaches you high-level C programming techniques such as multi-threading, signal handling, socket programming, etc which are used in creating high-performance robust applications and systems.Variadic FunctionsInput-Output System CallsSignalsSocket Programming_Generics KeywordMultithreading in CImportant LinksComparison of various programming languagesCareers and Jobs in CCompanies That Use CWhat's Next?Now that you have a strong foundation in C language, you can explore more advanced topics such as Data structures and Algorithms in C.
