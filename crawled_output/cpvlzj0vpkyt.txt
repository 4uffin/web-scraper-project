Image source, PA MediaWhether you're dressed as a traffic cone in the Hollies or a professional cricketer trying to win one of the most prestigious white-ball competitions in the world, memories are forged on Finals Day that will last a lifetime.What a spectacular day this has been. Somerset won 11 of their 14 matches in the group stage and then saw off Bears and Lancashire to book a date with Hampshire, who had Chris Lynn to thank for their place in the final, hitting 108 not out from 51 balls in a chase of 155.The final lived up to the hype. Hampshire made a blistering start but were gradually pegged back just enough that their own batters were able to complete a record Finals Day run-chase - beating the previous best by 22 runs.Will Smeed came within six runs of joining Lynn as the only Finals Day centurions while skipper Lewis Gregory hit two sixes in three balls to win it with six balls to spare.Astonishing cricket drama.If you like that, we'll have plenty more for you from Monday, as Surrey and Nottinghamshire, one point apart at the top of the County Championship, meet at The Kia Oval, while Hampshire visit Somerset in Division One too.... bit awkward after tonight.Thanks for your company on this mammoth day, we'll see you at 10:00 BST on Monday.

Hampshire head coach Adrian Birrell speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra: "I thought we did quite well to get to 194. Toby Albert and James Vince were outstanding then we had a little bit of a cameo at the back from Benny Howell, so you kind of think at halfway you've got a score and then for a long time during that innings we were in the game but we couldn't quite just peg them back. Every over and boundary they were getting, I don't think we executed that well."It was quite difficult to defend here with the outfield being so slick with the dew that had come in. A bowler going down in Chris Wood didn't help either but we weren't quite on it with our execution and that hurt us."They batted very, very well. Will Smeed played a match-winning innings in a final and all credit to him."I'm very proud of my team, it was a good campaign from us but we fell at the final hurdle and unfortunately cricket is cruel."

Somerset's Lewis Gregory speaking to BBC Radio Five Live Sports Extra: "Unbelievable, super chuffed for the boys, we did it the hard way again."It's great to be part of this team. Year in, year out we're challenging for this trophy and to get over the line is mighty special."It's much easier out there than to be watching, I guess you're in control of things. When you're watching, you're wishing the lads to smash a few out of the park and to do it is an amazing feeling."We've been in tough spots and someone has pulled us out. We've got a team with guys who can win matches on their own and we've seen that over the past few games."

It was some proper hitting from Lewis [Gregory] at the end there as well."It almost felt like a home crowd today, especially given as we beat Warwickshire in the quarters."The guys have been unbelievable in the whole comp, different people have stood up in different games, I think that's probably our strength, we've got match winners one to 11 and if it's someone's day they can get us over the line."

Tell you what, we have had some stunning Finals Days down the years, featuring both Hampshire and Somerset, but have we ever had a better showpiece than this?Ton Kohler-Cadmore's knock of 81 in the first semi-final against Lancashire, Chris Lynn's astonishing and historic unbeaten 108 from 51 balls which helped Hampshire see-off Northants in the second, and then Toby Albert of the Hawks and Somerset's Will Smeed flirting with centuries of their own in the final.The regular season was a hum-dinger, and the knockout stages might top them off.If you can think of a better year, we're all ears...

Was that a turning point when Sean Dickson was dropped on eight by Scott Currie? There was still batting to come from Somerset so that's questionable. That's one to be argued on the coach on their way home back down south. It probably was a contributing factor at the very least but Will Smeed's 94 from 58 certainly guided Somerset home. For Hampshire, the wait goes on for their fourth title.Somerset are worthy winners, they join Hampshire and Leicestershire as three-time winners of the T20 Blast title.

Somerset skipper Lewis Gregory told Sky Sports: "We like doing it the hard way."To drag it
back after their powerplay to only be chasing 190 the boys did an awesome job. "They never got too far
away from us, we always knew one big over would bring us back to needing 10s. The boys in the middle rode that wave really
nicely. "I am super chuffed for the lads. We have got match-winners through our whole squad. We saw
players step up tonight. It's amazing to be a part of this group. "It was a brilliant cricket wicket and a great day."

They have been awesome throughout and are deserved winners tonight."You could argue we could have another 20 runs but then they managed to find the boundary when they needed it."We just did not quite have enough in the end."

That was Somerset's eighth T20 final, and their third win after triumphs in 2005
and 2023.As for Hampshire, they had won all three previous finals they had been in, in 2010, 2012 and 2022.No team has been to more Finals Days than these two sides and no side has won more than their three titles.This is a bit of revenge for Somerset's defeat by Hampshire in that 2010 final and means each side have now won three of their six Finals Day meetings down the years.It might be a touch awkward on Monday, however... Hampshire visit Somerset for a four-day County Championship game at Taunton starting at 10:30 BST.

That was a great bit of cricket equally from the batter because Will Smeed has hit that hard, he's unlucky but James Vince has done a terrific job there in holding his nerve and holding that catch.Hampshire are not out of the woods because Lewis Gregory is a top, top player.

Will Smeed moves into the 90s with a four to deep mid-wicket, his 14th, to go with a six, off the first ball of Benny Howell's final over.Sean Dickson gets his timing absolutely perfect with a reverse paddle for six and you have to think Somerset are on top now. Hampshire need a wicket asap.81 runs from 48 balls these two have put on.Smeed returns to the strike on 93* but is limited to a single by Scott Currie at deep mid-wicket.The final ball... IS ABSOLUTELY WALLOPED over deep mid-wicket by Sean Dickson for six.19 off the over. Somerset's to lose, surely?Scott Currie bowls the 19th.
