In contrast, Norwegian champions Brann had three chances on target, scoring one.They were penned in their half for large parts of the game, and only really made half chances, but in the end they dominated the only metric that matters: goals.

Marc Skinner's side dominated the match for 75 minutes in front of 16,019 fans - a record crowd for a women's match in Norway - with Ella Toone, former Brann forward Elisabeth Terland, and Melvine Malard all going close. However, they were frustrated by a strong performance from goalkeeper Selma Panengstuen, before defender Ingrid Stenevik headed in a 76th-minute winner.It gave the hosts the advantage heading into the second leg at Leigh Sports Village on 18 September. The winner of the tie will advance to the league stage of the Women's Champions League, while the loser will drop into the second qualifying round of the inaugural Women's Europa Cup.With several chances wasted, it seemed as if United didn't have their shooting boots on.And that was actually the case for some as news outlet Reuters reported players' boots had gone missing in transit on the journey to Bergen.Replacements were secured for those affected before kick-off, but United could have been out of sight inside the opening 45 minutes.Toone had two shots smartly saved by Panengstuen, while Norwegian Terland twice headed off target either side of having a shot from distance deflected wide by Stenevik. Panengstuen produced a sharp double save on the hour mark to further frustrate the visitors. First she got down well to deny Dominique Janssen and reacted well as United looked to pounce on the rebound. Panengstuen then kept out French forward Malard's header.Brann hadn't threatened Phallon Tullis-Joyce's goal until Stenevik found space in the box to nod in Signe Gaupset's free-kick.United rallied, but the impressive Panengstuen produced another fine diving stop to deny Toone. Analysis: United stumble at start of challenging periodUnited will return to England wondering how they're behind in this encounter.This was a largely one-sided affair in Bergen, with the visitors dominating possession and raining efforts on Panengstuen's goal.But the Norway international stood up to every challenge, with her late fingertip stop to deny Toone the pick of her saves.And where United lacked that clinical touch in attack, Brann capitalised on slack marking at a set-piece to take their only clear-cut chance.Trailing by just the one goal and the home return to follow, there's little need for United to panic and boss Skinner will take positives. His side were a constant threat going forward, with Malard lively down the left wing and enjoying several smart link-ups with Toone.Jess Park, making her first start for the club following her deadline day switch from Manchester City, was also a handful on the opposite flank, showing confidence in possession and making a couple of dangerous runs into the box.One area of concern, however, is United's squad depth. They named only five players on the bench in Sunday's 4-0 Women's Super League win over Leicester and, while they mustered seven against Brann, that included three outfielders aged 18 or under and two goalkeepers. Skinner is hoping Gabby George and new signing Fridolina Rolfo will be available for Sunday's trip to London City Lionesses.But with this Brann loss the first of four matches in 11 days, United will need all their options, and quality, during a challenging period.What's next for Man Utd?Manchester United travel to WSL newcomers London City Lionesses on Sunday, 14 September (12:00 BST).
