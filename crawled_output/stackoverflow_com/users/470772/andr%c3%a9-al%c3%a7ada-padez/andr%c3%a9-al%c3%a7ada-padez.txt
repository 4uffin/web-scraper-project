About
I'm a coder, a developer, mostly for web projects.
I'm constantly eager to learn and master new technologies, and my day doesn't end when i punch out the clock.
I obsess with code and algorithms. I dream about them and sometimes i wake up with a totally new approach for an impossible problem i've been having.
I love my life and wouldn't dream of doing anything else.
