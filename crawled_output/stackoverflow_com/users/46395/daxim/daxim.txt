About
daxim is a 44 year old German living in Austria. He has seen programming languages come and go, but Perl stuck. He enjoys doing things with the Web and system programming on Linux and likes consuming well-written documentation as well. He finds testing exciting. Five modules so far found their way to (?:Back|C)PAN.
Hobbies include wiki-gnoming, languages, drinking Club-Mate, music games, majiang and visiting the local Mongers and conferences (see below). He actually had to look up how to write a short bio to remember how to do it because he usually avoids things like that.
