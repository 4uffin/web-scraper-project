About
My greatest passion is technology. I am interested in multiple fields, and I have experience in software design and development. I started professional development when I was 6 years old and continued working and learning uninterruptedly. Today I am a strong full-stack developer. I love coding with .NET (C#, Azure) but in particular with Blazor and MAUI.
I started my blog PureSourceCode in 1998 to share my source code and thoughts about the developer world, in particular the Microsoft galaxy.
Also, I have started my company to offer my knowledge and experience to other people and companies: visit Nexty Solutions and keep in touch.
I'm working on my project LanguageInUse - built for the web in Blazor and the apps in MAUI - to help people learn or improve new speaking languages.
