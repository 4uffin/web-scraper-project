I am writing a bunch of multiframework target NuGet packages for .NET.
Most of them have dependencies to the typical Microsoft.Extensions NuGet packages.
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFrameworks>net5.0;net6.0;net7.0;net8.0;net9.0;net10.0</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net5.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="5.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="5.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="5.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="6.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="6.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="6.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net7.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="7.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="7.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="7.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net8.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="8.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net9.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="9.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="9.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="9.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net10.0'">
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions" Version="10.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions" Version="10.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Options.ConfigurationExtensions" Version="10.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
</Project>
It perfectly works and avoids version conflicts accross our base packages.
But is this really the correct way to handle it or is there some better solution than defining 5 different verisons (one per target framework)?

note: there's a lot to be said for dropping everything that is EOL (maybe creating a LTS branch just in case you need to issue an important update for legacy clients) - that'll leave you only 3 TFMs, one of which is preview. The next question then becomes : are you actually using anything specific in .NET 9 / .NET 10? usually via #if etc. If not: you don't need the ,NET 9 / .NET 10 targets - just let the net8 target handle everything, and will work fine from .net 9 / .net 10 consumers, maybe adding a net10 target when it is GA

Microsoft.Extensions... packages target .NET Standard 2.0 and so work in both .NET Framework and .NET Core. There's no need to target all .NET Core versions, only the lowest long-term version you intend to support. The lowest LTS right
now is 8.0, the previous was 6.0.

@PanagiotisKanavos no need to complicate things with NS2.0 here, though - all the targets are modern .NET

And even if someone wanted to support older versions, 5.0 wasn't LTS, was released in 2020, wasn't as popular as 6.0 (people didn't want to jump into a short-term version during the pandemic and 6.0 came out in 2021) and reached EOL in 2022. Is there a real-real need to support .NET 5 ?

If you need to support multiple versions, then you need to accept that your csproj file will have complexity like this. What you are doing is fine.

Despite their version naming, these packages are not dependantant on specific .Net versions, they're all .Net Standard 2.0. Replace all of those references with the latest stable (or unstable) version and it will work in all .Net versions with no issues.
At the time of writing, that is version 9.0.9, and version 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107, respectively. I'm using the 10 RC version with great success, myself!

yah, netstandard2.0 is an issue on its own. What I wan't to avoid is the nuget hell that sometimes occurs.
The code base is split up into several package bundles maintained by several developers. If one adds e.g. logging 5.0, and a year later on a new package one adss logging 6.0 and another year later one adds logging 7.0 sometimes it works when those packages are used in one application and sometims it doesn't (pacakge downgrade detected) 2025-09-17T20:49:27.653Z+00:00

So fix your build system then, this is a problem that was solved since .Net 1.0 with assembly binding redirects. 2025-09-18T00:06:13.987Z+00:00
