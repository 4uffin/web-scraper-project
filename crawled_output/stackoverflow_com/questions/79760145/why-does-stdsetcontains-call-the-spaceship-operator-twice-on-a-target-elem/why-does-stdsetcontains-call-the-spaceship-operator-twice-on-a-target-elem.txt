Why does std::set::contains() call the spaceship operator twice on a target element?

Consider:
#include <print>
#include <set>
struct Num {
auto operator <=> (const Num& other) const{
std::println ("{} <=> {}", val, other.val);
return val <=> other.val;
};
int val;
};
int main() {
std::set<Num> s{{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, {7}, {8}, {9}};
std::println("------------");
return !s.contains({8});
}
For the part that calls contains this prints out (among other things):
...
8 <=> 8
7 <=> 8
8 <=> 8
I would expect that after calling the spaceship operator with arguments (8,8), the set would know it found the element and can return true immediately.
Is this just because std::set in implementations I checked (libc++ and libstdc++) was never updated to move from using logic written for operator <, or is there a more fundamental reason for this? Is this still faster than all the time checking if compared elements are equal (since that happens at most once during lookup and moves the logic from handling two outcomes to handling three outcomes)?

Without reading the current standard, I'd say you're on to something. Previous standards said it used operator< (or was it std::less) to do the comparison and I guess that's still there.

It would call std::less twice, which in turn calls <=>. Set doesn't use == for equality, just comp( a, b ) and comp( b, a )

And on top of that it is traversing a tree, so you see the lookup being O(log n) when calling contains.
Which will do two more comps on each node

Are you sure @Pepijn?
I think only the last node reached is tested the other way, not the intermediate nodes.

@TobySpeight I am about the binary search, indeed not about the two compares along the way.

std::set bases its ordering of the contents on a template parameter. And the ordering functor doesn't test equality; it only says if one item is "less than" another. As such, set considers two objects to be equivalent if the ordering functor returns false for comp(A, B) and comp(B, A) (neither is "less than" the other).
So even if operator<=> is being called, set doesn't know that. All it sees is the ordering; it has to manufacture equivalence.

not sure this prevents asif optimization for case when comparator is std::less or std::greater, I know set can not unpack arbitrary comparators and see what they do, but very common case is that std::less or std::greater is used 2025-09-09T18:18:27.64Z+00:00

The comparator is std::less (the default). The thing is that equivalence is more general than equality. Eg you can have a set that considers all even numbers equivalent (by defining a<b as a%2 < b%2), still 2 and 4 are not equal. 2025-09-09T18:24:51.447Z+00:00

tbh not that sure...
maybe you can prove that equivalence is same as equality by considering return type of spaceship

Optimizations under the as-if rule are allowed only if they don't change the observable behaviour of the program. Changing from two calls to std::println to one would be a change in observable behaviour. 2025-09-10T00:13:42.21Z+00:00

That is only the case if the standard guaranteed those two calls to std::println; the standard often provides upper bounds on how many operations it will perform.
It is free to "magically" perform less; so if the writers of std::set< T, std::less<T> > know that being <=> aware doesn't violate the specs of the methods, they can optimize in std::set< T, std::less<T> > to use <=>.
The as-if restriction is the standard guarantees have to be kept, not the implementation has to be mimic'd. 2025-09-15T04:53:24.677Z+00:00

Sadly, it appears that under many ABIs, specializations of a template can break the ABI.
The names are mangled differently.
This can cause ODR violations if a library linked pre-specialization and post-specialization are linked.
So specializing std::set<T, std::less<T>> to be <=>-aware risks an ABI break, and many C++ standard libraries are very cautious about doing such ABI breaks. 2025-09-15T05:02:43.28Z+00:00

I am not really an expert in ABI, but why would this require ABI break? Can't they just if constexpr (has3w) new logic else old logic 2025-09-15T17:23:01.013Z+00:00

std::set compares items using a comparator comp that can only say whether or not one value is less than another. In order to check whether two values are equivalent according to comp, at least two calls are needed, because x and y can be determined to be equivalent only if comp(x, y) and comp(y, x) are both false.
By default, comp is an object of type std::less<Num>, which in turn performs the comparison using the < operator. When two objects of type Num are compared using the less-than operator, the compiler rewrites x < y into the form (x <=> y) < 0 because there is no operator< that can perform the comparison directly. So you get two calls to operator<=>.
