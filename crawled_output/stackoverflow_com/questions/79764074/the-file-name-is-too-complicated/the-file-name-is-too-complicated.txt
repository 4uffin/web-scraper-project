I am self-taught in developing Android.
While listening to several lectures, I noticed that the file name, class, and interface usage are different. If there is a file naming convention, I want to use it in a unified manner. What should I do?
I'm going to use it according to the MVVM pattern and the architecture recommended by Google. I want to organize the file names according to the purpose of data, model, viewmodel, ui, repository, etc. Also, I want to understand what class, interface, sealed class, etc. are created inside these files. For example, API uses retrofit to name interfaces and services. I would appreciate it if you could organize it like this.

Different from each other?
Well, yes of course they are different.
Filenames are different from class names.
I don't even understand what you are asking.

I don't know how to name the file according to the purpose. And I don't know when to use interface and sealed class.

The official Kotlin Coding Convention should answer the first question, and this Stack Overflow question answers the second one.
