In our device tree, both i2c18 and i2c19 are defined, and I’ve tested the Sense HAT on both buses. However, I’m not seeing any probe() messages in the dmesg logs, and the driver doesn't seem to be initializing.
Is there anything I might be missing to get the driver to probe correctly?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
