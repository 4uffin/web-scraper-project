Why does using wildcard path queries return empty results?

I'm encountering an issue with wildcard path queries in Apache IoTDB 1.3.4. When I use a specific path query, I get correct results, but wildcard path queries return empty results.
First, the specific path query (works correctly):
SELECT count(peak) FROM `root.ln.wf01.uhf1` WHERE peak < 10
-- result
+-----------------------------+
|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf1.peak`)|
+-----------------------------+
| 10|
+-----------------------------+
Then, the wildcard path query (returns zeros):
SELECT count(peak) FROM `root.ln.wf01.uhf`* WHERE peak < 10
-- result
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf3.peak`)|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf1.peak`)|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf2.peak`)|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| 0| 0| 0|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
But, I am sure that data exists in uhf2and uhf3
SELECT count(peak) FROM `root.ln.wf01.uhf2` WHERE peak < 10
--result
+-----------------------------+
|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf2.peak`)|
+-----------------------------+
| 4|
+-----------------------------+
SELECT count(peak) FROM `root.ln.wf01.uhf3` WHERE peak < 10
--result
+-----------------------------+
|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf3.peak`)|
+-----------------------------+
| 6|
+-----------------------------+
I expect that the wildcard query should return the total count of peakvalues < 10across all matched paths (uhf1, uhf2, uhf3), like this:
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf3.peak`)|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf1.peak`)|count(`root.ln.wf01.uhf2.peak`)|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| 10| 4| 6|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+
How should I structure the wildcard query to correctly aggregate results across all uhf*paths? What could cause this discrepancy?

I think you're using the wrong syntax. The examples in the docs (for 1.3.x) show queries using two asterisks placed after a dot ., such as SELECT x FROM foo.bar.baz.** - it doesn't look like you can use an asterisk as a wildcard for a substring of a component of a name (e.g. you can't do foo* - only foo.**).
