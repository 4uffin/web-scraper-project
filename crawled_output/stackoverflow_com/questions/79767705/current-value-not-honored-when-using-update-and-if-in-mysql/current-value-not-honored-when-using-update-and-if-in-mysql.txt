MySQL Update Causing Column Values To Change Midway Through Query

Closed 3 days ago.
I have an UPDATE query where I want to update the timestamp only if another column has a value of 2.
UPDATE Items
SET ItemActive = 1,
ItemStamp = IF(ItemActive = 2, NOW(), ItemStamp)
WHERE ItemID = 12345
Before the query runs, ItemActive is set to 2. When this runs, it updates ItemActive to 1, but does not update ItemStamp. What I am confused about; Since the value for ItemActive was 2 before updating, I would expect it to also update ItemStamp. But the IF logic seems to happen after the UPDATE changes the value of ItemActive. Weird?

Did you try to swap the to operations in the set clause: set ItemStamp first, then set ItemActive

For a single-table UPDATE statement, MySQL evaluates assignments from left to right. This is a non-standard SQL behavior that can be useful but also lead to unexpected results if you're not aware of it. The new value of a column is immediately available for subsequent calculations in the same SET clause.

For multi-table UPDATE statements, there is no guaranteed order for field updates.
