I have this Swift code
extension AddressSearchViewPresenter {
func presentAutocompleteViewController() {
let autocompleteController = GMSAutocompleteViewController()
autocompleteController.delegate = self
let fields: GMSPlaceField = GMSPlaceField(rawValue: UInt64(GMSPlaceField.all.rawValue))
autocompleteController.placeFields = fields
let filter = GMSAutocompleteFilter()
filter.types = []
autocompleteController.autocompleteFilter = filter
let navigationController = UINavigationController(rootViewController: autocompleteController)
UIApplication.present(navigationController)
}
}
When running it with iOS26, I have this output below. You can see there is a white circle just beside the search box. Why? No issue with iOS18 or less.

Whatever it is, it is probably something that Google needs to fix, not you.
