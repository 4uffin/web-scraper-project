I originally tried a sumifs formula but that did not work so came up with this work around.
=ARRAYFORMULA(SUM(IF(IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!A2:A1009")=$G$3, (IF(IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!B2:B1009")>=53000, (IF(IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!B2:B1009")<=53099, (IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!E2:E1009")
where G3 is a particular team,
column B references a list of expense accounts,
column E contains the values I want to sum.
I want to somehow combine this formula with a replica that evaluates the same criteria against an another range, like 54100-54999 in addition to 53000-53099. So in the end I want to sum the totals for 4 different account ranges in 1 formula.

Please make a minimal reproducible example that can be copy/paste/run without changes to illustrate the issue.
Make an anonymous sample document, including non-sensitive sample data and the formula you've used.

QUERY() may best fit for you. Share few sample data to your post as text table. Additionally you may share a sample workbook.

Are you using IMPORTRANGE to pull in data from another spreadsheet or just another sheet in your current file? If it's all within the same spreadsheet file, don't use IMPORTRANGE.

evaluates the same criteria against an another range, like 54100-54999 in addition to 53000-53099
Use let(), filter() and isbetween(), like this:
=let(
data, importrange(S3, "Sheet1!A2:E"),
a, choosecols(data, 1),
b, choosecols(data, 2),
e, choosecols(data, 5),
sum(filter(e,
a = G3,
isbetween(b, 53000, 53099) + isbetween(b, 54100, 54999)
))
)
See
let(),
choosecols(),
filter(),
and
isbetween().
To get the totals for several teams in one go, use query().

there are other ways, but you may try with SUMIFS:
Syntax
SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criterion1, [criteria_range2, criterion2, ...])
First you put the Sum_range and then all the conditions in pairs
=SUMIFS(IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!E2:E1009"),
IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!A2:A1009"),$G$3,
IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!B2:B1009"),">=53000",
IMPORTRANGE($S$3,"Sheet1!B2:B1009"),"<=53099")
