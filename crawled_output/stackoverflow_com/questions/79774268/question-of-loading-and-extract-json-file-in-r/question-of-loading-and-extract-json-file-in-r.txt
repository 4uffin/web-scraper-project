I need to read and extract information from a JSON file and load it in R. I could do it in python with no problem, but I am not sure how this is done in R, since the data returned empty after I tried to read the file.
Here is a snapshot of my code.

I don't see any code. Have you used cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html?

Welcome to SO. Debugging questions require a Minimal, Reproducible Example. Please edit your question so that it includes a sample dataset, the code you have tried, and that includes any library calls required to run the code. How to make a great R reproducible example has some great info regrading what to include in an MRE. Note that the code must be in text form inside a codeblock (```, then code on a new line, then ``` again on a new line) and not a snapshot/image. Thanks
