Escape characters with special meaning to the regex engine in PHP
(2 answers)
Closed yesterday.
There is a program php7.4
<?php
$text1 = "eggs";
$ll = 'e.g.';
$text2 = preg_replace(["/\b{$ll}\b/", ], ["<b>{$ll}</b>", ], $text1);
As a result of the execution:
$text2 = "<b>e.g.</b>"
It is unclear why the replacement occurs if the template and text do not match.
It is necessary that text1 remains 'eggs'
A solution could not be found

In regex . is a special character that matches ANY character. Escaping them in $ll will fix your issue, but you can't have that in the replacement as that will print the escape character. You should split it into pattern and replacement variable

Perhaps stackoverflow.com/questions/1531456/… would help.

Escaping '.' solved the problem
<?php
$text1 = "eggs";
$l = 'e.g.';
$ll = str_replace(".", "\.", $l);
$text2 = preg_replace("/\b{$ll}\b/", "<b>{$l}</b>", $text1);

Note that you can used strings instead of arrays, like so: $text2 = preg_replace("/\b{$ll}\b/", "<b>{$ll}</b>", $text1);, making your code simpler. My guess is that you want to do more replacements, but your question and answer don't make this clear. Always try to post a minimal, reproducible example. 2025-09-24T12:29:10.703Z+00:00
