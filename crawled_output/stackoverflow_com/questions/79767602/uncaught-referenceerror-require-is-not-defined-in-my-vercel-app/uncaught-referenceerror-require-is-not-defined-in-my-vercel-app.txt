Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined, in my Vercel app

Problem
I have a React app using Leaflet.js (v.1.9.0) and I host it in Vercel. Building works OK, but when visiting my app online logs this message in console:
Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined.
Where it happens
The file & line happening is ...assets/index-BKsOcw9k.js:67 where index-BKsOcw9k.js is a build file inside the dist/ folder. Locating it the code, it has this: ...QT.exports=e(require("leaflet"));e... and the problem is in the require.
My search
Searching around and asking AI, I understand that there is a problem with ESM and Leaflet (maybe, Rollup is included in the problem). I thought upgrading to Leaflet v.2 where it says it has Fully ESM support and that may solve the problem but there are conflicts with other packages (e.g. leaflet-draw, leaflet-geoman, etc...).
I import leaflet in my main component like that:
import L from "leaflet";. I've also tried import * as L from "leaflet";. None of them working when re-deploying in Vercel.
Thanks in advance!

Importing like that, it says Uncaught ReferenceError: L is not defined (L is necessary to other dependencies). If I do import L from "leaflet/dist..." it says: "The requested module '.../leaflet_dist_leaflet-src__esm__js.js?v=b41338d4' doesn't provide an export named: 'default'".

To not break css importing you need to use import with full path to ESM version of compiled lib:
import * as L from 'leaflet/dist/leaflet-src.esm.js'

Doing that, breaks the line import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css";. But let's say we skip it, it then says: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '.../leaflet.js?v=f90f8a1e' doesn't provide an export named: 'default'. 2025-09-17T21:58:50.42Z+00:00

Try to import without default: import * as L from 'leaflet/dist/leaflet-src.esm.js'. I updated my answer. 2025-09-18T06:42:05.257Z+00:00

Found out that the problem was in the leaflet-iconex plugin I use (as a file, not through NPM).
Its UMD wrapper "caused" the problem when checking for CommonJS module. The bundler was keeping the require() part:
} else if (typeof exports === "object") {
// CommonJS module
module.exports = factory(require("leaflet"));
} else ...
as it is, thus breaking.
Fixed it by just commenting out the code block.
