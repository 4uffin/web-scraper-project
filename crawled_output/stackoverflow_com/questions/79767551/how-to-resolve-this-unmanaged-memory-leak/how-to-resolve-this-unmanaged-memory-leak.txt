I've written a small mpv renderer for Avalonia using OpenGL.
So far everything seems to work except when I'm done and call dispose almost no memory involved with the renderer is released even though I destroy the native pointers in a safe way.
public class MpvPlayer : IDisposable
{
private nint _mpvContext = nint.Zero;
private bool _disposed = false;
private MpvWakeupCallback? _wakeupCallback;
private MpvOpenglGetProcAddressCallback? _procAddressCallback;
private MpvRenderUpdateFn? _renderUpdateCallback;
private AutoResetEvent _eventSignal = new(false);
private Task? _backgroundWorkerTask = null;
private CancellationTokenSource _backgroundWorkerCancellationTokenSource = new();
internal event Action? OnRenderRequested;
internal GlInterface? _glInterface = null;
internal MediaControl? _mediaControl = null;
internal nint _mpvRenderContext = nint.Zero;
internal ConcurrentQueue<CustomEventType> _eventQueue = new();
private readonly Dictionary<string, (object, MpvFormat)> _mpvPropertyChangeEvents = new();
public void Dispose()
{
Dispose(true);
GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
}
//initialise MPV
internal void Initialise()
{
if (_glInterface is null) { throw new Exception("OpenGL interface was null. Did you bind MpvPlayer to a MediaControl?"); }
var mpv = mpv_create();
_mpvContext = mpv;
if (mpv == nint.Zero)
{
throw new Exception("Failed to create mpv context");
}
mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "vo", "libmpv");
if (mpv_initialize(mpv) < 0)
{
Console.WriteLine("MPV failed to init");
}
mpv_request_log_messages(mpv, "debug");
_procAddressCallback = GetProcAddress;
var initParams = new MpvOpenglInitParams
{
get_proc_address = Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegate(_procAddressCallback),
get_proc_address_ctx = nint.Zero,
};
var enableAdvancedControl = 1;
byte[] managedParamApiType = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("opengl" + "\0");
unsafe
{
fixed (byte* paramApiType = managedParamApiType)
{
MpvRenderParam[] renderParams = {
new(){

new() {

},
new() {

new()
};
fixed (MpvRenderParam* ParamPtr = &renderParams[0])

nint mpv_gl;
int status = mpv_render_context_create(
out mpv_gl,
mpv,
ParamPtr
);
_mpvRenderContext = mpv_gl;
_wakeupCallback = MpvEvent;
_renderUpdateCallback = MpvRenderUpdate;
mpv_set_wakeup_callback(mpv, Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegate(_wakeupCallback), nint.Zero);
mpv_render_context_set_update_callback(mpv_gl, Marshal.GetFunctionPointerForDelegate(_renderUpdateCallback), nint.Zero);
}
}
}
//Start the background worker
_backgroundWorkerTask = Task.Run(() => BackgroundWorker(_backgroundWorkerCancellationTokenSource.Token));
}
//mpv event callback
private void MpvEvent(nint data)
{
Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(() =>
{
_eventSignal.Set();
_eventQueue.Enqueue(CustomEventType.Wakeup);
});
}
//mpv render callback

_eventSignal.Set();
_eventQueue.Enqueue(CustomEventType.Render);
});
}
//get gl procedure address
private nint GetProcAddress(nint fn_ctx, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPStr)] string name)
{
//this should not be null
return _glInterface!.GetProcAddress(name);
}
//main event loop inspired by the sdl gl example in mpv-examples
private void BackgroundWorker(CancellationToken ctx)
{
while (true)
{
bool redraw = false;
_eventSignal.WaitOne();
if (ctx.IsCancellationRequested) return;
CustomEventType _ev;
while (_eventQueue.TryDequeue(out _ev))
{
if (ctx.IsCancellationRequested) return;
switch (_ev)

case CustomEventType.Wakeup:
Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(() =>

if (_mpvContext.isNullPtr()) continue;
nint evPtr = mpv_wait_event(_mpvContext, 0.0);
if (evPtr == nint.Zero) break;
MpvEvent ev = Marshal.PtrToStructure<MpvEvent>(evPtr);
if (ev.event_id == MpvEventId.MPV_EVENT_NONE) break;
if (ev.event_id == MpvEventId.MPV_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE)
{
var prop = Marshal.PtrToStructure<MpvEventProperty>(ev.data);
var name = Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi(prop.name);
if (name is null) continue;
if (prop.data == nint.Zero) continue;
if (_mpvPropertyChangeEvents.TryGetValue(name, out (object ev, MpvFormat format) _data))
{
switch (_data.format)
{
case MpvFormat.MPV_FORMAT_DOUBLE:
{
if (_data.ev is EventSource<double> eventSource)
{
var value = Marshal.PtrToStructure<double>(prop.data);
eventSource.Raise(this, value);
}
break;
}
case MpvFormat.MPV_FORMAT_FLAG:
{
if (_data.ev is EventSource<int> eventSource)
{
var value = Marshal.PtrToStructure<int>(prop.data);
eventSource.Raise(this, value);

});
break;
case CustomEventType.Render:
if (_mpvRenderContext.isNullPtr()) continue;
var flags = mpv_render_context_update(_mpvRenderContext);
if ((flags & (1 << 0)) != 0)
{
redraw = true;
}
break;
}
}
if (redraw)
{
if (ctx.IsCancellationRequested) return;
//trigger render here
Dispatcher.UIThread.Post(() =>
{
_mediaControl?.TriggerRender();
});
}
}
}
//dispose
protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
{
if (!_disposed)
{
if (disposing)
{
}
mpv_set_wakeup_callback(_mpvContext, nint.Zero, nint.Zero);
if (!_mpvRenderContext.isNullPtr())
mpv_render_context_set_update_callback(_mpvRenderContext, nint.Zero, nint.Zero);
foreach (var p in _mpvPropertyChangeEvents.Values)
{
if (p.Item1 is IDisposable disposable) disposable.Dispose();
}
_mpvPropertyChangeEvents.Clear();
mpv_unobserve_property(_mpvContext, 0);
_backgroundWorkerCancellationTokenSource.Cancel();
_eventSignal.Set();
_backgroundWorkerTask?.Wait(300);
_mpvPropertyChangeEvents.Clear();
if (!_mpvRenderContext.isNullPtr())
{
mpv_render_context_free(_mpvRenderContext);
_mpvRenderContext = nint.Zero;
}
if (!_mpvContext.isNullPtr())
{
mpv_destroy(_mpvContext);
_mpvContext = nint.Zero;
}
_disposed = true;
}
}
}
I also have a reproducible sample at : https://www.github.com/saverinonrails/avaloniampv
I believe there is a leak because after manually calling Dispose(), say at a button click, I expect memory usage to fall substantially, to about where it was before we ran initialise(), but this is not the case.

That's quite a lot of code. Reducing it to a minimal reproducible example will help us help you.

I understand @wohlstad, I just didn't want to leave anything off incase that was the source of the leak. I'll try to reduce it. There's also a runnable sample at github.com/saverinonrails/avaloniampv if I'm allowed to link that

Posting a github link is ok as long as the sample behind is simple enough, but you really want to explain how do you see a leak (conditions, tests, etc.), maybe in another question

Your MRE needs to be included as text formatted in a code block in your post, not a link in a comment.
Please remove the code dump and replace it with your MRE.
Then also provide details that lead you to believe there's a memory leak.
You say memory is not released, but we need to know exactly what steps you're taking to come to that conclusion so we're able to reproduce the problem.

You're looping, queueing and dequeueing. I don't know where "dispose" is "called" (if ever), but you can count and see if your queue is running away.
