STM32 RS485 Communication: Data Truncated When Responding to MSP430

I am facing a data truncation issue in an RS485 communication link between an STM32 and a TI MSP430. The system operates as follows:
Baud Rate: 19200
Protocol: Modbus RTU
Communication Flow: The MSP430 sends a command, and the STM32 sends a response.
The communication from MSP430 to STM32 works perfectly. However, when the STM32 responds to the MSP430, the first few bytes of data are truncated on the MSP430 side. The sent data is not fully received.
Expected Response (STM32 TX): 02 03 0C 42 8D 3C FD 0F CB 0B BE 03 27 4D EC B1 CD
Actual Reception (MSP430 RX): 09 96 0E E1 15 70 1A 67 12 72 09 AF EE 0F
As you can see, the first three bytes are missing, and the rest of the data is shifted.
The MSP430 manually controls its RS485 DE pin (Driver Enable), while the STM32 uses the UART's automatic DE pin control feature.
I suspect the problem is related to the timing of the DE pin. I cannot modify the MSP430's code, so the solution must be implemented on the STM32 side. I tried to insert a delay before sending data, and it partially solved the issue but introduced a new problem.
Here is the relevant code snippet:
// Adding this delay fixes the truncation issue, but causes the next transmission
// to be a string of zeros.
//HAL_Delay(1);
for(uint8_t i=0; i<responseDataCount; i++)
{
LL_USART_TransmitData8(MODBUS_UART, modbus_request_buf[i]);
while(LL_USART_IsActiveFlag_TXE(MODBUS_UART) != 1) {}
}
while(LL_USART_IsActiveFlag_TC(MODBUS_UART) != 1) {}
When I uncomment HAL_Delay(1), the data is sent correctly, but the next communication cycle from the STM32 results in all-zero data. This suggests a timing issue where the UART or related buffers are not properly handled after the delay. I'm looking for a better way to manage the DE pin on the STM32, perhaps by disabling the automatic DE control and implementing a manual control with precise timing.

I don't see how to shift the actual received frame to match any of the expected response. Can you elaborate? Some bytes or bits are missing but which ones? Received ends with 4 1's together - the closest such bit pattern in the target data is the 0F at byte 7.

the STM32 sensor sends data, the TI MSP430 sensor is only receiving a truncated frame.
Missing Data: The first three bytes, 02 03 0C, are lost.
Correct Data Frame: 02 03 0C 42 8D 3C FD 0F CB 0B BE 03 27 4D EC B1 CD
Received Data Frame: 42 8D 3C FD 0F CB 0B BE 03 27 4D EC B1 CD (The first three bytes are missing)

That isn't what it says in the question. Please make it clear what was actually received. It looks on the face of it that you have a potential race condition where the STM32 responds before the MSP430 is ready to accept. Do the experiment with adding small delays and binary chop on the length.
