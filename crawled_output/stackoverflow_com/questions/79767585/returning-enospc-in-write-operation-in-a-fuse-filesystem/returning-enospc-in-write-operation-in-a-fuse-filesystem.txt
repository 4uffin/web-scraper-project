Returning ENOSPC in write() operation in a FUSE filesystem

While implementing a simple filesystem for FUSE, I have arrived to the write() operation:
/** Write data to an open file
*
* Write should return exactly the number of bytes requested
* except on error.
An exception to this is when the 'direct_io'
* mount option is specified (see read operation).
*
* Changed in version 2.2
*/
int (*write) (const char *, const char *, size_t, off_t,
struct fuse_file_info *);
The implemented operation works properly, except for the error received in the client application using the mounted filesystem when there is not enough space to write all data. The application (simple cp command) is getting EIO:
$ cp ../LOGO ../a/
cp: error copying '../LOGO' to '../a/LOGO': Input/output error
which is apparently coming from copy_file_range() as shown in this log fragment from strace:
copy_file_range(4, NULL, 5, NULL, 9223372035781033984, 0) = 488
copy_file_range(4, NULL, 5, NULL, 9223372035781033984, 0) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
The callback write() for FUSE is returning only an int with the amount of data written. So, my question is: how can returning a proper error (which would be ENOSPC - "No space left on device") be implemented for such case?
(Most likely, this should be something allowing to pass a proper errno to FUSE - but in case of write(), which is returning only size of written data, there seem to be no direct way to do this.)

Have you tried returning -ENOSPC?

The problem is, as I wrote in my question, that the write() callback does not return an error code, but written data size(!) Thats what many functions do, return a positive value for success or a negative error code. Also, the comment never said that it can't return an error code. It only specifies that, on success, it must (write and) return the exact number of bytes requested, its not allowed to write less, "except on error". It unfortunately doesn't specify what to return on error, hence I assumed returning an error code would work.

Yes, you are correct. Thank you. It does work with negated errno.

Per the libfuse documentation for the callback functions,
Most of these should work very similarly to the well known UNIX file system operations. A major exception is that instead of returning an error in 'errno', the operation should return the negated error value (-errno) directly.
Thus, if you want your write() callback to indicate ENOSPC as the nature of an error, then it should do so by returning -ENOSPC.

Yes, it works. It was a bit confusing that 2 different types of data can be returned (error code or data size). This actually makes it clear why the errno has to be negated (so that it does not "collide" with data sizes). Thanks! 2025-09-17T16:55:01.05Z+00:00

You're welcome.
FWIW, the standard UNIX I/O functions such as write() also return two different kinds of data, in much the same way.
The difference to libfuse is that the standard functions report an error by setting errno and returning -1, whereas FUSE expects error numbers to be conveyed directly in (negative) return values.
write() returning -1 does not mean that -1 bytes were written. None of the functions involved, FUSE or native, have any negative return values that convey success. 2025-09-17T17:06:07.787Z+00:00

That is clear of course. The -1 is however a standard (POSIX and whatever else) while the errno are (or, at least, can be) OS-specific. What in an extreme case could collide with data sizes in FUSE on an OS where a funky designer would make negative numbers as errno... That is why returning the code did not seem to me initially the right way (but, of course, I assumed that too fast...). Thanks again for help. 2025-09-17T17:35:39.153Z+00:00
