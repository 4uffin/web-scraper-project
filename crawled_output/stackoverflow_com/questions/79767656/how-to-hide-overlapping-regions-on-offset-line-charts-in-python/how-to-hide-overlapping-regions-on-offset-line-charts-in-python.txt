I want to make a "3d" offset figure of chromatogram traces. I am doing this by offsetting in both x & y but the background traces are "showing through" the area under the peaks in the foreground.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('stat-neg-GMtet-lin.csv', usecols=['Time (min)','TIC'])
df_2 = pd.read_csv('stat-neg-GMtet-lin.csv', usecols=['Time (min)', 'TIC'])
x = df['Time (min)']
y = df['TIC']
x_off2 = df_2['Time (min)'] + 0.35
y_off2 = df_2['TIC'] + 0.2
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [7.00, 3.50]
plt.xlabel('Time (min)')
plt.ylabel('TIC')
plt.plot(x_off2, y_off2)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.fill_between(x, y, color='orange', alpha=1)
plt.show()
I tried using the `fill_between' function but this still allowed for the background trace to show through
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('stat-neg-GMtet-lin.csv', usecols=['Time (min)','TIC'])
df_2 = pd.read_csv('stat-neg-GMtet-lin.csv', usecols=['Time (min)', 'TIC'])
x = df['Time (min)']
y = df['TIC']
x_off2 = df_2['Time (min)'] + 0.35
y_off2 = df_2['TIC'] + 0.2
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = [7.00, 3.50]
plt.xlabel('Time (min)')
plt.ylabel('TIC')
plt.plot(x_off2, y_off2)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.fill_between(x, y, color='orange', alpha=1)
plt.show()

I presume you're after something like this. Might help to include sample data in your question, and your current results/plot.
