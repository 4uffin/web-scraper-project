I have a use case where I would like to read the contents of a PDF attached to a Salesforce Opportunity.
I would like my script to validate bunch of text details from the PDF example - Quote number , Signature etc.
How can this be achieved ? Which libraries and Qwords should I use ?
I have seen this work in a session I attended but cannot recall any details on the libraries and QWords.
