I have a microservice architecture where my main service manages business objects (e.g., products) and stores their metadata in a database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
I also have a separate storage service that stores images in its own database and provides URLs to these images via an API.
My goal is to return product objects from the main service with all their related image URLs included. I want to do this asynchronously, ideally in a way that avoids N+1 query problems and integrates well with Pydantic for API responses in FastAPI.
What is the recommended pattern for:
Fetching related image URLs from an external service for each ORM object.
Enriching Pydantic models with these URLs efficiently.
Doing this asynchronously while avoiding performance issues?
Any example patterns or best practices for this scenario would be very helpful.
