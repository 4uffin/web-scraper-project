In 3Blue1Brown videos (at least recent ones), there is almose always a "table of content" at the beginning, with picture frames showing the different chapters we'll discover later. Those picture frames are animated.
I use ManimCE (which is a bit different). Is there a way to obtain that result easily? What's the mechanism used behind that? I imagine it's either rendering a scene and then display the video in the next one or load a scene from another. Either way, I'm not sure how to start on that.
