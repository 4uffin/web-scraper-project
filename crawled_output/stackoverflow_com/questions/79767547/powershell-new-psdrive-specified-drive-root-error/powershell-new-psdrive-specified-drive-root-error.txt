Powershell - New-PSDrive - 'Specified drive root' error

Using the following code snippet:
$Username = "administrator"
$Target = "\\target-win\ipc$"
$Password = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter password:" -AsSecureString
$Credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($Username, $Password)
cls
New-PSDrive -Name "X" -Root $Target -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $Credential
"";""
Net Use
I can map the hidden ipc share on the remote machine (as confirmed via net use).
However, I also receive an error:
New-PSDrive : The specified drive root "\\target-win\ipc$" either does not exist, or it is not a folder.
At line:10 char:1
+ New-PSDrive -Name "X" -Root $Target -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credent ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo
: ReadError: (X:PSDriveInfo) [New-PSDrive], IOException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : DriveRootError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewPSDriveCommand
New connections will be remembered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK
\\target-win\ipc$
Microsoft Windows Network
The command completed successfully.
The top section shows the error, while the bottom section shows (via net use) that the share does indeed get mapped successfully.
From what I've been able to determine so far, the issue only appears to occur when mapping hidden shares.
It does not appear to have anything to do with the target, as I can recreate the exact same issue mapping a local hidden share.
I've also confirmed that I can map other, non-hidden, remote shares without issue.
While I can use an if/else statement to 'ignore' the error, I want to try and resolve it if possible.
Any ideas/suggestions are welcome.

Yes, correct.
Alternatively stating, to test the validity of a users credentials remotely, you can utilize the ipc$ share.
net use \\<target>\ipc$ /user:<hostname>\username.
The share is not persistent, so you don't have to manually remove it.
Additionally, you don't need to assign a drive letter.
However, when using New-PSDrive, you are required to give it a "name", which is the drive letter.
No problem with your question, however, as shown above, the command does work.
I am just trying to determine whether or not that error can be stopped, as opposed to surpressed.

The administrative share named IPC$, as its names suggests, is used for IPC (inter-process communication), and not itself part of the file-system, so it isn't surprising that you cannot map a drive letter / name to it, which is what New-PSDrive by definition requires.
It follows that you cannot prevent New-PSDrive from reporting an error, and while you could just suppress the error, you wouldn't be able to distinguish the expected, irrelevant error from a true error, such as the target UNC path being non-existent or unreachable.
Thus, the simpler solution is to avoid New-PSDrive and to instead call net use (a direct call to the external executable net.exe), as it does not require a drive letter for connecting to the IPC$ share:
$username = 'administrator'
$target = '\\target-win\ipc$'
$password = Read-Host -Prompt 'Enter password:' -AsSecureString
net use $target /user:$username ([Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $password).Password)
if ($LASTEXITCODE) { throw "Connecting to $target as user $username failed with exit code $LASTEXITCODE" }
Note:
[Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $password).Password (using type System.Net.NetworkCredential) is a simple way to convert a [securestring] instance such as returned by Read-Host -AsSecureString to its plain-text equivalent.
For a PowerShell (Core) 7 alternative and a discussion of the risks of using plain-text passwords (unavoidable with use of net.exe), see this answer.
To readers wondering what the purpose of a net use call targeting the (inherently non-file-system) IPC$ share is: per your own feedback, it can be used to indirectly verify user credentials, i.e. a successful connection implies that the supplied credentials are valid.
