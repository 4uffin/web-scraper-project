I'm struggling to see what's going wrong here.
I have a solution with the following projects; Demo, Renderer, and RenderCore.
The dependencies are;
Demo -> Renderer
Demo -> RenderCore
Renderer -> RenderCore
I have a class 'Camera' in Renderer which I'm trying to use from Demo, but I'm getting unresolved external dependency errors on the functions of the camera.
I believe I've linked it up correctly as I can use other classes in Renderer and RenderCore from the Demo project.
I'm not sure exactly what I'm missing here.
This is my code: https://github.com/ultrapingu/Direct3D11

I'm not quite sure how to make this minimal, it has to be down to the specific settings / code of my project right?

Carefully read the link in my last comment.
Are you showing the exact wording of the error message, as that link requests?
Does this error really require thousands of lines of C++ code to reproduce?
