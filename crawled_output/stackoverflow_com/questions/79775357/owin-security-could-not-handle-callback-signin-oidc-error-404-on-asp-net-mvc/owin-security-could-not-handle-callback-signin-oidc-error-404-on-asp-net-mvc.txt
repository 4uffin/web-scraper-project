I have a simple ASP.NET MVC app with .NET 4.8.
I want to use keycloak as security management and my app connect to it via openid connect protocol.
To do this, I've created a startup.cs class in my project:
[assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(Mvc48Keycloak.Startup))]
namespace Mvc48Keycloak
{
public class Startup
{
public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
{
ConfigureAuth(app);
}
public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
{
var clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Keycloak:ClientId"];
var clientSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Keycloak:ClientSecret"];
var redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["Keycloak:RedirectUri"];
app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions
{
AuthenticationType = "Cookies"
});
app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
{
AuthenticationType = "oidc",
Authority = "http://localhost:8080/realms/aspnet", // my keycloak server
ClientId = clientId,
ClientSecret = clientSecret,
RedirectUri = redirectUri,
ResponseType = "code",
Scope = "openid profile email offline_access",
TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
{
ValidateIssuer = true,
ValidIssuer = "http://localhost:8080/realms/aspnet",
ValidateAudience = true,
ValidAudience = clientId,
},
RequireHttpsMetadata = false,
SignInAsAuthenticationType = "Cookies",
CallbackPath = new PathString("/signin-oidc"),
}
}
}
}
And here are my web.config settings:
<appSettings>
<!-- Keycloak Configuration -->
<add key="Keycloak:ClientId" value="myClientID" />
<add key="Keycloak:ClientSecret" value="myClientSecret" />
<add key="Keycloak:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44300/signin-oidc" />
...
</appSettings>
To test authentication process, I've simply placed [Authorize] attribute on Contact action in the HomeController:
[Authorize]
public ActionResult Contact()
{
ViewBag.Message = "Your contact page.";
return View();
}
At runtime, I get redirected to keycloak login form, but after that, when redirecting back to my app, I get this error 404:
The resource cannot be found. Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.
Requested URL: /signin-oidc
Apparently owin should handle the callback url but I don't know it could not!
Can anybody help me where is the problem and how to solve it?
Thanks in advance
