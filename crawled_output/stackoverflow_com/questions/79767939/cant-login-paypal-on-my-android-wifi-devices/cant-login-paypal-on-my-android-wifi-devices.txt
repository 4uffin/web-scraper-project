This an Android WiFi device without a SIM card. Currently, when I open the official PayPal website through the Chrome browser on the device, click to log in, and complete the CAPTCHA verification, why does the message "You have been blocked, we are unable to load the security challenge" appear? Does anyone know what this security challenge refers to? The device user is now unable to proceed with purchases.
Does anyone know the loading mechanism of this security challenge?
On my cellphone, login is normal. I want to resolve this problem
