I tried to use Image.adoptTextureFrom() to get the image created in the gpu to be shown on the canvas
Code: https://gist.github.com/brahmkshatriya/a955b6f5c056d2692e06cb423706f059
I tried to get the DirectContext of the current window using a reflection hack, there's probably a better way to get a DirectContext.
Unfortunately I always end up with the following error:
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to Image::makeFromTexture
at org.jetbrains.skia.Image$Companion.adoptTextureFrom(Image.kt:170)
at dev.brahmkshatriya.choco.ComposableSingletons$MainKt.lambda_1972921065$lambda$0$1$4(main.kt:86)

And there's no info on what went wrong, so I am kinda stuck here.

FYI - all specific details need to be in your question, not a link to your repo/gist. People should not have to visit an external site to figure out what you're doing. Please read How to Ask and how to provide a minimal reproducible example
