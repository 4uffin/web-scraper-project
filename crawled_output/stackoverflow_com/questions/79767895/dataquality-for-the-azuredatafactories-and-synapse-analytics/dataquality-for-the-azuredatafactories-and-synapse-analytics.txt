I'm working with several Azure data pipelines in ADF's and ASA, wondering what data quality solution you're using to make sure the source and target counts matches and other scenarios. We deal with a lot of manufacturing data in SAP as source and target is a Synapse warehouse.
Right now we are only relying on Azure log analytics to trigger the email alert and pipelines failures through service now.
Please advise me - looking forward to connect with people to understand this.
Any guidance to how to do data quality monitoring for my use cases.
