This is my onMounted call and the loadTripAdvanceDetail function here is responsible for populating the form for edit operations however it makes my form dirty and gives me the unsaved changes dialog despite of not making any changes. I added globalEvents.emit to solve this problem which conducts a check pre and post rendering but nothing still seems to work. This problem has been persisting across the board for me and I feel lost at this point. Any advice/help would be much appreciated.
// Initialize
onMounted(async () => {
globalEvents.emit(EVENTS.COMPONENT_LOADING, null);
try {
// 1. Load ALL data FIRST (while form is unregistered)
await checkAdvanceMode();
await loadLookupData();
if (isEditMode.value) {
await loadTripAdvanceDetail();
} else {
resetFormToDefaults();
}
// 2. Set travel type based on loaded data
if (isEditMode.value && vModel.value.domesticTravel !== undefined && vModel.value.domesticTravel !== null) {
selectedTravelType.value = Boolean(vModel.value.domesticTravel);
} else {
selectedTravelType.value = false;
}
// 3. Clean up the dirty state
form.resetForm();
await nextTick();
// 4. Register form LAST when it's stable and clean
appState().addForm(form);
} finally {
globalEvents.emit(EVENTS.COMPONENT_LOADED, null);
}
});
Adding globalEvents for checking before and after navigation was my first approach but it did not work, as soon as I comment out the await statement the dialog disappears so i know it is the one causing these issue.

Did you try adding a dynamic key attribute to the form element? When onMounted runs, change the key attribute value.
