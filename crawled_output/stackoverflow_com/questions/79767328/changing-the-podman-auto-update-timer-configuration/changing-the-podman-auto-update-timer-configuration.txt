I am trying to implement a system where I will be using podman quadlets and systemd for maintaining the service.
What I tried
Enabled the podman auto timer and verified
Edited the podman auto timer systemctl --user edit podman-auto-update.timer
### Anything between here and the comment below will become the new contents of the file
[Timer]
OnActiveSec=300
After edit
systemctl --user status podman-auto-update.timer
● podman-auto-update.timer - Podman auto-update timer
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/user/podman-auto-update.timer; enabled; preset: disabled)
Drop-In: /home/kiran/.config/systemd/user/podman-auto-update.timer.d
└─override.conf
Active: active (waiting) since Wed 2025-09-17 09:52:52 IST; 2h 47min ago
Until: Wed 2025-09-17 09:52:52 IST; 2h 47min ago
Trigger: Wed 2025-09-17 12:51:51 IST; 11min left
Triggers: ● podman-auto-update.service
The next trigger happened at the expected time
Trigger: Wed 2025-09-17 12:51:51 IST; 11min left
But after that, the trigger time has changed to 11 hrs
Has anyone faced this issue?
I have tried to view the file in Drop-in
`vi /home/kiran/.config/systemd/user/podman-auto-update.timer.d/override.conf
The output
[Timer]
OnActiveSec=300
I am trying to enable automatic updates in podman + systemd setup, I need the automatic updates happen at an interval of 300 seconds.

OnActiveSec= is relative to when the .timer unit itself was started, so it is effectively "only once":
at time X, the .timer unit starts (becomes active);
at time X+300 (OnActiveSec), the .timer unit triggers the service;
done.
For repeated activation it would be accompanied by OnUnitActiveSec= or OnUnitInactiveSec= within the same .timer – or maybe OnCalendar= – so you need to edit those as well.
(The OnUnit*= settings are relative to when the triggered unit i.e. the Podman service starts or completes, so every time the timer fires it re-sets itself. Meanwhile OnCalendar= is inherently repeating.)
Use systemctl --user cat podman-auto-update.timer to see the entire unit together with its drop-ins.

Thanks, I have tried OnUnitActiveSec= and it worked!!
OnUnitActiveSec= 300
OnUnitActiveSec tells systemd timer to trigger 300 seconds after the service unit last started. 2025-09-17T13:25:10.677Z+00:00
