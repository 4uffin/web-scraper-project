Unknown Memory utilization in Java Springboot 3 Application

I have setup Java 17 Springboot 3 Application running in Kubernetes pod (Amazon Linux) with limit and request 9 GB memory, 2 core CPU. The pod is only running the java application. The application is using high memory about 7.4 GB. When pod came up it was using 5.5 GB which increased upto 7.4 GB linearly.
When I compare native memory mapping and pod memory utilization, it is about 1.1 GB i.e. 6.3 GB and 7.4 GB respectively. From deployment, This difference grows with time within hours irrespective of increase or decrease of load.
When I check top, It shows 7.4 GB memory utilization for the java application.
JVM Options are as follows:
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512M -Xms2G -Xmx4G -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=5 -XX:+UseStringDeduplication
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:ParallelGCThreads=10
-Xmn3G -XX:ConcGCThreads=5 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=50 -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512M
-Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=detail -Xss512k
I added +UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:NativeMemoryTracking=detail to analyze this issue.

This memory utilization keeps on increasing with time, even if load decreases after some time. I am suspecting memory leak. So, I explored jcmd, But I am not able to pinpoint what is causing this increase in memory utilization.
How can I figure out the what is causing this unknown increase in memory by JVM?

To which increase are you referring to? You said that the application uses 7.4GB. Do you mean this value increases over time? Show in the question that increase.

Yes, The memory utilization of pod increased from about 5.5 GB to about 7.4 GB linearly. Will also add this clarity in description.

Compare a native memory report when using 5.5 GB to one for 7.4 GB and check what increased. We have no way to know what is needed for your application. Maybe it is normal usage. Does it keep growing after that? If not, you need to review your expectations.

We have no idea what your application does and how it's implemented, so we cannot even guess. Have you looked at heap dumps to find if there's a structure that grows uncontrolled? Do you have any static collections or maps, such as caches?

First try to identify if the suspected leak is in the heap or native memory. For heap see the answer above. For native memory you could use my previous suggestion. There is not enough information here to help.
