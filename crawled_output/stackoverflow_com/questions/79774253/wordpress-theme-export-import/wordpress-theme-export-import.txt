I can't successfully export or import a WordPress theme I created. I have tried several plugins and no luck. I had some success with all-in-one-wp-migration/ but it does not work all the time. there has to be a simple FREE solution out there. Any direction would be great.
Thanks,
Kraig

Go to your cPanel.
Check the php.ini file as well (max_execution_time, etc. ).
You should first convert your theme or backup file into a .zip, then upload it to cPanel and extract it.
Go to the Dashboard, then restore it from the backup.
Also, use this Plugin ---- https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ZJYO1O4ixJoWINf1B4KbfLU_jSocVoW/view?usp=sharing
This is the best modified plugin.
