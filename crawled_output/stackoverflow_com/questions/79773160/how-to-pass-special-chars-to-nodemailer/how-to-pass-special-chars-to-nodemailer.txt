I want to pass a string to nodemailer so that it results in
=C2=A0
i tried to pass in both 'Â ' (the literal chars), "\xC2\xA0", etc.
But they always result in =C3=A9
A longer example in case anyone can see a pattern. I pass chars that would result in:
=C2=A0=E2=80=8C=C2=A0=E2=80=8C=C2=A0=E2=80=8C=C2=A0=E2=80=8C=...
but get:
=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=8C=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=8C=...
i'm using only setting textEncoding: 'quoted-printable' in the options besides emails and html/text. Everything else is default.
If I pass the same string i'm sending to html on nodemailer via:
let out = ""; // line is the string passed to nodemailer's html.
for (let k = 0; k < line.length; k++) {
const code = line.charCodeAt(k);
out += "=" + code.toString(16).toUpperCase().padStart(2, "0");
}
console.log(out);
I do get the expected output just fine.

I think I was encoding wide chars wrongly with latin1 before. the utf8/unicode equivalent must be
"\\u00A0"; // instead of \\xC2\\xA0
"\\u200B"; // instead of \\xE2\\x80\\x8C
Now the email is encoded as expected.
