I'm writing a simple webpage to advertise stuff I've done, so basically my GitHub page but with more presentational value, also using it to get more practice with HTML, where as I'm more familiar with python, java, and C.
Anyway I have my "hero section" which is just a short paragraph where I introduce myself and my talents.
The CSS has the desired effect of typing each letter at a time but it does each line of my paragraph all at once, I want the entire text to look like it's being typed out in real time.
I'm not really sure how to fix this. I tried getting rid of white-space: nowrap but that just makes the entire paragraph appear as one line.
Getting rid of overflow: hidden just makes the paragraph super thin then widens it. I'm not really sure how to get the desired effect.
.hero {
overflow: hidden;
margin: 0 auto 16px;
/* centers block-level paragraph */
max-width: 100ch;
line-height: 1.5;
width: 100%;
white-space: nowrap;
text-align: center;
animation: typing 2s steps(400), cursor 0.4s step-end infinite alternate;
}
@keyframes cursor {
50% {
border-color: transparent;
}
}
@keyframes typing {
from {
width: 0;
}
}
<div class="hero">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ut faucibus quam, elementum semper magna. Duis in interdum leo, in pulvinar erat. Nulla eleifend felis fringilla dui fermentum, eget lobortis purus scelerisque. Aenean ante libero, iaculis eu est vitae, gravida luctus tortor. Vivamus vel lorem non mi porta efficitur quis et ante. Phasellus suscipit vitae tellus id tincidunt. Ut lacinia diam eu ipsum gravida aliquet. Donec id eros nec justo placerat consectetur. Ut accumsan quam neque. Sed vestibulum ligula quam, at maximus turpis rhoncus nec. Donec vel ex tellus. Nam interdum eget enim non ultrices. Aenean egestas sagittis posuere.</div>

You've got an interesting approach to this, but as you've found, it won't work with long text that needs to wrap lines. A better way would be to use JavaScript to add each character of text to the element over time instead of animating the width.
I've also played with the cursor animation, but obviously that's not necessary and up to you.
const text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla ut faucibus quam, elementum semper magna. Duis in interdum leo, in pulvinar erat. Nulla eleifend felis fringilla dui fermentum, eget lobortis purus scelerisque. Aenean ante libero, iaculis eu est vitae, gravida luctus tortor. Vivamus vel lorem non mi porta efficitur quis et ante. Phasellus suscipit vitae tellus id tincidunt. Ut lacinia diam eu ipsum gravida aliquet. Donec id eros nec justo placerat consectetur. Ut accumsan quam neque. Sed vestibulum ligula quam, at maximus turpis rhoncus nec. Donec vel ex tellus. Nam interdum eget enim non ultrices. Aenean egestas sagittis posuere."
const heroText = document.querySelector("#hero__text");
const typingSpeed = 20 // ms/char
let i = 0;
const intervalID = window.setInterval(() => {
heroText.innerText = text.slice(0, i)
i++;
if (i > text.length) {
window.clearInterval(intervalID);
}
}, typingSpeed);
.hero {
margin: 0 auto 16px;
line-height: 1.5;
width: 100%;
text-align: center;
}
.hero__cursor {
background-color: #000;
width: 2px;
height: 1em;
margin-bottom: -2px;
display: inline-block;
animation: cursor-flash 1.2s infinite;
}
@keyframes cursor-flash {
0% {
opacity: 1;
}
30% {
opacity: 1;
}
60% {
opacity: 0;
}
100% {
opacity: 0;
}
}
<div class="hero">
<span id="hero__text"></span><span class="hero__cursor"></span>
</div>

You can't achieve a typing effect with pure CSS, more like a slide reveal effect. You will need a lot of width splits to add in your keyframe animation to make it look great.
Instead, I recommend you to use Javascript to make the typewriter effect much better looking.
Created this fiddle to help you out: https://jsfiddle.net/o02wpfdu/
CSS for caret blinking. Looks cool if you want it to add that. If you increase the line-height and font, the height of the caret will match it, unless you specify a certain height.
.hero {
font-family: monospace;
font-size: 16px;
white-space: pre-wrap;
overflow: hidden;
display: inline-block;
line-height: 140%;
}
/* caret */
.hero:after {
content: " ";
margin-left: -5px;
vertical-align: top;
display: inline-block;
border-right: 2px solid currentColor;
animation: caretBlink 0.8s steps(1) infinite;
}
.removeCaret:after { display: none; }
@keyframes caretBlink { 50% { border-color: transparent; } }
Next we have the JS code that looks like this:
const text = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sunt voluptas deserunt harum, eum recusandae non corporis soluta tempore obcaecati qui culpa voluptate ullam illo sint dolore dignissimos distinctio similique adipisci!";
const target = document.querySelector(".hero");
const TYPE_DELAY = 50; // speed in ms per character
async function typeText(el, str) {
for (let i = 1; i <= str.length; i++) {
el.textContent = str.slice(0, i);
await new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, TYPE_DELAY));
}
// remove caret after finish
el.classList.add("removeCaret");
// comment the line above if you want the caret visible after animation
}
if (target) {
target.textContent = "";
typeText(target, text);
}
You can increase the speed by adjusting the TYPE_DELAY constant.
Hope this helps you.
LATER EDIT: Fixed the caret bug on on resize. Thanks to @imhvost
