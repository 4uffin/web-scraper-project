Eric Matthes, Python Crash Course(3rd edition) chapter 13.4.1
After completing the codes in 13.4.1, I achieved the desired results. Then I tried to remove new_alien.x = x_position in helper method _create_fleet since I thought it was useless.
What it turned out was truly weird: There was only one vertical column of alien ships moving from left to right! Could anyone tell me the workings beneath the strange phenomenon?

Welcome to SO. Please visit the help center and read How to Ask. You should edit and add your code. I (and I am sure many others) don't own that book so referencing it is useless.

That being said, sounds like if you don't initialize new_alien.x (probably to some random value) it defaults to 0 so they are all in a column.

what is Eric Matthes, Python Crash Course(3rd edition) chapter 13.4.1? Don't expect that people will know it, and have it. And we can't read in your mind. You have to show code in question.

use ``` to format block of code/output/error. And ``` to format inline code. Maybe visit few other questions on Stackoverflow to see how others ask questions, and how they format code/output/error.
