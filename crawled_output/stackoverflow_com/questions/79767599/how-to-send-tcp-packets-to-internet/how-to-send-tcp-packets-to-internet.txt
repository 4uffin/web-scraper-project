I am running a local proxy via Netty on Android. Through Nekobox, the requests are routed to the proxy, and then I forward them to the server. On the server, they are supposed to be sent to the Internet, but no matter what I try, I just get timeouts.
The server is written in kotlin.
On the server, I receive information like this:
server address
port
payload
The payload looks like this:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: cp.cloudflare.com
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip
I tried forming requests using OkHttp and Java Sockets, and in all cases I just get timeouts.
How i can forward requests to internet?
Server function to forward packets with OkHttp:
suspend fun forwardRequest(
destAddr: String,
destPort: Int,
payload: String
): ByteArray? {
val logging = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY)
}
val client = OkHttpClient.Builder()
.addInterceptor(logging)
.build()
val url = if (destPort == 80) "http://$destAddr" else "http://$destAddr:$destPort"
val firstLine = payload.lines().first()
val method = firstLine.split(" ")[0]
val path = firstLine.split(" ")[1]
val requestBuilder = Request.Builder()
.url("$url$path")
payload.lines().drop(1).forEach { line ->
if (line.contains(":")) {
val (key, value) = line.split(":", limit = 2).map { it.trim() }
requestBuilder.addHeader(key, value)
}
}
val request = when (method) {
"GET" -> requestBuilder.get().build()
else -> throw IllegalArgumentException("Unsupported method: $method")
}
try {
client.newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
return response.body.bytes()
}
} catch (e: SocketTimeoutException){
println(e.printStackTrace())
}
return null
}

If the difficulty is between your server and the destination URL (cp.cloudflare.com), you should include your server code. Without that it is difficult or impossible for anyone to determine the problem.

I added code and logs, but you can share any idea how it can be implemented in theory

FYI: hitting the url (from logs) with curl shows a 204 NO CONTENT response - how does your client handle that given that it is an empty response?
