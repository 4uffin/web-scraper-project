In a Google Sheet, I have four columns of data. col a date (number), col b month (text) and sol c year (number). col d I have four causes of death and each line has one of the four causes.
I need to create a stacked bar chart, with the dates combined into two month intervals, one bar wiht all four causes per two month interval, with the two month interval sorted ascending.
Ive spent 3 hours with chat gpt. 2 hours with Gemini. they cant get to the finish line.
The closest Ive come is, the bars displayed by month, grouped by two month interval labels, with the labels and bars displayed in alpha order. If anyone has any advice Id sure appreciate it.

Create a col for the 2-Month Label. I used "1stMonthName - 2ndMonthName" with =index(text(date(year(<date>),2*int((month(<date>)-1)/2)+1,1),"mmmm")&" - "&text(date(year(<date>),2*int((month(<date>)-1)/2)+2,1),"mmmm")) The key step: create separate cols for each death type, so each row will have a 1 in the col corresponding to the type of death on that date. Select all the data and Insert Chart > Column Chart > standard stacking. X-axis: 2-Month Label. Click the aggregate checkbox. Add each type of death as it's own series. The legend orders them in reverse order for some reason.
