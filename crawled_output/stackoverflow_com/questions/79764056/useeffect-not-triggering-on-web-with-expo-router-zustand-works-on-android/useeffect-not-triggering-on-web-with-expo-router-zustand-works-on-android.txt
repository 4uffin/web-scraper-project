useEffect not triggering on web with Expo Router + Zustand (works on Android)

I’m using React Native with Expo Router and Zustand to handle authentication-based redirection. The logic works correctly on Android, but on Web the useEffect is not triggered, which prevents the user from being redirected when their authentication state changes.
Steps to reproduce:
Set up Expo Router with Zustand for global state management.
Add useEffect to check authentication state and redirect accordingly.
Run on Android → works as expected (redirects when auth state changes).
Run on Web → useEffect does not trigger, so no redirection happens.
Root Layout file:
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useFonts } from "expo-font";
import { Stack } from "expo-router";
import { StatusBar } from "expo-status-bar";
import "react-native-reanimated";
// import { ReactQueryDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-query-devtools'
import { useColorScheme } from "@/hooks/useColorScheme";
export default function RootLayout() {
// Initializing queryClient
const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
const [loaded] = useFonts({
SpaceMono: require("../assets/fonts/SpaceMono-Regular.ttf"),
});
if (!loaded) {
return null;
}
return (
<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
<ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === "dark" ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>
<Stack>
<Stack.Screen name="auth" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
<Stack.Screen name="+not-found" />
</Stack>
<StatusBar style="auto" animated={true} />
</ThemeProvider>
</QueryClientProvider>
);
}
index.tsx file:
import { useRouter } from 'expo-router';
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
export default function IndexScreen() {
const router = useRouter();
const isAuthenticated = useAuthStore(authSelectors.isAuthenticated);
const isLoading = useAuthStore(authSelectors.isLoading);
const token = useAuthStore(authSelectors.token);
useEffect(() => {
if (isLoading) {
console.log('Auth state loading, waiting...');
return;
}
if (!isAuthenticated || !token) {
console.log('User not authenticated, redirecting to login');
router.replace('/auth/login');
} else {
console.log('User authenticated, redirecting to main app');
}
}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading, token, router]);
if (isLoading) {
return (
<View style={styles.container}>
<ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#007AFF" />
<Text style={styles.loadingText}>Checking authentication...</Text>
</View>
);
}
// Show temporary content for authenticated users (until you create main app routes)
if (isAuthenticated && token) {
return (
<View style={styles.container}>
<Text style={styles.title}>Welcome Back!</Text>
<Text style={styles.subtitle}>You are successfully authenticated</Text>
<Text style={styles.note}>
TODO: This will redirect to your main app once you create those routes
</Text>
</View>
);
}
return (
<View style={styles.container}>
<Text style={styles.title}>Welcome to Your App</Text>
<Text style={styles.subtitle}>Loading...</Text>
</View>
);
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
container: {
flex: 1,
justifyContent: 'center',
alignItems: 'center',
backgroundColor: '#fff',
},
title: {
fontSize: 24,
fontWeight: 'bold',
marginBottom: 16,
},
subtitle: {
fontSize: 16,
color: '#666',
marginBottom: 8,
},
loadingText: {
fontSize: 16,
color: '#666',
marginTop: 16,
},
note: {
fontSize: 14,
color: '#888',
fontStyle: 'italic',
textAlign: 'center',
paddingHorizontal: 32,
marginTop: 16,
},
});
authStore:
import { create } from "zustand";
import { createJSONStorage, persist } from "zustand/middleware";
import { logger } from "../utils/logger";
export interface User {
id: string;
email: string;
name?: string;
avatar?: string;
role?: string;
}
type AuthState = {
// State properties
token: string | null;
user: User | null;
isAuthenticated: boolean;
isLoading: boolean;
error: string | null;
// Actions - Command Pattern implementation
setToken: (token: string) => void;
setUser: (user: User) => void;
setError: (error: string | null) => void;
setLoading: (loading: boolean) => void;
clearAuth: () => void;
// Computed getters
getAuthHeader: () => string | null;
};
export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>()(
persist(
(set, get) => ({
// Initial state
token: null,
user: null,
isAuthenticated: false,
isLoading: false,
error: null,
// Actions
setToken: (token: string) => {
logger.info("Setting authentication token");
set({
token,
isAuthenticated: true,
error: null,
});
},
setUser: (user: User) => {
logger.info("Setting user data", {
userId: user.id,
email: user.email,
});
set({ user });
},
setError: (error: string | null) => {
logger.info("Setting auth error", { error });
set({ error, isLoading: false });
},
setLoading: (isLoading: boolean) => {
set({ isLoading });
},
clearAuth: () => {
logger.info("Clearing authentication data");
set({
token: null,
user: null,
isAuthenticated: false,
isLoading: false,
error: null,
});
},
getAuthHeader: () => {
const { token } = get();
return token ? `Bearer ${token}` : null;
},
}),
{
name: "auth-storage", // Storage key
storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage),
partialize: (state) => ({
token: state.token,
user: state.user,
isAuthenticated: state.isAuthenticated,
}),
onRehydrateStorage: () => (state) => {
if (state) {
logger.info("Auth state rehydrated from storage");
// Validate token on rehydration if needed
if (state.token && !state.isAuthenticated) {
state.isAuthenticated = true;
}
}
},
},
),
);
export const authSelectors = {
// Authentication status selectors
isAuthenticated: (state: AuthState) => state.isAuthenticated,
isLoading: (state: AuthState) => state.isLoading,
hasError: (state: AuthState) => !!state.error,
// Data selectors
token: (state: AuthState) => state.token,
user: (state: AuthState) => state.user,
error: (state: AuthState) => state.error,
// Computed selectors
userDisplayName: (state: AuthState) =>
state.user?.name || state.user?.email?.split("@")[0] || "User",
authHeader: (state: AuthState) => state.getAuthHeader(),
};
Expected behavior:
useEffect should trigger on Web the same way it does on Android, ensuring that users are redirected based on their authentication state.
No logs are visible on web.
Environment:
Expo SDK: "~53.0.22"
React Native: "0.79.6"
Expo Router: "~5.1.5"
Zustand: "^5.0.8"
Platforms tested: Android , Web
I have tried multiple approaches, including updating the state with the spread operator, using localStorage specifically for Web, and even replacing Zustand with Redux. However, the problem persists — useEffect still does not trigger on Web.
