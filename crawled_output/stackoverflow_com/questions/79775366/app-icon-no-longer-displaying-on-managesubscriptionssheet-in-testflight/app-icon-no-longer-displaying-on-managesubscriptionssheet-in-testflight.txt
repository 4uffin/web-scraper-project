I'm having an issue with my app icon no longer being displayed on my .manageSubscriptions sheet in Testflight. It displays fine on the .manageSubscriptionsSheet in Xcode. However, I've noticed that the .manageSubscriptionsSheet also looks a little different in TestFlight now. It used to be identical to Xcode. I believe that this may have happened when I decided to try out a new App Icon (different color/style) and deleted my old set from my app. I then ended up changing my mind and reverted back to the old icon set. Now however, .manageSubscriptionsSheet no longer shows my app icon. See below screen shots.
Xcode display of .manageSubscriptionsSheet - icon shows:
TestFlight display of .manageSubscriptionSheet - icon does NOT show. Additionally, there are two screens now instead of just the one that I see with Xcode:
Has anyone else run into this problem? I've tried/done the following:
deleting the entire icon set and re-added it
verified that all icons are in Assets.xcassets
verified that icons are (ios-marketing.png in particular) Color
space=RGB, Color profile=sRGB IEC61966-2.1, Dimensions:1024x1024,
and Alpha channel=No
deleted derived data
cleaned the build folder
checked that my scheme for TestFlight has "None" for StoreKit
configuration before pushing a new version to TestFlight
checked my subscriptions in AppStore Connect - everything is
there/approved like it was before
deleted the app off of my phone and reinstalled it
restarted my phone and reinstalled app from TestFlight
Nothing has worked so far. Any thoughts as to what I should check next?
