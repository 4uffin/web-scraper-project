im trying to get a map of a room where i can pan over that extends past the normal viewing range, allowing it to be viewed easily on all screen sizes, however the interactable section of the interactiveviewer is cut off by what it can see initially. One almost fix i found is using overflowbox however it only extends what is painted and not what can be interacted hence leaving boxes that i cannot click on. Any help to how i can fix this flaw would be greatly appreciated!

tried constrained: false already? the docs say: '''If set to false, then the child will be given infinite constraints. This is often useful when a child should be bigger than the InteractiveViewer.'''
