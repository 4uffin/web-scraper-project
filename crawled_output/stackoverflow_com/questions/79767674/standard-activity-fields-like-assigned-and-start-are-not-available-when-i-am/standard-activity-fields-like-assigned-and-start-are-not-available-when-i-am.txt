I need to create a custom report type that includes three objects: Account, Activity, and Visit. I have successfully created the report type, but I've noticed that certain standard fields, such as "Assigned" and "Start" on the Activity object, are not appearing in the report type. I compared it with the standard report type "Activities with Accounts," where these fields are accessible, but they are missing in my custom report type.
