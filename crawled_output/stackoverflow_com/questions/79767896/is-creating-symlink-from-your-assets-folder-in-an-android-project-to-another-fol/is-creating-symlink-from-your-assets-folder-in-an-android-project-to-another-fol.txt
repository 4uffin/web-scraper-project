Let's just say you have a project for both Desktop and Android. On Desktop you have your folder structure. Then for Android all your files should go into your assets or res folders, right? Because I don't want to have two sets of files, which is what would result from a copy into the assets folder, can I make a symlink for the assets folder that points to the other folder? Is this a 'conventional' way of doing things or not? What is a good approach here? I'm don't have any Android experience.
