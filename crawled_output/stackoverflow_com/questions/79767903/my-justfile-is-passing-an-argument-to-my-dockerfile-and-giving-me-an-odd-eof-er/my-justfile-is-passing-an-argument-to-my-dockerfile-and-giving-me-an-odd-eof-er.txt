My .justfile is passing an argument to my Dockerfile and giving me an odd EOF error

I have a Docker build process that requires access to my AWS Code Artifact repository for Python packages that I store there. This is my Dockerfile. Notice that it accepts PYTHON_REPO_URL and uses it for pip's extra-index-url.
ARG FUNCTION_DIR="/function/"
FROM python:3.9 AS build
ARG FUNCTION_DIR
ARG PYTHON_REPO_URL
RUN echo $PYTHON_REPO_URL
RUN mkdir -p ${FUNCTION_DIR}
COPY requirements.txt ${FUNCTION_DIR}
WORKDIR ${FUNCTION_DIR}
ARG PIP_ROOT_USER_ACTION=ignore
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
pip install --target ${FUNCTION_DIR} awslambdaric && \
pip install --target ${FUNCTION_DIR} --no-warn-script-location -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url ${PYTHON_REPO_URL}
FROM python:3.9
ARG FUNCTION_DIR
WORKDIR ${FUNCTION_DIR}
COPY --from=build ${FUNCTION_DIR} ${FUNCTION_DIR}
COPY main.py ${FUNCTION_DIR}
ENV MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/mplconfig
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/python", "-m", "awslambdaric"]
CMD ["main.handler"]
And it's supposed to build with this .justfile
tag := "compute-lambda"
aws_region := "us-east-1"
codeart_domain := "blahblahblah"
codeart_owner := "1234567890"
codeart_repo := "blahblah"
build:
TOKEN=$(aws codeartifact get-authorization-token \
--domain {{codeart_domain}} \
--domain-owner {{codeart_owner}} \
--region {{aws_region}} \
--query authorizationToken \
--output text) && \
PYTHON_REPO_URL="https://aws:${TOKEN}@{{codeart_domain}}-{{codeart_owner}}.d.codeartifact.{{aws_region}}.amazonaws.com/pypi/{{codeart_repo}}/simple/" && \
echo ${PYTHON_REPO_URL} && \
docker build --build-arg PYTHON_REPO_URL="$PYTHON_REPO_URL" -t {{tag}} .
What's happening is I'm getting this error:
unexpected EOF
error: Recipe `build` failed on line 17 with exit code 1
This happened after adding PYTHON_REPO_URL to the mix. The odd thing is, the echo's show that the URL is well formed and has the token as part of it and everything. Interestingly enough when I invoke the command on the command line manually it works just fine. I can look at the echo's output of my repo URL, and do this:
export PYTHON_REPO_URL="the url that was printed"
docker build --build-arg PYTHON_REPO_URL="$PYTHON_REPO_URL" -t compute-lambda .
And it works perfectly fine.
What is this .justfile doing that's different and how did I mess it up? And why isn't the error more clear than "unexpected EOF?"
