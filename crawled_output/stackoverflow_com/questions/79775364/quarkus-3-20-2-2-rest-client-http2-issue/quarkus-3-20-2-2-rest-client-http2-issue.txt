Quarkus 3.20.2.2 Rest client HTTP2 issue

When the application is built with Quarkus 3.20.2 the REST client successfully establishes an HTTP/2 connection to the OpenShift REST endpoint (enabled via quarkus.rest-client.http2=true).
After upgrading to Quarkus 3.20.2.2 or 3.20.3, the same code fails with
java.io.Exception: Stream was closed (GOAWAY error code = 0)
change quarkus platform version again to 3.20.2 and it works without any code change.
BTW I am using Uni<> as return type in my @RestClient interface.
any idea ?
thanks
