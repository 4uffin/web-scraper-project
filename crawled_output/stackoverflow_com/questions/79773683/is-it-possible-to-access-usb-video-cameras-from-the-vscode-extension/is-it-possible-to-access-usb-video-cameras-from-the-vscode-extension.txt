Is it possible to access USB video cameras from the VSCode extension?

I would like to have the image from video camera (usb web-cameras) built-in into VSCode.
I tried to create an extension using webview-view-sample, but it looks like I have a permission issue when accessing the camera:
try {
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
} catch (err) {
console.error('Error accessing camera:', err); // I see this
}
It works fine in a regular browser, but not inside VS Code.
Is there any way to bypass this permission problem?
Or maybe another way to get images from the camera within a VS Code extension (without webview)?
P.S. I also tried streaming the camera feed to HLS (via ffmpeg) and displaying it in a
element using hls.js. It works, but the latency is too high.
