I have BE written in Hono, that is providing auth using better-auth and Expo app that consumes it (I am using ios in development, not Expo Go). I m working with cookie-based auth that is proposed by better-auth. Email + password auth works just as expected, the response contains cookie in header that I save using CookieManager, but when I try to access cookie header from Google signIn, then its always empty.
Why is the response from google signIn without the cookie header?
I am not sure if the problem might come from TrustedOrigins, CORS or with callback URL from Google. Or is this supposed to work like this and I need to fetch for user information after he signs using Google ?
(The signIn from Google pops the popup as expected and if I click the account it seems to work fine, but doesnt contain the cookie header, I dont know why)
Client code
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
baseURL: API_BASE_URL,
plugins: [
expoClient({
scheme: "shop",
storagePrefix: "shop_auth_",
storage: SectureStore,
}),
],
});
const loginWithGoogle = async () => {
await authClient.signIn.social(
{
provider: "google",
callbackURL: "/",
},
{
onSuccess: () => {
setIsLoggedIn(true);
router.replace("/(tabs)");
},
}
);
};
BE code
export const auth = betterAuth({
database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
provider: "pg",
schema: {
user,
account,
session,
verification,
},
}),
emailAndPassword: {
enabled: true,
requireEmailVerification: true,
},
socialProviders: {
google: {
enabled: true,
clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
prompt: "select_account",
},
},
plugins: [openAPI(), expo()],
secret: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET,
trustedOrigins: [process.env.TRUSTED_ORIGIN as string],
});
