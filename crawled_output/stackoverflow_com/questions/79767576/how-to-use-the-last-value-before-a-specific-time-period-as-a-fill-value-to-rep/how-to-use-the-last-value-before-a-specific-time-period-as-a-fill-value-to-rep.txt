How to use the last value before a specific `time` period as a fill value to replace nulls in query results of Apache IoTDB?

According to the official documentation, I found that fill(previous) can be used for forward interpolation, but it doesn't work when I try to use it in Apache IoTDB 1.3.4. Here is an Example:
I first queried the last data point before a specific timestamp using the following SQL:
select FQ_03_3GREO12MY_AVALUE from `root.CNNP.ds` where `time` \<= 1755130215000 order by `time` desc limit 1
Result
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------+\
| `Time` | `root.CNNP.ds.FQ_03_3GRE012MY_AVALUE`|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------+\
|2025-08-14T08:10:14.003+08:00| 1072.0|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------+
Then I used last_value with group by and tried to fill null values with forward interpolation (fill(previous)). However, the result only returns null instead of filling with 1072.0:
select `last_value`(FQ_03_3GRE012MY_AVALUE) from `root.CNNP.ds` `group by`([1755130215000,1755130218000),1000ms) fill(previous)
Result
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+\
| `Time` | `last_value`(`root.CNNP.ds.FQ_03_3GRE012MY_AVALUE`)|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+\
|2025-08-14T08:10:15.000+08:00| `null`|\
|2025-08-14T08:10:16.000+08:00| `null`|\
|2025-08-14T08:10:17.000+08:00| `null`|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
My expected result is like this:
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+\
| `Time` | `last_value`(`root.CNNP.ds.FQ_03_3GRE012MY_AVALUE`)|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+\
|2025-08-14T08:10:15.000+08:00| 1072.0|\
|2025-08-14T08:10:16.000+08:00| 1072.0|\
|2025-08-14T08:10:17.000+08:00| 1072.0|\
+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
Shouldn't the fill(previous) strategy use the last known value (1072.0) to fill null values in the time range?
Does anyone know how to adjust the query?
