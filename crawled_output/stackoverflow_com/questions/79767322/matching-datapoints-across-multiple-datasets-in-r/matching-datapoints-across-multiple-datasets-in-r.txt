I'm doing a case study on voting in a country that has historically low literacy until recently, as such they used symbols instead of names on ballots to encourage universal voting. Whilst this is good, they did not write down what symbols mean what parties, this is doubly problematic, because often there are one or two different districts where a symbol that meant something in one district means a different party in another. As such, my solution was to create a second dataset where I recorded what parties ran under what symbols, but now I need to make sure the vote counts go to the right parties and not just the correct symbol, as such, I have datasets like this:
Dataset one:
district
umbrella
elephant
bicycle
district1
25678
21324
district2
514213
2145341
district3
543634
324245
3523542
district4
12344
324324
Dataset two:
district
umbrella
elephant
bicycle
district1
United Party
National Party
district2
National Party
Binface Party
district3
Monster Raving Loony Party
Green Party
Binface Party
district4
United Party
Pirate Party
I'm curious if there is a way to make sure that I can create a combined dataset that matches the correct votes to the correct party, given that the symbols are the column headers.

Maybe long format data would make it easier? The 1st dataset would have columns district, party_symbol, n_votes and 2nd dataset would have columns district, party_symbol, party_name. Then you can join both datasets on district and party_symbol:
library(tidyverse)
dataset_1_long <- dataset_1 %>%
pivot_longer(cols = -district, names_to = "party_symbol", values_to = "n_votes")
dataset_2_long <- dataset_1 %>%
pivot_longer(cols = -district, names_to = "party_symbol", values_to = "party_name")
dataset_1_long %>%
left_join(dataset_2_long, by = c("district", "party_symbol"))

Would I have to do anything to have it skip NAs, as not every party nor every symbol was used in every district? 2025-09-17T14:49:45.597Z+00:00

It might make sense to add a ’values_drop_na = TRUE’ to the pivot_longer’s since we want to disregard those missing observations. 2025-09-17T15:34:03.873Z+00:00
