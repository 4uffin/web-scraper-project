I am currently using DesignSurface to create a custom designer. I want to enable dragging the column widths of a DataGridView on the designer page and record the changes, similar to how it works at runtime. How can I achieve this?
I used IDesignerHost to create a root component for the designer. I created the DataGridView using the approach:
IComponent newComp = host.CreateComponent(typeof(TControl));
Now I want to enable dragging column widths on the designer page.

Enable the AllowUserToResizeColumns property. Normally, to allow resizing columns in a DataGridView by dragging, you need to set:
dataGridView.AllowUserToResizeColumns = true;
This property must also be enabled when working inside the designer, otherwise the user will not be able to drag and resize the columns on the design surface
