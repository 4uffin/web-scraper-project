I have an application (Ionic) that loads files into a Webview.
One of those files is empty, why is is empty is another thing I am looking into, however my issue is. as it is imported by another JS file, it causes a 404
So, I am trying to find out if the file is there, and the Webview is not loading an empty file, or, if the file is actually missing.
I have checked that is IS in the apk file, but I cannot be 100% sure it is installed onto the system (perhaps it is skipped because it is empty).
My question here, is I cannot find where the file are installed (on the emulator).
Some people sate under data/app,
but all I see here is
Under data/data I find the app, but it just seems to be data files, not the actual installed files.
I can understand perhaps a real device would hide these, however I would expect on the emulator, where we run for purposes of debugging we could some how see them?

Installing the app doesn't just unzip it into Android's filesystem.
Asset files remain in the APK, they don't get stored on the filesystem

Oh, that is interesting. Looks like I won't able to check on this. I am now removing the empty file before building the package,m so this has solved my immediate problem.
