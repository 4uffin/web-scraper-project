Just to be clear, I have a pretty good handle on how double quotes and single backticks are used in bash shell scripts.
But I'm trying to puzzle through someone else's script.
He makes alot of use of double backticks.
I've never seen this before.
Can anyone tell me what they do in bash?

Double backticks aren't really a thing in bash. Is this in a script that gets run directly by bash, or is it in something else (like a workflow automation system) that preprocesses it before handing it to bash?

You can't control what other people do but you should avoid backticks in favor of $() in your own scripts.

Without seeing the code, my best guess is that these double backticks would just do nothing. They'd literally act like no-ops. This based off of trying echo ``echo bar``.
