Specifying intercept/offset with nls (fitting logistic curve) in R [duplicate]
When estimating a linear model with R, one can force a y-intercept by using the offset argument, e.g.
my_linear_model = lm(y ~ 0 + x, offset=rep(my_intercept, length(x))
I'm trying to fit my data to ...

How can I set an OFFSET = 100 in nls (Nonlinear Least Squares) coupled with the SSbiexp or SSasympOFF (self-starting) functions in R?
I am using self-starting functions to estimate the best constants for my models in R software. But it does not allow me to constrain my offset (y=100, x=0) to be 100.
The two component exponential ...
