React dropzone drag'n'drop weird behavior

I'm trying to use the react-dropzone lib in my application. It's working perfectly with click to select file. But the drag'n drop doesn't work at all. Even the style, with the isDragActive.
Do you have any idea that could explain why ? My code is the same as the example given by the dev
import {useCallback} from 'react'
import {useDropzone} from 'react-dropzone'
export function UploadDropzone() {
const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: any) => {
// Do something with the files
console.log(acceptedFiles)
}, [])
const {getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive} = useDropzone({onDrop})
return (
<div {...getRootProps()}>
<input {...getInputProps()} />
{
isDragActive ?
<p>Drop the files here ...</p> :
<p>Drag 'n' drop some files here, or click to select files</p>
}
</div>
)
}
