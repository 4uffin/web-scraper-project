this is method where a new icon is being inserted into pdf using rectangle cordinates. But it creates two icons one with clickable to download the document and other just an image.
private boolean attachExcelSheet1(Order order, PdfDocument pdfDocument, PdfPage pdfPage, ByteArrayOutputStream excelFile, String detailLink) {
int y = order.getMajorVersion().getValue() > 0 ? 283 : 330;
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(574, 204, 5, 5);
byte[] embeddedFileContentBytes = excelFile.toByteArray();
String fileName = detailLink + order.getOrderRevision() + ".xlsx";
PdfFileSpec fs = PdfFileSpec.createEmbeddedFileSpec(pdfDocument, embeddedFileContentBytes, null, fileName, null, null);
PdfAnnotation attachment = new PdfFileAttachmentAnnotation(rect, fs)
.setContents(String.format("%s %s", detailLink, order.getOrderRevision()));
pdfPage.addAnnotation(attachment);
return true;
}

This is a common issue when using PdfFileAttachmentAnnotation from iText7. The duplicate icons occur because iText7 can create both a visual representation and the actual clickable annotation. Here's how to fix it:
private boolean attachExcelSheet1(Order order, PdfDocument pdfDocument, PdfPage pdfPage, ByteArrayOutputStream excelFile, String detailLink) {
int y = order.getMajorVersion().getValue() > 0 ? 283 : 330;
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(574, 204, 20, 20);
byte[] embeddedFileContentBytes = excelFile.toByteArray();
String fileName = detailLink + order.getOrderRevision() + ".xlsx";
PdfFileSpec fs = PdfFileSpec.createEmbeddedFileSpec(
pdfDocument,
embeddedFileContentBytes,
null,
fileName,
PdfName.ApplicationVndOpenxmlformatsOfficedocumentSpreadsheetmlSheet,
null
);
PdfFileAttachmentAnnotation attachment = new PdfFileAttachmentAnnotation(rect, fs)
.setContents(String.format("%s %s", detailLink, order.getOrderRevision()))
.setName(PdfName.Paperclip)
.setIconName(PdfName.Paperclip);
attachment.getPdfObject().remove(PdfName.AP);
attachment.setFlag(PdfAnnotation.PRINT);
attachment.setFlag(PdfAnnotation.NO_ZOOM);
pdfPage.addAnnotation(attachment);
return true;
}
Larger Rectangle: Changed from 5x5 to 20x20 for better visibility and proper rendering
Explicit Icon Setting: Added .setName() and .setIconName() to avoid default behavior
Remove Appearance Dictionary: attachment.getPdfObject().remove(PdfName.AP) prevents visual conflicts
Annotation Flags: Added PRINT and NO_ZOOM flags for consistent behavior
MIME Type: Added proper MIME type for Excel files

"Remove Appearance Dictionary" - Beware, if you are creating a PDF 2.0 document, annotation appearances are required. 2025-09-18T07:22:47.153Z+00:00
