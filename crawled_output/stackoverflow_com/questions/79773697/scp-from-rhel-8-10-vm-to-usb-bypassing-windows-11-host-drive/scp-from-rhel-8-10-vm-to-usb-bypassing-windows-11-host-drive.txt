I am attempting to find information showing that when you SCP a file from a RHEL 8.10 VM hosted on Windows 11 to a USB drive, the contents of the file are not stored in a page file or buffer file somewhere on the windows 11 machine host machine. This setup is using Hyper-V with an "Internal" switch set up for the VM to access the NIC.
Basically can you bypass/not touch the Windows 11 HD by SCP direct to the USB drive.
Thank you!
