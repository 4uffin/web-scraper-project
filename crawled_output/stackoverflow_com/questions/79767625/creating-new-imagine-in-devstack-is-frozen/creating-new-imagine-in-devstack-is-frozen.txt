I installed DevStack and I am trying to create a new image.
I am using Ubuntu alpine ISO for the new image.
But the process is frozen on “Queued” for hours.
In syslog I can only see this log repeating:
[email protected][1962]: #033[00;32mDEBUG futurist.periodics [#033[00;36m-#033[00;32m] #033[01;35m#033[00;32mSubmitting periodic callback 'neutron.plugins.ml2.drivers.ovn.mech_driver.ovsdb.maintenance.HashRingHealthCheckPeriodics.touch_hash_ring_node'#033[00m #033[00;33m{{(pid=1962) _process_scheduled /opt/stack/data/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/futurist/periodics.py:638}}#033[00m#033[00m
I am new in DevStack so it’s possible I am missing some settings.
