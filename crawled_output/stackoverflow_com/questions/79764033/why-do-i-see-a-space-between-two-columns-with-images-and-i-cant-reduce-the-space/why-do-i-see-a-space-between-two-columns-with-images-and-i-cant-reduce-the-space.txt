Why do I see a space between two columns with images and I can't reduce the space between columns?

I want my 6 images to be in two columns and 3 images in one column and 3 images in another column, but when I order them by columns there is a space between the two columns and when you move them, the space gets bigger. I am a beginner and I'm building my portfolio and I encounter this problem.
First I wrote the img inside of the container
Then, I used grid and grid-template-columns to define two columns with three images each. I assigned them size and height and used the block to remove the extra space between the images.
I've tried reducing the width, but it only reduces the size of the images. What I want is for the two columns to be next to each other on the right side.
I'm not uploading an image because last time I was denied due to an image, but I hope you understand my problem.
.skill-pictures {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 3fr);
gap: 10px;
justify-content: center;
border: 1px solid grey;
}
.skill-pictures img {
width: 150px;
height: auto;
display: block;
margin-left: 70%;
border: 1px solid black;
}
<div class="skill-pictures">
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/HTML.png" alt="HTML" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/CSS.png" alt="CSS" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/JavaScript.png" alt="JS" />
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/Github.png" alt="GH" />

<img src="Imagenes-Skills/PowerBi.png" alt="PowerBi" />
</div>

Using margin-left: 70% on the images causes each image to shift to the right within its own column. Since there are two columns, the second column also moves to the right by the same amount, which increases the space between the columns. Instead of applying margin-left to the images, it's better to align the entire container to the right using justify-content: end or justify-content: flex-end, and leave the images without any specific margin.

Using margin-left: 70% on the images causes each image to shift to the right within its own column, as opposed to shifting the whole grid. Since there are two columns, the second column also moves to the right by the same amount, which increases the space between the columns. Instead of applying margin-left to the images or the container, it's better to align the entire container to the right using justify-content: end or justify-content: flex-end, and leave the images without any specific margin.
Changes made:
Replace 3fr with the images' actual width (150px) on line 3
Set justify-content to end to align the grid/container to the right
Since justify-content is already being used to align the grid to the right, the margin can be set back to 0 to remove the spacing between grid columns
.skill-pictures {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 150px);
gap: 10px;
justify-content: end;
border: 1px solid grey;
}
.skill-pictures img {
width: 150px;
height: auto;
display: block;
margin: 0;
border: 1px solid black;
}
<div class="skill-pictures">
<img src="Imagenes-Skills/HTML.png" alt="HTML" />

Please don’t present “answers” in the form of a game of spot-the-difference. Explain how to solve the problem using English. 2025-09-14T05:31:27.853Z+00:00

You're right. I shouldn't have put the explanation in a comment, I should have included it directly in the answer. Also, my response might not be exactly what the user needs, since I'm not familiar with his project, and he might have to make a lot of changes to get it to work (thanks, won't happen again) 2025-09-14T06:08:13.92Z+00:00

To expand on @Quentin’s point, this is especially true when the OP is asking a “why?” question. They are expecting an explanation. 2025-09-14T05:42:59.723Z+00:00
