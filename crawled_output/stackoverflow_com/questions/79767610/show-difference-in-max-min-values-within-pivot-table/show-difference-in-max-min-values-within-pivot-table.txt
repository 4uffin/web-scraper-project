I am trying to add a column in a Pivot Table, that shows the difference between the max and min values within a row/field.
Sample Data:
Name
State
Value

And my simple pivot table is below.
For each Name, I'm trying to calculate the difference in the largest and smallest value per the "State" rows.
I've added a manual column, "Largest Distance" to show what I'd like to return.
Where there's a single value, return 0 since there's no max/min.
Otherwise, max(Value)-min(value) is what I'm looking for.
The "Avg Value" column is a calculated field where the formula is =max(Value)-min(Value), but it shows 0 for everything, even when I change to show the SUM, or Average, or Count, etc.
(The 7 is from 9-2)

You'll need the data model. Do you have Power Pivot in your version of Excel?

@Rory - I do! And I can add the data to a model for sure.
How can I do the max-min thing with that?

Load your data into the data model. (I'll assume a table called Table1)
Create a measure for the average called Avg Value using:
=AVERAGE(Table1[Value])
Create another measure for the difference value you want using something like:
=IF(ISFILTERED(Table1[State]),
BLANK(),
VAR __stateVals = ADDCOLUMNS(SUMMARIZE(ALLEXCEPT(Table1,Table1[Name]),Table1[State]),"AvgVal",[Avg Value])
RETURN MAXX(__stateVals,[AvgVal])-MINX(__stateVals,[AvgVal]))
which should give you this:

Wow! This is excellent and works great.
Now, and this may warrant a second question, is it possible to make dynamic?
Say I want to switch "State"
out with "City".
Would I have to write a new measure for that, or is there some way to do this dynamically and use the "last row" in the Pivot Table fields to determine the value difference? 2025-09-18T19:54:46.42Z+00:00

Not in Power Pivot, as far as I am aware. Might work in Power BI with visual calculations, but there is no equivalent to that in PP. Your measures have to be specific to the layout in question so that you can override just the relevant field filters. 2025-09-18T22:56:03.953Z+00:00
