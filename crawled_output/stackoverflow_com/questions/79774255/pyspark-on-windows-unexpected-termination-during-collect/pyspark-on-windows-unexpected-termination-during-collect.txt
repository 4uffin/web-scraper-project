I am new to python and pyspark.
I'm trying to run it on Windows Server 2022.
I have environment variables
HADOOP_HOME=C:\spark\hadoop
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot
SPARK_HOME=C:\spark\spark-4.0.1-bin-hadoop3
PYSPARK_PYTHON=C:\Program Files\Python312\python.exe
I have %JAVA_HOME%\bin;%HADOOP_HOME%\bin;%SPARK_HOME%\bin in my search PATH.
I have this source file:
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("UnitTest").master("local[*]").getOrCreate()
df = spark.createDataFrame(
[["One"]],
["First"]
)
df.collect()
When I run it, I get:
F:\VSTS>python c:\temp\repro.py
The system cannot find the path specified.
