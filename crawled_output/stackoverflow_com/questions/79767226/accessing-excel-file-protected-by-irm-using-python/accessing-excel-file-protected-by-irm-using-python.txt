how to read password protected excel in python
How to open write reserved excel file in python with win32com?
I'm trying to open a password protected file in excel without any user interaction.
I searched online, and found this code which uses win32com.client
When I run this, I still get the prompt to enter the password...
from xlrd import *
import win32com.client
import csv
import sys
xlApp = win32com.client.Dispatch("Excel.Application")
print "Excel library version:", xlApp.Version
filename,password = r"\\HRA\Myfile.xlsx", 'caa team'
xlwb = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(filename, Password=password)

I recently discovered a Python library that makes this task simple.
It does not require Excel to be installed and, because it's pure Python, it's cross-platform too!
msoffcrypto-tool supports password-protected (encrypted) Microsoft Office documents, including the older XLS binary file format.
Install msoffcrypto-tool:
pip install msoffcrypto-tool
You could create an unencrypted version of the workbook from the command line:
msoffcrypto-tool Myfile.xlsx Myfile-decrypted.xlsx -p "caa team"
Or, you could use msoffcrypto-tool as a library. While you could write an unencrypted version to disk like above, you may prefer to create an decrypted in-memory file and pass this to your Python Excel library (openpyxl, xlrd, etc.).
import io
import msoffcrypto
import openpyxl
decrypted_workbook = io.BytesIO()
with open('Myfile.xlsx', 'rb') as file:
office_file = msoffcrypto.OfficeFile(file)
office_file.load_key(password='caa team')
office_file.decrypt(decrypted_workbook)
# `filename` can also be a file-like object.
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(filename=decrypted_workbook)

I cannot upvote this solution enough. Unlike various other solutions (such as using xlwings), this method allows you to read the decrypted data with the library you're already using, e.g. pandas.read_excel(decrypted_workbook) or openpyxl.load_workbook(decrypted_workbook) 2022-03-12T00:25:22.63Z+00:00

I don't think that named parameters work in this case. So you'd have to do something like:
xlwb = xlApp.Workbooks.Open(filename, False, True, None, password)
See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff194819.aspx for details on the Workbooks.Open method.

If your file size is small, you can probably save that as ".csv".
and then read
It worked for me :)

Openpyxl Package works if you are using linux system. You can use secure the file by setting up a password and open the file using the same password.

No, this doesn't work. I looked and found that Openpyxl cannot open a password-protected Excel. 2022-01-03T19:54:53.233Z+00:00

This link doesn't point to a specific answer but to the Quora question itself and there are a bunch of guesses (and ignorant non-answers) there. There may have been only a single answer when you added the link but this is definitely not the case anymore. 2024-05-16T08:58:22.157Z+00:00

Thank you so much for the great answers on this topic. Trying to collate all of it. My requirement was to open a bunch of password protected excel files ( all had same password ) so that I could do some more processing on those. Please find the code below.
import pandas as pd
import os
from xlrd import *
import win32com.client as w3c
import csv
import sys
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile
df_list=[]
#
print(len(files))
for f in files:
#
print(f)
if('.xlsx' in f):
xlwb = xlapp.Workbooks.Open('C:\\users\\files\\'+f, False, True, None, 'password')
temp_f = NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.csv')
temp_f.close()
os.unlink(temp_f.name)
xlwb.SaveAs(Filename=temp_f.name, FileFormat=xlCSVWindows)
df = pd.read_csv(temp_f.name,encoding='Latin-1')
# Read that CSV from Pandas
df.to_excel('C:\\users\\files\\password_removed\\'+f)
