I have 3 related goals/questions:
I want to have the language of a User available in the whole app. ABP does not offer the information within their "CurrentUser" class. So I take it from the DB manually and would like to save it somewhere, so that I can just access it anywhere.
Is there a better way than setting the System.Globalization.CultureInfo?
Why does ABP always interpret numbers the english way (point is a decimal operator? This should come from some CultureInfo, but the only one I can find ("System.Globalization.CultureInfo") is set to German in my case. So how can I access and set the ABP Culture?
Is there a built-in mechanism that stores user-culture-info somehow and makes it available again?

Not familiar with ABP, but they do have an article regarding languages at: abp.io/docs/latest/modules/language-management

I know that they ahve a horrible documentation that is almost as useless as the one from MS. But how can this get downvoted??? Only because nobody knows ABP?
