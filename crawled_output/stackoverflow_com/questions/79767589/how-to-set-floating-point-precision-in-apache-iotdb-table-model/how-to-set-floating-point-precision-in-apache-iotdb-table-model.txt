How to Set Floating-Point Precision in Apache IoTDB Table Model?

In Apache IoTDB 2.0.4's tree model, for sequences of FLOAT or DOUBLE type, if the encoding method uses RLE or TS_2DIFF, the number of decimal places for floating-point numbers can be specified by the MAX_POINT_NUMBER attribute when creating the sequence. For example:
CREATE TIMESERIES `root.vehicle.d0.s0` WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE, '`MAX_POINT_NUMBER`'='2';
Following this approach, I attempted to set the precision when creating a table in the table model, using the following statement:
CREATE TABLE vehicle(
dn STRING TAG,
sn FLOAT FIELD '`MAX_POINT_NUMBER`'='2'
) WITH (TTL=DEFAULT);
However, the execution failed with an error indicating that MAX_POINT_NUMBER is not supported.
Error message:
Msg: org.apache.iotdb.jdbc.IoTDBSQLException: 700: line 1:54: mismatched input ''`MAX_POINT_NUMBER`''. Expecting: ')', ','
Additionally, the official documentation states that for columns in a table, only adding and deleting columns are supported, but not modifying them.
So, how can I set floating-point precision in the table model using SQL?
