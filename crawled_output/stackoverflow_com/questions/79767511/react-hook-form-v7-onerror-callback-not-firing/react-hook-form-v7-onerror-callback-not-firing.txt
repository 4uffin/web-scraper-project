I’m using React Hook Form v7 with handleSubmit(onSubmit, onError).
Here’s my form component:
function CreateCabinForm() {
const { register, handleSubmit, reset } = useForm();
function onSubmit(data) {
console.log("Submitted data:", data);
}
function onError(errors) {
console.log("Validation errors:", errors);
}
return (
<Form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit, onError)}>
<Input
type="text"
id="name"
{...register("name", { required: "This field is required" })}
/>
<Button size="medium" variation="primary">
Add cabin
</Button>
</Form>
);
}
The issue:
When I submit the form with empty required fields, the onError function never runs, so nothing shows in the console.
Submitting with missing inputs should trigger onError and log the validation errors.

Looks like it works here. codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/register-forked-x4s455
I noticed: You are using Form, Input etc instead of form, input. Are they custom components? THen their implementation might have something to do with this
