Can't add custom front matter defaults to Jekyll page generated by a plugin

I have a ruby script in _plugins which generates pages that list posts in a collection tagged with a particular tag. It is a slightly modified version of the code available here.
In _config.yml I can successfully add default front matter for permalink and layout, but my custom front matter doesn't seem to be applied. (The custom front matter is just telling the page to load a mathjax script).
The front matter is specified in _config.yml as below:
defaults:
-
scope:
path: ""
type: "tagpages"
values:
permalink: "/:collection/tags/:title"
layout: "tagpage"
libs:
- "mathjax"
# I have tried this with and without quotation marks
Like I said, permalink and layout are applied correctly and without issue.
I've used console.log("{{ page.libs }}") which outputs an empty string on these pages, but not on other pages that use this front matter. Because of this, I assumed the front matter is not being applied. However, I noticed that console.log("{{ page.layout }}") and console.log("{{ page.permalink }}") also output empty strings on these pages, even though they are clearly being applied. I don't know if there is a way to see the generated pages before they are converted to html to see if the front matter is indeed there or not?
