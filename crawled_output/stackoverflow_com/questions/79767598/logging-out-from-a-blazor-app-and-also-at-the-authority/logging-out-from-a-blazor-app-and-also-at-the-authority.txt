I've got a Blazor app set up with an external oidc authority
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
options.DefaultScheme = "Cookies";
options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = "Cookies";
options.DefaultChallengeScheme = "oidc";
})
.AddCookie(options =>
{
options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Lax;
options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
options.AccessDeniedPath = "/AccessDenied";
})
.AddOpenIdConnect("oidc", options =>
{
options.Authority = jwtBearerOptions.Authority;
options.ClientId = jwtBearerOptions.ClientId;
options.ClientSecret = jwtBearerOptions.ClientSecret;
options.ResponseType = "code";
options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = false;
options.Scope.Add("openid");
options.Scope.Add("profile");
options.Scope.Add("offline_access");
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
options.CallbackPath = "/signin-oidc";
options.SignedOutCallbackPath = "/signout-callback-oidc";
options.SignInScheme = "Cookies";
})
I can log in fine, but I can't log out.
This is my code to log out
await HttpContext.SignOutAsync("Cookies");
await HttpContext.SignOutAsync("oidc", new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/");
I expect it to redirect to the authority and log out there and then return to /signout-callback-oidc but nothing happens.
How do I get it to trigger the logout?

Hmm - your code looks alright. I have some code that works on .NET 8, which looks like this. I can run the web app on HTTP for development or HTTPS.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
}
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
JwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();
services.AddAuthentication(options => {
options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options => {
options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.SameAsRequest;
})
.AddOpenIdConnect(options => {
options.SignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
options.CorrelationCookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
options.CorrelationCookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.SameAsRequest;
options.NonceCookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
options.NonceCookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.SameAsRequest;
options.Authority = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIdConnect:Issuer");
options.ClientId = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIdConnect:ClientId");
options.ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIdConnect:ClientSecret");
options.CallbackPath = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIdConnect:CallbackPath");
options.ResponseType = OpenIdConnectResponseType.Code;
options.ResponseMode = OpenIdConnectResponseMode.Query;
string scopeString = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIDConnect:Scope");
options.Scope.Clear();
scopeString.Split(" ", StringSplitOptions.TrimEntries).ToList().ForEach(scope => {
options.Scope.Add(scope);
});
options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
{
ValidIssuer = options.Authority,
ValidAudience = options.ClientId
};
options.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;
options.Events.OnRedirectToIdentityProviderForSignOut = (context) =>
{
context.ProtocolMessage.PostLogoutRedirectUri = Configuration.GetValue<string>("OpenIdConnect:PostLogoutRedirectUri");
return Task.CompletedTask;
};
options.SaveTokens = true;
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
});
services.AddAuthorization();
}
And then logout code looks the same as yours:
public async Task OnPostLogout()
{
await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
See if the above code works for you. If not, then let me know your environment and I will recheck the above code, e.g. on a newer .NET version.
