Modifying macOS (Sonoma 14.6) Cursor in SwiftUI Not Working Reliably

Since the .pointerStyle(.link) modifier is not available until macOS 15, and I need to support macOS 14.6, I created my own modifier to simulate the same behavior. There are three problems I am facing:
When hovering over the view, the mouse cursor does not update until I interact with the view (i.e., I click on it)
It should be noted that when I put print(_:) statements in my modifier, I can see the code is being executed
Clicking on the view causes the mouse cursor to get reset (because the hover is lost), but not necessarily after the first click
The onTapGesture(perform:) in the modifier blocks any onTapGestures(perform:) I may need to apply outside of the modifier; using simultaneousGesture(_:) does solve the problem, but requires that I put the pointer(_:) modifier after my onTapGesture(perform:)
I am unable to upload an animated gif demonstrating the problem, so here it is on Imgur: https://imgur.com/a/5me84Kl
Here is the code for the PointerModifier:
import SwiftUI
struct PointerModifier: ViewModifier {
var pointer: NSCursor
func body(content: Content) -> some View {
content
.onTapGesture {
DispatchQueue.main.async {
let _ = print("TapGesture: Pushing new mouse cursor")
pointer.push()
}
}
// Or
//
.simultaneousGesture(TapGesture().onEnded({
//
DispatchQueue.main.async {
//
let _ = print("TapGesture: Pushing new mouse cursor")
//
pointer.push()
//
}
//
}))
.onHover { hover in
DispatchQueue.main.async {
if hover {
let _ = print("Hover: Pushing new mouse cursor")
pointer.push()
} else {
let _ = print("Hover: Popping mouse cursor")
NSCursor.pop()
}
}
}
}
}
extension View {
func pointer(_ pointer: NSCursor) -> some View {
modifier(PointerModifier(pointer: pointer))
}
}

.onHover is called only when the pointer enters or leaves the view bounds.
You could try using onContinuousHover that "Adds an action to perform when the pointer enters, moves within, and exits the view’s bounds."
