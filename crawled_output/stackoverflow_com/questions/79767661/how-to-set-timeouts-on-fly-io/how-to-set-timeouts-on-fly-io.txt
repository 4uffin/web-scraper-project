It seems that the machine is deinitializing soon after it initializes, because I can't access the site. It seems to have stopped the work after I set [[services.tcp_checks]].
I meant by these settings that my app starts a few seconds before exposing a port. But it seems, I did something wrong. What are correct settings?
