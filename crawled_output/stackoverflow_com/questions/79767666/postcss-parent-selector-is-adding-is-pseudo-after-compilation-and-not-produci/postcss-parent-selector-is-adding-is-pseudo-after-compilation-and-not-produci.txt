PostCSS parent Selector is adding :is() pseudo after compilation and not producing compatible css

I have just migrated from SCSS to PostCSS and encountered only one issue I cannot resolve.
The issue concerns how to alter a the styles of a nested element when its parent has a specific class.
The following is a simplified representation of the problem. Real use cases are much more nested than this which is why the function had merit when using SASS.
Input
.nav {
position: relative;
height: 50px;
& .nav-backdrop {
height: 100%
background-color: green;
.nav:not(.is-open) & {
background-color: red;
}
}
}
Expected result:
.nav {
position: relative;
height: 50px;
}
.nav .nav-backdrop {
height: 100%;
background-color: green;
}
.nav:not(.is-open) .nav-backdrop {
background-color: red;
}
Actual result:
.nav {
position: relative;
height: 50px;
}
.nav .nav-backdrop {
height: 100%;
background-color: green;
}
.nav:not(.is-open) :is(.nav .nav-backdrop) {
background-color: red;
}
The use of the pseudo :is() is not supposed to be the intense output to support the compatible browsers and I cannot see why it is outputting in this way.
In SASS I used a custom mixin and function called parent-append to have complete control over how nested I wanted to go. Ideally I would like to try and replicate the same but I cannot even get this basic representation to work.
I also tried to make use of postcss-nested-ancestors but that did not change anything.
The error I receive is can not be transformed to an equivalent selector without ':is()
Is there a way to achieve what I am trying to do.
Plugins included:
{
"postcss-calc": "^10.1.1",
"postcss-combine-media-query": "^2.0.0",
"postcss-nested-ancestors": "^3.0.0",
"postcss-preset-env": "^10.3.1",
"postcss-simple-vars": "^7.0.1"
}

@TemaniAfif Is there anyway to get the result I'd actually like?

You have to rethink your selectors or keep using Sass. You cannot really change the behavior of CSS

@TemaniAfif I'm starting to realise that. I've made some workarounds to make life simpler as I will stick with PostCSS.
