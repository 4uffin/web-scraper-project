When I try to build docker image I get error:
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: openjdk:21-slim-buster: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/openjdk:21-slim-buster: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/openjdk/manifests/21-slim-buster: 401 Unauthorized
Do you know how I can fix this? This image should be public?

Debian Buster has been moved to Debian Archive. Use another distribution or edit your apt to use archive repositories.

This error can happen when Docker Hub is experiencing an incident, I recommend to check dockerstatus.com before investigating further.
At the time this question was asked, there was indeed an incident at Docker:
