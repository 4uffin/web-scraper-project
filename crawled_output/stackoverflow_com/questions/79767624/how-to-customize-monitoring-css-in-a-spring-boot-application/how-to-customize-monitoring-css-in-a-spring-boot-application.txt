How to customize Monitoring CSS in a Spring Boot application?

I checked the advanced documentation, and I saw the section that shows how to configure web.xml and use customMonitoring.css. However, in a Spring Boot application, we usually don’t have a web.xml.
Is there a recommended way to customize the monitoring page CSS in a Spring Boot setup without having to replace files inside the JavaMelody JAR package?
I tried creating a configuration bean for JavaMelody and attempted to replicate the XML setup in code, but that didn’t work. And also checked if there was an param for using at the properties files but found nothing.

Have you taken a look at Java Melody's SpringBootStarter? It apparently "facilitates the integration of JavaMelody in Spring Boot web applications". Never used it, so no idea if this is relevant to your situation, or not.
