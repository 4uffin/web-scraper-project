I'm developing an addon for this project: https://jcm.joban.org/latest/dev/scripting/pids/ (It uses a version of javascript to create screens in-game. In the scripts, most code is run in a function that is called every frame. Within this function, I want to make a text object that flashes. Ideally, I want a solution that doesn't change the flash interval based on the framerate, but setInterval() and setTimeout() aren't available in the mod's implementation of JS. What other ways should I try to make text flash within this function?

Please provide enough code in the post itself, external links can be changed over time and will invalidate your question.

"Questions seeking debugging help ("why isn't this code working?") must include the desired behavior, a specific problem or error and the shortest code necessary to reproduce it in the question itself". See: What topics can I ask about here?, How to Ask and How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example. You can edit your question. Thanks.
