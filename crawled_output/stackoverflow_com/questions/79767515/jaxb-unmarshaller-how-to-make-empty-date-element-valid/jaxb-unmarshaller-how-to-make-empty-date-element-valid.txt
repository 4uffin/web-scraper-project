JAXB unmarshaller - how to make empty date element valid?

Say I have for example this XML
<Account>
<AccountValidTo/>
</Account>
where AccountValidTo is defined in XSD as xs:dateTime. I have Java classes generated from the XSD using jaxb2-maven-plugin.
JAXB unmarshaller (org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller) fails on this XML (IllegalArgumentException in Java), because empty value cannot be parsed as a date. I understand that. The obvious solution is to leave out the element entirely. However, these XMLs are coming from 3rd party so I have no control over what they send. Yes, they should comply to the specification and produce/send valid XMLs, however, persuading them to do this is a long shot, so I would prefer to have a solution on my side.
Is it somehow possible to tell the unmarshaller to skip xs:dateTime elements if they are empty? (I would prefer XSD-only solution if one exists - e.g. the field in question in the generated class would have some annotation that would tell the unmarshaller to do what I need. Adding the annotation there manaully is not really an option, since the class is generated. Or maybe org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller supports this by configuration or some code extension.)

Try adding nillable=true to the element definition in the xsd.

might depend on the version, but @XmlJavaTypeAdapter might help.

@LMC I'm pretty sure that would mean just that null is valid from xsd point of view, but still would fail during unmarsahalling (doesn't hurt to try that though, thanks for the suggestion)

@AndrewS I've already encountered this, but the issue with it is, like I mention in my question, I cannot really touch the classes themselves, because they are generated (from the xsd). Thanks anyway, I can at least try this just to see where it takes me, but ultimately I cannot use it.

Could you share actual configuration for this ?
