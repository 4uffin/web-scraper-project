How to configure ACLs with SASL_SSL OAUTHBEARER in Apache Kafka (KRaft mode, multi-node setup)?

I am trying to secure an Apache Kafka cluster running in KRaft mode using SASL_SSL with OAUTHBEARER authentication and enforce ACLs.
I have a multi-node setup - controller and broker run on different ec2 instances.
Despite multiple configuration attempts, I am either getting token retrieval errors or ACLs do not enforce authentication correctly.
Environment
Kafka version: 3.8.1
Deployment: Multi-node (Controller and Broker on separate EC2 instances)
OS / Environment: Amazon Linux
Steps Taken & Scenarios
To troubleshoot, I tried progressively different configurations to isolate where the issue lies.
Here are the four scenarios I tested and the results I observed:
Scenario 1: Controller & Broker both use SASL_SSL OAUTHBEARER
Result: Controller fails to start
Error: An internal error occurred while retrieving token from callback handler
Scenario 2: Controller & Broker both use SASL_PLAINTEXT
Result: Cluster works fine
ACLs: Work as expected (username/password authentication)
Scenario 3: Controller uses SASL_SSL (PLAIN) & Broker uses SASL_SSL (OAUTHBEARER)
Result: Controller starts fine, but Broker shows error
Error: An internal error occurred while retrieving token from callback handler
Scenario 4: Controller uses PLAINTEXT & Broker uses SASL_SSL (OAUTHBEARER)
Result: Cluster runs successfully
Issue: ACLs do not seem to enforce authentication — all access is granted regardless of credentials
Is it possible to configure ACLs in Apache Kafka (KRaft mode, multi-node setup) with SASL_SSL OAUTHBEARER?
