I have a process that computes and checks the checksum in AIS messages, the checksum is the xor of all the bytes in the message expressed in hexadecimal format.
At the moment I am turning both the calculated and included checksums into strings and comparing them, which seems a bit compute heavy. Is there a better way to compare the single byte calculation with its 2 byte hexadecimal representation?
bytdata is the AIS message in a []byte{}.
j := i + 1
for ; j < leng ; j++ {
checkSum ^= (int)(bytdata[j])
}
checkBytes := fmt.Sprintf("%02X", checkSum)
if checkBytes == string(bytdata[(j+1):(j+3)]) {
// valid checksum......
etc
}

AIS checksum is one byte encoded as two ASCII hex character. you can parse these two and compare them directly instead of fmt.Sprintf:
import (
"encoding/hex"
)
j := i + 1
checkSum := 0
for ; j < leng; j++ {
checkSum ^= int(bytdata[j])
}
bytes := bytdata[j+1 : j+3]
msgCs, err := hex.DecodeString(string(bytes))
if err != nil || len(msgCs) != 1 {
return
}
if byte(checkSum) == msgCs[0] {}

It follows from the code in the question: fmt.Sprintf("%02X", checkSum) that the checksum is written in uppercase. Here is the fastest way to check the checksum without any string conversions:
const hexDigits = "0123456789ABCDEF"
// ...
var checkSum byte = 0
for ; j < leng; j++ {
checkSum ^= bytdata[j]
}
if hexDigits[checkSum >>
4] == bytdata[j + 1] &&
hexDigits[checkSum & 0xF] == bytdata[j + 2] {
// valid checksum......
}

Thanks for the suggestions, this also avoids any string conversions and doesn't use the hex lookup table.
dcode := make([]byte, 1)
...
checkSum = 0
for j = i+1 ; j < leng ; j++ {
checkSum ^= (int)(bytdata[j])
}
_, err := hex.Decode(dcode, bytdata[(j+1):(j+3)])
if err == nil && (int)(dcode[0]) == checkSum {
// valid checksum, will it fit in one packet
...

if err == nil && (int)(hsum[0]) == checkSum -> if err == nil && (int)(dcode[0]) == checkSum ? 2025-09-18T02:47:37.573Z+00:00
