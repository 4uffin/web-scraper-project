GLSL shader not showing anything in scene in THREE.js - why?

I'm trying to make my own shader for a THREE.js project I'm working on, and I wanted to make a GLSL shader as part of it for one of the meshes in my scene. However, despite writing very basic code for it, the mesh (just a cylinder) won't display at all in the scene. This was the relevant code I've been working with at the moment:
main.js:
import * as THREE from 'three'
const scene = new THREE.Scene()
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
80, /* FOV */
window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, /* aspect ratio */
0.1, /* closest visible distance */
1000 /* furthest visible distance */
)
camera.position.x = -0.15
camera.position.y = 0.15
camera.position.z = 0.15
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0))
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
antialias: true
})
renderer.setSize(
window.innerWidth, /* width */
window.innerHeight /* height */
)
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)
let cylinderGeometry = new THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.002, 0.002, 0.25)
let cylinderMaterial = new THREE.ShaderMaterial({
vertexShader: document.getElementById("vertexShader").textContent,
fragmentShader: document.getElementById("fragmentShader").textContent
})
let cylinderMesh = new THREE.Mesh(cylinderGeometry, cylinderMaterial)
cylinderMesh.position.y = 0.125
scene.add(cylinderMesh)
function animate() {
window.requestAnimationFrame(animate)
renderer.render(scene, camera)
}
animate()
index.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Rubik's Cube</title>
<style>
body { margin: 0; }
</style>
</head>
<body style="background-color: #dedede">
<script type="module" src="./src/main.js"></script>
<script id="vertexShader" type="x-shader/x-vertex">
void main() {
gl_Position = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 );
}
</script>
<script id="fragmentShader" type="x-shader/x-fragment">
void main() {
gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ,1.0);
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
Apologies if the answer happened to be obvious – this is my first time working with GLSL.

You neet use vertex position coming from 3js and transform it with model-view-projection matrix. Now your every vertex is placed at clip-space coords 1,1,1,1 and all vertices are set into single point, so you see nothing.
Try in vertex
void main() {
gl_Position = projectionMatrix * modelViewMatrix * vec4(position, 1.0);
}

I was experimenting with three.js shaders about 10 years ago and created a blog post that may help you.
Glancing at your code I do see that you don't seem to call the render function.
Try adding this at the end of your code:
renderer.render(scene, camera);
Edit: I just updated the blog link with the correct link. It has a few different examples of implementing different shaders, though is for an old version of three.js, but should still be relevant.
