I'm wondering if anybody can help me compile Pymesh (Pymesh2) https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh
It's a large graphics package which depends on many 3rd party libraries, notably CGL and draco, and mmg. I've managed to fix a number of build errors by downgrading to mmg 5.3.6 and cgal 4.10 I am now failing at the final hurdle: linking it all.
/usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libdraco.a(sequential_integer_attribute_encoder.cc.o): warning: relocation against _ZTVN5draco36MeshPredictionSchemeTexCoordsEncoderIiNS_37PredictionSchemeWrapEncodingTransformIiiEENS_24MeshPredictionSchemeDataINS_24MeshAttributeCornerTableEEEEE' in read-only section .text._ZN5draco36MeshPredictionSchemeTexCoordsEncoderIiNS_37PredictionSchemeWrapEncodingTransformIiiEENS_24MeshPredictionSchemeDataINS_24MeshAttributeCornerTableEEEED0Ev[_ZN5draco36MeshPredictionSchemeTexCoordsEncoderIiNS_37PredictionSchemeWrapEncodingTransformIiiEENS_24MeshPredictionSchemeDataINS_24MeshAttributeCornerTableEEEED5Ev]' /usr/bin/ld: /usr/local/lib/libdraco.a(decode.cc.o): relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `_ZTVN5draco23PointCloudKdTreeDecoderE' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC /usr/bin/ld: final link failed: bad value collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status make[2]: *** [tools/Compression/CMakeFiles/lib_Compression.dir/build.make:117: /home/me/PyMesh/python/pymesh/lib/libPyMesh-Compression.so] Error 1 make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1931: tools/Compression/CMakeFiles/lib_Compression.dir/all] Error 2 make: *** [Makefile:91: all] Error 2
I have tried building draco with "set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)" inserted into the CMAkeLists.txt file, and by doing the same thing to the main build CMakeLists.txt. This just leads to incompatibility issues earlier in the build, related to cgal.
/home/me/PyMesh/tools/Tetrahedralization/TetrahedralizationEngine.cpp:13: /home/me/PyMesh/python/pymesh/third_party/include/CGAL/internal/boost/array_binary_tree.hpp:54:28: error: expected template-name before ‘<’ token 54 | : ::boost::iterator<std::forward_iterator_tag, | ^ /home/me/PyMesh/python/pymesh/third_party/include/CGAL/internal/boost/array_binary_tree.hpp:54:28: error: expected ‘{’ before ‘<’ token /home/me/PyMesh/python/pymesh/third_party/include/CGAL/internal/boost/array_binary_tree.hpp:54:28: error: expected unqualified-id before ‘<’ token In file included from /home/me/PyMesh/tools/Tetrahedralization/CGAL/CGALMeshGen.h:11: /home/me/PyMesh/tools/Tetrahedralization/CGAL/CGALMeshDomain.h: In function ‘auto PyMesh::create_implicit_domain(const MatrixFr&, const MatrixIr&, Oracle&)’: /home/me/PyMesh/tools/Tetrahedralization/CGAL/CGALMeshDomain.h:218:49: error: wrong number of template arguments (1, should be at least 2)
218 | using Domain = CGAL::Labeled_mesh_domain_3; | ^
I've also tried set(CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF) in the main build file.
Does anybody have any ideas about what may be going on? I use Ubuntu 24.04.3. I think that I last built it on Ubuntu 20.something.
Many thanks for ideas on what I might try next.
