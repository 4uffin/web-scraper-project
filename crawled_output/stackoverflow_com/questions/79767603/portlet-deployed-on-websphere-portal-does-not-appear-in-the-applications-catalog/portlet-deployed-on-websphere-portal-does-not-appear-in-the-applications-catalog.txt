Portlet deployed on WebSphere Portal does not appear in the Applications catalog

I’m working with WebSphere Application Server + HCL Digital Experience (formerly WebSphere Portal).
I added a new portlet called NewAccountInfo to an existing WAR module:
Defined it in portlet.xml with org.springframework.web.portlet.DispatcherPortlet.
Added a NewAccountInfo-portlet.xml with a Spring component-scan pointing to the correct package.
Implemented a simple Controller, a VO, and a JSP (just displaying "Hello World").
Packaged and deployed the WAR successfully through the WebSphere console. The update completes without errors and synchronization with nodes works fine.
However, after deployment the new portlet does not show up in the Applications catalog when I try to add it to a page in Portal Administration. I still see only the old portlets.
Question:
What additional steps are required to make a new portlet visible in the WebSphere Portal Applications catalog after deployment?
