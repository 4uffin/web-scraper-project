sortedItemsInDescendingOrder.forEach{ creature ->
//variabile che contiene i cubi della vita
var updatedHealth by mutableStateOf("")
var healthCubes = StringBuilder(updatedHealth)
Text(text = "Name: ${creature.name}", fontSize = 20.sp)
Text(text = "Initiative: ${creature.initiative}", fontSize = 20.sp)
if (creature.health.isEmpty()){
Text(text= "Health: ", fontSize = 20.sp)}
else{
for (i in 0 until creature.health.toInt()){
//☐
//☒
//◫
//⧆
healthCubes.append("☐")
}
val shownHealth = healthCubes.toString()
Text(text= "Health: $shownHealth", fontSize = 20.sp)
Text("Insert Damage")
TextField(
keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(imeAction = ImeAction.Done),
value = "2",
onValueChange = { "2"},
modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())
Row{
Button(onClick = {
if (healthCubes.isNotEmpty()) {
healthCubes.replace(0, 1, "◫") }
} ){
Text("Bashing")
}
Button(onClick = {
if (healthCubes.isNotEmpty()) {
healthCubes.replace(0, 1, "☒") }
} ){
Text("Lethal")
}
Button(onClick = {
if (healthCubes.isNotEmpty()) {
healthCubes.replace(0, 1, "⧆") }
} ){
Text("Aggravated")
}
}
}
HorizontalDivider(thickness = 6.dp)
}
I am trying to have the first health cubes (healthCubes) character changed with the press of a button with another one by using .replace, however the displayed value (shownHealth) doesn't change when i press the buttons, as if the healthCubes.replace line isn't doing anything.
i've tried updating the shownHealth variable by calling it after the healthCubes.replace line, to no avail, since it doesn't seem to be changing anything.
I'm looking to have the healthCubes.replace line(s) to actually change the first character in healthCubes and then to have shownHealth show the change correctly.

The question is already good but i'm conclusing from "I'm looking to have the healthCubes.replace line(s) to actually change the first character in healthCubes and then to have shownHealth show the change correctly." you are trying to change the first character in healthCubes and shownHealth to show the data change, is this correct?

You aren't remembering() the state, so Compose doesn't know it is state and should cause a recompose.
You need to use val updatedHealth = remember { mutableStateOf("") }
