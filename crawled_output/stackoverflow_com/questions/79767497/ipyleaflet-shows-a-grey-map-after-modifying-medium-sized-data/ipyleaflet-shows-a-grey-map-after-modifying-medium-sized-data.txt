I have an app made with Shiny for Python which displays an ipyleaflet map with a couple thousands of markers.
On startup, the map renders fine. However, if I press the "Reload" button to mimick some computations, then the entire map becomes gray and unusable. This only happens when the number of observations in sample() is high enough. In the example below, there are 1,000 points on the same lat/lon.
from shinywidgets import render_widget, output_widget
from ipyleaflet import (
Map,
CircleMarker,
LayerGroup,
)
from shiny import App, reactive, ui
import geopandas as gpd
geo_str = """{
"type": "FeatureCollection",
"crs": { "type": "name", "properties": { "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84" } },
"features": [
{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "id": "ak16994521", "mag": 2.3, "time": 1507425650893, "felt": null, "tsunami": 0 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -151.5129, 63.1016, 0.0 ] } },
]}
"""
dat = gpd.read_file(geo_str, driver="GeoJSON")
app_ui = ui.page_fluid(ui.input_action_button("reload", "reload"), output_widget("map"))
def server(input, output, session):
reactive_dat = reactive.Value(dat.sample(n=1000, replace=True))
@reactive.effect
@reactive.event(input.reload)
def _():
reactive_dat.set(dat.sample(n=1000, replace=True))
@render_widget
def map():
map = Map(zoom=1)
markers = []
for idx, row in reactive_dat().iterrows():
marker = CircleMarker(location=(row.geometry.y, row.geometry.x), radius=3)
markers.append(marker)
map.add_layer(LayerGroup(layers=markers))
return map
app = App(app_ui, server)
I see this error in the browser console:

I'm using uv with pyproject.toml:
[project]
name = "test-shiny-app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
dependencies = [
"geopandas>=1.1.0",
"ipykernel>=6.29.5",
"ipyleaflet==0.17.3",
"ipywidgets==8.1.7",
"shiny==1.5.0",
"shinywidgets>=0.7.0",
]
Did anyone encounter this before? Are there some workarounds?
Reported on github but it may take a while to have an answer there so maybe someone here has info on this: https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny/issues/2088
