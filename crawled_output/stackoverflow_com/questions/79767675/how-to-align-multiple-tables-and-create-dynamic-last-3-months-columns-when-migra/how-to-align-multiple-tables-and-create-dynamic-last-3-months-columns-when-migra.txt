How to align multiple tables and create dynamic last 3 months columns when migrating from Tableau

I am trying to migrate a Tableau dashboard to Power BI, and I’m having difficulty building the tables in the desired format.
I currently have 3 separate tables:
Matrix table – showing Classroom, Section, and PreviousYrRatio.
Last 3 months table – showing dynamic months (e.g., Jun-25, Jul-25, Aug-25).
YTD table – showing year-to-date values.
When I place these 3 tables side by side on the Power BI page, empty space appears between them, and alignment becomes difficult.
I also tried creating a calculation group with 3 columns (PreviousYrRatio, Last 3 Months, YTD), but the issue is that the “Last 3 Months” values appear as a single column instead of showing 3 dynamic month columns with headers.
Question:- How can I build this in Power BI so that the 3 sections (PreviousYrRatio, Last 3 Months, YTD) appear in one aligned table, with the last 3 months shown as separate dynamic columns?
