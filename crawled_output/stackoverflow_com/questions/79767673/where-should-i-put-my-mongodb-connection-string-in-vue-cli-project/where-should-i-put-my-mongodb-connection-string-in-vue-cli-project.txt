Where should I put my MongoDB connection string in Vue CLI project?

I am learning to build an MEVN project. I have a MongoDB connection string that looks like this "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clustername>.abcdefg.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority". During development, I directly embed the connection string in my server.js for convenience.
I'm considering deploying it on somewhere, so I am finding where I should store my connection string in.
Question 1: I tried to put the connection string in .env.local like
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clustername>.abcdefg.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority" in the project root directory,
but logging MONGODB_URI always shows undefined. Does the file location matter, say only the files in the root directory can access .env.local? My Vue version is 2.6.11.
Question 2: I read from somewhere that says "don't put your connection string in your Vue project". Does this statement cover all environment variables, including those in .env and .env.local? How should I set up my connection string to avoid hardcoding in my .js file?
