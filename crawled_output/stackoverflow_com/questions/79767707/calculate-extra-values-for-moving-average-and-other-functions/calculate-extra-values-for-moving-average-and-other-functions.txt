Suppose I have the following dataset:
library(dplyr)
library(zoo)
df <- data.frame(date = seq.Date(from = "2025-01-01", to = "2025-01-10"),
value = 1:10)
df
#>
date value
#> 1
2025-01-01
1
#> 2
2025-01-02
2
#> 3
2025-01-03

2025-01-08

#> 9
2025-01-09

#> 10 2025-01-10

When I calculate the simple moving average for, let's say, the last 5 observations, this is what I get:
df |>
mutate(value_roll = rollapply(value, width = 5, FUN = mean, fill = NA, align = "right"))
#>
date value value_roll
#> 1
2025-01-01

NA
#> 2
2025-01-02

NA
#> 3
2025-01-03

As expected, the first 4 values are NA. However, for a simple moving average of order k, I'd like that the first k-1 values were the first simple moving average of order j-1, k = 1, ..., k-1. For example,
#>
date value
value_roll
#> 1
2025-01-01

#> 2
2025-01-02

2025-01-09

#> 10 2025-01-10

Also, I want to be able to inform other functions for the argument FUN in the rollapply function, such as sum (i.e., the sum of the last k values) and sd (i.e., the standard deviation of the last k values), but in the same fashion as the moving average.
Is there a simple way to do it in R? I bet there is, but I couldn't come with any simple idea. They are all too complex for my taste.

rollapply from {zoo} has a partial-argument, did you read the docs? This might be appropriate here. Most other rolling apply functions from several packages have similar arguments. Side note: df masks F Distribution density function from {stats}. xyzzy, X, ts123, ... might be more appropriate names.

From help(zoo::rollapply):
partial
logical or numeric. If FALSE (default) then FUN is only applied when all indexes of the rolling window are within the observed time range. If TRUE, then the subset of indexes that are in range are passed to FUN. A numeric argument to partial can be used to determin the minimal window size for partial computations. See below for more details.
e.g.
data.frame(date = seq.Date(from='2025-01-01', to='2025-01-10'), value = 1:10) |>
transform(value_roll = zoo::rollapply(
value, width=5, FUN=mean, fill=NA, align='right', partial=TRUE))
gives
date value value_roll

Weird, I need as.Date() around the dates, and a by/length.out term to make seq.Date work... 2025-09-17T19:21:39.813Z+00:00

I added session info. I recall having faced a similar issue in the past, though I don’t remember the specifics or where it occurred. I’ll circle back to this once I encounter it again. 2025-09-17T20:15:28.543Z+00:00

Looks like seq.Date had some updates with 4.5.0, which I'm not using yet. Thanks! cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html 2025-09-17T21:13:32.697Z+00:00

You can create a "sub-frame" with slider::slide_dfr() with all your windowed calculations; mutate(), when called without a name, unnests it to columns:
tibble::tibble(date = seq.Date(from = "2025-01-01", to = "2025-01-10"), value = 1:10) |>
dplyr::mutate(
slider::slide_dfr(
value,
.f = \(x) data.frame(mean_roll = mean(x), sum_roll = sum(x), sd_roll = sd(x)),
.before = 4
)
)
#> # A tibble: 10 × 5

You can define a customized moving average function mva
using cumsum + stats::filter
mva <- \(v, n = 5) c(
cumsum(v[1:(n - 1)]) / seq.int(n - 1),
na.omit(stats::filter(v, rep(1 / n, n), sides = 1))
)
or using embed + rowMeans
mva <- \(v, n = 5) c(
rowMeans(embed(c(rep(NA, n - 1), v), n), na.rm = TRUE)
)
Then, you can run mva like below
df %>%
mutate(value_roll = mva(value))
and you will obtain
