I have difficulties replacing the ggh4x package with the legendry package when it comes to nested lines and text.
The main problem is that the text on the left is below the vertical line instead of in the middle of it. In addition, the texts next to the bars (not visible in the images I've added) are not exactly in the middle of the bars but slightly below them (kind of similar to the text next to the vertical line?)
Desired Output
| Current Output
The code snippet where I use the legendry package (this also falls within a function for custom images that is constructed as function(df, uov, height, width):
plot = ggplot(df_select,
aes(
x = reorder(paste0('   ', naam_artikel, "&", str_wrap(Hoofdstuknaam, 10)), -volgorde_aangepast),
y = StandOWBmln
)
) +
geom_bar(stat = 'identity',
fill = kleur['tk_blauw1'],
width = 0.5
) +
scale_x_discrete(
guide = legendry::guide_axis_nested(
key = "&",
theme = theme(
axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, lineheight = 0.9),
legendry.axis.group.text = element_text(vjust = 0.5))
)
) +
coord_flip() +
theme_tk() +
labs(
y = "xxxxx",
title = titel,
subtitle = subtitel,
caption = "Bron: xxxxx"
) +
theme(
axis.title.y = element_blank(),
panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
legendry.axis.nestline.y = element_line()
)
ggsave(paste("xxxxxxxx", naam,".png"), height = height, width = width)
How can I solve this with the legendry package?

Hi Anna, welcome to Stackoverflow. You have a better chance of receiving a good answer, if you provide a minimal reproducible example. Ideally, we can copy your code and directly reproduce the issue on our machine. Please add library calls and include necessary objects using dput(df_select).

Please edit your question to provide a minimal reproducible example of your code and data along with relevant errors so that readers can run your code to answer your question. If your question was closed for that reason, please still edit it and it will get reopened and then (most likely) answered. Cheers.

Your question doesn't include a reproducible example so I'm going to improvise off the examples in the ?legendry::guide_axis_nested() documentation.
First, here is a regular plot using the axis.
library(legendry)
#> Loading required package: ggplot2
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(interaction(drv, cyl), hwy)) +
geom_boxplot() +
scale_x_discrete(guide = "axis_nested")
p
When we use coord_flip(), we get the problem you're mentioning. This is because the axis will lookup the text settings like justification for the x-axis, while placed at the y axis. coord_flip() is superseded, so I don't think legendry will support this in the future.
p + coord_flip()
Instead, you should be able to swap around the aesthetics and the guide will be formatted normally again.
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy, interaction(drv, cyl))) +
geom_boxplot() +
scale_y_discrete(guide = "axis_nested")
