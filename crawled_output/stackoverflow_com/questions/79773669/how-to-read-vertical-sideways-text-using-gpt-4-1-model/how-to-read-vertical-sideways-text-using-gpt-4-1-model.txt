So, I am trying to write a code where I read a pdf using PaddleOCR. I am storing the text output as a list and then passing it to the LLM (GPT 4.1 model) as a string input alongside of the pdf pages, converted as an image. I want the model to be able to refer to the image and then arrange the text in a custom order that is mentioned as System prompt.
The target of the code is to let the LLM be able to read specific parts of the pdf page, which is essentially a flowchart, and leave out some of the blocks that aren't necessary. I am using an OCR as the LLM is jumbling up some of the text in the flowchart; so I am giving the extracted text as an input to it. Taking them, the LLM needs to match the area where the text was written and if the area of the flowchart is not the to-be-excluded portion, then the text needs to be considered and put into the specific format for the output (which is a json script).
I am able to achieve more or less a good output, but there are some texts which are written rotated sideways, thus vertical texts. The GPT 4.1 model is ignoring those texts and only considering the horizontal ones only.
Could you please help me with this problem?

The issue isn’t with GPT-4.1, it’s with the OCR stage. By default PaddleOCR skips or misreads sideways text unless you enable orientation classification. Try this when initializing:
ocr = PaddleOCR(use_angle_cls=True, lang='en')
That will rotate detected text blocks before recognition.
If you still miss some, check the bounding boxes—if a box is taller than wide, rotate that region and re-run OCR. After that, you can safely pass both the text and coordinates to GPT for filtering/structuring.

Hi, so I used this feature of PaddleOCR, but the issue isn't yet solved. Is there any way to solve it? The sideways text are getting extracted perfectly using the OCR but the GPT 4.1 LLM is unable to categorize the sideways text properly based on the region of the flowchart. 2025-09-25T03:28:10.94Z+00:00
