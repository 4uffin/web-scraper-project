To check if a Bash variable is negative and set it to 0 if it is, use an
if statement with a numeric comparison: if [[ $variable < 0 ]]; then variable=0; fi. Alternatively, use the arithmetic ((...)) context for a concise solution: variable=$((variable < 0 ? 0 : variable))
flacfile=1000
limitflacfile=750
divlimitNew2=(`expr $flacfile - $limitflacfile`)
divlimitNew=$(($divlimitNew2 < 0 ? 0 : divlimitNew)) # this part is where it not works as expected
if [[ $divlimitNew2 < 0 ]]; then divlimitNewX=0; fi
# this part is where it not works as expected
echo "flacfile $flacfile"
echo "limitflacfile $limitflacfile"
echo "divlimitNew2 $divlimitNew2"
echo "divlimitNew $divlimitNew"
echo "ivlimitNewX $ivlimitNewX"
output
flacfile 1000
limitflacfile 750
divlimitNew2 250
divlimitNew 0
# there ist should be 250 because the it is possitive number and > 0
divlimitNewX
output after exchange the number flacfile and the limitFlacfile
flacfile 750
limitflacfile 1000
divlimitNew2 -250
divlimitNew 0
divlimitNewX
# there ist should be 0 because the it is negative number

divlimitNew=$(($divlimitNew2 < 0 ? 0 : divlimitNew)) is this a typo? I think the last divlimitNew should actually be divlimitNew2. Also [[ $divlimitNew2 < 0 ]] is a string (lexicographic) comparison, you should use [[ $divlimitNew2 -lt 0 ]] to compare numbers.
