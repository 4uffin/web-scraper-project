How to disable "blow up" behavior when opening a dialog window on Windows 11?

I have a VCL app written in Delphi 12.3. It displays a dialog over a form.
The dialog may be displayed as the result of a toolbar speedbutton click, or from a menu selection; if called from the speedbutton click, it is displayed positioned as if it was a dropdown from the button; if called from the menu selection, it is centered on the underlying form.
On Windows 11, the standard behavior when initially displaying a dialog is that it "blows up" - the dialog is initially displayed as smaller than its designed size, and then it quickly expands up to its designed size.
I'm OK with this behavior when the dialog is displayed as centered, but when displayed from the speedbutton click, I want it to display at full size immediately, the same way a dropdown on a main menu displays.
Is there a way to tell Windows (or the VCL) to not perform this "blow up" behavior for a particular dialog?

Forms with a BorderStyle of bsToolWindow or bsSizeToolWin don't appear to have the blow-up behavior.
I can change that property to get the behavior I want.

I use the following code to disable the animations:
uses
Winapi.DwmApi;
procedure TurnWindowAnimationsOff(WindowHandle: HWnd);
var
Value: integer;
begin
Value := 1;
// 1 to disable
DwmSetWindowAttribute(
WindowHandle,
DWMWA_TRANSITIONS_FORCEDISABLED,
@Value,
SizeOf(Value));
end;
