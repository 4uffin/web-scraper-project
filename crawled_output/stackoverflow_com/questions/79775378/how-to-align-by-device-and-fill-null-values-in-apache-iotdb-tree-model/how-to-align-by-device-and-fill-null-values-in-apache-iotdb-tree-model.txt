I have two time series in Apache IoTDB 2.0.5, both with some null values at certain timestamps:
INSERT INTO `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`(`time`, value) VALUES (2025-09-16T14:15:28.000, 12.0), (2025-09-16T14:15:58.000, 10.0), (2025-09-16T14:16:28.000, 11.0), (2025-09-16T14:16:58.000, `NULL`), (2025-09-16T14:17:28.000, 12.0), (2025-09-16T14:17:58.000, 18.0);
INSERT INTO `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`(`time`, value) VALUES (2025-09-16T14:15:28.000, 14.0), (2025-09-16T14:15:58.000, 20.0), (2025-09-16T14:16:28.000, `NULL`), (2025-09-16T14:16:58.000, 21.0), (2025-09-16T14:17:28.000, 22.0), (2025-09-16T14:17:58.000, 12.0);
I want to align the data by device and fill in the null values.
So I execute the following query,
SELECT value FROM `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DDC001, `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DAV001 WHERE `time` >= 2025-09-16T14:15:40.000 AND `time` < 2025-09-16T14:17:40.000 align by device fill(previous)
And it throws an error:
Msg: org.apache.iotdb.jdbc.IoTDBSQLException: 700: Error occurred while parsing SQL to physical plan: line 1:179 mismatched input 'fill' expecting {<EOF>, ';'}
If I remove FILL or swap the order of ALIGN and FILL, the query executes without errors, but the null values are missing:
SELECT value FROM `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DDC001, `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DAV001 WHERE `time` >= 2025-09-16T14:15:40.000 AND `time` < 2025-09-16T14:17:40.000 align by device
SELECT value FROM `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DDC001, `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DAV001 WHERE `time` >= 2025-09-16T14:15:40.000 AND `time` < 2025-09-16T14:17:40.000 fill(previous) align by device
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+-----+
| `Time`| Device|value|
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+-----+
|2025-09-16T14:15:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 10.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 11.0|
|2025-09-16T14:17:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 12.0|
|2025-09-16T14:15:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 20.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 21.0|
|2025-09-16T14:17:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 22.0|
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+-----+
If I remove ALIGN, the query runs without errors, but the results are not aligned by device:
SELECT value FROM `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DDC001, `root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14`.*.DAV001 WHERE `time` >= 2025-09-16T14:15:40.000 AND `time` < 2025-09-16T14:17:40.000 fill(previous)
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| `Time`|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001.value`|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001.value`|
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
|2025-09-16T14:15:58.000+08:00| 10.0| 20.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:28.000+08:00| 11.0| 20.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:58.000+08:00| 11.0| 21.0|
|2025-09-16T14:17:28.000+08:00| 12.0| 22.0|
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
I want the query result to be aligned by device while filling null values (using FILL(previous)), like this:
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+-----+
| `Time`| Device|value|
+-----------------------------+----------------------------------+-----+
|2025-09-16T14:15:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 10.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 11.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 11.0| -- Filled `null`
|2025-09-16T14:17:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m1.DDC001`| 12.0|
|2025-09-16T14:15:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 20.0|
|2025-09-16T14:16:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 20.0| -- Filled `null`
|2025-09-16T14:16:58.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 21.0|
|2025-09-16T14:17:28.000+08:00|`root.db.YJEUG88.tms.ch14.m2.DAV001`| 22.0|

How should I adjust the SQL query to achieve both alignment by device and null value filling?
