I have struct that is made to import parameters for connecting to a SQL Server. The code looks like this:
public readonly struct SqlConnect
{
public SqlConnect(string server, string database, string user, string password)
{
Server = server;
Database = database;
User = user;
Password = password;
}
public string Server { get; }
public string Database { get; }
public string User { get; }
public string Password { get; }
public string ConnectionString => "Server=" + Server + ";Database=" + Database + ";User Id=" + User + ";Password=" + Password + ";";
}
The parameters are read from a .json file which also has a bunch of other things in it. My IDE doesn't like that the server, database, user and password properties are public.
This is the code where assignment is done
var configFile = File.ReadAllText(Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFilesX86) + @"\Alarm\AlarmConfig.json");
_configuration = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Configuration>(configFile);
If I set them to private, when I assign everything to the configuration struct, all of these, including the ConnectionString, are null.
What can I do to fix this and have my IDE leave me in peace!

Side note: ideally code shown in a post should be minimal reproducible example and not something that immediately trigger comment threads about insecure storing of information or trying to steal secrets... Sample with a struct with one field and Desreilaize call from inline constant would be much better... along with including exact error.

Side note 2: please confirm that you understand what it means to use struct - it is extremely rare to be a right choice for most code and only cause troubles if you are not 110% sure why you use it.

Side note: for the ConnectionString property, build it with SqlConnectionStringBuilder, instead of using string concatenation, so that any escaping that's needed is done. As soon as the password has a semicolon in it, this code will fail, not to mention the injection opportunities that are present.

Are Configuration in the deserialization code and SqlConnect in the code above it meant to be the same thing, or is thre an intermediate step ?
