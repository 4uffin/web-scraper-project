Here's is output from Odoo shell
>>> env['stock.quant'].search([('on_hand','=',True),('product_id','=',6800)])
stock.quant(1189, 7017, 7914)
>>> p=env['product.product'].browse(6800)
>>> p
product.product(6800,)
>>> p.stock_quant_ids
stock.quant(141, 1189, 1197, 7017, 7914)
>>> p.stock_quant_ids.filtered_domain([('on_hand','=',True)])
stock.quant()
So here's is what I'm trying to do: I want to get all stock quants for a given product where on_hand == True
When I search directly on the stock.quant model and filter by the product id, I get the expected result.
The product model has a stock_quant_ids field with all its stock quants prefiltered by the given product (this recordset includes all records in 1. above). However, when I filter this result for on_hand == True, I get an empty recordset
I expected the 1. and 2. to produce the same result, so I'm wondering why this. I would appreciate any insight to help me understand this behaviour?

If you look at Odoo's source code you'll see this
class StockQuant(models.Model):
on_hand = fields.Boolean('On Hand', store=False, search='_search_on_hand')
Which means that the on_hand field is not stored in the database, but calculated
My guess is that only search does the proper filtering in the database, but the other methods don't, so better stick with it.
You can also do this (from my own Odoo instance)
In [2]: p=env['product.product'].browse(6275)
In [3]: p
Out[3]: product.product(6275,)
In [4]: p.stock_quant_ids
Out[4]: stock.quant(11431, 14798, 16564, 126403, 133012, 166809)
In [5]: p.stock_quant_ids.mapped('id')
Out[5]: [11431, 14798, 16564, 126403, 133012, 166809]
In [6]: env['stock.quant'].search([('id', 'in', p.stock_quant_ids.mapped('id')), ('on_hand', '=', True)])
Out[6]: stock.quant(126403, 133012, 166809)

I'm aware it's a computed field, but you are probably right - it must have something to do with that. I have always thought the purpose of the search parameter is to allow the field to be searchable like a regular stored field so this is kind of surprising....maybe someone has a technical explanation for this behavior 2025-09-17T19:58:10.183Z+00:00
