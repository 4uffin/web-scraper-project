I published a new manifest version to the add-in store, and since then one of my users sees the following error.
This user is in a company whose IT department manage availability and installation of the add-in.
Is this the reason the user sees this error? And is there a better experience that I can offer the user in this situation.
I can't, for example, contact the IT department of every company that uses my add-in.
As a worst case, I can email all users when there is a new version and ask them to get their IT departments to install the new version, but that's not ideal.

We have an ongoing incident that we are investigating here. We believe that it is related to corruption of the Add-in Cache.
Forcing a "Refresh" from the Store dialog or restarting Office appears to resolve this for most users.
