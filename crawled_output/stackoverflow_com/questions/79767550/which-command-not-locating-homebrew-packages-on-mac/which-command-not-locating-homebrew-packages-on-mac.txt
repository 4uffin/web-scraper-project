I have been using Homebrew for Mac (15.7, Intel processor) heavily in the past couple of days to install packages needed for gpaw, which is most easily installed for me using pip. One of its major dependencies, libxc, is really only accessible via brew install. I'm running into some issues installing gpaw that seem like they could be traced back to libxc. When I run "which libxc," the command isn't found. I can locate libxc in /usr/local/Cellar, but adding that sequence to PATH doesn't return the correct response for "which libxc."
I'm hoping to get this resolved before I move on to determining if this is a compiler issue or not, which seems much messier.
I had thought that it was primarily a PATH issue, and have confirmed that /usr/local/Cellar is indeed in my path. I added /usr/local to my path just for kicks but it didn't change anything.

Stack Overflow is for programming questions, not questions about using or configuring Unix and its utilities. Unix & Linux or Ask Different would be better places for questions like this.
