JMeter Connection Reset

I'm running into an issue where in the lower environment like Stage, I don't run into any issues with connection reset error that we see, but in Pre-Production.. the pattern started showing whenever it hits 4 minutes that the connection reset would occur at 60,000ms.
So, I changed the TTL (Time-To-Live)/ Connection Timeout in HTTP Request Default to something random like 17,000ms and the issue wasn't as persistent anymore. It showed up when I ran a test originally for 30 minutes, but error showed up at 24 minutes. I assume by increasing the time that the server side will not close the threads as JMeter will refresh it before server can kill it, but I don't know if my thinking is right so if someone could clarify it would help.
The connection reset failures are not just here and there, but once it starts failing there is no success code anymore.
The application team told me the timeout is only 30 seconds as well in both environments.
I assume maybe somewhere in Pre-Production has more networking securities that cause this but unsure.
Another weird issue is that if I stop running the test, and re-run it again right away sometimes the connection reset still occurs.. I assume the connection would be stopped whenever a test is stopped.
Also, response times are extremely fast between 50-800ms
My goal is to be able to run 2-8 hour tests, but unsure how to go about fixing this.
Below is the error log:

there's not much we can do here. it could just be your network. i'd look at using a tool like wireshark to see what's actually happening
