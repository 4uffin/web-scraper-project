What is the Expo 54 way of creating a file in external storage?

I've recently upgraded to expo 54 (from 53) where expo-file-system/next got renamed to expo-file-system and expo-file-system to expo-file-system/legacy.\
I'm currently trying to migrate from the deprecated (/legacy) module to the main one.
But I can't seem to be able to create a file in external storage.
This is working code using the legacy module:
import * as FileSystem from "expo-file-system/legacy";
const SystemIO = FileSystem.StorageAccessFramework;
async function externalSave(fileName: string, content: string) {
const documentUri = SystemIO.getUriForDirectoryInRoot("Documents");
const permission = await SystemIO.requestDirectoryPermissionsAsync(documentUri);
if (permission.granted) {
const targetPath = permission.directoryUri;
const createdPath = await SystemIO.createFileAsync(
targetPath,
fileName,
"application/json",
);
await SystemIO.writeAsStringAsync(createdPath, content);
} else {
// error handling
}
}
And this is the modern attempt
import { Directory, File } from "expo-file-system";
async function externalSave(fileName: string, content: string) {
// uri => content://com.android.externalstorage.documents/tree/primary%3ADocuments/
const directory = await Directory.pickDirectoryAsync("Documents");
// exists => false
const file= new File(directory.uri, `${fileName}.${jsonExtension}`);
// throws here
file.create({ overwrite: true });
// Also tried write without create and got the same error cause
file.write(content);
}
This is the error caused by file.create
Call to function 'FileSystemFile.create' has been rejected.
→ Caused by: A folder with the same name already exists in the file location
When the modern externalSave is called, the user is prompted to select a directory in the external storage (starting with /documents), a File object is created (whose exists property is false) and then the file.create call throws the above error.
What is the proper way of creating a file in external storage, and writing to it?

After reading the documentation for Directory (not sure why it's not under file but ok) I found the method Directory#createFile.
Which is a method of Directory that accepts the name of the file (without extension) and its mime type, and it creates a file under the directory that it's called.
Here is a working example based on my original approach:
import { Directory, File } from "expo-file-system";
async function externalSave<T>(fileName: string, content: T) {
const directory = await Directory.pickDirectoryAsync("Documents");
// can replace the mime type with whatever you need like text/plain for .txt
// or pass it as a parameter if it's not constant
const createdFile = directory.createFile(fileName, "application/json");
createdFile.write(JSON.stringify(content));
}
