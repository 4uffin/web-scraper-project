RC-5 IR protocol, out of solution

This is my first post ! I recently bought a Cambridge Audio Azur 651A with no remote, I just want to make sure everything on the remote side works. It uses the Philips RC-5 protocol.
I wrote a very simple program for a PIC18F2550 with CCS C Compiler to control the amp.
This is my problem and I tried every solutions I could think of. Every even command (bit0 value 0) are working but all the odd command (bit0 value 1) are not ??
I inserted a printf to check with Putty if every 14 bits were send correctly and they were !
So I don't know what is the problem ?? This is my program:
#include <18F2550.h>
#device adc=10
#fuses HS
// High speed Osc (> 4Mhz for PCM/PCH)
#fuses NOWDT
// No watch dog timer
#fuses NOPROTECT
// Code not protected from reading
#fuses NOLVP
// No low voltage programming
#fuses NODEBUG
// No debug mode for ICD
#fuses CPUDIV1
// No System Clock Postscaler
#fuses PUT
// Power Up Timer
#use delay(clock=20MHZ)
// 20 Mhz crystal
// Software UART, not using UART hardware pins.
// Can use any pins for xmit and rcv !!
//#use rs232(baud=57600, xmit=PIN_C6, rcv=PIN_C7, errors)
// Hardware UART, using UART hardware pins.
//#use rs232(baud=9600, UART1, ERRORS)
// PWM is on pin RC2
// IRLED = 1 (to turn PWM Off, set pin as input)
// IRLED = 0 (to turn PWM On, set pin as output)
// This is the only way for changing pin RC2 direction without
// affecting the other pins on PORTC.
#byte TRISC=getenv("SFR:TRISC")
#bit
IRLED=TRISC.2

Welcome to StachOverflow. Please take a tour and see How to Ask. Specifically: it is not clear what the actual specific problem is. Also - if you use a C compiler, you should remove the c++ tag and add c instead.

I removed all the comments at the top, it is up to you to provide a minimal reproducible example that is free of clutter. So showing the code for sending only one command would be enough. Have you ruled out any hardware issues? Is the led really sending infrared pulses? (Note your code is distincly "C" not C++)

Thank you for your respond. Like I said, commands Amp_on, USB, S1, S5, Vol_up and Speaker works, no problem but only commands with bit0 set to 1 don't work !! Like if the Amplifier does not decode the last bit sent ?? I have no idea why !

Should the IRLED get set to a known state at the end of the 14 bits? Since a final 0 bit works, try adding IRLED = 1; after the for loop.

That was exactly the problem ! The second phase for a 0, the IR led is OFF and the opposite for a 1. So when bit0 was set to 1, the IR led kept pulsating and the amplifier decoded it has an error !! Problem solved, thanks for everyone who read my post !

As I suspected in my comment, the problem is that the IR LED PCM was not being turned off (by setting IRLED = 1) after transmission of the 14-bit word. For words where the final bit is a 0, the IR LED PCM is already turned off at the end, but for words where the final bit is a 1, the IR LED PCM remains turned on at the end indefinitely, which may be confusing the receiver.
The solution is to turn off the IR LED PCM explicitly after the final bit of the the 14-bit word has been sent:
// Send the 14-bit RC-5 Protocol
for (int8 i = 0;i < 14;i++)
{
if (bit_test(command,(13-i)))
{
// According to RC-5
IRLED = 1;
delay_us(890);
IRLED = 0;
delay_us(890);
}
else
{
// According to RC-5
IRLED = 0;
delay_us(890);
IRLED = 1;
delay_us(890);
}
}
// IR Led OFF
IRLED = 1;
