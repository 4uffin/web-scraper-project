Check this dialog box implementation.
const open = document.getElementById('open')
const dlg = document.getElementById('dlg')
open.addEventListener('click', function () {
dlg.showModal()
})
dlg.addEventListener('close', function () {
console.log('You chose:', dlg.returnValue)
})
<button id="open">Open</button>
<dialog id="dlg">
<form method="dialog">
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<button value="no">No</button>
<button value="yes">Yes</button>
</form>
</dialog>
Follow these steps:
Run the above code snippet.
Click "Open" button.
Click "No" in the dialog box.
The console log shows You chose: no.
Click "Open" button again.
Cancel the dialog box by pressing Esc.
The console log shows You chose: no.
On Firefox v143, step 7 prints:
You chose: no
On Chrome v140, step 7 prints:
You chose:
Is the value of returnValue when we cancel the dialog box with Esc left undefined in the spec? Or does the spec specify the returnValue in this situation?

Editing your question in such a way it invalidates the already provided answers is not great, so I'll leave that as a comment, but Firefox would be correct here. Per specs, closing the dialog doesn't change its returnValue and there is nothing else happening in your demo that's supposed to change it. So step 3, through the form submission algo will set the value to whatever is the clicked button's value, and it should stay to that until step 7.

Of note, they do match the specs for light-dismiss.

Esc closes the dialog box, leaving dlg.returnValue unchanged. Esc does not submit the form, so it does not change dlg.returnValue. If you run your test by clicking "yes" first, then Esc, you will see that "You chose: yes" will be displayed.

If this is the reason, then how do you explain why we see You chose:
in step 7 when we perform this experiment on Chrome? 2025-09-24T09:46:15.11Z+00:00

I note that you edited and changed your question in a significant way. You originally asked about Firefox. Now you are asking about the spec. I invite you to read the spec. Not a bad idea at all. 2025-09-25T00:27:27.303Z+00:00
