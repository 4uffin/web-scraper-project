Jetpack Compose: How to align item in Row so that it is at same height than other item?

In Jetpack Compose, I have a Row with two Columns. In Column A, there is only one Text item and in Column B, there are three text items. I would like the center part to be at the same height, i.e. in the example below I want the two texts "Hello World" to be at the same height.
With this example:
Row {
Column() {
Text("Hello World")
}
Column() {
Text("first")
Text("Hello World")
Text("last")
}
}
I get the following result:
But I want the two "Hello World"s to be on the same line.
I have tried things like alignByBaseLine() or alignBy(LastBaseLine), but for obvious reasons this does not work. Can I make the Column B define where its baseline starts?
Aligning at the center stops working as soon as first or last are longer elements that wrap around or have different heights for other reasons.
I can't really invert the structure:
Row {
Column {
}
Column { Text("first") }
}
Row {
Column { Text("Hello World") }
Column { Text("Hello World") }
}
Row {
Column {
}
Column { Text("last") }
}
because first -> Hello World -> last is a single Component and I have dumbed down the example a bit.
