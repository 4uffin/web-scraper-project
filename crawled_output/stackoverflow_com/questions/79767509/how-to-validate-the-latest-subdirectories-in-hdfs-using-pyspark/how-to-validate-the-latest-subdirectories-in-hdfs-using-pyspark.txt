I need to check the subdirectory status in HDFS and based on that I need to flag a column.
My desired output is:
Date
SourceName
SourceType
IndName
IndValue
2024.01.30
PPL
app
PPL_Repo
OK
2024.01.30
INT
app
INT_Repo
OK
The IndValue should have "OK" or "KO" values based on the date folders present inside the path. If the path contains today folder
or yesterday folder then its "OK" else "KO"
I have multiple dictionary elements to check and update the indicator.
This is my code as of now
dict_kpi = \
{
'PPL_repo': \
{
'path' : '/path/to/ppl/',
'SourceName' : 'PPL',
'SourceType' : 'app',
'format' : 'parquet',
'filter' : None,
'datepattern' : 'date=%Y-%m-%d',
'IndValue' : None,
'IndName' : 'PPL_Repo'
},
'INT_Repo': \
{
'path' : '/path/to/int/',
'SourceName' : 'INT',
'SourceType' : 'app',
'format' : 'json',
'filter' : 'context == sign',
'datepattern' : '%Y-%m-%d',
'IndValue' : None,
'IndName' : 'INT_Repo'
}
}
dfs = []
for _date in [datetime(2024,01,30)]:
for j in dict_kpi.values():
cols_selected = \
[
F.lit(str(_date)[0:10]).alias('Date'),
F.lit(j['SourceName']).alias('SourceName'),
F.lit(j['SourceType']).alias('SourceType'),
F.lit(j['IndName']).alias('IndName'),
j['IndValue'].alias('IndValue')
]
dfs.append(spark.read.format(j['format']).load(os.path.join(j['path'],
_date.strftime(j['datepattern']))).select(*cols_selected))
dfs[0].show()
This is not working as expected. I will have many elements in the dictionary with different path, fileformat, datepattern and different filters
If difference between the two dates is more than 1 day, apply a "KO" flag.
Otherwise check the presence of filter. If exists then "OK" else "KO".
What changes are required for this.
