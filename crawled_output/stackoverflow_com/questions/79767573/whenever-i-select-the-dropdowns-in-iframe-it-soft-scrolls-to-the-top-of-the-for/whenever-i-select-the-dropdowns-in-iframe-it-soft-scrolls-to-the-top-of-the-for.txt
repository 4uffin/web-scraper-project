In a React app, the sign-up component behaves correctly. However, when embedded in an iframe, choosing any option in a dropdown causes the viewport to scroll to the top of the form.
Here is the react code with MUI
<Stack direction={{ xs: 'column', sm: 'row' }} alignItems="center" spacing={2}>
<Stack width={1}>
<Typography>How would you like to pay?</Typography>
</Stack>
<Stack width={1}>
<Field.Select name="paymentMethod" label="Payment Method" required>
{payments.map((option) => (
<MenuItem key={option.id} value={`${option.id}::${option.name}`}>
{option.name}
</MenuItem>
))}
</Field.Select>
</Stack>
</Stack>
It works well in react, but not working in iframe

<iframe src="..." scrolling="no" style="overflow: hidden;" />
you can try like this
or
Material UI Select uses a portal by default to render the dropdown menu. This can cause issues in iframes. You can disable it:
<Field.Select
name="paymentMethod"
label="Payment Method"
required
MenuProps={{ disablePortal: true }}
>
{payments.map((option) => (
<MenuItem key={option.id} value={`${option.id}::${option.name}`}>
{option.name}
</MenuItem>
))}
</Field.Select>

I set disablePortal as true but scroll is still moved.
The diffierence is before setting disablePortal, scroll moves to top of the screen, but for now, it moves to above slightly 2025-09-17T18:34:43.11Z+00:00

try disabling scroll anchoring like this
html {
overflow-anchor: none;
}
or prevent focus scroll like this
<ComboboxInput
onFocus={(e) => {
e.preventDefault();
e.target.scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest', inline: 'nearest' });
}}
...
/>
or you can use scrollIntoView with preventScroll like this
element.focus({ preventScroll: true }); 2025-09-17T18:42:26.563Z+00:00
