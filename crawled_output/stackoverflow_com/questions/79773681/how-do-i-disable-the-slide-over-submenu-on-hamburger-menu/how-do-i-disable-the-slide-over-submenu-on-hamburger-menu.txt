In my application a hamburger menu by DevExpress is used. All user controls are collected in several groups. Icons of each group are displayed in the menu. When clicked on the menu expands inline resizing the user control and showing the groups headers wiith their icons as well as the members of the groups. But if clicked on a group header again a menu slides over the user control displaying the same groupmembers already listed below in the expanded hamburger menu.
I have to avoid using the view style "overlay" as there are issues with the user control when it shows a webvie2 page.
Menu Example
<Window.Resources>
<!--<DataTemplate x:Key="HamburgerMenuItemTemplate" DataType="{x:Type model:MainMenuItem}">
<dxwui:HamburgerMenuNavigationButton Content="{Binding Name}" NavigationTargetTypeName="{Binding Content}" />
</DataTemplate>
<DataTemplate x:Key="HamburgerSubMenuItemTemplate" DataType="{x:Type model:MainMenuSubItem}">
<dxwui:HamburgerSubMenuNavigationButton Content="{Binding Name}" NavigationTargetTypeName="{Binding Content}"/>
</DataTemplate>-->
<converters:BoolToVisibilityConverter x:Key="BoolToVisibilityConverter" />
<converters:InverseBoolToVisibilityConverter x:Key="InverseBoolToVisibilityConverter" />
<converters:StatusBarSeverityToColorConverter x:Key="StatusBarSeverityToColorConverter" />
<DataTemplate x:Key="HamburgerSubItemTemplate" DataType="{x:Type navigation:HamburgerSubMenuItemViewModel}">
<!--<dxwui:HamburgerSubMenuNavigationButton
Content="{Binding Name}"
PreviewContent="{Binding PreviewContent}"
ShowInPreview="{Binding ShowInPreview, Mode=OneWay}"
IsSelected="{Binding IsSelected, Mode=TwoWay}"
/>-->
<dxwui:HamburgerSubMenuNavigationButton
Content="{Binding DisplayedName}"
PreviewContent="{Binding PreviewContent}"
ShowInPreview="True"
IsSelected="{Binding IsSelected, Mode=TwoWay}"
AllowDrop="False"
/>
</DataTemplate>
<DataTemplate DataType="{x:Type navigation:HamburgerMenuItemViewModel}">
<dxwui:HamburgerSubMenu
Content="{Binding DisplayedName}"
Glyph="{Binding Icon.Uri}"
AllowGlyphTheming="True"
GlyphWidth="24"
GlyphHeight="24"
UseDefaultSubMenuImageColorizer="True"
Placement="{Binding Placement}"
ItemsSource="{Binding Items}"
IsStandaloneSelectionItemMode="{Binding IsStandaloneSelectionItemMode}"
ItemTemplate="{StaticResource HamburgerSubItemTemplate}"
SelectedItem="{Binding SelectedItem}"
/>
</DataTemplate>
</Window.Resources>
<Grid >
<Grid.RowDefinitions>
<RowDefinition Height="*" />
<RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
<RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
</Grid.RowDefinitions>
<dxwui:HamburgerMenu Name="Menu"
OpenPaneWidth="250"
ViewState="CompactInline"
SyncWithActivePage="True"
AvailableViewStates="Inline"
ItemsSource="{Binding MainMenuItems}"
Content="{Binding SelectedSubItem.Content}"
PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown="Menu_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown">
<dxwui:HamburgerMenu.BottomBarItems>
<!--<dxwui:HamburgerMenuBottomBarNavigationButton Glyph="{Binding SettingsIcon.Uri}" Command="{Binding SettingsCommand}"/>-->
<dxwui:HamburgerMenuBottomBarNavigationButton Glyph="{Binding UserLoginIcon.Uri}" Command="{Binding StartLoginPopup}"/>
<dxwui:HamburgerMenuBottomBarNavigationButton x:Name="MainWindow_ThemeSwitch"
Glyph="{Binding ThemeIcon.Uri}" Command="{Binding ToggleThemeCommand}"/>
<dxwui:HamburgerMenuBottomBarNavigationButton x:Name="MainWindow_LanguageSelection" Glyph="{Binding LocalLanguageIcon.Uri}" Command="{Binding StartLanguagePopUp}"/>
<dxwui:HamburgerMenuBottomBarNavigationButton Glyph="Resources/Icons/mail.svg" Command="{Binding StartLanguagePopUp}" Visibility="Collapsed"/>
</dxwui:HamburgerMenu.BottomBarItems>
</dxwui:HamburgerMenu>
I have tried to find good documentation on which settings i have to change but found nothing useful. I also tried to set the ViewStyle to inline when clicked upon an icon and used ai to no results.
