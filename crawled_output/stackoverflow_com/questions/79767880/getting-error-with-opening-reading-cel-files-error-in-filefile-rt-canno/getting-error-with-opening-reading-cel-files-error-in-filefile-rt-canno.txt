I am at my wits end trying to get this program/code to work supplied by my class. I have a macbook and we are using the simpleaffy package that I have installed. When I try to run the supplied code below I am given either this error "Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection". I have gone into the "get info" tab and changed permissions to "read & write" and clicked the option to include folders within the folder in case this was a permissions error. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions to get this to work? Much appreciated.
pd = read.AnnotatedDataFrame("~/Documents/Biostats/celfiles", header=TRUE,
row.names=1, as.is=TRUE)
Data = ReadAffy(filenames=pData(pd)$FileName, phenoData=pd,
sampleNames= sampleNames(pd))
Redownloading the file in case corrupted, no change
Switching file location, no change
Changing file permissions
Changing working directory - no change
Checked list.files() which shows the .CEL files I am trying to use
TA sent new file with different names in case this would help. Got below error code:
Error in read.celfile.header(as.character(filenames[[1]])) :
Could not open file ~/Documents/Biostats/celfiles/celfiles/Low_1_HG-U133_Plus2.CEL
In addition: Warning messages:
In AllButCelsForReadAffy(..., filenames = filenames, widget = widget, : sampleNames not same length as filenames. Using filenames as sampleNames instead
In read.affybatch(filenames = l$filenames, phenoData = l$phenoData, : Incompatible phenoData object. Created a new one.

Package 'simpleaffy' is a bioConductor package. You should provide enough information about your machine, R version,
package versions, BiocManager and BioConductor versions to assess possibility of version mismatch. (Use sessionInfo())You should also indicate whether that is actually a complete file name instead of the default MacOS practice of hiding extensions in the Finder. (It probably is a .cel file.) And you should indicate where the file can be found.
