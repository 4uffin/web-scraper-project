I am using the infinite scroll with Vue 3 and InstantSearch(Algolia) but the
<ais-search-box placeholder="Search here…" class="searchbox" />
it should be in a different component, because due to the organization of my Vue components and blade components(I am using Laravel), the input search must be in a different place. the input and the results must be in different components. What can I do?
Posts.vue
<template>
<div class="container">
<ais-instant-search
:search-client="searchClient"
index-name="posts"
:insights="true"
:future="{ preserveSharedStateOnUnmount: true }"
>
<div class="search-panel">
<div class="search-panel__results">
<ais-search-box placeholder="Search here…" class="searchbox" />
<app-infinite-hits>
<template #item="{ item }">
<h1><ais-highlight :hit="item" attribute="title" /></h1>
<p><ais-highlight :hit="item" attribute="slug" /></p>
</template>
</app-infinite-hits>
</div>
</div>
</ais-instant-search>
</div>
</template>
<script>
import algoliasearch from 'algoliasearch/lite';
import AppInfiniteHits from '../../Components/InfiniteHits.vue';
export default {
components: { AppInfiniteHits },
data() {
return {
searchClient: algoliasearch(
'XXXXXXX',
'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
),
};
},
};
</script>
and this is the InfiniteHits.vue component:
<template>
<ol v-if="state">
<li v-for="hit in state.items" :key="hit.objectID">
<slot name="item" :item="hit"></slot>
</li>
<li class="sentinel" v-observe-visibility="visibilityChanged"></li>
</ol>
</template>
<script>
import { createWidgetMixin } from 'vue-instantsearch/vue3/es';
import { connectInfiniteHits } from 'instantsearch.js/es/connectors';
export default {
mixins: [createWidgetMixin({ connector: connectInfiniteHits })],
methods: {
visibilityChanged(isVisible) {
if (isVisible && !this.state.isLastPage) {
this.state.showMore();
}
},
},
};
</script>
<style scoped>
.sentinel {
list-style-type: none;
}
</style>
these are the packages I am using:
"algoliasearch": "^4.25.2"
"vue-instantsearch": "^4.21.3",
"vue-observe-visibility": "^1.0.0"
"vite": "^5.2.6",
"vue": "^3.5.18"
