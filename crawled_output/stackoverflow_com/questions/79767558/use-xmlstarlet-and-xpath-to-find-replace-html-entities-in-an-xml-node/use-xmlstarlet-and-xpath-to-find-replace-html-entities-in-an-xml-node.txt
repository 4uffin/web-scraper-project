I have content in the XML node <content type='html'> which uses the HTML entities &lt; and &gt; for < and > , i.e. in input.xml:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>

<content type='html'>Lorem &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.&lt;/p&gt;More Text....</content>
I need to find/replace these entities with < and > so I get this in output.xml:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>....
<content type='html'>Lorem <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>More Text....</content>
Trying this
xmlstarlet edit -N ns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" \
--update "//ns:content" --expr "replace(.,"&lt;","<")" input.xml > output.xml
throws the shell error zsh: command not found: lt
So I think I need to somehow to escape the &lt; in the shell or in xmlstarlet.
is that possible?

There are nested double quotes "replace(.,"&lt;","<")". Single quotes should fix that 'replace(.,"&lt;","<")'

Thanks! That was it. But now I get xmlXPathCompOpEval: function replace not found, Unregistered function. I'm using xmlstarlet --version shows 1.6.1, and these cryptic details: "compiled against libxml2 2.9.13, linked with 20913 compiled against libxslt 1.1.35, linked with 10135"

You should probably use an xslt approach

Looks like xmlstarlet edit’s xpath arguments do not support XSLT functions. from martin7th.github.io/xmlstarlet-notes/#error-messages

All in all that's escaped html within xml. Unescaping it could cause other issues due to broken html.

The replace() function requires XPath 2,0, which although it was published in 2007 is not yet implemented in xmlstarlet.
However, that's not your real problem. xmlstarlet, like other XPath tools, works on the tree representation of a document, not on the surface lexical form. If you insert a < character into the tree representation of a document, then in the lexical serialization it will be turned back into &lt;. What you are really trying to do is to turn part of
a text node into an element node, which can't be done just be modifying characters.
You might be able to solve the problem using xmlstarlet's capabilities for manipulating the lexical XML (escape and unescape) as distinct from its XPath capabilities -- but I'm not sufficiently familiar with it. Personally I would tackle this using XSLT 3.0:
<xsl:template match="content[@type='html']/text()">
<xsl:copy-of select="parse-xml-fragment(.)"/>
</xsl:template>

To refine the answer by Michael Kay, as it doesn't take namespaces into account, here is a complete XSLT 3.0 stylesheet
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
version="3.0"
xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xpath-default-namespace="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"
exclude-result-prefixes="#all"
expand-text="yes">
<xsl:mode on-no-match="shallow-skip"/>
<xsl:template match="content[@type = 'html']">
<xsl:element name="{local-name()}">
<xsl:apply-templates select="@*"/>
<xsl:sequence select="parse-xml-fragment(.)"/>
</xsl:element>
</xsl:template>
<xsl:template match="content[@type = 'html']/@*">
<xsl:attribute name="{local-name()}" select="."/>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
that, when run with e.g. Saxon 12 on the input sample
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
