I have a Vue2js project. We need to stay on Vue2js for the rest of this year.
vue --version
-> @vue/cli 4.5.12
node -v
-> v16.0.0
npm -v
-> 6.14.12
When I run 'npm audit', I see this as a vulnerability:
Critical
ejs template injection vulnerability
Package
ejs
Dependency of
@vue/cli-service [dev]
Path
@vue/cli-service > webpack-bundle-analyzer > ejs
I have tried these things to fix the critical vulnerability but none of these have worked:
npm audit fix
deleting 'node_modules' folder and package-lock.json then running npm install
installing latest ejs
npm list ejs outputs this:
+-- @vue/[email protected]
| `-- [email protected]
|
`-- [email protected]
`-- [email protected]
What can I do to remove 'ejs' as a vulnerability?

You're on the latest @vue/cli-service@3, webpack-bundle-analyzer@3 and ejs@2 so, unless you're willing to override the transitive dependencies and risk them being actually incompatible, you can't. Those major versions are all six years old and not maintained, vulnerabilities are par for the course.
