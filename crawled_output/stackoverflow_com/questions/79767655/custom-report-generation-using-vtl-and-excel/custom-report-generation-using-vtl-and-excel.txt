Custom report generation using VTL and Excel

I am attempting to generate custom reports for a program I am working on. I am a systems engineer using Cameo Systems Modeler and would like to generate a report capturing the changes made between each commit to teamwork cloud. The issue I am running into is this: the VTL code that I have in an excel sheet runs, but does not populate any information. The commands are written correctly as far as I know, but there is very little documentation on how this is supposed to work inside of an Excel document. I need to be able to use Cameos Report Wizard to generate an excel document using VTL and Excel.
I have tried writing and re-writing the VTL commands and adjusting where they are located in the Excel doc, but they always either generate an empty document, or break the document and generates nothing at all. This is an example of the working VTL code that just generates an excel sheet with only the headers but no other information
Update 09/18/25
I am trying to implement this using a word document instead. it is now telling me that it is encountering an end of file error. code from word document pasted below.
Artifact Change Tracker Report Template
Model: $report.name
Generated on: $report.date
Section 1: Blocks
#foreach($artifact in $report.findElementsByType("Block"))
------------------------------------------------------------
Block: $artifact.name
($artifact.id)
Modified? $artifact.isModified
Modified By: $artifact.modifiedBy
Modified Date: $artifact.modifiedOn
#foreach($change in $artifact.changes)
Property: $change.property
Old Value: $change.oldValue
New Value: $change.newValue
#end
Traced Requirements:
#foreach($req in $artifact.clientRelations)
- $req.name ($req.id)
#end
------------------------------------------------------------
#end
