Why is my ALS model suggesting such a high alpha value?

I implemented a recommender system using Ben Fred’s implicit library.
Preprocessing steps I applied:
Removed all users with 200+ interactions per day (likely bots or employees).
Removed all users with fewer than 2 interactions.
Removed all products with fewer than 3 interactions.
Assigned different weights per interaction type:
INTERACTION_WEIGHTS = {
'purchase': 1.0,
'initiate_checkout': 0.7,
'add_to_cart': 0.5,
'add_to_wishlist': 0.3,
'content_view': 0.1
}
Applied time-decay weighting so that recent interactions count more.
Used different decay scales for each interaction type.
Dataset stats:
Number of users: 97,793
Number of products:
32,943
Number of non-zero interactions: 366,931
Density: 0.00011390
Quantiles of weights:
0%: 0.0000
25%: 0.0000
50%: 0.0000
75%: 0.0027
100%: 13.5251
Training loss:
0.000003
...
0.000002
Interaction distribution:
Model configuration:
Default ALS hyperparams:
factors=100
regularization=0.01
alpha=1.0
My "tuned" model:
model = implicit.als.AlternatingLeastSquares(
factors=550,
regularization=0.01,
alpha=2.0,
iterations=25,
calculate_training_loss=True
)
The issue
When running hyperparameter tuning with my scoring method, the best performing alpha comes out around 140.0.
My concern:
This seems extremely high compared to the default alpha=1.0.
It makes me think something might be wrong with my preprocessing, weighting, or evaluation setup.
Evaluation metric:
I use a weighted scoring function that combines several ranking metrics:
score = (
0.3 * precision_10 +
0.25 * precision_5 +
0.2 * auc_10 +
0.15 * map_10 +
0.1 * ndcg_10
)
Question:
Is it normal for alpha to need to be set so high in an implicit ALS setup?
Could this be an artifact of my interaction weighting or density?
Or does it indicate a problem in how I’ve structured my dataset or evaluation pipeline?
