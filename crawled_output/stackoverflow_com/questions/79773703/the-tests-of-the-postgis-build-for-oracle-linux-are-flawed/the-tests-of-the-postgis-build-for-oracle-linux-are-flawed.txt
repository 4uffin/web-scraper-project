I compile the postgresql 16 and postgis 3.4 from source on oracle linux:
./configure
--without-sfcgal --without-address-standardizer --without-topology --without-raster --with-config=/usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_config
and start
make test
I have 5 fail tests.
What is wrong?

No idea, because you don't show details about the failed tests.

If you haven't written any code on your own about this, you should better report this problem to the maintainers of the project you try to build
