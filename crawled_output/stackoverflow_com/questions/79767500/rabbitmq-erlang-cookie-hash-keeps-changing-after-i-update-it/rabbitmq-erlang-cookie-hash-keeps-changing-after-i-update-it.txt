RabbitMQ - Erlang cookie hash keeps changing after I update it

I am trying to run rabbitmqctl list_queues but it is giving me the error where I need to update the erlang cookie hash.
rabbitmqctl list_exchanges
Error: unable to perform an operation on node 'rabbit@hostname'. Please see d
iagnostics information and suggestions below.
Most common reasons for this are:
* Target node is unreachable (e.g. due to hostname resolution, TCP connection o
r firewall issues)
* CLI tool fails to authenticate with the server (e.g. due to CLI tool's Erlang
cookie not matching that of the server)
* Target node is not running
In addition to the diagnostics info below:
* See the CLI, clustering and networking guides on http://rabbitmq.com/document
ation.html to learn more
* Consult server logs on node rabbit@hostname
DIAGNOSTICS
===========
attempted to contact: [rabbit@hostname]
rabbit@hostname:
* connected to epmd (port 4369) on hostname
* epmd reports node 'rabbit' uses port 25672 for inter-node and CLI tool traff
ic
* TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed
* Authentication failed (rejected by the remote node), please check the Erlang
cookie
Current node details:
* node name: 'rabbitmqcli-000-rabbit:hostname
* effective user's home directory: c:\Users\rmq_user
* Erlang cookie hash: 5PR72Jas3UskVVJf8LzC==
I update the following files on the target server with the above cookie hash (I make sure there are no empty lines):
c:\users\rmq_user\.erlang.cookie
c:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\.erlang.cookie
c:\windows\sysWOW64\config\systemprofile\.erlang.cookie
However, when I run the command again, I get a completely new hash:
Current node details:
* node name: 'rabbitmqcli-000-rabbit:hostname
* effective user's home directory: c:\Users\rmq_user
* Erlang cookie hash: kaZPbd53Ap6xGH5hysa==
Everytime I make the change to the above files with the new hash, the erlang cookie hash just changes to another new one.
How can I resolve this so I can actually run the command?
Thanks in advance!
