I am using Apache IoTDB's Table Model (v2.0.4) and need to calculate the SUM of sensor data every Monday between 16:00 and 18:00 over a one-year period.
My data schema is like this:
CREATE TABLE sensors (
device_id STRING TAG,
temperature FLOAT FIELD
);
I tried using the function of date_bin, but failed to restrict the aggregation to Mondays' 16:00 and 18:00. Here is my attempt:
select date_bin(1w,`time`,'2024-01-01 16:00:00.000') as week_time,
sum(temperature) as temp_sum
from sensors
where device_id = 'HK0897'
and (`time` >= 2024-01-01 00:00:00 and `time` <= 2024-12-31 23:59:59)
`group by` 1
This returned the sum of entire weeks (all 7 days).
+-----------------------------+--------+
| week_time|temp_sum|
+-----------------------------+--------+
|2024-01-01T16:00:00.000+08:00| 180.0|
|2024-01-08T16:00:00.000+08:00| 85.0|
| \... | \... |
|2024-12-30T16:00:00.000+08:00| 255.0|
+-----------------------------+--------+
I expect a result set containing 52 rows (one per week) with the sum of temperaturefor each Monday's 16:00-18:00 window over the past year.
How can I correctly filter the aggregation to only Mondays within the specified time range?
