I try to post large file and read response as streaming with requests python library.
I have to send a large text file (2 million lines of log ) and receive response back as streaming. If I did by small batch (30 thousands lines), it is ok , I get immediate stream response. For large file, nothing happens and it is finished by a timeout if I specify a timeout (without timeout it is hanging indefinitely).
import requests
url='http://********:59599'
header = {'specific-app-header':'01-fr-open-edition-03'}
def post(file_path):
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
r = requests.post(
url, headers=header, data=f, stream=True, proxies=None, timeout=180
)
for line in r.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
print(line)
post('/tmp/30_000_lines.log')
# .... lines is display
post('/tmp/2_000_000_lines.log')
# ...
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', TimeoutError('timed out'))
My configuration is:
$python -m requests.help
{
"implementation": {
"name": "CPython",
"version": "3.11.2"
},
"platform": {
"release": "6.1.0-31-amd64",
"system": "Linux"
},
"requests": {
"version": "2.32.3"
},
"urllib3": {
"version": "2.3.0"
},
.....
}
I should point out that the curl command works perfectly (ie:I get stream response):
curl -X
POST http://********:59599 -H specific-app-header:01-fr-open-edition-03 -v --data-binary @/tmp/2_000_000_lines.log
* Connected to ** (*) port 59599 (#0)

maybe problem is on server side. But we can't see code on server to check it.

curl may use different paramters - for sure it use different header user-agent, but it may also have other differences. You may try curl with option -v or --verbose (or even -v -v) to get more details about curl connection.

you may also test both with url http://httpbin.org/post and it should send back all headers, cookies, etc. which code sends to this url. Or you may use local proxy server like Charles or mitmproxy to check differences.

btw: you can also use curl-cffi instead of requests or as adapter in requests - curl-adapter
