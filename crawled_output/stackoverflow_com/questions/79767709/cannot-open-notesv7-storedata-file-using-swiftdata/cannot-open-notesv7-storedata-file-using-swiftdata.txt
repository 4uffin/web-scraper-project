Cannot open NotesV7.storedata file using SwiftData

I have been collecting data in the iOS/macOS Notes.app in a structured format, and want to extract that data using Swift and SwiftData. This code is not going to be used with SwiftUI, so my intent is to read the database, collate and analyze the data, and then export it to tab-delimited files. So, no @ModelActor, etc., that you would do if you were using SwiftUI.
The exploratory code I'm using is as follows:
func fetchNote() throws {
let schema = Schema([Note.self])
let path = "/Users/pf/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata"
let configuration = ModelConfiguration(url: URL(string: "file://\(path)")!, allowsSave: false)
let modelContainer = try ModelContainer(for: schema, configurations: configuration)
let modelContext = ModelContext(modelContainer)
// Example predicate
let notePredicate = #Predicate<Note> {
$0.name == "Data1"
}
let descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Note>(predicate: notePredicate)
let notes = try modelContext.fetch(descriptor)
for note in notes {
print("Title: \(note.name), Content: \(note.content)")
}
}
However, the code fails at try ModelContainer(for:..., configurations: ...). Here's the relevant snippet from the error message in the console:
CoreData: error: Store failed to load.
<NSPersistentStoreDescription: 0x6000008672a0> (type: SQLite, url: file:///Users/pf/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata) with error = Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=256 "The file couldn’t be opened." UserInfo={reason=Unknown failure to access file: 1} with userInfo {
reason = "Unknown failure to access file: 1";
(Higher in the information for this error, it's clear that the file URL is correct because the exact size of the file is displayed. So, the file exists; CoreData cannot open it. Note that the Notes.app is not open on this Mac when I'm trying to access it.)
What am I doing wrong? (Something like this code worked a couple days ago, but I futzed with refactoring it, but since Xcode has no "local history" for files, I tried to reconstruct what had worked. Serves me right for not committing the working code, regardless of how exploratory it was!)

Definitively no, that does not apply because it says to include the scheme which I clearly included in this statement: ModelConfiguration(url: URL(string: "file://\(path)"). Also, the error snippet shows the scheme is included: url: file:///Users/pf/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata)....

In addition, should you forget the scheme, the error is quite different: FAULT: NSInvalidArgumentException: CoreData SQL stores only support file URLs (got /Users/pf/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV7.storedata).

And finally, the path variable is there because I initially surrounded the rest of the code with an if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) block to make sure that the path was correct. Indeed it was, so I removed that block, but didn't inline the code. As I wrote above, this is exploratory code, and will be refactored later. (Xcode after all these years still doesn't have an inline refactoring! Standard with all useful IDEs.)

Note, to open a file in MacOS, depends on both sandboxing settings (entitlements) and Info.plist declarations. Adjust your App Sandbox File Access entitlements or open the file manually with NSOpenPanel, and/or use security-scoped bookmarks.

Ok I retracted my close vote. To clarify, is this an app or a command line tool?
