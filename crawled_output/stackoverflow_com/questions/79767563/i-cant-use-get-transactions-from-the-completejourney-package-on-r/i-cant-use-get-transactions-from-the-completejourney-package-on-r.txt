When I try and run get_transactions() I get the message:
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-x86_64/Resources/library/curl/libs/curl.so':

It's easier to help you if you include a simple reproducible example with sample input and desired output that can be used to test and verify possible solutions. What exactly came before this and what are you passing into the function? You could try reinstalling the curl package with install.packages("curl") and see if that helps.
