Trying something new with Serverless Container Framework which I followed the tutorial using its sample in this repo.
When I first tried it, it didn't work that I had to change type from awsLambda to awsFargateEcs
So my serverless.containers.yml actually look like this
name: example-express
deployment:
type: [email protected]
containers:
service:
src: ./service
routing:
pathPattern: /*
pathHealthCheck: /health
environment:
HELLO: world-yo
compute:
type: awsFargateEcs # or awsLabmda
This worked fine with the default Express in the repo, that the deployment was a success that I am able to view the demo with the cloudfront URL.
The issue I am having now is, I tried changing the code to TS which still works fine when in development mode but when I try to make a deploy.
I happen to get some errors such as Service deployed over 15 minutes or Image cannot be found and I forgot what other random ones.
I tried a few times to clean out all the images, cloudfront, vpc, load balancer, target groups, roles and so on on AWS, when I do this mostly the deployment would exit due to the 15 minutes message.
How can this be done, is there something I'm missing?
