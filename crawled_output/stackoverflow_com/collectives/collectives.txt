Here’s what people are saying about Collectives on Stack Overflow
I think both businesses and developers will benefit from Collectives because they make it easier to connect and keep in touch. Developers have been coming together and helping each other on the Stack Overflow platform for a long time. With Collectives, companies can now also become part of this active community.
Martin Spickermann
Senior Software Developer at Shopify
I’m most excited about the Recognized Member feature. Beyond reputation, I think the Recognized Member badge can more accurately reflect a user’s expertise in a domain. Endorsement by a Recognized Member can also help to increase the visibility of new, better, but not highly voted answers to old questions, encouraging developers to take a closer look before just adopting the highest voted answer.
