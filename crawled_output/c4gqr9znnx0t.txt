Image source, Getty ImagesPhew! What a night of action on the second Sunday of the NFL season, with some thrilling finishes to some epic encounters.It was tight and tense as the Eagles beat the Chiefs in their Super Bowl rematch, but it was a flat out barnburner in the fourth quarter in Dallas.We had five touchdowns scored to take the lead in the final 12 minutes of the game, before the Cowboys eventually edged the Giants 40-37 in overtime.Joe Burrow's injury is a huge worry for the Bengals, but back-up Jake Browning at least engineered a win over the Jaguars, while Aaron Rodgers lost his home debut in Pittsburgh against Seatte.Image source, Getty ImagesMore madness ensued in Miami with back-to-back return touchdowns from each team - the Pats answering a punt return with a touchdown on the ensuing kick-off while a huge Carolina comeback just fell short in Arizona.The Colts won a thriller on the last kick of the game - at the second attempt - and the Lions, Bills and Ravens all dished out heavy defeats on the Bears, Jets and Browns respectively.Not bad for just the second week of the season eh?

Image source, Getty ImagesIt wasn't pretty, but the Philadelphia Eagles followed up their Super Bowl victory with another win over the Kansas City Chiefs - in a game that turned on just one play.What could've been a Travis Kelce touchdown turned into an Eagles interception and then from there Philly used their running power, and the controversial tush push, to see the game out.Both defences played brilliantly, but the Eagles just had an extra bit of qualify on offence to make the big plays at big times, with Patrick Mahomes lacking that depth of talent to throw the ball to.And while the Eagles start the season 2-0, the Chiefs drop to 0-2 for the very first time since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback. Is Chiefs Kingdom crumbling?

And of course that tush piush, this time for a first down, will seal the game for the Eagles and they'll win their Super Bowl rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs in a really hard-fought contest at Arrowhead.

Just when the Panthers' luck is looking to run out, another decision goes against the Cardinals for roughing the passer.We are into the final minute and the Panthers are 33 yards from goal.

On fourth down, quarterback Bryce Young needs five yards to get to first down.He steps back and keeps going for around 20 or so yards before he is tackled, fumbles and the Cardinals take possession.A five-yard penalty against the Cardinals gives Young a reprieve and with less than 90 seconds to go, the Panthers need to go 46 yards for victory.

The Chiefs go for the onside kick despite three minutes still being on the clock. These are tough these days and this one doesn't even go the required 10 yards so the Eagles get it on halfway.I've got to say I don't love that call from Andy Reid again - the Chiefs have played so well on defence I'd have kicked it long and trusted them to get a quick stop.

You would have been forgiven for thinking this match was done and dusted a long time ago.On the contrary...The Panthers get the onside kick to go after that last touchdown and are on the drive in the final two minutes.

The final few seconds sum up how brilliant that much was.Spencer Shrader's second attempt is good and the Colts win 29-28 over the Broncos.For the first time since 2009, the Colts go 2-0.

Patrick Mahomes has a wide open receiver down field but he's way off as he tries to heave it down there for him. That's a huge miss as it was a walk-in touchdown if he could just connect, as Philly's defence had totally missed him.

Another tush push and more controversy as the Eagles are ruled short of a first down, and then are given it.In the end they have to punt soon anyway so the Chiefs have another chance to try and get back into the game.
