As we aim to uphold our content’s integrity and excellence, our Medical Standards and Insights team rigorously evaluates products and their respective brands before featuring them in our content. We also maintain a healthy separation between our editorial and business teams throughout the content creation process for product reviews, product roundups, and articles with shopping links to ensure our content is editorially independent.Read moreOur approach to ensuring health information is accessible to allWe are committed to listening to, engaging with, and amplifying voices of various perspectives through our culture and through our content in order to create a platform and a community that is representative and relevant to all.Read moreOur approach to conscious languageLanguage is a powerful tool that shapes the world around us. It can create and empower identities, but it can also erase and oppress them, so using it consciously is key. At Medical News Today, we know that language matters, and we are invested in using language to create a healthier, stronger, and more accessible world. Employing conscious language in how we speak, write, and edit reflects our awareness of and dedication to the communities that read our content.Read moreOur approach to artificial intelligenceAt Medical News Today, we are passionate about providing accurate and trustworthy medical information, and we believe that human expertise should always be the final seal of approval on all our content before publishing. However, we may use Artificial Intelligence (AI) or similar technology to help develop certain aspects of our content, strictly following our principles regarding its ethical implementation, rigorously vetting its technology, and maintaining and remaining clear and transparent about its usage.Read more© 2025 Healthline Media UK Ltd, London, UK.
