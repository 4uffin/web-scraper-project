Image credit: Tatiana Maksimova/Getty ImagesThe global population of older adults ages 60 and over is expected to jump from 12% in 2015 to 22% by 2050. Past studies show there are several lifestyle factors that can have a negative impact on how healthy older adults may age. A new study says that it may be possible for older adults to regain their optimal well-being by making healthy lifestyle choices, even at age 60 and older. People are living longer than ever — the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that in 2020, around the world there were more people aged 60 and older than children ages 5 and under.And the global population of older adults ages 60 and over is expected to jump from 12% in 2015 to 22% by 2050. As people are expecting to live longer, they also want to stay healthy for as long as possible as they age.However, it is not always that simple — past studies show there are several lifestyle factors that can have a negative impact on an older adults’ well-being, including unhealthy diets, smoking, not getting enough sleep, a sedentary lifestyle, chronic stress, and social isolation. A new study published in the journal PLOS One now reports that it may be possible for older adults to regain their optimal well-being by making healthy lifestyle choices, even at age 60 and older. What is ‘optimal well-being’?For this study, researchers analyzed health data from more than 8,000 older adults who participated in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Study participants were aged 60 or older at recruitment, and did not meet the criteria for “optimal well-being.” “Optimal well-being combines a wide range of both objective and subjective aspects of aging well,” Mabel Ho, PhD, a recent doctoral graduate at the University of Toronto’s Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging and the first author of this study, explained to Medical News Today.“We define optimal well-being as freedom from limitations in daily activities, the absence of severe mental illness, memory issues, or debilitating pain, and the presence of strong social support. It also includes high levels of physical and mental health, happiness, and life satisfaction, regardless of the number of chronic conditions one may have.”– Mabel Ho, PhDHealthy lifestyle choices can help older adults regain optimal well-beingAt the study’s conclusion, researchers discovered that study participants who followed specific healthy lifestyle factors — stayed physically active, did not smoke, slept well, and prevented chronic health conditions like diabetes or osteoporosis — increased their chances of regaining optimal well-being during the 3-year period. “This study offers hope by showing that older adults can regain optimal well-being, even after difficult periods,” Esme Fuller-Thomson, PhD, director of the Institute for Life Course & Aging and professor at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) at the University of Toronto, and senior author of this study, told MNT.“The findings emphasize that modifiable lifestyle factors such as staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, managing chronic conditions, and nurturing mental and social wellness are key to improving well-being,” Fuller-Thomson added.“These factors are achievable and can be supported through programs like older-adult-friendly exercise classes, chronic disease self-management programs, and mental health support,” she continued. “The research highlights the importance of policies and services that promote healthy aging, ultimately demonstrating that with the right support, older adults can thrive and contribute their strengths to society.” Scientists also found that study participants who had baseline psychological and emotional wellness were most likely to re-achieve optimal well-being. “Individuals who were psychologically and emotionally well at the start of the study were nearly five times more likely to achieve optimal well-being after three years,” Fuller-Thomson reported. “This highlights the importance of early interventions that support mental health.” Does aging mean inevitable decline?MNT had the opportunity to speak with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this study.“It is well established that factors like physical activity, not smoking, and social connection contribute to well-being,” Parulekar, who was not involved in this research, commented.“The finding that nearly one-quarter of struggling older adults could regain optimal well-being after getting appropriate comprehensive support in 3 years is encouraging. It powerfully counters the common narrative of aging as an inevitable, one-way decline,” she emphasized.“With a globally aging population, this research is critical for several reasons,” Parulekar continued. “This study outlines the critical need of a combined approach of healthcare and public policy to help improve population health and reduce healthcare burden.““A healthier, thriving older population requires less intensive medical care, lowering costs for society. It can improve quality of life by providing a roadmap for individuals to live more fulfilling, resilient, and joyful later years, even after periods of difficulty. And it gives governments and organizations evidence to invest in effective programs that support financial stability, physical health, and social wellness for older adults,” she told us.Next steps: Motivation, guidance, reinforcement for key lifestyle changesMNT also spoke with David Cutler, MD, a board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this research. Cutler, who was not involved in the study, commented that there are at least three important lessons to learn from it.“Many factors which impact us when we are young can have [a] significant detrimental effect on our well-being as we age,” Cutler said. Moreover, he noted, “while educational, emotional, physical, and financial detriments can impair well-being as we age, they don’t necessarily do so permanently. Developing resilience and engaging in lifestyle changes can overcome these hindrances.”“[T]he pathway to improved well-being may not depend at all on supplements, spa treatments, or expensive interventions,” he continued.“Good nutrition, stopping smoking, regular exercise, managing chronic diseases, mindfulness to improve sleep, fall prevention, and social engagement to prevent isolation and loneliness are all low cost ways to improve well-being.” – David Cutler, MD“It will always be difficult to convince people to give up immediate rewards for long-term benefit,” Cutler added. “The delicious piece of cake today seems more attractive than a slimmer waistline in the future.””Taking a sleeping pill to knock you out is more appealing than weeks of training in cognitive behavioral therapy to improve sleep. And sitting on the couch to watch your favorite TV show sounds better than a strenuous exercise ritual. Finding answers to provide motivation, guidance, and reinforcement in these lifestyle changes will be the next step in research on maintaining well-being in the elderly,” he advised.Mental HealthNutrition / DietSeniors / AgingSports Medicine / FitnessShare this articleWritten by Corrie Pelc on September 24, 2025 — Fact checked by Jill Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D.Latest newsGreen Mediterranean diet, including green tea, may help slow brain agingEven small amounts of alcohol may increase dementia risk, study findsExercise, healthy diet can help older adults regain 'optimal well-being' within 3 yearsMIND diet, 3 other lifestyle interventions may help reduce cognitive declineOzempic may help protect against diabetes-related blindnessRelated CoverageDoes the Mediterranean diet hold the key to longevity?In this episode of In Conversation, Dr. Tom Barber, professor of endocrinology and obesity expert, helps us explore the evidence linking a…READ MORE3 ways to slow down type 2 diabetes-related brain agingThis podcast episode examines two studies that assess the impact type 2 diabetes has on brain health and explores three lifestyle interventions that…READ MOREIn Conversation: Can we really ‘outrun the Grim Reaper’?In this episode of our podcast, editors Maria Cohut and Yasemin Nicola Sakay discuss how extreme exercise may help people live longer with Michael…READ MORECould taking cocoa extract supplements daily prevent age-related heart disease?Participants who took 500 mg of daily cocoa supplements for two years saw a decrease in an inflammatory marker linked to an increased risk of…READ MOREVision loss due to aging may be remedied by new eye dropsA new eye drop formula helped participants improve their ability to read up close, which deteriorates with aging, according to new research presented…READ MORE© 2025 Healthline Media UK Ltd, London, UK.
