Updated on June 23, 2025Visual exam guideSymptoms to look forWhen to do an examSummaryPracticing monthly breast self-examination can help detect irregularities or changes that may indicate cancer. However, there are currently no standard guidelines on when or how to perform these self-exams.The American Cancer Society (ACS) does not recommend regular clinical breast exams or breast self-exams as part of a routine breast cancer screening schedule.This is due to the risk of receiving false results. A false-positive could lead to unnecessary treatment or anxiety, while a false-negative may cause a person to incorrectly assume there is nothing wrong and avoid screening.However, it is essential that people be familiar with how their breasts usually look and feel. One way of doing this is through regular self-exams. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls this breast self-awareness.This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to perform a self-exam of the breasts.How to do a breast self-examShare on PinterestDesign by Diego SabogalA person who is familiar with the features of their breasts has a better chance of spotting any changes that do occur, and this can increase the likelihood of early detection and effective treatment.The National Breast Cancer Foundation suggests three steps for an effective breast self-exam:Do a visual exam, including looking in a mirror.Do a physical exam while standing up.Do a physical exam while lying down.People should pay attention to:the breaststhe underarm areathe wider chest area, as far as the collarbone, the chest bone, and the top of the abdomenThe following sections explain how to carry out the exam in more detail.Visual examA person can do a visual exam in front of a mirror.With the arms down, check for changes in:shape or sizeskin color and texture, such as dimpling and pittingnipple color, texture, and shapevein patterns, especially an increase in the size or number of veinsRepeat these steps with the arms above the head and the body bending slightly forward.Physical exam while standing upPeople often do a standing exam in the shower because the skin is easier to examine when slippery.Use the following steps to perform a standing check:With the pads of the three middle fingers, check all parts of each breast using circular motions.Move from the sides to the center, checking for lumps or knots.Repeat using light, medium, and firm pressure. With the fingers, perform circular movements, up-and-down movements, and “wedge” shaped movements from the outer breast to the nipple and back again.Repeat for the whole chest area on both sides.Physical exam while lying downA lying down exam allows the breast tissue to spread out evenly along the chest wall. In this position, a person can check the whole of both breasts and the wider chest area.To check the breast while lying down, follow these steps:To check the right side, place a pillow under the right shoulder and raise the right arm above the head.Using the left hand, press on all areas of the breast and underarm.Repeat with light, medium, and firm pressure. Check with the fingers by performing the same movements as with the standing exam.Cover the area from under the arm to the chest bone, collarbone, and top of the abdomen.Squeeze the nipple and check for lumps and discharge.Repeat all of these steps for the left breast.Symptoms to look out for Many people with breast cancer experience no symptoms. In some cases, however, changes may start to occur from an early stage. People should speak with a doctor about their screening plan if they have any concerns.It is also worth noting that not all breast lumps are breast cancer, and not every case of breast cancer involves a lump. For these reasons, people should attend regular screenings as their doctor recommends.»Discover:The signs of breast cancerChecking the breastBreast changes that may indicate cancer include:a lump or thickening in the breast tissuean unexplained change in breast shapechanges in skin colorunusual breast shrinkage or swellingdimpling or puckering of the skin, or enlarged poresskin that has become irritated, scaly, or ridgeda thickening of the breast skinpain or a burning sensationChecking the nipplesSome changes to look for in the nipples and areolae include:changes in skin colorwarmth or swellingthe nipple turning inwarda scaly or ridged texture to the skindischarge that could be clear, milky, or yellow or contain bloodtenderness or painChecking the lymph nodesIn the early stages, breast cancer can cause changes in the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small organs that play a crucial role in the immune system. There are many throughout the body, and the closest to the breasts are in a person’s armpits.To check the lymph nodes, look for: a lump, swelling, or thickening around the underarma lump or swelling in the collarbone areaa thickening of the skin in the armpitLymph node involvement can also result in a rash on the breast in people with inflammatory breast cancer.A person should contact a doctor about these or any other unexplained changes, especially if they only seem to affect one breast.»Learn more:Early symptoms of breast cancerLymph nodes, breast cancer, and COVID-19 vaccinesIt is worth noting that breast cancer is not the only reason for lymph node swelling under the arm.The lymph nodes play a role in the body’s immune response, and swelling can occur after an infection, in response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine, or due to autoimmune conditions.However, if a person has concerns about possible symptoms of breast cancer, they should not hesitate to contact a doctor. They should also not delay having a COVID-19 vaccine. This is because if cancer is present, they may benefit from the extra protection a vaccine offers.»Read more:Breast cancer and COVID-19When to do the examAlthough the ACS does not currently recommend regular breast self-exams as part of breast cancer screening, BreastCancer.org recommends checking the breasts once per month at the same time each month. Before menopause, it is best to do the self-exam a few days after menstruation ends. At this time, the breasts are least likely to be swollen or sore. After menopause, a person might decide to check, for example, on the first day of each month.The normal texture and appearance of breasts can vary among individuals. Certain areas might feel sandy or grainy, and others might have small lumps. Not all breast lumps are cancerous.Routine self-exams help people develop a sense of what is normal for them and make it easier to spot any changes that might occur.SummaryThe ACS no longer recommends breast self-exams or physical exams by a doctor as a diagnostic tool, as there is a risk of false-positive or false-negative results. Many breast lumps are not cancerous, and finding them can lead to unnecessary anxiety.However, if a person is familiar with how their breasts usually look and feel, they are more likely to be able to spot changes at an early stage. If cancer is present, an early diagnosis can mean that treatment is more effective.A self-exam is not a diagnostic tool. People should follow a doctor’s advice on mammogram screening to ensure that they have the best chance of finding any changes as early as possible. Breast CancerCancer / OncologyHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
