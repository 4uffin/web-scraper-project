Updated on September 6, 2023What is the diet?Who can it help?Foods to eatFoods to limitDiet tipsFAQsTakeawayEating less processed food, alcohol, and red meat and consuming more plant-based foods may help manage inflammation in some instances.Anti-inflammatory diets are typically not specific regimens but rather eating styles. The Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet are examples of anti-inflammatory diets.Dietary changes may help manage both short- and long-term inflammation in many cases, although its efficacy as a management tool will depend on a person’s overall health and the causes of inflammation. For example, chronic inflammation can occur due to psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma. While diet changes may help manage some symptoms, it may not be effective in more severe cases.What is an anti-inflammatory diet?Share on PinterestThomas Barwick/Getty ImagesSome foods contain ingredients that can trigger or worsen inflammation. Meanwhile, other foods contain compounds – such as antioxidants – that may, in fact, reduce it.The role of antioxidantsAn anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fresh fruits and vegetables, which are often good sources of antioxidants.Dietary antioxidants are molecules in food that help remove free radicals from the body.Free radicals are the natural byproducts of some bodily processes, including metabolism. Free radicals can lead to cell damage. This damage increases the risk of inflammation and can contribute to various diseases.An anti-inflammatory diet favors foods that are rich in antioxidants over those that increase the production of free radicals.Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present in oily fish, may help reduce the levels of inflammatory proteins in the body. Fiber can also have this effect.Types of anti-inflammatory dietMany popular diets already adhere to anti-inflammatory principles. For example, both the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet include fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fats that are good for the heart.For example, research suggests that the Mediterranean diet, focusing on plant-based foods and healthful oils, can reduce the effects of inflammation on the cardiovascular system.Learn more about the Mediterranean diet here.Research also shows that the DASH diet can have a positive impact on reducing inflammation markers compared to regular diets. The DASH diet may also have additional benefits in inflammatory arthritis conditions, such as lowering uric acid levels, which are a risk factor for gout.Who can it help?An anti-inflammatory diet may serve as a complementary therapy for many conditions that become worse with chronic inflammation.The following conditions involve inflammation:rheumatoid arthritispsoriasisasthmaesophagitisCrohn’s diseasecolitisinflammatory bowel disease (IBD)lupusHashimoto’s thyroiditistype 2 diabetesobesityhigh blood pressurecardiovascular disease.Eating a diet that is rich in antioxidants may also help reduce the risk of certain cancers.Foods to eatAn anti-inflammatory diet should combine a variety of foods that:are rich in nutrientsprovide a range of antioxidantscontain healthful fatsFoods that may help manage inflammation include:oily fish, such as tuna and salmonfruits, such as blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and cherriesvegetables, including kale, spinach, and broccolibeansnuts and seedsolives and olive oilfiberThe authors of a 2017 article also recommended the following:raw or moderately cooked vegetableslegumes, such as lentilsspices, such as ginger and turmericprobiotics and prebioticsteasome herbsIt is worth remembering that no single food will boost a person’s health.

Common intolerances include:glutendairynightshade vegetablescruciferous vegetablesCan a vegetarian diet reduce inflammation?A vegetarian or vegan diet may be one option for people looking to reduce inflammation as these diets typically priortize natural, whole foods while reducing saturated fat intake.For exmaple, a 2017 analysis found that people who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet for 2 years or more typically have lower inflammatory biomarkers than those that eat meat.However, large, controlled studies into the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of vegan and vegetarian diets are lacking, and further research is neccesary to fully explore their positive effects.Get some tips on switching to a plant-based diet here.Anti-inflammatory diet tipsIt can be challenging to transition to a new way of eating, but the following tips may help:Pick up a variety of fruits, vegetables, and healthful snacks during the weekly shop.Gradually replace fast food meals with healthful, homemade lunches.Replace soda and other sugary beverages with still or sparkling mineral water.Other tips include:Talking to a healthcare professional about supplements, such as cod liver oil or a multivitamin.Incorporating 30 minutes of moderate exercise into the daily routine.Practicing good sleep hygiene, as poor sleep can worsen inflammation.Frequently asked questionsBelow are frequently asked questions relating to diet and inflammation.What do you eat on an anti-inflammatory diet?Anti-inflammatory diets typically prioritize, whole fruits, vegetables, and grains, while limiting processed food, alcohol, and red meat.What is the fastest way to reduce inflammation in the body?No food will immediately reduce inflammation in the body when someone eats it. However, eating a balanced, broad diet of whole foods and grains is proven to reduce inflammatory markers as part of a balanced lifestyle.What are the worst foods for inflammation?The ‘worst’ foods for inflammation will depend on a person’s specific tolerances, diet habits, and overall health status. However, highly processed foods items high in sugar, saturated fats, and salt, and alcohol are common causes of inflammation via diet.TakeawayAn anti-inflammatory diet may help reduce inflammation and improve symptoms of some common health conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis.There is no single anti-inflammatory diet, but a diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats may help manage inflammation.vAnyone who has a chronic health condition that involves inflammation should ask a healthcare professional about the best dietary options for them. PsoriasisRespiratoryRheumatologyNutrition / DietHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
