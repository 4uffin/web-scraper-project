Treatment typically depends on the cause, but medications and diet changes may help.Stomach aches are a common complaint. While many issues responsible for upper stomach pain, such as gas or a stomach virus, are not cause for concern, others may require medical treatment.In this article, learn about ten possible causes of upper stomach pain, as well as treatment options and when to see a doctor.GasShare on PinterestJohnce/Getty ImagesGas occurs naturally in the intestines and digestive tract. When this gas accumulates, it can cause feelings of pressure, bloating, or fullness.Gas usually goes away without treatment once it passes. If it does not pass on its own, over-the-counter (OTC) medications can help. A person can also try eating more slowly to avoid swallowing air and prevent the gas from getting worse. Some people notice that certain foods are more likely to cause gas pain and reduce their intake.IndigestionThe medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. It appears when there is too much acid in the stomach. It can cause a burning feeling in the upper stomach and sometimes in the mouth or throat. The pain may also feel like it stems from the chest.OTC medicines, such as antacids, are highly effective at managing temporary indigestion. Identifying the triggers, such as certain foods, can help a person make beneficial lifestyle changes.Sometimes, frequent indigestion is a sign of an underlying condition, such as a stomach ulcer or even cancer. If this symptom keeps coming back, speak with a doctor.GastritisAcute gastritis is a short-term condition that can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. It often occurs due to an infection.Causes of chronic or long-term gastritis include:Crohn’s diseaseautoimmune diseasessarcoidosisallergieschronic infectionsalcohol consumptionnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsAntibiotics can usually treat bacterial infections. When gastritis is chronic, diagnosing and treating the underlying cause can help.Stomach virusesGastroenteritis is the result of an infection that causes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, in addition to stomach pain. Some people call gastroenteritis the stomach flu, but it is not actually a type of flu.For most people, gastroenteritis is not serious and the symptoms go away on their own within a few days. It is vital to avoid dehydration, so consider drinking something that restores electrolytes until the symptoms pass.Muscle painMany muscles extend to the upper stomach. Pain from a mild muscle injury or spasms can cause temporary pain in the upper abdomen.Mild pain can get better with gentle massage and rest. Some people also find relief by using cold and hot packs.AppendicitisAppendicitis is an infection of the appendix. Without treatment, it can cause the appendix to rupture, and the condition can become life-threatening. People with symptoms need immediate medical attention.In the early stages of appendicitis, a person may notice a dull ache around their belly button, but this pain can radiate to the upper stomach. As the infection gets worse, the pain moves to the lower-right side.GallstonesGallstones are hard formations of cholesterol or bilirubin that can develop in the gallbladder. They do not always cause problems, but sometimes they block a biliary duct.A blockage from a gallstone can cause intense pain in the upper-right stomach, as well as vomiting, fatigue, and exhaustion.In some cases, surgery is necessary to resolve problems from gallstones. For example, if gallstones block the cystic duct, then a doctor will remove the gallbladder.If gallstones block the common bile duct, then an endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography may be necessary to help extract them. This involves inserting a thin camera and other implements down the throat to manipulate and resolve the blockage.Liver or pancreas conditionsThe liver, pancreas, and gallbladder work together to support digestion. All three organs are in the upper-right side of the stomach.Sometimes, untreated gallstones block biliary ducts, causing pain in the liver or pancreas.Liver diseases, such as hepatitis, can cause liver pain. Pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas, may also cause pain. Occasionally, the cause could be cancer.The right treatment depends on the underlying cause. People with pancreatitis may need to stay in the hospital for fluids and observation. Liver diseases require medication, and a liver transplant can treat advanced liver disease.Diverticular diseaseSmall pouches called diverticula can appear in the intestines, especially in the colon. The presence of these pouches is known as diverticulosis.When these pouches become inflamed or infected, a person can develop intense abdominal pain. Inflammation of the diverticular is known as diverticulitis.The location of the pain depends on where the diverticula are. While diverticula are more common in the lower intestines, they can also appear in the upper intestines, causing pain in the upper stomach.Probiotics and a high fiber diet often help treat diverticulitis. Antibiotics have been traditionally used to treat diverticulitis, but emerging recommendations suggest supportive care only in uncomplicated diverticulitisIf the infection worsens or does not go away, a doctor may perform surgery to remove the diverticula or a part of the intestines.Bowel obstructionA bowel obstruction blocks the intestines, making it difficult or impossible for anything to pass through. This can cause intense pain, constipation, and difficulty digesting and absorbing food.A bowel obstruction is a medical emergency, as the bowel can tear or become seriously infected. Medications, fluid, and pain relievers often help. In some cases, a surgeon may need to remove the blockage.When to contact a doctorIf stomach pain does not get better after a few days, or it keeps coming back, people should speak with a doctor.Contact a doctor promptly if:stomach pain keeps getting worseabdominal pain occurs following an injury, such as a blow to the stomachthere is a fever along with abdominal painurinating is painful or much more or less frequenta person is losing weight without tryingvomiting or diarrhea lasts more than a few daysa person has a weakened immune systemabdominal pain occurs after taking a new medicationGo to the emergency room if a person has:severe painpain in the upper-right abdomenvomited blood, or vomit that looks like coffee groundsthere is blood in the stool, or it looks tarry and blackextreme difficulty urinating, having a bowel movement, or passing gassigns of severe dehydration, such as not urinating, chapped lips, dry skin, confusion, dizziness, or sunken eyesstomach pain in pregnancySeek immediate help for any infant with a fever, or persistent vomiting or diarrhea.FAQBelow are frequently asked questions about the causes of abdominal pain.What does upper gastric pain feel like?Different causes of upper gastric pain produce different symptoms.
