There is no single ideal weight for all individuals. While various tools and calculators offer a guide, they may not be accurate in all cases.A note about sex and genderSex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Learn more.Tools to calculate a moderate weight range rely on factors such as age, height, and sex assigned at birth. However, everybody is different, and no single formula can determine a person’s ideal weight. No one measure of body size can tell a person their exact health status or potential health risks. Eating a nutritious, balanced diet, exercising, and other lifestyle habits can support improved health regardless of a person’s weight.There is some disagreement among medical experts about the usefulness of tools such as body mass index (BMI). These tools are not exact, and not everyone with excess weight will develop health issues. However, some researchers believe people with obesity who have no other health conditions are still at increased risk for developing obesity-linked conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease, in the long term.People who want to learn more about their current health status, future risks, and ways to improve health can benefit from speaking with their doctor. Read on to discover several tools that help estimate a person’s moderate weight range. Body mass index (BMI)Share on PinterestAttila Csomor/EyeEm/Getty ImagesBMI is a common tool that measures a person’s weight in relation to their height. A BMI calculation provides a single number, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categorizes as follows:A BMI of less than 18.5 suggests underweight.A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 suggests a healthy weight range.A BMI of between 25 and 29.9 may indicate overweight.A BMI of 30 or higher may indicate obesity.However, the CDC also notes that BMI does not assess an individual’s body composition or health. It is a screening tool that people should use alongside other tests and assessments to determine potential health risks. Body mass index calculatorA person can use BMI calculators or review the charts below to calculate BMI.What is the recommended weight for my height?The following weight and height chart uses BMI tables from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to provide a general guideline for categories of moderate (“normal”) weight, overweight, obesity, and severe obesity.

A person can talk with their doctor if they have questions about calculating or interpreting their BMI score. BMI based on ageAge is not a factor in BMI for adults, but it is for children. This is because children typically grow larger with age. The CDC uses both age and sex assigned at birth in its BMI calculations for people between the ages of 2–19 years. To calculate a child’s BMI, a person can use the CDC’s calculator for children and teenagers. The CDC’s BMI charts for children use percentiles that compare measurements with boys and girls of the same age and gender. If a person has questions about their child’s BMI, they should consult a doctor.What is the problem with BMI?BMI is a very basic measurement. While it takes height and weight into consideration, it does not account for factors such as:waist or hip measurementsthe proportion or distribution of fatthe proportion of muscle massThese factors can affect health. For example, high-performance athletes tend to have a lot of muscle and little body fat. They can have a high BMI because they have more muscle mass, but this does not mean they weigh too much for their height.Another limitation of BMI is that it does not distinguish between people of different racial or ethnic groups. Indeed, a 2021 study found significant racial disparities in BMI and body fat distribution.For example, non-Hispanic Black women were found to have higher BMI but lower levels of liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This suggests that non-Hispanic Black women may have a different, potentially healthier fat distribution compared to other groups.This inaccuracy may lead to a misdiagnosis or an incorrect assessment of risk factors between individuals.BMI can offer a rough idea of whether or not a person is at a moderate weight, and it is useful for measuring trends in population studies.However, it should not be the only measure an individual uses to assess whether their weight is ideal.Learn more about the limitations of BMI.Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)A person’s WHR compares their waist size with that of their hips. A high WHR is associated with higher levels of visceral fat, the fat in the abdominal cavity that surrounds several major organs.For this reason, the WHR can be a useful tool for understanding potential health risks when considered alongside other assessments of health status.A 2018 meta-analysis suggests that having a high WHR can put people at a higher risk of myocardial infarction, or heart attack.Measuring WHRTo calculate their WHR, a person should measure around their waist at the narrowest part, usually just above the belly button. They can then divide this measurement by the width of their hip at its widest part.For example, if a person’s waist is 28 inches (in) and their hips are 36 in, they will divide 28 by 36, giving a WHR of 0.77.What does it mean?Using WHR, a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) report defines abdominal obesity as follows:In males: WHR over 0.9In females: WHR over 0.85However, as with BMI, the WHR does have limitations. For example, this measure does not account for a person’s total body fat percentage or their muscle-to-fat ratio accurately. Optimal WHR differs based on sex assigned at birth as well as race and ethnicity, according to the 2008 WHO report.Plus, body size is not a direct measure of health. Anyone assessing body size needs to take a person’s overall health status into consideration.

It compares a person’s waist circumference to their height.According to 2015 research, higher WtHR has associations with worse cholesterol and blood pressure, even at a healthy BMI. For this reason, WtHR may be helpful when assessing health risks when used along with other measures of health.Measuring WtHRTo calculate WtHR, divide waist size by height. If the result is 0.5 or less, that is considered moderate.Measurements that take waist size into account can help to provide insight into an individual’s health risks.A 2023 study analyzed data from 20 studies and found that higher WHtR levels significantly increased the risk of all-cause mortality by 23% and cardiovascular mortality by 39%.While population-level studies are important, individual health is about more than waist size alone. A person should talk with their doctor if they have concerns about the health risks that may have links to a higher WtHR.Learn how to measure the waist.Body fat percentageBody fat percentage is the weight of a person’s fat divided by their total weight. This includes fat found in many different parts of the body. Body fat is necessary for the human body to function. An individual needs a type called essential fat to survive — it is critical for the development of the brain, bone marrow, nerves, and membranes.Other types of fat protect the internal organs in the chest and abdomen, and the body can use it if necessary for energy.RecommendationsApart from the approximate guidelines for males and females, the ideal total fat percentage can depend on a person’s body type or activity level.Typically, obesity is associated with a high proportion of body fat. Obesity and overweight can carry a greater risk for conditions such as:diabetesheart diseasehigh blood pressurestrokeCalculating body fat percentage can provide useful information because it reflects body composition, unlike BMI, WHR, and WtHR.Learn more about body fat levels by age and sex.How to measure body fatOne way to measure body fat percentage is to use a skinfold measurement, which uses special calipers to pinch the skin.A health professional will measure tissue on the thigh, abdomen, and chest for males or the upper arm for females.Other measures includehydrostatic body fat measuring, or underwater weighingair densitometry, which measures air displacementdual-energy X-ray absorptiometrybioelectrical impedance analysisWhile none of these can give a completely accurate reading, the estimates can be close enough to offer a reasonable assessment.Learn more about the different ways to measure body fat.Frequently asked questions Below are some commonly asked questions about weight, height, and age.How much should you weigh for your age?Body mass index (BMI) measurements do not take into account a person’s age. Therefore, based on BMI, it is not possible to suggest an ideal weight for a person’s age.Rather, a person’s ideal BMI is based on their weight and height.How do I determine my ideal weight?One method a person can use to determine their ideal weight is body mass index (BMI) measurements. This involves dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters) to arrive at a BMI score. What is a good weight for a 5′ 4″ female?According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a good weight for a person who is 5 foot (ft) 4 inches (in) tall ranges from 110–140 pounds (lbs). SummaryAn ideal body weight can mean different things to different people.BMI, WHR, WtHR, and body-fat percentage are four ways of assessing weight status. Combining results from them may be the best way to get an accurate idea of whether a person’s body size is considered moderate.However, body size alone does not offer a complete picture of a person’s health. Anyone with concerns about their weight, waist size, or body composition should speak with a doctor about their individual health and how to manage any potential risk factors. DiabetesHypertensionCardiovascular / CardiologyObesity / Weight Loss / FitnessHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
