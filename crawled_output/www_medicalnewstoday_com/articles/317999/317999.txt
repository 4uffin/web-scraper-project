It is a very broad medical term. Rashes can vary widely in appearance. Their causes range from insect bites to HIV and reactions to medications. A rash can affect one part of the body or cover a large area. Rashes can also be dry, moist, bumpy, smooth, cracked, or blistered. They can involve pain, itching, and color changes. Some rashes will clear up on their own, some respond to home remedies, but others might be a sign of something more serious that needs medical attention. Rashes can happen for many reasons, including skin infections, allergies, and medications. They can also result from bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections and other diseases.In this article, we detail 71 possible causes of a rash sectioned by cause, and accompanied with images.Allergic or sensitivity reactionsShare on PinterestDesign by MNT; Photography by Healthline/Getty Images & MajaMitrovic/Getty ImagesAllergies and sensitivities to food and other substances can cause skin rashes. One of the most common causes of rashes — contact dermatitis — occurs when the skin has a reaction to something that it has touched. The skin may become inflamed, and the rash tends to be weepy and oozy. Common causes include:dyes in clothesbeauty productspoisonous plants, such as poison ivy and sumacchemicals, such as latex or rubberA food allergy can also cause a rash and other symptoms. Hives (urticaria) are a type of rash that often occurs with an allergic or sensitivity reaction. Pruritus is an itchy rash. Hives appear as raised bumps, but on lighter skin, they may also be pink or reddish. On darker skin tones, it may appear as raised bumps or welts, darker than the surrounding area, or with a reddish, or purple hue.An allergy can also cause swelling, breathing problems, and other symptoms. This may be a sign of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that needs urgent medical attention. It can be life threatening.Anaphylaxis: Symptoms and what to doAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life threatening. The symptoms develop suddenly and include:hivesswelling of the face or mouthwheezingfast, shallow breathinga fast heart rateclammy skinanxiety or confusiondizzinessvomitingblue or white lipsfainting or loss of consciousnessIf someone has these symptoms:Check whether they are carrying an epinephrine pen. If they are, follow the instructions on the side of the pen to use it.Dial 911 or the number of the nearest emergency department.Assist the person in moving from a sitting position to lying down. If they have vomited, turn them onto their side.Stay with them until the emergency services arrive.Some people may need more than one epinephrine injection. If the symptoms do not improve in 5 to 15 minutes, or they come back, use a second pen if the person has one.The following slides show pictures of rashes due to contact dermatitis, a hay fever rash, and other allergic and sensitivity reactions.

Some medications, including certain antibiotics, can also cause photophobia or photosensitivity. This means they make the individual more susceptible to sunlight. The photosensitivity reaction looks similar to a sunburn.In an allergic reaction, a person’s immune system mistakenly attacks the medication as if it were a pathogen. Symptoms vary depending on the individual and the drug, but can include:a rash, including hivesitchy skin or eyesswellingAnyone who experiences a drug reaction should contact their doctor. They may need to change the dose or the drug. If a person has severe symptoms or finds it difficult to breathe, they should call 911 immediately or go straight to the emergency room.The images in the slideshow below show some ways medications, vaccines, and allergy testing might affect the skin.Bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections Infections that involve bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites can also cause a rash. These rashes will vary depending on the type of infection. For instance, candidiasis, a common fungal infection, causes an itchy rash that generally appears in skin folds.Anyone who believes they may have an infection should seek medical advice.
