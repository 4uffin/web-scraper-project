Other symptoms include fatigue, jaw pain, and tender temples.Trigeminal neuralgia: This causes intense pain in the face and head. The pain usually affects only one side at a time.

This predisposes them to headaches occurring only on the one side.Bilateral conditionsOccipital neuralgia typically affects both sides of the head, but can cause one-sided symptoms.
