And how can we break down such lifestyle changes into manageable steps? In this podcast episode, Medical News Today shares three actionable resolutions that can help improve your health in the new year.

Illustration by Andrew Nguyen for Medical News TodayAs humans, we are all capable of growth and change. And perhaps, one of the most influential times of the year for transformation and setting the stage for change is New Year’s.When it comes to making resolutions for health or any other area of life, we may set unrealistic or very large goals that set us up for failure from the start. The key, according to experts, is to start small and be as specific as possible—whether that be via setting a time frame or measurable results.In our August 2023 podcast episode, we had touched on how human behavior inherently resists change unless the optimal conditions are present. One such factor was whether it would be beneficial.Medical News Today has covered many important pieces of research this year that showed how certain habits and practices could improve overall health.The top areas of research in this regard were brain and heart health, nutrition, exercise, and sleep.So, what did the most significant studies from 2024 find?Based on research earlier this year, researchers found that experiencing disrupted sleep in ages 30–40 may lead to memory problems later in life. They also linked a lack of quality sleep to accelerated brain aging.On the topic of exercise, scientists found that any form of exercise could help rejuvenate the brain, and a particular type of activity could even prolong life span. Another study also found increased heart failure and death risk from being sedentary for a certain number of hours a day.To ensure a healthy and balanced diet, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) also published a new report this year, listing the food groups people should consume more and others to avoid for optimal health. It also touched on how many carbs and what types of fats to include in one’s diet.In our final podcast episode of 2024, we discussed all this and more. We also included tips on getting better sleep at night, following a healthful diet, and incorporating more exercise into one’s daily life.
