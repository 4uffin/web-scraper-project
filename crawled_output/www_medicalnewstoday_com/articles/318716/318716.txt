Getting more exercise helps reduce it even further.Eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich in potassium, can help lower blood pressure. Be sure to discuss a potassium-rich diet with your doctor before starting, especially if you are taking blood pressure medication.Both meditation and deep breathing can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps slow your heart rate and lower blood pressure.High blood pressure affects nearly half of American adults and 1.28 billion people worldwide. If left uncontrolled, high blood pressure raises your risk of heart disease and stroke.However, there are a number of things you can do to lower your blood pressure naturally, even without medication.Here are 15 natural ways to treat high blood pressure.1. Walk and exercise regularlyShare on PinterestImage credit: FatCamera/Getty ImagesExercise is one of the best things you can do to lower high blood pressure.Regular exercise helps make your heart stronger and more efficient at pumping blood, which lowers the pressure in your arteries.In fact, getting 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise, such as walking, or 75 minutes per week of vigorous exercise, such as running, can help lower blood pressure and improve heart health.Bottom lineWalking for just 30 minutes a day can help lower your blood pressure. Getting more exercise helps reduce it even further.»MORE:Get a refill for your high blood pressure medication in as little as 15 minutes with Optum Now Online Care.Optum Now is operated by RVO Health.

This is largely due to increased consumption of processed and prepared foods. Many studies have linked high salt intake with high blood pressure and heart events, including stroke.If a person already has high blood pressure, it’s worth cutting back your sodium intake to see whether it makes a difference. Swap processed foods such as canned vegetables for fresh ingredients and try seasoning with herbs and spices rather than salt.Bottom lineMost guidelines for lowering blood pressure recommend reducing sodium intake. However, that recommendation might make the most sense for people who are sensitive to the effects of salt.3. Drink less alcoholDrinking alcohol can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of several chronic health conditions.While some research has suggested that low to moderate amounts of alcohol consumption may protect the heart, those benefits may be offset by negative effects.In the United States, moderate alcohol consumption is defined as no more than one drink per day for females and two drinks per day for males. If you drink more than that, it might be best to consider reducing your intake.Bottom lineDrinking any amount of alcohol may raise your blood pressure. Therefore, it’s best to moderate your intake.4. Eat more potassium-rich foodsPotassium is an important mineral that helps your body get rid of sodium and eases pressure on your blood vessels. Modern diets have increased most people’s sodium intake while decreasing potassium intake.To get a better balance of potassium and sodium in your diet, focus on eating fewer processed foods and more fresh, whole foods.Foods that are particularly high in potassium include:vegetables, especially leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, and sweet potatoesfruit, including melons, bananas, avocados, oranges, and apricotsdairy, such as milk and yogurttuna and salmonnuts and seedsbeansBottom lineEating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are rich in potassium, can help lower blood pressure.A person may want to discuss a potassium-rich diet with their doctor prior to starting. There are some blood pressure medicines that inherently increase the potassium in the body. If you pair these with a high-potassium diet, then the level may get too high, which can be dangerous.5. Cut back on caffeineIf you’ve ever downed a cup of coffee before you’ve had your blood pressure taken, you’ll know that caffeine causes an instant blood pressure boost. However, there’s not much evidence to suggest that drinking caffeine regularly can cause a lasting increase.In fact, people who drink caffeinated coffee or tea tend to have a lower risk of heart disease, including high blood pressure, than those who do not drink it.Still, if you suspect you’re sensitive to the effects of caffeine, consider cutting back to see whether it lowers your blood pressure.Bottom lineCaffeine can cause a short-term spike in blood pressure. However, for many people, it does not cause a lasting increase.6. Learn to manage stressStress is a key driver of high blood pressure.When you’re chronically stressed, your body is in a constant fight-or-flight mode. On a physical level, that means a faster heart rate and constricted blood vessels.When you experience stress, you might also be more likely to engage in habits that can have negative effects on blood pressure, such as drinking alcohol and eating processed foods.Bottom lineChronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Finding ways to manage stress can help.7. Eat dark chocolate or cocoaWhile eating massive amounts of dark chocolate probably won’t help your heart, small amounts may.That’s because dark chocolate and cocoa powder are rich in flavonoids, which are plant compounds that cause blood vessels to dilate.A 2017 review found that flavonoid-rich cocoa may reduce short-term blood pressure levels in healthy adults.For the strongest effects, use non-alkalized cocoa powder, which is especially high in flavonoids and has no added sugars.Bottom lineDark chocolate and cocoa powder contain plant compounds that help relax blood vessels, which may lower blood pressure.8. Try to lose weight, if necessaryIn people who are overweight, losing weight can make a big difference to heart health. Studies show that in people with obesity losing just 5% of their body weight had significant benefits for blood pressureThe effect can be even greater when weight loss is paired with other lifestyle changes, such as exercise.Losing weight can help your blood vessels do a better job of expanding and contracting, making it easier for the left ventricle of your heart to pump blood.Bottom lineLosing weight can significantly lower high blood pressure. This effect is even more pronounced when you exercise.9. If you smoke, consider quittingAmong the many reasons to quit smoking is that the habit is a strong risk factor for heart disease.Every puff of cigarette smoke causes a slight, temporary increase in blood pressure. The chemicals in tobacco are also known to damage blood vessels.However, studies haven’t found a conclusive link between smoking and high blood pressure. This could be because people who smoke regularly develop a tolerance over time.Still, since both smoking and high blood pressure raise the risk of heart disease, quitting smoking can help lessen that risk.Bottom lineThough there’s conflicting research about smoking and high blood pressure, both increase the risk of heart disease.10. Cut added sugar and refined carbsThere’s a growing body of research showing a link between added sugar intake and high blood pressure.A 2020 research review found that increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to higher blood pressure levels in children and adolescents.And it’s not just sugar — all refined carbs, such as the kind found in white flour, convert rapidly to sugar in your bloodstream and could cause problems.Some studies have shown that low carb diets may also help reduce blood pressure.In fact, one review of 12 studies showed that following a low carb diet could reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure, along with several other risk factors for heart disease.Bottom lineConsuming refined carbs, especially sugar, may raise blood pressure. Some studies have shown that low carb diets may help lower your blood pressure levels.11. Eat berriesBerries are full of more than just juicy flavor. They’re also packed with polyphenols, natural plant compounds that are good for your heart.Polyphenols can reduce the risk of stroke, heart conditions, and diabetes and improve blood pressure, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation.Bottom lineBerries are rich in polyphenols, which can help lower blood pressure and the overall risk of heart disease.12. Try meditation or deep breathingWhile these two behaviors could also fall under “stress reduction techniques,” meditation and deep breathing deserve specific mention.Both meditation and deep breathing may activate the parasympathetic nervous system. This system is engaged when the body relaxes, slowing the heart rate and lowering blood pressure.Studies show that different styles of meditation appear to have benefits for lowering blood pressure.Deep breathing techniques can also be quite effective.The authors of a 2021 review concluded that practicing diaphragmatic breathing, a deep breathing technique, twice daily for 4 weeks could lead to a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.Bottom lineBoth meditation and deep breathing can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which helps slow your heart rate and lower blood pressure.13. Eat calcium-rich foodsPeople with low calcium intake often have high blood pressure.While calcium supplements haven’t been conclusively shown to lower blood pressure, calcium-rich diets do seem to be linked to healthy blood pressure levels.For most adults, the calcium recommendation is 1,000 milligrams (mg) per day. However, some people, including older adults, may need more.In addition to dairy, you can get calcium from collard greens and other leafy greens, beans, sardines, and tofu. Here is a list of calcium-rich plant-based foods.Bottom lineCalcium-rich diets are linked to healthy blood pressure levels. You can get calcium by eating dark leafy greens, tofu, and dairy products.14. Take natural supplementsSome natural supplements may also help lower blood pressure. Here are some of the main supplements that have evidence behind them:Aged garlic extract: Researchers have used aged garlic extract successfully as a stand-alone treatment and along with conventional therapies for lowering blood pressure.Berberine: Though more research is needed, some studies have found that berberine could potentially help lower blood pressure levels.Fish oil: Long credited with improving heart health, fish oil may benefit people with high blood pressure.Bottom lineResearchers have investigated several natural supplements for their ability to lower blood pressure.»Read more:Supplements for high blood pressure15. Eat foods rich in magnesiumMagnesium is an important mineral that helps blood vessels relax.While magnesium deficiency is pretty rare, many people don’t get enough magnesium in their diet.Some studies have suggested that getting too little magnesium is linked with high blood pressure, but evidence from clinical studies has been less clear.Still, you can ensure that you’re meeting your needs by enjoying a variety of magnesium-rich foods, such as vegetables, dairy products, legumes, chicken, beef, and whole grains.Bottom lineMagnesium is an essential mineral that helps regulate blood pressure. It can be found in a wide range of whole foods, including legumes and whole grains.Frequently asked questionsBelow are the answers to some frequently asked questions about lowering high blood pressure.What will bring blood pressure down quickly?Long-term lifestyle changes, such as reducing salt intake and managing stress, are the best way to bring blood pressure down.
