Updated on May 20, 2025Types of anxiety medicationOther anxiety medicationsSide effectsSuicide risk and antidepressantsHome remediesAlternativesSupportContacting a doctorFAQSummaryTypes of anxiety medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, and more.People with persistent anxiety may benefit from anxiety medications to help manage symptoms. A doctor can help decide on the most suitable option.This article discusses the main types of anxiety medication and lists their risks and side effects.What are the four main types of anti-anxiety medications?Share on PinterestMaksim Tarasov/StocksySeveral types of medication can treat the symptoms of anxiety. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) notes there are
of drugs for anxiety disorders.Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)Although SSRIs are a type of antidepressant, doctors can prescribe them to people with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).According to a 2022 article, doctors consider SSRIs to be the first-line drug treatment for generalized anxiety disorder.SSRIs stop nerve cells in the brain from reabsorbing serotonin, a chemical that plays a vital role in mood regulation.Examples of SSRIs for anxiety include:citalopram (Celexa)escitalopram (Lexapro)fluoxetine (Prozac)fluvoxamine (Luvox)paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva)sertraline (Zoloft)These medications typically begin to take effect within 2 to 6 weeks, but they may not work for everyone. People usually take SSRIs for 6 to 12 months to treat anxiety and then gradually reduce the dosage.These drugs are not habit-forming, meaning that they do not usually lead to dependence.People should consult a doctor or physician before they start reducing or stopping their medication.Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)SNRIs are another class of antidepressants that can treat depression and anxiety. Doctors may also prescribe them to treat some chronic pain conditions.The ADAA notes that medical professionals also consider SNRIs to be the first-line treatment for anxiety. However, they are not as effective in treating OCD.These medications work by reducing the brain’s reabsorption of the chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine.Examples of SNRIs for anxiety are:duloxetine (Cymbalta)venlafaxine (Effexor XR)As with SSRIs, SNRIs can take several weeks to have an effect.»Discover:The differences between SSRIs and SNRIsTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)TCAs are an older class of antidepressant. Although they may be effective for the treatment of depression and anxiety, doctors often prescribe SSRIs instead as they cause fewer adverse side effects.However, TCAs may be useful for some people, especially if other medications do not provide relief.These medications work by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin and norepinephrine. This increases the levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain.Examples of TCAs for anxiety include:amitriptyline (Elavil)imipramine (Tofranil)nortriptyline (Pamelor)BenzodiazepinesBenzodiazepines are a type of sedative that reduces the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tense muscles. These drugs also encourage relaxation, and their effects take place quickly. Peak levels in the blood occur 1 to 2 hours after a person takes their dose. People may feel the effects sooner than this.Benzodiazepines include:alprazolam (Xanax)chlordiazepoxide (Librium)diazepam (Valium)lorazepam (Ativan)Although they can be highly effective for short-term issues, doctors rarely prescribe benzodiazepines because they become less effective over time and can be addictive.Due to these risks, experts suggest that doctors do not prescribe the continuous use of benzodiazepines for more than 6 months.Some people may take benzodiazepines to manage short-term anxiety. For example, people with a fear of flying may take them before a flight.At times, people can take a benzodiazepine alongside an SSRI for 2 to 4 weeks until the SSRI takes effect.»Learn more:Benefits and risks of benzodiazepinesOther medications for anxietyMany other medications may help treat anxiety, although doctors usually only prescribe them if SSRIs or similar drugs do not work.Beta-blockersBeta-blockers are a common medication for people with high blood pressure and heart conditions. However, doctors may prescribe them off-label for anxiety in certain situations.Beta-blockers reduce the effects of norepinephrine, meaning that they can relieve some of the physical symptoms of anxiety. Examples of beta-blockers include atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal).BuspironeThis anti-anxiety medication may treat short- or long-term anxiety symptoms.Buspirone (BuSpar) works much more slowly than benzodiazepines and may not treat all types of anxiety disorders, but it causes fewer side effects and has a lower risk of dependency.Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)MAOIs are one of the earliest types of antidepressant. Doctors may prescribe them off-label to treat some types of anxiety, though they can potentially cause serious side effects, so doctors rarely prescribe them.Types of MAOI include:isocarboxazid (Marplan)phenelzine (Nardil)selegiline (Emsam)tranylcypromine (Parnate)Side effectsAntidepressants and other drugs for anxiety have the potential to cause side effects in some people. These often resolve after a few weeks, but it is crucial to contact a doctor if they are severe or do not subside.Some doctors may recommend taking anxiety medications with food to minimize side effects or taking them before bed if the drug does not interfere with sleep.The side effects a person experiences may vary depending on the type of medication.SSRIsThe side effects of SSRIs can include:nauseadiarrheaconstipationloss of appetiteblurry visiondizzinessdrowsiness or fatiguedry mouthfeeling agitated or restlessheadachessexual difficulties or erectile dysfunctionsleep problemsSNRIsThe side effects of SNRIs are similar to those of SSRIs, and can include:constipationdizzinessdrowsiness or fatiguedry mouthheadachesincreased blood pressureloss of appetitenauseasexual problems or erectile dysfunctionsleep problemssweating more than usualstomach achesTCAsSide effects vary among TCAs as they work in different ways.

Individuals with diabetes should take them with caution and speak with a doctor about the possible risks.BuspironeThe side effects of buspirone may include:blurry visiondiarrheadizzinessdrowsinessdry mouthfatigueheadachesmuscle painsnauseaconfusionrestlessness or nervousnesssleep problemssweatingweaknessMAOIsSome common side effects of MAOIs include:nauseadiarrheaconstipationdry mouthdizzinessdrowsinesslightheadednessinsomniaThese medications also interact with several other drugs, as well as some foods and drinks.
