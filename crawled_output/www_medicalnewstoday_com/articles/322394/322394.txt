Updated on May 7, 2025Natural cough remediesHow to prevent a coldHow to prevent coughingContacting a doctorFAQSummaryA number of home remedies, such as honey and saltwater, may help manage cough symptoms. If home remedies do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available.Allergies, infections, and acid reflux are just a few possible causes of a cough. There are many different ways to manage the symptoms of a cough, including natural remedies. While many of these remedies do not have full scientific backing, people may still find them useful. This article reviews natural remedies that may help treat a cough.Natural cough remediesShare on Pinterestpinstock/Getty ImagesIt is important to remember that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not monitor herbs and supplements, so people who use them may be at risk of using low quality products with impurities.People who want to try natural remedies to treat their cough should consider researching sources and brands. Additionally, some herbs and supplements can interfere with medications, which may result in unwanted side effects. It is best to consult a doctor before taking supplements.HoneySome people may find that honey can help alleviate a cough.In a 2021 review of studies, researchers looked at the effect of using honey to treat coughs in upper respiratory infections. The researchers found that honey was superior to usual care, both in suppressing the cough and in helping prevent the need for antibiotics.In another study, researchers compared honey with dextromethorphan, a common cough suppressant, finding that both can be effective in cough management.A person can use this remedy by swallowing a spoonful of honey or adding it to a hot drink, such as an herbal tea.Hot fluidsDrinking various warm drinks may provide symptom relief from coughs. Hot beverages that may be comforting include:clear brothsherbal teasdecaffeinated black teahot water with honey and gingerSteamA wet cough, which produces mucus or phlegm, may improve with steam.To try this method, a person should take a hot shower or bath and allow the bathroom to fill with steam. They should stay in this steam for a few minutes until symptoms subside. They can drink a glass of water afterward to cool down and prevent dehydration.While many believe steam will help with cough and other symptoms, not all evidence supports this. For example, a 2017 study looking at the use of steam for common cold symptoms found that it did not noticeably improve a person’s symptoms. Marshmallow rootMarshmallow root is an herb with a long history of use as a treatment for coughs and sore throats. However, current research into its efficacy is lacking. For example, the authors of a 2020 review concluded that marshmallow root extract alone, and as part of various herbal remedies, may have a positive effect on cough symptom management. However, the evidence cited included that from older, small, or animal studies. Further research is necessary to assess its efficacy in people.Marshmallow root is also available as a dried herb or a bagged tea. A person should add hot water and drink it immediately or allow it to cool first. The longer the marshmallow root steeps in the water, the more mucilage will be in the drinkSaltwater garglePeople have long used saltwater gargles to help alleviate sore throats and symptoms associated with the common cold. They may also help loosen mucus and alleviate some pain.A person can make a saltwater gargle by:stirring 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a cup of warm water until it dissolves allowing the solution to cool slightly before using it to gargleletting the mixture sit at the back of the throat for a few moments before spitting it outdoing this several times each day until the cough improvesBromelainBromelain is an enzyme that comes from pineapples. It is most plentiful in the core of the fruit.It has anti-inflammatory properties and may also have mucolytic properties, which means it can break down mucus and remove it from the body.Some people drink pineapple juice daily to reduce mucus in the throat and suppress coughing. However, there may not be enough bromelain in the juice to relieve symptoms.ThymeThyme has both culinary and medicinal uses and is a commonly used remedy for a cough, sore throat, bronchitis, and digestive issues.In a 2015 meta-analysis of several studies, researchers noted that strong evidence suggests that using thyme preparations helped alleviate people’s cough symptoms. However, they noted that additional studies are needed to demonstrate its overall effectiveness.A more recent study in 2021 showed that people using a combination of thyme and ivy drops showed improvement in bronchitis symptoms, cough, and overall quality of life. They also noted that people experienced few side effects using the drops.Dietary changes for acid refluxAcid reflux is a common cause of a cough. Avoiding foods that can trigger acid reflux is one of the best ways to manage this condition and reduce the cough that accompanies it.Every individual may have different reflux triggers that they need to avoid. People who are unsure of what causes their reflux can begin by eliminating the most common triggers from their diet and monitoring their symptoms.Common triggers of acid reflux include:alcoholcaffeinechocolatecitrus foodsfried and fatty foodsgarlic and onionsmintspices and spicy foodstomatoes and tomato-based products11. N-acetylcysteine (NAC)NAC is a supplement made from the amino acid L-cysteine. Reducing mucus in the airways may lessen the frequency and severity of a wet cough. People may use NAC in the treatment of chronic respiratory conditions such as chronic bronchitis, a prolonged inflammation of the airways that causes mucus buildup and a cough.NAC can have severe side effects, including hives, swelling, fever, and difficulty breathing. Anyone considering this approach should speak with a doctor first.Tips to help prevent a coldIt is not always possible to avoid getting a cold or other respiratory tract infection that can lead to a cough, but avoiding contact with people who are sick, regular handwashing, and staying hydrated can help reduce the risk.
