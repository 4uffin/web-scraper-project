Updated on August 20, 2025AboutHealthy rangesHypertensionHypotensionPreventionWhen to see a doctorSummaryKey takeaway Blood pressure readings indicate the force of blood against blood vessel walls, and understanding these numbers is crucial for monitoring heart health and overall well-being.Healthy blood pressure ranges for adults are categorized as normal, elevated, and various stages of hypertension, with the systolic number being a key indicator of heart disease risk for individuals over 50.Lifestyle modifications such as a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management can help maintain healthy blood pressure, while regular check-ups and home monitoring can aid in early detection and management of hypertension or hypotension.Keep reading for more information about blood pressure and blood pressure readings.What is blood pressure?Share on PinterestWestend61/Getty ImagesBlood pressure refers to the force that blood puts on the walls of the blood vessels as the heart pumps blood. Healthcare professionals measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).Doctors can use blood pressure as an indicator of a person’s heart health. People with high blood pressure (hypertension) are at risk of developing heart problems and damage to the walls of the blood vessels.Low blood pressure (hypotension) can be associated with underlying health conditions. However, some people have low blood pressure all the time, and that can be typical for them. If blood pressure falls too low, it can cause people to feel dizzy or light-headed. In severe cases, hypotension can compromise blood flow to the organs, increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke.»MORE:Get a refill for your high blood pressure medication in as little as 15 minutes with Optum Now Online Care.Optum Now is operated by RVO Health.

Systolic is the top number on the reading and is the higher one. Diastolic is the lower number.Although a doctor can use both numbers to diagnose high blood pressure, the systolic number can be a more significant indicator of a person’s risk for heart disease in those over 50.The following infographic outlines blood pressure ranges according to the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute:Share on PinterestThese numbers are for adults. A parent or caregiver should talk with a child’s doctor about healthy ranges for children, as age, weight, and sex can all affect these numbers.Risks of hypertensionIf a person has hypertension, their blood pressure is too high. When a person is hypertensive, they are at an increased risk of developing conditions, such as:heart attackheart failureheart diseaseatherosclerosis, which is a buildup of plaque in the arteriesstrokekidney failurekidney diseasevision losssexual dysfunctionIn most cases, there are no symptoms of high blood pressure. However, a person who is experiencing a hypertension crisis due to elevated blood pressure levels may experience the following symptoms:difficulty speakingchest painback painchange in vision or blurry visionshortness of breath due to fluid in the lungsnumbness or weaknessheadacheAnyone experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical treatment.Risks of hypotensionWhen a person has severe hypotension, their blood pressure is too low.Though many doctors often stress the importance of lowering blood pressure, it is possible for someone’s blood pressure to be too low.People with very low blood pressure may experience the following symptoms:faintingdizziness/lightheadednessnauseaheart palpitationsfatigueblurry visioninjury from falling or loss of consciousnessorgan damage in severe casesHow to maintain a healthy blood pressurePeople’s blood pressure is partially due to factors they cannot control, such as:agesexfamily historychronic kidney diseaseHowever, there are also many steps a person can take to prevent high blood pressure.

If the blood pressure reader indicates a person has high or low blood pressure, they should talk with their doctor.SummaryBlood pressure is one indicator of a person’s heart health. If the pressure is too high, it can lead to serious health complications and potentially death.Though not all causes of elevated blood pressure are preventable, a person can reduce their risk of complications by managing their lifestyle and minimizing risk factors for developing high blood pressure.Anyone concerned about high or low blood pressure should speak with a doctor. Heart DiseaseHypertensionPublic HealthBlood / HematologyHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.
