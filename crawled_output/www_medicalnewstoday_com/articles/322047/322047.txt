Updated on October 9, 2024Home remediesCausesPreventionContacting a doctorFAQSummarySeveral home remedies can help resolve stomach and abdominal pain, such as drinking water and avoiding spicy foods. If these do not help, over-the-counter and prescription medications are available.Stomach pain, also known as abdominal pain, belly ache, or stomach ache, describes discomfort that a person feels anywhere between their chest and groin. This pain can vary in intensity and affect different areas of the abdomen, such as the stomach, appendix, liver, bowel, and more.Stomach pain can also occur alongside other symptoms such as heartburn, bloating, and nausea. The correct remedy for a person’s stomach pain will depend on its cause.This article looks at 12 of the most popular home remedies for an upset stomach and indigestion. Share on PinterestMichela Ravasio/StocksyTwelve home remediesThere are several popular home remedies for indigestion. Some may also help ease stomach upset from other sources, such as irritable bowel syndrome.1. Drinking waterThe body needs water to efficiently digest and absorb nutrients from foods and beverages. Being dehydrated makes digestion more difficult and less effective, increasing the likelihood of an upset stomach.Additionally, drinking water may help reduce heartburn.The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics says that although the general rule of thumb is drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water daily, a person’s fluid needs can vary. Activity levels, elevation, extreme temperatures, general health, and size can all make a difference in fluid needs.2. Avoiding lying downAvoiding lying down may prevent indigestion from becoming heartburn. When the body is horizontal, the acid in the stomach is more likely to travel backward and move upward, which can cause heartburn.Therefore, people with an upset stomach should avoid lying down or going to bed for at least a few hours until it passes. 3. GingerGinger may help reduce nausea and vomiting in people who are pregnant or those who undergo chemotherapy.Individuals with an upset stomach could try adding ginger to their food or drinking it as tea. Some all-natural ginger ales may also contain enough ginger to settle an upset stomach. Ginger tea is widely available to buy in supermarkets and online. 4. BRAT dietDoctors may recommend the bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet to people with diarrhea. BRAT foods may decrease the number of stools a person passes and help ease their diarrhea.As these foods are bland, they do not contain substances that irritate the stomach, throat, or intestines. Therefore, this diet can soothe the tissue irritation resulting from the acids in vomit.Many of the foods in the BRAT diet are also high in nutrients, such as potassium and magnesium, and can replace those someone loses through diarrhea and vomiting.5. Avoiding smoking and drinking alcoholSmoking and alcohol may trigger indigestion and other gastrointestinal conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).Quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake also improves people’s quality of life and reduces the risk of certain health conditions, such as cancer. However, avoiding smoking and drinking alcohol can be difficult, and individuals may require extra support.Learn more about quitting smoking and drinking:Five ways to quit smoking11 tips for giving up smokingBest apps for quitting smokingHow long does it take to detox from alcohol?Best apps to stop drinking alcohol8 of the best alcohol support groups6. Avoiding difficult-to-digest foodsResearch suggests that the following foods may increase the risk of indigestion:fatty or acidic foodswheat productsspicy foodsgreasy foodsAvoiding difficult-to-digest foods may help ease the stomach and reduce discomfort and pain. However, avoiding heavily preserved foods may be more difficult for people who do not have the time to source fresher food or those who live in a food desert. Food deserts are regions where individuals have limited access to nutritious and affordable food7. Baking sodaSome healthcare professionals suggest that baking soda can help relieve heartburn and indigestion by reducing stomach acidity. While this home remedy may help with an upset stomach, it may not taste pleasant. Additionally, consuming too much baking soda may lead to:shallow or slow breathingmuscle twitchingmuscle spasmsdiarrheavomitingirritability8. FigsFigs, and several other fruits contain substances that act as laxatives to ease constipation and encourage healthy bowel movements. Figs also contain compounds that may help to ease indigestion.However, if people are also experiencing diarrhea, they should avoid consuming figs due to this food’s laxative effects.9. AloeAloe vera may help reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and colitis, although the evidence for these benefits is lacking and needs further research.Healthcare professionals state that drinking aloe vera juice can yield multiple benefits, including providing relief from the following symptoms of GERD:heartburnflatulence and belchingnausea and vomitingacid and food regurgitationHowever, ingesting aloe vera may cause abdominal pain and cramps.Aloe vera juice is widely available commercially.10. BasilBasil contains substances that may reduce gas. Its leaves also contain levels of high linoleic acid, which has anti-inflammatory properties.Basil is usually available to purchase in grocery stores, gardening stores, and online. However, those in food deserts may have to rely on online stores if they find it difficult to source fresh basil.11. LicoriceProducts that contain licorice root may help relieve digestive symptoms. However, experts are uncertain about the role of licorice in these products.Someone with an upset stomach could try drinking licorice root tea several times daily until their symptoms improve. Licorice root teas are widely available online, but it is possible to make them at home by mixing 1 or 2 teaspoons of licorice root powder with boiling water.However, licorice can cause side effects, such as an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in potassium levels. This may be especially dangerous for those with high blood pressure or kidney or heart disease.12. RicePlain rice may be beneficial for those with stomach pain due to irritable bowel syndrome or other conditions that can cause frequent diarrhea, along with other low FODMAP food.Rice is also part of the BRAT diet that doctors may recommend.However, there is some evidence that white rice consumption may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome. However, the risk may increase with regular or frequent consumption and may not affect those who consume white rice to help with stomach pain.What can cause stomach pain?Abdominal pain may be due to more common causes such as gas, indigestion, constipation, and diarrhea. Infectious illnesses, such as the flu, may also cause abdominal pain.More uncommon causes include:pneumoniamyocardial infarction, or heart attackstrangulated herniaperitonitis, an infection of the stomach liningbowel obstructionappendicitispancreatitiskidney stonesovarian cystsRead on to learn more about the causes of abdominal pain.Common allergies and intolerancesFood allergies and intolerances can cause stomach pain and bloating.
