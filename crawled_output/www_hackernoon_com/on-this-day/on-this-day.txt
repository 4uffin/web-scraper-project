The spacecraft was equipped with a suite of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and other sensors, that were designed to collect data on Mars from orbit.

The cable replaced the unreliable radio wave method and paved the way for further developments in underwater communication technologies, enabling efficient communication worldwide.Motorola Incorporation1928Motorola was incorporated on September 25, 1928, by the Galvin brothers, Paul and Joseph, in Chicago, Illinois.
