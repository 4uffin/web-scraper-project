The streets of Valletta were filled with excitement as people celebrated their newfound sovereignty. The Maltese flag flew high and proud, symbolizing the nation's independence and the start of a new era. It was a historic moment that brought a sense of hope and optimism for the future of Malta and its people.U.S.A. Neutrality Acts1939On September 21, 1939, the U.S. Congress passed the Neutrality Acts, a series of laws aimed at keeping the United States out of the growing conflict in Europe that would become World War II. The acts prohibited the sale or shipment of arms to belligerent nations and established a "cash and carry" policy for non-military goods, meaning that warring countries could purchase U.S. goods as long as they paid in cash and transported them using their own ships. The Neutrality Acts reflected the American public's desire to avoid another devastating war but ultimately proved ineffective in preventing the country's entry into World War II.Belize Gained Full Independence1981Belize gained full independence from Great Britain on September 21, 1981. The country had been a British colony since the mid-19th century, and the road to independence was a gradual process that began in the 1950s. Belize's journey to independence was marked by political and social challenges, including territorial disputes with neighbouring countries and tensions between the ruling party and opposition groups. Despite these challenges, Belize achieved independence peacefully and has since established itself as a sovereign nation in Central America.❯ 2024 View all❮Testing ICP Face Recognition DApp: The Final Result Will Surprise YouPublished on September 21, 2024The Noonification: How to Excel in Your Career: 5 Important Skills to Have (9/21/2024)Published on September 21, 2024Async vs Sync Benchmark (.NET): The Difference Between Asynchronous and Synchronous MethodsPublished on September 21, 2024The TechBeat: Data Migration from Dell ECS to MinIO (9/21/2024)Published on September 21, 2024❯ 2023 View all❮The Copyright Act Preempts State Law Causes of Action: Why the OpenAI Lawsuit Should Be DismissedPublished on September 21, 2023OpenAI Claims the Allegations Against Them Fail to Satisfy Requirements - OpenAI Lawsuit DetailsPublished on September 21, 2023Optimizing International Trade: 5 Key Benefits of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)Published on September 21, 2023How AI-Powered Innovations Can Revolutionize School Technology Systems for the Digital AgePublished on September 21, 2023Proxmox vs. VMware: A Quick ComparisonPublished on September 21, 2023Importance of Web3 Marketing and Women in Web3: An Interview With Victoria VaughanPublished on September 21, 2023Sony's Game Changing Leap into Web3: Jumping From PlayStation to BlockchainPublished on September 21, 2023TO THE THIRD EDITION.Published on September 21, 2023How Much Is API Usage Really Worth?Published on September 21, 2023❯ 2022 View all❮Mergers: The Hack Saving Colleges From DestructionPublished on September 21, 2022Node.js Performance Testing Tools For Getting Proven ResultsPublished on September 21, 2022Display a Number's Prime DigitsPublished on September 21, 2022Managing Your Biases to be a Better Human in TechPublished on September 21, 2022Adding a Headless CMS to Astro in 3 StepsPublished on September 21, 2022Top Players in the Hyperconverged Infrastructure Software Market for 2022Published on September 21, 20224 Ways to Upgrade the Privacy of Your Home Wi-Fi NetworkPublished on September 21, 2022Tips to Choose the Best Tech Stack in 2023Published on September 21, 2022Scaling Your Apps Automatically with Zerops – Both Vertically and HorizontallyPublished on September 21, 2022❯ 2021 View all❮Legitify - Europe's first remote online notarization solutionPublished on September 21, 2021Bitcoin: 'Extreme is Normal'Published on September 21, 2021On Developing Career in Tech with Andrey Goncharov, Senior Software Engineer at FacebookPublished on September 21, 2021The Nitty Gritty of Public Keys vs. Private Keys in CryptoPublished on September 21, 2021Drowning in Information, Gasping for KnowledgePublished on September 21, 2021Hacking Hacker Noon: WTH happens when I submit a story to Hacker Noon?Published on September 21, 2021Why a Quant Chooses to Work on Algorithms Instead of Startups Published on September 21, 2021'Taking the Leap of Faith is the Most Difficult Part of Writing'Published on September 21, 20213 Benefits of Using SaaS Vs Traditional Licensed Software Business ModelPublished on September 21, 2021❯ 2020 View all❮Three Main Components of JavaScriptPublished on September 21, 2020"You Have to Have Privacy, But to What Scale and Under Whose Control?" - Adel de MeyerPublished on September 21, 2020Is GraphQL Still a Thing in 2020?Published on September 21, 2020How is a Dev Team Structured?Published on September 21, 2020Why I Will Be Opening an Office in 2021Published on September 21, 2020How The Great Recession Led Me To Innovate NowPublished on September 21, 2020Top 5 Business App Categories during COVID-19Published on September 21, 2020Decentralization Debate Club: Blockchain, Autonomy, and DeFiPublished on September 21, 2020Blockchains Are Being Built Around Decentralized Finance, but Tread CarefullyPublished on September 21, 2020❯ 2019 View all❮My Data!
