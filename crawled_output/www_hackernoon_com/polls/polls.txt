A recent survey found a majority of the public believes AI companies should be held primarily accountable for potential harms, more so than users or the government.Download Poll258 VotersPoll ResultsThe company that developed and sold the AI33%The organization or individual who used the AI21%Accountability is impossible to assign to a single group16%The government for failing to implement proper laws11%The specific engineers who wrote the code10%Other - Comment Below Your Thoughts!9% Are you Team Bluesky or Mississippi Age Assurance Law?Bluesky has blocked access in Mississippi after the state enacted HB1126, the Age Assurance Law, which requires online platforms to verify users’ ages with government IDs or third-party checks. The company argues that such laws undermine privacy, chill free expression, and clash with its decentralized model, where user data isn’t meant to be funneled through centralized ID checks. Lawmakers, however, claim the rules are essential to keep minors safe online.

For better or worse, it's becoming a staple of the modern internet. To help users navigate this shift, platforms have introduced diverse labeling systems.

Startups and open-source labs are struggling to compete, raising concerns about innovation bottlenecks, transparency, and long-term safety. Meanwhile, regulators in the U.S. and EU are beginning to scrutinize how AI models are developed, distributed, and monetized.
