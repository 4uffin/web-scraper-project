Since 1904, some 15 billion visitors have explored the wild wonders of the U.S. parks.Inspired by the National Park Service, photographer Jonathan Irish inspired by the visited every U.S. national park over 52 weeks.“[National parks] are sacred and cherished places—our greatest personal and national treasures,” says Irish. “It’s a gift to spend a year adventuring and capturing incredible images and stories in some of the most beautiful places on Earth.”Since Irish’s journey, the National Parks Service has designated four additional parks: the Gateway Arch in St. Louis; Indiana Dunes on Lake Michigan; White Sands in New Mexico; and New River Gorge in West Virginia. There are now 63 spaces to explore across the country.Celebrate the grandeur of these priceless national treasures in images, from the crystalline waters of Dry Tortugas in Florida to the deep, dark recesses of Kentucky’s Mammoth Cave.1. Zion National Park, UtahWatchman at Zion National ParkPhotograph by Jonathan Irish One of the most photographed views in Zion National Park is of Watchman Mountain from the Canyon Junction Bridge.
