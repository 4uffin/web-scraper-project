Thanks to thriving domestic industries and a 20,000-strong permanent population, Syros never relied on tourism as other Greek islands did, preferring not to call attention to itself. However, as visitors pivot away from crowded hot spots and party islands, looking intead for more authentic cultural experiences in Greece, the secret of Syros’ beauty, architecture, and, of course, cuisine, is finally out.Known as “the queen of the Aegean,” the island is experiencing a surge in visitors alongside a culinary revival. Greek chefs, who have trained in some of Europe’s best restaurants, have merged a strong local tradition of food production with international cooking techniques to create unique flavors and innovative dishes, all without losing that special touch that gives Greek cuisine international recognition.Dining in ErmoupoliRed prawn sausage with fava at Aristide Restaurant in Syros.Photograph by Oana Aristide, Hotel AristideA far cry from the classic white and blue houses of the Aegean, the main town of Ermoupoli instead calls to mind the neoclassical designs and pastels of Italy, perhaps a nod to the historic influence of Venice and Genoa on the island.Enjoy rooftop dining with a view of magnificently lit local churches like St. Nicholas at both Aristide Restaurant in Aristide Hotel, and Elexis at the newly opened Argini Hotel. Both hotels are housed in restored neoclassical mansions and provide such excellent amenities and hospitality that they were included in the 2025 Michelin Guide. Aristide and Elexis focus on a farm-to-table concept, relying on local ingredients while providing dishes with a gourmet twist and excellent local wine pairings.At Aristide, the chef and head bartender have an informal competition to see whose creations are better—the winner is always the customer.Aristide Restaurant is sought-after for its locally sourced ingredients and Aegean Sea views.Photograph by Giorgos Alifragis, Hotel AristideCloser to the center of town lies chef Konstantinos Bourantas’ Avant Garden. After studying at the Swiss Alpine cooking school and working in some of Europe’s best fine dining establishments, Bourantas opened Avant Garden to create Mediterranean-influenced dishes that utilize Cycladic ingredients, like his sought-after risotto.Travelers who want more casual, traditional local cuisine should head to Revans Syros, set up like an authentic kafeneio. Locals gather at kafeneia for hours over coffee, ouzo, and mezedes (small platters). At Revans, new dishes appear on the menu daily, depending on what ingredients are available in the neighboring market stalls. Order them with a side of ouzo or tsipouro, and in true Greek fashion, remember to take your time.Northern wine tastingsUpon seeing the dry, rocky slopes of Syros, the average visitor would never guess that multiple wineries populate the northern section of the island. And yet, locals have cultivated vineyards in this seemingly barren landscape for centuries.Family-run wineries, like Chatzakis and Ousyra, both about five miles (eight kilometers) northwest of Ermoupoli, work with local winemakers and plant their own vines using terrace farming. Visit both wineries for tastings and enjoy local island varieties while surveying the surrounding Aegean islands, easily visible from this high up. Native wines include Serifiotiko, a white wine made from a rare Greek grape, and Fokiano, a red grape variety.(Greece’s most romantic seaside town is the perfect slow-travel destination)Cheeses, desserts, and where to find themTwo of Syros’ best-known products are San Michali cheese and loukoumia, a jelly-type dessert. The locally produced San Michali is PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) certified by the European Union, meaning it must be made exclusively from Syros cows’ milk. Local cheesemakers, like the family-owned Tyrosyra, specialize in making this hard cheese with a rich and slightly nutty and spicy flavor. You will also find it in almost every local restaurant.Loukoumia, also known as Turkish delight, is a local delicacy.Photograph by Piotr Krzeslak, ShutterstockLoukoumia, otherwise known as Turkish delight, are sold and eaten throughout Greece. But Syros is famous for its version of this dessert, due to a long history of refugees from the Ottoman Empire making these sweets after arriving on the island’s shores, and because of the local brackish water, which supposedly enhances the flavor.Locals head to Leivadaras and Korres to buy loukoumia and the other Greek dessert Syros is famous for: halvadopita, or halva pies, consisting of nougat sandwiched between two thin wafers.Seaside tavernasTraveling to a Greek island without a stop at the beach is ill-advised. Thankfully, Syros has some great tavernas on its west-facing beaches that give customers a dazzling sunset view and a feast of freshly caught seafood.Head to Dyo Tzitzikia Sta Armyrikia on Kini Beach to see the Aegean Sea lapping at the sand as you taste classics like octopus, calamari, and Greek salad. Kini is generally known for having the best sunset view in all of Syros.Alternative sunset destinations include Calmo Mare at Foinikas, locally famous for its friendly service and magnificent view, and Meltemi, right near the island’s popular Agathopes Beach, which features gold sand and shallow waters. Meltemi is focused on local sourcing and serves vegetables grown on its own farm.(Olive oil tourism is taking off in Greece. Here’s where to taste it.)Dining in a medieval villageThe oldest existing settlement in Syros is the medieval village of Ano Syros, overlooking Ermoupoli and the sea beyond it. Visitors can take a taxi from the main town or hike up the almost 900 steps to Ano Syros.Paved narrow alley of Ano Syros, a medieval village in Syros.Photograph by Andronosh, Alamy Stock PhotoBuilt in the early 1200s, Ano Syros does not allow cars within its town limits, so you must explore its winding, charming paths on foot. Under hanging bougainvilleas, and among jewelry boutiques, galleries, and shops with handcrafted goods, you will find traditional small plate restaurants like Apanochoritissa, which offers a terrace with a view. The tables that offer panoramas may require a wait.Travelers should also check out Maison de Meze, a culinary workshop that produces and sells many famous local food products. The owners keep the shop’s production at a small scale, always changing the items offered depending on the season, and on the availability and quality of local ingredients. From cheeses to herbs to Greek coffee, you will find bold flavors and health-conscious products, perfect for bringing a taste of Syros home with you.(9 essential dishes to try on your next trip to Greece)Joanna Kalafatis is a travel journalist and actress based between New York City and Athens, Greece.
