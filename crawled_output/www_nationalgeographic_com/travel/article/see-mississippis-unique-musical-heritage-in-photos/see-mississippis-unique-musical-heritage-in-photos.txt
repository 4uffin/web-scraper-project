His grandfather, Ellis Johnson, was also a prominent bluesman in Mississippi and played regularly with Robert Johnson, the man who’s said to have sold his soul to the devil at the junction of highways 49 and 61 in exchange for his otherworldly guitar skills. Super Chikan is based in Clarksdale, one of the US’s leading music destinations, where live music can be heard 365 days of the year. As well as custom-making guitars and diddley bows in his home studio-workshop, 74-year-old Johnson is still performing, and believes the blues is most impactful in the land of its birth.Photograph by Simon UrwinCome listen to the Blues in a Clarksdale juke joint — It’ll punch you in the gut and rip your heart out.James 'Super Chikan' JohnsonThe Delta’s southernmost point is historic Vicksburg, famed for its twin bridges over the Mississippi River.Photograph by Simon UrwinIn 1863, the defeat of the Confederate army here proved pivotal, hastening the end of the Civil War.
