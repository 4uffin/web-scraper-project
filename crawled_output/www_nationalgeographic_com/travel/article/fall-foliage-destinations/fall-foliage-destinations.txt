9 places to see fall foliage in the U.S.—and none are in New England | National Geographic
TRAVEL9 unexpected places to see fall foliage in the U.S.Skip the crowds of New England and experience leaf-peeping season in under-the-radar places like Oregon, Colorado, and even southern regions in California.New England is famous for its leaf peeping, but there are many regions around the nation that show off colorful autumn leaves.Photograph by Evan BatesByEmily HochbergSeptember 23, 2025Autumn in New England is a sight to behold, as the trees transform in color from leafy green to canary yellow, burnt orange, and scarlet red. Millions flock to the country’s six most northern states to see it in an annual pilgrimage known as leaf peeping.But it’s not the only place where this stunning annual spectacle takes place.From the plains of Montana to the mountains of Asheville, and in unexpected locations like Southern California, here are nine places outside of New England where fall foliage builds in a brilliant crescendo of color. Keep in mind that peaks of color can be sudden and inconsistent, usually taking place between late September and November, depending on the elevation and recent weather.Big Bear, California Southern California might not be top of mind for foliage, but the trees of Big Bear offer an unexpected canvas of color. “The color in Big Bear is vibrant,” says Lara Kaylor, editor and publisher of the foliage-tracking website, California Fall Color. “You will see pockets of color set against dramatically beautiful mountains and alpine lakes. It is what makes color spotting in the Golden State unique.”Kaylor notes visitors can expect to see shades of lime, yellow, orange, and pops of red, most often around Big Bear Lake, the Aspen Grove Trail, Green Valley Lake, and while driving the Rim of the World Scenic Byway. “Hiking in any of these areas is highly recommended. It is a great way to see fall colors.” For an on-the-water perspective, board the Big Bear Queen, which operates boat tours with all-encompassing views until November. The front-row perch from the newly restored 1960s Viking lodge-inspired Hotel Marina Riviera is also stunning with its barrel sauna, outdoor fire pits, and restaurant facing the lake’s shores.The OzarksThe Ozarks stretch across Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and a corner of Kansas, but the area where Arkansas and Missouri meet is particularly distinctive for foliage.In Fayetteville, Arkansas, the colors appear with force along the 19-mile Pig Trail Scenic Byway, a windy backroad that weaves through the Ozark National Forest. Hikes within Kessler Mountain are also impressive, with 10 miles of trails.In Ridgedale, Missouri, leaf peepers can check into Big Cedar Lodge, an expansive lakefront wilderness resort with a weekly fall festival and a 62-foot yacht that takes guests on a foliage day cruise around Table Rock Lakes passage. The resort also operates Top of the Rock, a magnificent viewpoint over Table Rock Lake with a self-guided nature trail, a museum, restaurants, and a nightly sunset ceremony.Fall foliage at Boulder Bridge in Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C.Photograph by John Baggaley, Getty ImagesWashington, D.C.The nation’s capital and its monuments and memorials provide an extraordinary backdrop for foliage.Within the city limits, Rock Creek Park has over 32 miles of wooded hiking trails that become encased in color annually; the Valley Trail at Rapids Bridge is one such highlight. “People can enjoy a national park, experience fall foliage, and be in the middle of fascinating mature woodlands and valleys without having to leave the city,” says Ana Chuquin, the park’s botanist.Other key spots include the United States National Arboretum, a 451-acre park that hosts events like evening forest bathing; Great Falls Park, where the Potomac becomes flanked by striking hues; and Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, where the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers meet amid foliage-filled scenery.Asheville, North Carolina“The Southern Appalachians contain the most diverse forests in the country, providing a wide array of colors that change slowly over the course of a season,” says Evan Fisher, an Asheville-based meteorologist and founder of ExploreFall, which provides nationwide foliage forecasts. (Asheville is open for fall foliage season. Here’s what to see and do.)“The dramatic elevation changes in the region ensure there is always peak fall color ongoing from early October to early November,” Fisher says. Roadside stop along the Blue Ridge Parkway.Photograph by Daniel GajdaTake it in from the Blue Ridge Parkway, which runs from the Great Smoky Mountains through several of North Carolina's prominent mountain ranges. While some sections remain closed following Hurricane Helene, hiking in Graveyard Fields and Grandfather Mountain is open. When considering where to stay, look locally. “The Asheville area is full of Airbnbs and small inns that are still struggling with low occupancy post-Helene,” says Fisher. “Staying at one of those locations gives visitors a local advantage since their owners often share resources as well as tips and tricks for enjoying fall's splendor.”Vail, ColoradoNestled in western Colorado, the village of Vail feels plucked from a fairy tale with atmospheric Bavarian-inspired architecture. And in fall, thick groves of aspen trees change from green to gold.“Everything turns yellow, including on the ground,” says Chelsea Brisson, who leads local hiking tours with Paragon Guides. “It’s monotone but the sun is so bright that it reflects and becomes a tunnel of yellow.”Brisson tailors hikes to pinpoint up-to-the-minute foliage, or visitors can hop into a jeep with Vail 4x4 Tours to reach places like Piney River Ranch. The remote 40-acre mountain retreat within the White River National Forest is only open until the end of September, but has jaw-dropping views.In the fall, the Catskill Mountains are a kaleidoscope of red, orange, and yellow leaves.Photograph by Nick Pedersen, Getty ImagesUpstate New YorkYou don’t have to shun the Northeast to experience fall color. Upstate New York is not part of New England and has foliage in abundance, often with fewer crowds.The rich colors from maple, birch, poplar, and oak trees “create a tapestry of color that changes with elevation, location, and weather, so no two seasons are exactly alike," says Jeff Senterman, the executive director of the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development and co-owner of Hike on Guides.Within the Catskills, visit the 26-mile Catskill Scenic Trail or Bramley Mountain and its fire tower, where “colors spread out across fields and mountains for miles,” says Ann Roberti, president of Friends of Bramley Mountain Fire Tower.The Adirondacks, meanwhile, is a six-million-acre wilderness park with one of the longest foliage seasons in the country. “You can hike, canoe, kayak, or just simply enjoy the fall foliage around Mirror Lake while dining at one of the restaurants or shopping on Main Street,” says Mary Catherine Spinelli, director of sales for Whiteface Lodge. “A few excellent hikes for fall are High Falls Gorge, Cobble Lookout, and Hurricane Mountain.”Westchester County is also an “under-appreciated gem,” says Max Apton, a horticulturist, landscape designer, and farm owner. “It has dramatic river views, sweeping vistas of rolling hills and dirt roads that wind their way under dense canopies of trees.”Harbor Springs is home to the colorful "tunnel of trees."Photograph by Jouko van der Kruijssen, Getty ImagesMichiganMichigan has over 19 million acres of forests, creating the optimal backdrop for a wave of color, most notably in the state’s Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula. “Michigan is home to a number of tree species that are famous for their fiery reds and oranges, shimmering golds and yellows and rust-colored browns,” says Kelly Wolgamott, vice president of Pure Michigan.In Michigan's Lower Peninsula, Wolgamott recommends Harbor Springs in mid-October, which is home to the foliage-filled M-119 route, affectionately dubbed the "tunnel of trees." It’s also where you can take in panoramic vistas from SkyBridge Michigan and ride a chairlift over the trees at Boyne Mountain Resort.In Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Keweenaw Peninsula’s location and microclimate creates "an out-of-this-world color viewing experience," says Wolgamott. Brockway Mountain Drive near Copper Harbor leads to panoramic views of the peninsula and Lake Superior.(8 of the best small towns for fall foliage in New England and beyond)MontanaEach fall, Montana’s rugged, vast landscapes reveal large swaths of color within the Rocky Mountains, the Great Plains, and Yellowstone National Park.“Our fall foliage isn’t a blanket, it’s a mosaic,” says Ash Tallmadge, general manager of a Yellowstone Safari Company. “Golden cottonwoods trace the rivers, aspens flash bright on the hillsides, and evergreens frame everything in deep green. Add in snow and roaming bison or bugling elk, and you get an especially unique experience.”Tallmadge calls Yellowstone's Lamar Valley "one the most magical valleys in the Northern Rockies," with fields of grass that turn radiant shades of gold, auburn, tangerine, and crimson. In Bozeman, visitors can find similar shades in Missouri Headwaters State Park, within Hyalite Canyon Recreation Area, and along the Gallatin River corridor that bends through tall cliffs and forests.Southern Oregon Oregon's foliage differs significantly from the rest of the country. “Southern Oregon offers a mix you won’t find back east; fall colors set against dramatic mountain landscapes, a wild and scenic river and even a volcanic national park,” says Jim Remley, owner of the Medford/Gold Hill KOA Journey, an RV park and campground that’s peppered with trees near the foliage-lined Rogue River.Remley recommends Crater Lake National Park to juxtapose the fiery gold, red, and orange leaves against the vivid blue tones of the lake, or a drive along the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway, which heads through canyons and valleys punctuated by bursts of color that are reflected in the water.There’s also historical Jacksonville, a former gold rush town with tree-lined streets that turn yellow and red in fall, and Ashland, with abundant maples, oaks and sycamores.(How climate change disrupts fall foliage)Emily Hochberg is a Southern California-based freelance travel writer and editor with over 15 years of experience covering destinations, hotels, luxury, family travel, transportation and lifestyle.
