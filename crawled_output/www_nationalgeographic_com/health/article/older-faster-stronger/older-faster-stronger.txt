Since 1900, we’ve managed to increase our life expectancy, from 47 to 78, even though we’re only just now beginning to understand the science of longevity—and what exactly human beings are capable of as we live deeper, and healthier, into our 70s, 80s, 90s, even 100s.To help you harness all that we’re learning about how to age athletically, National Geographic found a handful of people hitting their stride in the last leg of their lives. We also share some pointers about how to start extending your health span right now, no matter how old you are, and some wisdom—pep talks, really—from four of the greatest athletic specimens of the 20th century.'I want to live to be 100.'
