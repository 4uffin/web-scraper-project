Join the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge: $3,000 in Prizes!

We're excited to announce our first challenge with Google AI!
Running through September 14, the Google AI Studio Multimodal Challenge invites you to build and deploy innovative applets that showcase the incredible power of Gemini's multimodal capabilities.
There's one prompt for this challenge but three chances to win! We hope you give it a try.
Our Prompt
Your mission is to build and deploy an applet on Google AI Studio that shows off the power of Gemini in multimodal content understanding and/or generation.
Your applet must meet these requirements:
Built on Google AI Studio
Deployed using Cloud Run
Utilize at least one of the below multimodal functionality:
Gemini 2.5 Pro / Flash-supported image, video, or audio understanding
Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (free tier available for Sept 6-7)
Live API (free tier supports 3 concurrent sessions)
Imagen (requires paid tier)
Veo (requires paid tier)
Think interactive storytelling experiences, tools that process audio and visual content, platforms that understand and generate content across multiple media types. If you can think it, you can build it!
Important Notes:
Use of paid APIs are purely optional and won't enhance your chance of winning.
If you used Gemini 2.5 Flash Image during the free trial period and it is no longer available for your app during the judging period, be sure to include a video so we can see your project in action.
"Build Apps with Google AI Studio" DEV Education Track submissions do not count towards this challenge, you must build and deploy a new, original applet.
How To Participate
To participate, create your Google AI Studio account and publish a post using the submission template below.
Your applet should demonstrate creative and practical applications of Gemini's multimodal capabilities. Think beyond basic demos - how can multimodal AI solve real problems or create delightful experiences?
Google AI Studio Challenge Submission Template
Be sure to review our judging criteria, rules, guidelines, and FAQ page before submitting so you understand our participation guidelines and official contest rules.
Please note: additional eligibility requirements are listed below.
Prizes
We'll select three winners for this challenge. Each winner will receive:
$1,000 USD
DEV++ Membership
Exclusive DEV Badge
All Participants with a valid submission will receive a completion badge on their DEV profile.

Interesting challenge, but I have a question: If I recall correctly, doesn't deploying an applet to Cloud Run require a billing account, which in turn incurs billing for the participant per run? Is the deployment part mandatory?

Hey @delaaja, great call out. Deployment is required, and Cloud Run actually has a substantial free tier, which should cover anything incurred from our judging usage. Please see this page here to see what's covered, so you can be aware while testing (pre-submission): https://cloud.google.com/run?e=48754805&hl=en#pricing

Hello mam @jess
Can I create the app in Gemini itself, then zip the code, and work on it locally using Gemini CLI? I'll be deploying the app, but not using Cloud Run, but probably Netlify/Vercel.
Would it be eligible, or will it make it ineligible for the challenge?

Question about contest rules:
Hi! I have a question about the development workflow for this challenge.
My situation:
I created a new, original applet in Google AI Studio specifically for this contest
Downloaded the generated code to continue development locally
Now I'm enhancing it further using Gemini CLI for additional features and improvements
Is this approach compliant with the contest rules? The applet was created from scratch for the challenge, but I'm now developing it further outside of the AI Studio interface using Google's own development tools.
Thanks for clarification!

To be honest, I don't really understand the point of the challenge. The models that can actually generate something useful are all paid. Fine, I added billing. Now I’ve built a game, and it generates images during gameplay. The limit for the first tier is 70 requests per day. I have 4 images per run, so basically I used up all my requests just this morning and now I can’t even record a video of the game. I’ll have to wait until tomorrow.
The third model, imagen-3.0-generate-001, isn’t even available via API, it says it’s not supported. And to move to Tier 2, I apparently need to spend $300 somehow.
So overall, it’s not really clear what the organizers were expecting. I'll wait for tomorrow to record my demo videos but overall so far experience is not what I expected for the goal "Think interactive storytelling experiences, tools that process audio and visual content, platforms that understand and generate content across multiple media types."

ok, I found that gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview also can generate images - but Google AI Studio doesn't know how to use this model so in the end I fixed the code by myself.
