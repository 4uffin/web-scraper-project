Imagine paying thousands for a smart fridge only to see it turn into a billboard in your kitchen. That is the reality with Samsung smart fridge ads, now rolling out in the US. And no, you cannot really turn them off.

What Samsung is Doing
Samsung is running a pilot program in the US that brings ads to its high-end Family Hub refrigerators. Owners are discovering promotions on the cover screen when the appliance is idle, particularly in themes such as Weather, Color, and Daily Board.
While you can dismiss the ads once per campaign, they loop back since there’s no universal opt-out. So, you cannot block them entirely.

The company frames it as curated promotions to enhance value, pulling in personalized suggestions based on your habits. However, based on our experience following their gear, such as the Bespoke fridges that order groceries for you, this seems like a sales ploy to boost the slumping appliance numbers.
Why Forced Ads in Your Kitchen Cross the Line
Ads are expected on free apps or budget services, not on a $3,000 refrigerator. Samsung’s move feels like a breach of trust, especially with no way to disable them fully.
Privacy? That’s even worse. Samsung has not explained whether the ads will be targeted or if user data will be used. To me, it feels invasive. The kitchen is personal, and now that space is treated as an advertising surface.
Worse, it signals a loss of control in a breach-happy world. If you cannot decide what shows on your own appliance, do you truly own it? It undermines the smart home promise we all chase: convenience at the cost of autonomy.
If Samsung Can Do This to Fridges, What’s Next?
Samsung already monetizes its smart TVs with ads. Now refrigerators are in play. Let Samsung smart fridge ads slide, and soon your washer might pitch detergent mid-spin. Then, they creep into ovens or even thermostats.
This is the new business model: shifting from one-time appliance sales to ongoing ad revenue. It sounds absurd today, but so did fridge ads not long ago.
If you accept it from Samsung, the rest of the industry may follow suit. Hence, this is a wake-up that tech ownership may end up turning into endless upsells.
Fight Back Against Samsung’s Fridge Ads
Pushing back on Samsung smart fridge ads isn’t easy, but you can try the following tips to reduce the annoyance.
Switch to Art mode or photo loops to keep ads off your cover screen, since it only pops up when the screen is idle. Just like customizing a Samsung phone’s home screen, this tweak gives you back some control.
Also, you can delay updates if possible. And for a total block, simply cut off Wi-Fi totally if you can live without online tools, though it nixes the camera. I know it defeats the whole purpose of a smart home, but it’s a necessary evil at this point.
Resets risk warranty hits, so avoid that. Better yet, consider alternatives like LG or GE for ad-free smarts. Also, spam Samsung support and forums; your collective voice matters. And remember, your wallet is your loudest protest. Brands will notice if people avoid smart fridges that double as billboards.
Samsung smart fridge ads may start small, but they set a troubling precedent. Once a company learns it can turn expensive appliances into ad platforms, others may do the same. It’s time to demand better, and let them know this is a line where smart convenience simply goes too far.
