High Quality and Durable Design
Forget a bulky PC taking up half your desktop. The GEEKOM A6 Mini PC is a stylish, 4.4 x 4.4 x 1.4 inch box that fits perfectly in the home or office. A high-quality aluminum alloy case keeps the box both lightweight and durable.
As with most mini PCs, it’s easy to place the device wherever you want. Display it near your monitor on the desk or mount it on the wall or even behind your monitor with the included VESA mount.
Ample Ports for Most Users
The highly versatile GEEKOM A6 lends itself to a wide variety of setups, thanks to the ample ports. Whether you’re using it mainly for entertainment or office productivity, you’ll love having the following:
3 x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2
1 x USB-A 2.0
1 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2
1 x USB-C 4 Gen 3
3.5 mm audio jack
Ethernet port
2 x HDMI 2.0
SD card reader
For a compact form factor, that’s an impressive amount of ports. Many desktops don’t even offer this many options.
Perfect Specs for Home and Office
What really makes this such a versatile PC, though, is the specs. It’s designed to easily jump between basic productivity apps, light to medium gaming, video editing, 3D modeling, and much more. Consider it a multitasker’s paradise.
All of this is possible thanks to the AMD Ryzen 7 6800H CPU (4.7GHz, 8 cores, 16 threads, and 16MB cache). Add in the AMD Radeon 680M iGPU, and it’s ideal for many fan favorite games like Fortnite and Apex Legends, along with handling your favorite 4K movies and shows.
Multitasking and gaming are even better with 32GB of dual channel DDR5-4800 RAM. This means faster loading and less annoying lag time. Need more memory? Expand the GEEKOM A6 Mini PC to 64GB of RAM at any time.
Storage space is a precious commodity, especially with so many desktop PCs having only 256 GB. The A6 Mini PC offers up a spacious 1TB SSD. That’s around 200,000 photos or 200 hours of 1080p video. Once again, if you need more, this PC is expandable to up to 2TB.
It’s capable of a wide variety of uses, such as:
Diving into your favorite virtual worlds. While it’s not for high-end gaming, it’s more than powerful enough to handle light gaming with no issues.
Pursuing creative hobbies and professions. Edit video in Adobe Premiere Pro, design breathtaking graphics in Adobe Photoshop, and even craft your own music in Ableton Live.
Managing coding, data processing, and numerous IT tasks. Easily run your favorite development platforms like Fiddler, Visual Studio, and Docker. Plus, connect multiple monitors to keep track of projects without constantly switching tabs.
Managing data, writing, and collaborating. All your favorite productivity apps come together, such as Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Adobe Acrobat, Slack, and Zoom.
Stays Cool Under Pressure
With such a small form factor, you may be worried about heat, especially when multitasking or performing resource intensive tasks like video editing and gaming. GEEKOM utilizes a layered cooling system that directs heat through each layer until it exits out the rear of the chassis.
This pairs with GEEKOM’s IceBlast cooling technology. The result is a cool PC, even when you push it to the limit. And it’s so efficient that you barely hear the fan at all.
Fast, Reliable Wireless Connectivity
Enjoy three different ways to stay connected with the GEEKOM A6 Mini PC. Use the 2.5Gbps Ethernet port for a fast, reliable wired Internet connection. Or, take advantage of the built-in Wi-Fi 6E for speedy wireless connections.
When it comes to your Bluetooth peripherals, don’t worry. Bluetooth 5.4 ensures you’ll have no issues connecting all your devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, and headphones.
Support for 4K and 8K Video
Whether it’s for gaming, work, or just watching movies and shows, the A6 Mini PC
has you covered. Connect up to four 4K displays. This lets you truly customize your setup for your needs.
Even better, it’s also capable of handling 8K video. Stream your favorite movies in stunning 8K, as long as your monitor supports it, of course.
Comes With Windows 11 Pro
While many desktops come with Windows 11 Home, the GEEKOM A6 Mini PC is preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro. This gives you even more advanced features, such as Hyper-V for virtualization, Windows Information Protection (a data loss tool), and BitLocker drive encryption. You also get far more admin tools built in.
But you’re not limited to Windows. Prefer Linux or want a dual- or multi-boot environment? The A6 makes it simple to add more operating systems to best meet your needs.
Thoroughly Tested for Durability
GEEKOM rigorously tests their mini PCs, including the A6, to ensure it’s ready for an exciting, active life on your desktop. Just a few of the most notable tests include:
15,000 cycles of plug and unplug testing for USB interfaces – don’t be afraid to use your favorite USB devices regularly. This mini PC can handle it.
120 hours of high/low temperature tests
90 minutes of vibration testing
EMI radiation tests from 30 MHz to 1 GHz to ensure electromagnetic compatibility
330 hours of system stability testing
Some of these tests may sound extreme, but that’s the point. You want a PC that lasts for years, and GEEKOM designs their mini PCs to deliver just that.
Affordable and Available in Multiple Varieties
The GEEKOM A6 Mini PC has three models. The main one features all the specs above, including 32 GB of RAM and a 1 TB SSD. As with most mini PCs, it features a black and silver design. Even better, you can buy this model for just $479.
Or, maybe you want to spice things up? Opt for the pink edition of the GEEKOM A6 to add a subtle pop of color to your home desktop or office.
But if you don’t need a mini PC that’s quite as powerful, try the GEEKOM A6 Mini PC with 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD. It’s still perfect for the home and office but only costs $348.
No matter which model you choose at Best Buy, you’ll have a reliable, durable, and powerful multitasking machine to handle most any task you need.
