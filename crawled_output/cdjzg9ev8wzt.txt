For Van de Ven's strike, West Ham had eight players in their box to Spurs' three, yet were still beaten to the loose ball. Tottenham analysis: Post-Levy era starts in perfect fashionTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, Spurs 'serious' top four contenders - Ashley WilliamsThe first game of the post-Daniel Levy era could hardly have gone much better for Tottenham.While the sudden departure of the Premier League's longest-serving chairman had placed scrutiny on the club's ownership and operations off the pitch at boardroom level, back on the pitch, Spurs responded with a professional display.With the Lewis family represented in the stands by Vivienne Lewis and her son-in-law Nick Beucher and chief executive Vinai Venkatesham also present, there was a chance for influential figures to enjoy watching Frank's side control proceedings for long periods.Had Van de Ven not hauled home defender Kyle Walker-Peters to the floor, they would have gone ahead from Cristian Romero's first-half header, which was ruled out for the infringement.Mohammed Kudus, who was roundly booed each time he touched the ball on his return to the club he left in the summer provided a useful outlet down the Tottenham right.However, Sweden midfielder Bergvall stole the show having been reintroduced to the side, playing several lovely passes and taking the responsibility of initiating numerous attacks.The 19-year-old completed 89% of his passes and capped an excellent display with both a goal and an assist for Van de Ven.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption, 'More to come' from new signing Simons - FrankWhat's next for these sides?West Ham host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday, 20 September, at 15:00 BST.Tottenham face Villarreal at home in the Champions League on Tuesday, 16 September and then travel to play Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday, 20 September, at 15:00 BST.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.

farMatch FactsScroll LeftScroll RightWest Ham have won just one of their last seven Premier League matches against Tottenham Hotspur (D3 L3), a 2-1 away win in December 2023.Each of the last three Premier League meetings between West Ham and Spurs at the London Stadium have ended as 1-1 draws â Spurs are winless in five league visits (D3 L2) since a 3-2 win in November 2019.West Ham lost their first two Premier League games of 2025-26 but beat Nottingham Forest 3-0 on MD3 â theyâve only won consecutive matches once since David Moyes departed the club, doing so in February 2025.Spurs have lost 10 of their last 16 London derbies in the Premier League (W3 D3), keeping just one clean sheet in their last 21 derby matches in the league, a 2-0 away win at Thomas Frankâs Brentford in February 2025.Having averaged 3.4 shots on target per game across their first 20 Premier League matches under Graham Potter, West Ham had eight in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest, their most in a league game under him.Tottenham Hotspur have lost 17 of their last 23 Premier League matches that havenât been against newly promoted sides (W3 D3), with two of their last four league wins against non-promoted sides coming away at the Etihad against Manchester City in November 2024 and August 2025.In his first Premier League appearance since January, Crysencio Summerville came on as an 82nd minute substitute and assisted a goal and won a penalty for West Ham in their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest â he was the first player in Premier League history to be subbed on that late in a game and achieve that.Following a 2-0 win away at Man City, Thomas Frank is looking to become just the third Spurs manager to win his first two away top-flight matches in charge of the club, along with Ossie Ardiles in 1993-94 and Tim Sherwood in 2013-14.Jarrod Bowen has had a hand in nine Premier League goals in his last nine appearances (6 goals, 3 assists). Since his first appearance under Graham Potter in early February, only Mohamed Salah (15) has scored and assisted more goals than Bowen (9 goals, 4 assists) in the Premier League.Tottenham Hotspur defender Pedro Porro has played 86 Premier League games but never been involved in a 0-0 draw, an all-time record without featuring in one. Itâs the second-longest start to a Premier League career without a 0-0, with only MikaÃ«l Silvestre going more games from his debut without a goalless one (134 matches before featuring in Man Utd 0-0 Arsenal in September 2003).Live TextPostat 90 minutes plus 690'+6Match ends, West Ham United 0, Tottenham Hotspur 3.Full Timeat 90 minutes plus 690'+6Second Half ends, West Ham United 0, Tottenham Hotspur 3.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Brennan Johnson (Tottenham Hotspur) wins a free kick in the defensive half.Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Foul by El Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham United).Postat 90 minutes plus 590'+5Attempt missed.
