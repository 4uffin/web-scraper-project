Innovating with machine learning on AWS
On AWS, you can access performant infrastructure, deployment resources, data governance solutions, and AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) with optimized open source frameworks, so that you can focus on your machine learning tasks.
Build and Scale AI/ML on AWS
AWS offers a comprehensive suite of AI/ML tools and services that support every stage of the machine learning lifecycle. From model development and training to deployment and inference, AWS provides cutting-edge solutions such as Amazon SageMaker AI, a fully-managed service for end-to-end development and deployment of models, Amazon Bedrock for building and scaling generative AI applications with foundation models ‚Äî including AgentCore for deploying AI agents securely at scale with purpose-built infrastructure and multi-framework support, custom AI accelerator chips such as AWS Trainium for training and AWS Inferentia for inference, and pre-configured environments to streamline your ML workflows. Additionally, you can explore the Registry of Open Data to explore and access datasets for your AI/ML projects. Whether you're working on large language models, generative AI, computer vision, time-series forecasting, or natural language processing ‚Äî scaling your projects on AWS is easy.
