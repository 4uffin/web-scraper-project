Introduction
This September, we are pleased to introduce Qwen-Image-Edit-2509, the monthly iteration of Qwen-Image-Edit. To experience the latest model, please visit Qwen Chat
and select the "Image Editing" feature.
Compared with Qwen-Image-Edit released in August, the main improvements of Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 include:
Multi-image Editing Support: For multi-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 builds upon the Qwen-Image-Edit architecture and is further trained via image concatenation to enable multi-image editing. It supports various combinations such as "person + person," "person + product," and "person + scene." Optimal performance is currently achieved with 1 to 3 input images.
Enhanced Single-image Consistency: For single-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 significantly improves editing consistency, specifically in the following areas:
Improved Person Editing Consistency: Better preservation of facial identity, supporting various portrait styles and pose transformations;
Improved Product Editing Consistency: Better preservation of product identity, supporting product poster editing；
Improved Text Editing Consistency: In addition to modifying text content, it also supports editing text fonts, colors, and materials；
Native Support for ControlNet: Including depth maps, edge maps, keypoint maps, and more.
Quick Start
Install the latest version of diffusers
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use Qwen-Image-Edit-2509:
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline
pipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to('cuda')
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open("input1.png")
image2 = Image.open("input2.png")
prompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."
inputs = {
"image": [image1, image2],
"prompt": prompt,
"generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
"true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
"negative_prompt": " ",
"num_inference_steps": 40,
"guidance_scale": 1.0,
"num_images_per_prompt": 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
output = pipeline(**inputs)
output_image = output.images[0]
output_image.save("output_image_edit_plus.png")
print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_plus.png"))
Showcase
The primary update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is support for multi-image inputs.
Let’s first look at a "person + person" example:
Here is a "person + scene" example:
Below is a "person + object" example:
In fact, multi-image input also supports commonly used ControlNet keypoint maps—for example, changing a person’s pose:
Similarly, the following examples demonstrate results using three input images:
Another major update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is enhanced consistency.
First, regarding person consistency, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 shows significant improvement over Qwen-Image-Edit. Below are examples generating various portrait styles:
For instance, changing a person’s pose while maintaining excellent identity consistency:
Leveraging this improvement along with Qwen-Image’s unique text rendering capability, we find that Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 excels at creating meme images:
Of course, even with longer text, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 can still render it while preserving the person’s identity:
Person consistency is also evident in old photo restoration. Below are two examples:
Naturally, besides real people, generating cartoon characters and cultural creations is also possible:
Second, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances product consistency. We find that the model can naturally generate product posters from plain-background product images:
Or even simple logos:
Third, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances text consistency and supports editing font type, font color, and font material:
Moreover, the ability for precise text editing has been significantly enhanced:
It is worth noting that text editing can often be seamlessly integrated with image editing—for example, in this poster editing case:
The final update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is native support for commonly used ControlNet image conditions, such as keypoint control and sketches:
