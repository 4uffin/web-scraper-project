PyTorch Ambassadors
The PyTorch Ambassador Program highlights and supports passionate community leaders who educate, advocate for, and build with PyTorch in meaningful ways.
Ambassadors help grow PyTorch usage around the world by organizing events, creating educational content, mentoring new users, and contributing to the open-source ecosystem.
