Our lives are dominated by long cables and fat adapters, invading our spaces creating unwanted clutter. Just about everything has a battery in it these days and requires daily charging. Your phone? Gotta plug it in. Your headphones? They used to just work, but now they‚Äôre Bluetooth so plug it in. Your watch? My old watch that just told time didn‚Äôt need it‚Äôs battery replaced for years. Now my Apple Watch needs to sit back in it‚Äôs wireless charger before I go to bed every night. Too many things need charging which means our desktops and nightstands are a tangled nightmare. Thankfully, that clutter can be reduced with a solid charging station. Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charger that right now is marked down 40%. Normally priced at $50, that $20 savings means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.
This power strip combines 10 different ports all together, meaning you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You get a mix of six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one USB-A port. With a wide range of compatibility, you won‚Äôt have to use different charging blocks all assembled together. Just plug your devices cables directly to whichever port works. In case you do still need to use one on account of having to charge several USB devices, the power station itself is designed to allow for easy access to the AC outlets. With each facing a different direction, you won‚Äôt end up dealing with losing more than one outlet due to an extra chunky adapter.

Baseus‚Äô power station is designed for a a cleaner workspace. It actually comes with an adhesive strip intended for the underside of the unit. You can keep the power station firmly in place on your desk or nightstand.
Fast Charging
Your devices be it a phone, earbuds, or a MacBook can restore their charge super quickly as the Baseus 10-in-1 power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. To put that in perspective, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones these days is only 20W.
With all these devices charging simultaneously, you may be worried about risk of overheating. Well, the Baseus power stirp utilizes GaN6 technology for safer, cooler charging. It‚Äôs been engineered for efficient heat dissipation soi you stuff can charge fast without getting hot.
Right now, Amazon has the Baseus 10-in-1 charging station for a reduced price of just $30. That‚Äôs a 40% discount down from it‚Äôs base price of $50. You‚Äôll save a whole $20 for a limited time.
