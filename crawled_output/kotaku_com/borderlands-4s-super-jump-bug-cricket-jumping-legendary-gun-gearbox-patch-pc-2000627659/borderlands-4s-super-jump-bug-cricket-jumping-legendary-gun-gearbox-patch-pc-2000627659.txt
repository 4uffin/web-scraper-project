A newly discovered bug in open-world looter shooter Borderlands 4 is letting players use a specific legendary gun to fling themselves across large sections of the game’s map. It looks wild and could be useful for speedrunners. But Gearbox is watching the glitch and might, if needed, fix it to avoid technical problems. On September 19, Twitch streamer and content creator Bahroo shared a video of himself playing Borderlands 4 while pulling off a technique known online as “Cricket Jumping.” The bug relies on a legendary handgun known as the “Noisy Cricket” and its powerful kick, which sends players flying backward. The gun itself is a reference to the tiny gun with the same name seen in the ’90s sci-fi comedy film Men In Black. Normally, this isn’t the most useful trait. But if you tab out or pause the game at the right time while charging up a shot with the Noisy Cricket, you can send yourself flying for miles. It’s wild to watch in action.
Cricket Jumping has been a known bug since at least September 16, as demonstrated in this short video uploaded by YouTube user Platinum. But it wasn’t until Bahroo and other bigger streamers and creators began sharing videos of the technique that it caught on more and became more publicly known. And that attention eventually got Cricket Jumping spotted by Borderlands 4′s creative director Graeme Timmins. While you might assume someone from Gearbox would not be happy about this bug, Timmins seemed open to not patching it out, provided it doesn’t break the game.
“Iâve got my eye on this,” replied Timmins to a video of the bug on Twitter. “My only worry is streaming issues or if this introduces instability. Not out to ruin peopleâs fun, but canât have it cause tech issues. For now, tho, not going to do anything until proven issues arise.” So for now, it seems like Gearbox is going to let people Cricket Jump all around Kairos, assuming it doesn’t ruin the game for other players or introduce some nasty, less cool bug. Besides, I imagine Gearbox has a lot more to fix in Borderlands 4 right now, like horrible console performance problems, and isn’t too concerned about a silly super jump bug.
