Microsoft is perhaps best known for its Surface Pro tablets which compete directly with the iPad Pro but its Surface laptop line has been the best way to experience Windows at its finest. If what you need is a thin, light notebook with full Windows 11, current AI-capable Copilot capabilities and good performance, this is an extremely tempting option. The most affordable model with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Plus processor and 256GB storage has now hit an all-time low cost on Amazon: It costs $859, a discount from its initial price of $999, which is fantastic considering it was launched less than a year ago.

A Laptop for the AI Era
The Surface laptop was designed by Microsoft as part of their new Copilot+ PC series infused with AI functionality that brings real-world benefits to routine computing. This model currently on sale at Amazon comes with the Snapdragon X Plus 10-core processor at its core, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This provides it with a speed where productivity applications and creative burdens are easy, and yet still hold up in terms of power efficiency.
One of the real benefits here is in how the Copilot feature affects everyday life: Recall lets you simply locate documents, e-mails or web pages by backtracking through an activity timeline. With video calls or meetings, Windows Studio Effects powered by Copilot help you declutter your room through noise suppression, better lighting, and a blurred background, which is a lifesaver if meetings extend throughout the day. You can even read real-time subtitles in 44 languages while streaming or on a call which makes international communication a seamless process.
Battery life is also a department where this Microsoft laptop takes the lead: With a 20-hour charge time, it’s designed to last you all day and more without needing to be plugged in. That’s convenient enough to take with you to work or even on a trip without constantly needing to find plugs to recharge. The paper-thin measurements and 13.8-inch touchscreen screen cap it off, giving you a slim and modern design that still gives you plenty of screen space to do your multitasking. Bright HDR technology ensures clarity whether youâre watching shows.
What also makes this deal noteworthy is how early it comes: The Snapdragon X Plus-based Surface Laptop only entered the market in late 2024, yet weâre already seeing its price dip far below the $1,000 mark.
