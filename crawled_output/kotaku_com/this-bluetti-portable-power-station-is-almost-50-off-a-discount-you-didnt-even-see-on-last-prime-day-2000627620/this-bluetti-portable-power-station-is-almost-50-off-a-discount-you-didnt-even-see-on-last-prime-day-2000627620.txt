The summer may have officially ended, but your adventures are only just beginning. Now that Fall is here, leaves will be changing, the air is nice and crispy, and there’s never been a better time to hang outside. Whether you’re looking to tailgate before a football game in the parking lot or take to the wilderness for an extended camping trip, you can set yourself up with all the power you need with a portable power station. BLUETTI’s AC70 portable power station is currently 45% off. It’s usually listed at $599, but you’ll save $270 as the price comes down to just $329 for a limited time.

Power 7 Devices at Once
This power station has a total capacity of 668Wh to keep all your appliances running and your phones charged while in the great outdoors. Power up to seven different devices at once. The power station is equipped with two AC outlets, two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and one car port. You can use this to keep your phone’s charged, run a griddle, or power an electric pump so you can inflate your paddleboard.
When set to powerlifting mode, the BLUETTI is capable of up to 2,000W. It’s usual power level is 1,000W, but when set to give it this added boost of purely resistive load, you can power energy-demanding devices such a hairdryer or kettle. The BLUETTI power station is designed to last for over 3,000 power cycles.
Using the smartphone app, you can monitor the status of your BLUETTI power station remotely. Set the charge or discharge mode and view the current battery level from a distance.
Recharging the power station itself is pretty quick. It’ll boost up from zero to 80% capacity in just 45 minutes. Getting it all the way to 100% only takes an hour and a half.
That’s all when plugged into the wall. Optionally, you can choose to add on a solar panel so you can keep powering your devices over long camping trips. You can get the BLUETTI AC70 power station alongside your choice of either a 100W solar panel or 200W solar panel. The bundle with the 100W panel is going right now for $499 while the bundle with the 200W panel is now set at $649.
If being able to recharge with solar energy isn’t that enticing to you, you can still grab the BLUETTI AC70 power station alone for just $329. That’s a 45% discount, allowing you to save $270 from its usual list price of $599.
