How often do you find your devices fighting each other for the one available charging port? Seriously, it seems now-a-days, just about everything we carry on us has a battery in that requires daily charging. Our phones have been the big one for awhile, but since earbuds have all gone wireless and watches have become smart, we’ve begun needing to charge more and more of our stuff at the end of the day. It’s only a matter of time before we need to start charging our wallets. In the meantime, how are you ensuring everything gets charged? You might want to get yourself a multi-port charging adapter. This brick from Baseus is right now on sale for 40% off. It’s normally priced at $50, but that discount takes off a solid $20. That means it’s yours for just $30 for a limited time.

This Baseus charger features three separate charging ports. It’s equipped with two USB-C ports and one USB-A. Each USB-C port can individually support charging speeds of up to 100W. when split across both with a device plugged into each, the top one will supply 70W while the lower one supplies 30W. The USB-A port can provide up to 22.5W, but when all three are being used, you’ll get 65W and 20W on each of the USB-C ports and 15W on the USB-A. You can optimally choose what’s going in each port when charging multiple devices, such as reserving the fastest port for your laptop, secondary USB-C for your phone, and then the USB-A for your watch or earbuds.
When using single-port charging, that 100W is capable of bringing a MacBook Pro 16-inch âone of the new M4 chipset ones â back up from nothing to a full 100% in under two hours.
Charging multiple devices on one charging brick may sound like it could be at risk of causing devices to overheat. However, Baseus employs a polymer silicon-based heat dissipation to effectively keep temperatures low.
Travel-Friendly
Designed for portability, the Baseus charger has foldable pin design which prevent it from getting hooked or any of your belongings or scratching your bag from the inside.
The size of the charging brick itself is remarkably small. A hug pet peeve of mine is when power supplies end with a chunky brick that is so big, it takes up more than one spot on the power strip. Heck, sometimes some are so poorly designed, they take up three. Not an issue with this Baseus charger, though. It is conveniently compact as to take up only it’s one allotted spot.
