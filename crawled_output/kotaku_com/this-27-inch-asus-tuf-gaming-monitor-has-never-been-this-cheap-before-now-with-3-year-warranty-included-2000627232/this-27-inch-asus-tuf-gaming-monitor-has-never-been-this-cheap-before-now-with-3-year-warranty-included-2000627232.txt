Gamers who love multiplayer online combat games where teamwork is key â thinkÂ Helldivers II or Marvel Rivals â are all too aware that it only takes one laggy teammate to kill an entire mission. It’s not always a slow internet connection or console either â a subpar monitor with a bad refresh time can spell doom for the whole team.
If you end up beingÂ that guy who says “sorry, my screen is slow” one time too many, you might find your team membership revoked. This limited-time Amazon deal that guy-proofs you and ensures your screen is totally ready for combat: Act now and save 30% off the price of the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor, a 1440p QHD gaming superstar with a blistering 260Hz refresh rate, Adaptive Sync technology, and many more features that will upgrade your gaming performance. It’s just $229 while this deal is in effect.

Silky Smooth, Lightning Quick
First things first â the ultra-fast 260Hz overclocked refresh rate and 1 ms pixel response time. No blur, smooth frames, or delay, even in the fastest action of your favorite shooter or racing game. ASUS doubled down on killing the bluir with their ELMB Sync tech (Extreme Low Motion Blur), and adaptive sync options that keeps things moving even if your graphics card is having a hard time. That translates to less tearing.
The colors pop too, and the anti-glare coating is a huge plus if your rig is located with your back to a window. That, of course, comes in handy if you decide to take a break from gaming to enjoy some streaming or YouTube.
Not a Space Hog
The ASUS TUF monitor won’t require a total overhaul of your gaming space either. It’s razor thin and weighs only 11 pounds, meaning it’s also easily wall-mountable of you go that route. The display port and two HDMI 2.0 ports are located in the back of the unit along with an earphone jack, and it comes with DisplayPort and HDMI cables so you can go from unboxing to heavy-duty action in mere minutes.
The 30% off deal happening right now at Amazon on the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor translates to a $100 price break, and also to one of the best $230 gaming monitors you’ll find. Finding a gaming monitor with enough speed to keep up with the most intense action gaming at this price is beyond rare, but as limited time deals do, this one could end at any time.
