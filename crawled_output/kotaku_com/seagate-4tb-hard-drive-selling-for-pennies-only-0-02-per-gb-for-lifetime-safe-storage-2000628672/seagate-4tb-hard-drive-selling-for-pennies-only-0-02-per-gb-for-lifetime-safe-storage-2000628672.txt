There’s no argument really: offline storage remains far more reliable and personal than spending month after month on cloud subscriptions. With cloud services such as Google Drive at around $10 a month for 2TB each and every month, the expense adds up quickly.
An external hard drive like this Seagate 4TB HDD does away with that problem at one stroke: Right now, it’s an all-time low price on Amazon for $99 instead of its normal $124, so you’re paying just $0.02 per gigabyte for storage for life.

Why This Drive Is a Smart Buy
The Seagate hard drive is simple to describe but does all the right things. Behind the scenes, it relies on a USB 3.0 port which offers fast transfer speeds, and it’s plugâandâplay compatible with Windows laptops and desktops as well as Macs. You don’t have to deal with any time-consuming setup or format processes and it allows you to start dragging and dropping files in mere minutes. Beyond computers, it gets along with gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation which gives you an easy way of expanding game storage without needing to replace main drives.
With 4TB capacity, you can store years of photos, home videos, your entire music collection and still have plenty to spare for work documents or even entire game collections. For console players, that might translate to over 100 modern games in a single device without having to erase older games constantly as the new ones are added.
And then consider the long-term cost advantage: Paying around $10 per month for 2TB of online cloud storage (check out a guide here) means within twelve months you’ve paid more than this 4TB Seagate drive costs. With the physical drive, you’re only paying for it once. And on top of that, you retain full ownership of your files, with no worry about renewal subscriptions, cost hikes, or company closures.
Saving documents offline on a hard drive keeps sensitive data away from online threats: Your private photos, finances, or personal archives aren’t floating around in a cloud storage facility that you don’t fully control with the Seagate hard drive. And if the drive does fail, Seagate offers a oneâyear Rescue Data Recovery Service, so you’ve got another safeguard against mishaps or unexpected failure.
Currently selling for $99, this Seagate 4TB external hard drive is one of those deals the more you consider it. If you’re tired of having to keep free plans restricted or raising the cost of subscriptions, paying only $0.02 per GB for lifetime storage is a great opportunity.
