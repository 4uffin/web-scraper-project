Most of us don’t have unlimited space to keep our stuff. Especially if you live in a city, you might find yourself in an apartment without a ton of square footage and have learned that space is a hot commodity. There’s a good chance your desk may not be able to fit some huge PC tower. You need to optimize your workspace by picking a computer that can do what you need without it taking up half the area you have for it. KAMRUI has a series of mini PCs that could be just the trick. The Hyper H2 mini gaming PC is currently on sale for 45% off. That brings the price down from $840 to just $460 for a limited time. You’ll be saving a full $380.

The Hyper H2 from KAMRUI is a mini PC designed for gaming, but how will it fair? Well it’s working with an 11th generation Intel Core i9 8-core,16-thread mobile processor that can turbo up to 4,9GHz. It’s working with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. You storage can be expanded up to 4TB with a compatible SSD.Â KARMUI totes on its product page it can handle large AAA titles as well as multitasking between complex 3D rendering and video editing. That might be a big of an exaggeration with just an integrated graphics card, but I haven’t personally tested to confirm. You’ll probably have some luck running games like Marvel Rivals or Fortnite, but just don’t expect to have your settings on ultra-high.
The mini PC is sleekly designed, coming in a silver-white metal case with orange lines around its edges. Along the outside of the case, you’ll find six USB-A 3.2 ports so you can connect to additional peripherals such as your mouse, keyboard, external storage, or controller. You get one USB-C port, an HDMI port, and one DisplayPort so you can connect to multiple monitors â up to three at once. The Hyper H2 supports displaying in resolutions up to 4K at a refresh rate of 60Hz. It is also equipped with dual-band Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet, and Bluetooth 5.2.
Keep Cool
As a gaming PC this small, your gut expectation might be that this thing will get hot. Luckily, KAMRUI has employed a cooling fan to help maximize heat dissipation while in the heat of battle.
Right now, you can get yourself the KAMRUI Hyper H2 mini gaming PC for nearly half its list price, now just $460.
