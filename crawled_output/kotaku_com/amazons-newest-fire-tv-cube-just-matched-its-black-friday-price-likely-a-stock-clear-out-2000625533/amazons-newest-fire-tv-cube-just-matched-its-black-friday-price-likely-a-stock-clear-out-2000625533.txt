You can make streaming all your favorite movies and shows a seamless experience with the help of a Fire TV. Specifically, the Fire TV Cube which is the most feature-packed streaming device in Amazon’s lineup. Right now, Amazon, has it marked down by a solid 29%. Normally, you’d find the Fire TV Cube going for $140, but after the discount, it comes down to just $100. That’ll save you a whole $40 for a limited time.

The Ultimate Streaming Experience
Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What’s better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It’s sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick’s Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you’re asking. But what if you’re all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way over there? Now you see the value.
The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Maxâthe premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.
With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that’s what it’s called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.
You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you’re ready to try again against Sister Splinter inÂ Hollow Knight: Silksong.Â Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of Bob’s Burgers.
Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon’s Fire TV Cube. You’ll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.
