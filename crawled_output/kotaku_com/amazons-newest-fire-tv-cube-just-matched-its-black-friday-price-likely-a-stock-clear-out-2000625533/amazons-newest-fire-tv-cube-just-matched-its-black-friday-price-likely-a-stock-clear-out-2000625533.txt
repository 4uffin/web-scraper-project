The Ultimate Streaming Experience
Okay, I know what your thinking. Why the cube? What‚Äôs better about the cube than the stick? Well, the Fire TV Cube has a built-in mic and speaker. It‚Äôs sort of a Fire TV Stick and an Echo Dot all in one. With the Fire TV Cube, you can use Alexa hands-free. The Fire TV Stick‚Äôs Alexa support is baked into the remote. You need to hold down a button and speak in for it to register what you‚Äôre asking. But what if you‚Äôre all cozied up under a blanket and the remote is all the way over there? Now you see the value.
The Fire TV Cube also uses an octa-core processor which can provide about twice the power of the Fire TV Stick 4K Max‚Äîthe premium option for Fire TV Sticks. It leads to better performance from your apps like speedier start-up times and faster streaming. And with Wi-Fi 6E support, the upper limit of streaming speeds is pretty dang good.
With any Fire TV, you get to download a wide range of streaming apps so you can keep up with all your favorite content. Get Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max (I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called again last I checked), and Prime Video, of course. Enjoy watching your movies and shows with impressive picture and sound quality thanks to support for cinematic 4K, Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio.
You can connect all your entertainment sources through your Fire TV Cube, allowing you to switch between them. Just use Alexa to ask to pull up your Xbox when you‚Äôre ready to try again against Sister Splinter in¬†Hollow Knight: Silksong.¬†Then when you give up after 20 more tries, you can ask to switch back over to your cable box in time to catch a rerun of the latest episode of Bob‚Äôs Burgers.
Drop the Stick and go for the Cube. Right now, you can save a good $40 on Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV Cube. You‚Äôll only be paying an even $100 for a limited time.
