Premium brands love charging $100, $200, even $300 for Bluetooth speakers but a lot of the time, youâre paying for the label more than the performance. If you want real bang for your buck, the Anker Soundcore 2 is a fantastic choice. Now, with Amazon dropping the price from $45 to just $29, this deal is too good to pass up.

A Pocket Powerhouse That Delivers Where It Counts
The Soundcore 2 isnât your average small speaker: Inside its compact body hides a powerful 12W output, delivered through dual neodymium drivers engineered to produce rich sound even at higher volumes. One of its standout features is the BassUp technology which selectively boosts low frequencies in real time and makes bass tones punchier without causing distortion.
One of the big concerns when buying a portable speaker is durability and resistance to weather conditions: The Soundcore 2 handles that with an IPX7 rating of waterproofing. It’s a level of protection that can keep it underwater for full submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It also makes it easy to clean it upâjust wash off and go.
Ankerâs famed power management combined with a 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery lets this speaker run for up to 24 hours on a single charge. Thatâs enough to last a full day of work or travel without constantly hunting for an outlet. Plus, fast charge technology means youâre back to full power quickly and makes it ready for your next adventure.
Portability is never sacrificed: Tipping the scales at about half a pound and measuring small enough to fit into backpacks, purses, or big pockets with ease, it fits easily in your pocket. The looks are clean and minimalist, and the controls are uncomplicated enough that anyone can become familiar with them quickly. And talking of Bluetooth, the new Bluetooth 5.0 standard ensures reliable and low-latency connections with your device and improved range.
If expensive Bluetooth speakers are out of your budget, then this Anker Soundcore 2 deal shows you don’t have to take out a second mortgage on a quality portable speaker that’s rugged, sounds great, and plays all day on one battery charge.
