Apple Seems to Be Clearing Out the 2025 M4 MacBook Air at an All-Time Low Before Amazon Prime Big Deal Days

Greater minds than ours have been driven crazy trying to predict what’s coming out of Cupertino, and when it’s coming. Now that Apple’s gotten the iPhone 17 and new AirPods drops out of the way, will there be new MacBooks on the horizon? One set of tea leaves to keep an eye on is the deals they’re offering on their current models, and right now seemingly out of nowhere, the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is just $800 at Amazon â its lowest price ever.
Does that mean there’s a new MacBook Air right around the corner? Who knows â early 2026 is a better bet. But this $800 deal on the current flagship of the MacBook Air fleet is very real, and we can’t imagine it going much lower if at all when the 2025 holiday rush starts.

M4 For the Win
One day there will be an M5 chip driving a new line of MacBooks, but until then, you cannot beat the M4 for speed and sheer processing power. This M4 MacBook Air runs twice as fast as the M1 models that were all the rage more recently than we realize, and a staggering 23 times faster than the last Intel powered models of the MacBook Air.
Of course, the one consistent calling card of any MacBook is the display, and this MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen supports a billion colors, all delivered with brilliance and sharpness. Pair that screen with the 12MP Center Stage camera, three microphones, and four Spatial Audio speakers built into the MacBook Air, and your video calls will always be peak. The M4 processor, Spatial Audio speakers, and Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections make the 2025 MacBook Air a streaming and gaming superstar.
Apple-Style AI
The 2025 M4 MacBook Air comes with Apple Intelligence built in, with incredible speed and ability as an assistant for research, productivity, or pretty much anything else you want it to do for you. All those searches are yours and yours alone too, because Apple Intelligence has some of the best and most robust privacy features of any AI system â so private that even Apple can’t get to your search history.
Trying to read the smoke signals from Apple about how and when to jump onÂ the best deal is, honestly, often a waste of time. What we can tell you is that this $800 deal on the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the lowest price ever for this laptop at Amazon, and that the M4 MacBook Air is worth every penny of the price regardless of when the next-gen MacBooks drop.
