LEGO has just rolled out its new Advent calendars, and theyâre giving early shoppers a real treat. Every year itâs the same story: prices are friendliest at launch then as December gets closer, demand sends them climbing back up.
Right now, the LEGO Minecraft advent calendar (2025 edition) is going for only $38 instead of the usual $44. No wonder itâs already the fan favorite among all the LEGO calendars this season, from Harry Potter to Star Wars – but Minecraft is the #1 best-seller on Amazon.

LEGO just released its new Advent calendars, and they’re treating early buyers to a welcome bargain. Year after year: prices are kindest at introduction, then closer to December, demand pushes them on the rise. Currently, the LEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 2025 is available for as low as $38 rather than its normal price of $44.99, which is its lowest ever on Amazon. No wonder it’s already the holiday favorite of all the LEGO calendars available this year, whether it’s Harry Potter or Star Warsâbut Minecraft is in the spotlight.
A Christmas Deal That Brings Minecraft to Life
Why this set is exciting is pretty simple: children and adults like counting down to Christmas, and LEGO and Minecraft is as good a sure bet as you’re ever likely to get. Instead of a second box of chocolates, you’re getting 24 buildable surprises that extend the suspense through the morning. Constructed from 300 pieces, the set creates a full-sized Minecraft world to discover one day at a time.
8 classic Minecraft mini-figures are shipped inside: Alex and Steve are present, of course, but you also get a Creeper, stray, drowned, zombie, snow golem, and even a villager in Santa clothes. They all come with holiday-themed accents that still fit the vibe of the holiday countdown without losing the characteristic Minecraft look.
What’s really cool is the way the pieces interact with one another: There’s something new every day and collectively, they build a Minecraft-themed winter village scene. That playmat background in the box acts as the glue to hold everything together so instead of having 24 separate builds, kids see their own Lego world come together over the space of a month.
This Advent calendar isn’t a separate collection: it’s compatible with the entire range of LEGO Minecraft. For someone who already has Minecraft Lego pieces lying around, this slots right into the existing collection. Kids can expand on their worlds, bridge scenes together or start with it and build something even bigger.
And thereâs more than just nostalgia at play: LEGO calendars like this one donât stick around at low launch prices. Historically, these drop right around release week before climbing steadily into mid-November, as the frenzy for Advent calendars kicks in. Waiting until December almost guarantees youâll pay list priceâor risk a sell-out altogether.
