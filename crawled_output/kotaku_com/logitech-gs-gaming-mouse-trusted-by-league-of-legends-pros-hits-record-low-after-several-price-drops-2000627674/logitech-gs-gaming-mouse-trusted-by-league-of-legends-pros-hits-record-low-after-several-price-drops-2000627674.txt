If you’re sitting at your desk, do me a favor and look around for a moment. What’s your setup look like? Do you have a good keyboard? How are your speakers? How big is your monitor? Is there more than one? When it comes to PC gaming, there’s so may areas you can upgrade, and we didn’t even cover the stuff under the hood like your GPU and CPU. with all the shiny, new products you can buy level up your space, it’s easy to overlook something small but importantâthe mouse.
Your mouse is 50% off how you’re interacting with the games you play, assuming you use mouse and keyboard.Â It’s time to ditch that ten dollar mouse you picked up in the checkout lane of Staples, and get something solid. The Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2 wireless gaming mouse right now goes for $180. However, an Amazon limited time deal is currently bringing it down to just $130. That 28% discount saves you $50.

For the Pros, By the Pros
This Logitech mouse was engineered to be your optimal gaming peripheral. Professional e-sports players were consulted in designing the mouse with rigorous hands-on testing to ensure every curve and click is unmatched.
Designed for speed and precision, this gaming mouse from Logitech has a powerful sensorâthe HERO 2âcapable of an 8 kHz polling rate, an 88g acceleration, an 888 IPS speed, and up to 44,000 DPI sensor calibration. It uses zero-additive PTFE mouse feet, which allows the mouse to glide smoothly across your desktop.
With the Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2, you get five different programmable buttons which can be mapped to anything and allowing you to act more quickly to enemies inÂ League of Legends or whatever is your game of choice.
This mouse has a crazy 95-hour battery life. So long as you remember to plug it in every few gaming sessions, you’ll never have to worry about it dying on you. If your gaming sessions are somehow longer than that, well it may be time to go touch grass. It charges over USB-C.
This Logitech gaming mouse is compatible with both Mac and PC and you have your choice of either black or white. There is a sleek magenta option as well, but that one is unfortunately not part of the sale. So long as you go black or white, you’ll get the mouse for a cool $50 discount. That brings the price down for as limited time from $180 to just $130.
