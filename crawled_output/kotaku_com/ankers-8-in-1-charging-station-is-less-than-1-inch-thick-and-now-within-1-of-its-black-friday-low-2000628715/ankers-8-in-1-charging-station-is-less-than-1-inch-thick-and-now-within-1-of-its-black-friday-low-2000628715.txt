It used to be easy to pick out the most powerful charging stations and power strips. Simply put, bigger was better: The bigger the device, the more plugs it contained; the more plugs it contained, the more power it delivered. Anker’s set that old-school thinking on its ear with their Prime Charging Station, which is just $100 right now thanks to a 33% limited-time deal at Amazon.Â
The Anker Prime Charging Station is definitely not bigger, but it’s definitely better than any of those bulky power strips or charging blocks. With 240 watts of power delivered across 8 outputs that somehow fit in an ultra-compact device that measures 3 x 5.4 inches around and â amazingly â only 0.7 inches thick, it can charge all of your devices while taking up next to no space.

Universal Appeal
The 8 outputs built into the Anker Prime Charging Station cover the full gamut of charging options to cover all of your devices, from your laptop to your wireless earbuds or other small portable tech. There are 2 AC outlets which can pop up or sit level with the charger, 4 USB-C ports, and 2 USB-A ports. Each USB-C port can carry 140W of output, enough juice to take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from completely dead to 53% charged in just 30 minutes.
Even when all six USB ports are used at once, the total output of 237W will quickly and safely charge your devices, and that’s while both AC outlets are also in use. The LED screen at the top of the Anker Prime Charging Station shows you the vital charging statistics, including a countdown timer and if any charging errors occur. The Anker app also shows you those statistics from anywhere and more, and also allows you to fully control the charging station, including creating charging schedules.
Take It To Go
The Anker Prime Charging Station comes with a 5-foot AC power cord, giving you enough slack to place the charging station in your ideal location. It also makes it a great travel charger, especially since the power cord is detachable for easier storage and transport. As with most of Anker’s high-end chargers, the Prime Charging Station comes with ActiveShield 3.0 and PowerIQ 4.0 technology to protect both the charging station and all of your devices from surges, overheating, and other electrical hazards.
Upgrading and downsizing are the same thing when you switch from an outdated power strip or oversized charging station to the Anker Prime Charging Station. It’s just $100 right now at Amazon for a limited time.
