See all those wires cluttering your desktop? Quick â do you know right away where all of them go, and which ones are powering or connecting what device? It sucks when the cable octopus turns into a vicious cable kraken and kills any semblance of organization on your desk, but Amazon’s running a fat deal on the ultimate clutter-killing hub: HP’s G5 11-in-1 dock works with any USB-C or Thunderbolt-enabled laptop or PC, and it’s never been priced lower than it is right now at just $104.
When the opportunity presents itself to give your work or gaming setup the ultimate dose of organization and power management while saving a huge 55% off the regular price of $230, you jump at it. We don’t make up the rules here, we just advise you not to break them.
See at Amazon
Here’s the Lineup
Take another look at your current setup and then read this list of available ports on the HP G5 dock. See how many of your cables will fit in this one unified power hub:
2 DisplayPort 1.4
1 HDMI port
4 USB-A ports (one SuperSpeed)
1 RJ-45 Gig Ethernet
2 USB-C ports (one for data/power out, one to connect to your computer)
1 audio jack
If your desktop or laptop is either USB-C or Thunderbolt compatible (and virtually all of them are now), the HP G5 dock will work with your machine, and work brilliantly. For charging purposes, it brings up to 100W of power to your connected devices. If you’re on a PC, your machine will still get updates pushed through the G5 dock, even if the computer is in sleep mode.
As for the G5 dock itself, it’s an unassuming little device despite that huge number of ports and docks. It’s just 5-by-5 inches square, and stands less than 2 inches tall, so you can tuck it away and effectively hide the source of all of your peripheral connections.
Universal Appeal
The HP name might make you think the G5 dock is a PC-exclusive device, but it works equally well with Macs â anything with a Thunderbolt or USB-C port, across platforms, across desktops and laptops. Anything with the prerequisite hookup can not only be given a dose of cable-management sanity, it can also become a triple-monitor productivity hive.
We’ve seen Amazon run deals on the HP G5 11-in-1 Dock before, and it’s been a solid recommendation every time it comes up. But now that it’s being offered at its lowest price ever â just $104 after a huge 55% price cut â we can’t recommend it more strongly than now.
