The Mac Mini is an interesting little product. You get a full Mac computer but for significantly less than a MacBook or the iMac. So long as you got a screen to connect it to, you‚Äôre good to go. The 2024 Mac Mini powered by the M4 chip normally goes for $599, but right now Amazon has the miniature desktop Mac for $100 off. That 17% discount brings the price down to just $499.
That‚Äôs the starting price. The model down to $499 during this limited time deal comes with 16GB of RAM and an 256GB SSD. For $690, you can double your storage to 512GB.¬† For $904, you can get the model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.

Tiny But Mighty
Apple has redesigned the Mac Mini with this 2024 iteration. The footprint is less than half the size of the previous design, measuring in at five by five by two inches. It fits comfortably on any desktop, taking up hardly any space at all. It‚Äôs carbon footprint is even smaller. Thanks to the ultracompact design, the Mac Mini is Apple‚Äôs first carbon neutral Mac.
A handful of connection options are conveniently found along the front and back of the Mac Mini. You get three thunderbolt ports, two front-facing USB-C ports, an HDMI, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and the headphone jack. That one may no longer be on our iPhones, but lives on at our desks.
MacOS can run all your favorite apps or whatever ones you need to get work done. You get full support for Microsoft 365 as well as the Adobe Creative Cloud software suite such as Photoshop and Premiere. With the M4 chipset, you can expect snappy and fluid performance in any of these applications. Apple‚Äôs MacOS employs a slew of privacy protections to keep your data from being accessed by anyone but you.
If you have an iPhone or other Apple products, you can get them all to work seamlessly together. View and control what‚Äôs on your iPhone from your Mac, or vice versa, with Mirroring. You can copy something from your iPhone and paste it on your Mac. Access you messages or answer FaceTime calls from either device.
For a limited time, you can save anywhere from $95 to $110 on the 2024 model of the Mac Mini powered by the M4 chipset. Get it for as low as $499 over at Amazon. This price reflects the 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD model without AppleCare+ included.
