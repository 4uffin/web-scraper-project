Today, Nintendo treated us to a lovely September Direct, kicking things off with a focus on the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros.Â Where does the time go? Naturally, we saw someÂ Mario games expected to arrive on our Switch 2s and got our first glimpse of next year’s big-screen outing for the Bros. But there was also so, so much more. If you weren’t up at the crack of dawn to watch it yourself, allow us to give you the rundown. Let’s get to it.
The Super Mario Galaxy Movie
Oh hey, there’s a newÂ MarioÂ movie on the way. We got the briefest of looks today atÂ The Super Mario Galaxy Movie.Â There wasn’t a whole lot shown or revealed besides the title and a quick camera sweep through the colorful world of Mario and the announcement that several cast members would be returning including, ugh, Chris Pratt.
Super Mario GalaxyÂ &Â Galaxy 2 Arrive On Switch
If you were hungry for some Wii-era nostalgia, or just missed out on theÂ Galaxy games of the era, Nintendo has good news you for you as it showed off the return of these two beloved titles and some new amiibos based on these adventures.
Super Mario Galaxy &Â Galaxy 2Â land on Switch on October 2.
Mario Tennis Fever
Mario and tennis go back a long way, and some of his outings on the court have been pretty great. Today we got a look at Mario Tennis Fever which includes not just a Mario-ified tennis experience as you might expect, but also an adventure mode that tasks the cast with surviving a tennis-themed adventure as babies.
Mario Tennis Fever arrives on Switch 2 on February 12, 2026.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2 Edition
Wonder‘s wonderfully surreal experience is coming to Switch 2 via a new edition. There’s a ton of new content coming to this version as well when it arrives next year. And Nintendo has produced some physical talking flowers which, um, will spontaneously talk on their own. Fascinating.
Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch 2 edition arrives in Spring 2026.
Yoshi and the Mysterious Book
Can Yoshi read? Turns out he can! In Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, Yoshi’s gonna have to piece together the mysteries of a strange book that’s arrived. But what’s particularly cool about this game, aside from its interesting environmental puzzles, is its quasi-stop-motion-animation style that looks really nice.
Yoshi and the Mysterious Book arrives on Switch 2 in Spring 2026.
Storm Lancers
Played solo or in couch co-op, this side-scrolling platformer is coming to the original Switch. Storm LancersÂ arrives on the original Switch today.
Dinkum
Oh hey! It’s a survival sim! You know the drill, gather stuff, watch out forâholy shitâsharks! Okay, I’m actually really into the blocky animal designs here. I think I’ll spend more time with them than the actual people. Dinkum launches on the original Switch on November 5, 2025.
Popucom
This multiplayer-only, colorful third-person shooter puzzler looks like a neat time with friends. Hopefully you have friends?
Popucom arrives on the original Switch this holiday season.
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream
This weird thing. I don’t say that disparagingly. Today’s Direct showed off Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream‘s character creation and the various activities you can engage in across the island. These voices will end up in your Lynchian nightmares. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches in Spring 2026 for the original Switch.
Partner Showcase 1 Â© Square Enix / Kotaku Following the OG Switch games, Nintendo showed off the following games, some of which we have seen before, but in case you wanted a quick rundown of the release dates, here ya go:

Nintendo Today app
Nintendo’s exclusive Nintendo news app is getting aÂ Kirby theme. Try not to get too hungry for that.
Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics
Friggin’ Virtual Boy. You know you wanted it! Yes, Nintendo has built a new headset for you to insert your original Switch or Switch 2 into and blast your eyeballs with the eternal sea of red. There’s also one made of cardboard on the way. Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics arrives on Switch/Switch 2 on February 17, 2026.
Fatal Frame II Crimson Butterfly Remake
A creepy village that disappeared? The threat of sanity leaving you behind? Hell yeah. If your Switch experience has been sorely lacking some horror, keep this one on your radar.
Fatal Frame II Crimson Butterfly Remake arrives on Switch 2 early 2026.
Partner Showcase 2
One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4, arriving on Switch 2 in Fall, 2025

PowerWash Simulator 2
This game is unreasonably satisfying, and now it features “enhanced soap”? Hell yeah. This version also features four-player online co-op and two-player couch co-op. PowerWash Simulator 2 arrives on Switch 2 in Fall 2025.
Suika Game Planet
This one’s hard to describe, so really just watch the video. But if you can’t, this looks like a satisfying puzzle game tasking you with merging fruit together. Seems like a nice way to kill some time. Suika Game PlanetÂ arrives on Switch/Switch 2 in Winter 2025.
Metroid Prime 4
Our girl’s got a cool bike and a pretty-looking open world of sand dunes to zip around in. Will I finally break down and buy a Switch 2 for this? Maybe. I might also need that Samus bike amiibo. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond arrives on Switch/Switch 2 on December 4, 2025.
Donkey Kong BananzaÂ DLC
If you didn’t get enough of your aggression out smashing up everything in sight inÂ Bananza, lucky you: There’s DLC arriving today for our big ape pal and his buddy Pauline.
Donkey Kong Bananza DK Island &Â Emerald Rush arrives as paid DLC for Switch 2 today.
PokÃ©mon Pokopia
Hey, this PokÃ©mon game looks pretty darn different from the series’ usual shenanigans. In PokÃ©mon Pokopia, you’ll play as a Ditto disguised as a human and, hopefully, build a paradise for the poor little critters that those darn “trainers” keep abducting to force into battle. See? They don’t need human owners.
PokÃ©mon Pokopia arrives on Switch 2 in 2026.
PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A
Don’t worry, if you need to exert your will over creatures we can clearly see are capable of independent, sovereign existence, PokÃ©monÂ Legends: Z-A is on the way for you to get your battles on. PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A arrives on Switch/Switch 2 on October 16, 2025.
PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension
Not yet, Pikachu, it’s not over yet for PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A. Try as I might to be snarky about this series, Pikachu is just too darn cute and awesome to not be tempted by this rad-looking DLC that’s taking evolution to a new level.
A release date for this DLC was not provided.
Danganronpa 2×2: Goodbye Despair
Waking up on a beach with a cute boy asking me if I’m okay? Hell yeah. I haven’t played this game before, but maybe you have, as it’s a rerelease of Danganronpa 2. This version also includes an extra story that hasn’t been seen before. Danganronpa 2×2 arrives on Switch/Switch 2 in 2026.
Dynasty Warriors: Origins Switch 2 release and DLC
The thrill of fighting seemingly countless foes in epic battles is yours to carry around on Switch 2 soon. There’s also some new paid DLC on the way. Dynasty Warriors: Origins and its new DLC arrives on Switch 2 January 22, 2026.
Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection
Hunt your monsters and save the world from ecological collapse. Those two things can’t be possibly related, can they? Monster Hunter Stories 3 Twisted Reflection arrives on Switch 2 on March 13, 2026.

Resident Evil Requiem
Creepy abandoned hallways, an ominous phone call, and one brave-ass girl needing to survive the unsurviveable. Today we got official confirmation that the upcoming, and very good-looking, Resident Evil Requiem is coming to Switch 2. This may not be my platform of choice for the latest in Capcom’s legendary horror series, but I cannot wait for this game. Resident Evil 7 andÂ 8 are also headed to Nintendo’s hybrid console. Resident Evil Requiem arrives on Switch 2 on February 27, 2026, the same day asÂ RE7Â andÂ RE8.
Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave
Today’s Direct closed out the show with Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave. Tactical combat, lovely character design, bitter stories of revenge, and some gorgeous environments combine for what looks like a game very much worth keeping an eye on. Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave arrives in 2026.
And that wraps everything we saw! What games are you looking forward to the most?
