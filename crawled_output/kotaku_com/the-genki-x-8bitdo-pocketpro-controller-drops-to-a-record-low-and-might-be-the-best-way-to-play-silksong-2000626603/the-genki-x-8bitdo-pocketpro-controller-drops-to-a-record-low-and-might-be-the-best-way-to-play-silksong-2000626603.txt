Â© GENKI x 8BitDo
Controllers are my kryptonite. When I see one that looks cool, I gotta have it. I’m embarrassed to say how many 8BitDo controllers I own, but it still will never be enough for me. I’m telling now to join in on the 8BitDo cult as there really is no better controller for indies and retro games than what they’re manufacturing. And what do you know, this one that’s a collab with GENKI just dropped 17%. The PockePro wireless gamepad is normally $60, but after the discount, it comes to just $50. Save yourself a cool $10 and put it halfway toward buying Hollow Knight: Silksong.Â
Eagle-eyed viewers might notice the overall shape and layout of the controller looks a bit familiar. It is indeed designed after the Super Nintendo gamepad, but now with all the modern conveniences like multiple R and L buttons and dual, clickable analog sticks.

The Perfect Tool to Equip for Silksong
And being based on the SNES controller, it has undoubtedly the best d-pad you can get. That makes it perfect for the newÂ Hollow Knight: Silksong.Â If you’re struggling with some of the boss fights or platforming in Team Cherry’s grueling Metroidvania, it might be your controller. First off, stop using the joystick. You’re not going to get the precision to execute those diagonal pogos properly. Though, if you’re using the Nintendo Pro Controller, forget it. That thing is notorious for misregistered inputs. You’ll be dropping all your rosaries into the spikes using that.
ButÂ this d-pad… ThisÂ d-pad on the 8Bitdo’s controllers just sings.
Beyond the d-pad, the joysticks also are an improvement over Nintendo’s. They utilize Hall Effect tech, which used magnets. This means drift is an impossibility. You can use this controller until the Switch 3 comes out and still not experience anything close to the deterioration found on the Switch Joy-Con controllers.
Other useful little features the GENKI x 8BitDo PocketPro has implemented included a turbo mode, gyro controls, and haptic feedback. You can a happy marriage of nostalgic design and advanced functionality. The 8BitDo controller is always the one I grab when playing retro-inspired indie titles likeÂ Celeste orÂ Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge for that reason.
The controller is not just compatible with the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. You can also use it on Window devices, MacOS, Android, or Steam Deck. Due not though that if you plan on using it with the Nintendo Switch 2, it may require a quick firmware update before it can connect. This can be accessed on 8BitDo’s official website.
