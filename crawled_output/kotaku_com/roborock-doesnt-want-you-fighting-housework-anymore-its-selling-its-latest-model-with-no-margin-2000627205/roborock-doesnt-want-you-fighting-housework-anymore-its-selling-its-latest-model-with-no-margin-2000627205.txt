Budget robot vacuum cleaners have three huge complaints. One, they’re never powerful enough so there’s always still some dust and some crumbs left behind. Two, they usually do mopping not so great so you’re left with streaks or worse still, no way to mop. And three, they need constant maintenance because you have to empty them almost every run. The Roborock Qrevo S5V, launched this summer, fixes all of that in one lean machine. Even better, Amazon knocked it down to only $549 (from $899), its lowest price yet, which makes it a deal worth paying attention.

Solves Your Daily Hassles
The new Roborock Qrevo S5V is all about sheer cleaning power: Its 12,000Pa HyperForce suction is several times stronger than many budget models which means it lifts stubborn dirt from rugs, carpets and hard floors. If youâve struggled with pet hair tangling inside brushes, this model is certified to end that frustration. Roborock uses a floating rubber main brush designed to resist tangles, combined with an arc-shaped side brush that sweeps along edges while avoiding hair buildup.
Mopping is no afterthought here, either. Instead of a single plate scratching the floor, the FlexiArm design includes two turning mop pads. They turn around 200 times per minute to buff out stains, down into corners and chair legs. The arm goes so far that the pads can swing into spaces other robots cannot cover. In addition, the mop lifts automatically 10 millimeters when it drives over carpets so you never have soggy rugs. You can control water flow through 30 levels using the companion app to accommodate any floor surfaces, from delicate wood to hard tile.
Then there is the dock which is essentially having an assistant built-in: The device isn’t just dumping the dustbin into a large bin capable of holding seven weeks’ worth of garbage. The device also washes the mop pads with clean water and dries them with warm air so that they don’t smell. You won’t have to top it up as frequently either since the dock will charge the water tank in the robot automatically, giving it enough to clean a massive 3,500 square feet on one fill.
Navigation is accomplished by Roborock through LiDAR scanning: It maps rooms 360 degrees and then plans effective cleaning routes. If you have a multi-level house, it remembers up to four different floor plans and auto-switches as needed. Structured light sensors have obstacle avoidance, so it won’t chomp toy cars, run into cables, or get stuck under chair legs. In the app, you can even define no-go zones when you know a space is too messy.
For a record-low price of $549, the Qrevo S5V positions itself in a very desirable spot. Numerous competitors within the category either skip better mopping, compromise on suction, or lack a good self-maintenance dock. If youâve been waiting for a vacuum and mop combo that truly reduces cleaning stress, this is the most convincing deal so far.
