The Fall semester has already started for college students, so why haven‚Äôt you gotten yourself a laptop yet? You may not need it for Syllabus week, but soon you‚Äôll be sent home with more homework than you can imagine. Get a computer that can handle it without completely depleting your monthly budget. Right now, this HP student laptop is down 77% at Amazon. It‚Äôs list price is $2,800, but the deal is bringing the price to just $645. That‚Äôs a difference of $2,154.
Okay, hey now. That over two thousand dollar discount can‚Äôt be real right? Well, kind of. If we take a look at the price history of this item, we‚Äôll see it‚Äôs only existed on Amazon since June of this year. After a couple weeks, it immediately shot down in price by roughly as much as it has now (mostly around $800). Since then, it‚Äôs been back and forth from a crazy discount like this and its full price, but never back up for more than several days at a time.
See at Amazon
Looking at the specs, the laptop is pretty good‚Äîbut not nearly-three-thousand-dollars-good. It‚Äôs rocking an Intel Core i3 processor, which is fine. It does come with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of internal storage which is really good, but not pushing the starting price up¬†that much.
So what gives? I‚Äôll tell you. Some Amazon sellers will try to give the illusion you‚Äôre getting a better deal than you are. That starting price is just made up. The discounted rate is the real value of the laptop. But now if we‚Äôre looking at that, this laptop had spent most of the Summer at around $800. Now that school has started, it‚Äôs come down to its new lowest price of $646. For this reason, really we can say this HP laptop is on sale for $154 off. That‚Äôs not bad!
The HP laptop has a nice and large 17.3-inch display. This is great not just for getting schoolwork done, but if you‚Äôre in the dorms, you might end up watching a lot of your shows and movies from it too. Good to have a sizeable screen for that. Of course, you can always connect it to a TV or larger display using the HDMI 1.4 port.
What Else Your Getting
Other ports include two USB-A slots, one USB-C, and a good ol‚Äô headphone/mic jack. The HP laptop also supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.0 to easily pair wirelessly to some of your accessories.
Speaking of accessories, the laptop comes with a number of them as a bonus. You get a wireless mouse, and external CD/DVD drive, a full 1TB external hard drive, along with some webcam covers, dust plugs, and a cleaning cloth. All that plus an HP laptop that comes preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro for $646? Sounds like a pretty good deal after all.
