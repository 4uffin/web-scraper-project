Folks, if I know one thing in this world, itâs the lived experience of being a short king. My 5â3â ass has always seen the world from a lower standing than my peers, and itâs rare for me to come across heroes in media who see the world from that same point of view. Wolverine, the X-Man who has pointy metal claws in his knuckles, is one of the few short kings I have to cling to in popular culture, but a lot of people donât realize that heâs supposed to be a little guy. In the comics, heâs my height exactly, but so many people know him from the movies where heâs played by 6â2â actor Hugh Jackman. Deadpool & Wolverine makes a joke about this when, through the magic of filmmaking, Deadpool meets a âcomic-accurateâ version of Logan who needs a booster seat to sit at the bar. Now, however, Wolfie is getting his own game, and thereâs no reason that casting a particular actor has to define the characterâs stature. So has Insomniac stayed true to his short king status? Fans canât seem to agree. Â© Insomniac Games Strictly eyeballing it, Logan looks like heâs definitely of short stature in the trailer that premiered during the State of Play showcase yesterday. Some fans note that he definitely appears significantly shorter than the enemies heâs slicing and dicing, but some donât think thatâs quite enough.Â
my gripe is, why is Logan so tall? He should be short and wide https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9 — â¦ JYDAWN â¦ (@_jydawn) September 25, 2025
Sorry, I just took some mild psychic damage at reading someone say that Logan being short would make him a âtwink,â and I need people to stop trying to use words they donât understand. This is an annoying case of both tall people and straight people bastardizing my culture. Anyway, the weird part of the conversation is that people actually somehow think that a short Wolverine would be inherently weird or comical. The Hugh Jackman bit in Deadpool & Wolverine was a joke because it showed that Jackman himself would look ridiculous if he were made a foot shorter with minimal changes to his proportions, but a 5â3â man can absolutely fuck up some mutant-hunting baddy as well as a man who towers over him.
We need to banish the idea of 5'2 Logan from existence at this point. People were seriously saying this sized Deadpool Wolverine should be the MCU one. I get it, it's from the comic, but sometimes comic things need to die https://t.co/90umBvRLYO pic.twitter.com/X0AwbiohBA — Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) September 25, 2025
Wolverine being 5â2 is legit the worst piece of character lore of all time ngl — Matt b (@hipppyjump) September 25, 2025
Some of this sentiment is rooted in the fact that many people view shorter men as âless manlyâ or some such weird, toxic shit, which makes me very glad I opted out of all of that when I became interested in video games as a kid and men in adulthood. When people say that Wolverine should be a hulking beast of a tall guy, itâs usually because it conforms to some idealized image of what a man should look like. But thatâs boring, and if thatâs your problem, you should grow the fuck up. Wolverine is short in Marvel Rivals, and it rules, actually. But is Logan a proper short king in Wolverine? That we probably wonât know for sure until the game is out and people can rip the models from the files and properly measure him. At the very least the gameplay reveal suggests that, even if Insomniac isn’t keeping Logan a strict 5’2″, they’re also notÂ trying to size him up too much. The studio seems aware that not everyone thinks heâs quite short enough, but shrinking the character model would have a massive ripple effect on nearly every animation in the game, so Iâd be very surprised if Insomniac made a real change this far into development. Maybe as a secret unlockable mode down the line, but for now, the height debate will rage on until Wolverine launches on PS5 in 2026.
