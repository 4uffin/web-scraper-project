Sometimes, in this line of work, a gameâs name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with Love and Deepspace, Papergamesâ 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over 50 million players worldwide. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with a Love and Deepspace scene so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further. Love and Deepspace has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a “deepspace hunter” who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game’s five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the gameâs broader mysteries, but theyâre also, well, interactive.
Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, itâs easy to see why Love and Deepspace has taken off the way it has. Itâs angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men canât. Itâs why Twilight still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a well-documented lover of digital men and romance, I donât think I have the patience for some of Love and Deepspaceâs gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if Iâm not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, “Feel this and remember what I’m giving you” as heâs on top of the player character.

The scene is from a new trailer for the âEdge of Continuumâ event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a âGod of Annihilationâ version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonistâs many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.
Iâm surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for yâall, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, Iâve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.
