A CG-rendered trailer for PUBG Mobile‘s next big update appears to confirm previous rumors that Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be appearing soon in the popular mobile port of the battle royale game. But it also features Sega’s mascot fighting… Skibidi Toilets? On September 24, Sonic Hotspot on Twitter posted what appears to be a real trailer for a yet-to-be-announced or confirmed Sonic crossover event in the long-running PUBG Mobile. This was spotted and sshared by SonicStadium.org on Bluesky. The pre-rendered event trailer shows Sonic the Hedgehog fighting a massive Skibidi Toilet character. Here’s the leaked trailer, and sorry in advance. I was going to link a YouTube re-upload of it, but that has since been removed. Hmm..

Skibidi Toilets, which were created as part of a now massively popular YouTube animated series of shorts, were already announced to be coming to PUBG Mobile later this month, so it’s no surprise they are popping up in a leaked trailer. And Sonic has been rumored to be coming to PUBG Mobile for a few months now. Sega’s beloved mascot was even teased last month in an official PUBG Mobile post promising six new collaborations. So that’s also not a big surprise for fans, but a nice confirmation that he’ll be here soon. However, I don’t think anybody was expecting Sonic’s reveal to include Skibidi Toilets.
There is something deeply depressing about watching Sonic fight a Skibidi Toilet. It feels like my fears that all of pop culture will one day merge together into a single giant, boring blob of content are coming true, and faster than expected. Everything is becoming Fortnite, and because all of this crossover slop is making companies millions of dollars, it’s unlikely to stop anytime soon. And so, that’s how we end up in a timeline where some silly videos made using the Source Engine have become a massively popular IP that has attracted the attention (and money) of Michael Bay. Sonic, you deserve better. We all do. Yet, here we are.
