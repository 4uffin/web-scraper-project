If you’re in the market for a new laptop, be it your a student, a small business owner, or just someone who’d like to access the internet on something other than your phone, turn your attention to this Dell Inspiron 15. It’s got touchscreen controls and comes with some free accessories. Amazon has it listed at $3,000, but is currently marked down to just $880. That’s a whopping 71% discount equating to a savings of $2,120. That sounds too good to be true?
Well, before you get too excited, most things that sound too good to be true generally are. If we look at the price history of this laptop bundle, it’s only been listed on Amazon for about a month. After just a few days, it shot down in price to $900, back up to full price for one day, then dropped again to where it is now.

So what’s going on here? Some sellers like to artificially inflate the list price and then immediately mark it down so it get that big red shiny button that says “Limited time deal” next to a huge percentage discount. Truthfully, when looking at the specs of this computer, it’s not worth nearly $3,000. The discounted price is way more reasonable for what your getting, even when considering the bonus gifts.
What we have here is a 15.6-inch laptop from Dell with a touchscreen display, allowing you to operate it like either a laptop or a tablet. It displays in 1080p HD. The machine is powered by an Intel 10-core i5 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s packed with 64GB of RAM plus a full 2TB of storage on its SSD. It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.
As far as connectivity is concerned, the Dell Inspiron 15 is equipped with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port, and a standard USB 2.0 Type-A port. You can also connect an SD card through the SD card reader to either expand your storage or access camera photos. The HDMI 1.4 slot allows you to connect to a second display. Plus, you get a headphone jack.
Bonus Gifts
The seller has thrown in some extra goodies you may find useful to you. With the laptop, you’ll also get a set of webcam covers, a cleaning cloth, and USB port covers. Those are just meh in my opinion, but it does also come with a laptop sleeve, a USB flash drive. and a stylus pen for the touchscreen. Those you might actually end up using.
