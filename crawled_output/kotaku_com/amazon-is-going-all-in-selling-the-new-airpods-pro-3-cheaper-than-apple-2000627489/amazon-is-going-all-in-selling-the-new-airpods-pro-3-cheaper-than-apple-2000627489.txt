Amazon Is Going All In, Selling the New AirPods Pro 3 Cheaper Than Apple
Apple likely isnât happy watching Amazon play so freely with its prices.

Apple introduced the new iPhone 17 and AirPods Pro 3 just a few days ago, and even though they are available only from Friday, something totally absurd is happening: Amazon of is now offering the AirPods Pro 3 at $239, which is $10 lower than Apple’s current offering. This kind of day-one price reduction by Amazon is unheard of and it’s mind-blowing to see this kind of thing occur so rapidly with brand-new materials.

Better Sound with Clever Features
These AirPods Pro 3 offer what is perhaps some of the best in-ear active noise cancellation available on the market. Apple has raised the stakes with a guarantee to cut out twice as much extraneous noise as the AirPods Pro 2 so when you’re listening with them, you’re fully immersed in your music (check out the AirPods Pro 3 review at Gizmodo here). It’s not just about noise-blocking, though – they’ve completely rebooted the sound experience. The 3D spatial sound creates this amazing depth where you can clearly hear every instrument, the bass is more complete and vocals are heard in glorious detail.
And then there’s the heart rate sensor. Yes, these earbuds don’t only pump sound; they track your heart rate and calories burned during any of up to 50 different workouts. Coupled with the fitness capabilities of your iPhone, including the Move ring and new Workout Buddy, you’ve got a dead serious personal trainer in your ears. Cool, right?
Live translation is fueled by Apple Intelligence and it’s another doozy: That equates to being able to overcome language barriers in real time when you’re chatting with friends or traveling abroad. The feature is intelligent and effortless so conversation is like you shared the same language.
Battery life is also excellent as you can listen for 8 hours with Active Noise Cancellation on, and 10 hours when you’re listening with Transparency mode enabled with Hearing Aid. And new ear tips come in five sizes so you can find your best fit for yourself, with them staying put and sound even better.
With these changes in mind, it’s incredible to think that Amazon is offering them for less than Apple charges. If this combination of features and this price is sounding like a deal too good to resist, that’s because it is. Don’t wait too long – this sale doesn’t last forever.
