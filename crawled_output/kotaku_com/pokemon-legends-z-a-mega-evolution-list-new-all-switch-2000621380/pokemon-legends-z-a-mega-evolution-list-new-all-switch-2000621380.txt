PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A is shaking up the seriesâ formula in more ways than one when it launches in October. Itâs got real-time combat, it all takes place in one city rather than an entire region, and it has a new take on multiplayer to take advantage of that new battle system. Even with all this newness, perhaps the most exciting thing Game Freak is adding is more of something old: Mega Evolutions. These superpowered temporary transformations have long been one of PokÃ©mon fansâ favorite battle gimmicks from over the years, and since weâre heading back to Kalos, their region of origin, what better time than now to add a wave of new Mega Evolutions? A list of possible new forms leaked earlier this year, and so far it seems to be mostly accurate, but Nintendo has subverted everyone’s expectations in the latest Nintendo Direct by announcing a separate DLC that may add even more Mega Stones to the mix. Here are all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Mega Dragonite
Mega Dragonite was the first new form revealed for Legends: Z-A. It emphasizes traits from its pre-evolution, Dragonair, by including a jewel on its tail and adding wings to the sides of its head. It maintains its Dragon/Flying typing, but becomes exceptionally faster and stronger in this form. Mega Dragonite views taking out an enemy quickly as an act of kindness, and has a jolly big smile when it uses powerful attacks because it knows all this violence will be over soon. It’s basically Superman. Mega Victreebel
PokÃ©mon used a spooky found footage video to reveal Mega Victreebel, but if you take it out of that environment, it is one of the goofier looking Mega Evolutions in the series. The pitcher plant PokÃ©mon’s body has become so engorged with acid that it ties one of its own vines around its throat in order to contain all of it within its bulbous stomach. Now it hops around on its belly as it stalks its prey and loosens the grip around its neck when it needs to projectile vomit its acid onto an enemy.
Mega Hawlucha
Hawluchaâs new Mega form is probably the most straightforward one weâve seen thus far. It gets buff like it’s been downing creatine, dons a new mask and cape combo, and its feathers form a belt around its waist. Mega Hawlucha also gets a signature move called Flying Press that it used on Machamp in its reveal cinematic.Â  Mega Malamar
Mega Malamar got the red carpet treatment ahead of its reveal, but that is all of its own design, as the squid-like creature was hypnotizing people into loving it. The new form literally expands Malamar’s brain and causes its slender body to glow like your favorite gamer keyboard. Its psychic power has become so overwhelming that it is able to completely rewrite people’s personalities.
Mega Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja
After getting the shaft back in Pokemon X and Y, the Kalos starters are all getting Mega Evolutions in Legends: Z-A. All three of them appear to be maintaining their original typing, but each of them got a bit of a glow-up in the transformation. Chesnaught now wields an axe-like weapon that it can remove from its back and swing at enemies, Delphox goes full Elphaba and rides a broom to lean into its witch theme, and Greninja…turns upside down as it hangs from a giant water shuriken. Unfortunately, each of them will only be available in Legends: Z-A through online battles and seasonal rewards, so you wonât be able to get them right out of the gate and youâll have to climb the ranks to get their Mega Stones. Bummer. Mega Raichu X and Y
After a decade of me whining about it, Game Freak is finally throwing Raichu a bone. The electric mouse is getting not one, but two Mega Evolutions through Legends: Z-Aâs Mega Dimension DLC. Weâll have to wait until some time post-launch to use either of them, but their designs both seem like a mash-up of Raichu and its pre-evolution Pikachu, similar to some Mega concepts like Dragonite and Ampharos. Mega Raichu X is a physical attacker with big paws, an electromagnetism-powered floating body, and two Pikachu-like tails, while Mega Raichu Y is a speedy special user that looks a lot like Pikachu but with a Raichu-like tail and big lightning-bolt horns.
Thatâs all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Game Freak will no doubt reveal more between now and when PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A comes to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Will Mega Raichu be among them, or will I be made to suffer another slight for my favorite electric rodent? We all know the answer. I donât need you to rub it in.Â  (Update: Nevermind, they did it.)
