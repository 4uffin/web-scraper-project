Portable power stations are basically power banks amplified designed to charge all your devices and even serve as back-up power in case of a power outage. They’re really handy, surprisingly light and convenient to take with you wherever you go. Today, on the eve of Prime Day, Amazon has slashed the price on the Jackery Explorer 1000 (v2) to an all-time low of only $448, down from its normal $799 which is a fantastic deal for anyone looking for trustworthy portable power on the move.

The Power Bank That Travels Everywhere
The Jackery Explorer 1000 is a portable powerhouse that can pack serious punch without weighing you down. Its 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery life means you have enough juice to power multiple appliances like your AC unit, refrigerator, or electric stove, making it a camp lifesaver, road trip companion or emergency power outage rescuer. All that power and yet it only weighs 23.8 pounds and comes with a foldable handle so you can simply grab and leave whenever.
One of the things that is truly awesome is the 1,500W continuous AC output and 3,000W surge power which makes it possible for it to start devices that need a pre-initial power boost and keep them running effectively. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver which allows you to charge the entire device from zero to full in as little as one hour when you’re using emergency charging through the Jackery App. Typically, the unit charges in approximately 1.7 hours to maintain battery health, trading speed for smart care with the advanced ChargeShield 2.0 technology.
With two USB-C, one USB-A, a DC automobile port, and three true sine wave AC outlets, the Explorer 1000 can power an array of devices simultaneously (smartphones, laptops, cameras, and even small appliances). The 100W USB-C Power Delivery port assures rapid charging of compatible devices without requiring cumbersome power adapters, further enhancing the convenience in being able to go anywhere or respond to unforeseen power failures in your home.
If there was ever a time to take advantage of a portable power station that will never let you down, that time is now with this record-low price.
