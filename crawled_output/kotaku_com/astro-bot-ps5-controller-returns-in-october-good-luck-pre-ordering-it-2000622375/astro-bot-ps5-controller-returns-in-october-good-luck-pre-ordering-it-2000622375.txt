Last year, Sony released a new PS5 Dualsense controller themed around the then-upcoming platformer Astro Bot. The game was a huge hit with critics and fans, as was the controller, which sold out quickly and became hard to find. But now, a slightly tweaked version of the popular gamepad is returning in October with pre-orders later this month. On September 2, after some teasing in July, PlayStation revealed that the new ‚ÄúJoyful‚Äù version of the Astro Bot PS5 controller was officially launching just before Halloween, on October 30. And gamers who missed out on buying an Astro Bot controller last year will have a chance to pre-order the new version on September 12 at 10 a.m. local time via PlayStation‚Äôs own online store and ‚Äúparticipating retailers.‚Äù
Astro Bot returns with a new delightful twist!

This isn‚Äôt the same controller that was sold back in 2024 and quickly gobbled up and scalped on eBay for more than twice the price. Well, it‚Äôs mostly the same controller. The only real difference is the touchpad. On the OG Astro Bot gamepad, the eyes were open and always watching you play. This time around, the eyes are slightly closed, simulating joy and happiness. It‚Äôs a bit less creepy, which is nice.
No price was shared for this new version of the controller, but last time PlayStation sold the Astro Bot Dualsense controller, it was priced at $80. Still, the new Astro Bot pad might cost a bit more. The boring and ugly Last-of-Us-themed Dualsense controller from Sony cost $85 earlier this year. Whatever it costs, you can expect it to go for much more when resellers inevitably grab up a ton of them and sell them on eBay. Heck, the original Astro Bot Dualsense controller still goes for $110 to $160 sealed on the internet‚Äôs ancient auction house. So if you really want a joyful Astro Bot-themed Dualsense controller and you don‚Äôt want to pay $200 or whatever, I‚Äôd be hanging out at your computer on September 12, ready to pre-order the moment they go live. Good luck with that!
