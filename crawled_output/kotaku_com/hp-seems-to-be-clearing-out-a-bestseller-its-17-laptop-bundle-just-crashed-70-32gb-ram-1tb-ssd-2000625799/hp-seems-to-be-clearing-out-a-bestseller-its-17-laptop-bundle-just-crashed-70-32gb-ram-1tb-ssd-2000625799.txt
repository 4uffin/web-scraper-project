Looking to upgrade that rinky dink laptop of yours? Direct your attention to Amazon. This HP listing comes bundled with a whole bunch of extra accessories including a wireless mouse, webcam covers, a cleaning cloth, an external DVD drive, USB port covers, and a portable 1TB SSD. The whole set is marked down from $3,000 to just $900. Wowie, that‚Äôs a 70% discount amounting to a savings of $2,100.
Okay, so peak behind the curtains of online retail‚Äîthe percentage off is never real. What I mean by that is Amazon is filled with a lot of laptop bundles that throw is some small accessories. Some of them you might use, like the wireless mouse. Some you never will, like the dust plugs.

What sellers on Amazon like to do is take decent laptops, add in some freebies, set the price at an astronomical high and then immediately cut three quarters of it off with a sale.
That‚Äôs exactly what happened here. The price history only shows as far back as the beginning of September. On September 2, it got cut 70%.
Why do they do this? Shoppers will see the big red label marking ‚Äúlimited time deal‚Äù with a huge percentage next to it then go blind to everything else. But not you and me. We‚Äôre smarter than that.
What you need to do is judge these bundles at the price they are at like that‚Äôs their MSRP. If we just consider this as an $900 laptop with some bonus gifts thrown in, what you‚Äôre getting for the price is still pretty good, actually.
What You‚Äôre Getting
So what we have here is a 17.3-inch laptop, displaying in an HD resolution of 1920 by 1080. It‚Äôs a touchscreen so you can choose to operated it like a laptop or a tablet. The laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro. It‚Äôs powered by a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 and comes with 32GB of RAM and a full 1TB of storage on its internal SSD. That ain‚Äôt bad! Plenty of room to store thousands of photos, videos, or documents of any kind.
The laptop supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.4. You can connect to additional accessories using the variety of ports along the sides. You‚Äôll find¬† two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, an HDMI 1.4 slot, and an audio jack to connect headphones, desktop speakers, or a microphone.
HP equipped this laptop with a 720p HD front camera along with integrated dual array digital microphones. You can hop into a Zoom call or other video chat with friends or family, then use one of the included webcam covers to protect your privacy when not in use.
