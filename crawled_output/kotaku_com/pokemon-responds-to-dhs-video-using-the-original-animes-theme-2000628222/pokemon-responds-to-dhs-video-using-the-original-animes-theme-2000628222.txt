On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security posted a gross video of ICE making multiple arrests set to the original PokÃ©monÂ anime’s theme song, as well as using interstitial cuts of the show and displaying mock-ups of trading cards for several of the individuals arrested. After millions of people saw the video and called on Nintendo or The PokÃ©mon Company to pursue legal action, the company has issued a statement to Kotaku. âWe are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand,” the statement reads. “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.â

The statement stops short of mentioning whether the company plans to take any further action. Doug McGowan, Pokemon‘s ex-legal chief, toldÂ IGNÂ that if he were still working with the company, he “wouldn’t touch this” case for a few reasons. “I don’t see them doing anything about this for a few reasons,” McGowan told IGN. “First, think of how little you see [The PokÃ©mon Company International]’s name in the press,” McGowan told IGN. “They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand. “Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn’t touch this, and I’m the most trigger-happy [Chief Legal Officer] I’ve ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.” It’s probably the safer course of action, but it’s certainly not the more principled one considering The PokÃ©mon Company has pursued legal action for far less egregious offenses. But hey, at least it’s putting all its legal team to good use by patenting mechanics and suing knock-off monster-catching franchises, right?
