Since the launch of Borderlands 4 earlier this month, the game has suffered from performance issues on both console and PC. Players have also been upset about the lack of a field-of-view slider on console. Well, good news, Gearbox’s latest patch for Borderlands 4, out now on all platforms, adds the missing FOV slider, improves performance and stability, and fixes a ton of other issues, too. On September 25, Gearbox published the lengthy patch notes for Borderlands 4‘s latest free update. And there’s a lot to go through, but the biggest news for many console players is that Gearbox has added an FOV slider to the game. This had been one of the main requests from players, and something Gearbox has been working on since launch. Just a heads-up that increasing the FOV in Borderlands 4, like in any game, could lead to performance issues. Speaking of performance issues, the patch notes don’t specifically mention a fix for the issue of the game running worse on consoles after extended play, but it does make mention of “various” fixes for “hitching, low FPS, and crashes.” So hopefully that helps and means I don’t have to restart my PS5 Pro every so often to play Borderlands 4 at 60fps. Another bug that is supposedly squashed is the problem of missing weapon icons when using your menu or inventory. This happened to me a lot on PC and to a few friends of mine on PS5. Oh, and for all you fans of the Doom-inspired Hellwalker shotgun, Gearbox has confirmed that the gun not being a fire elemental weapon was a mistake, and all future Hellwalkers will come with fire pellets. Tiny fix, but one that I love. And that’s not all. While this update makes a few tweaks to the playable vault hunters, Gearbox has confirmed that there are even more buffs coming in a different Borderlands 4 patch next week. No word on nerfs to the popular knife build or the super jump, which is nice. It seems these broken strats are safe…for now. Oh, and in case you didn’t hear, the Switch 2 port of the game has been delayed. At least it will launch with all of these fixes on day one. Anyway, here are the full patch notes:
Stability And Performance
Improvements to stability and performance. Addressed various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes. We are continuing to investigate and will make further improvements to stability and performance. Updated character animations for performance improvements. Graphics Preset could be set to High or Very High when using Run Auto-Detect in Visual Menu. [Xbox] Corrected an issue where players would get a black screen after the Vault Symbol loading screen. Addressed rare issues of infinite loading screens during crossplay. Improved loading of characters in menus to reduce visible delays when entering character select.
Rewards And Progression
Addressed a reported issue where players could lose or be rewarded unintended extra Skill Points in multiplayer. Addressed an issue that could prevent Contract target enemies from consistently spawning. Updated Repkit lifesteal challenge to track lifesteal from any source. Prevented region discovery trophies/achievements from unlocking before discovering all areas. Prevented instances of unowned DLC content appearing in chests or in menus. Improved clarity of DLC-related warnings and reward availability. Addressed a reported issue where the Reward Center could stop working after claiming the Gilded Glory Pack rewards.

Updated theÂ Break Free Pack reward bundle to redeem properly in all instances. Challenge timing has been updated so players can properly progress from Ultimate Vault Hunter (UVH) 4 to UVH 5 after completing the required Wildcard Mission.
When ranking up in multiplayer, players that are not the host will not see the change to their UVH level, but will be able to switch to the higher level. This will be addressed in an upcoming update.
