Having a work-from-home job doesn’t necessarily mean you need to always be workingÂ from home. You feasibly have the power to work from anywhere in the world so long has you have stable Wi-Fi. The thing that used to get in the way of me getting out more often with my laptop is that I don’t like working off just my laptop screen. At my desk, I have spoiled myself with three large monitors and can see everything I’m working on at once. On my laptop, I’m caught flipping through endless tabs and apps, losing track of what I’m looking at constantly. But now, I have gotten myself a portable monitor. You can too as this one from ASUS just dropped on Amazon from $209 to just $169. That 19% discount will save you a solid $40.

Get Out More
For the worker that wants to get out and about more, ASUS’ portable monitor is perfect at it’s 15.6-inch display size. If you decide to head over to your local coffee shop or maybe get some work done in your hotel room while traveling, you can simulate your desktop experience, being able to view more of what you want to have access to at once. You can have the spreadsheet your building out on one display while you have your email or Slack opened up on the second as not to miss any pings coming your way. Or instead you can mute any incoming notifications and use your second monitor to watch the latest episode ofÂ Peacemaker while putting slides together for your next presentation on the first one.
The ASUS monitor has a built-in kickstand, making it easy to prop up. It can be setup in either landscape or portrait mode. I’m a big champion of the vertical display. Having your email or slack set up vertically just makes more sense than landscape. You can see more of your messages at once and be able to read more of those longwinded emails before you need to scroll down again.
The monitor supports a hybrid-signal, meaning the USB-C allows for the transmission of both video and power. This is wonderful because it means you’ll have less cables running across your workspace. It just needs the one USB-C cable connected from your laptop and that’s enough to turn on the portable ASUS monitor and send the video feed to it.
If you want to use the ASUS monitor as a more permanent secondary monitor, you’ll be happy to learn it is tripod hold compatible, letting you mount the display.
