After some rumors and speculation suggesting weâd be getting one ahead of Tokyo Game Show, Sony has announced a new State of Play presentation for tomorrow, September 24. The showcase will include 35 minutes of new games, both from third-party developers and Sony’s PlayStation Studios. The only game we know will be in the show right now is Saros, the new game from Returnal developer Housemarque. The action game was first revealed back in February and features iZombie and Fall of the House of Usher actor Rahul Kohli as the lead actor. Itâs set to come to PlayStation 5 next year. I’d be shocked if we got a release date tomorrow, but we will see at least five minutes of gameplay. The show will begin tomorrow at 2 p.m. Pacific / 5 p.m. Eastern, and will be streaming on PlayStation’s YouTube and Twitch accounts. After so many long showcases this summer, it’s nice to get something that’s only 35 minutes long. Thank you, Sony, for your mercy, especially because this is taking place after typical working hours for those of us on the East Coast.
Beyond Faros, itâs unclear what games might make an appearance. Ghost of YÅtei is a little over a week away, so it would make sense for Sony to spend a little time promoting the game and reminding people that the samurai sequel is imminent. Iâm sure someone at Sony thinks it could use some positive buzz after the past couple of weeks of controversy. Iâd be surprised if they spent too much time on it, though, considering itâs about to get another wave of chatter when reviews go live later this week. Thoughts and prayers to the Kingdom Hearts fans who are no doubt hoping weâll hear more about Kingdom Hearts IV tomorrow. I am on your side, but I cannot bring myself to actually feel hope.
