This isn’t designed for high-end computing like doing any kind of 3D modeling or 4K video editing, but it’s great for “everyday” computer tasks. If you’re someone who really just needs a PC capable of receiving and sending emails, watching YouTube videos, or working within any of the basic Microsoft Office apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel, then this miniature computer will do the trick just fine.
The KAMRUI mini PC is capable of connecting to three different displays at once, each able to achieve a resolution of 4K and refresh rate of 60Hz. It’s got support for DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, and video and audio transfer over USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C. Beyond those ports, you also have six USB-A ports to connect various accessories and peripherals. You also get Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2.
Why Go Mini?
Even though many TVs just have built-in streaming apps, and media players like Fire TV and Roku are fairly cheap to come by, you still may want to opt for powering your home theater with a mini PC instead. You’ll be able to handle a wide range video formats, plus you can play media saved locally. Plus, it’s small form factor allows it to easily be hidden behind your TV or within your entertainment center.
Lots of users find mini PCs to be a great option for setting up a PLEX server so you can access your media files from anywhere. Mini PCs also make for wonderful emulation machines as retro game software doesn’t require much processing power. Just be sure your ROMs are all legally acquired.
For a limited time, you can secure yourself one of these KAMRUI mini PCs for a whole $101 off. The $400 mini PC has come down to just $299 for the time being.
