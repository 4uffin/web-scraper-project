If you’re of a certain age, you might remember the “you got chocolate on my peanut butter” commercials for Reese’s. “You put charging ports in my monitor stand” might not have the same catchy ring to it, but the result is the same â two great items combining to create one unbeatable one, like the Anker 675 USB-C Docking Station and Monitor Stand, which is at an all-time low price of $170 right now at Amazon. As desktop multitasking goes, this is next-level stuff.
The Anker 675 is sturdy enough to securely hold a heavy monitor like the Apple Cinema Display and give it a 3.5-inch boost to improve your posture, and it’s packed with 12 ports for charging, high-speed data transfer, 4K monitor support, and more. There’s built-in cord management on the underside of the stand so you can conceal your many cords and still have room to slide your keyboard underneath for an even more-organized desktop.

Stand and Deliver
The ports of the Anker 675 are divided between one end of the stand and ones located beneath the stand for flexible arrangement. They’re all connected to your laptop via one USB-C connection which is also a 100W fast charger that keeps your laptop fully charged the whole time.
The HDMI, Ethernet, USB-C host connector, power-in port, and one 45W USB-A port are concealed on the underside of the stand, while the outside of the stand holds two USB-C ports (10Gbps data transfer, 45W combined power), two USB-A ports (both 10Gbps; one 7.5W, one 4W), an audio jack, and SD and microSD card slots with 104 MB/s data transfer power. Lest we forget, there’s also a Qi wireless charging pad atop the stand, with a 10W max and 7.5W for wireless iPhone charging â one more wire you can do away with for good.
What Can’t It Do?
Excellent question, and we’re coming up short finding faults with the Anker 675. Anker may be somewhat Apple-centric, but Windows 10 and 11 laptops are equally at home as any MacBook running macOS 10.14 or higher. The HDMI port supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, and the entire apparatus is pure plug-and-play. Did we mention it holds a heavy monitor and gives you a hiding spot for your keyboard and mouse?
The Anker 675 USB-C Docking Station and Monitor Stand is the tech chimera your workstation needs, and your neck will thank you for giving your monitor a posture-improving boost. Amazon’s 32% off deal drops the price of this amazing hybrid accessory down to just $170, which is a can’t-miss proposition.
