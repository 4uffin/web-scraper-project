As the weather starts cooling down and we start spending incrementally more time indoors week after week, there’s never been a better time to get yourself an iPad. Whether you plan on using it to catch up on emails, to doomscroll on your preferred social media app, or to just pour more hours intoÂ BalatroÂ but on a larger screen than your phone, the Apple iPad Air might be what you’re looking for. This 2025 model iPad normally starts at $599, but Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing the price down by 25%. This $150 savings means you’ll only have to pay as low as $449.
This $449 discounted price is for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model. There are three other storage sizes availableâeach with their own $150 discount. You can get the 256GB model for just $549, the 512GB model for just $749, or the 1TB model for just $949. If you want to add on cellular, the discounts are slightly different. The 128GB, 256GB and 1TB models are down $150 still but the 512GB model is only down $84.
For all combinations of storage or cellular capabilities, you can choose between four stylish colors. Pick either blue, purple, space gray, or starlight.

Powerful Performance
So AI has been a pretty big buzzword this past year. Will it be the future of consumer tech? Or is it just a speculative fixation like we went through with NFTs. We’ll find out in due time. Though for right now, Apple and companies like it have promised a ton to consumers with the inclusion of their own proprietary AI models they’re sticking into their products. Apple has Apple Intelligence which can be used to help you craft messages, generate images, and things of the like. The M3 chip is powerful enough to make local processing for Ai models such as this possible.
Beyond AI, the M3 chip allows for improved performance on power-hungry apps, letting you run them side-by-side with each other with no hiccups. Graphically intensive games also get a boost.
To get the full use out of your Apple iPad Air, you can pick up the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately). Use it to quickly jot down notes, draw or edit photos, and more. It’s compatible with tons of productivity and art apps on the App Store.
Finally get yourself that iPad you’ve been telling yourself you would with the 2025 model iPad Ai powered by Apple’s M3 chipset. Most versions are on sale right now for $150 off.
