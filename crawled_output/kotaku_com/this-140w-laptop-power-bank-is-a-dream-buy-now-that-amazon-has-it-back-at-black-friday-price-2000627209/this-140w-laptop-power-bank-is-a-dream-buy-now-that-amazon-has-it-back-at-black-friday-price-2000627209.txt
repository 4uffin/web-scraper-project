There are thousands of power banks on Amazon, but most of them fall between 5W and 60W. That is fine if all you do is charge a phone but when it comes to laptops and bigger devices, they are not much use. The Anker 737 power bank is in a league of its own and it is able to charge nearly everything you own – the new iPhone or a MacBook. And right now, Amazon has cut it down to $87 (from $109), an all-time low price under the $100 threshold, which is why that it is currently the best-selling product in its category.

The Power Bank That Charges Everything
At the core of the Anker 737 lies its huge capacity and speed: Carrying a gargantuan 24,000mAh battery, it has the juice to charge an iPhone 17 Pro from zero all the way up more than four times. Need to charge an iPad Pro or a MacBook? It can do that too, more than once over so you will not be scrambling to find an outlet on road trips. The difference from an average power bank is noticeable day one, because with them you usually need to ration juice.
And there’s the speed: The 737 model supports 140W fast charging via Power Delivery 3.1, something that’s usually reserved for laptop-only charger like devices. This lets you go from nearly dead, empty MacBook to usable in a hurry even when you’ve got other devices along for the ride. To get that kind of speed, you’ll need a 5A USB-C cable and a hefty 140W wall adapter to get the job done. But once you’ve got that, the experience is silky.
Another clever thing is the clever display on the device: Instead of guessing how much battery you have remaining or when you’ll be ready to go again, the digital readout on the screen shows real-time figures like power in and out and an estimate of time remaining to charge. For those who are lugging a number of devices, that sort of openness spares heartache and allows you to plan more effectively.
Yes, portability matters, and despite all its muscle, the Anker 737 still fits into a bag. It’s about 6 inches long and 22 ounces, so it’s easily portable on a vacation and, most importantly, does fit under TSA guidelines for carry-on luggage. That means you can bring it on a plane without any problem, which isn’t the case with most large power banks.
Three charging ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) mean that you can charge a few devices at once so you charge a laptop, phone, and earbuds at the same time instead of switching between them. That sort of freedom when you’re fully powered is what sets the Anker 737 power bank apart from the sea of tiny batteries that only get to keep one or two devices charged gradually. Add on top of that Anker’s excellent two-year warranty and many-year record of customer service, and there’s reassurance in the box.
Power banks are everywhere, but power banks like this one are not. If your definition of peace of mind is never running out of juice on your most important devices, now is the time to buy one.
