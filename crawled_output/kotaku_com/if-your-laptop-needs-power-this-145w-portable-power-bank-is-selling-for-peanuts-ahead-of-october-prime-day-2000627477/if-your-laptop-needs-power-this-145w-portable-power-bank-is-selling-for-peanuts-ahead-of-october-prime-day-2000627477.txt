Small power banks normally only do as much as charging up phones, and that’s it. However, if you want a small charger that also can charge your laptop, this Ugreen 145W 25,000mAh model is something to consider. It’s rather revolutionary in its segment and is being sold in store on Amazon as an early Prime Day deal: Right now, it’s dropping to an all-time low price of $66, down from $99.

Compact Powerhouse with Laptop-Level Charging
Ugreen’s power bank doesnât just handle phones but it also tackles laptops and other high-demand devices with ease. Equipped with a massive 25,000mAh battery, it offers enough juice to fully recharge laptops about 1.3 times and phones up to 5.2 times.
What distinguishes the model is its turbo-speed 145W charging through PD3.1 and QC3.0 technology. Standout is the USB-C1 port, which has a capacity of up to 140W. That equates to charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 56% in 30 minutes which is a quick pace for a portable charger. Besides that, there is two-way fast charging, meaning with a 65W or higher charger, you can easily top-up the power bank itself in roughly 2 hours.
The convenience factor is also very high with a very slim and light weight design that can be carried in any backpack or even a large pocket. There is a digital showing that displays the battery level clearly, so you will never be left stranded by low power at a critical time.
For $66 on Amazon with a 34% discount, it’s an all-time low price for a portable charger with serious power without serious bulk.
