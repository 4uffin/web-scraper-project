Sony was probably saving this announcement for the September State of Play but it’s leaked ahead of time. According to Dealab’s billbil-kun, October’s big PS Plus game is Alan Wake 2Â joining the service on October 7. The survival horror GOTY contender came out two years ago next month and catapulted Alan Wake into the ever-expanding Remedyverse following the success of Control before it. The mind-warping metanarrative will be part of the Essentials tier, meaning everyone who has even the cheapest PS Plus subscription option will be able to download and play it as long as they stay paying members of the service. Alan Wake 2 follows FBI agent Saga Anderson as she investigates a cult responsible for a string of murders in Bright Falls. Coming out 13 years after the original, the sequel takes place that long after the original, too, picking up where the prior game’s narrative threads left off and only getting way weirder from there. If you’re planning on giving Alan Wake 2 a spin next month, you’ll definitely want to make sure you’ve completed the original game first. The first game is available to revisit via a remaster released a couple years back. The good news is it’s currently on sale for just $5 on PS5 and PS4, but you only have another day to claim it at that price. The sale ends after September 25.
Update 9/25/2025 2:25 p.m. ET: Sony did indeed reveal the Alan Wake 2 news at yesterday’s State of Play. It also confirmed other games coming to PS Plus in October. The other two are Goat Simulator 3 and Cocoon, one of my personal favorite puzzle games of the last five years. Sony also confirmed that The Last of Us Part II Remastered will be added to the PS Plus Extra tier on September 26, while Tekken 3, Soul Calibur 3, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary will join the PS Classics part of the Premium subscription tier next month.
