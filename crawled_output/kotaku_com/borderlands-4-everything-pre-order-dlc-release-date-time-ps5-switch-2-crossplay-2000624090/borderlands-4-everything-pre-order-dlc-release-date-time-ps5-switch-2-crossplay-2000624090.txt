What versions of Borderlands 4 are available to buy?Â  The are three versions of Borderlands 4 being sold by 2K. The standard edition is $70 and comes with the game and…that’s it. Then there’s the Deluxe Edition, which costs $100 and comes with the Bounty Pack bundle and Firehawk’s Fury Weapon Skin bundle. (The Bounty Pack includes a few smaller narrative DLC missions that will be added post-launch via various updates.) Finally, the $130 Super Deluxe Edition comes with everything previously mentioned, and grants access to new upcoming expansions, two new Vault Hunters, and a new cosmetic bundle.
Regardless of which version you buy, if you pre-order before Borderlands 4 launches on your platform, you’ll also get a bonus “Gilded Glory” pack that includes:
1 Vault Hunter Head usable by all Vault Hunters 1 Vault Hunter Skin usable by all Vault Hunters 1 Weapon Skin 1 ECHO-4 Drone Skin 4 pieces of Legendary Gear: 1 Lvl 1 Legendary Maliwan SMG 1 Lvl 30 Legendary Ripper Grenade 1 Lvl 30 Legendary Torgue Ordnance 1 Max Lvl Legendary Daedalus Assault Rifle
Does Borderlands 4 support crossplay and cross-save?Â  Yes and no. Borderlands 4 on all platforms will support crossplay at launch. So if you are on PC and your friend is on Xbox, you can play together easily, assuming you both have free Gearbox Shift accounts. Sadly, neither cross-save nor cross-progression will be available on day one. But, Gearbox has confirmed in a Steam post that it is looking to add the features later, letting players hop from one console to another and keep all their progress. Just don’t expect that on September 12.
Is there a day-one patch?Â  Yes! Gearbox CEO and co-founder Randy Pitchford has confirmed that, like most big AAA video games these days, Borderlands 4 will have a day-one patch. According to Pitchford, the update should help improve the game’s performance on PC, but did warn that Borderlands 4 is a big open-world game that might not run well on older hardware even after the update. What are Borderlands 4′s recommended and minimum PC specs?Â
Minimum:
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system OS:Â Windows 10 / Windows 11 Processor:Â Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Memory:Â 16 GB RAM Graphics:Â NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT / Intel Arc A580 Storage:Â 100 GB available space Additional Notes:Â Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required
Recommended:
Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system OS:Â Windows 10 / Windows 11 Processor:Â Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X Memory:Â 32 GB RAM Graphics:Â NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT / Intel Arc B580 Storage:Â 100 GB available space Additional Notes:Â Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. SSD storage required
Will Borderlands 4 run at 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox?Â
Yes.Â  According to Pitchford, Borderlands 4 is targeting 60FPS on Xbox and PlayStation. Meanwhile, Borderlands 4 on Switch 2 seems to be targeting 30FPS, which isn’t surprising.
Target 60fps. Also, Fâ balance. Make a sick build with some god drop loot and melt bosses. Be a legend. https://t.co/FgvuqM77II — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) May 10, 2025
Do I need to play the other Borderlands games? If you want to know all the lore and be a Borderlands expert before Borderlands 4 launches, you can totally spend the many days it will take you to play all of the past games. But you don’t have to. Borderlands 4 is set on a new planet, featuring new characters, and is a more self-contained story than the last few games. Sure, super fans will pick up on clues to the larger universe and past titles, but don’t feel like you need to play everything before starting up Borderlands 4.Â  Should I watch the movie?Â  lol. Don’t do that. Come on now. Be kind to yourself.
