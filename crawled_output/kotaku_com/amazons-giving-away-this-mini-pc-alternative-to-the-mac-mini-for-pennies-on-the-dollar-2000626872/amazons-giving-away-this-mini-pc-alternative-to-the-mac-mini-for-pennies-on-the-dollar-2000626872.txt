Tired of waiting for a new Mac Mini drop so you can grab a heavy-duty sale on the current model? You might want to consider making the big switch to Windows, because the mini PCs on that side of the street are super-fast, super-tiny, and exceptionally well priced. In fact, Amazon’s deal on the GMKtec M2 Pro mini is so good we had to check it for a typo â it’s just $410 after a big $230 price cut.
This is a loaded PC that will launch a thousand bad impressions of Yoda saying “judge me by my size, do you?” Just cut those off at the pass by acknowledging the amazingly compact body of the M2 Pro and then rattling off it’s many, many selling points: i7 Intel processor, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, Wi-Fi 6 and Windows 11 Pro pre-loaded. Judge it by its price while it’s this remarkably low.

Petite But Packed
The last time we saw something so tiny jammed with so many different items, it was a clown car at the circus, but the GMKtec M2 Pro is no laughing matter. That Intel Core i7 processor can push up to 5.0GHz, which is more than ample for keeping several browser tabs open, editing, streaming, and even some online gaming. There’s 32GB of RAM to back up all that action, and you can double that to 64GB on your own if you like. Same with the 1TB SSD â it’s plenty big, but you can double that to 2TB fairly easily and inexpensively.
There’s also an Iris Xe graphics chip in the M2 Pro, and with all that processing power and memory, your one small mini PC can run up to three displays at 4K res through the two HDMI 4K ports and one 4K USB Type-C port. That’s in addition to four USB-A 3.2 ports and a 2.5GB RJ45 LAN port, more than enough to keep all of your peripherals happy.
Hide It Anywhere
When you’re working with a desktop PC that’s only 4.5 by 4.2 inches square and 1.5 inches thick, you can place it pretty much anywhere on your desk without needing any large- or even small-scale rearranging. But one of our favorite features of these mini PCs is they come with a VESA mount that allows you to mount it on the back of a monitor. A little bit of cable management, and the M2 Pro is running the show sight unseen.
In addition to not being a desk hog, the GMKtec M2 Pro mini PC is easy on your electric bill, since it consumes only 35W of power. But best of all, while this Amazon deal is in place, it also only consumes $410 of your dollars, and puts $230 back in your pocket.
