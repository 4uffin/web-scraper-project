Boom! Bang! Kablam! Etc. and so on. There will be a lot of that happening today as a big new event on Steam has a whole host of fantastic retro-inspired first-person shooters on sale for the rest of the week. On September 23, Boomstock 2025 started on Steam. The event celebrates “all boomer shooters and retro-inspired” FPS games and features a ton of new trailers, demos, and of course, a load of games on sale. This includes some genuine bangers, like Dusk, Mullet Madjack, Project Warlock, Selaco, and Sulfur.Â  But don’t wait too long, as the event wraps up on September 27, which is just a few days away. If you need help picking out a new shooter to buy, here are some of the best and biggest deals we spotted from the event:
Nightmare Reaper – $15 ($25) Brutal John 2 – $9 ($13) Selaco – $19 ($25) Forgive Me Father – $10 ($20) Forgive Me Father 2 – $15 ($25) Wizordum – $15 ($20) Dusk – $7 ($20) Sulfur – $16 ($22) Zero Protocol – $7 ($12) Project Warlock 1+2 – $12 ($27) Mullet Madjack – $15 ($20) Warhammer 40K Boltgun – $11 ($22) Blood West – $9 ($25) Heavy Bullets – $2 ($10) Viscerafest – $10 ($20) Supplice – $15 ($22) Wild Bastards – $9 ($35) Shadow Warrior (2013) – $3 ($30) Shadow Warrior 2 – $3 ($30) HROT – $10 ($20) Gravelord – $15 ($20) Quatermain and the Cult of Cthulu – $2.50 ($3) Hard Reset – $1.50 ($15) Hard Reset Redux – $2 ($20) Serious Sam 2 – $2.50 Mycopunk – $11 ($14) Graven – $5 ($23)
I’d also like to shout out some demos for upcoming games that you can play for free right now. You totally should check out these games if you love classic shooters. Or Tetris. You’ll see what I mean. Anyway, here are some Boomstock demos worth playing:
Sportal – A boomer shooter all about using sports equipment like bats and tennis rackets. Blocks for Babies – Tetris meets Doom. It mixes 2D and 3D gameplay. It’s an odd one, but worth checking out. Slyders – This one is part Serious Sam and part roguelike, which is already a great pitch, but then you add in a cool cartoon fox protagonist, and you’ve got something special. The Last Exterminator – This is the Duke Nukem 3D sequel we deserved. This isn’t a new demo; I covered it last year, but it’s a part of the event and still worth checking out.
