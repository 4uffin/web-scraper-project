I have too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, there are enough cables circling around by night stand that it’s beginning to look like some sort of cyberpunk bird’s nest. Of course, this is my own fault. I can just get a charging stand such as this MagSafe one from Anker which will eliminate my electronic clutter entirely. It’s normally set at $111, but thanks to a 46% limited time discount, it’s now down to just $60. You save a whole $52 for the duration of the sale.

Designed for Apple
This Anker MagSafe charging stand is built from the ground up for modern Apple products. Newer iPhones, AirPod cases, and Apple Watches all support wireless charging and this stand has three wireless chargers built in. Each are specifically made for either phone charging, watch charging, or earbud case charging.
Be sure to check which model iPhone and AirPods you have as earlier versions don’t support wireless charging. So long as you have an iPhone 12 or later model, you’ll be good to go on that front.
Charging is fast enough for what the stand is going for. It’s capable of 15W charging. You can find much faster charging options when going with something wired, even within the Anker family of products. However, this is really an end-of-the-day sort of charging stand. When you turn down for the night, and set up all your devices on it, they’ll be fully charged by morning, no problem. That said, it can still bring an Apple Watch Series 9 to nearly 50% in just 30 minutes.
While you have your iPhone charging on the stand, it can be set to display the charging status of the other devices you have charging as well as a clock display. Perfect for your night stand to catch the time at a glance, head still on your pillow.
Anker’s has a safety-first design philosophy on its products and we have the same story here on the MagSafe multi-device wireless charger. ActiveShield tech monitors temperatures over three million times per day to help ensure your phone and other devices don’t overheat.
There are two color options available. Choose either black or white. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. Get it now for $51 off for a limited time. That brings the price down from $111 to just $60. You can get the black for $71 at the moment.
