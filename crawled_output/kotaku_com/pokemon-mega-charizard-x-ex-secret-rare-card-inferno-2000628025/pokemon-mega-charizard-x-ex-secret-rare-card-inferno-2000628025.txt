Across nine generations of PokÃ©mon, the roster of critters to catch and train has changed in each game. But even when the original fire-breathing not-dragon isnât a major player, Charizard remains one of the most coveted monsters in the trading card game. The fire/flying-typeâs original cards are valued at thousands of dollars, and every time it gets a new card, collectors and, unfortunately, scalpers scramble to track it down. As we approach PokÃ©mon Legends: Z-A, thereâs been a resurgence in interest in Mega Evolutions, including Charizardâs more powerful dragon-type form. That means itâs getting new cards in the upcoming Japanese Inferno X set (called Phantasmal Flames in the U.S.), and one of them is probably about to become one of the most sought-after cards on store shelves.

The Mega Charizard X ex is one of the Secret Rare cards in the set, and it first leaked in English last month, but now the Inferno X set is coming out in Japan on Friday, September 26. As such, some people have already gotten their hands on packs and started cracking them open, confirming the Mega Charizard X ex card that was floating around in those August leaks is, in fact, very real. Its illustration features Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, and Mega Charizard X floating or flying in the air, and itâs pretty fucking gorgeous. Collectors are already frothing at the mouth and worried about how difficult it will be to find on store shelves. Phantasmal Flames is coming stateside on November 14, and that means scalpers and Japanese collectors will have had almost two months to gauge the demand for each card before the English ones officially launch.Â  The secret illustration is one of five different variants of the Mega Charizard X ex card, but even if all the variants function the same mechanically in the TCG, this cardâs art and rarity are what will likely make it skyrocket in value on the secondhand market. Arceus be with you, collectors. I know some scalpersâ mouths are watering looking at this bad boy.
