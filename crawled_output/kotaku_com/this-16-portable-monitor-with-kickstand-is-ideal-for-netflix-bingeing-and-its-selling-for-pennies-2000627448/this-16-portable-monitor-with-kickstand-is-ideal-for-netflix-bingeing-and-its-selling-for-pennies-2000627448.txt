Portable monitors are a game changer when you need some extra screen space but canât lug around a bulky setup. Picture this: a screen thatâs just a bit wider and heavier than a regular notebook in your backpack, giving you plenty of room to work or unwind wherever you are. This Arzopa 16.1″ portable monitor fits right into that sweet spot. And the best part? Amazon is running an early Prime Day deal that slashes the price to about $76 after a 30% coupon, down from around $110.

Bigger Screen and Brighter Colors
This Arzopa design has also bumped up the screen size from 15.6 inches (which is typical for so many portable monitors) to 16.1 inches. That extra inch of screen space makes more of a difference than you might think: it gives you a more natural 16:9 ratio that is easier on the eyes and perfect for streaming your favorite shows.
Quality is not just a matter of size. The monitor uses an IPS panel with crisp 1080p full HD resolution. It also gains color accuracy with a comprehensive 100% sRGB gamut that renders images with rich, real-life colors. Thanks to a 1000:1 contrast ratio, dark areas are deep and detailed and the light areas glow, a wonderful option for anything from creative work to Netflix bingeing.
At 1.7 pounds and 0.35 inches thin, this monitor is easily stashed away in bags. Its slivers of a bezel pack more screen into smaller space, and the fold-out kickstand so you don’t require any other hardware to prop it up.
Both USB-C and mini HDMI connections let you plug it into laptops, phones, game systems, and more at a snap. There are a few display options like duplicate, extend, or as a second display, so you can configure your workflow or entertainment center without a single hassle. Plug and play is trouble-free as it plays right away out of the box.
If youâve been craving a little more screen real estate, this early Prime Day deal is a perfect chance to grab one of the most premium portable monitor without a hefty price tag.
