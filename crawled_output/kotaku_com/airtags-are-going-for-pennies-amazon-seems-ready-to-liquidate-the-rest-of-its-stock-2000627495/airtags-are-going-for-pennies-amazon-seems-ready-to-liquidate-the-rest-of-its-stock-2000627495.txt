It's so much more than a simple Bluetooth tracker.

One of Apple’s most practical products is not a MacBook or an iPhone. It’s something much smaller that addresses a headache just about everyone experiences: losing things. Apple’s AirTag has become an international best-seller because it makes keeping track of your things so easy, whether that’s your keys, your suitcases while traveling or even your kid’s backpack at school.
Right now, Amazon has an all-time-low deal with a single AirTag dropping to just $21 (down from $29) and the 4-pack decreasing to $74 (normally $99).

AirTags Are the Everyday Fix You Didn’t Know You Needed
If you have ever spent mornings searching for your keys or nervously hoped your suitcase made it onto the right plane, AirTags can make your life a lot easier. The technology that goes into them is really cool for devices so tiny. All AirTags use Apple’s Find My network which taps into hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the globe. You’re not just using your phone by itself to locate your item, then – there’s an entire crowd-sourced network trying to help you locate it. And in everyday use, it functions with incredible accuracy.
It doesn’t get much simpler to set one up. Place the AirTag alongside your iPhone or iPad, tap once as prompted, and it’s set. Then you can attach it to whatever you need to track. Most begin with wallets, keys or bags, but you’ll find many creative uses. Parents have been known to attach one to a child’s school bag, travelers place one in checked luggage and some even attach them to expensive gear or bikes for extra security. Because the AirTag itself is just over an inch in diameter and weighs only 0.39 ounces, it never feels obtrusive or out of place.
An individual AirTag uses a standard CR2032 coin battery that will survive for about a year before you’ll want to replace it. That means you won’t need to stress about charging it constantly unlike so many other intelligent gadgets. The AirTag also has an IP67 water and dust resistance rating so it will be okay if it’s caught in the rain or dropped in a puddle. For iPhone 11 and later users, Precision Finding uses ultra-wideband technology to give you on-screen arrows and even haptic feedback to guide you to your lost item, which offers you the exact direction and distance to it.
Amazon’s discount makes them even more appealing. One AirTag available for $21 lets you get your foot in the door for not a lot. But the best deal is the 4-pack for $74, which comes out to just over $18 per tag. Considering how many items in your life that could use a bit of an extra safety net, more than one is easily worth it.
