Why the Logitech G305 Lightspeed Is a Game-Changer
Computer mice come in all shapes and sizes but the G305 stands out in a few distinct ways. First, it only weighs 99 grams because of a slimmed-down mechanical design that glides smoothly. This makes it fast and accurate movements in game play without gaining weight in the hand which is important for high-stakes rounds when milliseconds count.
The real game-changer, however, is Lightspeed wireless technology by Logitech: Most wireless mice cause delays but the G305 boasts a blazing-fast 1ms report rate. What this translates to is your actions appearing on screen in a split second and deliver a level of responsiveness found in professional-grade far beyond casual gaming. And it’s fully wireless with a compact size and USB receiver storage integrated in.
At the heart of the mouse is the HERO 12K sensor that is a next-generation optical sensor known for incredible precision and efficiency. It delivers up to 12,000 DPI sensitivity for pinpoint accuracy whether youâre sniping across the map or quickly switching targets. Impressively, this sensor provides 10 times more power efficiency than typical gaming mice sensors.
The battery life for this mouse is also amazing: With a life of up to 250 hours of game play on a single AA battery, you can game long without concerning yourself with charging or sudden power loss. This level of staying power ensures that the mouse is always ready for marathon sessions or competitive gaming involving long periods of power performance.
Aside from specs, the G305 offers six programmable keysÂ where gamers have free will to tailor control and macros to a personal journey. Whether gaming FPS, RTS, or MMO, the buttons are flexible enough to structure gameplay for faster, smarter responses.
As stock runs low, make sure you don’t miss it.
