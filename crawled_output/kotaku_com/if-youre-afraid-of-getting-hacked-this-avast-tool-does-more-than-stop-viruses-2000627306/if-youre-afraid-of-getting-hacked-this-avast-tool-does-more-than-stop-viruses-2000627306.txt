Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life.
The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.

Protect Your Identity
With insight into the reality of rising threats, Avast has grown beyond mere status as the free antivirus pioneer to an all-out defender of PCs, Macs, Androids, and iOS devices through advanced protection that keeps up with the cybercrime tools of the modern age. Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.
A premium choice is Avast Premium Security. At a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78), it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.

Add more, and Avast Ultimate has it all from Premium Security with extras such as the Avast SecureLine VPN, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.
In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up, Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: they safeguard your entire digital existence and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.
