Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19. That’s basically $6 per charger, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.

Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up
If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. Itâs certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except youâre paying a fraction of the cost.
Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and you can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes. The included USB-C to USB-C cable ensures youâre set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and itâs Apple-certified for safety and reliability.
A USB-C and a USB-A port are both included in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.
Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.
At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.
