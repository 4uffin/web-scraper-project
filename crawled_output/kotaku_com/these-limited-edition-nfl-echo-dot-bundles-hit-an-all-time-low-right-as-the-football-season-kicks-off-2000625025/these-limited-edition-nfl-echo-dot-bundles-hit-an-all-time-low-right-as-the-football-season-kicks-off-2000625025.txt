The weather is cooling down. The leaves will be changing soon. And football season has officially begun. Any true fan it‚Äôs going to have some memorabilia of their favorite team. Most of them just sit there for display, but not this. Amazon‚Äôs Echo Dot now comes bundled with miniature NFL helmets. There are 32 different options, one for each NFL team in these limited-edition bundles. And then beyond that, you have your choice of color for the Echo dot itself, coming in either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue.
Amazon currently has a sale going on for the NFL Echo Dot bundle, but not for every team. Between each helmet and Echo Dot color, I‚Äôve taken on the tedious task of clicking on all 96 combinations to confirm which are on sale and which are still full price. After going through the full league, I can confirm only one set is on sale‚Äîthe Green Bay Packers. All three color options for the Wisconsin team are $25 off, bringing the price down to just $85. Cheeseheads get to live large this week. Sorry all other NFL fans in the country, but you‚Äôll be paying full price for your team‚Äôs limited-edition NFL Echo Dot bundle.

Vibrant Sound, Small Package
Why even get an Echo Dot in the first place? Well this smart speaker, despite it‚Äôs small stature, is capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass. It‚Äôs got a front-firing 1.73-inch speaker which pumps out room-filling audio.
Streaming from you Echo Dot, be it music, podcasts, or audiobooks, comes through with clear vocals. It uses lossless HD audio from a handful for streaming services, Amazon Music HD included. Beyond Amazon‚Äôs own stuff, the Echo Dot can play from Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM, and more. Control the volume or start and stop the track with simple voice commands.
Not just a speaker, the Echo Dot is first and foremost a smart home hub. You can control other smart products in your home by just asking Alexa. Use it to adjust settings on your TV. Change the lights from off to on or dim them without getting up from the couch. You can set cooking times, ask questions, create calendar events and so much more. You can even connect with family and friends who also have an Echo device or even just the Alexa app on their phone. Use multiple Echos to communicate between rooms of your house if you so please.
Come grab the NFL Echo Dot bundle (exclusively the Green Bay Packers edition) for the reduced price of $85.
