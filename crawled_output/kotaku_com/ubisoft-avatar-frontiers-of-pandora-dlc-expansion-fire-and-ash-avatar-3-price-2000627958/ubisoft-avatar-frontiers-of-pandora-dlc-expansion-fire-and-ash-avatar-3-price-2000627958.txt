Later this year, Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third entry in James Cameron’s blockbuster sci-fi saga, will arrive in theaters. And as that movie hits cinemas, a big new expansion related to the sci-fi sequel will launch for Ubisoft’s overlooked Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora.Â  2023’s Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a solid open-world game that plays a lot like Far Cry and features a gorgeous alien jungle to explore as a giant blue cat person, aka a Navi warrior. While the game didn’t set the world on fire at launch, it has developed a loyal following of players and received some post-launch DLC and updates. And now Ubisoft has announced a whole new expansion for the under-the-radar game that will connect it directly to the next Avatar film. The upcoming DLC, From the Ashes, is set to launch on December 19 for consoles and PC alongside the new movie, which arrives on the same day in theaters. It will cost $20 for people who own the main game already, and Ubisoft plans to sell a $40 version that bundles the game and the expansion together for new players.
Here’s the official trailer for the new expansion, as well as Ubisoft’s plot summary: “From the Ashes sees players embark on the journey of Soâlek, a battle-hardened Naâvi warrior from the Trrâong clan. Ambushed and left for dead by the RDA and their new alliesâthe ruthless Ash clanâSoâlek awakens to a world in flames and his Sarentu family scattered. Driven by grief and vengeance, he sets out to reunite with and protect his loved ones.”
“From the Ashes takes place a few weeks after the events of the upcoming film Fire and Ash and roughly six months after Frontiers of Pandora and both story packs,” the DLC’s creative director Omar Bouali explained to IGN. “From the Ashes is set in a ravaged and occupied version of the Kinglor Forest, which includes a new sub-region, The Ravines. It mirrors the themes of the film as it sees the RDA ally with the Ash Clan, fierce Naâvi warriors who thrive on chaos and pain as they intensify their efforts to eliminate threats to their regime. So, whilst the film and expansion are set in different regions of Pandora, there is some shared DNA and weâve worked closely with Lightstorm to ensure both pieces of Avatar media are complementary.” Shortly before the launch of the third movie and this new DLC, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora will receive a big, free update. As previously announced, this new update will arrive on December 5 and add new game+ and a third-person camera option. Then two weeks later, this new DLC arrives. For fans of Frontiers of Pandora, all 46 of you out there (myself included), this is some good news and a great way to end the year. Let’s just hope the DLC and new movie are good.
