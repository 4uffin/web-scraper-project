Video game files sizes have gotten ridiculous. As time goes on, they continue to balloon to astronomical levels that are frankly unreasonable. This is especially common among western AAA developers. Just this year, we sawÂ Oblivion: Remastered reach a size of over 120GB. I don’t even want to think about just how much spaceÂ Grand Theft Auto VI is going to take up. While these game files extending into the triple digits of gigabytes, our Xbox consoles still sit at their base internal storage of 1TB. If you intend to play more than just the same four games back and fourth, you’re going to have to do some regular maintenance of deleting and reinstalling games â but not one want to that. The better solution is to get yourself a dedicated expansion drive. Seagate has one made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For a limited time, you can grab it for a hefty discount.
See at Amazon
Right now, Amazon has three models of the Seagate expansion card for Xbox on sale. The 1TB model is down from $160 to just $130, saving you $30. The 2TB version comes down from $360 to just $218, a savings of $142. Then we have the massive 4TB model, normally priced at $500 but down to $430. That’s a savings of $70 with the deal. The best deal among the three at this time is for the 2TB version. That $142 savings accounts for a whopping 39% discount.
Since the Xbox Series X only starts with a single terabyte of storage, adding on one of these Seagate drives means you’ll be either doubling, tripling, or quintupling your storage capacity.
The Seagate expansion card is super easy to install. While the PS5 expansion SSDs require opening up the casing of your console, these ones for Xbox simply just plug into a dedicated slot in the back. No tools necessary. Once installed, you can choose to have the games you download save to either your internal storage or the new Seagate drive.
Play Games Seamlessly
Games saved to the Seagate drive receive the same benefits as those on your internal drive. One of the features of this generation Xbox that Microsoft likes to show off is Quick Resume. That allows you to suspend your game state of one game while you play another. You can hop from a race in Forza Horizon 5 into a quickÂ Rocket League match with your buds, then pop back over to Forza to cross the finish line.
Well, Seagate officially-licensed the Xbox Velocity Architecture which is what makes Quick Resume possible. That means its supported on any game you have downloaded, whether its to your internals or to your new Seagate drive.
