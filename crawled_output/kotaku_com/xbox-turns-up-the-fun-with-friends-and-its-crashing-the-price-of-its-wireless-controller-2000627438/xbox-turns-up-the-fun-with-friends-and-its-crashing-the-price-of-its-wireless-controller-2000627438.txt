Having a Xbox but not enough controllers kind of kills the fun, especially when playing with friends and family. What makes the console truly cool is those multiplayer moments, and nothing beats sharing the game with extra controllers on hand. The catch? Controllers arenât always the easiest or cheapest to grab. Thatâs why timing your buy is key, and right now thereâs a Black Friday-level deal on Amazon thatâs too good to miss: The latest Xbox wireless gaming controller is available for $53, down from its original $64.

Contemporary Design Coupled with Comforting Play and Intelligent Features
Its modernized design features sculpted surfaces and refined geometry that fit comfortably in your hands, and keeps you gaming longer without fatigue. The textured grip on the triggers, bumpers and back case is there to make sure your fingers stay steady and controlled. And the new hybrid D-pad adds precise directional control which is a big deal whether youâre navigating tricky menus or battling opponents.
The Share button is perhaps the best feature of them all since it lets you snap and share your gameplayâscreenshots, video, whateverâwithout breaking stride. It’s a simple way to share with friends or easily record your best victories.
The controller supports Xbox Wireless and Bluetooth which makes it simple to connect to many devices. If you’re playing on your Xbox console, alternating to playing with your Windows computer, launching games on Android or iOS, or even attaching it with Fire TV Sticks, smart TVs, or VR headsets, this controller lags behind none. With so much flexibility, you won’t need to keep multiple different controllers occupying valuable space.
And, to boot, players also have a lot of selection with sound: The 3.5mm headset jack will work with any supported headset, so you can simply plug in and talk or be completely enveloped in the game’s sound. The USB-C port lets you plug directly into your Xbox or PC for plug-and-play installation which is perfect if you are enthusiastic about a wired connection or charging during gaming.
All things considered, snagging this controller at $53 is a smart move whether youâre replacing an older one or expanding your multiplayer setup.
