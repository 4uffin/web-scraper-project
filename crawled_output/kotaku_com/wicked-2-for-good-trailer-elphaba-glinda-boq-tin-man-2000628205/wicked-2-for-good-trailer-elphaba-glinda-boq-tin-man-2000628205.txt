Maybe itâs just because nothing could possibly live up to the cultural takeover of last yearâs Wicked that the promotional campaign for Wicked: For Good, the second and final part of the Wizard of Oz stage musicalâs movie adaptation, has felt a bit understated. Weâre still two months away from the movieâs premiere in November, but this far out from the release of the first film, I was already being inundated with videos and memes of Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo on a press tour, and nothing like that has happened yet with this one.. So it was surprising to me to see that, this morning, Universal released the final trailer for For Good. Maybe Iâve just been in an unintentional media blackout, but what was more surprising to me than the arrival of the trailer itself was that it pretty much spoils some of the biggest twists in the musicalâs second act.
Wicked fans have spent much of the last year trying to obscure some of the major reveals yet to come after Erivoâs showstopping âDefying Gravityâ closed out the first movie, but the final trailer for the sequel pretty much gives away some of those details just months before the movie hits theaters. Specifically, the first film sows the seeds for iconic characters from the original Wizard of Oz to appear in For Good, but you might not catch on if you werenât already privy to the musicalâs second act. The most obvious is the lion cub Elphaba and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) rescue, who grows up to be the Cowardly Lion who accompanies Dorothy. But what about the Tin Man and Scarecrow who make up the rest of their crew? Well, viewers are quite familiar with both of these characters, actually. Boq, played by Ethan Slater, is turned into the Tin Man by Elphaba in an attempt to save his life. Fiyero suffers a similar fate, with Elphabaâs magic turning him into a scarecrow after he is tortured by the Wizardâs guards.
All of that had been mostly kept under wraps, until this new trailer. Boqâs fate is much more spelled out, as we see him turned into the Tin Man and shouting at Elphaba for what sheâs done. Fiyeroâs fate is more implied, as we see Elphaba stroking his face, but Bailey is facing away from the camera, so people who arenât paying a ton of attention might miss that one. If you somehow didnât catch it and are still reading this article anyway, sorry? Wicked: For Good heads to theaters on November 21, when we will finally get to hear Erivoâs rendition of âNo Good Deed,â resulting in world peace and happiness across the land.
