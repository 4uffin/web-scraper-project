Star Wars is the number one selling license of LEGO, even surpassing Harry Potter in fan enthusiasm. Most Star Wars LEGO sets have wonderful reviews, usually 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon and both children and adult fans enjoy them. One set that’s flying off the shelves, especially with its all-time lowest price just before Prime Day, is Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi shuttle: Now offered for $54, where it was once $79, it’s a bargain if you’re looking to revisit the galaxy far, far away adventures.

Step Into the World of Star Wars Adventure
This LEGO set mimics the streamlined and signature look of Ahsoka Tano’s starship in the well-known animated TV series. With 599 pieces, the set provides a satisfying build experience that’s perfect for kids 9 and up but suitable for adult collectors who desire a displayable model as well. The shuttle includes an opening cockpit that is well-suited to house the included LEGO mini-figures.
The collection includes four detailed mini-figures: Ahsoka herself, with two lightsabers; Sabine Wren, with two blasters; Professor Huyang, with a wrench; and Marrok, with a double-bladed lightsaber.
Functionality gets its proper place in this model with two stud shooters and storage bays that can hide tools, weapons and accessories and add realism and interactive play. The landing gear folds up neatly on the shuttle, automatically placing the wings in flight mode.
What makes this offer different from the typical Star Wars attraction is the combination of quality, level of detail, and now phenomenal pricing: Dropping to an all-time low of $54, the set gives children and collectors a chance to pick up a highly rated model at a friendly price at just the right time for holiday shopping or adding to a collection.
