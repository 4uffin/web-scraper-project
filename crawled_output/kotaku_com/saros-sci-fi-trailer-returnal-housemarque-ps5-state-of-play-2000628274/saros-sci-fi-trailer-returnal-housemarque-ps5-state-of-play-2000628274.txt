Sony opened its September State of Play with our first gameplay look at Saros, the next big PS5 game from Returnal makers Housemarque. It’s set to arrive on March 20, 2026 exclusively on PS5 and will be “enhanced” on PS5 Pro. Like Returnal, it’s a fast-paced third-person roguelike sci-fi shooter built around players dying over and over while getting stronger with permanent upgrades. Here’s the new Saros gameplay trailer that just premiered during State of Play. The upcoming sci-fi game stars Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj and looks just as wild and frenetic as Returnal.
And here’s the game’s official description: Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer, fights to survive on the lost colony of Carcosa under an ominous eclipse. Shape-shifting biomes and hostile ruins set the stage for a fast-paced, cinematic action experience where every encounter demands precision and adaptability. Combat unfolds as a fluid dance of dodges, shields, and parries, paired with a high-tech arsenal built of human and alien weaponry. Master enemy patterns, evolve your strategy, and face off against spectacular bosses that push every skill to the edge. Death is not the end, with permanent upgrades, evolving equipment, and the “Second Chance” system that allows you to always come back stronger. PlayStation 5 owners have been wondering what 2026’s exclusive release calendar will look like, and with Saros, it looks like Sony is starting the year off strong with what appears to be another exciting and likely tough-as-nails third-person roguelike shooter from a team that has been consistently knocking it out of the park for three decades. Will Saros match the success of Helldivers 2, the sci-fi shooter that kicked of Sony’s 2024? Probably not, but either way, I’m excited to get my hands on Saros in March of next year.
