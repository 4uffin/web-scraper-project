Dyson has been a leader for years regarding airflow control, first making its reputation with innovative vacuum cleaners, then with success for its innovative hair dryers. Its fan and air purifier product line more recently has also been a huge success. They’re good-looking enough to sit in any living room or bedroom, but their real strength is in their efficacy.
Now this Dyson Cool AM07 air multiplier bladeless tower fan has dropped to an all-time low price at Amazon, a deal better than what we have seen on Prime Day or Black Friday: It costs $249, having been reduced from $399, representing a 38 percent discount on a fan that pairs style with performance.

Innovative Airflow Technology That Packs a Punch
The Dyson Cool AM07 uses air multiplier technology to amplify ambient air for a steady and smooth stream of cooling air that doesn’t interrupt with blades chopping at the air. Not only is this bladeless design streamlined and safe but it creates airflow that’s natural-sounding and uninterrupted which is perfect for cooling a room pleasantly without shocking gusts. With 10 precise airflow levels, you are able to adjust the fan power to your needs.
This model also has silky smooth oscillation across a 70-degree range so that the airflow can move about a room without blowing down on a single spot. That’s something that makes it perfect for bedrooms or living rooms where you’re looking for a more even heat distribution. The rounded shape of the fan and magnetized remote are pleasing touches that keep your home tidy and uncluttered: no rummaging about under sofas or behind tables for misplaced remotes.
You can also use the sleep timer to automatically turn off the fan anywhere from 15 minutes up to 9 hours, so you can set it and forget it without wasting power on running the fan unnecessarily. This is what makes it a great companion on warm nights when you want cooling with the pleasure of not running the fan all night long.
Apart from looks and air flow, Dyson fans are designed to be silent so you will not be woken up by humming or rattling sounds. That makes the Cool AM07 ideal for home offices, nurseries, and where quiet is important. The iron and blue color scheme complements most decors and adds a touch of subtlety without dominating the space.
At $249, the Dyson Cool AM07 tower fan is a rare deal that wonât last long.
