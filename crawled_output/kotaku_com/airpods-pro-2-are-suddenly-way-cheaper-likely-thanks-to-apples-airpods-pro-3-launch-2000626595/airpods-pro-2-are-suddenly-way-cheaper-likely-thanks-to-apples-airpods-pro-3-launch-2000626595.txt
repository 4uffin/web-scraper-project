AirPods Pro 2 Are Suddenly Way Cheaper, Likely Thanks to Appleâs AirPods Pro 3 Launch
The newest AirPods release this weekend, but it's also a great opportunity to grab a hot deal on the proven quality of the Pro 2 buds.

Be thankful that even a mega-giant retailer like Amazon has a finite amount of shelf space. With the new AirPods Pro 3 dropping in mere hours, they have to make room for them, and they’re doing this bit of housecleaning by moving as many AirPods Pro 2 out the door as quickly as they can. There’s a 20% off deal happening right now at Amazon to help them make that happen, and while it’s extremely tempting to do the preorder for the Pro 3s, $199 for the proven-winner AirPods Pro 2 is a really stellar deal.
While we’re fairly certain the AirPods Pro 3 will be terrific â honestly, when’s the last time Apple released a total dud? â we 100% know how great the AirPods Pro 2 are, because we’ve been using the heck out of them since the updated version with the USB-C charging case dropped two years ago. There have been a lot of wireless earbuds released since that September 2023 debut, but we’re still convinced the AirPods Pro 2 are at the top of the heap.

Standard Setters
The overall sound quality, battery life, and comfort of the AirPods Pro 2 are all outstanding, but where these wireless earbuds really set the industry standard was with their Active Noise Cancelling superpower. Apple doubled the amount of background noise removing ability of the AirPod Pro 2 as compared to the previous model, and that standard is still at or near the very top of the category. The transparency mode lets you avoid being completely zoned out from external stimuli, and the adaptive audio is a mix of both modes, and probably the best of them.
The personalized spatial audio feature that optimizes the sound of the AirPods Pro 2 based on your own very unique ear structure, and the dynamic tracking that helps create an eerily accurate surround sound effect were also trendsetters in 2023 and remain so today. And if there are other wireless earbuds that also provide a medical-quality hearing test and actively protect your hearing as well as the AirPods Pro 2, we’d like to see them.

The King of Updates
With the AirPods Pro 2 came all sorts of amazing upgrades from any wireless earbuds Apple had put out previously. The 2023 refresh brought USB-C charging to replace the Lightning connection, with Qi wireless charging also an option. The H2 processor chip was a quantum leap in sound quality and depth of features for both music and phone calls. Improved comfort, controls, and battery life completed the package, which is why even now as their successor model is prepared to debut, the AirPods Pro 2 still sold over 10,000 units on Amazon in the past month, and will likely continue to do so.’
Call this a mutual-interest opportunity â Amazon needs to make room for the AirPods Pro 3, and you need a great deal on an established pair of world-class wireless earbuds. Give Amazon a hand and help yourself to the AirPods Pro 2 for just $199 while this deal lasts.
