Thereâs a lot to love about Sonic Racing: Crossworlds. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and Iâve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friendsâ latest run around the racetrack. Itâs got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing Sonic history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, youâre pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, theyâll exchange some words with whoever youâre playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the Sonic cast is a professional trash talker.

When I play Crossworlds, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so Iâve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, Iâm seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that thereâs some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. CrossworldsÂ  doesnât really have a story like previous Sonic racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, theyâre gonna try to rustle their opponentsâ feathers.Â  Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, theyâre usually pretty chill, and itâs sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they havenât really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges Iâve seen online thus far.

I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy. Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. #SonicRacingCrossWorlds pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu — The Sonic Stadium âª 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) September 18, 2025
I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent #IDWSonic issue. #SonicRacingCrossWorlds pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn — The Sonic Stadium âª 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) September 18, 2025
