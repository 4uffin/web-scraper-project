Do you guys think Donald Trump might have some kind of humiliation kink? Is someone with such a myopic view of the world, enabled by all the yes-men in his corner and the cult-like following of his supporters, even capable of perceiving embarrassment? Well, if the last 79 years of the businessman-and-reality-star-turned-U.S.-presidentâs life werenât embarrassing enough, his press conference yesterday, September 22, in which he tried to link autism to taking Tylenol during pregnancy, with zero scientific evidence or backing, would be enough to haunt the average self-aware person for the rest of their days. But for those of us who watched the president dribble out this absolute nonsense, it was a tremendous day to post.
If you want to watch the hour-long press conference in which Trump attributes a condition first recognized in 1912 to a pain medication that was introduced in 1955, itâs right here, but you will likely find the most interesting bits clipped on social media. Some highlights include Trump saying nonsense like âNothing bad can happen, it can only good happen,â and his being unable to pronounce acetaminophen. But to summarize, Trump and his merry band of misfits allege that if someone takes Tylenol while pregnant, their baby could pop out with the uncanny ability to remember the names of all 1000+ PokÃ©mon. He says that pregnant people should avoid Tylenol at all costs âunless medically necessary.â You know, âif you canât tough it out.â Notably, the conference constantly name-drops Tylenol, which is Kenvueâs brand name for over-the-counter acetaminophen, rather than more widely attributing this fake science to acetaminophen itself. So weâll see if Tylenol itself decides to pursue any sort of legal action. The entire thing was so nonsensical that the internet had a field day with the insinuation that Tylenol could be the cause of something that pre-dates it by several decades, and the jokes about having babies with special interests came aflowing.Â

if we take acetaminophen instead of a name brand while pregnant will the autism be generic or nah? iâm trying to have a savant — Sydney Battle (@SydneyBattle) September 22, 2025

My children are not on the autism spectrum because I took Tylenol while pregnant. Theyâre on the autism spectrum because I, a person who will wear only one type of shoe and canât eat food that is âtoo potato-y,â had babies with a man who has an encyclopedic knowledge of Europeanâ¦ — Emily Zanotti ð¦ (@emzanotti) September 22, 2025

It would all be so much funnier if it werenât also dystopian. Trump gave this speech alongside US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been spouting disproven anti-vaccine theories falsely linking autism to vaccinations. Just about everything these idiots say about science or healthcare can be and has been debunked, and yet they say it on the biggest stage with a captive audience. At least theyâre laughing at him.
