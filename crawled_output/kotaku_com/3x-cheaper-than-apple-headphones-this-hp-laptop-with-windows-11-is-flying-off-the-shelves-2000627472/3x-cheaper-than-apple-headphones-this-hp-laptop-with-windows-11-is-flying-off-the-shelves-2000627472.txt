With hundreds of laptops available today, it almost feels like thereâs one model for every person out there. But if youâre working with a tighter budget and donât want to settle for a Chromebook without Windows, thereâs a solid option to consider: This HP 14-inch laptop (64GB storage) is packing Windows 11 Home and ranks among the top 5 bestsellers on Amazonâand right now, itâs hitting its lowest price for a Windows laptop weâve seen at $171, down from $229.

A Budget Windows Laptop for Everyday Use
It has a razor-thin and light design along with a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel display of only 6.5mm and provides an immersive viewing experience with a 79% screen-to-body ratio. That is, you are nearly entirely viewing screen when you look at it which is ideal if you want a laptop that is up-to-date in terms of appearance without the clunky body. The 1366×768 screen resolution offers sharp images that will play nicely for streaming and the thin bezel renders the machine compact enough to carry around all day long.
Internally, the Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core processor strikes a balance between energy efficiency and power. It’s not meant for heavy users doing intensive tasks like video editing or all-day gaming sessions but it’s good enough for everyday use and does it while monitoring battery life to take you through the day. Intel UHD Graphics 600 offers streaming capabilities for 4K media and light games, so it satisfies light media needs with ease. The laptop’s 4GB of RAM enhances multitasking abilities and speeds up app switching, making it less frustrating during those hectic moments.
Storage is acceptable considering the price with a 64GB embedded multimedia flash card providing quick access to your files and software, though you might want additional external or cloud storage if you’re creating high-definition video or large sets of photography. Windows 11 Home edition comes pre-installed, which gives you the updated features and interface improvements, which make the device run quicker and easier to navigate than older releases of Windows or limited systems like Chromebooks.
If your laptop needs aren’t fancy but you want something that runs Windows just fine, this one’s worth a look.
