We all know that storage is a hot commodity. Whether it’s managing to have enough space on your phone to record new videos and photos or having enough room on your PC or gaming console to download an upcoming title, there never seems to be enough room. That’s why when stuff like SSDs, external storage, or MicroSDs go on sale, you pick them up. Right now, the Samsung EVO Select series of memory cards are on sale, going for as much as 26% off.
Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 128GB, normally $17, is several bucks off down to $13. The 256GB option is down from $26 to just $20. The 512GB MicroSD has been cut from $44 to $35 and the full 1TB option has dropped from $87 to just $75.

Give Your Switch Room to Breathe
For gamers, you can put this in your Nintendo Switch to manage both save data and the storage of the digital games themselves. The launch Nintendo Switch only comes with a measly 32GB. Now thankfully most Nintendo games aren’t too big by comparison to Xbox, PlayStation, and third-party AAA titles. Some of those shoot into the triple digits of gigs. One of Nintendo’s largest games,Â The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, is only 18.2GB. But still, that’s more than half your console’s storage.
Pop in the 1TB Samsung EVO Select for just $75 and you won’t ever have to worry about game storage on your Switch again.
Important to note: These MicroSD cards are not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires MicroSD Express cards which are faster at reading and writing data. Inserting one of the Samsung EVO Select MicroSD cards into a Nintendo Switch 2 console will not allow you to save or load neither your save data nor any digital games. It is still compatible with the original Nintendo Switch console along with the Nintendo Switch Lite and Nintendo Switch OLED.
The Samsung EVO Select MicroSDs have a read and write speed of up to 160MB/s. While not enough for the Switch 2, Nintendo only recommends speeds of up to 90 MB/s on its predecessor anyway so this will have no problem with the OG Nintendo Switch.
While the price is still down, you can at least quadruple your Nintendo Switch’s storage for as low as $13. That’s a hell of a deal. Make sure to downloadÂ Hollow Knight: Silksong once you’ve installed that sucker into your SD card slot.
