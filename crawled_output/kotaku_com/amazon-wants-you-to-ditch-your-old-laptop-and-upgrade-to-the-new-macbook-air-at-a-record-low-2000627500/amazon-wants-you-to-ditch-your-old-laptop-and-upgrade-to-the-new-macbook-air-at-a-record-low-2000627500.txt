Amazon Wants You to Ditch Your Old Laptop and Upgrade to the New MacBook Air at a Record Low

Apple’s latest MacBook Air (launched in March) has been among the company’s most popular laptops for some time now, but price has usually been the stumbling block. On Apple’s website, this MacBook Air with the M4 chip in its base configuration (16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage) starts at $999.
But today, Amazon has knocked everyone back by lowering the very same model to an all-time low price of $799. It includes the same warranty, the same box-fresh product and even more convenient delivery and return arrangements.

The Lightest MacBook Just Got Serious Power
The new M4 chip is at the heart of it and brings faster performance across the board. For everyday use, it makes juggling multiple apps smoother and faster. But it also goes into denser ground like photo and video editing or even graphics-intensive games. On top of that, Apple’s new Intelligence features which rely on the M4 to make writing assistance, automating operations and privacy-first AI capabilities possible.
While the performance boost is significant, design is still focused on portability: Winging in at over 2.7 pounds and under half an inch thick, this MacBook Air is meant to slide into a bag and almost disappear until you need it. Battery life is another bonus with up to 18 hours on one charge. That means you really can make it through a whole workday without having to plug in. It still has the same MagSafe charging port that’s so fashionable again, plus two Thunderbolt 4 ports, a headphone jack, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 support. For extreme users, you can even connect up to two external monitors.
The screen is also somewhere where the Air does better than you might guess at this price: The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen displays a billion colors and has amazing brightness and contrast. Text is razor-sharp for everyday use like reading and writing. But when streaming TV shows or looking at photos, the color accuracy is actually superb.
Apple has also put major work into the camera and audio system, changes that are more vital than ever with so much of life happening on video calls. The 12MP camera with Center Stage keeps you centered and properly focused and the three-microphone array ensures voices sound loud and clear. Four built-in speakers handle audio with support for Spatial Audio, and thus music or conference calls can sound surprisingly immersive.
What should seal the deal for many is the value angle. At $999, the MacBook Air M4 is already positioned as Appleâs most balanced machine between performance and portability. But at $799 on Amazon, youâre essentially getting premium performance, build quality, and the ecosystem advantages of macOS at a price that undercuts many Windows ultrabooks with weaker specs. Throw in Amazon’s delivery speed and return policy, and it’s difficult to argue full price up front from Apple’s website at this point.
The MacBook Air has long had the reputation of being the Mac for everyday use. With the M4 chip now inside and a historic price cut dropping it under $800, the 2025 MacBook Air feels like a golden moment for upgrading.
