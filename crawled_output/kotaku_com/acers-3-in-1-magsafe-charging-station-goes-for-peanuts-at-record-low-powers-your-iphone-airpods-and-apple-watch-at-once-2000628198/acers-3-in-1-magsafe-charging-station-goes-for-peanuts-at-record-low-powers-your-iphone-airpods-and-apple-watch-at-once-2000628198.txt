How many cables do you have running across your desk right now? The more smart devices we have the more clutter we accumulate as each needs its own cable and adapter to keep it’s battery charged up. My nightstand is a nightmare. Having to plug in my phone, earbuds, and smartwatch at the end of the day leaves barely any room for eave a glass of water. And when I reach to check a notification on my phone, the cables get tangled, pulling stuff off the stand. At least that was the case before I got myself a dedicated charging station. Take a look at this 3-in-1 wireless charger from Acer. It’s normally selling for $70, but Amazon has it in a limited time deal, bringing the price down by 32%. That equates to a savings of $22 having you only need to pay $48.

The Acer MagSafe charging station is designed with Apple in mind, making use of Qi2 wireless charging. Modern Apple devices all are equipped with wireless charging capability. If you have an iPhone 12 or later, your phone will be compatible. The 3-in-1 charger’s three dedicated charging platforms are each made for you iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, magnetically adhering to your devices. This keeps clutter down and you’re devices still easily accessible while charging. No more knocking things off the nightstand when you get a late night text.
The cylindrical base is made for stability, keeping it always upright even when you phone is providing some extra weight on top while charging. The anti-slip pads along the bottom keep it firmly planted in place. The charger also doubles as a stand. If you choose to keep the Acer charger on your desktop, you phone when mounted is set at an ideal viewing angle so you can scroll with it in place or just keep it there next to you in view in case a notification pops up.
Portability in Mind
The charging stand is made to be portable. The iPhone charging platform can rotate around to for a cylinder while the AirPod and Apple Watch platforms can retract into the base. This leaves you with a little capsule about the size and shape of a soda can which you can easily fit into your bag while traveling.
Get the Acer 3-in-1 charger and eliminated clutter on your desk for a hefty discount for a limited time. Right now, you’ll save 32% while the sale is still active.
