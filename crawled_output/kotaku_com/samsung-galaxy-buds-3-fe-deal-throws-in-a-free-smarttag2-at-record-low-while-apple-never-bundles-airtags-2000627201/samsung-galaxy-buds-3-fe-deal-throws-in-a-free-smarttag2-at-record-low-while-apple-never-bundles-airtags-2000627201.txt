The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.
Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robustâallowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.
