The Find My app makes keeping track of all your able stuff real simple. I’ve relied on it the time I left my iPhone behind at a restaurant, when I left a MacBook under the table at a coffee shop, and even when my Apple Watch fell into a river That one I never found, but hey, at least I knew it was in the river (I should really be taking better care of my things). The Find My app’s usefulness is undeniable, even if you’re just using it to track friends when at an event together or when traveling to a new city. Gee wiz, wouldn’t it be great if you could use that awesome feature on more than just an iPhone and other Apple stuff?
AirTags, people. That’s what you need. Amazon’s got a pretty stellar deal happening right now on a four-pack right now. Normally going for $99, or about $25 each, the online retail giant has them for just $75. The 24% discount shave’s $24 off the price, making them each average out to a a bit under $19.

Keep Track of Everything
These quarter-sized discs can be attached or placed inside of any amount of your belongings to make tracking them just as easy as it is for your iPhone. You can place on on a keychain so you don’t ever misplace your keys again. Stick one inside your wallet to that stops going missing around the house. Through one in a case with your Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. The big brain move is for when you travel. Place one in each of your checked bags. I’ve had my luggage go missing before and just having one of these could have save days of headaches.
Setting up the Apple AirTags couldn’t be any easier. With just one tap, they will be paired with your iPhone or iPad. Once connected, they will each populate in the Find My app next to any Apple devices you may have. You can then give them individual names so you know what exactly you’re tracking. Name the one you put in your purse, “Purse.” Name the one on your keys, “Keys.” Name theâoh, you get.
Let’s say you know your keys or wallet or whatever the AirTag is in is somewhere in the house. You’re just not sure where exactly. In the Find My app, you can initiate the AirTag to play a sound. They each have a built-in speaker so you can easily locate your belongings among your clutter or through various rooms of your home.
