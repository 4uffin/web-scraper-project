Crunchyroll will bring a bunch of the biggest manga series to the anime streaming service on October 9 with the launch of Crunchyroll Manga. While there are other manga reader services out there, the fact that lots of people already have a Crunchyroll sub and that Crunchyroll Manga brings many different publishers under a single roof has the potential to make it one of the most convenient options out there for keeping up with One Piece and other big series. The company announced on Thursday that Crunchyroll Manga will be available to all subscribers on iOS and Android, and will launch with works from AlphaPolis, COMPASS, Square Enix, VIZ Media, and Yen Press, followed by additional partners like Shueisha and J-Novel Club later on. There will also be a web version launching on October 15. Here’s the pricing breakdown:
Crunchyroll Fan + Manga â $11.99 USD / $15.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $4.00 USD / $5.50 CAD) Crunchyroll Mega Fan + MangaÂ â $15.49 USD / $17.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $3.50 USD / $5.00 CAD)
And here are some of the big-name series fans will have access to:
One Piece Jujutsu Kaisen Daemons of the Shadow Realm My Dress-Up Darling The Summer Hikaru Died Lycoris Recoil Delicious in Dungeon Sasaki and Miyano Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy Maiden of the Dragon: Falling for the Demon’s Lies
The service will be ad-free and come at no extra cost to people who already have the $16-a-month Crunchyroll Ultimate Fan subscription. Perks for all subscriber tiers include “the ability to download chapters for offline viewing, light and dark mode settings, and the ability to build a personalized reading list with curated recommendations.” Crunchyroll has only become more dominant since it was acquired by Sony and absorbed rival service Funimation back in 2020. It’s been riding the recent hit success of Demon Slayer in particular to new heights. Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Part 1 broke records this year, leaving fans waiting for news on Part 2 and 3. “Well, weâve announced that it will be a trilogy of movies, but our partners at Aniplex and Ufotable havenât decided on dates yet,” Crunchyroll boss Rahul Purini said in an interview this week. “But look, thereâs definitely urgency for all of us to bring more Demon Slayer to fans as soon as we canâbecause we know the urgency is there among the fan base.”
