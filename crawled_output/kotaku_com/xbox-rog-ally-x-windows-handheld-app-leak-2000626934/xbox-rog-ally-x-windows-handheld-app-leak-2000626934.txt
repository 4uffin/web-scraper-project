The Biggest Reason To Buy The Xbox Ally Handheld Just Leaked

Windows may prove a perfectly suitable platform for gaming on a traditional PC, but on handheld devices like the ROG Ally, Legion Go, or even the Steam Deck, itâs another story. Microsoftâs operating system is often too clunky and frustrating when youâre restricted to a gamepad for input. The upcoming Xbox-branded Ally from Asus, however, has promised a solution with a dedicated, controller-friendly user interface for running PC games on the go. These devices have yet to hit shelves, but a downloadable preview of a new version of Windows 11 is giving folks access to the new interface on just about any Windows handheld device. Read More: Steam Ate Microsoftâs Lunch On PC, Itâs About To Do The Same On Handhelds As noted by The Verge, The upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 lets you launch the new gaming-focused, fullscreen Xbox app for Windows with just a few tweaks to the registry and the help of a third-party tool (a Reddit post by user Gogsi123 outlines the whole process). Unlike the overlay that software companies like Asus provide for their Windows handhelds, this new Xbox app skips the entire Windows desktop environment in favor of a fullscreen, controller-friendly experience. And people are finding, by way of the preview workaround, that it seems to lead to marginal performance gains as well.
Read More: The Xbox Ally PC Gaming Handheld Feels Great, But At What Price? While this version of the fullscreen Xbox app requires some legwork to get working, its availability across Windows handhelds undercuts one of the main appeals of the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally Xâwhich is distinctly different from Asusâ ROG Ally Xâwhich is expected to arrive on October 16, 2025.
The ROG Xbox Ally X is less than a month away, and weâre still not sure of pricing Though the best graphical experiences are still had on well-kitted PCs and cutting-edge consoles, we are in the midst of a handheld arms race kicked off by Valve three years ago when it launched the Steam Deck. Since then, other PC manufacturers have jumped in with Windows-based options. More recently, the power of the Switch 2 has made it something of a competitor in this space as well.
Itâs all the stranger, then, that weâre not actually sure exactly how much Microsoft and Asusâ collaboration is going to cost. According to a report from former IGN writer Destin Legarie, a local Best Buy indicated that a $549 version and an $899 one would be available when he called to ask about it. If this is accurate, that puts the lower-tier version of the Xbox Ally at the same price as the smaller-capacity Steam Deck OLED, and within competitive pricing range of the current ROG Ally and Ally X, which retail for about $649 and $899, respectively.
Having enjoyed my time with the ROG Ally X, I can definitely attest to the value of having more games available on a handheld thatâs running Windows instead of Valveâs Linux-based SteamOS, though I typically prefer the form factor and controller-focused interface of the Steam Deck. Now, if a few tweaks to the Windows registry can also give people that experience on a non-Xbox Ally X, I imagine itâll be harder to find a use case for the Xbox Ally for those who already own a handheld gaming device and arenât afraid to tinker with their machines.
