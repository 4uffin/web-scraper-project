LEGO is easily one of the most beloved sets of collectibles. Just about from kids to adults love them. They make for great toys, gifts, or collectors items. But really what it’s all about is the build. Loading up the latest episode of your favorite podcast or the next chapter of an audiobook your working through while you sit at a table on down on the carpet, putting pieces together one by one.

Build Nostalgia
This LEGO Millennium Falcon is built to be display (but I won’t tell any one if you pretend to fly it around your bedroom while making the noises). When displayed, it sits at a dynamic angle like it’s taking a tight turn. The model measures in at just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and then seven and a half inches deep. It’s a great fit for any moderately-sized shelf.
The 921-piece set of the renowned Corellian freighter starship first seen piloted by smuggler Han Solo and his loyal companion Chewbacca has every part of the ship inside and out in great detail. Well, decent detail. To keep everything to size, the characters are all depicted with just two or three small round pieced stacked on top of each other. LEGO even decided to represent that weird holographic chess game Han and Chewie play in George Lucas’ original trilogy.
LEGO and Star Wars collaborated on this set in honor of the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars. Back in 1999, as a way to promote the new prequel trilogy’s first filmÂ Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, LEGO released its first Star Wars sets. Among them were an X-Wing fighter, a Landspeeder, and even minifigures of Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi.
And now here we are a little over 25 years later, LEGO and Star Wars are just has over thousand sets together â but we’re only here to talk about one set. Get this LEGO Millennium Falcon for 20% off for a limited time.
