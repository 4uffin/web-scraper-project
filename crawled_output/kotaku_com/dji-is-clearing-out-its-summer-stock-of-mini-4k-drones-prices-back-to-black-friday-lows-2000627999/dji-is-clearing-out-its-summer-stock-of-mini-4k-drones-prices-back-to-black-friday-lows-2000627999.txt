Choosing the right drone can feel like a real challenge with so many options out there. But if youâre just starting out or flying for fun, thereâs one key thing to keep in mind: your drone should weigh under 250 grams to avoid the hassle of FAA registration and Remote ID requirements.
That narrows your choices quite a bit, and luckily, DJI offers two solid options in that category. The ultimate bang for your buck is the Mini 4K â and right now, it’s available on sale at an all-time low of $249, down from $299, at Amazon.

The Ultimate Drone with Impressive Power and Precision
The DJI Mini 4K is not just light but it’s also designed to impress. Its small body is lightweight but it’s what it does in the air that truly counts: Loaded with a 4K Ultra HD camera and combined with a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system, it records video with silky, movie-quality smoothness. Whether capturing a sunrise, sunset, or nighttime scene, the sharpness and clarity are excellent. This means you don’t necessarily need to be an expert to create professional-grade videos.
Due to its brushless motors, the Mini 4K supports wind resistance as high as 38 kilometers per hour â that’s Level 5 wind resistance. It also comes with the ability to take off and fly at altitudes as high as 4,000 meters. This guarantees that your flying experience is still stable and sensitive even if the weather gets a bit challenging.
The increased battery life adds an important plus to your flight duration: You can purchase sets that include one battery for 31 minutes (like that one on sale at Amazon), two batteries total of 62 minutes, or even three batteries where you can fly for up to 93 minutes.
Casual flyers and beginners will appreciate its simplicity and safety features: With one-tap takeoff and landing, GPS-enabled “Return to Home” and automatic hovering, even those new to drones can quickly get comfortable behind the controls. Plus, the DJI Fly app offers in-app tutorials to speed up the learning process so youâll be flying and capturing your best shots in no time. The Mini 4K also comes with intelligent QuickShots like Helix, Dronie, Rocket, Circle, and Boomerang that make tricky flying maneuvers a breeze and capture stunning shots with only a few taps.
If you want to try aerial photography, this drone is the ideal friend.
