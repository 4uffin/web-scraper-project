Samsung Drops Its New Galaxy Z Flip7 FE by Hundreds With No Trade-In Needed, Likely to Rival the iPhone 17 Launch

Far be it from us to encourage a sibling rivalry, but when a new Amazon deal drops featuring an unlocked model of Samsung’s brand-new Galaxy Flip7 FE folding smartphone for just $700, and you notice that new price is a whopping $400 less than the Galaxy Flip7, it’s time for a little side-by-side comparison. It’s a limited-time 22% off deal on an unlocked 128GB version of the Flip7 FE, which was released just over a month ago, available in black or white. There’s no trade-in stipulation attached to this deal, although you can score a bigger discount with a trade.
For reference, the “FE” designation stands for “Fan Edition,” which Samsung uses on its models which have changes and upgrades based on user feedback. The question is, does the Flip7 FE lag behind its big-brother Flip7 so much that you should skip this deal and drop the extra $400 for the Flip7? There are definitely differences in size, and the Flip7 has some performance advantages you’ll want to make note of. But, $400 worth of difference? Let’s run through them.

Slight Screen Shrinkage
The 6.7-inch main screen of the Galaxy Z Flip7 FE is a bit smaller than the Flip7’s 6.9-inch main screen, and the difference is greater in the cover screens â 3.4 inches for the Flip7 FE, 4.1 for the Flip7. The battery of the Flip7 has an edge as well â 4300Ah vs 4000Ah for the Flip7 FE, although 4000Ah still falls under the “all-day battery” heading. The Flip7’s 12GB of RAM is greater than the FE’s 8GB, and the Flip7 is offered in 256GB and 512GB sizes compared to 128GB and 256GB for the FE.
Beyond that? Well, they’re awfully similar. The Galaxy Z Flip7 FE’s 10MP front camera, 50MP wide camera, and 12MP ultrawide camera are equal to those on the Flip7, as is the 10x digital zoom. Both smartphones are capable of super-fast charging, and the rest of Samsung’s formidable features â Galaxy AI, Google Gemini, the latest health-tracking metrics, the new “Now Brief” that shows up on the cover screen â are all identical.
The Verdict?
Well, it’s up to you to decide if slightly bigger screens, a little more battery, and a couple of other differences are worth $400. The FE is also a tad smaller overall, which might appeal to you if you keep your phone in your pocket and not in a bag. They’re both high-end Samsung smartphones with the additional bonus of combining 2025 tech with old-school flip-phone cool.
Amazon’s 22% off deal that drops the price of an unlocked 128GB Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 FE from $900 to just $700 is a limited-time proposition, and it’s not tied to a trade-in bonus. (Although you can trade in a qualifying device to knock down the price further.) Like we said, that sale price is $400 less than the Galaxy Z Fold7. What you do with that information is up to you.
