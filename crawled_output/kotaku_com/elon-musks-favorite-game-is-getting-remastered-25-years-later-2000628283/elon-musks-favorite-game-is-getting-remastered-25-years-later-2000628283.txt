Classic sci-fi immersive sim Deus Ex is returning with a fresh coat of paint and updated features, compliments of Aspyr. The remaster about a futuristic society crumbling beneath the weight of feckless governments and wild conspiracy theories arrives at a hell of a time. “Question Everything. Trust No One,” reads the tagline to a game with many fans, including billionaire Elon Musk. He called the original “one of the best games ever” in 2020. This new remaster promises visual upgrades and quality-of-life improvements similar to Aspyr’s existing HD remasters of the Tomb Raider games. Hopefully,Â  Deus Ex Remastered will be the definitive way to replay one of the most important games of the century. At least it will make the PC version accessible on console. The PS2 version, Deus Ex: The Conspiracy, joined PS Plus earlier this year.
The irony of Elon Musk’s love for the game has haunted it in recent years. One of the game’s original writers, Austin Grossman, called it the immersive sim’s “worst legacy” in an interview earlier this month.
âThat kind of political weight and social satire is a real common thread betweenÂ Deus ExÂ andÂ Dishonored,â Grossman, who co-wrote the Warren Spector-directed hit with Sheldon Pacotti and Chris Todd, recently toldÂ PC Gamer. âIt is the thing that Elon Musk likes, creepily. It is creepily in Elon Muskâs worldview. So that may be its longest, worst legacy.â Musk has been a lifelong gamer with a notorious career as an amateur Quake player back in college. Last year, however, he was caught cheating at games like Diablo 4 and Path of Exiles 2 by allegedly paying other people to boost his accounts. Trust no one, indeed.
