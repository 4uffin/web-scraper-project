This new Amazon deal might crank your kids’ holiday excitement all the way up to 11, or even higher if they’re Harry Potter fans. For a limited time you can get the LEGO Harry Potter 2025 Advent Calendar for just $38 after a 16% price cut. It’s like a regular Advent calendar, with 24 doors to be opened in the days leading up to Christmas, but instead of chocolate or candy there’s a buildable LEGO Harry Potter minifigure, magical creature, or mini build behind each door.
This adorable and fun calendar is perfect for boys and girls 7 and up, and the 24 easy-to-build minifigures have a total of 278 pieces. The figures include Harry Potter, Cho Chang, Draco Malfoy, Hannah Abbott, Angelina Johnson, Luna Lovegood, Blaise Zabini, and Cedric Diggory, all wearing Hogwarts holiday sweaters and carrying wand elements.

New Toy Every Day
The LEGO Harry Potter 2025 Advent Calendar has a door for every day from Dec. 1 to Christmas Eve, and unveiling and building that day’s surprise figure will be your kid’s favorite part of the day. Each buildable figure has illustrated instructions printed on the inside of its door, and don’t forget the LEGO Builder app that lets parents help kids access enhanced 3D views of each figure and other building tools.
In addition to the 8 wizarding minifigures, there are 6 magical creatures â Hedwig, Buckbeak with posable wings, Aragog with posable legs, a Thestral with posable wings, a Mandrake, and a Stag Patronus. There are also 10 mini builds â a Hogwarts acceptance letter, chocolate frog, Bertie Bott’s Every-Flavour Beans, butterbeer, the Sorting Hat, 3 potions, the Monster Book of Monsters, and 2 Galleons. Put it all together and by the time the big day rolls around, your boy or girl has 24 buildable, playable Harry Potter figures to enjoy.
Year After Year
One of the best parts about the LEGO Harry Potter 2025 Advent Calendar is, unlike those paper versions that contain chocolate or other sweet treats, this one can be used year after year. Just disassemble the figures, place them back in their individual doors, and put the calendar away until next year. Opening the doors, building the figures, and playing with them will be just as fun next time around.
It might be hard to think about the 2025 holiday season when we’re only a day into Autumn, but it’s coming sooner than you think, so deals like this limited-time one at Amazon offering the 2025 LEGO Harry Potter Advent Calendar for just $38 are a smart buy so you can have it on hand in plenty of time when December 1 rolls around.
