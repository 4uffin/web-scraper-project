We still have a few other holidays to get through before the big ones at the end of the year, but you can get excited for them now with this LEGO Star Wars advent calendar. Truly, I can’t thing of a better brand to be making advent calendars for the holidays. Small, surprise LEGO builds are the perfect little toy and activity to be greeted with each day while counting down to Christmas. This Star Wars one is normally priced at $45, but for a limited time you can scoop it up for 16% off. That brings the price down to just $38, saving you a cool $7.
This LEGO Star Wars advent calendar is new for 2025 and will transform December into 24 days of fun for any Star Wars fan six years old and up. The set includes a very specific choice of iconic characters across the franchise. You won’t find Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or Prince Leia here. You won’t even find Rey, Finn, the Mandalorian, or Grogu. Instead you get Babu Frik and a bunch of droids. C-3PO is there of course but you also get droids like R7-A7, BD-72, a scrap battle droid, and a super battle droid. BB-8 is adorably dressed up like a snowman and there is a Jawa that comes with a holiday sweater.

There are even more droids that buildable like a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, Buzz Droid, holiday versions of a Medical Droid and a Mouse Droid, B2EMO, Treadwell Droid, and a Probe Droid. Merry Droidmas everybody.
You also get elements of Babu Frik’s workshop which can be connected together by the time they’re all opened.
Let Star Wars Make Your Holiday Special
Maybe sometime along the way of this 24-day countdown with you new LEGO advent calendar, you make some time to checkout the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special of which most involved wish it to go away. The CBS made-for-television broadcast is set after A New Hope but before the yet-to-be-releasedÂ Empire Strikes Back. It follows everyone’s favorite Wookie Chewbacca alongside Han Solo venturing to return to Chewie’s home planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate “Life Day.” After its first airing it had never been broadcast again nor re-released in any official capacity. It’s not good and is the right choice to make this LEGO advent calendar have nothing to do with it.
Order your LEGO Star Wars advent calendar today for the reduced price of just $38.
