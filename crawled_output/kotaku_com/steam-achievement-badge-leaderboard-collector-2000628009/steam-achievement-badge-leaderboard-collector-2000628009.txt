Valve / Kotaku
Valve awarded Steam user SonixLegend a special achievement on Tuesday. It’s called the “Game Collector” badge, and it was bestowed upon SonixLegend after they purchased over 40,000 Steam games. As far as we know, they’re the only person to have ever done it. Cool! But also how? As Gamesradar reports, SonixLegend has a reputation in the Steam community for being the super-user even among super-users. Based in Shanghai, China according to their public records, they’ve been active on Valve’s PC gaming storefront for over a decade and have an account level of 303. They’ve been collecting games for years and it’s finally caught up with them in the form of a new Steam record. Thanks to places like SteamDB, we can glean all sorts of weird info about SonixLegend’s collection. Technically, they have 97,000 titles in their account, but majority of them are junk that don’t qualify for the achievement. If you were somehow able to magically refund everything in the library at today’s prices, the total catalog would be worth over $640,000. Man, would it suck to lose the password to that account or get banned for breaking Valve’s TOS.
Valve / SteamDB / Kotaku Polygon estimated that it would take over seven years to beat every game in SonixLegend’s collection. But at the rate they’re actually going, that will probably never happen. SonixLegend’s actual favorite game, ironically enough, is a free-to-play co-op shooter called Alien Swarm. It came out back in 2010. They have played it for over 550 hours. They also have over 100 Steam products that cost more than $200 each. But while SonixLegend is currently winning Steam, they’re hardly the only person gunning for the 40K achievement. A leaderboard shows nearly 20 other Steam users who all have over 30,000 games in their libraries. SonixLegend appears to be in a semi-direct race with at least one in particular who goes byÂ Ian Brandon Anderson. They’re the current runner-up with 39,497 qualifying games. Just, uh, another 533 to take first place. The current value of their library is $542,444. But being the first to 45,000, assuming Valve adds an achievement for that? Priceless. The money for Gabe Newell’s next yacht has to come from somewhere.
