Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in a grim attack on free speech. Out in less than nine months, The Mandalorian and GroguÂ now has its first trailer, and the next Star Wars movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.
The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.
Here’s a brief look:
And here’s the official synopsis: The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his young apprentice Grogu. The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging Star Wars lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of Star Wars naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing. The Mandalorian and Grogu is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming Star Wars movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a company currently facing a boycott from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy. Update 9/22/2025 10:35 a.m. ET: added more story details.
