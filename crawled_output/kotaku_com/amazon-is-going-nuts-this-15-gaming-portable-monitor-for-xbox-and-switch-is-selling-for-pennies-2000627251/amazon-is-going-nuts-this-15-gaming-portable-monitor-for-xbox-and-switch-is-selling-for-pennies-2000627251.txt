Update: The Forhelp portable monitor is no longer available. But weâve found a great alternative – a higher-rated and better-performing 15.6-inch 1080P model, now just $69 (down from $99).

Screens can quickly become a source of frustration. Attempting to work on a small laptop screen is claustrophobic, gaming on the Nintendo Switch isn’t the most immersive gaming experience, and even gaming consoles such as PlayStation or Xbox sometimes leave you wishing for a more delineated or flexible screen setup.
That’s where a portable monitor changes the story. The Forhelp 15.6âinch portable monitor provides a crisp 1080p display and a thin profile that you can take wherever you go, putting an end to all those screen frustrations at once. Even better, Amazon has cut it down to just $69 (from $79), which happens to be its all-time low.

A Portable Screen That Travels With You
What we love about this monitor is how much it manages to pack into such a compact body: Measuring only 0.3 inches thin and weighing slightly over 1.5 pounds, it slides perfectly into a backpack alongside your laptop or console. The aluminum alloy body adds strength and premium feel and the included magnetic smart case also doubles as a durable stand. You can stand it on a desk, an airplane tray table or a hotel nightstand with ease, and you still have some choice of viewing angles thanks to the grooves molded into the cover.
The screen is a Full HD 1920Ã1080 IPS display with a matte finish, so you have rich and true color, a wide 178âdegree viewing angle and less reflection. It even minimizes blue light emissions and eliminates flicker to make long sessions that much more comfortable on the eyes. Image quality is sufficient for this price to immerse you in movies and games and let you forget that compromised feeling when you’re not on your main display.
The monitor features two fully functional USBâC ports and a mini HDMI port so you can connect it directly to a laptop, Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch with a single cable. Thunderbolt 3/4 and USBâC DisplayPort Alt Modeâenabled devices will also power the monitor without the need for adapters so you’re ready to go in no time when working on the go. It’s designed for work and play and includes a number of modes to match how you’re utilizing it. You can mirror your laptop screen during a meeting, extend your desktop for real productivity gains, or use second screen mode on the move.
Two builtâin speakers add audio on the fly without needing external accessories. They wonât rival a dedicated speaker setup but they handle gaming sessions or movies smoothly enough to make this monitor truly selfâcontained.
What makes this deal hard to ignore is how much youâre getting at this price. Most travel monitors with a decent IPS panel, multiple connections, and a sleek aluminum case are more expensive, typically $100 or more. Here, for $69, you have a travelâfriendly second screen that can do double duty for productivity work and gaming rigs. Make sure you don’t miss this opportunity.
Update: The Forhelp portable monitor is no longer available. But weâve found a great alternative – a higher-rated and better-performing 15.6-inch 1080P model, now just $69 (down from $99).
