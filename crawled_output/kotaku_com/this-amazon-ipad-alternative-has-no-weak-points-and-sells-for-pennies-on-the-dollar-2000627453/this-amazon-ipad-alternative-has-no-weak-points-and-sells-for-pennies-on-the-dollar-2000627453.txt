Not everybody can afford $500 or $1,000 for an iPad or iPad Pro, but if seeking a decent everyday use alternative, Amazon’s Fire HD tablets are certainly well worth a look. They cover all the bases for general use and currently, Amazon is discounting the price by nearly 40% so the Fire HD 10 is pretty much impossible to ignore: At a price that has dropped to $89 from $140, it’s a chance to enjoy a quality tablet without the usual premium.

A Tablet that Gets Big Features at a Budget Price
The Fire HD 10 has prioritized speed and simplicity with 25% more performance than its previous generation through an octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. It means streaming, reading, browsing and gaming all happen without frustrating lags or delays. Its 10.1-inch full HD screen is rich with clean 1080p images and brings colors and details in sharp brightness. Whether binge-watching your favorite Netflix shows or flying through work, the screen makes every frame count.
Battery life is a smart friend in this case as it lasts up to 13 hours of normal usage. Yes, extended trips or days without a plug will not leave you stranded. Storing-wise, there’s 32 GB as base (expandable with a microSD card up to 1 TB), a whole book collection of apps, videos, and books in your hands. The aluminosilicate reinforced glass toughens the screen and withstands drops better than most of the competition, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.
The 5 MP front-facing camera is a welcome added feature for day-to-day video chats or social media content creation without needing to use special gear. And when inspiration strikes, the Fire HD 10 supports the Made for Amazon Stylus pen which recognizes over 4,000 levels of pressure for flowing, natural writing or drawing (bit it is sold separately).
If spending a big amount of money on an Apple tablet is not feasible but frequent use of a tablet is, this Fire HD 10 deal is difficult to pass up.
