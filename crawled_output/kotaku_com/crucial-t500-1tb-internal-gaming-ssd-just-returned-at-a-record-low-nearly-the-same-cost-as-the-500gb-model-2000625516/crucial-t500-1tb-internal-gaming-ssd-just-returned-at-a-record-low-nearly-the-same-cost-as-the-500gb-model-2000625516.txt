Congratulations. You’ve decided to build yourself a deck-out gaming PC on your own. If it’s you’re first time, know you’re in for a cool and rewarding experience. Also know that the cost of all your parts can add up real quickly if you’re not careful. Between the motherboards, CPU, and graphics card, things can get pretty pricy. And then when you start considering all the accessories beyond the actually computer like a good monitor, keyboard and whatnot, you’ll be shocked by how high the bill can get. That’s why sales are your friend. Take this SSD for instance. The 1TB T500 is normally going for $144, but right now, you can score one for 38% off. You’ll save $55 as the price comes down all the way to just $89 for a limited time.
Meet all your gaming needs with this Gen4 gaming SSD from Crucial. It’s capable of super fast read and write speeds. We’re looking at read speeds of up to 7,300MB/s along with write speeds of up to 6,800MB/s. Play the latest releases without absurd load times. I hope you can figure out how to git gud on your own because those tool tips that appear on loading screens will be a thing of the past. When tested against other Gen4 SSDs, the Crucial T500 performed 16% faster.

The internal will easily install into a laptop, desktop, or workstation’s M.2 slot. It’s not just great for gamers looking to store their game files, but really anyone who does any kind of high-end computing. Maybe you work with massive databases, maybe you’re a photographer saving a bunch of high-res RAW images and 4K video. You get a full 1TB on this Crucial T500 which should be plenty to work with. When working in creator apps like anything in the Adobe suite, you can get up to 42% faster performance when running heavy workloads or rendering photos or video.
PlayStation 5 Compatibility
If you aren’t building yourself a gaming PC or planning to use this on any PC for that matter, that means you likely intend to use it with your PlayStation 5. Just know up front that this SDD does not come with a heatsink. In case you’re unsure what that is, it’s just a tiny metal casing that goes around the drive. It allows heat to dissipate to prevent it from overheating. The good news if those aren’t very expensive, just about $7 to $15 on Amazon.
