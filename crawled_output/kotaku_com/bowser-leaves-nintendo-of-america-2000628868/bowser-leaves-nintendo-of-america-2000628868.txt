Doug Bowser is stepping down as President of Nintendo of America after five years in charge of the North American business unit. The 10-year veteran of the Mario maker departs shortly after the arrival of the Switch 2 with his retirement taking effect December 31. He’ll be replaced by long-time Nintendo executive Devon Pritchard, who will have the distinction of being the first female president in Nintendo of America’s history. âOne of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,â Bowser said in a press release. âSince that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences weâve created for consumers. Now, itâs time for the next generation of leadership and Devonâs track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the companyâs growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.â
Devon Pritchard will become the new Nintendo of America President. The first woman to hold this role. In even more shocking news, Satoru Shibata will be joining Nintendo of America as CEO. — Stealth40k (@stealth40k.bsky.social) 2025-09-25T21:29:03.273Z
Satoru Shibata, who at various times in the past was head of Nintendo Australia and Nintendo Europe, will be joining Nintendo of America as chief executive officer, while maintaining his role as managing executive officer at Nintendo Co. in Japan. Pritchard will be elevated to the Nintendo of America Board of Directors and join the executive officer group in Japan.
“With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendoâs legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family,” Pritchard said in a statement.
Bowser took over as President of Nintendo of America back in 2019 after Reggie Fils-Aime stepped down following 15 years in the position. Bowser took on a less visible role than his predecessor, but has still appeared in the occasional Nintendo Direct and at big launches, including the recent opening of a new Nintendo store in San Francisco. Bowser’s departure comes shortly after IGN reported a change to the customer service department at Nintendo of America, including more outsourcing to cut costs. âDuring his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo,” Nintendo head Shuntaro Furukawa said in a statement. “I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts.”
