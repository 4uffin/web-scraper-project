The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator Ready Or Not was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. On or around September 17, Ready Or Not’s community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted: “Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.” Screenshots and posts of this comment were quickly shared online by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.Â  And that’s exactly what Void did.
On Friday, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in Ready Or Not‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.Â  Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, was no longer listed as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server claimed that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.
Kotaku reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted. “To Our Ready or Not Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.Â  “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around Ready or Not.”
This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, a developer working on Ghost of Yotei was fired by Sony after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. The alleged killer’s connection to video games has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them referencing Helldivers 2. Meanwhile, ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday. Updated: 9/19/2025, 3:30 p.m. ET:Â When asked for further comment, Void Interactive PR pointed Kotaku to the studio’s previously mentioned statement, which has also been posted on Ready or Not‘s Steam page.
