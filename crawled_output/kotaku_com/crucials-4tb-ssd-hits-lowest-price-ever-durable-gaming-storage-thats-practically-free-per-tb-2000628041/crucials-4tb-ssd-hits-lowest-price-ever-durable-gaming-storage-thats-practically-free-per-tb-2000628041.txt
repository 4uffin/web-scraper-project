The Crucial X10 portable SSD is available in up to 8TB. A couple of them are listed as being one sale, but there sale prices are proportional to where the others not on sale are just set at by default. So to avoid any confusion, let’s just break down where each is selling for now.Â The 1TB model is set at an even $100. $165 will get you 2TB. For $240, you can get the 4TB model. The 6TB model is going for $320. Then we have the 8TB model for just $440. Essentially, you’ll only paying $55 per terabyte when you go with the largest capacity SSD available.
Whether you are a creator, student, or PC gamer, you’re going to need a massive amount of storage.

For gamers in particular, video game files sizes keep creeping up higher and higher with every new release. Some games like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered reach gigabyte counts upwards of the triple digits. Some modern PCs come with just a1TB of storage or even less. You have to constantly delete and redownload games if you want to play more than just a handful. Expanding to up to 8TB will eliminate this data storage maintenance nightmare for you.
Same goes for creators. If you’re working with video and photo editing, that raw footage and pictures can add up pretty fast on your internal drive. The Crucial external SSD will allow you to expand to a workable amount of storage, plus take it with you when you need it on the go. The Crucial drive is compact. It’s kind of crazy that you can fit a full 8,000GB in your pocket, but here we are. Plus, its IP65 dust and water resistant, keeping it safe from the elements. It’s been test to be able to handle drops of up to 9.8 feet.
All That Data on the Go
The Crucial X10 portable SSD is much faster than an HDD. It’s working with read and write speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s. You’ll have no issue editing big video files or loading up AAA games on your PC. And the external drive is widely compatible with other devices besides PC. In addition to Windows, you can also use it with Mac, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, Android, Linux, as well as PS4, PS5, and Xbox via USB-C and USB-A.
Right now, you can get the Crucial X10 portable SSD for as low as $100 for 1TB or splurge for the full 8TB option for just $440 for a limited time.
