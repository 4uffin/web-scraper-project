Saros, the next action game from Returnal developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterdayâs State of Play presentation. The game stars iZombie and The Fall of the House of Usher actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there. In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for LittleBigPlanet on Vita. So really, itâs all been leading up to this point.
A little something regarding Saros â¤ï¸ — Rahul Kohli (@rahulkohli13.bsky.social) 2025-09-25T16:24:24.291Z
I know itâs cliche to say âthis is a dream come trueâ but in the case of Saros, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.Â  One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in iZOMBiE was playing Fahz in Gears 5, I didnât think anything could top thatâ¦ until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in Saros.Â  Itâs been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isnât just a career highlight, itâs one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th. Thatâs sweet. I was a big fan of Kohliâs performance in The Fall of the House of Usher, so Iâm interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when Saros comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20.
