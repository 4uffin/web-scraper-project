It’s usually the previous-gen tech that gets the big online sale price, but sometimes the timing is perfect and the price tag on the latest and greatest model takes a sudden fall. That’s happening right now at Amazon with Sony’s WH-1000XM5 premium noise-canceling wireless headphones, which are just $298 right now. That’s over $100 off the regular price for these world-class noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones, but the deal is showing signs that it might not be hanging around for very long.
This one is well worth hurrying for, because the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are truly premium. Sony’s given the already formidable noise cancellation power of the 1000XM4 headphones an even bigger dose of tech, and the new Integrated Processor V1 delivers Sony’s best sound yet.

Best Sound, Longest Time
The optimized sound and noise cancellation of the WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones will be a revelation from the second you put them on, but if you feel like you need aÂ very long listening session to truly appreciate them, that’s totally within their range. The battery gives you up to 30 hours of listening time, and even a super-short 3-minute charging session gives you a 3-hour window to enjoy that sound.
You’ll want to take every second of that time to really immerse yourself in all of the tech upgrades that Sony’s packed into the WH-1000XM5 headphones. The elite noise cancellation is created by 8 microphones controlled by 2 processors, and the Auto NC Optimizer tech automatically optimizes the noise cancellation based on your environment. The WH-1000XM5s are also spectacular headphones for hands-free calling, with 4 beamforming mics for precise voice capture combined with that noise cancelling power.
More Than Music
As hard as it might be to turn off the music, the Sony WH-1000XM5s are great for far more than just music and hands-free callings. They also support Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands, and because they also can pair with two Bluetooth devices at the same time, you can take whatever you’re doing from the laptop or desktop to your smartphone without the hassle of pausing, unpairing, and re-pairing.
This Amazon deal on the Sony WH-1000XM5 premium noise-cancelling wireless headphones has a funny habit of coming and going at odd times. Hesitating now could mean waking up tomorrow and finding them back to their regular $400 price. (Still worth it, by the way.) But right now they’re 25% off, which translates into a total steal at just $298.
