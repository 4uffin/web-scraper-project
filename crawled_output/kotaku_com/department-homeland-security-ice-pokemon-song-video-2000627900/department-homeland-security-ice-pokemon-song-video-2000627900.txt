One of the many consequences of the incredibly dystopian descent into fascism America is experiencing right now is that these motherfuckers have access to the internet and think their heinous acts of terrorism are memeable capital-C Content. Someone particularly evil over at the Department of Homeland Security posted a pretty vile video showing ICE, cops, border patrol officers, and military agents arresting dozens of peopleâ¦and they set it to the original PokÃ©mon theme song from the â90s. The video was posted to the Department of Homeland Securityâs social media channels on September 22 and shows multiple arrests and searches, including clips of armed squads using explosives to get into closed buildings and groups of people being rounded up, all while either blurring or obscuring the faces of both the people being arrested and the officers themselves. If that wasnât weird enough, the footage includes interstitial cuts of PokÃ©mon protagonist Ash Ketchum throwing Poke Balls, with the âjokeâ being that heâs âcatchingâ these various criminals. To really lay it on thick, the video concludes with mock-ups of PokÃ©mon trading cards featuring several of the people arrested, which include mugshots, descriptions of their alleged crimes, a flag from their respective home countries in the background, and a description of where and when ICE arrested them. Oh, and theyâre all âweakâ to ice-type attacks.

A lot of these people are being accused of some pretty significant crimes, which is the kind of picking and choosing you do when youâre trying to obscure the fact that ICE has routinely picked up innocent people, including legal U.S. citizens. The memeification of propaganda is revolting, but people arenât falling for it. The comments on the video are full of people tagging The PokÃ©mon Company and Nintendo, both of which are known for their litigiousness in copyright disputes. Weâve reached out to The PokÃ©mon Company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.
