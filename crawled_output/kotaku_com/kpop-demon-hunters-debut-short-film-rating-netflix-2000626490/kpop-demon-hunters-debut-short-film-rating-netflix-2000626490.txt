We know KPop Demon Hunters, Netflixâs animated musical that has set the world on fire for the past few months, is likely getting a sequel after the movieâs runaway success. However, it seems like we might not have to wait too much longer to see Huntr/x, the filmâs demon-slaying K-pop group, again, as the Motion Picture Association has leaked that a short film follow-up has been rated. A document on the MPA film ratings website includes a listing for something called Debut: A KPop Demon Hunters Story, which is rated PG for “some action/violence and scary images.” Sony is listed as the distributor, and the listing says it is a “short subject,” which is a designation given to short films rather than the feature-length movies the ratings board usually handles. The fact that itâs already been rated means that its release is probably imminent, and the title suggests it could cover the early days of Huntr/xâs K-pop career. Maybe weâll get to see the girls meet for the first time, learn the truth about the demons preying upon humanity, and establish themselves as a dominant force in the K-pop world. If so, we might also get some new songs? All of this is speculation right now, but it was established back in 2023 that Sony would produce a short film based on KPop Demon Hunters through its LENS mentorship program, which was also responsible for The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story, a seven-minute-long short based on the Spider-Verse movies. Itâs unclear if Debut will be streaming on Netflix like the full movie or if it will be on publicly available channels like YouTube. If there is new music, Iâll have to update our ranking of the movieâs original songs, though it will take something really special to dethrone the song in the number one spot.
