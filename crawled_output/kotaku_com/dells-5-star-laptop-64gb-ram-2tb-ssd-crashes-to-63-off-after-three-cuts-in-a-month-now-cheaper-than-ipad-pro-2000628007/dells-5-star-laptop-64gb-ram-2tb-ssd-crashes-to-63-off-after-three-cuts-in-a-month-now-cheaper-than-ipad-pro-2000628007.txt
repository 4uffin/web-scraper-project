Dellâs 5-Star Laptop (64GB RAM, 2TB SSD) Crashes to 63% Off After Three Cuts in a Month, Now Cheaper Than iPad Pro

It’s almost as if Amazon knows you’re thinking about upgrading your older laptop for something newer, faster, and packed with more features than you thought possible. Why else would they offer this deal on the Dell 15 Inspiron touchscreen laptop in its most souped-up state â the max 64GB of RAM and 2 TB SSD, preloaded Windows 11 Pro, and a free accessory bundle worth $199? It lists for $2,400, but right now it’s just $900 dyring this killer 63% off limited-time deal.Â
Credit where credit is due, Amazon has been hard-selling this high-end Dell model lately, maybe because they know that a touchscreen laptop packed with as much RAM and SSD space as possible and driven by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor (speeds up to 4.5GHz) and AMD Radeon graphics chip is a literal game-changer to anyone who’s been slogging through their work and play with an older, slower machine. Why else would they take a do-it-all machine like this and slash $1,500 from the price?

Premium Machine, Premium Deal
The top-of-the-line specs, preloaded Windows 11 Pro â including the AI wizardry of Microsoft Copilot â and compact profile and light weight of this Dell laptop virtually guarantees it would be a significant upgrade for pretty much anyone. (Other than the happy shoppers who have already cashed in on this deal.) It’s slim and lightweight enough to pop into a backpack or briefcase to take anywhere, and built sturdily so it won’t break down or fall apart during your road trips.
The touchscreen has all the responsiveness of a high-end tablet, but it’s also a full-HD screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and IPS technology for wide viewing angles. The energy efficient LED-backlit screen helps keep your power bills manageable, and the entire screen plus processor plus graphics card is the equation for awesome streaming on the Dell Inspiron 15. But if you insist on using the high-end visuals for work, there’s also an HD webcam and MaxxAudio Pro speaker for those unavoidable Zoom calls.
No Upgrades Needed
You won’t need to immediately drop more money on upgrading the OS of this Dell Inspiron 15, because Windows 11 Pro is already loaded and ready to go. Which also means Copilot AI is at your service. This AI assistant has gotten rave reviews for power, speed, and intuitiveness, and the Dell Inspiron 15 gives it more than enough processing power to do that research or write that email for you almost instantaneously.
We’ve been playing Whak-a-Mole with these massive PC laptop deals at Amazon â every time we think we’ve covered the last of them, two more pop up. But there’s on guarantee these will continue to drop like this, and this one that saves you $1,500 off the price of a brand-new Dell Inspiron 15 touchscreen laptop and free accessories bundle valued at $200 isn’t going to get beat anytime soon. Head to Amazon now and make the upgrade that puts a powerful touchscreen PC laptop in your hands and a pile of money back in your pocket.
