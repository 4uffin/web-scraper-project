The way all athletes improve is with data. If you want to find success in your fitness, you need to be able to define what that looks like and then measure it. If you’re getting into running, hiking, swimming, or really any outdoor activity, a GPS watch can be the difference between staying on track or letting your progress fall by the wayside. Amazon has the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar on sale at the moment for 28% off. Normally going for $500, right now you can get the tactical edition of this GPS fitness watch for $139 off. That brings the price down to just $361 for a limited time.
Garmin’s Instinct 2X is a rugged, outdoors watch build to handle getting a little bit roughed up. It’s thermal, shock, and water resistant in its 50mm polymer case.

Use the Garmin Instinct 2X to track your health and fitness 24/7. You can stay on top of your body metric with wrist-based heart rate, advanced sleep monitoring, respiration tracking, Pulse Ox and more. For during your workout, gain insights in your run, bike ride, or swim such as your pace, distance, or VO2 max.
The watch has a built-in LED flashlight which can help when going on runs after dark. Really I just love to use my watch’s flashlight in place of my phone’s flashlight. Whether you’re walking downstairs for a drink of water or looking for something you dropped at night, it’s kind of nice to be able to illuminate the area with a bright light while keeping your hands free.
Built for Ironmans
With the Garmin Instinct 2X, you have the standard capability of recharging your watch over USB, but you may not ever end up needing it. This rugged GPS smartwatch has solar charging capability. While out on your run, the watch can recharge back up to full while in use. In fact, just three hours of solar charging daily will provide you with infinite battery. You can just leave that USB cable in a drawer somewhere.
Infinite solar charging opens up a lot of possibilities for the watch â particularly, longer races. Now I won’t ever touch an ironman, but maybe you’re built different. These triathlons consist of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike and a 26.1-mile run They might take a person the more than half a day to complete. A friend of mine does these, and quite literally runs with a portable power bank because their watch â even at full charge â can’t last the whole race. As you can see, that’s not an issue with the Garmin Instinct 2X and its solar charger.
