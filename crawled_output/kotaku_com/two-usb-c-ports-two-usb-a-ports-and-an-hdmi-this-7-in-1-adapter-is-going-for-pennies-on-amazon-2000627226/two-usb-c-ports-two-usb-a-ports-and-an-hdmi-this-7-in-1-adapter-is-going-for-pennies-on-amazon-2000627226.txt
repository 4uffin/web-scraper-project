Manufacturers of laptops have been working on making thinner and lighter laptops for years, and the byproduct of that is necessarily diminishing the amount of ports. You no longer need to deal with a string of ports for HDMI, SD cards, etc. That’s why carrying a USBâC hub is now essentially a requirement, especially if you own a MacBook or a thin Windows laptop. This Acer 7âinâ1 USBâC hub is the gap filler and now it costs a record low of $17 (down from $24) on Amazon.

A Little Hub That Widens Your Laptop’s World
What this hub basically does is give your laptop the versatility that’s been taken away from it by manufacturers: Plug it into one USBâC port and you’ve got seven handy connections at your fingertips. There are two fast USBâA 3.1 ports for keyboard and external drives and two further USBâC data ports capable of transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps. There’s even a full-size HDMI output to feed 4K video at 30Hz or Full HD at 1080p which makes it easy to plug in to monitors, projectors, or even your TV.
Through its Power Delivery port, this Acer hub can pass through up to 100W of power which is enough to keep a MacBook Pro charged while youâre running everything else at once. That means no worrying about draining your laptop midâpresentation or midâflight. If youâve ever been stuck unplugging accessories just to keep your laptop alive, this hub solves that daily frustration.
For photographers, content creators, or anyone who still uses SD cards in cameras and drones, the MicroSD and SD ports are a lifesaver. You do not need to carry extra adapters to transfer files directly into your laptop. The hub itself is housed in a rugged aluminum casing which protects it from damage and keeps it cool when used extensively.
It works with MacBooks, Windows laptops, ChromeOS, Linux, and even gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck. If your tablet supports Samsungâs DeX mode, it turns your portable device into a desktopâstyle setup with a display and peripherals connected through this hub. In practice, that means one tiny accessory can unlock a huge boost in productivity whether youâre working from home, commuting, or even gaming on the go.
And for just $17, this Acer 7âinâ1 hub is like one of those rare upgrades that are worth it the moment you connect it.
