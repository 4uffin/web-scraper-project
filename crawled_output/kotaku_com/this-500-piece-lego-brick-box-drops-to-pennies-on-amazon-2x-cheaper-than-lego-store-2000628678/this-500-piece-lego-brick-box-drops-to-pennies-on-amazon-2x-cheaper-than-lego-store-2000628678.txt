Itâs fun to dive into LEGO Star Wars or Harry Potter sets but once theyâre built, many people hesitate to actually play with them. They often feel more like display pieces than toys. Thatâs why every LEGO fan should have a brick box filled with hundreds of colorful pieces: Itâs the foundation for pure creativity, letting you build, rebuild, and invent completely new ideas without limits.
Right now, Amazon is offering the LEGO “medium” brick box at its lowest price ever: Instead of paying the usual $34, you can get it for just $17, which is two times cheaper than on the official LEGO site where itâs still full price. And if you want to go bigger, a larger 790âpiece brick box is also on sale at Amazon for just $39 instead of $59.

Endless Possibilities for Play and Imagination
What is so special about this brick box is that it gets at the very essence of LEGO: open-ended building. With 484 pieces in 35 colors for the medium size and 790 pieces for the large box, you’ve got everything you need to get your imagination going, from windows and toy eyes to tires with wheel rims, perfect for cars, trains, or whatever your imagination comes up with. Even the green baseplate, well over 3 by 6 inches in size, is included, giving young children (and let’s be honest here, adults as well) a firm base upon which to build.
And it’s not all about chucking bricks around willy-nilly. The variety of pieces in this box enables kids to craft small animals like the tiger figure that is provided, motor vehicles with movable wheels, or even small houses with window cutouts. This assortment has been designed by LEGO to be compatible with their other sets so you’re not locked into one theme. You can add these pieces to any LEGO world you currently have, opening up possibilities without limit. That’s a big reason why this set gets a 4.8 rating out of 5 from more than 53,000 customers repeatedly.
Once the playtime entertainment is over, the entire set goes into storage within the durable storage box. Instead of bricks everywhere on the living room floor or on the way, the box is a great storage system. That small feature makes it so much less trouble for adults but it also increases the chances for kids to put their creations away and transport the box with them wherever they go.
For kids, having a creative brick box at home encourages hours of screen-free creativity play. It’s the type of toy that can grow up with children and it’s just as fun for grown-ups who are wanting to sit down and build something stress-free.
Since youâre paying half the amount charged on LEGOâs own site, now is the time to grab them while these record-low deals last.
