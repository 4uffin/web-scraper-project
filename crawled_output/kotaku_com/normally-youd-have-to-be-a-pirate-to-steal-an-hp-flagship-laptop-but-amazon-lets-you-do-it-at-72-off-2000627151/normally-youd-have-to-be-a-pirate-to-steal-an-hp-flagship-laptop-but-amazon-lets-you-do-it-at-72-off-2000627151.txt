When you add the word “flagship” to a tech device, that comes with a lot of expectations. A company is planting their reputational flag on this product. This HP laptop is literally called the Flagship â a 15.6-inch touchscreen machine with a 6-core Intel i3 processor, 32GB of RAM, a fat 1TB SSD, and preloaded with Windows 11 Pro and Copilot. It’s at Amazon right now at the very un-flagship-like price of just $660 â a massive 72%-off limited-time deal that you will not want to miss.
We probably would shy away from this one if it was listed at its full price of $2,399, even with the free accessory bundle that includes an external CD/DVD drive, mouse, camera protector, dust plugs, and more. But when you knock 72% off that price, we’re all in for grabbing this high-end laptop and the free goodies for just $660.

The Full Rundown
There’s more than enough packed into the HP Flagship to warrant this deal. Start with the Intel Core i3-1315U 6-core processor. It’s not going to win the Indy 500 for speed against the truly elite PC processors, but it’s plenty fast enough for multitasking, browsing, video calls, and streaming. It definitely overperforms the i3 label, especially when it’s backed by 32GB of RAM to keep the whole works moving smoothly, and a 1TB SSD that won’t have you clicking that “you’re running out of storage” warning dialog box as you work.
The 15.6-inch touchscreen is a definite winner. It’s fast and reactive to give you the full tablet-like experience when you want it, and it also comes with anti-glare treatment and enough resolution (1366 x 768 HD) and Intel Graphics to be your go-to for streaming movies and TV shows. Pair that with the 720p HD camera (with protector/privacy shutter in the accessory bundle) and dual-array microphones and your video calls for work or leisure come through crystal clear.
The Real Deal
This isn’t a previous-gen laggard sneaking into the deal space â the HP Flagship is a 2025 model laptop armed with the very latest Windows bells and whistles, thanks to the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro OS. That of course comes with Copilot, the best AI assistant you’re probably not using nearly enough, along with enterprise-grade security, BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and advanced device management.
You can proudly fly the flag of the HP Flagship 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop whether you’re a student, a small-business pro needing an everyday productivity machine, or just someone who appreciates a very well-built and high-performing laptop. Everyone can agree that this Amazon deal is a monster â 72% off, dropping the price from $2,399 all the way down to just $660.
