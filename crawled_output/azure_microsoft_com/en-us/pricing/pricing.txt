FAQ
Azure pricing and billing FAQ

01/
Where can I find Azure product prices and get pricing estimates?
Azure product pricing is available on the Azure pricing page, in the Azure portal when you create a new resource, and through individual product pages. To estimate your costs, see the pricing calculator.
02/
What is Azure Hybrid Benefit?
Azure Hybrid Benefit is an Azure offer that allows you to maximize savings in your migration journey by giving a discount on server licenses or subscriptions and granting deployment rights. Customers can save up to 85% compared to standard rates when combined with Azure reservations and Extended Security Updates (ESUs).2 Azure Hybrid Benefit is applicable for customers with Windows Server and SQL Server licenses with software assurance or software subscription and customers with RHEL and SLES Linux subscriptions.
03/
What options do I have to save on my Azure compute usage?
There are many different ways you can save on your Azure compute usage ranging from Azure Hybrid Benefit to a one- or three-year Azure Reserved VM Instances or Azure savings plan. Depending on your workloads, you may need to use Azure Reserved VM Instances, Azure savings plan, or often combination of both. Read this blog article to learn how to decide which one to use for your workloads.
04/
How do I know which pricing option to choose for compute services?
You may benefit from different Azure pricing options and offers depending on where you are in your cloud journey. To learn how to select the pricing option that matches your needs and goals, read this blog article on how to choose the best Azure pricing option for your cloud journey.
05/
What payment options do I have for purchasing Azure?
Purchase Azure by using a credit card or opting to receive a monthly invoice. We don't accept prepaid or virtual credit cards. You are solely responsible for any credit card interest or other credit card charges. If you choose to pay by invoice (check or wire transfer), you can't switch to the credit card option. For more information, explore our purchasing options.
06/
In what currency are Azure priced?
Azure prices are in US dollars throughout the world, including Azure products and services, Azure support, and Azure reservations.
07/
How are non-Microsoft products and services priced?
All non-Microsoft products and services can be priced in US dollars or local currency.
08/
How is Azure priced under the Microsoft Customer Agreement?
Azure is priced in US dollars (USD) worldwide under the Microsoft Customer Agreement. If you transact in one of the other supported currencies, your monthly cost is first calculated in USD. For payment, the total is then converted to the local currency.
09/
Under the Microsoft Customer Agreement, in which currency will my payment be processed?
The list of countries and their billing currencies is available in the Microsoft Customer Agreement FAQ.
10/
What is an Azure plan?
As part of the new commerce experience, an Azure plan gives you access to Azure services at standard pay-as-you-go rates under your Microsoft Customer Agreement.
11/
What exchange rate will be used and how does it work with my bill?
We use London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate-setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month and will be applied to all Azure purchases and all Azure consumption in that month.
12/
Can I pay in local currency if my agreement was signed in Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Mexico, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, or South Africa?
If you are located in one of these regions, the usage associated with your signed Microsoft Customer Agreement(s) will have to be paid in US dollars. The local currency for each of these regions will no longer be supported by our payment system, learn more at Microsoft Customer Agreement FAQ. For pricing details on your existing subscriptions you can log in to your account, view the pricing calculator, and view your current pricing by selecting your existing agreement details.
13/
Where can I find additional information on pricing and billing?
Visit Microsoft Q&A for more information. If you're an Azure customer and you'd like information about your billing account, please contact us.
[1]
Customers may see savings estimated to be between 11 percent and 65 percent. The 65 percent savings is based on one M64dsv2 Azure VM for CentOS or Ubuntu Linux in the East US region running for 36 months at a pay-as-you-go rate of ~$4,868.37/month vs. a reduced rate for a 3-year savings plan of ~$1,703.44/month. Based on Azure pricing as of October 2022. Prices subject to change. Actual savings may vary based on location, instance type, or usage.
[2]
Savings based on sample of VMs across variety of regions including Dv4 in West Europe. Savings are calculated from full price (license included) for SQL Server Enterprise edition VM against reduced rate (applying Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server and Windows Server), which excludes Software Assurance costs for SQL Server and Windows Server. Actual savings may vary based on region, instance size, compute family, and EA agreement. Prices as of January 2023, subject to change.
