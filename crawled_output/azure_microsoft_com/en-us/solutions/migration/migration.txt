What are the benefits of cloud migration and modernization?
There are a lot of benefits with application and data modernization, but most organizations are motivated by one or both of the following: Spend more time innovating and less time maintaining legacy infrastructure by using cloud-native technologies.Build applications that are resilient, highly scalable, independently deployable, and able to evolve quickly by using microservices architecture.
Learn more about the benefits of cloud migration
What are the different phases of cloud migration (including database migration)?
All workload cloud migrations—including databases—typically follow a six-step process. Factors such as the types of workloads, the complexity of the existing digital estate, and industry or governmental compliance requirements might require special planning and tools, but the six steps are almost always the same: Define strategy: Define your business justification and expected outcomes.Plan: Align actionable adoption plans to business outcomes.Ready: Prepare your environment for your cloud migration strategy.Adopt: Move your workloads to the cloud environment.Govern: Benchmark and implement governance best practices for your environment and workloads.Manage: Use proven methodologies to manage your cloud and hybrid solutions.
How do I modernize applications and databases?
Modernize your .NET or Java apps by using Azure App Service or Azure Spring Cloud, and modernize your databases by using Azure managed databases like Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instances. Modernization enables you to take advantage of Azure platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities such as built-in security, patching, high availability, and autoscaling. You can also containerize your .NET and Java apps and run them in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) without needing to make any code changes.
How do I extend Azure to hybrid, multi-cloud, and edge environments?
Extend Azure management and services to hybrid, multicloud and edge environments using Azure Arc. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform, enabling you to manage your entire environment with a single pane of glass by projecting your existing resources into Azure Resource Manager. You can also manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they’re running in Azure.
