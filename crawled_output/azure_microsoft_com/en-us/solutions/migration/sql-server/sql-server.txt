01/
What is Azure SQL?
Azure SQL is a family of fully managed, secure, and intelligent SQL database services, built upon the same SQL Server engine. With Azure SQL, you can rehost SQL workloads on SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, modernize existing applications with Azure SQL Managed Instance, and support modern cloud applications with Azure SQL Database. You can manage your entire portfolio through a consistent and unified Azure portal experience.
02/
How can I determine which Azure SQL service will be best for my requirements?
There are three primary considerations for selecting the right Azure SQL service for your requirements: your overall objective, the extent to which you require operating system (OS) access or control, and the version of SQL Server you prefer. If you require control of the underlying OS due to compliance or software dependencies and prefer to remain on your current version of SQL Server, then rehosting to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines would be your best option. If, however, OS control is not a requirement and you prefer to be on the latest “versionless” SQL Server, then modernizing your existing applications or supporting modern cloud applications on fully managed solutions like Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance would be optimal.
03/
How do I begin my database migration?
First, use Azure Migrate to download and install Data Migration Assistant. This tool generates assessment reports that identify requirements before migration, and it recommends target migration SKUs in Azure. Then, use the Database Migration Service to migrate your database to your selected destination.
04/
What is Azure Accelerate?
Azure Accelerate is an offering that helps fuel your cloud transformation by providing expert guidance, investments, and resources.
05/
What is Azure Hybrid Benefit?
Azure Hybrid Benefit is an Azure offer that helps you maximize your Azure savings while accelerating your adoption to the cloud. You can apply this Azure discount to your Windows Server and SQL Server licenses with active Software Assurance, or RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions.
