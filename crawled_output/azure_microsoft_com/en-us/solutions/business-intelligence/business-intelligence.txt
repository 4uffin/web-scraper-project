Frequently asked questions about Microsoft BI solutions
What is business intelligence?
Business intelligence is the process of analysis of business information (strategies and tools) to make sense out of business data.
What is data visualization?
Data visualization brings data to life through live dashboards, interactive reports, charts, graphs, and other visual representations to help you find key business insights quickly and effectively.
What tools do I need to get started?
To start discovering insights from your data, you need two things: a business intelligence tool and a data source. After you connect your tool to your data source, you can begin creating data visualizations. These interactive visualizations help users understand what is really going on so they can make informed decisions.
Where can I see my dashboards?
Power BI is designed to work where decisions are made, so dashboards can be surfaced almost anywhere. Dashboards are available in the cloud, on-premises, and on mobile through native apps. Dashboards can also be added in collaboration tools like Teams and SharePoint, to websites, or to SaaS applications like Salesforce and Dynamics 365. The easy-to-understand dashboards can also be added to PowerPoint presentations.
