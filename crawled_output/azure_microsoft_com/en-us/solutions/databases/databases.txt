“Azure SQL Managed Instance was the only option that met all our requirements. We had 10 terabytes of data, a massive transaction load, and the need for geo-replication supporting an active-standby architecture. And we can’t be down for even a minute.”
Jayanta Saha, Principal Data Architect at American Airlines

“The important thing for us is that we have an open mind not just for technology, but for innovation. Every new solution is a way to find the best options, to learn the most about how we can improve our operations.”
Enrico Lapel, Data and Analytics manager at E.ON Italy
Read the story
“Azure Cosmos DB as a globally distributed, scalable database enables the system to retain the previous customer conversations and preferences, allowing it to keep learning and become tailored to the driver. Its low-latency response times can bring data and apps closer to the users.”
Ivan Diaz, Principal Staff Engineer for AI Services at TomTom

The study was commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by Principled Technologies in October 2023.
[2]
Price-performance claims based on data from a study commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by Principled Technologies in December 2023. The study compared performance and price performance between a 16 vCore and 32 vCore Azure SQL Database using premium-series hardware on the Hyperscale service tier and the db.r6i.4xlarge and db.r6i.8xlarge offerings for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL I/O-Optimized (“Amazon Aurora”). Benchmark data is taken from a Principled Technologies report which used the HammerDB TPROC-C benchmark. The TPROC-C workload is derived from the TPC-C Benchmark and results were obtained with the HammerDB TPROC-C workload. The HammerDB TPROC-C workload is derived from the TPC-C benchmark and is not comparable to published TPC-C Benchmark results, as this implementation does not comply with all requirements of the TPC Benchmark. Price-performance is calculated by Principled Technologies as the cost of running the cloud platform continuously divided by new orders per minute throughput, based upon the standard. Prices are based on publicly available US pricing in East US 1 for Azure SQL Database and US East for Amazon Aurora as of December 2023. Performance and price-performance results are based upon the configurations detailed in the Principled Technologies report. Actual results and prices may vary based on configuration and region.
