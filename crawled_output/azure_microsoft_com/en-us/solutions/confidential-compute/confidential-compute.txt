Overview
Protecting data privacy and security on your most sensitive workloads
Data privacy and secure multiparty data analytics
Increase data privacy and security surrounding business and consumer data by protecting data in use. Discover new opportunities with multiparty data analytics and machine learning that combine datasets to keep data private among participants. Take advantage of the broad range of confidential compute offerings Azure provides, including hardware, services, SDKs, and deployment tools.
Protect data in use
Help secure your sensitive and regulated data while it's being processed in the cloud. Azure confidential computing encrypts data in memory in hardware-based trusted execution environments and processes it only after the cloud environment is verified. This helps prevent data access by cloud providers, administrators, and users. Build on top of highly secure hardware using familiar tools, software, and cloud infrastructure, or migrate your existing workloads and applications.
Share AI insights confidentially
Combine datasets confidentially, without exposing your data to other contributing organizations. Benefit from confidential computing and valuable AI and machine learning insights. Upload encrypted data to a secure enclave in a virtual machine (VM) and perform algorithms on datasets from multiple sources.
Own your data
Migrate to the cloud and keep full control of your data in a trusted execution environment. Specify the hardware and software that have access to your data and code, and verifiably enforce this guarantee. You’ll retain control over your protected information to meet government regulations and compliance needs. Customize your confidential computing path using tools and solutions built in Azure, in open-source frameworks, and by independent software vendor partners.

01/
What is confidential computing?
Confidential computing protects data in use. Confidential computing encrypts data in memory and processes it only after the cloud environment is verified to be a trusted execution environment. This helps prevent data access by cloud operators, malicious admins, and privileged software.
02/
Why is confidential computing so important?
As datasets grow because of AI and cloud scalability, scrutiny on how data can be exposed is increasing—from both a consumer data privacy perspective and a compliance and regulation perspective. In parallel, the complexity of cyberthreats and ongoing attacks means organizations must proactively ensure that data is protected throughout its lifecycle.
03/
Which industries use confidential computing?
Confidential computing is expanding from regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services to the retail, manufacturing, and energy sectors. Every industry can benefit from confidential computing.
04/
What are some use cases for confidential computing?
Common use cases include reducing fraud and waste, anticorruption, antiterrorism, records and evidence management, intelligence analysis, global weapons systems and logistics management, vulnerable population protection (such as child exploitation and human trafficking), fighting money laundering, digital currencies, blockchain, transaction processing, customer analytics, proprietary analytics and algorithms, disease diagnostics, drug development, and contact tracing.
05/
What are the benefits of using Azure confidential computing on a blockchain network?
Blockchain technologies built on Azure confidential computing use hardware-based privacy to support data confidentiality and secure computations.
