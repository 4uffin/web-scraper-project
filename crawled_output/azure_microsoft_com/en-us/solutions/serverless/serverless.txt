OVERVIEW
Focus on code, not infrastructure
Increase developer velocity
Reduce the time spent on non-core business tasks by freeing developers from infrastructure provisioning and management. Build and deploy apps faster using developer-friendly APIs, low-code/no-code services, and ready-to-use AI models.
Develop event-driven architectures
Build highly responsive and resilient systems using serverless compute on Azure. React in real time, scale on demand, and innovate faster.
Scale with ease
Use fast, elastic scaling to meet any traffic needs on demand. Serverless compute on Azure adjusts easily to your business growth, whether you're handling a sudden traffic surge or planning for long-term expansion.
Services
Simplify your cloud journey
Choose from a range of serverless execution environments, fully managed services, and a comprehensive set of developer tools and services to build your applications.
