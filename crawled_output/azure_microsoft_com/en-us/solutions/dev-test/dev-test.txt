Optimize your development and test environments on Azure
Empower your team to quickly provision dev/test and pre-production environments to deliver quality products, applications, and services. Use purpose-built, managed developer services like Azure DevTest Labs, GitHub Codespaces, and Azure Virtual Desktop to easily manage and optimize dev/test environments, tenants, and subscriptions, without sacrificing governance, cost controls, or security.
Securely code from anywhere
Create dev/test environments in seconds
Minimize waste and maximize control
Stretch your budget with low dev/test rates
Prepare apps for real-world demands

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Use Azure Virtual Desktop to securely remote into development environments. If you don't need direct access to remote resources, use GitHub Codespaces to create cloud-hosted developer environments from any hosted Git repository. Connect to these environments directly from Visual Studio Code, which provides an experience that looks and feels local.
Application services
Use a rich set of managed developer services to provision fast and compliant dev/test environments that are tailored to your unique needs. Quickly provision and manage team-specific environments across your organization by using Azure DevTest Labs reusable custom templates to reproduce test environments. Simplify the management experience of Windows virtual machines (VMs) and deploy and scale your dev/test environments with ease using Azure Virtual Desktop.
Data services
Use Azure DevTest Labs to centrally manage your dev/test environments with full control of VMs, and custom template configurations to reproduce high fidelity environments. Set lab policies to automatically shut down and start up virtual machines, and use the lab cost trend feature to estimate your spending and set thresholds. Use Microsoft Cost Management for increased visibility into project costs, while utilizing quotas and policies to ensure that costs stay on target.
Machine learning
The Azure Dev/Test offer provides discounted rates for your ongoing development and testing, with no Microsoft software charges for Azure Virtual Machines and special dev/test pricing for other services. Save even more with reservations for one-year or three-year commitments on VMs and Azure SQL Database. Visual Studio subscribers also receive free monthly credits that can be used to explore and try Azure services.
" "
Create resilient applications built to manage the high-scale load of production environments and continue to run when faced with unexpected disruptions. Build load testing into your DevOps workflows using Azure App Testing to generate high-scale load and optimize app performance at scale. Maximize app resilience using Azure Chaos Studio to see how existing apps handle simple and complex failure scenarios.
