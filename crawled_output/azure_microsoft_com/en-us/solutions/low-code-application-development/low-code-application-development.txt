01/
How much does Power Apps cost?
You can start building apps for free with the Power Apps Developer plan. For individual or small team usage, limited Power Apps Basic is included in some Microsoft 365 licenses.

04/
How is data stored in Power Apps?
Power Apps uses Microsoft Dataverse to store and manage data, with built-in benefits from the comprehensive low-code security and governance features and policies in place from Microsoft. Learn more about security
05/
Does low code promote shadow IT and introduce security and governance problems?
No. Introducing low-code development into your organization can reduce shadow IT, since employees build solutions in-line with provided rules and governance. Learn more about low-code governance
06/
Is low-code development replacing professional developers?
Low-code development isn’t a replacement for developers—it gives developers an additional tool to build solutions. It enables developers to automate repetitive tasks, prioritize complicated jobs, and devote their time to more difficult projects. It also empowers more employees in an organization to support the development team by creating professional-grade websites and apps. Learn more about low-code vs. traditional development
