Cloud-native architecture
Cloud-native architecture enables you to act on new ideas more often, respond to changing needs faster, and run resilient and scalable applications more easily. By packaging application code and dependencies in containers and deploying them as microservices, you increase architectural portability to deploy applications across environments with little or no modification. Changes can be made to individual components with lower risk to the whole application.
Kubernetes helps you manage the containers at scale. Increase release velocity and operational scalability by using DevOps processes and tools to automate build, test, and delivery of the microservices.
Learn about cloud-native systems
AI-powered user interface and application logic
Infuse AI into both the user interface and business logic application layers to enhance user experiences and deepen business insights. Engage audiences globally by adding translation, chatbots, and voice for AI-enabled user interfaces. Enhance business logic with AI for scenarios like search, personalization, document processing, image analytics, anomaly detection, and speech analytics.
Modern application development enables developers of all skill levels to easily add AI capabilities to their apps with prebuilt and customizable AI models for speech, vision, language, and decision-making.
Learn about building intelligent apps with cognitive APIs
Integration using out-of-the-box connectors and API management
Modern integrations using out-of-the-box connectors and APIs help you to be more productive, access data easily, and keep your disparate systems up to date in real time. Connectors are ready-made integrations that make it easier to connect apps with software as a service, systems, and data anywhere—on-premises or in the cloud.
Lightweight APIs enable integration with protocols like REST and OAuth. They simplify data retrieval and sharing between services without having to use a heavier message bus. Tap into APIs that already exist in an enterprise and expose them securely through a gateway with hybrid capabilities to access APIs at the edge, on-premises, or in other clouds.
Learn about modern cloud-based integration
Fully managed databases
Deliver personalized, responsive digital experiences without handling complex database infrastructure and security management. Fully managed, cloud-based databases provide limitless scale, low-latency access to rich data, and advanced data protection—all built in, regardless of languages or frameworks. Choose the data models, APIs, storage structures, and deployment options that best fit your application patterns.
Elastic and always-on databases support business continuity and improve responsiveness to the changing environment. They help operations comply with a consistent availability and latency goal without conducting the heavy lifting tasks of database management—reducing the total cost of ownership.

Software delivery using DevOps practices
Rapid market changes require shorter release cycles without sacrificing quality, stability, and security. Tools and processes for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) make it easier for you to plan, manage risk, adapt to evolving customer needs faster, and improve system stability. Release in a fast, consistent, and reliable way by using highly productive tools, automating mundane and manual steps, and iterating in small increments through continuous testing and integration.
Proactively apply policies and controls, and set automated gates as part of the pipeline to move applications between stages seamlessly until they’re made available to customers.
Learn about DevOps and CI/CD
Maximizing automation in operations
With an increasingly complex environment to manage, maximizing the use of automation helps you improve operational efficiency, identify issues before they affect the customer experience, and quickly mitigate issues when they occur. Fully managed platforms provide automated logging, scaling, and high availability. Rich telemetry, actionable alerting, and full visibility into applications and the underlying system are key to a modern application development approach.
Automating regular checkups and applying best practices like infrastructure as code and site reliability engineering promotes resiliency and helps you respond to incidents with minimal downtime and data loss.
Learn more about modern monitoring
Multi-layered security
Modern applications require multilayered security across code, delivery pipelines, app runtimes, and databases. Start by providing developers secure dev boxes with well-governed identity. As part of the DevOps lifecycle, use automated tools to examine dependencies in code repositories and scan for vulnerabilities as you deploy apps to the target environment. Enterprise-grade secrets and policy management encrypt the applications and give the operations team centralized policy enforcement.
With fully managed compute and database services, security control is built in and threat protection is executed in real time.

Empower your people with modern engineering practices
DevOps is the engineering foundation for modern application development. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, you empower your teams to better respond to customer needs, gain confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster. Here are some of the practices that are important to effective DevOps.
Evolve the scope of the team
Shift to a site reliability engineering (SRE) model. Developers become accountable for the performance and stability their changes bring to operations.Enable better collaboration using open-source software and inner-source practices.Accommodate different workstyles to keep productivity high even when working remotely.
See an example of SRE in practice at Microsoft
Create a culture of customer obsession
Collect telemetry data to assess the value that your products bring to your customers.Listen to your customers on social forums and ensure that engineers hear their feedback early and often.Engender customer trust by exposing live-site incidents and creating ways to keep customers informed.
Learn about a new monitoring approach at Microsoft
Adopt a growth mindset
Embrace a continuous learning approach that allows teams to fail fast and incorporate lessons learned into better processes that accelerate innovation.Encourage developers to test and experiment with new ideas. Conduct post-launch review meetings to improve success measurement.Empower developers to use the tools that are most efficient and productive for their individual work styles and that enable them to code from anywhere.

Frequently asked questions
What is a modern application?
Modern applications are cloud-native architectures that leverage packaged code and dependencies in containers and deploy them as microservices to increase developer velocity using DevOps practices. Modern applications leverage automation by incorporating continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, along with automated security to ensure development teams can produce faster and deliver safely.
Where do you draw the boundaries of a microservice?
Start with a domain model. A domain model is an abstract model of the business domain that organizes domain knowledge and provides a common language for developers and domain experts. Derive the microservices from the domain model in a four-step process. Use the link below to learn how to build a domain model into the right microservices for you. Learn more about microservice boundaries.
How can modern architectures enable improved security?
Modern architectures enable improved security by including security through the application lifecycle management (ALM) process. It’s entrenched in the design, development, testing and launch, and reassessment stages. Thus, security is constantly reviewed to ensure compliance. Automation of key security and triggers during ALM and CI/CD pipeline ensure continued security surveillance and reduce manual workload and potential errors. Learn more about security practices for serverless.
When should I use Azure Functions or containers, and which container orchestration service should I choose?
If you have an on-premises app and you don't want to modernize, export it into a container and run it on Kubernetes. This requires minimal code alterations, so the app would run similarly but it could scale much easier. If you want your on-premises app to incorporate Azure Functions, some code must be rewritten to incorporate events and triggers. Alternatively, run Azure Functions in Kubernetes containers, which requires a move to the cloud. Learn more about Azure Functions and AKS.
