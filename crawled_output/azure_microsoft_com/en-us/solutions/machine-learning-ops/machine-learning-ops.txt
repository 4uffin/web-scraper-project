"The solution has increased the robustness of the machine learning system and made our system more aligned with other environments." Luis Arnedo Martinez, Machine Learning Platform Product Manager, Marks & Spencer
Read the story
"We're scaling with automated machine learning in Azure and MLOps capabilities in Azure Machine Learning so that our 15 analysts can focus on more strategic tasks instead of the mechanics of merging spreadsheets and running analyses." Alexandre Biazin, Technology Executive Manager, BRF
Read the story
"Our teams usually test data, get results, and then use it to develop models and algorithms, which we then build into software products. This platform makes the entire process simpler, faster, and more streamlined." Mogens Mikkelsen, Enterprise Architect, SEGES Innovation
Read the story
"Without Azure AI prompt flow, we would have been forced to invest in quite significant custom engineering to deliver a solution. Instead, we were able to achieve great speed by easily integrating our existing microservices into the prompt flow solution, and easily publishing to our managed endpoints." Papinder Dosanjh, Head of Data Science & Machine Learning, ASOS
