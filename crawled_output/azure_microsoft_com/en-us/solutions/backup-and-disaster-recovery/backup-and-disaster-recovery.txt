Overview
Secure, scalable, and cost-effective end-to-end backup and disaster recovery.
How does Azure help you protect critical data and applications?
Azure offers an end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solution that’s simple, secure, scalable, and cost-effective—and can be integrated with on-premises data protection solutions. In the case of service disruption or accidental deletion or corruption of data, it’ll help you recover your business services in a timely and orchestrated manner. The Azure backup and disaster recovery solution is simple to architect, cloud-native, highly available, and resilient.
Learn more about Azure reliability
Simplified management across environments
Extend your current backup solution to Azure, or easily configure our application-aware replication and application-consistent backup that scales based on your business needs. The centralized management interface for Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery makes it simple to define policies to natively protect, monitor, and manage enterprise workloads across hybrid and cloud. These include Azure Virtual Machines, SQL and SAP databases, on-premises Windows servers, and VMware machines.
Azure built-in security controls
Help safeguard your backup environment with built-in security for hybrid and cloud and compliance with wide-ranging security and privacy regulations. With Azure Site Recovery, configure VMs to fail over to the cloud or between cloud datacenters and help secure them with network security groups. Use Azure Backup to protect data from deletion and ransomware by isolating backup data from original data and through accidental delete protection and multifactor authentication.
Learn more about streamlining compliance
Reduced complexity and cost
Achieve low recovery-point objective (RPO) and recovery-time objective (RTO) targets for any mission-critical workload in your organization. Reduce the costs of deploying, monitoring, patching, and scaling on-premises disaster recovery infrastructure, without the need to manage backup resources or build a secondary datacenter. Azure provides a platform for a zero-infrastructure solution, with flexible policies to optimize backup storage.
Extend solutions to Azure with our partners
Work with a preferred backup provider to strengthen your backup and disaster recovery strategy. Through native integration with Azure Blob Storage and extending your existing solution through our partners, you can quickly back up and replicate your apps and data to Azure and store them cost-effectively in a storage tier of choice. This allows for agile recovery of apps and data into Azure for disaster recovery and dev/test scenarios, without the need to learn new tools for configuration or management.
