Make informed decisions about cloud workload design, technology, and implementation
Run high-performing Azure workloads that continuously achieve business value over time with the Well-Architected Framework—a set of proven best practices, guidance, and resources. Get the documentation, tools, assessments, and programs you need to build and operate more secure, higher-performing cloud workloads in a cost-efficient manner.
Understand the five pillars to high-quality workloads
The five pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework are reliability, cost optimization, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and security. While each pillar is important, you can prioritize them based on your workload. Build and manage high-quality workloads using resources that align with Microsoft best practices, guided by the five pillars. These tools, programs, and guidance include the Azure Well-Architected Review, Azure Advisor, comprehensive documentation, partners, support, and service offers, the Azure Architecture Center, and the Well-Architected recommendation process.
Reliability: Meet commitments you make to users and customers
Support application recovery from failures at any scale by architecting reliability into your application framework. In traditional app development, reliability meant purchasing layers of redundant, high-end hardware to prevent app failure completely. Because failure inevitably happens, minimizing the impact of a single component failing is essential. When you build for reliability in the cloud, you help ensure a highly available architecture as well as recovery from failures such as data loss, major downtime, or ransomware incidents.
Explore the documentation
Cost optimization: Get the most value from your cloud investment
Cost optimization for well-architected workloads means reducing unnecessary expenses and improving operational efficiencies. Create economically efficient workloads by balancing business goals with budget justifications. Manage your Azure spending with the tools, offers, and guidance to help you optimize workload costs, save money, understand and forecast your bill.
Learn more
Operational excellence: Keep apps running as expected
In the Well-Architected Framework, operational excellence covers the operations processes that keep applications running in production. Deployments must be reliable and predictable. All systems must be observable because in a large application, logging into virtual machines to troubleshoot an issue or sift through log files is impractical and sometimes impossible. Monitoring and diagnostics provide insight into the system, so that you know when and where failures occur.
Learn more
Performance efficiency: Scale to meet demands dynamically
To achieve performance efficiency for well-architected workloads, you need to be able to anticipate load increases for your cloud environment to meet business requirements. Unlike on-premises environments, you might not need to make long-term predictions for expected changes to maintain capacity. Take both performance requirements and budget into consideration through well-architected principles as you scale up or out with Azure solutions.
Learn more
Security: Strengthen your posture
Well-architected workloads rest on a foundation of highly secure services and practices. Security is a fundamental pillar that helps organizations operate, innovate, and scale. As one of the most important aspects of any architecture, security provides confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances against cyberattacks and abuse of data and systems. Protect workloads with the multilayered security of Azure—across physical datacenters, infrastructure, and operations—and stay ahead of evolving threats using AI. Plus, enlist a team of more than 8,500 global Microsoft cybersecurity experts to help safeguard your assets and data in Azure. This allows your SecOps teams to spend time focusing on what matters most to your business.
Explore the documentation
Make effective design choices for your cloud workloads to deliver value
As you plan your cloud workloads, discover the potential impact of your design decisions—and where to optimize them based on the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework—with an Azure Well-Architected Review. Receive an assessment tailored to your workload type, such as IoT, SAP, data services, and machine learning. Plus, get specific recommendations to act on—whether you’re implementing and deploying an application or reviewing an existing application.

Jump-start workload architecture with reference guides
Start designing and developing well-architected cloud workloads using reference architectures and implementations. Build confidence among your peers that your choices will meet business goals with proven best practices and design patterns. With hundreds of reference architectures in the Azure Architecture Center, you’ll find design principles and GitHub-hosted code samples that serve your app’s purpose and unique context.
Browse reference architectures
Maintain optimized cloud workloads to meet your business needs
After deployment, monitor all aspects of your workload using Azure Advisor, which is based on the Well-Architected Framework. Get an evaluation of your resources deployed in Azure with personalized recommendations alongside industry best practices.
Continually demonstrate value to the business
Prioritize recommendations from Azure Advisor using Advisor score. Assess how well you’re adopting Azure best practices and compare and quantify the impact of the Azure Advisor recommendations you’re already following with the ones you haven’t implemented yet. The gap analysis shows where to optimize your deployments by taking the most impactful actions first. Compare your evaluation with previous results to see changes over time, evaluate progress, and learn about new ways to optimize.
Learn more
Resolve issues with confidence
Implement recommendations from Azure Advisor and Well-Architected reviews more easily with guidance and tools from the Well-Architected recommendation process. Bring recommendations into Azure DevOps, GitHub, or other work management tools as tasks, and generate a presentation to share recommendations with your team.
