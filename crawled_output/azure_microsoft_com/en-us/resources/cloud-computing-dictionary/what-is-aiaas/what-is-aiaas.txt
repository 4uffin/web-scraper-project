What is AIaaS?
Artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS) refers to the provisioning of artificial intelligence (AI) services and tools through a cloud computing platform. AIaaS allows users to access and utilize AI capabilities without the need to invest in and maintain the underlying infrastructure. Businesses and developers can therefore use AI technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision through APIs or other cloud-based services. It provides a more accessible and cost-effective way for organizations to bring AI into their applications and processes.
How does AIaaS work?
Like infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), or software as a service (SaaS), AIaaS follows a cloud service model. Users interact with AIaaS solutions through APIs, seamlessly integrating AI capabilities into their applications, websites, or services. The cloud platforms that host AIaaS provide scalable solutions that allow users to adjust their usage based on application demands and ensure optimal performance.
