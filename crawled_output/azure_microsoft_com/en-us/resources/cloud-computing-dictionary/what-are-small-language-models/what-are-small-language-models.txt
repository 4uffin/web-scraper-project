An overview of small language models (SLMs)
Small language models (SLMs) are computational models that can respond to and generate natural language. SLMs are trained to perform specific tasks using fewer resources than larger models.
Key takeaways
Small language models (SLMs) are a subset of language models that perform specific tasks using fewer resources than larger models.
SLMs are built with fewer parameters and simpler neural architectures than large language models (LLMs), allowing for faster training, reduced energy consumption, and deployment on devices with limited resources.
Potential limitations of SLMs include a limited capacity for complex language and reduced accuracy in complex tasks.
Advantages of using SLMs include lower costs and improved performance in domain-specific applications.
How it works
How do SLMs work?
A small language model (SLM) is a computational model that can respond to and generate natural language. SLMs are designed to perform some of the same natural language processing tasks as their larger, better-known large language model (LLM) counterparts, but on a smaller scale. They’re built with fewer parameters and simpler neural network architectures, which allows them to operate with less computational power while still providing valuable functionality in specialized applications.
Basic architecture
Small language models are build using simplified versions of the artificial neural networks found in LLMs. Language models have a set of parameters—essentially, adjustable settings—that they use to learn from data and make predictions. SLMs contain far fewer parameters than LLMs, making them faster and more efficient than larger models. Where LLMs like GPT-4 can contain more than a trillion parameters, an SLM might only contain a few hundred million. Smaller architecture allows SLMs to perform natural language processing tasks in domain-specific applications, like customer service chatbots and virtual assistants, using much less computational power than LLMs.
Key components
Language models break text into word embeddings—numerical representations that capture the meaning of words—which are processed by a transformer using an encoder. A decoder then produces a unique response to the text.
Training process
Training a language model involves exposing it to a large dataset called a text corpus. SLMs are trained on datasets that are smaller and more specialized than those used by even relatively small LLMs. The dataset SLMs train on is typically specific to their function. After a model is trained, it can be adapted for various specific tasks through fine-tuning.
BENEFITS
The advantages of using small language models
SLMS offer numerous advantages over LLMs:
Lower computational requirements
Small language models require less computational power, making them ideal for environments with limited resources. This efficiency enables the use of these models on smaller devices.
Decreased training time
Small models train faster than larger ones, allowing for quicker iterations and experimentation. Reduced training time accelerates the development process, to facilitate faster deployment and testing of new applications.
Simplified deployment on edge devices
Their compact size and lower resource requirements make SLMs ideal for edge devices. SLMs can run efficiently without needing constant cloud connectivity, improving performance and reliability by processing data locally.
Reduced energy consumption
SLMs use less energy. This makes them more environmentally friendly and cost-effective than LLMs.
Improved accuracy
Because their training is focused on specific tasks, SLMs can provide more accurate responses and information within the areas they’re trained in. Their specialized nature allows for fine-tuning that often outperforms larger models in domain-specific applications.
Lower costs
The reduced computational requirements, training time, and energy consumption of SLMs result in lower overall costs. This affordability makes them accessible to a broader range of people and organizations.
Challenges
Challenges and limitations of SLMs
Small language models are designed to be efficient and lightweight. This design can lead to constraints on their ability to process and understand complex language, potentially reducing their accuracy and performance in handling intricate tasks.
Here are a few common challenges associated with SLMs:
Limited capacity for complex language comprehension: If LLMs pull information from a sprawling, all-encompassing library, SLMs pull from a small section of the library, or maybe even a few highly specific books. This limits the performance, flexibility, and creativity of SLMs in completing complex tasks that benefit from the additional parameters and power of LLMs. SLMs may struggle to grasp nuances, contextual subtleties, and intricate relationships within language, which can lead to misunderstandings or oversimplified interpretations of text.
Potential for reduced accuracy on complex tasks: Small language models often face challenges in maintaining accuracy when tasked with complex problem-solving or decision-making scenarios. Their limited processing power and smaller training datasets can result in reduced precision and increased error rates on tasks that involve multifaceted reasoning, intricate data patterns, or high levels of abstraction. Consequently, they may not be the best choice for applications that demand high accuracy, such as scientific research or medical diagnostics.
Limited performance: The overall performance of small language models is often constrained by their size and computational efficiency. While they are advantageous for quick and cost-effective solutions, they might not deliver the robust performance required for demanding tasks.
These and other limitations make SLMs less effective in applications that require deep learning. Developers should consider the limitations of SLMs against their specific needs.
Types
Types of small language models
SLMs can be categorized into three main types: distilled versions of larger models, task-specific models, and lightweight models.
Distilled versions of larger models
In this approach, a large teacher model is used to train a smaller student model, which learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. The student model retains much of the teacher's knowledge but requires fewer parameters and less computational power. Distillation allows for efficient deployment of language models in environments where resources are limited, while still maintaining a high level of performance. One popular distilled SLM is DistilBERT, which offers comparable performance to its larger counterpart, BERT, but with reduced size and faster inference times.
Task-specific models
Task-specific models are small language models tailored for particular tasks or domains. Unlike general-purpose models like ChatGPT, these models are fine-tuned to excel in specific applications, such as sentiment analysis, translation, or question answering. By focusing on a narrow set of tasks, task-specific models can sometimes achieve higher accuracy and efficiency than more generalized models. They are particularly useful when high performance is needed for a particular task, and the model's scope can be limited to optimize resource usage.
Lightweight models
Lightweight models are built with fewer parameters and architectures optimized to minimize computational demands while still delivering strong performance. They are often used in mobile applications, edge devices, or other scenarios where computational resources are limited.
Use cases
Use cases for SLMs
Small language models are optimized for specific applications, making them ideal for environments with limited resources or specific needs. Some key use cases for SLMs include on-device applications, real-time language processing, and low-resource settings.
On-device applications
SLMs are well-suited for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited, and privacy is a concern. By running directly on devices like smartphones, tablets, and smart speakers, these models can perform tasks such as voice recognition, text prediction, and language translation without relying on constant internet connectivity and cloud computing services. This enhances user privacy by keeping data processing local and improves the responsiveness of applications. Examples include predictive text input, virtual assistants, and offline translation services.
Real-time language processing
In scenarios where quick response times are critical, small language models offer significant advantages because of their fast response time. Real-time language processing is essential in applications like chatbots, customer service automation, and live transcription services. These models can handle language tasks with minimal latency, providing users with immediate feedback and seamless interactions.
Low-resource settings
SLMs are particularly valuable in low-resource settings where computational power and bandwidth are limited. They can be deployed on affordable hardware, which makes them accessible to more people and organizations.
The future of SLMs
Emerging SLM trends and advancements
Small language models represent a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing and machine learning. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has opened up new possibilities for various applications, from customer service to content creation. As language models continues to evolve, SLMs will likely become more sophisticated and offer more capabilities with greater efficiency. Here are a few emerging SLM trends and advancements:
Advancements in model efficiency and compression techniques: Ongoing research is expected to yield more efficient models with improved compression techniques. These advancements will further enhance the capabilities of SLMs, allowing them to tackle more complex tasks while maintaining their smaller size. For instance, the latest version of the Phi-3 SLM now has computer vision capabilities.
Broader applications as edge computing grows: As edge computing becomes more prevalent, SLMs will find applications in a wider range of fields, addressing diverse needs and expanding their reach. The ability to process data locally on edge devices opens new possibilities for real-time and context-aware AI solutions.
Addressing current limitations Efforts to improve accuracy and handle diverse languages are ongoing. By addressing these limitations, researchers aim to enhance the performance of SLMs across different languages and contexts, making them more versatile and capable.
Hybrid models and federated learning: Federated learning and hybrid models are paving the way for more robust and versatile SLMs. Federated learning allows models to be trained across multiple devices without sharing sensitive data, enhancing privacy and security. Hybrid models, which combine the strengths of different architectures, offer new opportunities for optimizing performance and efficiency.
These trends underscore the growing impact of small language models in making AI more accessible, effective, and adaptable to a wide range of applications. As they continue to evolve, SLMs will become essential tools, driving innovation in AI across different environments and industries.
