“It’s been very valuable to us to work with Microsoft as we enhance and expand Pi because the reliability and scale of Azure AI infrastructure is among the best in the world.” Mustafa Suleyman, Cofounder and Chief Executive Officer, Inflection AI​
Read the story
“Our teams usually test [data], get results, and then use it to develop models and algorithms, which we then build into software products. This platform makes the entire process simpler, faster, and more streamlined.” Mogens Mikkelsen, Enterprise Architect, SEGES Innovation
Read the story
“Marks & Spencer has more than 30 million customers and large amounts of data that require systems that can scale to process it. Azure Machine Learning allows us to build machine learning solutions that can scale and give customers the right offers and better service overall.” Luis Arnedo Martinez, Machine Learning Platform Product Manager, Marks & Spencer
Read the story
“Microsoft Azure perfectly complements our digital ecosystem to help deliver the best possible fan experiences for the world's best sports league.” Miguel Ángel Leal, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, LALIGA
Read the story
“Using Azure Machine Learning, we can train a model on multiple distributed datasets. Rather than bringing the data to a central point, we do the opposite. We send the model for training to the participants’ local compute and datasets at the edge and fuse the training results in a foundation model.” Johan Bryssinck, AI/ML Product and Program Management Lead, Swift
