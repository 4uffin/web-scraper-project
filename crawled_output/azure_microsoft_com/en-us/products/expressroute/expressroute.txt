Make your cloud connections fast, reliable, and secure
Get more reliability, faster speed, and lower latency than typical internet connections. In some cases, using ExpressRoute connections to transfer data between on-premises systems and Azure gives you significant cost benefits.
Use a virtual private cloud for storage, backup, and recovery
Forge a fast and reliable connection to Azure with bandwidths up to 100 Gbps, creating an excellent and cost-effective option for scenarios like periodic data migration, replication for business continuity, disaster recovery, and other high-availability strategies.
Extend and connect your datacenters
Create a natural extension to or between your datacenters with high throughput and low latency. Enjoy the scale and economics of the public cloud without compromising network performance.
Build hybrid applications
Use predictable and reliable and connections to build applications that span on-premises infrastructure and Azure without compromising privacy or performance. For example, run a corporate intranet application in Azure that authenticates your customers with on-premises Microsoft Entra ID and serves them without routing traffic through the public internet.
Azure ExpressRoute
Extend your on-premises networks to the Microsoft Cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider. ExpressRoute connections don’t route through the public internet, providing users with more reliability, faster speeds, consistent latency, and higher security.

Azure ExpressRoute Direct
Connect directly to the Microsoft global network. Dedicated dual capacity is available in 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps. ExpressRoute Direct provides massive data ingestion into services like Cosmos DB, physical isolation for regulated industries, and control of circuit distribution by business unit.
Learn more
Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach
Link circuits together for a private connection between your on-premises networks. If you have multiple circuits linking your branch offices to Microsoft, establish ExpressRoute Global Reach connections that allow them to exchange data directly.
Learn more
Azure ExpressRoute Traffic Collector
Enable sampling of network flows sent over an ExpressRoute circuit, and use flow data for network traffic analysis and insights.
Learn more
ExpressRoute circuit
Create a logical connection between your on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft cloud services, deployed with either a connectivity provider or ExpressRoute Direct.
