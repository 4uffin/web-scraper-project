Overview
Buy unused Azure compute capacity at deep discounts
Get more cloud at a lower cost
With Spot Virtual Machines, provision unused Azure compute capacity at deep discounts of up to 90% compared to pay-as-you-go prices. *Pay only up to the maximum price that you set in advance (optional). Spot virtual machine instances are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, providing scalability while reducing costs. Get special Azure pricing and benefits when running Windows Server workloads on spot virtual machines.
Choose from a broad range of VMs for your budget
Spot Virtual Machines pricing might change as necessary and will vary based on available capacity. Workloads will be evicted when the price is higher than the maximum price that you agreed to pay or Azure no longer has available compute capacity and needs to reallocate its resources. Get Spot Virtual Machines pricing for a broad range of VMs and VM scale sets. View the price history and the eviction rate for the spot virtual machines you select.
Learn more
Run recommended workloads
On Spot Virtual Machines, only run applications that can handle interruptions and don't need to be completed within a specific timeframe. Spot Virtual Machines are ideal for Dev/test environments, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workloads, select high-performance computing scenarios, batch processing jobs, or visual rendering applications. Big data, analytics, container-based, and large-scale stateless applications are also ideal workloads for Spot Virtual Machines.

Optimize costs with Spot Virtual Machines
Purchase unused compute capacity at deep discounts of up to 90% compared to pay-as-you-go prices. * If your workload can tolerate interruptions, and its execution time is flexible, using Spot Virtual Machines can significantly reduce the cost of running your workload in Azure. Multiply your cost savings by deploying Spot VMs at scale using Azure Compute Fleet or Virtual Machine Scale Sets. *

FAQ
Frequently asked questions

01/
What is the difference between a spot VM and a regular VM?
A spot VM’s hardware and software are the same as a standard VM, but it is priced at discounted rates with variations in availability. When an extra standard VM is free (not running any workloads), it can be temporarily provisioned as a spot VM at a lower rate, until that VM’s capacity is reclaimed by a customer who has purchased a VM reservation.
02/
When will my workload running on a spot virtual machine be evicted?
Workloads are evicted when Azure no longer has available compute capacity and must reallocate its resources. Workloads will also be evicted when the current price exceeds the maximum price that you agreed to pay before the spot virtual machines were allocated. Additionally, when you subscribe to scheduled events, you get a notification 30 seconds before your workload is evicted. Refer to the documentation for more information.
Read the documentation
03/
Is Azure Spot Virtual Machines the same as low-priority VMs?
Spot Virtual Machines replaced Azure low-priority VMs and includes new capabilities, such as variable pricing. Spot Virtual Machines pricing is also available on both single VMs and VM scale sets.
04/
Why do I have to set maximum prices in US dollars (USD)? Will I have to pay my bill in USD?
For Spot Virtual Machines pricing transparency across all Azure regions and to ensure fairness when allocating available compute capacity, all customers will enter maximum prices in US dollars. You may pay your Azure bill in the local currency for the Euro Zone, Switzerland, Australia, Denmark, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom, India, or Brazil.
05/
What happens upon eviction?
The behavior of an evicted spot virtual machine depends on the eviction policy that you select. If the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, only the VM is deallocated, and no VM-associated charges are incurred. However, other resources, such as disk or network, continue to run and accrue charges. Conversely, if the eviction policy is set to Delete, the VM and all associated resources are deleted. If your spot virtual machine is evicted because of capacity and it's part of a scale set, Azure will try to restore it to maintain a target instance count.
Learn more
06/
What happens to my data when my spot virtual machine is evicted?
If the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, any data stored on disk storage is not deleted. However, all the temporary data that is local to the spot virtual machine is deleted. If the eviction policy is set to Delete, data that's stored on local disks and on any attached persistent disk storage is deleted.
07/
What is the minimum run time for a spot virtual machine?
There is no guaranteed minimum run time for a spot virtual machine. Allocation is based on available unused capacity.
08/
How can I reallocate a spot virtual machine upon eviction?
If the eviction policy is set to Deallocate, you manually restart the spot virtual machine either in the Azure portal or by using a CLA, such as Azure PowerShell. Depending on the available Azure capacity, the spot virtual machine might be reallocated. Single spot virtual machines are always deallocated by Azure. If your spot virtual machine is evicted because of capacity and is part of a scale set, Azure will try to restore the evicted spot virtual machine to maintain a target instance count. Learn more.
09/
Which Azure VMs offer Spot Virtual Machines pricing?
Spot Virtual Machines pricing is available for most Azure VMs, except for suppressed core VMs, promo VMs, and burstable VMs (B-series).
10/
When deployed, are spot virtual machines the same as regular VMs?
Yes. However, there are two important differences. First, spot virtual machines can be evicted, but they give you access to unused Azure compute capacity (VMs) at deep discounts compared to pay-as-you-go prices. Also, unlike regular VMs, a service-level agreement (SLA) isn't available for spot virtual machines. See the product terms for more information.
11/
What type of workloads should I run using Spot Virtual Machines?
Run workloads that can be interrupted and that don’t have to be completed within a specific amount of time.
12/
Can I convert an existing virtual machine scale set to a Spot Virtual Machines scale set?
No. You can only set the spot pricing flag when you create a scale set.
13/
Can I create a virtual machine scale set with both regular VMs and spot virtual machines?
No. This option isn’t supported at this time.
14/
How are quotas managed for Spot Virtual Machines?
Spot Virtual Machines have a separate quota pool, like pay-as-you-go VMs.
Learn more
15/
Can I request an additional quota for Spot Virtual Machines?
Yes. Use the standard quota increase process—the same that you use for pay-as-you-go VMs—to submit a request to increase your quota for Spot Virtual Machines.
Learn more
16/
As a Microsoft partner, how can I access the Spot Virtual Machines service?
To review Spot Virtual Machines availability across the various Azure channels—including cloud service providers (CSPs)—refer to the documentation. Visit Partner Center and contact your Microsoft partner account manager if you have any additional questions.
Learn more
17/
Can I use Spot Virtual Machines with Azure Batch?
Spot Virtual Machines will only be supported for 'virtualMachineConfiguration' pools and not 'cloudServiceConfiguration' pools. Learn more about Spot Virtual Machines on Batch.
Learn more
18/
Can I look up the price history and the eviction rate for the spot virtual machines I select?
Yes, this capability is available to customers in the Azure portal.
19/
Do Spot Virtual Machines have a discount on Enterprise Agreement (EA)?
Spot Virtual Machines already have discounted pricing, and the cost of these virtual machines are also variable in nature. Therefore, there is no additional discount for Spot Virtual Machines under the Enterprise Agreement (EA) and billed at pay-as-you-go rates.
