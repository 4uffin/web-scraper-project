What on-premises Windows Server virtual machines can be migrated to Azure?
A range of guest operating systems can be migrated to Azure. This includes all the supported Windows Server versions and VMs from these VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V environments with Azure Site Recovery. VMs migrated from these on-premises virtualization platforms run as native Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) VMs and aren't dependent on the on-premises hypervisor.
03/
What Microsoft server software is supported in Azure VM environments?
A broad range of Microsoft applications run in Azure VMs, including BizTalk Server 2013 and later versions, Dynamics AX 2012 R3 and later, and Exchange Server 2013 and later versions. For a complete list of supported Microsoft server software, refer to the documentation.
04/
How many different VM types are available in Azure and what type of workloads can they run?
Azure offers a broad range of virtual machines—there’s a VM for every workload. View the entire set of Azure Virtual Machine Series or read the documentation Windows VMs to learn more.
05/
How can I find out which Windows VM best fits my workload?
The Azure VM Series pages and the Azure VM pricing calculator are great resources for helping you determine your VM needs.
06/
How can I check the regional availability of a specific Windows VM?
See Azure products availability by region.
07/
Can I bring my existing Windows Server license to Azure?
As you transition your workloads to Azure, take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit, to use your existing Windows Server licenses with Software Assurance or Windows Server Subscriptions for significant savings on Azure. You can use the benefit with Windows Server Datacenter and Standard edition licenses covered with Software Assurance or Windows Server Subscriptions. Depending on the edition, you can convert or reuse your licenses to run Windows Server virtual machines in Azure and pay a lower base compute rate. For each license, Azure will cover the cost of the OS for up to two virtual machines while you pay just for the base compute VM costs.
08/
Can I migrate my Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 to Azure?
Yes. On January 14, 2020, support for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 ended, which means the end of regular security updates. Rehost your Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 workloads to Azure and get three years of extended security updates at no additional charge and upgrade to a current version when you’re ready. Get the details.
