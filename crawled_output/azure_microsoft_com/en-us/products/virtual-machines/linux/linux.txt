Run Linux virtual machines (VMs) on Azure
Efficiently run Linux workloads on Azure with built-in security and management
Get up and running with your favorite Linux distribution
More than 60% of customer cores in Azure run Linux workloads. Choose from popular Linux distributions including Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Debian, Flatcar, and Oracle Linux. Use preconfigured solutions from Oracle and other open-source VM-compatible providers and find Azure-optimized Linux VM images from publishers of your choice. Get the cloud's only co-located technical support from Azure, Red Hat, and SUSE with just one ticket. Choose the underlying processors—AMD, Arm64, or Intel—that best meet your requirements.
See the supported Linux distributions on Azure
Use the tools and stacks you love
Develop applications in Java, Python, PHP, Node.js, Go, .NET Core, and other technologies and deploy them in Linux VMs. Create your solutions and host Java application servers using Apache Tomcat, Red Hat JBoss, IBM WebSphere, or Oracle WebLogic in Azure VMs. Run databases including MySQL and MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL on Linux, Cassandra, and Redis.
Start building and deploying Java apps on Azure
Buy reservations for your Linux VMs and save up to 72%
Reduce costs—up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go prices—with one-year or three-year terms on Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances for Linux. Combine reserved instances with Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux to use your pre-existing on-premises Red Hat or SUSE software subscriptions on Azure. Alternatively, prepay for your SUSE and Red Hat software usage in Azure to save money compared to pay-as-you-go prices.
Learn more about Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux
Customize and accelerate your Linux VM deployments
Deploy Linux VMs faster through Azure Resource Manager with community-contributed quickstart templates. Provision and manage Linux VMs in Azure using your favorite DevOps tools, including Ansible, OpenShift, Chef, Jenkins, Puppet, and Terraform.
Learn more about Azure Resource Manager
Get built-in security and management for your Linux VMs
Improve the security of your Azure Linux VMs by integrating your workloads with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) authentication. Monitor your VMs by collecting, viewing, and analyzing log data and use extensions to configure diagnostics. Troubleshoot your Linux VMs in production using the virtual machine serial console.

“We have access to incredibly powerful technologies with Azure.... We can provision new resources in only a few hours, which used to take us more than a week, and we can get new solutions to market far faster.”
Paulo Costa, Infrastructure Monitoring and Collaboration Manager
Read the story
“We’re running very large Kubernetes clusters, a large number of nodes, and many Azure virtual machines, so we constantly push the limits, but Azure is extremely fast to adapt.”
Benjamin Pineau, Senior Software Engineer
Read the story
“With our policy-driven architecture, we can put in group policies and security aspects from the start so that we don’t have to redo everything when we set up new servers or virtual machines.”
Carol Wittgren, Head of Digital Acceleration
Read the story
“The self-healing capability of Azure Virtual Machines keeps us more resilient than before. Plus, we get scalability and flexibility, so we can resize an environment far more easily and provision or tear down environments effortlessly, which we couldn’t have done on-premises.”
Rocco Lupoi, DevOps Capability Manager

What Linux distributions does Azure support?
Azure supports all the major Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CoreOS, Debian, Oracle Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, and Ubuntu.
02/
Which on-premises Linux virtual machines can I migrate to Azure?
A range of guest operating systems, including the Azure-endorsed Linux distributions and supported Windows Server versions. Migrate virtual machines from these VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V environments with Azure Site Recovery. VMs migrated from these on-premises virtualization platforms run as native Azure IaaS VMs and aren’t dependent on the on-premises hypervisor.
03/
How many different VM types are available in Azure and what type of Linux-based workloads can they run?
Azure offers a broad range of virtual machines—there’s a VM for every workload. View the entire set of Azure Virtual Machine series or read the documentation for Linux VMs to learn more.
04/
How can I find out which VM best fits my workload?
The Azure VM technical documentation pages, Azure VM series pages, and Azure VM pricing calculator can help you determine your VM needs.
05/
How can I check the regional availability of a specific Linux VM series and size?
See Azure product availability by region.
06/
What support can I get for my Linux VM deployments on Azure?

Yes. Create an Azure free account to learn how Azure works, try products and cloud services, and view tutorials on how to deploy your first solution in 10 minutes or less.
08/
How can I save money with Azure Linux VMs?
There are no upfront costs and you only pay for what you use. Use Azure Reserved VM Instances and save up to 72%. Additionally, through Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux, you can use your pre-existing on-premises Red Hat or SUSE software subscriptions on Azure. Alternatively, pre-pay for your SUSE and Red Hat software usage in Azure, and save money over pay-as-you-go prices.
09/
Do you offer discounts for development and testing?
Yes. Learn more about Azure dev/test pricing and take advantage of discounts on a variety of other Azure services.
10/
How does Azure compare to other cloud providers?
More than 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure. Azure has more global regions than any cloud provider and offers the most comprehensive set of compliance offerings. Azure offers built-in support for the most popular integrated development environments trusted by more than 20 million developers—Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. And, according to the Linux Foundation, Microsoft is a significant contributor to the Linux kernel.
11/
How can I migrate my on-premises VMs to Azure?
There are several Microsoft and partner tools and a large ecosystem of partners to help migrate on-premises VMs to Azure. Visit the Azure cloud migration and modernization center to learn more about this comprehensive approach.
12/
How do I create Linux VMs in Azure?
Create Linux virtual machines in Azure through the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. The Azure portal provides a browser-based user interface to create VMs and associated resources. Use the Azure PowerShell module to create and manage Azure resources from the PowerShell command line or in scripts. Use the Azure CLI to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts.
Read the documentation
13/
What are the SLAs for Azure Linux VMs?
Microsoft offers a range of OS-independent SLAs for Azure VMs. Read the SLA for Azure Virtual Machines.
14/
What disk storage options are there for provisioning new Azure Linux VMs?
Most Azure VMs come with temporary non-persistent local storage. Additionally, Azure offers HDD and SSD storage for data. Learn more about Azure Disk Storage. Refer to the Azure VM technical documentation to learn about the Azure disks that are available for each VM series.
15/
What are Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets?
Virtual Machine Scale Sets help you create and manage a group of load-balanced and autoscaling VMs. Deploy virtual machine scale sets using Azure Resource Manager templates, which support Windows and Linux platform images and custom images and extensions.
16/
Can I use my existing on-premises Linux software subscriptions on Azure?
Take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit to use your existing on-premises Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server subscriptions when you convert your Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pay-as-you-go Azure VMs to bring-your-own-subscription billing. Typically, VMs deployed from pay-as-you-go images on Azure will incur both an infrastructure fee and a software fee. With Azure Hybrid Benefit, pay-as-you-go VMs can be converted to a bring-your-own-subscription billing model without a redeployment, so you can avoid any risk of downtime. Refer to the documentation for more information.
