01/
What is Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server?
Azure Hybrid Benefit is special pricing designed to help you maximize the value of your current licensing investments while accelerating your migration to the cloud. There’s no application process or waiting period.     Read the Azure Hybrid Benefit FAQ.
02/
Which operating systems are supported?
Azure offers preconfigured SQL Server virtual machine images.
Learn about Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows Server.

What’s the status of the SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines Ultra Disk Storage offering?
Azure Ultra Disk Storage is now generally available. Learn more.
04/
Do I need to have active Software Assurance on SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014 licenses to qualify for three years of extended support in Azure IaaS?
SQL Server 2012 Extended Support ended on July 12, 2022 and SQL Server 2014 Extended Support will end on July 9, 2024. If you have SQL Server 2012 or SQL Server 2014 but don't have Software Assurance, you can still migrate to Azure and get Extended Security Updates free.
Learn more.
05/
What are the differences between SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines and Azure SQL Managed Instance?
SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines is a fast and straightforward migration infrastructure as a service (IaaS) option, but it requires a more hands-on approach to database administration. You'll continue to purchase, install, and manage your own software, including operating systems and applications. Azure SQL Managed Instance, as a platform as a service (PaaS), eliminates day-to-day administration but may require changes to the application code. Automated features boost performance and data protection, while serverless and hyperscale automatically scale compute and storage.

Price-performance claims are based on a May 2023 study commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by GigaOm. The study compared price performance between workloads on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 in Azure with Premium SSD v2 Managed Disks and Amazon Web Services on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 with General Purpose (gp3) volumes. Benchmark data is from the GigaOm Transactional Field Test, a subset of TPC Benchmark™ E (TPC-E). Please note that the Field Test does not implement the full TPC-E benchmark and is not comparable to any published TPC-E benchmarks. Prices are based on May 2023 US pricing, incorporating three-year reservations for Azure and AWS compute pricing, Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server, and License Mobility for AWS, excluding Software Assurance and support costs. Actual results and prices may vary based on configuration.
