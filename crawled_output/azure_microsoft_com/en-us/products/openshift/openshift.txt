01/
What is Azure Red Hat OpenShift?
Azure Red Hat OpenShift is a fully managed OpenShift service on Microsoft Azure, co-managed by Microsoft and Red Hat. It combines the power of Red Hat OpenShift, an enterprise Kubernetes platform, with the scalability, security, and integration features of Azure. Deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications on Azure while benefiting from automated updates, monitoring, and security patches. Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides a robust environment for building, deploying, and managing cloud-native applications.
02/
How does Azure Red Hat OpenShift compare to Kubernetes?
Azure Red Hat OpenShift builds upon Kubernetes with a complete, enterprise-ready platform. Unlike basic Kubernetes, it includes pre-integrated components: container management, automation, networking, CI/CD, monitoring, registry, and authentication—all tested together. Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides fully managed operations with automated upgrades, enhanced security, integrated developer tools, and simplified management through the Azure portal with unified billing and support.
03/
Can I switch from using Kubernetes to Azure Red Hat OpenShift?
Yes. Switching to Azure Red Hat OpenShift is seamless because it's built on upstream Kubernetes projects. Transition with minimal disruption while keeping your preferred languages, frameworks, and databases. Your Kubernetes resources will be compatible, and you'll gain access to embedded CI/CD, a container catalog, and image streams. Or, use your existing pipeline with Azure Red Hat OpenShift for a smooth migration, enhancing development with enterprise features and managed services benefits.
04/
Do I need a separate contract with Red Hat to use the service?
No, you don't need to sign a contract with Red Hat. Azure Red Hat OpenShift billing falls under Azure paid services.
05/
Who should I contact for support?
Request support in the Azure portal. Microsoft and Red Hat engineers will triage and address your request.
06/
Where is Azure Red Hat OpenShift available?
Review the product availability by region page for more information.
View availability by region
07/
What is the SLA?
Azure Red Hat OpenShift provides a service-level agreement (SLA) of 99.95% availability. Review the SLA page for more information.
08/
What is OpenShift?
OpenShift is Red Hat's enterprise Kubernetes platform that enhances standard Kubernetes with a suite of tools for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications at scale. It integrates developer workflows, CI/CD pipelines, security controls, monitoring solutions, and automated operations to provide a complete container platform that simplifies development and operations tasks. It’s available either as self-managed software or as managed cloud services like Azure Red Hat OpenShift.
09/
Is Azure Red Hat OpenShift a CaaS or a PaaS?
Azure Red Hat OpenShift is primarily a platform as a service (PaaS), offering a complete platform for building, deploying, and managing applications with integrated tools for CI/CD, security, and monitoring. While it’s built on Kubernetes (often categorized as a CaaS or Container as a Service), Azure Red Hat OpenShift goes beyond container orchestration by providing a higher-level solution for application management, making it more of a PaaS with container orchestration capabilities.
10/
What are the requirements for OpenShift in Azure?
See this page for requirements
11/
How many worker nodes are supported per cluster?
Up to 250 worker nodes.
12/
Do I need to make an upfront commitment?
No. You can start an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster and pay as you go, or purchase a reserved instance to save costs.
