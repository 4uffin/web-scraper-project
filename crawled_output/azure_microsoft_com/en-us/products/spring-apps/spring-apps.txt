Frequently asked questions about Azure Spring Apps
How does Azure Spring Apps help secure my data?
Azure helps ensure that only authorized users access application data, logs, and configurations. The service instances in Azure Spring Apps are isolated from one another and deployed to security-hardened Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Use additional security features such as network isolation with Azure Virtual Network, enforced organizational compliance standards with Azure Policy, and the ability to connect to other Azure services with managed identities.
Where is the service available?
View availability by region.
What is the service-level agreement (SLA)?
View SLA details: Licensing Documents (microsoft.com).
What types of applications does Azure Spring Apps support?
Azure Spring Apps supports all types of Spring applications: Spring Boot, microservices, reactive, cloud, web apps, serverless, event driven, and batch. You can also run Steeltoe .NET core apps alongside Spring apps in Standard, and polyglot apps in Enterprise.
Do my Spring apps remain portable after I migrate them to Azure Spring Apps?
Spring apps are naturally portable. You can deploy them anywhere, including to  Azure. Simply deploy JAR or WAR files to Azure Spring Apps and keep your apps portable. If you were to create additional artifacts such as platform-specific deployment descriptors or HELM charts, then you might impact portability.
