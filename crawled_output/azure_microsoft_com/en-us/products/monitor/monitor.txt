01/
What’s the difference between Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights?
Microsoft combined three unique services—Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights—under the umbrella of Azure Monitor to provide powerful end-to-end monitoring of your applications and the components they rely on. Log Analytics and Application Insights are now features of Azure Monitor. The log data engine and query language of Log Analytics is now referred to as Azure Monitor Logs
02/
How do I enable Azure Monitor?
Azure Monitor is enabled the moment you create a new Azure subscription, and activity log and platform metrics are automatically collected. Create diagnostic settings to collect more detailed information about the operations of your Azure resources, and add monitoring solutions and insights to provide extra analysis on collected data for particular services.
03/
Is there an on-premises version of Azure Monitor?
No. Azure Monitor is a scalable cloud service that processes and stores large amounts of data, although Azure Monitor can monitor resources that are on-premises and in other clouds.
04/
Does Azure Monitor integrate with System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)?
You can easily migrate your SCOM deployments to the cloud with Azure Monitor SCOM managed instance, a scalable, cloud monitoring service that combines the latest SCOM capabilities with the benefits of a fully managed and evergreen platform as a service (PaaS), on Azure Monitor.
