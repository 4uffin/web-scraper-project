01/
What is Azure Managed Redis?
Azure Managed Redis delivers the latest Redis innovations tailored for hyperscale cloud environments with up to 99.999% industry-leading availability. With flexible performance and memory options, Azure Managed Redis provides a low total cost of ownership (TCO) to meet diverse and mission-critical workload needs.
02/
What are the benefits of using Azure Managed Redis?
Azure Managed Redis offers fast, cost-effective data access, reducing latency for high-demand applications and AI-powered apps. It scales easily to handle growing workloads, supports seamless updates, and minimizes operational overhead. With advanced features like geo-replication and data persistence, it ensures high availability. Enhanced security through network isolation, Microsoft Entra ID authentication, and built-in monitoring all simplify management while saving costs.
03/
What is the difference between Azure Managed Redis and Azure Cache for Redis?
Azure Managed Redis is a new service that brings the latest Redis innovations across all tiers with competitive pricing. It also offers non-high availability options to help further reduce TCO. This transition is designed to improve application performance and scalability, making it especially beneficial for AI use cases.
We will continue to offer Azure Cache for Redis in general availability (GA) and recommends using it for your production workloads.
04/
How does Azure Managed Redis improve application performance?
Unlike traditional databases that rely on slower disk-based storage, Azure Managed Redis stores data in memory. This allows for much faster data writing and retrieval since memory is significantly quicker than disk storage.
05/
Can Azure Managed Redis be used with other Azure services?
Azure Managed Redis enhances application performance and scalability when used with Azure services, acting as an optimal caching layer for Azure databases to maintain low TCO. Additionally, it interoperates smoothly with Azure Functions, accelerating event-driven actions for efficient performance.
06/
What types of data can I store in Azure Managed Redis?
Azure Managed Redis supports data types such as:   Strings for key-value pairs Hashes for collections of key-value pairs Lists for ordered collections Sets for unique elements Sorted sets for ranked elements Bitmaps for bit-level operations HyperLogLog for approximating unique counts Geospatial indexes for geographic data Streams for log-based data sequences
07/
What is the pricing for Azure managed Redis?
