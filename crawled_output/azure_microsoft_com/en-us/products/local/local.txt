FAQ
Frequently asked questions

01/
What is Azure Local?
Azure Local is full-stack infrastructure software that runs directly on bare metal hardware validated by OEM partners. With it, you can run containers, virtual machines, and some Azure services at distributed locations with central management from the cloud, enabled by Azure Arc. Microsoft provides and supports the complete software stack, so you don’t need separate tools or vendors for the underlying virtualization or storage.
02/
How is Azure Local related to Azure Arc?
Azure Arc is a bridge that extends Azure to existing environments and other clouds. Azure Local is an infrastructure solution that includes the capabilities of Azure Arc built-in and sets up automatically. Use Azure Local when you need new or refreshed infrastructure at distributed locations. Use Azure Arc when your environment already has infrastructure.
03/
Is Azure Local managed by Microsoft?
No, customers own the hardware and have operational control of their Azure Local environment. Day-to-day monitoring, management, support, and other functions are surfaced through Azure tools, but actions are customer-initiated. For example, when a software update is available, a notification appears in the Azure portal prompting you to apply the update. Customers may choose to outsource some or all operations to their solution vendor or another professional services provider.
04/
What happened to Azure Stack HCI?
Azure Stack HCI is now part of Azure Local. The same features and functionality continue to be offered in Azure Local. Azure Local provides additional flexibility: it supports smaller and larger deployments, more hardware, disconnected operations, and other capabilities such as new supported Azure services.
05/
How do I buy Azure Local?
Review networking requirements and other prerequisites, and then browse the solutions catalog to find validated hardware from your preferred vendor. Many solutions come with the Azure Local software preinstalled and ready to use. If not, you can download and install Azure Local from the Azure portal. Once installed, Azure Local connects to Azure for day-to-day monitoring, management, support, and other functions. Azure Local is billed automatically to your Azure subscription—see pricing for details.
