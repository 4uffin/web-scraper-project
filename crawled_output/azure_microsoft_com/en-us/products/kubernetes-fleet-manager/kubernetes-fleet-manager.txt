Seamlessly manage Kubernetes clusters at scale
Easily handle multicluster scenarios for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters such as workload propagation, north-south load balancing (for traffic flowing into member clusters), and upgrade orchestration across multiple clusters.
Fleet cluster enables centralized management of all your clusters at scale
Managed hub cluster takes care of the upgrades and Kubernetes cluster configuration for you
Kubernetes configuration propagation lets you use policies and overrides to disseminate objects across fleet member clusters
North-south load balancer orchestrates traffic flow across workloads deployed in multiple member clusters of the fleet
Group and organize all your AKS clusters
Group any combination of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to simplify multi-cluster workflows like Kubernetes configuration propagation and multi-cluster networking.
Get a managed hub cluster
Fleet requires a hub Kubernetes cluster to store configurations for placement policy and multicluster networking. Rely on a managed Kubernetes cluster to handle upgrades and cluster configuration operations automatically, so you can focus on other priorities.
Propagate Kubernetes configurations across clusters
Define propagation policies to control how the Kubernetes configurations created on the fleet resource need to be propagated to all or a subset of the member clusters.
Orchestrate multi-cluster networking scenarios
Set up load balancing for north-south traffic (flowing from the user into the cluster) for multiple endpoints deployed across member clusters.
Comprehensive security and compliance, built in
Microsoft invests more than $1 billion annually on cybersecurity research and development.
We employ more than 3,500 security experts who are dedicated to data security and privacy.

Pricing for Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager
There's no charge for the Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager resource itself. You'll only incur charges for the AKS cluster created by Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager on your behalf. AKS charges will include the virtual machines and associated storage and networking resources consumed for the AKS cluster.
See the AKS pricing page for more details
