Frequently asked questions about Azure Sphere
Expand all
|
Collapse all
Can I buy just one component of Azure Sphere—the Azure Sphere–certified silicon, the Azure Sphere OS, or the Azure Sphere Security Service?
No. Azure Sphere components are tightly integrated to help ensure a secure and simplified device. They are sold together for a one-time cost and cannot be purchased separately.
Does Microsoft manufacture Azure Sphere chips?
No. Microsoft works with a diverse group of expert hardware manufacturers and their broad ecosystem of vendors to design specialized Azure Sphere–certified chips that meet the needs of various markets. Extensive research and testing contribute to the development of the security technology and architecture for each chip.
Does Azure Sphere require an Azure subscription or monthly payments?
No, Azure Sphere doesn't require you to pay ongoing fees. The one-time cost you pay for your chip includes access to the Azure Sphere OS and cloud-based security service, plus OS updates for the lifetime of your chip.
Can Azure Sphere help me secure my existing devices?
Yes, Azure Sphere guardian devices can help you protect the connection-capable devices and equipment already deployed within your organization. Guardian modules require little or no equipment redesign. They process data and control equipment without ever exposing the equipment to the network. Guardian modules protect your operational equipment from disabling attacks, simplify device retrofit projects, and boost efficiency through over-the-air (OTA) updates and IoT connectivity.
Does my entire environment need to be on Azure to use Azure Sphere?
No. Azure Sphere is engineered to integrate with any cloud service—public or private. You can connect to other clouds for app data while running Azure Sphere or optimize efficiencies by using Azure Sphere alongside Visual Studio and Azure IoT.
How does Azure Sphere relate to Windows IoT?
Azure Sphere complements Windows IoT. Windows IoT provides a best-in-class solution for devices with rich user experiences. Azure Sphere fortifies IoT devices with Microsoft security innovations and expertise in hardware, software, and the cloud.
What is the Azure Sphere vulnerability disclosure policy?
Azure Sphere supports coordinated vulnerability disclosure and encourages responsible reporting to Microsoft by security researchers and customers. If you believe you have discovered a security-related vulnerability with Azure Sphere or have been affected by one, please contact us. Include clear, concise, and reproducible steps, documented either in writing or video format, to help the security response team quickly reproduce, understand, and address the issue.
How is Azure Sphere licensed?
When you purchase the Azure Sphere solution from a distributor, you receive the following: An Azure Sphere certified MCUA license and device access to the Azure Sphere Security ServiceAn Azure Sphere OS license, which includes ongoing Azure Sphere OS updates These components will be packaged and sold together by our distributors for one low price.
Does the Azure Sphere Security Service require a subscription fee?
No. There is no ongoing subscription fee or consumption fees associated with your Azure Sphere purchase or the Azure Sphere Security Service. There is never an additional cost for Azure Sphere beyond the initial, one-time purchase price. However, if you build an application for Azure Sphere that consumes other Azure services, normal Azure consumption charges for those services apply.
Do organizations need to be Azure cloud customers to use Azure Sphere? Are they required to use Visual Studio for development?
No. The Azure Sphere Security Service is engineered to let device manufacturers integrate with the tools and services they already use. While the Azure Sphere Security Service runs in Azure, our customers have the choice to connect to any proprietary or public cloud for app data, and a choice in which development tools they use. Leveraging Visual Studio and Azure IoT services, however, allows organizations to develop applications for Azure Sphere more efficiently.
Is a Visual Studio license required to use the Azure Sphere development tools?
Yes. Proper licensing of Visual Studio is required to use the Visual Studio Tools for Azure Sphere. Visual Studio has a number of licensing options, including a generous, free community license.
In which countries or regions is Azure Sphere commercially available?
