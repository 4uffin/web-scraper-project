01/
What is GitHub Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps developers write code faster with less effort. It provides contextual assistance, offering coding suggestions as developers type, which could be a line completion or a whole new block of code. This helps developers focus more on problem-solving, collaboration, and innovation. Integrated with leading editors and natively built into GitHub, it’s the most widely adopted AI developer tool, enhancing job satisfaction and productivity.
02/
What is the difference between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise plans?
Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features Copilot in the coding environment. It also includes Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business and adds an additional layer of customization. Additionally, GitHub Copilot Enterprise has Copilot integrated into GitHub.com as a chat interface to enable developers to converse with Copilot about their codebase and action buttons throughout the platform.
03/
What languages, integrated development environments (IDEs), and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?
GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through the GitHub command line interface (CLI).
04/
How can developers collaborate using GitHub Enterprise?
Developers can collaborate with GitHub Enterprise using a variety of tools that are built into the platform, including pull requests, GitHub Projects, and GitHub Discussions.
05/
Can I use GitHub Copilot without GitHub Enterprise? What about with Azure DevOps?
GitHub Copilot Business can be used on any DevOps platform, including Azure DevOps. However, many of the newest agentic capabilities —like coding agent —require GitHub repositories. Contact Sales to learn more.

06/
What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?
GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
07/
What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?
GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used, whether via GitHub.com, the GitHub mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the CLI, IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include user engagement data, prompts, suggestions, and feedback data.
08/
Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?
No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise data to train its models.
