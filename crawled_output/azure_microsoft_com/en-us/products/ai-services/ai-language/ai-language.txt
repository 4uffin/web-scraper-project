01/
What is Azure AI Language?
Azure AI Language offers advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities out of the box and customizable AI models including personal data redaction, entity extraction, summarization, intent classification, question answering, text analytics for health, etc. The service uses state-of-the-art transformer models with large and small language models (i.e. LLMs and SLMs), making it easier to develop intelligent multilingual applications through scalable and reliable APIs, SDK, and Azure AI Foundry.
02/
What are the benefits of using Azure AI Language?
Azure AI Language empowers developers to build language AI apps at scale with high quality and low latency. It reduces prompt engineering through prebuilt capabilities on fine-tuned models. PII redaction protects privacy data. Entity extraction enables factual checks to reduce inaccuracies. Summarization offers options to chapter meeting per topic. Conversational language understanding and custom question answering make it easy to build bots that classify user intents and answer questions.
03/
How can I get started with Azure AI Language?
Try out the prebuilt capabilities in Azure AI Foundry, without requiring an account. Then create your Azure AI resource in the studio to access all the capabilities to build your apps. Check out Azure AI Language documentation for more details about each capability, and the developer guide to get access to client libraries, REST API and sample code.
04/
What languages does Azure AI Language support?
See each feature's supported languages in the Azure AI Language documentation for more information.
05/
Can I use more than one Language feature in the same API call?
Yes, use the analyze operation to combine more than one feature in the same asynchronous call. The analyze operation is currently only available in the Standard pricing tier and follows the same pricing criteria.
