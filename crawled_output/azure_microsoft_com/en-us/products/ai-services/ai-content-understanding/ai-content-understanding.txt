Features
Multimodal AI: Transforming data into insights
Multimodal data ingestion
Ingest a range of modalities—such as documents, images, audio, or video—and use a range of AI models available in Azure AI to transform input data into structured output that can be easily processed and analyzed by downstream applications.
Customizable output schemas
Customize the schemas of extracted results to meet your specific needs. Tailor the format and structure of summaries, insights, or features to include only the most relevant details—such as key points or timestamps—from video or audio files.
Confidence scores
Utilize confidence scores to reduce human intervention and increase accuracy with continuous improvement through user feedback.
Output ready for downstream applications
Automate business processes by building enterprise AI apps or agentic workflows. Use outputs that downstream applications can consume for reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
Grounding
Ensure the information extracted, inferred, or abstracted is represented in the underlying content.
Automatic labeling
Save time and effort on manual annotation and create models quicker by using large language models (LLMs) to extract fields from various document types.

01/
What is Azure AI Content Understanding?
Content Understanding is a new Azure AI service that helps enterprises accelerate multimodal AI app development in the age of generative AI. Content Understanding takes diverse types of input data—ranging from text, audio, images, documents, and video—and enables organizations to build generative AI solutions seamlessly with the latest models available. AI can already analyze docs, build bots, and recognize faces. Content Understanding offers a new opportunity for enterprises to develop applications that can combine all of these using prebuilt templates designed to address the most common use-cases, or they can build custom models to address domain-specific or enterprise-specific use cases—all without ever requiring specialized generative AI skills such as prompt engineering. The service allows enterprises to bring their domain expertise and build automation workflows, continuously improving the output and always ensuring robust accuracy. This new AI service is built using industry-leading Azure enterprise security, data privacy, and responsible AI guidelines.
