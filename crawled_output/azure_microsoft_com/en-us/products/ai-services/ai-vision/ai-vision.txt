Frequently asked questions

01/
Where is Azure AI Vision available?
See availability by region
02/
What is the SLA for Azure AI Vision?
Azure AI Vision and other Azure AI services guarantee 99.9% availability. No service level agreement (SLA) is provided for the free pricing tier.
See SLA details
03/
Do you store my images or videos or use them for product improvements?
No. Microsoft automatically deletes your images and videos after processing and does not train on your data to enhance the underlying models. Video data does not leave your premises, and video data is not stored on the edge where the container runs. Learn more about privacy and terms of usage.
Learn more about privacy and terms
04/
Does spatial analysis detect faces or a person’s identity?
No, spatial analysis detects and locates human presence in video footage and outputs a bounding box around each person detected. The AI models do not detect faces nor determine individuals’ identities nor demographics.
05/
How does Azure AI Vision analyze people in a physical space?
The spatial analysis AI models detect and track movements in the video feed based on algorithms that identify the presence of one or more humans by a body bounding box. For each person and bounding box detected in a zone in the camera field of view, the AI models output event data including bounding box coordinates of a person’s body, event type (for example, zone entry or exit, or directional line crossing), pseudonymous identifiers to track the bounding box, and a detection confidence score. This event data is sent to your own instance of Azure IoT Hub.
06/
Do I need to use my own data for training my custom model?
Yes. Because model customization is designed to be fine-tuned for your scenario, you need to provide labeled data to train your model.
07/
How much data do I need?
The model customization feature of the service is optimized to quickly recognize major differences between images, so you can start prototyping your model with a small amount of data. You may start with as little as one image per label. If you have more labeled images, you may add more. Depending on the complexity of the problem and degree of accuracy required, you can continue adding additional images per label to improve your model.
08/
Is the Vision Studio user interface a website or a service?
It’s both. You can use the site to access a graphical interface for managing datasets, training, and evaluation of models for a no-code experience. Or, as an alternative, you can use the AI Vision APIs.
09/
How do I label the data for model customization?
You can label the images in Azure Machine Learning studio, which is integrated with Vision Studio for easy export of labeled data. You can also label the data in the Common Objects in Context (COCO) file format and import the COCO file directly into Vision Studio. Vision Studio is a set of UI-based tools that let you explore, build, and integrate features from Azure AI Vision.
See documentation for details
10/
How is the model customization feature different from Custom Vision?
The model customization feature for Azure AI Vision is the next generation of Custom Vision, with improved accuracy and few-shot learning capabilities. You may continue to use Custom Vision, or you can migrate your training data to retrain your model with model customization from Azure AI Vision.
See documentation for details
11/
What other services can I use with Azure AI Vision?
After using Azure AI Vision to extract insights and text from images and video, you can use text analytics to analyze sentiment, Azure AI Translator to translate text into your desired language, or Immersive Reader to read the text aloud, making it more accessible. Related services and capabilities include Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract key-value pairs and tables from documents, Azure AI Video Indexer for extracting advanced metadata from audio and video files, and Azure AI Content Safety to detect unwanted text or images.
