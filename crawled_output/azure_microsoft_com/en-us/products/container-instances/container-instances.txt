OVERVIEW
What can you build with Azure Container Instances?
Develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or learning new tools—it's just your application, in a container, running in the cloud.
Elastic bursting with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Container Instances provides fast, isolated compute to meet traffic that comes in spikes, without the need to manage servers. For example, AKS uses the Virtual Kubelet to provision pods inside Container Instances that start in seconds. AKS runs with just enough capacity for your average workload. As you run out of capacity in your AKS cluster, scale out additional pods in Container Instances without additional servers to manage.
Event-driven applications with Azure Logic Apps
Combine Container Instances with its Logic Apps connector, Azure queues, and Azure Functions to build robust infrastructure that elastically scales out containers on demand. Container Instances allows you to run complex tasks that can respond to events.
Data processing jobs
Use Container Instances for data processing where source data is ingested, processed, and placed in a durable store such as Azure Blob Storage. By processing the data with Container Instances rather than statically provisioned virtual machines, you achieve significant cost savings through per-second billing.
CAPABILITIES
Key Features
Run containers without managing servers
Running your workloads in Container Instances empowers you to focus on designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs them.
Increase agility with containers on demand
Deploy containers to the cloud with unprecedented simplicity and speed—with a single command. Use Container Instances to provision additional compute for demanding workloads whenever you need to. For example, with the Virtual Kubelet, use Container Instances to elastically burst from your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when traffic comes in spikes.
Secure applications with hypervisor isolation
Gain the security of virtual machines for your container workloads, while preserving the efficiency of lightweight containers. Container Instances provides hypervisor isolation for each container group so containers run in isolation without sharing a kernel.
