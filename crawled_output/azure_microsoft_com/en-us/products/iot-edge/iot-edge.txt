Cloud intelligence deployed locally on IoT edge devices
Deploy Azure IoT Edge on premises to break up data silos and consolidate operational data at scale in the Azure Cloud. Remotely and securely deploy and manage cloud-native workloads—such as AI, Azure services, or your own business logic—to run directly on your IoT devices. Optimize cloud spend and enable your devices to react faster to local changes and operate reliably even in extended offline periods.
Certified IoT Edge hardware: Works with your Linux or Windows devices that support container engines
Runtime: Free and open-source under the MIT license to give you more control and code flexibility
Modules: Docker-compatible containers from Azure services or Microsoft partners to run your business logic at the edge
Cloud interface: Remotely manage and deploy workloads from the cloud through Azure IoT Hub with zero-touch device provisioning
Simplify development
Use existing developer skillsets and code in a language you know. IoT Edge code is consistent across the cloud and the edge, and it supports languages such as C, C#, Java, Node.js, and Python.

Learn how to prepare your development and test environment
Remotely monitor devices at scale
Remotely monitor IoT Edge devices at scale with Azure Monitor integration. Use built-in metrics and curated visualizations to gain deep visibility into the health and performance of your edge applications right in the Azure portal. Combine on-demand device logs with IoT Edge for best-in-class edge observability.
Learn more about Azure Monitor integration
Reduce IoT solution costs
Only a small fraction of IoT edge data acquired is meaningful post-analytics. Use services such as Azure Stream Analytics or cloud-trained machine learning models to process the data locally and send only what’s needed to the cloud for further analysis. This reduces the cost associated with sending all your data to the cloud while maintaining high data quality.
Get started with Azure Stream Analytics on IoT Edge
Operate offline or with intermittent connectivity
Operate your edge devices reliably and securely, even when they’re offline or they have intermittent connectivity to the cloud. Azure IoT Edge device management automatically syncs the latest state of your devices after they’re reconnected to ensure seamless operability.

Frequently asked questions about Azure IoT Edge
Current operational status Product availability by region Service-level agreement (SLA)
What are the components of IoT Edge?
IoT Edge has three components. IoT Edge modules are containers that run Azure services, third-party services, or custom code. They are deployed to IoT Edge-enabled devices and execute locally on those devices. The IoT Edge runtime runs on each IoT Edge-enabled device and manages the modules deployed to each device. The cloud-based interface remotely monitors and manages IoT Edge-enabled devices.
What are some other features?
IoT Edge also offers: Zero-touch provisioning of edge devices.Security manager with support for hardware-based root of trust.Extended offline operation.Integration with Azure Monitor for best-in-class observability.Automatic Device Configuration Service for scaled deployment and configuration of edge devices.Support for SDKs in C, C#, Node, Python, and Java.Tooling for module development, including coding, testing, debugging, and deployment.CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps.
How does IoT Edge work with open-source technologies?
IoT Edge is among the most open edge platforms available today, and Microsoft is committed to using open-source technologies to deliver innovations at the edge. The IoT Edge runtime is open-sourced under the MIT license to give you more control and flexibility with the code. IoT Edge supports the Moby container management system, which extends the concepts of containerization, isolation, and management from the cloud to devices at the edge.
