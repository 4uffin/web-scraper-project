OVERVIEW
Manage and protect app configurations efficiently
Configure, store, and retrieve parameters and settings
Store configurations for all your Azure apps in a universal, hosted location. Manage configurations effectively and reliably, in real time, without affecting customers by avoiding time-consuming redeployments. App Configuration is built for speed, scalability, and security.
Respond in real time to changing demands
Toggle specific features behind feature flags, and fix critical problems in real time. The flexibility provided by avoiding costly redeployments gives you more control when it matters the most.
Reduce configuration complexity across multiple environments
Modern programs, especially those running in a cloud, have several distributed components. Spreading configuration settings across these components leads to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during application deployments. Using a universal configuration store for all your settings helps eliminate these errors.
Improve security by separating configuration from code
Help secure your apps by keeping data separate from code. Storing configuration settings in a hosted environment helps keep data secure as long as you need.

01/
What does App Configuration do?
App Configuration helps you manage application settings and control their access centrally. It also simplifies your deployment tasks and eases the burden of dealing with permutations of configurations created by multiple applications, dependencies, and environments.
02/
How is App Configuration different from Azure Key Vault?
App Configuration is complementary to Key Vault. They’re typically used side by side to store and distribute application configuration data. While Key Vault is designed for secret management and operations, App Configuration is optimized for hierarchical and/or dynamic application settings.
03/
Where is App Configuration available?
App Configuration is available in Azure regions.
