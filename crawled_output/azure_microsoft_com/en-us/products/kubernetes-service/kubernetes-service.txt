01/
What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is open-source software for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. It orchestrates a cluster of Azure virtual machines, schedules containers, automatically manages service discovery, incorporates load balancing, tracks resource allocation, and manages the health of individual resources using automatic restart and replication. AKS is a managed service that automates provisioning, upgrading, on-demand scaling, and other Kubernetes management tasks.
Learn more about Kubernetes
02/
What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies cluster management and reduces operational overhead. It offers automatic scaling for seamless application scaling, enterprise-grade security features, and integration with popular development tools and CI/CD pipelines. AKS ensures high availability with SLA-backed uptime, continuous backups, and automatic maintenance. Additionally, it has a global reach, providing low latency and high performance for applications.
Learn more about AKS
03/
What are the benefits of using Azure Kubernetes Service?
AKS offers the quickest way to start developing and deploying cloud-native and AI-powered apps in Azure, datacenters, or at the edge, with built-in code-to-cloud pipelines and guardrails. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance. You only manage and maintain the agent nodes.
04/
What types of workloads can I run on AKS?
AKS supports a diverse set of containerized workloads, including monoliths and microservices, stateful and stateless, and edge and IoT use cases. You can quickly deploy packaged solutions from Microsoft partners to AKS with Kubernetes apps in the Azure Marketplace to get up and running faster.
Learn more about Kubernetes apps
05/
What deployment options are available to run AKS outside of Azure?
AKS can run in on-premises datacenters or in edge environments, such as a retail store or branch office. Azure Kubernetes Service is enabled by Azure Arc and can be deployed on Azure Stack HCI and on both Windows Server 2019 Datacenter and Windows Server 2022 Datacenter. These flexible deployment options are enabled by Azure Arc and make it quicker to get started hosting Linux and Windows containers in your datacenter or at you edge locations.
Learn more about hybrid AKS
06/
What versions of Kubernetes are supported in Azure Kubernetes Service?
AKS relies on the releases and patches from Kubernetes, an open-source project that supports a sliding window of three minor versions. The Free and Standard tiers of AKS can only guarantee full support while those versions are being serviced. AKS also provides a long-term support (LTS) version of Kubernetes for a two-year period as part of our Premium tier.
