Build your IoT application with two-way communication
Enable highly secure and reliable communication between your Internet of Things (IoT) application and the devices it manages. Azure IoT Hub provides a cloud-hosted solution back end to connect virtually any device. Extend your solution from the cloud to the edge with per-device authentication, built-in device management, and scaled provisioning.
Security-enhanced communication channel for sending and receiving data from IoT devices
Device Update for IoT Hub enables over-the-air deployment of updates to help keep IoT devices up to date and secure
Full integration with Azure Event Grid and serverless compute, simplifying IoT application development
Compatibility with Azure IoT Edge for building hybrid IoT applications
Establish bidirectional communication with billions of IoT devices
Use device-to-cloud telemetry data to understand the state of your devices and define message routes to other Azure services—without writing any code. In cloud-to-device messages, reliably send commands and notifications to your connected devices and track message delivery with acknowledgement receipts. Automatically resend device messages as needed to accommodate intermittent connectivity.
Keep IoT devices up to date with Device Update for IoT Hub
Device Update for IoT Hub is a comprehensive platform that customers can use to publish, distribute, and manage over-the-air updates for everything from tiny sensors to gateway-level devices. Explore the benefits of implementing Device Update for IoT Hub, which include being able to rapidly respond to security threats as well as deploy features to meet business objectives without incurring the additional development and maintenance costs of building your own update platforms.

Frequently asked questions about Azure IoT Hub
What are the differences between IoT Hub Basic tier, IoT Hub Standard tier, and Azure Event Hubs?
IoT Hub Basic is an ideal place to start your IoT deployment if you don’t need bidirectional communication but still want foundational IoT security with per-device authentication, highly scalable device support, and a seamless upgrade path to IoT Hub Standard. The Standard tier enables device management and Azure IoT Edge support. Event Hubs is designed for big-data scenarios such as website data ingestion. See a detailed comparison.
What are Azure quota limits and how do they affect my Azure IoT Hub subscription?
Each Azure subscription has default quota limits, which could affect the scope of your IoT solution. The current limit is 50 IoT hubs per Azure subscription. To request quota increases, please contact support. Get more details.
Which protocols does IoT Hub support?
Azure IoT Hub and IoT Hub device SDKs support the following protocols for connecting devices: HTTPSAMQPAMQP over WebSocketsMQTTMQTT over WebSockets If your application can’t use one of the supported protocols, extend IoT Hub to support custom protocols by: Using IoT Edge to create a field gateway to perform protocol translation on the edge.Customizing the Azure IoT protocol gateway to perform protocol translation in the cloud.
