Create comprehensive digital models of entire environments
Use Azure Digital Twins to gain insights that drive better products, optimize operations, and deliver breakthrough customer experiences.
Video container
Open modeling language to create custom domain models of any connected environment using Digital Twins Definition Language
Live execution environment to bring your digital twins to life in a live graph representation
Input from IoT and business systems to connect assets, including IoT devices, using Azure IoT Hub, Logic Apps, and REST APIs
Output twin change events to Azure Data Explorer, Azure Synapse Analytics, Event Hubs and other downstream services
Track the past and help predict the future of any connected environment
Easily model and create digital representations of connected environments with an open modeling language. Model buildings, factories, farms, energy networks, railways, stadiums—even entire cities. Bring these digital twins to life with a live execution environment that historizes twin changes over time. Unlock actionable insights into the behavior of modeled environments via powerful query APIs, and integrates with Azure data analytics.
Break down silos within connected environments
Model any physical environment that’s important to your business. Then connect inputs from IoT devices that are using Azure IoT Hub or from any business system to establish a single live integration layer that delivers insights from across the entire environment.
Build on a trusted enterprise-grade platform
Build enterprise-grade IoT connected solutions with the compliance, security, and privacy benefits that Microsoft Azure is known for. Monitor, manage, and update IoT devices with high-level security and scalability through integration with Azure IoT Hub. Manage access and identity with features like role-based access control (RBAC) and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
