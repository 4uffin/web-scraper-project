01/
What is Azure Functions?
Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.
You focus on the code that matters most to you, in the most productive language for you, and Azure Functions handles the rest.
Learn more
02/
How do you use Azure Functions?
Azure Functions allows you to implement your system's logic as event-driven, readily available blocks of code. These code blocks are called "functions." You write your function code in your preferred language using your favorite development tools and then deploy your code to the Azure cloud. Functions provides native support for developing in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, plus the ability to use more languages, such as Rust and Go.
Get started with Azure Functions
03/
Which programming languages does Functions support?
Functions provides varying levels of support for languages including C#, JavaScript, F#, Java, and Python.
See Supported languages in Azure Functions for details.
04/
What is the service-level agreement (SLA) for Functions?
Functions apps on the Flex Consumption plan or the App Service plan will run or be available 99.95% of the time.
See the complete SLA for Functions.
05/
What are the differences between Functions hosting plans?
Functions can run on the Flex Consumption plan, Azure App Service plan, Premium plan, or Azure Container Apps plan.
See Azure Functions scale and hosting plans for details.
06/
What services have triggers or bindings support in Functions and why should I use them?
Avoid hard-coding access to other services like Azure Blob storage and Azure Cosmos DB using triggers and bindings. Triggers are what cause a function to run, and bindings are declarations that connect the function to another resource.
See triggers and bindings Functions supports for details.
07/
How do I build and test serverless functions locally?
Create and test functions on your local machine using your favorite code editor and development tools. Connect local functions to live Azure services and debug them on your local computer using the full Functions runtime. The requirements for developing functions on your local computer depend on the programming languages and tools you prefer.
See local development environments for more.
08/
When should I use Azure Functions on Azure Container Apps?
Running Functions on Container Apps is a good fit for multitype microservices architecture in a centralized environment. This gives you consistent network, observability, and billing configurations.
