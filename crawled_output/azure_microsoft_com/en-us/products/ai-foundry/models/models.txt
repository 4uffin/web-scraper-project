What is models as a service (MaaS)?
MaaS or Serverless API is a deployment type that allows developers to access and use a variety of  models hosted on Azure without having to provision GPUs or manage back-end operations. MaaS offers inference APIs and hosted fine-tuning for models such as Meta Llama2, Meta Llama 3, Mistral Large, and others.
03/
How much does MaaS/Serverless API cost?
MaaS charges are based on the number of tokens used for inference and the amount of data used for fine-tuning. The pricing varies depending on the model and the region. To see the price for individual models, search for the model in Azure Marketplace.
04/
How can I start using MaaS?
MaaS is available in Azure Machine Learning.
05/
How many models are available today through MaaS?
Today, we have Meta’s Llama 2 and Llama 3 offerings, Mistral AI’s Mistral Large, Cohere models, Core42 JAIS, Nixtla models Stability and Deepseek models.
