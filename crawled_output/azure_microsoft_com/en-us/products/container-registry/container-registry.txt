Overview
Simplify container lifecycle management
Build, store, secure, scan, replicate, and manage container images and artifacts with a fully managed, geo-replicated instance of OCI distribution. Connect across environments, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and across Azure services like Azure App Service, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure Batch.
Store your container images and beyond
Get fast, scalable retrieval of container workloads. Azure Container Registry handles private Docker container images as well as related content formats, such as Helm charts, OCI artifacts, and images built to the OCI image format specification.
Get started with OCI artifacts
Use pipelines for development and patching
Streamline building, testing, pushing, and deploying images to Azure with Azure Container Registry Tasks. For example, extend your development inner-loop to the cloud by offloading Docker build operations to Azure with az acr build. Configure tasks to automatically rebuild application images when base images are updated, or automate image builds when your team commits code to a Git repository. Create multi-step tasks to automate building, testing, and patching multiple container images in parallel, in the cloud. Automate time-based tasks with Task Scheduling.
Learn more
Scale globally with a few clicks
Set up a single registry to serve users and hosts wherever they are, with multi-master geo-replication. Synchronize an artifact across all replicas by pushing it to any one replica. Speed up deployment by using regionalized webhooks to receive notifications when a local pull becomes available.
Learn more
Put private images on a private network
Get both the security of a private network and the robustness of a managed, geo-replicated service, using Azure Virtual Network integration and firewall rules. Restrict access to your registry to services deployed within a virtual network—for example, to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instance.
Learn more
Help safeguard content delivery with Docker Content Trust
Help ensure the content you pull from the registry is the content run on the node. Sign container images you push to the registry and configure image consumers to verify image integrity upon pulling.
Learn more
Check images with Microsoft Defender for Containers integration
Continuously scan images on Azure Container Registry. Discover known vulnerabilities in packages or other dependencies defined in the container image file. Receive vulnerability assessments and recommendations, including specific remediation guidance.
