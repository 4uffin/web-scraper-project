01/
How is Azure Compute Fleet different from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets?
Azure Compute Fleet provides the capabilities to manage even larger groups of VMs, and provides deeper levels of customization, automation, and control over VM groups across VM sizes, pricing models, and regions.
02/
What VM management capabilities are being introduced with Azure Compute Fleet?
New VM management capabilities:    Specify multiple pricing options as part of one request.   Specify desired target capacity for on-demand and Spot VMs.   Automatically replace evicted Spot VMs with any size.   Recommend combination of VM sizes to reach a target capacity, based on custom VM attributes.    Set maximum spend.   Specify on-demand and Spot fleet allocation strategies.   Increase maximum deployment size to 10,000 VMs.
03/
How can I save money with Azure Compute Fleet?
Save money with Azure Compute Fleet by selecting the most cost-efficient mix of VMs to achieve your specified workload capacity instead of having to manually select them or build custom logic. Reduce the amount of time it takes to respond to changes in capacity through various automation tools, such as when the total cost exceeds a price limit, when capacity of a certain VM size runs out, or when a spot VM is evicted.
04/
What VMs are supported?
All VM sizes and SKUs are supported by Azure Compute Fleet.
05/
How can I access Azure Compute Fleet?
Azure Compute Fleet is generally available. There's no extra charge for using Compute Fleet. You're only charged for the VMs your Compute Fleet launches per hour. For more information on virtual machine billing, see states and billing status of Azure Virtual Machines.
