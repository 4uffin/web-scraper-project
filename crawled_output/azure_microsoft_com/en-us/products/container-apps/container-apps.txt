01/
What is Azure Container Apps?
Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that allows you to maintain less infrastructure and save costs while running containerized applications. Instead of worrying about server configuration, container orchestration, and deployment details, Azure Container Apps provides all the up-to-date server resources required to keep your applications stable and secure.
Learn more
02/
What are some common uses of Azure Container Apps?
Common uses of Azure Container Apps include: Deploying API endpointsHosting background processing jobsHandling event-driven processingRunning microservices
Learn more
03/
Does Azure Container Apps support scale-to-zero pricing?
Yes, scale-to-zero is the default configuration. When the minimum instances setting is zero, you pay only when your app is active in response to events and/or requests.
04/
Does Azure Container Apps have a free tier?
Yes. Your first 180,000 vCPU per second, 360,000 GiB/s, and 2 million requests each month are free. Beyond that, you pay for what you use based on the number of vCPU per second and Gbps your applications consume.
05/
What’s the difference between active usage and idle usage?
Active usage occurs while your container is starting or while there is at least one request being processed by the application. By default, applications scale to zero. You can also configure Azure Container Apps with a minimum number of instances to always run in idle mode. Idle usage is charged at a reduced rate when the application isn't processing any requests.
06/
How can I use Azure Functions in an Azure Container Apps environment?
Azure Functions provides integrated support for developing, deploying, and managing containerized function apps on Azure Container Apps.
Learn more
07/
Why use serverless GPUs?
Serverless GPUs enable you to seamlessly run your AI workloads on-demand with automatic scaling, optimized cold start, pay-per-second billing. It has built-in data governance with scale-to-zero when not in use, and reduced operational overhead to support easy real-time custom model inferencing and other GPU related tasks. Common scenarios for serverless GPUs include real-time and batch inferencing, compute intensive machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), and data analytics.
