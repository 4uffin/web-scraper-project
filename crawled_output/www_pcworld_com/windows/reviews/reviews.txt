By Thomas Joos								5 months ago							ReviewsWindows 11's new Backup app: Everything you need to knowThe new Windows Backup app brings additional backup and synchronization functions to Windows 10 and Windows 11. We show you what the app can do and what other alternatives are available directly in Windows. 						By Thomas Joos								2 years ago							UpdatedWindows 11 2023 Update review: The rise of the AI PCMicrosoft has begun rolling out the Windows 11 2023 Update (23H2), adding Copilot and other AI-infused apps within Windows. It's a mostly positive step forward, though with definite room for improvement.						By Mark Hachman								2 years ago							ReviewsMicrosoft OneDrive review: The most affordable cloud storage, plus OfficeWith plenty of space and the best extra features, Microsoft's OneDrive cloud service is hard to beat.						By Anders Lundberg								2 years ago
ReviewsiCloud Drive review: Cloud storage for Apple usersApple's iCloud+ subscription gives you cloud storage space for iPhone backups and file synchronization.						By Anders Lundberg								2 years ago							ReviewsDropbox review: Still the best at syncing and sharingThe original in cloud sync, Dropbox, is still a great choice if fast, reliable synchronization of files and sharing with others is all you're after.						By Anders Lundberg								2 years ago							ReviewsGoogle Drive review: Solid cloud storage, but the settings can be confusingGoogle Drive is available on all major platforms, and many small ones. It has handy backup for those with Android, but the settings are difficult to understand.						By Anders Lundberg								2 years ago							ReviewsTested: Microsoft's DirectStorage signals the sunset of SATA SSDsWe test the DirectStorage performance of various SSDs and find SATA drives finally falling behind NVMe in games.						By Gordon Ung								3 years ago							UpdatedWindows 11 2022 Update (22H2) review: Subtle but weirdWindows 11 2022 Update (22H2) bold strides in accessibility, but the latest feature release of Windows 11 really doesn't address the Start menu, Taskbar, or other areas where consumers have been asking for improvement.						By Mark Hachman								3 years ago							ReviewsWindows 11 at 6 months: still playing catchupWhat's changed about Windows 11, six months in? Microsoft continues to make changes, some for the better. But there's still not enough reason to upgrade from Windows 10, and here's why.						By Mark Hachman								3 years ago							ReviewsStardock's Fences 4 keeps your desktop tidy so you don't have toStardock's utility, Fences 4, adds a "peek" feature that quickly brings up your Fences, which are regions of your Windows desktop that can organize your file icons.						By Mark Hachman								4 years ago							ReviewsWindows 11 review: An unnecessary replacement for Windows 10Windows 11 reorganizes Windows, but not to great effect. Several new features improve upon Windows 10, but technical limitations, feature delays, and some functional downgrades leave us thinking that it needs more development time to be be truly useful.						By Mark Hachman								4 years ago							UpdatedReviewed: Windows 10 October 2020 Update inches in the right directionMicrosoft's fall update to Windows 10, the Windows 10 October 2020 Update (20H2), improves the Alt+Tab functionality, makes the Start menu less attractive, and makes the new Edge browser official.						By Mark Hachman								5 years ago							ReviewsGatekeeper Two-Factor Authentication review: Needs a consumer-grade overhaulThe Gatekeeper login and 2FA system from Untethered Labs is an interesting device, but this product needs consumer-grade modifications.						By Ian Paul								5 years ago							UpdatedWindows 10 May 2020 Update review: Microsoft boosts Linux and Your Phone, but Cortana slips hardMicrosoft's Windows 10 May 2020 Update, aka Windows 10 20H1 or version 2004, pumps up Linux and the Your Phone integration to Android phones. But Microsoft also fumbles Cortana's transition to a standalone app.						By Mark Hachman								5 years ago							ReviewsMicrosoft ‘new’ Edge review: Microsoft’s Chromium-based browser gets the job doneMicrosoft's new Chromium-based Edge will show up soon on your Windows 10 PC. It performs adequately and has a few unique features, but it faces an uphill battle against Chrome.						By Mark Hachman								6 years ago							ReviewsWindows 10 November 2019 Update review: Fewer features now, bigger changes laterMicrosoft's goal with its Windows 10 November 2019 Update is to fix bugs, not push features. A Windows Search-powered File Explorer offers one of the few improvements.						By Mark Hachman								6 years ago							UpdatedWindows 10 May 2019 Update review: Sandbox and a better Windows Update improve your PCMicrosoft's latest Windows 10 May 2019 Update (aka 19H1) offers one key feature, Windows Sandbox, plus a number of minor improvements, including changes in Windows Update.						By Mark Hachman								6 years ago							UpdatedWindows 10 October 2018 Update review: Many small improvements make a better experienceMicrosoft's Windows 10 October 2018 Update includes a few nifty tricks, such as the PC-to-PC cut and paste, and the Your Phone app to grab photos from your phone. But there's more under the hood than on the surface.						By Mark Hachman								7 years ago							ReviewsAvira Antivirus Pro 2019 review: Solid performance, better pricesAvira Antivirus Pro isn't worth the price given how it doesn't differ from Avira Free, but the Avira Prime subscription with its recently lowered price makes it competitive with top suites from companies like McAfee and Symantec.
