Support for Office 2016 and 2019 ends in a few weeks. Here are your options
Once October 14th rolls around, there will be no more security updates for Office 2016 and 2019.

Microsoft wants to remind you that support for Office 2016 and 2019 will end on October 14th, the same day that support for Windows 10 ends. If this is news to you, make sure you read up on what your options are after Windows 10 hits end of life next month.
Once October 14th comes around, no more updates or security patches will be released for Office 2016 and 2019, nor will it be possible to get technical support from Microsoft, BleepingComputer reports.
To be clear, you can still keep using both Office 2016 and 2019 after support ends, but doing so comes with certain risks. Not only will you no longer have technical support if something goes wrong, but the lack of security updates means the software will become more and more vulnerable to malware and hacks over time.
If you want to keep using a supported version of Microsoft’s office suite, you’ll want to upgrade to Microsoft Office 2024. Alternative, you can subscribe to Microsoft 365 and keep using Office through that. (Learn more about picking between Office 2024 and Microsoft 365.)
For reference, support for Visio 2016 and 2019 and Microsoft Project 2016 and 2019 will also end on the same date.
