Confirmed: Windows 11’s August update can break DRM video playback
Blu-ray and DVD videos with DRM protection may stop working or crash your PC after installing update KB5064081.

It’s not uncommon for Windows updates to cause problems on your computer. Last week, there were reports that Microsoft had fixed an audio issue in Windows 11 24H2. But now the operating system appears to be having an issue with video playback instead.
In an error status confirmation, Microsoft says that Windows 11 24H2 may have problems playing copyrighted content with DRM protection in digital TV apps, Blu-ray players, and DVD players if you have August’s optional update KB5064081 installed. (The same update that added a bunch of new features and improvements.)
The updates may cause issues in video players that use a legacy component called Enhanced Video Renderer to play content with DRM or HDCP protections. For example, if you try to play a movie from your Blu-ray library on your PC, you may encounter copyright protection error messages, black screens, and the movie may freeze or pause.
As put by Microsoft:
Some Digital TV and BluRay/DVD applications might experience problems playing protected content after installing the August 29, 2025 Windows non-security preview update (KB5064081), or later updates. Applications using Enhanced Video Renderer with HDCP enforcement or Digital Rights Management (DRM) for digital audio might experience copyright protection errors, frequent playback interruptions, freezing or black screens. This issue does not impact streaming services.
Microsoft says it’s currently working to resolve the issue with future updates and will provide more information as it becomes available. Until then, affected users will likely need to use alternative DVD and/or Blu-ray playback devices or switch to streaming services.
