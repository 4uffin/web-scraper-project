Snapdragon’s new PC chips tap AirJet’s radical solid-state cooling
It's only a pair of reference designs, but that's still good news for AirJet.

Two Qualcomm reference designs, showcasing the new Snapdragon X2 Elite chips, use an AirJet cooling system from Frore Systems, representatives confirmed.
Qualcomm launched its second-generation Snapdragon X2 Elite and Elite Extreme chips at the Snapdragon Technology Summit in Maui. At press time, the company had not announced any partners for the two product families, though Qualcomm showed off two reference designs in a demonstration showcase.
Inside the two reference designs were the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Extreme chips, the company’s fastest PC processors yet. The X2 Elite Extreme includes a total of 18 cores, which can sustain 4.4GHz and boost up to 5GHz under load.

The reference designs did not include a system fan, but did use the Frore AirJet, a Qualcomm representative confirmed. It wasn’t clear which AirJet cooling chip was used, including options such as the AirJet Mini Slim.
Additionally, the Qualcomm reference designs just look cool, including a “frisbee” design and a thin mini PC that slots in under a desktop display.
Though the AirJet galvanized the industry when it was first debuted in late 2022, the company hasn’t announced any major PC design wins. It’s unclear whether Qualcomm’s reference design mandates the use of an AirJet or simply suggests it, and whether any PC maker would adopt it. Nevertheless, it’s a juicy piece of positive news for AirJet, however it turns out.
Disclosure: Qualcomm paid for my room, board, and travel expenses, but did not ask for or exert any editorial control over this story or other PCWorld content.
