Any monitor can be used for PC gaming, but a display built for productivity will likely leave you underwhelmed. Limited contrast, blurry motion, and slow refresh rates still hold basic productivity monitors back in games. Fortunately, there’s no shortage of excellent gaming monitors available at a wide range of price points—and the best of them embrace cutting-edge technology unavailable in any other PC display.
The following are the best gaming monitors we’ve tested throughout this year and last. If you want to learn more about what we look for in a good gaming monitor and how we test them, scroll further down the page.
MSI MPG 272URX – Best gaming monitor
Pros
26.5-inch 4K OLED panel looks sharp
Great contrast and color performance
Strong motion clarity
Respectable HDR performance
Lots of connectivity including USB-C
Cons
Design is a bit bland
Gamma, color temperature slightly off-target
4K OLED panel carries a premium price

Who should buy the MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED?
If you’re looking for a high-performance gaming monitor, the MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED should be at the top of your list.
This 26.5-inch display delivers stunning 4K resolution with an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate in a cutting-edge OLED panel, making it an excellent choice for gamers who want both visual clarity and fluid motion. With its 240Hz refresh rate, the MSI is built for fast-paced gaming yet maintains the deep contrast and vibrant colors OLED monitors are known for. It also supports Adaptive Sync for smooth frame pacing.
MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED: Further considerations
But wait, there’s more! The QD-OLED panel offers excellent contrast and color accuracy, which makes it a solid pick for creative professionals and anyone who enjoys watching HDR movies. Connectivity is another plus, with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1a, and USB-C inputs, as well as 98 watts of USB Power Delivery for charging laptops or tablets. While the design is a bit plain, the stand is sturdy and fully adjustable.
Priced at $1,099.99, the MSI MPG 272URX is more expensive than 1440p OLED alternatives, which can be found for under $800. But if 4K clarity and a fluid 240Hz refresh rate are what you’re after, this monitor is worth the investment.

Who should buy the Dell G2724D?
The Dell G2724D is an excellent choice if you’re looking for a budget gaming monitor that doesn’t compromise on quality. With attractive design, strong motion clarity at 165Hz, and wide Adaptive Sync support, it provides an immersive gaming experience at an affordable price.
It has a 27-inch IPS LCD panel with 1440p resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate. The color gamut spans 100 percent of sRGB, 86 percent of DCI-P3, and 82 percent of Adobe RGB, delivering a bright and vibrant image that’s excellent in games and adequate for most content creation. The monitor’s Adaptive Sync support is a standout feature, with official support for VESA Adaptive Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync.
Dell G2724D: Further considerations
This monitor also delivers a handsome design with a matte black and gray chassis and sporty rear vents that provide an aggressive yet unobtrusive look. The functional monitor stand offers a range of ergonomic adjustments and has a compact base that doesn’t consume excessive desk space.
The monitor doesn’t offer USB connectivity or 3.5mm audio-out. HDR performance is lackluster, too, making it a so-so choice for HDR gaming.
Yet it’s hard to beat the G2724D’s performance at $300 and, more importantly, it offers everything an average PC gamer is going to need for a smooth, responsive, and attractive gaming experience. It’s the kind of monitor that, despite its budget price, could have a place on your desk for several years.

Who should buy the Pixio PX248 Wave?
The Pixio PX248 Wave is a great budget monitor for gamers who want more than a no-frills display. The PX248 Wave stands apart from the budget pack with a colorful, stylish design, and solid motion performance, all available at an enticing price of $159.99.
Pixio offers the PX248 Wave in four colorways: black, white, blue, and pink. The latter two are rather special, as only a handful of monitors — like the more expensive Samsung M8 Smart Monitor — offer similarly alluring colors. The stand matches the monitor’s colorway, and Pixio even offers an optional color-coordinated monitor arm for those who want to go all-in on a particular desktop vibe.
The monitor’s 24-inch Fast IPS display boasts a 200Hz refresh rate that delivers fluid motion. Image quality is reasonable, too, as the PX248 Wave delivers respectable color accuracy and coverage, making it suitable for both gaming and casual content creation. It has built-in speakers, too.
Pixio PX248 Wave: Further considerations
Despite its visual appeal, the PX248 Wave sticks to the basics with connectivity, which includes HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4. USB connectivity isn’t available. The included stand is also basic, as it only adjusts for tilt, and the menu controls could be more user-friendly.
Most competitors at this price point have a similar display panel wrapped in a more generic black, gray, or charcoal case. Pixio’s PX248 Wave manages to match them in image quality and beat them on looks, yet it stays on a budget.

Gigabyte GS34WQC – Best budget ultrawide gaming monitor

Who should buy the Gigabyte GS34WQC?
If you’re looking for the immersive experience of a curved, ultrawide monitor at a cost that won’t leave you hurting, this is it. The Gigabyte GS34WQC checks those boxes and then some. It has a sharp 34-inch display with a resolution of 3440×1440. That’s paired with good motion clarity driven by a 120Hz refresh rate (overclockable to 135Hz) and support for AMD FreeSync, ensuring smooth and consistent gameplay. Camera movements are detailed, and fast-paced action is easily tracked.
Beyond its motion clarity, the GS34WQC delivers great image quality that’s comparable to monitors twice its price. It has a Vertical Alignment (VA) panel instead of the more common In-Plane Switching (IPS). This provides improved contrast with deeper black levels and more convincing shadow detail in dark scenes. These qualities make it especially suitable for games with a dark, gritty presentation.
Gigabyte GS34WQC: Further considerations
The monitor’s design is plain, but functional. It has an ergonomic stand that provides height and tilt adjustment, but its assembly requires manual attachment of four screws, unlike competitors with tool-free clip-in stands. The GS34WQC compensates with an intuitive menu system that has extensive customization options, allowing gamers to tailor the visuals to their preferences.
Value, however, is where the GS34WQC really beats the competition. It’s not the least expensive budget ultrawide monitor, but it delivers better image quality and motion clarity than many competitors while keeping the price in check. Indeed, the GS34WQC is so good it makes $400-to-$500-dollar ultrawide gaming monitors more difficult to recommend.

LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B – Best big-screen gaming monitor
Pros
Class-leading 5K2K resolution

Who should buy the LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B?
The LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B is the best big-screen gaming monitor for anyone who wants a premium immersive gaming experience.
The monitor’s class-leading 45-inch 5K2K (5120×2160) OLED panel helps to set the monitor apart, providing a resolution previously unseen in this size class. It’s a significant upgrade over lower-resolution predecessors, like the Corsair Xeneon Flex. The higher resolution pairs well with OLED’s excellent contrast and color performance. HDR performance is solid, with brightness comparable to other leading OLED monitors.
Motion clarity is good, as well. The monitor is a “dual mode” display, meaning it can achieve 5120×2160 at a refresh rate up to 165Hz, or 2560×1080 up to 330Hz. It also supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync for smooth gameplay.
LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B: Further considerations
The 45GX950A-B is expensive, and its aggressive 800R curve can feel “off” for productivity. The monitor also has limited USB connectivity. USB-C input is supported, but it only has two downstream USB-A ports.
But if your priority is unparalleled immersion backed by incredible sharpness and excellent HDR on a truly massive display, the LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B is a winner.

Who should buy the Asus ROG Strix XG27AQDMG?
If you’re searching for the best gaming monitor for HDR, look no further than the Asus ROG Strix XG27AQDMG. It has an LG WOLED panel that delivers stunning HDR without breaking the bank.
The XG27AQDMG’s third-generation LG WOLED panel provides exceptional HDR brightness that outperforms QD-OLED competitors and closes the gap with Mini-LED monitors. It can hit a maximum sustained brightness of 724 nits in a 10 percent window, which is enough to deliver punchy HDR highlights and detail across luminant areas of a game or movie. This pairs well with OLED’s deep, inky blacks and wide color gamut, which covers 96 percent DCI-P3 coverage. Put simply: It looks exceptionally immersive and realistic.
Gamers will appreciate the high refresh rate of up to 240Hz, which is paired with Adaptive Sync technologies like AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and Nvidia G-Sync for fluid, tear-free gaming. The refresh rate is lower than some QD-OLED competitors, which achieve up to 360Hz. On the other hand, though, the XG27AQDMG provides motion clarity far better than Mini-LED gaming monitors, such as the Red Magic 4K Gaming Monitor.
Asus ROG Strix XG27AQDMG: Further considerations
While the XG27AQDMG has strong color performance, it isn’t quite as good as QD-OLED alternatives with SDR. Sharpness is merely okay, too, and small fonts can look pixelated at times.
Pricing, however, is an upside. Sold at an MSRP of $749.99, and immediately available for just $699.99 at release, the XG27AQDMG undercuts the competition on price. Gamers who mostly stick to SDR may want to pay $50 to $100 more for a QD-OLED alternative, but the XG27AQDMG has the edge in HDR.

Who should buy the LG Ultragear 27GN950?
If you’re not a professional gamer or you just don’t require the obscenely fast 240Hz, then you can find a whole host of great options at 144Hz instead. Our pick for the best of the bunch is the LG Ultragear 27GN950.
Not only is it still super fast, but it also has 4K resolution, all of the ports your heart desires, and impressively high color fidelity. It is a great option for those who will use it for multimedia other than just gaming and don’t mind sacrificing a little speed to gain a lot of pixel density.
LG Ultragear 27GN950: Further considerations
Admittedly, it’s a bit pricey for a 27-inch monitor and you will need a high-end GPU to take advantage of its full potential, but if you can afford it, then this just might end up being the pièce de résistance in your display setup.

Who should buy the Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDP?
The Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDP is an ideal monitor for competitive gamers, as it’s the world’s first monitor to deliver a 480Hz refresh rate at 1440p resolution. This combination of motion clarity and resolution results in stunning motion performance that will give players an edge in esports and action-packed games.
Gamers will also appreciate the monitor’s excellent image quality, which enhances immersion across all genres. The WOLED panel provides excellent contrast that adds atmosphere in RPGs and horror games, while its wide color gamut, which spans 96 percent of DCI-P3, delivers a vivid and saturated look. The monitor’s good HDR brightness ensures that explosions and special effects in HDR games are displayed with convincing brightness and contrast.
Asus ROG Swift PG27AQDP: Further considerations
The PG27AQDP is packed with gamer-centric features. It supports multiple Adaptive Sync technologies, including Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync. Asus’ Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) technology further enhances motion clarity (though, unfortunately, it is only available at a 120Hz or 240Hz refresh rate). Asus also provides aspect ratio modes to contrast the display’s viewable area to that of a 24.5-inch monitor for competitive gamers, or to a 4:3 aspect ratio for older games that lack widescreen support.
It’s not perfect. The monitor lacks USB-C connectivity, which might affect some multi-device setups. Asus’ also ships the monitor with a chunky stand that won’t fit well on smaller desks. Those minor downsides aside, the PG27AQDP is an excellent monitor that will appeal to gamers who crave the best motion clarity possible.

Why should you buy the Asus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG?
The Asus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG stands out with its rare dual-mode display mode, which lets you choose between the sharpness of 4K at 165Hz or ultra-fast 1080p at 330Hz. That flexibility makes it appealing for gamers who sometimes need extreme responsiveness and motion clarity in esports titles, but also want to play games with leading-edge graphics at 4K.
The 165Hz mode is aided by Asus’ Extreme Low Motion Blur feature, which uses backlight strobing to reduce perceived blur. The 330Hz mode, meanwhile, delivers top-notch motion clarity at the expensive of reduced resolution.
Image quality is good, too. The monitor’s brightness is strong for OLED, delivering punchy SDR and HDR visuals, and its TrueBlack Glossy finish boosts perceived contrast for incredibly deep, inky blacks.
Add in a compact stand, solid connectivity with USB-C and multiple USB-A ports, as well as a competitive launch price of $899, and this monitor is an easy recommendation.
Asus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG: Further Considerations
The monitor’s TrueBlack Glossy finish is divisive. It looks vivid and contrast-rich in dark rooms but acts like a mirror in brighter rooms. Color performance, while strong, trails the top competitors in gamut coverage, and the 4K refresh rate caps at 165Hz, whereas some rivals offer 4K at 240Hz.

Other notable gaming monitors we’ve reviewed
The Alienware AW2725Q is an excellent 27-inch 4K 240Hz QD-OLED monitor, and less expensive than the competition; the BenQ PD3226G is a monitor for creative professionals, but it’s not bad in PC games, either; the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM 27-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor delivers gorgeous image quality and a long list of features, though it certainly isn’t cheap; the MSI MPG 321URXW QD-OLED is an excellent 32-inch 4K QD-OLED monitor — but with the added perk of USB connectivity; the
HP Omen Transcend 32 offers great USB-C connectivity and top-tier SDR image quality that make this 4K OLED monitor worth its high price; at less than $200, the Lenovo Legion R27fc-30 is a good budget gaming monitor with a focus on motion clarity; the Acer Predator X32 X3 is a great 4K OLED monitor that separates itself from the competition on two key points: connectivity and price; the Asus ProArt Display 5K is not the best high-resolution display on the market, but it delivers a gorgeous 5K image and long list of features at a reasonable price; the Gigabyte G34WQCP is a $350 ultrawide that earns high marks in SDR brightness, contrast, and color performance.
How we test gaming monitors
We test all monitors with a Datacolor Spyder X2 Ultra calibration tool. This tool can report objective measurements for brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, color temperature, gamma, and other metrics.
Our results are recorded and compared to the results for past monitors. Though we rely on our eyes for initial impressions, comparing objective results lets us evaluate monitors against hundreds of older models from past reviews and testing.
We examine motion clarity by quickly moving the camera across the map in Civilization VI, playing a round of Rocket League, and panning the camera across the landscape in Final Fantasy XIV—among other games. Finally, we use the popular UFO Test for an apples-to-apples comparison between displays.
In addition to gaming prowess, we consider a monitor’s on-screen menu, ergonomic stand (or lack thereof), and overall build quality—all important qualities irrespective of use case.
For more details, see our article on on how we test monitors at PCWorld.

How to choose the best gaming monitor
Gamers have unique needs that exceed an average user. Here’s what PC gamers should look for in a gaming monitor.
Resolution
Most widescreen gaming monitors have a resolution of 1920×1080 (1080p), 2560×1440 (1440p), or 4K (3840×2160). A higher resolution improves sharpness and clarity, which helps games look more detailed and lifelike. Increasing resolution also increases demand on your video card, however. Gamers with less powerful hardware may want to avoid 4K.
Refresh rate
A higher refresh leads to smoother motion by increasing the number of frames that can appear each second. It also reduces input lag, as each frame appears more quickly. A 144Hz refresh rate is a big improvement over the standard 60Hz, and 240Hz is better still. The improvement becomes more difficult to notice after 240Hz, but 360Hz monitors exist for those who want the lowest input lag possible.
DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1
DisplayPort is the best connection for PC gaming. Even DisplayPort 1.4, which is rather old, can support 4K at 144Hz. HDMI 2.1 can handle 4K at 120Hz and is an acceptable connection for PC gaming, though most gamers will use it for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S game console.
FAQ
1.
What is the best gaming monitor?
The best gaming monitor overall is the MSI MPG 341CQPX. The 34-inch panel joins a field of QD-OLED ultrawides, but stands out from the pack with better HDR, a 240Hz refresh rate, and USB-C port with 98 watts of Power Delivery.
2.
What is the best cheap gaming monitor?
At less than $300, the Dell G2724D offers incredible value for gamers. The 1440p/165Hz monitor has all the essentials: good image quality, strong motion clarity, and broad Adaptive Sync support.
3.
What resolution is best for a gaming monitor?
Many competitive gamers prefer 1080p resolution because it allows for high frame rates and low input lag even on modest hardware. This also makes it ideal for budget shoppers. 1080p is not as crisp as higher resolutions but, if it allows for higher frame rates, can look good in motion.
1440p remains a great mid-range option. It looks much sharper than 1080p but doesn’t drastically increase load on your video card. A variety of 1440p monitors now support a refresh rate up to 240Hz.
4K is the last word in sharpness and clarity. Playing a modern game on a 4K monitor takes the experience to a new level. It’s very demanding on your video card, however, so you’ll need top-tier hardware for a smooth experience.
Ultrawide monitors differ in resolution because they have a wider screen. Most ultrawide monitors have a resolution of 3440×1440, which delivers sharpness similar to a 1440p ultrawide. Some larger monitors have more exotic resolutions: the 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 Neo, for example, has 5120×1440 resolution.
4.
Should I use AMD FreeSync or Nvidia G-Sync?
AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync can synchronize the refresh rate of a compatible monitor with the output of an AMD or Nvidia video card. This ensures smooth motion and eliminates screen tearing, a distracting visual artifact.
You might be surprised to learn that most AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync monitors rely on the VESA Adaptive Sync standard. This is why many gaming monitors now support both. The difference in performance is minimal.
Our G-Sync vs. FreeSync comparison goes in-depth on their similarities and differences.
5.
Should I buy an ultrawide gaming monitor?
The short answer? Yes.
Our top choice, the Alienware AW3423DW, is an ultrawide gaming monitor. An ultrawide aspect ratio is more immersive in racing, simulation, and role-playing games. It also offers a large, more impressive perspective in many strategy games.
Not all games support an ultrawide aspect ratio, however. It’s wise to check that your favorite games support ultrawide monitors before making a purchase. Consoles rarely support ultrawide aspect ratios, so console gamers should stick with a widescreen display.
