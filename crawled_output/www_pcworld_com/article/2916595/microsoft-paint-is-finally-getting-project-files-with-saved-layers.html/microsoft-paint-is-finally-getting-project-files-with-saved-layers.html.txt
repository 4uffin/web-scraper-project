Microsoft Paint is finally getting project files with saved layers
Project files will have the .PAINT file extension and allow you to resume work at a later time.

Microsoft continues to upgrade Paint in Windows 11 with more and more advanced features, evolving it into a real tool with productive capabilities. The latest improvement is the ability to save project files, much like you can do in Photoshop or GIMP, reports The Verge.
The new project files will have a .PAINT file extension and will save layers, allowing you to easily resume your work at a later time. The feature is currently being tested in the Windows Insider Program.
The Pen and Brush tools are getting new opacity sliders that allow you to adjust transparency directly on the work surface. Paint already supports dark mode, transparency, layers, and AI image creation.
When will the new .PAINT file extension be available to all users via the stable release of Windows 11? That’s still up in the air.
