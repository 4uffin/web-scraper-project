If you’re hunting for a deal on a laptop with a touchscreen and enough power to handle just about any regular work, then head over to Best Buy pronto. You can snag a 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop with a Ryzen processor and 16GB of RAM for just $479.99. That’s over $300 off the retail price, but it’s only good for today (September 24th).
I’ve seen this exact laptop on sale at Best Buy before, but this is the best price I’ve seen for it yet. It’s packing an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U eight-core processor, which isn’t the newest out there but it’s more than capable of handling tons of web, video, and light gaming. 16GB of RAM is the base for what I recommend for Windows 11 these days, and the 1TB of storage is a nice upgrade over similar laptops in this price range. Ditto for the 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen.
With full-sized HDMI and SD card slots, this Inspiron can handle a little more than your usual mid-range laptop without needing a dongle or dock. And if you’re hunting for upgrade options, you can pop off the bottom to expose two SO-DIMM slots for DDR4 RAM upgrades and up to 2TB of storage with an affordable PCIe 3.0 SSD upgrade. The battery doesn’t inspire much confidence with just 41 watt-hours, especially with a big touchscreen, but you can’t have everything with a deal this good.
Again, Best Buy is only running this discount today, September 24th, and it ends at 1 AM Eastern US time. You can find a similar model available for less on Amazon, but you’ll need to upgrade the RAM and storage yourself to get it matching this config. If it’s not quite what you’re looking for, be sure to check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best laptops.
