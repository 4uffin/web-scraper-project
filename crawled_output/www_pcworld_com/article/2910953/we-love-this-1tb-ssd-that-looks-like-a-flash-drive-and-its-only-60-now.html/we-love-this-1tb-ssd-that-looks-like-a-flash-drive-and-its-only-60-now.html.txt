The SK Hynix Tube T31 is hands down one of the best portable SSDs we’ve tested. It’s blazing fast and has a sleek design that could easily be mistaken for a USB flash drive—what more could you want? Right now, you can snag the 1TB model for just $60 (was $84), which matches the lowest price we’ve ever seen for it.
When we reviewed the SK Hynix Tube T31, we gave it a glowing 4.5-star rating for its design and performance. It’s super compact, making it an excellent pocket-friendly option for portable SSDs. But what really wowed us was its speed, reaching up to 1,000 MB/s in our tests. That means lightning-fast file transfers!
Keep in mind that a 1TB USB flash drive would normally cost you around $80 to $100, and keep in mind that this is an SSD that’s even faster than most of those flash drive alternatives. The SK Hynix Tube T31 is widely compatible with laptops, PCs, and gaming consoles, making it a versatile choice for all your storage needs.
Our expert reviewer was so impressed that the Tube T31 became his go-to portable drive—a big endorsement considering how many SSDs we test. Its flash drive-like design makes it convenient to carry and use, setting it apart from the competition.
Grab this 1TB SK Hynix Tube T31 portable SSD for $60 while this awesome 29% discount is still around! But if it isn’t exactly the one you’re looking for, check out our roundup of the best external drives.
