Open AI’s CEO Sam Altman writes that the company is rolling out several new, computationally intensive features in the coming weeks.
Due to the high cost, some of the features will initially only be available to Pro subscribers, which costs $200 a month. In addition, some new products may come with additional fees.
“Our intention remains to drive down the cost of intelligence as aggressively as we can and make our services widely available, and we are confident we will get there over time. But we also want to learn what’s possible when we apply a lot of computational power, at today’s modelling costs, to interesting new ideas,” writes Sam Altman.
What these new features are is still unknown.
