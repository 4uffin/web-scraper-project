Google confirms plans to merge Android and ChromeOS, PCs and phones
Windows, macOS, and Linux will soon have more competition as Google plans to further develop Android for PCs and laptops.

Up until now, Google’s Android operating system has been limited to smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and smartwatches/wearables (as Wear OS). There’s also Android Auto, which is used in car infotainment systems. Android hasn’t yet been used to power laptops or desktop PCs… but that’s likely to change soon.
Rick Osterloh, Google’s SVP of Devices and Services, announced at Snapdragon Summit 2025 that Google is looking into merging Android with ChromeOS and bring its Gemini AI to PCs. The effort, known as “Project Aluminium,” will probably involve Android notebooks powered by Qualcomm processors.
Osterloh said on stage:
“In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we’re building in PCs and what we’re building in smartphones, and we’re working to combine that.
And I think that this is another way that we can leverage all of the great work we’ve been doing together on our AI stack… bring Gemini models, bringing our assistant, bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain.”
So Google wants to create a single ecosystem that combines the worlds of PCs, notebooks, smartphones, and tablets. Google has thus far developed separate operating systems for these different devices, including the aforementioned Android and ChromeOS.
Ultimately, merging ChromeOS and Android into a single operating system would mean a standardized user experience and shared platform on which mobile and desktop devices could then work together seamlessly and without interruption.
