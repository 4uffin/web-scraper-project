MicroSD cards are always useful to have on hand because you never know when you’ll need a bit of extra storage space for your devices. One of the best value microSD cards you can get right now is the Samsung Evo Select, which just so happens to be on sale today—act now and you can get the 256GB model for just $19.99 (that’s a 26 percent discount).
This tiny little card is perfect for your devices, enabling you to store more pics, vids, and all sorts of files. With data transfer speeds of up to 160 MB/s, you can easily record 4K video without worrying about lag or skipped frames. The 256GB capacity can store nearly 12 hours of 4K footage or 100,000+ photos in 4K resolution.
The Samsung Evo Select is compatible with a wide range of devices. Beyond just smartphones, you can use this card with tablets and handheld game consoles. It even comes with an SD adapter, making it more widely compatible, such as with your laptop. (Just remember that while this card will work great with the original Nintendo Switch models, it’s not compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2.)
This is a solid price for a robust 256GB microSD, so get it with this discount while you can. Need a different size? Other variants of this card are also on sale right now: the 128GB model is $12.99 and the 512GB model is $34.99.
