If you dread working on your laptop away from your home office because you can’t handle being cramped to just your laptop’s screen, then what you need is a portable monitor—like this Uperfect 2K that’s 30% off on Amazon right now. Normally $189.99, you can now grab it for just $133.58 with this hot limited-time deal! And this one’s a doozy.
For starters, it’s large at 16 inches and crisp with a glorious 2560×1600 resolution, providing plenty of screen real estate for all your apps, browser tabs, spreadsheets, and whatever else. It’s also an IPS panel, meaning vivid and accurate colors that look great whether you’re staring at documents or watching Netflix.
Other details worth noting: 400 nits of brightness to match whatever ambient environment you’re in, 120Hz of refresh for smooth responsiveness while gaming, and a smart cover that doubles as a stand so you can prop it up hands-free. It also has VESA-compatible mounting, in case you want to mount it on a monitor arm.
Yes, you can use this with your laptop, but also with a handheld like the Nintendo Switch for gaming on the go. This monitor has two USB-C video ports and a Mini HDMI port for wide compatibility across devices, including your phone, tablet, and whatever else.
The Uperfect 2K is a phenomenal portable monitor that’s a clear step up from the usual entry-level options. Get it now for 30% off while you still can because this awesome deal won’t last forever!
