If you have a Copilot+ PC, you can look forward to free AI features coming to the Notepad app in the near future. These features include AI-generated text (Write), revisions (Rewrite), and summaries (Summarize).
“Notepad now supports AI features like Summarize, Write, and Rewrite on Copilot+ PCs, with no subscription required. If you have a subscription, you can seamlessly switch between local and cloud models based on your needs,” said Dave Grochocki, Principal Group Product Manager for Windows Inbox Apps, in a Windows Insider blog post.
“If you’re not signed in or don’t have a subscription, you can use the local model to accomplish your tasks. For now, these features support English only, making premium AI more accessible and flexible for everyone.”
To clarify, these AI-driven features were previously only offered to customers who pay for Microsoft 365 or Copilot Pro, but now they’re being rolled out to more users for free.
