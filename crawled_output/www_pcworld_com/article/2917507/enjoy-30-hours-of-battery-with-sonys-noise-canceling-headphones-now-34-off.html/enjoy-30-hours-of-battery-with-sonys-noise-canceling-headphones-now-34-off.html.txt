Life can be hectic, but a good pair of headphones can help you block out the noise. The fantastic Sony WH-1000XM4 delivers impeccable noise-canceling and superb sound while jamming out to your favorite music, listening to audiobooks, or enjoying your favorite podcasts. They’re now 34 percent off at Amazon, bringing the price down to $228.
These are some of the best wireless headphones you can get right now. few years ago, our friends at Tech Advisor gave them a perfect five-star rating (a rare honor!) and awarded them with the prestigious Editors’ Choice award. They found the headphones deliver fantastic noise cancelation, sound great, and are super light and comfortable. Basically, they check all the boxes.
The headphones also have a battery that lasts around 30 hours, and a quick 10-minute recharge can give you five more hours of playback. The earcups have touch sensors for media and volume control, so you’ll need to get used to using them.
We know there are newer (and better) models of these headphones, but they rarely go on sale and are much more expensive. So snag the excellent Sony WH1000XM4 for $228 while the deal lasts.
