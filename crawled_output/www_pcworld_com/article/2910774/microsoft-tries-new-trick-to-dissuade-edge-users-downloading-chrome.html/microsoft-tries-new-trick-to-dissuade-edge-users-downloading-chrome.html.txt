Microsoft tries new trick to dissuade Edge users downloading Chrome
When searching for Chrome in Bing Search, you'll be shown a comparison of Edge versus Chrome.

If you end up searching for Chrome in Bing Search with Microsoft Edge, you might start seeing a new advertisement that says “All you need is right here,” reports Windows Latest.
The advertisement includes a table that compares features between Chrome and Edge and tries to sell you on the browser by saying “Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.” You’ll also spot quick links to apps like YouTube, Facebook, Gmail, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Netflix.
It’s no secret that Microsoft really, really wants users to stick with Edge and will do anything it can to deter users from switching to Chrome. In the past, Microsoft injected an awkward poll when downloading Chrome via Edge, and earlier this year hid the Chrome download link in Edge. Meanwhile, Microsoft is testing new ways to convert Chrome users.
To be fair, Edge has been improving. In addition to getting various AI features, Edge has gotten much faster and will continue to be supported even after Windows 10’s end of life. But tacky tactics like this are sure to turn off anyone who’s still on the fence, and there aren’t many left.
