Our pets deserve the very best and we deserve the peace of mind of knowing they’re safe and fed even when we’re not home. Thankfully, there’s plenty of tech out there to keep both us and our fur babies happy. From cameras to automated feeders, let’s see some of the best pet tech out there.
TP-Link TAPO 2K Pan/Tilt Camera
TP-Link Tapo
Listen, there are tons of options you can get for “pet cams” — some more expensive, some cheaper, some with subscriptions — it can be hard to know what’s best. In our opinion, TP-Link Tapo cam gives you everything you need without any of the hassles. Not only does it pan and tilt, but it can detect motion, gives you access to two-way audio so you can scold your dog for getting on the couch, and so on. It comes with an SD card storage option and it’s super easy to integrate with Alexa and Google Home. Plus, you can get a two-pack of these for $44, although it often goes on sale.

Petlibro Automatic Cat Feeder
Petlibro
You could continue being awakened at 5AM by your gremlin of a cat meowing in your face, or you could luxuriate in more sleep while an automatic pet feeder tends to Kitty’s needs. This is also a handy solution for short trips as you can be assured your cat will be fed on schedule. The Petlibro feeder comes with an HD camera with night vision so you can check in on your fluffer, and even chat with them. Yes, yes, it also works with dogs, but let’s face it — they’re not usually as demanding.

Petkit Eversweet Max Water Fountain
Petkit
Your pets don’t just need food, but also fresh water, so getting them a cordless water fountain takes care of that. The Max water fountain comes with a high-capacity battery so you only need to recharge it every couple of months or so. There’s a motion sensor that triggers the water to flow, but there are multiple modes you can choose from in the companion app. That same app will even tell you how often your pets drink water, which can be useful info for your vet.

PetSafe ScoopFree Crystal Pro Automatic Litter Box
PetSafe
Sure, there are about a million automatic litter boxes these days, and many of them are super expensive. Plenty of people swear by this PetSafe model, however, which is only $160 when on sale. This self-cleaning litter box will sense when your cat is done and push the crystallized clumps or other, more smelly droppings in a special compartment so it’s easier to clean. The maker says it can last up to a month if you only have one cat.

Smart Dog Tracker Collar
Fi
The Fi Series 3+ smart dog tracker collar will make it easy to always know where your dog is or if Fido leaves your yard for any reason. The purchase comes with a six-month membership included. You’ll not only know your dog’s location, but also duration of sleep time, number of steps taken, and more. The collar is waterproof, so there’s no need to remove it for romps in the water.

Android or iOS tracking alternatives
SkyArmor
It’s important to be able to track your pets at all times, so here are some alternative options for that task. You could get either an Apple AirTag or a Samsung SmartTag2 and add it to your pup’s collar. This particular tracker holder slips onto any collar and fits your SmartTag 2, while a similar one works the same for an AirTag. Both are super affordable and are solid options, although they will need to ping off either an Apple or Samsung phone to work, lacking the GPS localization of previous models.

Furbo 360
Furbo
Furbo has some cool things ready for your pets, too. Whether you have a cat or a dog, you can get a dedicated treat dispenser. Not only does this thing throw your pet treats when you’re away, but it also films them and lets you communicate with them. So, if you’re at work and want to check in with your fur babies, you can call their names and throw them a treat through the app. Just hope your pet isn’t smart enough to kill this toy just to get some extra treats. These are available for both dogs and cats (the cat one comes with a cute toy on top, too).
