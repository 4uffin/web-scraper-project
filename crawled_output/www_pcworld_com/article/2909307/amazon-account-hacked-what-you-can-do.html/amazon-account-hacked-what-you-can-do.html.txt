Amazon account hacked? Here’s what to do
Getting locked out of your Amazon account or seeing strange orders can be scary. Here’s how to take back control and keep it safe.

Few other companies are as present in everyday life as Amazon. This makes it all the more shocking when suddenly the login no longer works, strange orders appear or the account is even blocked. In this guide, we show you how to proceed step by step in an emergency and how to better protect your account in future.
Hacked Amazon account: What to do right away
Case 1: When Amazon blocks your account
If Amazon detects unusual payment activity, it will (usually) block it automatically. This can include orders that don’t match your typical behavior or multiple failed payment attempts. The block is a protective measure meant to prevent further misuse of your account.
Here’s what you can do to regain access:
Check your email inbox as well as your SMS messages. In the event of a block, Amazon will send you an email with the subject line “Account Blocked,” with instructions for next steps.
Log in to your Amazon account with your access data. It’s usually still possible to log in even if your account is blocked.
After logging in, Amazon will take you to a form where you’ll need to confirm your identity. Complete all the required fields and upload all requested documents (such as a copy of your ID or a bank statement).
In most cases, you’ll receive additional e-mails or text messages from Amazon indicating open orders or pending checks. Follow these instructions carefully to avoid delays.
Important: While your account is suspended, you will not have access to Amazon’s services.
Case 2: Suspicious activity, but the account is still active
Sometimes users themselves notice suspicious activity even though the account is not yet officially blocked. In this case, you can start the verification process on your own by logging into your Amazon account and clicking on “Start” under My Account → Login & Security → Compromised Account?.
In My Account > Login & Security, you can take the first steps if you suspect your Amazon account has been compromised.IDG / Ashley Biancuzzo
Signs of a hacked Amazon account
An attack isn’t always easily recognizable. Here are the warning signs:
Login no longer works, password allegedly incorrect
Unknown orders or cancelations appear in your history
New delivery addresses or payment methods that don’t come from you
Gift card or credit amounts disappear
Amazon informs you of suspicious activity
How to keep your Amazon account secure
A strong password is essential. Make sure yours is unique to Amazon, long and complex, and includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Repeated or easy-to-guess passwords are easy targets for hackers.
If you’re not a fan of passwords, you can use a passkey instead. This modern login method replaces traditional passwords with a cryptographic key pair and is much harder to crack. It can be activated directly in the account settings under Login & Security, and it works across all platforms on devices that support passkeys.
You should also turn on two-factor authentication. When logging in, you’ll need to enter a second code in addition to your password, which you’ll receive by text message or through an authenticator app. Even if criminals know your password, access remains blocked without this second factor. You can also find this security measure under Login & Security in your account settings.
Also, be careful with links. Only log in through the official Amazon website or the app, never through links in emails or text messages. Many phishing attacks are aimed precisely at making fake login pages appear genuine.
And finally: browse safely. Avoid logging in to public Wi-Fi networks when you’re at the café or airport. If you can’t avoid it, use a VPN that encrypts your data, which minimizes the risk of hackers getting access to your information.
