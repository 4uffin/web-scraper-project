If you’re looking for an affordable Windows machine under $500, a blazing fast gaming beast for those intense matches, or a portable 2-in-1 for school or work, you’ve got plenty of great choices right now. We’ve hunted deals from Amazon, Best Buy, and beyond—so you don’t have to.
Want to see even more? Take a peek at PCWorld’s list of the top laptops you can get right now.
Why you should trust us: It’s in our name! PCWorld prides itself on laptop experience and expertise. We’ve been covering PCs since 1983, and we now review more than 70 laptops every year. All of the picks below have been personally tested and vetted by our experts, who’ve applied not only performance benchmarks but rigorous usability standards. We’re also committed to reviewing PC laptops at every price point to help you find a machine that matches your budget.
Best budget laptop deals under $500
Dell
Our top pick: Dell Inspiron 15, $419.99 ($210 off at Best Buy)
If you want the most bang for your buck, the Dell Inspiron’s hard to beat. It’s rocking an Intel Core i5-1334U, which handles work, streaming, and a bunch of tabs pretty well. You’ve also got 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, so it’s not crazy fast, but it gets the job done. The 15.6-inch 1920×1080 touchscreen is nice for extra space, and at $419.99 ($210 off at Best Buy), it’s basically a solid deal that should last a bit.

Best mid-range laptop deals ($500-$900)
HP
Our top pick: HP OmniBook X Flip, $799.99 ($200 off at Amazon)
If you want a laptop that feels way nicer than what you’re paying, the HP OmniBook X Flip on Amazon is the one to grab. It’s $849.99 right now (down a wild $650), and you’re getting a big 16-inch 1200p screen, a snappy new Ryzen AI 5 chip, plus 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Translation: You’re getting plenty of power and you don’t have to worry about running out of space. Since it’s a 2-in-1, you can flip it around for tablet mode too, which is just a bonus at this price.

Best gaming laptop deals
Gigabyte
Our top pick: Gigabyte Gaming A16, $1,099.99 ($200 off at Best Buy)
If you want to breeze past the awkward medium-settings stage, the Gigabyte Gaming A16’s got your back. It’s packing an Intel Core i7-13620H CPU and an RTX 5060 GPU, so high settings in modern games are pretty much a given. The 16-inch 1920×1200 screen gives you a bit more breathing room than the usual 1080p, and with 32GB of RAM, you can have a game, a dozen browser tabs, and Discord all running at once. Plus, the 1TB SSD means you can keep your library installed instead of constantly playing “which game do I uninstall next?” in the wee hours of the night.

Best premium laptop deals ($900+)
MSI
Our top pick: MSI Summit A16 AI+, $1,099.99 ($600 off at Newegg)
Out of all the Newegg deals listed below, the MSI Prestige A16 AI+ feels like the best one–I’ll tell you why. It’s the same price as the Summit model ($1,099.99), but you’re getting a sharper 3840×2400 display instead of the lower resolution (2560×1600) one. That’s a pretty solid screen upgrade for no extra cost. And since both have the same processor, RAM, and storage, so why not grab the one with the better screen for the same price?

FAQ
1.
How much RAM will I need in my laptop?
You’ll want at least 8GB, though 16GB is preferable, especially if you play games. Don’t buy laptops with under 4GB of RAM or 128GB of SSD storage—though on a Chromebook or a budget Windows machine, this configuration is acceptable. Check out our article on how much RAM does a laptop need for more in-depth info.
2.
What’s the difference between a Chromebook and a Windows laptop?
The one big difference between a Chromebook and a Windows laptop is the operating system. Chromebooks run ChromeOS and Windows run, well, Microsoft Windows.
Chromebooks make good everyday machines because they’re designed for browsing the web, checking e-mail, and so on. They use less resources and are generally more affordable than the Windows variety. They also don’t need antivirus protection. A Windows laptop is a lot more versatile in what it can do, and not just in terms of running local programs. You can really pump a Windows laptop up with a ton of RAM, storage, and so on.
3.
When should I look for a laptop deal?
You’ll likely find the best laptop deals during Prime Day (mid-July), Black Friday (the day after Thanksgiving), and back-to-school season (June-August). Sure, you’ll find good laptop deals throughout the year, but if you really want to save big, we’d recommend scoping out your favorite online retailers during those times.
4.
Which retailers offer the best deals?
You can find all kinds of deals across a wide range of online retailers such as Newegg, Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, and so on. However, we’d recommend checking out deals from laptop manufacturers like Lenovo, HP, and Dell. You’ll usually find many different configurations on sale and the discounts can be pretty darn steep.
