Steam will officially drop support for 32-bit Windows after this year
The PC gaming platform will soon only be supported on 64-bit versions of the operating system.

Valve recently announced that Steam will stop supporting 32-bit versions of Windows as of January 1st, 2026.
Right now, Windows 10 32-bit is the only 32-bit version of Windows that officially works with Steam—and according to the company’s own hardware survey, it’s used by less than 0.01 percent of Steam gamers.
Meanwhile, all 64-bit versions of Windows (including Windows 10 64-bit) will continue to be supported and can keep playing 32-bit games.
For users still on Windows 10 32-bit, this will mean that the installed Steam client will continue to work as-is but without any updates, security fixes, or technical support. Valve also emphasizes that it can’t guarantee that functionality will continue on unsupported systems.
According to the company, this move is necessary because basic components of Steam require drivers and libraries that are no longer supported in 32-bit environments.
