If your laptop is like mine, it’s lacking a bunch of useful ports. Once you plug in the charger, you probably don’t have much connectivity left—especially if your charger plugs into USB-C. And what if you want to connect an external monitor or two but don’t have any HDMI ports? Yeah, it sucks that ports are disappearing on modern laptops.
But no worries because you can solve this with a simple accessory like this Anker 7-in-1 USB-C hub that’s now just $17.99 (was $24.99) on Amazon with a smooth 28 percent discount. With this nifty gadget, you can expand your laptop’s potential by quite a bit.
Acer’s USB-C hub features a USB-C port with 100W of power delivery, allowing you to keep charging your laptop even while this hub is plugged in. Then, while charging, this hub also provides a separate USB-C data port, two USB-A ports, both SD and microSD card slots, and an HDMI port that supports a monitor up to 4K at 30Hz. It’s the ultimate accessory for turning a laptop into a proper workstation.
Grab this Acer USB-C hub for just $17.99 while you still can because this limited-time deal won’t last forever! This matches the lowest price it’s ever been, so now’s as good a time as ever.
