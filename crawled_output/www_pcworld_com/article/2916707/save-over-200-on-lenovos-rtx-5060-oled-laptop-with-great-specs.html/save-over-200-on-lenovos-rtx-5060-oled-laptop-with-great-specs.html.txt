If you’re going to get a gaming laptop, why hold back on a budget model when you could spring for an upper-mid-range option with the latest Nvidia features that’ll serve you well for years to come? And if you act now, you can get one without sacrificing an arm and a leg for it. I’m talking about this Lenovo Legion Pro 5 that’s now on sale for $1,449.99 at Best Buy with a snazzy $210 discount.
This is a fantastic config that starts with an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HX CPU, bulks up with a whopping 32GB of DDR5 memory, and rounds out with a fast 1TB SSD. That translates into a speedy machine that can handle all your tasks from work to play, and I haven’t even mentioned the kicker yet: a Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU that unlocks all the latest Nvidia features like DLSS 4 and more. In a nutshell, the best of modern gaming.
It’s a looker too, complete with a vivid 16-inch OLED screen that sports a crisp 2560×1600 resolution, a 165Hz refresh rate, and a solid 500 nits of brightness. This is a device that’s as gorgeous while watching Netflix as it is while playing games, and it’ll smoothly display those frames without any tearing or skipping. As for ports? You get HDMI, two USB-C video (one with power delivery), three fast USB-A for data, LAN, 3.5mm audio, and a dedicated power connector.
Getting an RTX 5060 laptop with specs like this at this price point is a bargain through and through, so get the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 for $1,449.99 while this deal is still available!
