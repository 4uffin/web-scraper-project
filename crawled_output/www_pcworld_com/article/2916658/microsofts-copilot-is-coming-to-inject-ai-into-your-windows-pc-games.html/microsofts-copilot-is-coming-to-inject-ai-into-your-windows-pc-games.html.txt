Microsoft’s Copilot is coming to inject AI into your Windows PC games
Microsoft demands AI in everything, even AI that watches you play video games.

Microsoft will not stop until every last part of your PC experience is full to bursting with “artificial intelligence.” Notepad has AI in it now. Need I say more? Well, I guess I need to, since this article is about PC games. To wit, Gaming Copilot is now rolling out to users via Windows 11’s Game Bar.
Gaming Copilot is still in beta, according to the announcement post, but it’s now rolling out integration into the Game Bar system everywhere except mainland China. Previously exclusive to the Xbox Insider Program (which is not the same as Windows Insider), the tool can “see” your gameplay and offer relevant tips and tricks. You can even converse with it in Voice Mode with a dedicated push-to-talk button, or give it something specific with a screenshot. With integration into the Xbox platform, you can ask it about your past achievements or play history.
Oddly, the AI-enhanced tool will only be available to “players aged 18 and older.” I wonder if some Microsoft lawyers are looking at the issues its AI partner OpenAI is having with adolescents at the moment and deciding that they don’t want the headache, especially in the famously contentious world of online multiplayer games. The capabilities will be expanding to the Xbox mobile app in October.
