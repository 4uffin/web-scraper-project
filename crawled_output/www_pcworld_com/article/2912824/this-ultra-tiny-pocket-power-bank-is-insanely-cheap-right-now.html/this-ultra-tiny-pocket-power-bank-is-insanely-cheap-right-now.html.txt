I love knowing I can recharge my phone anywhere at any time thanks to the power bank I’m always carrying—it makes me less anxious about leaving home without a full charge. If you don’t have a power bank yet, or if you want another as backup, here’s an excellent one to consider: Iniu’s ultra-compact pocket power bank is only $18.14 right now, a whopping 53 percent off its original $38.99.
With its 10,000mAh capacity, this tiny power bank has enough to recharge most phones two times over, and its 45W output ensures fast charging so you’ll quickly go from the dreaded red battery warning to a healthy green. There are three ports available on this power bank—two USB-C ports and one USB-A—so you can charge 3 devices at once.
How small is this thing exactly? Well, it’s slightly larger than the charging case of your AirPods Pro. More technically, it’s about 3.3 inches tall, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick. It’s also super light, weighing some 5.6 ounces. That means it’s super easy to carry around and shove into your pocket when you don’t need it. It even has a built-in lanyard that doubles as a short USB-C cable you can use for charging!
What are you even waiting for? This is an insanely cute and practical gadget that’s also wonderful as a gift. Get it now for just $18.14 while you can because this magnificent deal won’t last forever!
