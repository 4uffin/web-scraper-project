When it comes to securely storing or transferring your files, a physical drive is still one of the best options because—unlike cloud storage—you only pay for it once and you don’t have to rely on a stable and fast internet connection. That’s why the 256GB Samsung Type-C USB Flash Drive is one of our favorites to keep on hand, and doubly so now that it’s down to $26.99 (was $32.99) on Amazon.
Sure, 256GB might not be a ton of space, but it’s plenty for everyday file transfers from device to device, whether we’re talking about 4K movies, massive photo collections, portable apps, and more.
Samsung’s USB-C drive is also speedy, with data transfer rates up to 400 MB/s, which means it takes less than 5 minutes to move an enormous 100GB folder. If you remember the days of Napster and LimeWire and still have nightmares about how long it took to download one MP3, then you’ll seriously appreciate what this thumb drive can do.
This flash drive is also good to resist anything and everything with its rugged design, with it being protected against drops, water, dust, magnets, X-rays, and even extreme temperatures.
It’s a great USB-C drive that you can rely on, and it’s worth the price because fast and reliable USB-C drives aren’t too common. Get the Samsung Type-C USB Flash Drive for $26.99 while you can!
This fast and robust USB-C flash drive is a great pick for $27Buy now at Amazon
