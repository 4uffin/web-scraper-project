Logitech’s new solar wireless keyboard is out for a hundred bucks
The Signature Slim Solar+ K980 can recharge from artificial light and last for 4 months in darkness.

Logitech would like to show off its new solar-powered wireless keyboard, and I would like to apologize for spoiling it a few weeks ago. But if you were itching to get your hands on a new wireless keyboard that never needs its batteries replaced, now you can! Logitech’s Signature Slim Solar+ K980 is now available for $100.
With a full-width format (number pad on the right), a low-profile build, and a black-on-gray color scheme, the Signature Slim Solar+ takes a lot of design cues from Logitech’s MX series, but the strip of solar cells at the top is much more elegantly integrated into the design than on some of Logitech’s previous attempts.
According to the promotional page, the solar cell can recharge the battery via natural or artificial light, saving the charge for up to 4 months and lasting up to 10 years. If the interior battery does stop charging, it can be replaced, according to the FAQ.
All that said, I can’t help but find this offering a little underwhelming. Logitech was selling solar-recharging wireless keyboards with backlighting over a decade ago. Unless you really want the multi-device pairing and Logi Options+ compatibility that have become standard, or you’re just itching for a dedicated “AI Launch” key, I’m not seeing a ton of improvement over the K750 from way back in 2011.
