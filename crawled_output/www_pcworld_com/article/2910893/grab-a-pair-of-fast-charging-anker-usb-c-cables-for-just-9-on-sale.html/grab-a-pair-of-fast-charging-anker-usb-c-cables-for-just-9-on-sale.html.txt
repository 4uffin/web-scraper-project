Be honest: how many good USB cables do you have? You know, ones that didn’t come with your phone or earbuds from years ago, and ones that haven’t been bent out of shape or torn apart by your cat. If you want to truly fast charge your devices, you might want to step up your cables—and right now, you can get this 2-pack of 100W Anker USB-C cables for $9 on Amazon with a crazy 44% discount.
These are 100W USB-C cables, meaning they’ll fast charge your devices as long as you have a charging block, wall plug, or power bank that’s capable of pushing that much power. It’s perfect for your smartphone, tablet, earbuds, and even some laptop models.
These cables are braided nylon, which means they’ll resist lots of twists and bends, getting shoved into a bag pocket, and so on. They’re also long at 6 feet in length, so you can keep using your phone comfortably in bed without being tethered to the wall.
A pair of these fast USB-C cables usually costs $16, but you can get them for a mere $9 right now. Don’t pass up this chance!
