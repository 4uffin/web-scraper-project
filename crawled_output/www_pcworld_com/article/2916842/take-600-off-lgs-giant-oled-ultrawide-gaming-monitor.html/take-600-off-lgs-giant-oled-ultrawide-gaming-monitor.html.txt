If you want to go big on gaming monitors, that means you need to spend big. But even if you have a high budget, it still pays to hunt for deals. For example, you can get an oversized 39-inch ultrawide OLED from LG for just $896.99 from Amazon. That’s over $600 off the retail price.
The LG Ultragear 39GX90SA-W is a deluxe, upgraded version of the ultrawide format, keeping the semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution but stretching to an even bigger 39 inches and adding LG’s WebOS smart TV software. PCWorld’s monitor expert Matt Smith said it’s a good-looking monitor with great image quality and extra features in his review. And with a refresh rate of 240Hz and support for both FreeSync and G-Sync, it’s more than ready to take your desktop gaming to the next level.
Other goodies inside this screen include plenty of ports, including USB-C with 65 watts of charging. That makes it a great companion to laptops, though the biggest and most powerful gaming models might feel a little thirsty. Excellent support for consoles makes it a great companion for other gadgets at your desk, but with built-in Wi-Fi and its own streaming apps, it can handle plenty of media all by itself. Just make sure to plug in some decent speakers, the ones inside the panel aren’t great.
You can use your discount to add on a VESA monitor arm, just make sure to get one that can handle this oversized screen’s 16.1-pound (7.3 kilograms) weight. This is a great sale, but there’s no indication of when it’ll end on Amazon’s storefront. And yeah, almost a grand is still a lot to spend on a monitor even if you can afford it. If you’re looking for something cheaper, check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best monitors.
