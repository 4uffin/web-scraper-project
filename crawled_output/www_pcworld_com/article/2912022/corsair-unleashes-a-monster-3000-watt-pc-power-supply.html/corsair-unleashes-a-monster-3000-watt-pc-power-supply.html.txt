Corsair unleashes a monster 3,000-watt PC power supply
The WS3000 has enough juice to run four of the latest, most enormous graphics cards at once.

The last few PCs I built topped out at 850 watts… and I thought that was pretty beefy. If you’re aiming for something over a kilowatt, most standard desktop users would call that a monster. But Corsair’s newest PSU scoffs at such paltry power. The new WS3000 power supply outputs 3,000 watts! As far as I know, that’s a new record for anything that fits in a standard ATX case.
The Corsair WS3000 is fully modular, with no less than six 8-pin PCIe rails for the CPU and four of the latest 12v-2×6 rails for graphics cards at up to PCIe 5.1 and ATX 3.1 standards. That is a ton of power and tech, though the spec sheet says it’s 175mm long and tastefully omits a weight rating. The 140mm internal fan uses double ball bearings, though it’s decidedly not silent, and has no iCue support (that’s Corsair’s semi-proprietary lighting system). No RGB light shows in this thing? Oh my, Corsair, you’re singing my song!

The promotional material says that the WS3000 is for “system integrators and creative pros building heavy compute boxes: multi‑GPU rendering nodes, AI/ML training rigs, and high‑resolution post‑production workstations.” So yeah, if you want to cram an entire Pixar render farm inside a single case, or more realistically a massive rig for running enough AI models to melt a toaster, this is the power supply for you.
You’ll need one more thing to get your hands on it—or, more accurately, six hundred more things. $600 USD is what I’m saying here, though Tom’s Hardware found a retail listing for less than that already. All things considered, that’s not entirely unreasonable for so much over-the-top, specialized hardware.
