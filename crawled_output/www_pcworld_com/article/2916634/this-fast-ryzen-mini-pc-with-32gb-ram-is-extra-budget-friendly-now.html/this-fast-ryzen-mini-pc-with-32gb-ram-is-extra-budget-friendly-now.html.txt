For most home office PC setups, the best computing option these days isn’t a bulky desktop or an expensive laptop but rather a mini PC. These things are compact, performant, and darn affordable, delivering great performance at a great price while taking up minimal space.
One standout option for anyone on a tight budget is the Kamrui E3B mini PC, currently discounted down to just $278 (from its original $400) on Amazon. This mini PC is super compact and easily fits under your monitor or can be mounted to the back of a VESA-compatible monitor.
Despite its size and economical price, it’s still pretty powerful with an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U CPU and a hefty 32GB of RAM. That’s more than capable of running Windows smoothly while also handling multiple apps and juggling all your open browser tabs. It also comes with a 512GB SSD, which isn’t huge but should be adequate if you aren’t hoarding tons of video or installing too many enormous apps. (Need to go bigger? It’s user-upgradeable up to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of storage!)
Connectivity isn’t something you’ll have to worry about with the Kamrui E3B either, featuring a slew of ports that include six super-fast USB-A data ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, a 3.5mm audio jack, as well as triple 4K@60Hz support with HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C video connections. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 are built in, too.
Overall, the Kamrui E3B is a fantastic choice for budget-conscious home office setups that want good performance without any bells and whistles. Get it now for $278 while this deal is still going on!
