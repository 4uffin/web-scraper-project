Logitech brings adjustable actuation to its gaming keyboards and mice
The new and pricey Pro X2 Superstrike mouse and G515 Rapid Trigger keyboard both feature analog switches.

Adjustable actuation is what lets you choose a custom “trigger” point for each key, and it’s the buzziest feature in gaming keyboards. Logitech is hopping on the train now, even if it had to do a lot of jogging to catch up. The newest version of the G515 keyboard, now with magnetic switches, is christened the Rapid TKL—and it’s shipping now for $170. Ouch.
The G515 Rapid TKL looks a whole lot like the existing G515 designs, with a distinctive low-profile tenkeyless layout that’s just 22mm tall. Each one of those “analog” switches can be adjusted at 0.1mm increments in the travel (down to 2.5mm total), including “rapid trigger” capabilities, a feature that many competitive gamers want. (Razer calls it “snap tap,” if you’ve heard that one.) Two different functions can be bound to each key at different actuation points.

Other features include keycaps made out of premium PBT keycaps (“Nice,” says my inner keyboard nut), a steel top plate, and a complete lack of wireless. That might feel like a step backwards for a top-of-the-line design, but adjustable actuation switches can drink down a lot of battery power. Even so, it’s an omission that hurts with a keyboard this expensive.

Logitech also announced new gaming mice. The Pro X2 Superstrike features a “haptic inductive trigger system,” which Logitech says is a combination of adjustable actuation in the mouse switch and rapid trigger capabilities. That’s a lot of buzzwords, but the technology underneath uses copper coils to generate an electromagnetic field with a 0.6mm switch that can be user-adjusted at 10 different points, including rapid trigger reset.

What does that mean for PC gamers? In addition to adjustable actuation points on a mouse—which seems like something that’s almost impossible to feel to me, but I haven’t gotten this thing in hand—Logitech says that the mouse can reduce click latency by “9 to 30ms.”
Other highlights for the wireless, shooter-style mouse include Logitech’s 44,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor, 90 hours of battery life, and 8,000Hz polling. The mouse is 60 grams, impressively light for all that tech. Be prepared to pay for it. The Pro X2 Superstrike mouse will cost a hefty $180 when it launches in the first quarter of 2026.
