Want to try the next Windows 11 version? It’s now available to download
WIndows 11 25H2 is the next major version of Microsoft's operating system. The ISO file for it is now available to everyone as a free download.

Microsoft has uploaded the ISO files for Windows 11 25H2, the next major version of Windows 11. The so-called “enablement package” is also available, which lets you directly upgrade from Windows 11 24H2 to Windows 11 25H2 without needing the ISO file.
ISO files for Windows 11 25H2 are available for x64 (Intel and AMD PCs) and Arm64 (Snapdragon PCs) architectures as well as Home, Pro, and Education Editions in 38 languages.
Windows 11 version 25H2 RTM ISOs have now been uploaded to Microsoft's servers. Download them here in x64 or Arm64 flavors https://t.co/PoCqjWgyL1— Windows Central (@WindowsCentral) September 22, 2025
According to Windows Central, this is the RTM (Released To Manufacturing) ISO, which means this is the official version of Windows 11 25H2 that Microsoft will be sending to PC manufacturers. However, Microsoft no longer officially uses the term RTM.
The build number of the Windows 11 25H2 RTM ISO is apparently Build 26200.6584. The ISO download is on average about 7GB for x64, while the ISO for Arm64 is a few hundred MB smaller.
The ISO file is available directly via Microsoft. Windows Central has linked all the individual ISO downloads for every architecture and language, so head there and click on the ISO file suitable for your PC.
Do you need the Windows 11 25H2 ISO?
You can use the ISO file to completely reinstall Windows 11 and bring it up to version Windows 11 25H2, meaning this is a great way to upgrade any PC that still runs on Windows 11 24H2 or 23H2.
However, the leaner enablement package is recommended for PCs running Windows 11 24H2 since the download is smaller and the upgrade time is faster. Enablement packages for x64 and Arm64 can be acquired using the following Microsoft links:
Enablement package (KB5054156) for x64 PCs
Enablement package (KB5054156) for Arm64 PCs
Despite all the above, Microsoft has not yet officially released Windows 11 25H2. As soon as it’s official, though, users on Windows 11 24H2 PCs will be offered the enablement package via Windows Update. You can then use that to cleanly and effortlessly upgrade to 25H2.
Learn more about all the exciting new features in Windows 11 25H2, such as the new-look Start menu and its big upgrades.
