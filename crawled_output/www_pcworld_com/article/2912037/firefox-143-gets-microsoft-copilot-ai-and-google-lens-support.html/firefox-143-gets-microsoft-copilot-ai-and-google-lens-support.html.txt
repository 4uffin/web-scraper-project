Firefox 143 gets Microsoft Copilot AI and Google Lens support
The newest version of Firefox comes with new AI features and accessibility improvements, plus fixes to numerous security vulnerabilities.

The latest update to Firefox brings the browser up to version 143 with various new features and improvements, including some that other browsers already offer. However, some of these features—like Google Lens—are only being introduced gradually. The update also fixes some security vulnerabilities as usual.
Mozilla plans to release Firefox 144 on October 14th, 2025.
What’s new in Firefox 143?
The biggest addition with this update is that Microsoft Copilot has been added to the AI chatbots available in the sidebar, joining ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and Le Chat Mistral.
Firefox 143 also adds the ability to use Google Lens to search for information on images, but this feature requires Google to be set as the browser’s default search engine. It’s currently rolling out gradually to users. (Lens is already available in Chrome and Opera One, and Edge has a similar function that accesses Bing.)
To manually enable reverse image searches with Google Lens, navigate to the internal configuration page by typing about:config into the address bar, then search for the browser.search.visualSearch.featureGate flag. If the value of the flag is set to “false,” double-click it and change it to “true.” The change should take effect immediately.
On Windows, Firefox 143 can run websites as web apps that can be pinned directly to the Windows taskbar. There’s a new icon on the right-hand side of the address bar for pinning. However, this doesn’t work with Firefox installed from the Microsoft Store. Linux and macOS versions of Firefox will get a similar feature later on.
Other improvements include: the ability to pin tabs by dragging a tab to the designated area at the top of the tab bar; a camera preview when websites request access to the camera; and important dates and events displayed in the address bar (such as Mother’s Day or Easter).
For accessibility applications—like Windows Voice Access, Text Cursor Indicator, and Narrator—Firefox offers the option of using Microsoft UI Automation, allowing such tools to use this interface to interact with the user interfaces of apps. Mozilla also plans to gradually roll out this functionality in the coming weeks.
Security updates in Firefox 143
Mozilla’s Security Advisory 2025-73 for Firefox 143 lists at least 11 eliminated security vulnerabilities. Mozilla categorizes two of the externally reported vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-10527 and CVE-2025-10528) as high risk. These vulnerabilities in the Canvas2D graphics component allow malicious code to break out of the browser sandbox.
The remaining vulnerabilities are considered medium or low risk, with one exception: the last entry concerns an unspecified number of internally discovered memory safety bugs, summarized under identifier CVE-2025-10537. These are also considered high risk.
