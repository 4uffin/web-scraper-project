Google’s new AI app searches ‘anything,’ including your PC
Google is blurring the line (again) between search and AI.

Google said Tuesday that it’s testing a new experimental search app for Windows that will search your PC as well as the web, applying Google Lens when needed.
Google classified its new app as an “experiment,” relegating it to its Labs program for now. The app is simply called “Google app for Windows,” and was explained in a terse blog post on Google’s site.
“Now you can search without switching windows or interrupting your flow,” Google said. “Whether you’re writing in a doc or in the middle of a game, just press Alt + Space to instantly search for information from your computer files, installed apps, Google Drive files — and of course, the web.”
Interestingly, Google did not brand the search app as a “Gemini” project, the name associated with its AI efforts. However, the app certainly blurs the lines between traditional search and AI.

From a search perspective, Google is promising that any results you ask for will be sourced from the web, your local files, as well as any files you might have connected via Google Drive — even local apps. It’s unclear, however, whether this new Search app will surface results culled from Google Meet or even third-party apps like Slack, or if they’ll just be files associated with the keyword you’re looking for.
Google provided a small example, below:

The new Search app has an AI element, too: Google is promising that you’ll be able to allow the new Search app to “see” what’s being displayed on the screen, and ask Search questions prompts to explain it further. This is certainly closer to what Google has shown off in its Gemini app, or what Microsoft allows you to do via Copilot or the version integrated into its Microsoft 365 (Office) apps.
Finally, Google is also promising that you can turn on AI Mode within this search app, if you want its AI capabilities to take over.
To try it, you’ll need to be part of the Google Labs program, and download the app for Windows 10 or Windows 11 PCs on your personal — not Workspace — account. It’s only available to U.S. users, and space is limited, Google said.
