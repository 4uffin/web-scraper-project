LinkedIn is using your data to train its AI models. Here’s how to opt out
Disabling this setting prevents your data from being used, but data already used for training can't be taken back retroactively.

Microsoft-owned social networking site LinkedIn will soon start using the data of its users to train its AI models, reports Windows Latest. The platform has sent out emails to users about the change, which will start November 3rd, 2025 and apply to the US, EU, UK, and Switzerland.
According to LinkedIn, the AI training will improve features such as the algorithm and text rewriting with AI, as well as make it easier for recruiters to find candidates. The data used comes from public profiles and posts, but not from private messages or hidden entries.

The setting is called “Data for Generative AI Improvement” and it’s enabled by default. Fortunately, it’s possible to disable the setting to prevent further use of your data for training LinkedIn’s AI models, but any data already used for training can’t be taken back retroactively.
To disallow use of your data for training LinkedIn’s AI models, click on your profile photo at the top of the LinkedIn site and navigate to Settings > Data Privacy > Data for Generative AI Improvement, then disable the setting labeled “Use my data for training content creation AI models.” Alternatively, click this link to get there right away.
