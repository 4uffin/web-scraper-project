Windows 11’s September update is borked, won’t install for some users
Windows 11 update KB5065426 won't install for some users due to error codes 0x800F0991, 0x800F0922, 0x80071A2D, 0x800F081F, and more

Last week, Microsoft released an important Windows 11 patch known as update KB5065426. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for error reports to start pouring in from users who have been running into all kinds of error codes during installation of the update.
With it being a mandatory update, the Windows Update system will periodically keep trying to install the update even if users have declined, reports Windows Latest. That’s obviously a repetitive nuisance if the update won’t properly install for whatever reason.
Windows Latest has compiled a list of the various error codes that can crop up during installation of the September update, including 0x800F0991, 0x800F0922, 0x80071A2D, 0x800F081F, 0x80070302, 0x80070306, and 0x8000FFFF.
In addition, some users are saying the update takes a lot longer to download than these monthly updates usually take, although that could just be due to the fact that this particular update is larger.
Normally, it’s possible to get around Windows update installation problems by circumventing Windows Update altogether and manually installing an update via the Microsoft Update Catalog. However, with update KB5065426, even this method is throwing errors for some.
According to Windows Latest, the only workaround for this issue right now is to use the Media Creation Tool or Update Assistant Tool.
