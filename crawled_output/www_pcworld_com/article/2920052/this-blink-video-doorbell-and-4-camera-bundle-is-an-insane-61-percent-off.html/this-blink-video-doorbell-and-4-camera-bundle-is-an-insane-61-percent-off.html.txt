If you find it hard to kick back and relax when on vacation or focus at work because you’re worried what’s going on at your house, what you need is a proper home security camera setup. And not just one camera, but several so you can see all the important spots.
Worried it’ll cost a lot? Don’t be! Right now, you can snag this Blink home security camera bundle for a whopping 61 percent off. That’s only $139.99 for a Blink video doorbell plus four Outdoor 4 cameras plus a Sync Module XR, a total value worth $359.98. Insane!
With the Blink video doorbell, you can see right outside your door at all times from your phone, and you can even speak with guests and delivery people using two-way audio. It’s the second-gen model that runs for up to two years on a full charge of three AA batteries (included).
You also get four extra Outdoor 4 cameras that you can set up anywhere up to 1,000 feet from the Sync Module XR. These also last up to two years on a full charge, and they also connect to your home Wi-Fi network so you can view their video feeds from your phone. Paired with the Sync Module XR, you always have access to live footage of your home, alerts and notifications, and integration with Amazon Alexa.
This is an insane deal for anyone who doesn’t have any smart surveillance at home yet. Get started with this Blink video doorbell and four-camera bundle for just $139.99 before this steep discount expires!
