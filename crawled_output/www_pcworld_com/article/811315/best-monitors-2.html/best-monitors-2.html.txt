Need a new monitor for your PC? I’ve combed through scores of options to find the best monitors on the market right now. These picks are the result of hundreds of hours spent testing the latest models from Acer, Asus, BenQ, Dell, LG, Samsung, and other major brands.
While my favorite monitor overall is an awesome choice for most people, I also have alternative options for budget shoppers, gamers, and those seeking the best HDR performance. After all, not everyone needs the same features from a monitor. You can find out more about how I evaluate monitors and what specs matter most below my list of recommendations.
Dell Ultrasharp U2724DE – Best monitor overall
Pros
Attractive and functional design
Class-leading Thunderbolt and USB connectivity
IPS Black improves contrast
120Hz refresh rate
Cons
Most competitors offer 4K resolution
No HDR support
Adaptive sync has some caveats

Who should buy the Dell Ultrasharp U2724DE?
Dell’s Ultrasharp U2724DE is an incredibly versatile monitor that will satisfy most users. It’s great for home office productivity, good for gaming, and can handle more serious content creation workflows, like photo and video editing.
The U2724DE has an IPS Black panel that roughly doubles the monitor’s contrast ratio (compared to other IPS monitors). It can’t beat a more expensive OLED or Mini-LED panel, but it’s still alluring. It also lacks the burn-in worries of OLED which, although unlikely to occur in mixed use, might become an issue if you spend all day working in Excel and plan to keep your monitor for as long as possible.
Dell pairs the IPS Black panel with an enhanced 120Hz refresh rate. Upping the refresh rate greatly improves motion clarity and makes the U2724DE a viable display for gamers. That’s a big deal. It means you can buy one monitor for both work and play.
The U2724DE goes all-in on connectivity. Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort-in and -out, and HDMI are present. It even has a 2.5G Ethernet port. These features are ideal if you plan to connect a laptop over USB-C, as the U2724DE will greatly expand the laptop’s connectivity.
Dell Ultrasharp U2724DE: Further considerations
Resolution is the only notable downside. The U2724DE is a 1440p monitor, while many competitors in its price bracket offer 4K. This is often the trade-off made to hit monitor’s 120Hz refresh rate. For 4K goodness see the Dell U3225QE below. Just know that it’s almost 50 percent more expensive.

Who should buy the Acer Vero B247Y G?
Value shoppers who want a good-quality, versatile monitor at a budget price will be pleased with the Acer Vero B247Y G.
This 24-inch 1080p IPS monitor stands out with its surprising 120Hz refresh rate and Adaptive Sync support, making it suitable for both productivity and PC gaming. It also provides great image quality for a budget display, with above-average scores in contrast ratio and brightness, as well as good color performance.
Build quality exceeds expectations, too, with a fully ergonomic stand that offers height, tilt, swivel, and even pivot adjustments—a rarity in budget displays. The monitor’s clear on-screen menu system provides easy access to various image settings, while the inclusion of both modern (HDMI, DisplayPort) and legacy (VGA) connections ensures compatibility with a wide range of devices.
Acer Vero B247Y G: Further considerations
Though it’s possible to find a less expensive 24-inch 1080p monitor, the Vero B247Y G justifies its slightly higher price through quality-of-life improvements, and it still manages to limbo under $150 when discounted (which it often is). It’s hard to find a more well-rounded budget monitor.

Who should buy the Dell G2724D?
Dell’s G2724D hits the sweet spot for gamers on a budget who also care deeply about quality.
The 27-inch IPS LCD panel features 1440p resolution and a refresh rate of 165Hz. The color gamut spans 100 percent of sRGB, 86 percent of DCI-P3, and 82 percent of Adobe RGB, ensuring a bright and vibrant image that’s not only excellent in games but serviceable for most content creation. But its standout feature is the Adaptive Sync support, with official support for VESA Adaptive Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and Nvidia G-Sync.
Despite its affordable price, the monitor doesn’t skimp on design, with a handsome matte black and gray chassis and sporty rear vents that provide an aggressive yet unobtrusive look. It also comes with a functional monitor stand that offers a range of ergonomic adjustments and a compact base that doesn’t take up unnecessary desktop space.
Dell G2724D: Further considerations
The monitor doesn’t offer USB connectivity or 3.5mm audio-out. Also, the HDR performance is a bit lackluster, so those who require HDR gaming may want to look at other options.
But it’s hard to beat the G2724D’s performance at $200 or below and, more importantly, it offers everything an average PC gamer is going to need for smooth and responsive gaming. All told, it offers excellent value, and could have a place on your desk for five to 10 years.

Who should buy the MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED?
For anyone who wants a high-performance gaming monitor, the MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED should be at the top of your list.
This 26.5-inch display delivers stunning 4K resolution with an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate in a cutting-edge OLED panel. It’s an excellent choice for gamers who want both visual clarity and fluid motion. With its 240Hz refresh rate, the MSI delivers fast-paced gaming yet maintains the deep contrast and vibrant colors that OLED monitors are known for. It also supports Adaptive Sync for smooth frame pacing.
MSI MPG 272URX QD-OLED: Further considerations
The QD-OLED panel offers excellent contrast and color accuracy, which makes it a solid pick for creative professionals and anyone who enjoys watching HDR movies. Connectivity is also generous, with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1a, and USB-C inputs, as well as 98 watts of USB Power Delivery for charging laptops or tablets. The design is a bit plain, but the stand is sturdy and fully adjustable, which is far more important.
The MSI MPG 272URX is more expensive than 1440p OLED alternatives, which can be found for under $800. But if 4K clarity and a fluid 240Hz refresh rate are what you’re after, this monitor is worth the investment.

Who should buy the Dell S2722QC?
If you’re looking for a budget 4K monitor, Dell’s S2722QC is the best option going right now. Initially priced at $380, the monitor can now be found for much less, even dipping below $300. It stands out among other budget offerings by combining 4K resolution and USB-C connectivity typically reserved for more expensive models.
Dell’s 27-inch IPS display is suitable for most lighting conditions, with crisp visuals and a respectable brightness of 296 nits. In addition to its sharp 4K image, the monitor delivers color performance that can easily handle everyday productivity, streaming, and light gaming. A USB-C port with 65 watts of USB Power Delivery for charging a connected laptop or tablet, as well as two USB-A ports for connecting wiring peripherals make it very versatile. The monitor even ships with a sturdy yet compact ergonomic stand that adjusts for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot.
Dell S2722QC: Further considerations
Naturally, the Dell S2722QC makes some compromises to keep the price low. The IPS panel’s contrast ratio is low, which can make the image look flat and dull when playing games or watching a movie. Think of it as more of a home office monitor than the centerpiece of a gaming setup. After all, quality 4K gaming monitors are usually more expensive.
All in all, the Dell S2722QC’s
combination of 4K resolution, USB-C connectivity, and affordability makes it a solid choice if you want a tack-sharp home office monitor at a low price.

Who should buy the Dell U3225QE?
This is a great choice for professionals who want a top-of-the-line home office monitor. The U3225QE has it all: a sharp 31.5-inch 4K IPS Black panel with excellent color accuracy and an above-average contrast ratio for a productivity monitor. The 120Hz refresh rate enhances responsiveness, making tasks like scrolling through documents and multitasking smoother. The ergonomic stand provides height, tilt, swivel, and portrait mode adjustments, and the anti-glare coating ensures comfortable viewing in various lighting conditions.
In addition to all that, the U3225QE’s mitigates the need for external docks and adapters, with generous connectivity. It features Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports with 140W of Power Delivery—enough to charge most laptops—along with HDMI, DisplayPort, and a secondary DisplayPort for daisy-chaining multiple monitors. A built-in 2.5Gbps Ethernet port ensures a fast and stable wired network connection, a rare feature among monitors. It also offers six USB-A ports, a pop-out USB hub with quick-access USB-C and USB-A ports, and KVM switch functionality for seamless switching between two connected PCs.
Dell U3225QE: Further considerations
While it lacks built-in speakers and its HDR performance is limited, the U3225QE’s extensive connectivity and high-quality display make it a standout choice for professionals who need a central hub for their workspace.
Want a smaller version of this monitor? Check out the Dell Ultrasharp U2725QE. It has a similar 4K IPS Black display panel and Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C connectivity.

Who should buy the ProArt Display 5K PA27JCV?
The ProArt Display 5K PA27JCV is perfect for content creators, programmers, designers, and anyone who values ultra-sharp image quality and accurate colors for productivity work.
With a true 5K resolution (5120×2880) on a 27-inch panel, the ProArt Display 5K packs an incredibly crisp 218 pixels per inch. That’s much sharper than 5K ultrawides and nearly matches Apple’s Pro Display XDR. Text is crisp and hi-res photos look lifelike.
The ProArt Display 5K’s color performance and brightness solidify its position. The monitor covers 100 percent of both sRGB and DCI-P3 color spaces, plus 91 percent of AdobeRGB, making it ideal for content creation. Its impressive 578-nit brightness ensures excellent visibility in any lighting condition, too.
ProArt Display 5K PA27JCV: Further considerations
Most compelling is the PA27JCV’s unmatched value proposition. At $800, it’s the most affordable true 5K monitor available as of early 2025. While it has some limitations, like a 60Hz refresh rate and modest contrast ratio, these are minor tradeoffs. It delivers super-sharp 5K resolution, professional-grade color performance, and outstanding value.

Who should buy the Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV?
If you want a 32-inch 6K monitor that delivers exceptional sharpness and strong color performance without the sky-high prices usually attached to this resolution, the ProArt PA32QCV is an easy recommendation.
It’s ideal for professionals, prosumers, and creatives—especially Mac users—who need precise visuals, solid brightness, and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity with 96 watts of power delivery. While it doesn’t claim the very top spot in every technical category, particularly in contrast and HDR performance, its combination of resolution, usability, and value is unmatched.
The ProArt also benefits from attractive design, a highly functional ergonomic stand, and a wide range of options that provide precise monitor adjustment. These features make it easy to tune and calibrate the monitor to fit your needs.
Asus ProArt Display 6K PA32QCV: Further considerations
Shoppers who want additional features should know there are other 6K monitors that provide more connectivity or higher-end capabilities.
Dell’s UltraSharp U3224KB, for example, offers an IPS Black panel, integrated 4K webcam, Ethernet, and more powerful Thunderbolt 4 power delivery, making it a great fit for heavy collaboration workflows. MacBook users may also want to look at Apple’s Pro Display XDR, which offers unmatched HDR brightness and contrast alongside its impeccable build quality.
There’s a big problem with these alternatives, though: They’re outrageously expensive. The Dell U3224KB is currently $2,800 and the Apple Pro Display XDR starts at $5,000. Most people who want 6K resolution will be better off buying the PA32QCV and keeping the extra cash in their wallet.

Who should buy the Viewsonic VP16-OLED?
If you want a monitor that you can easily transport for content creation work, the Viewsonic VP16-OLED will fill that role with aplomb. This impressive monitor combines a class-leading image quality with a unique and useful stand.
The VP16-OLED has a 15.6-inch OLED panel with 1080p resolution. It delivers outstanding image quality, scoring top marks in color accuracy, gamut, and contrast. The VP16-OLED’s performance is superior to many full-sized OLED monitors—and completely smashes portable competitors. This makes the VP16-OLED ideal for photographers, videographers, and other content creators.
The monitor has a versatile stand. It can be used as a kickstand, as is true of most portable monitors, or expand to hold the monitor upright. The stand includes two USB-C ports, either of which can be used to provide power and video input to the monitor. It also offers a micro-HDMI port for use with devices that lack USB-C.
Viewsonic VP16-OLED: Further considerations
Viewsonic bundles the monitor with several cable types and a USB-C power brick, so you don’t have to buy additional adapter cables or accessories.
There’s just one problem: It’s expensive. The Viewsonic VP16-OLED retails at $399.99, more than double the price of a basic 1080p portable monitor. That’s tough to justify if you just need a second monitor to display Slack and Twitter, but it’s a worthwhile upgrade if you care about image quality.

Who should buy the BenQ RD280U?
The BenQ RD280U is the best monitor for coders thanks to its unusual 3:2 aspect ratio, which is much taller than a conventional widescreen. The extra height is great for viewing more lines of code simultaneously and reduces the need for constant scrolling back or forth.
Beyond its unique aspect ratio, the RD280U’s image quality is ideal for long coding sessions. The monitor’s IPS panel delivers excellent color accuracy and wide viewing angles, ensuring code remains clear and legible from any position. The 28-inch display panel has a crisp 3840×2560 resolution, which helps to render small fonts. It also has a matte finish that reduces glare, making it ideal for various lighting conditions.
BenQ RD280U: Further considerations
The monitor has a MoonHalo ambient light and an automatic night mode, both designed to reduce eye strain during extended use — a crucial consideration for programmers who often work long hours. Connectivity is another strong suit of the RD280U, with a versatile array of ports including USB-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and 90 watts of USB Power Delivery. Programmers can easily connect and charge a laptop.
Priced at $599.99, the BenQ RD280U is relatively expensive for a monitor of its size, but its long list of unique features makes it an easy recommendation for coders. The added cost is justified by the fact no competitor offers the same features at any price.

Who should buy the BenQ SW242Q?
Another specialized monitor from BenQ, the SW242Q targets creative professionals with its unique 16:10 aspect ratio and 2560×1600 resolution. Its aspect ratio, which is closer to square than the more typical 16:9, provides additional vertical space for creatives, and its resolution beats most competitive 24-inch monitors.
Designed for professionals, the SW242Q is encased in a sturdy, charcoal black frame and supported by a robust stand that offers adjustments for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot. The stand’s deep and wide base is flat and covered in a luxurious material. Connectivity options include HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C with 90 watts of USB Power Delivery, and an SD card reader.
Where the SW242Q truly excels is its color performance. It boasts an impressive color gamut that covers most of the DCI-P3 and AdobeRGB spaces, which is essential for accurate photo and image editing. The monitor’s color accuracy is bolstered by its low color error and “fine-coated” panel, which is designed to emulate the look and texture of a printed material.
BenQ SW242Q: Further considerations
The BenQ SW242Q has some trade-offs. It has a low measured contrast ratio of 980:1, which reduces the depth and richness of movie and games. Its 60Hz refresh rate and lack of Adaptive Sync underscore its focus on static content over motion clarity. And with a price tag at around $500, the monitor’s cost may be hard to justify for some.
Creative professionals seeking top-notch color accuracy and a 16:10 aspect ratio, however, are likely willing to pay a high price for the monitor’s strengths. It’s the best, most feature-rich 16:10 monitor available right now.

How we test monitors
Our monitor guides are based on testing by freelance and staff contributors with decades of combined experience.
While we rely on our eyes for an initial impression, we thoroughly test each monitor with a Datacolor Spyder X2 Ultra color calibration tool. This specialized hardware can objectively measure a monitor’s brightness, contrast, color gamut, color accuracy, luminance and color uniformity, gamma, and many other aspects of image quality.
Using this tool helps us detect strengths and weaknesses that don’t stand out at a glance and guarantees that a change in lighting conditions or monitor location won’t skew our impression.
For more details, see our article on on how we test monitors at PCWorld.
Why you should trust us
It’s in our name! PCWorld prides itself on PC hardware experience and expertise. We’ve been covering PCs since 1983, and we now review dozens of monitors every year. All of our recommendations have been personally tested and vetted by our expert reviewers, who’ve applied not only performance benchmarks but rigorous usability standards.

How to choose the best monitor
There are literally hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of monitors to choose from. Choosing one from the crowd can be difficult, but knowing the key traits of a monitor will help you make your decision.
Resolution
Most monitors are available in 4K (3840×2160), 1440p (2560×1440), and 1080p (1920×1080) resolution. A higher resolution provides a sharper, more attractive image and is generally preferable. There’s nothing wrong with 1080p, however. It remains the baseline and is by far the most popular resolution sold today.
Connectivity
Look for a monitor with a connection supported by your computer. HDMI and DisplayPort are the most common. USB-C is rising in popularity because it can charge connected devices, such as a laptop.
Refresh rate
Most monitors have a 60Hz refresh rate, but a higher refresh rate (such as 144Hz) will make motion look smooth and crisp. This is most appealing to PC gamers, as improved motion performance is most noticeable when panning the camera in a 3D game.
Adaptive sync
This technology also improves motion performance. It does so by keeping a monitor’s refresh rate in sync with the video input from your computer. Our guide to FreeSync and G-Sync provides more detail.
HDR
Many 4K monitors support HDR, but often the HDR performance is lackluster. The HDR will function, and may look superior to SDR, but it won’t approach the quality implied by the spec. To ensure a quality HDR experience, look for a minimum of VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification (or VESA DisplayHDR True Black). See our article on everything you need to know about HDR on your PC to learn more.

FAQ
1.
What is the best monitor?
The best monitor overall is the Dell Ultrasharp U2724DE. This 27-inch IPS display with 2560×1440 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and extensive connectivity options can truly do it all, from productivity to gaming. It’s solidly built, has ergonomic adjustments, and top-of-its class image quality.
2.
What is the best cheap monitor?
There are monitors that are cheaper than the Acer Vero B247Y G, but none that are nearly as good for the price. Hovering around $150, the 24-inch, 1080p B247Y G exceeds its price range with a 120Hz refresh rate, adaptive sync, a fully adjustable stand, and above-average image quality. A truly great value!
3.
What size of monitor should I buy?
Monitor size depends on personal preference and location.
A 24-inch monitor is fine for a desk that is around 24 inches deep, or less. Its small size will still be sufficient because the monitor is closer to you.
Most people, however, will want to go with a 27-inch monitor. The added size will make the monitor easy to see. This also opens up a wider range of 4K monitor options, as 4K is very rare on a 24-inch monitor.
Larger monitors, such as a 32-inch widescreen or 34-inch ultrawide, are great for deep desks and people who want an immersive experience. Monitors this large can serve as a TV replacement in a small room.
Displays of even larger size, such as 42-inch or 48-inch HDTVs, are best for home theater setups or an unusually large office. You’ll want to sit four to six feet away from a display of this size.
4.
What display input is best? (HDMI vs. DisplayPort vs. USB-C)
USB-C is the best display input for most people. It works by bundling DisplayPort into USB-C, so offers all the same features as DisplayPort. Yet it retains the features of USB-C including optional support for Power Delivery to charge external devices. This is why we recommend a USB-C monitor for most people.
DisplayPort is generally second-best. It supports higher resolutions and refresh rates than HDMI. This input is particularly common on desktop computers.
HDMI comes in third due to lower resolution and refresh rate support. This is improved by HDMI 2.1, but this feature remains hard to find and often adds to a monitor’s price.
All three of the options above handle 1080p at 60Hz, which is the most common resolution and refresh rate available today. It’s also important to buy a monitor that has an input compatible with your PC.
5.
Are all monitors compatible with Windows and MacOS?
Modern monitors are compatible with all recent versions of Windows and MacOS. They’re plug-and-play, which means the monitor should display an image without the need to install driver software or mess with Windows or MacOS settings.
