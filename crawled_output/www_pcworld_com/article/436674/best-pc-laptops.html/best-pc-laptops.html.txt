Let’s be honest–whether you’re grinding through schoolwork, getting lost in your favorite games, or just streaming random stuff late into the night, you need a laptop that can keep up. And yeah, picking the right one? It’s really confusing. Do you spring for a bigger screen? Is a dedicated graphics card actually worth it?

We’ve actually tried out every laptop on this list ourselves, so they’re real recommendations based on hands-on experience.
Why you should trust us: It’s in our name! PCWorld prides itself on laptop experience and expertise. We’ve been covering PCs since 1983, and we now review more than 70 laptops every year. All of the picks below have been personally tested and vetted by our experts, who’ve applied not only performance benchmarks but rigorous usability standards. We’re also committed to reviewing PC laptops at every price point to help you find a machine that matches your budget.
We’ve cut through the clutter to bring you the top picks across every category–from sleek, no-fuss Chromebooks to powerhouse gaming machines.
Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition) – Best laptop overall
Pros
Long battery life (almost 24 hours in our test)
Beautiful OLED screen
Great webcam
Cons
Lunar Lake’s multithreaded performance isn’t ideal for some workloads
Glossy screen can be difficult to read in harsh lighting conditions

Who should buy the Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition)?
This Yoga is easily one of the best Windows laptops you can get right now and this is why: it looks great, it lasts forever, and it has a gorgeous screen. The display is a 14-inch 2880×1800 OLED with HDR that can hit up to 120Hz. Inside you get an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, and Intel Arc 140V graphics. That’s fast enough for work tasks, watching movies, and so on. It also weighs under three pounds and the battery can last up to 23 hours.
Lenovo Yoga 9i 2-in-1 (Aura Edition): Further considerations
The 2-in-1 form factor really adds something extra here. It flips all the way around so you can use it like a tablet or prop it up like a tent. The keyboard is also comfortable to use for long periods of time, the trackpad is smooth under your fingertips, and the Yoga Pen sticks to the top of the laptop via magnets. Ports are decent: You’re getting two Thunderbolt 4, one USB-C, one USB-A, plus a combo audio jack–no HDMI or microSD. Speakers are fine, the rotating soundbar is sort of fun, and battery life is insane.

Who should buy the Acer Aspire Go 15?
The Acer Aspire Go 15 is a cheap and easy laptop that does the basics. It’s good for browsing, emails, and streaming shows. Plus, with about 12 hours of battery, you won’t need to go searching for an outlet.
The appeal mostly lies in its value, though. While more expensive laptops nail the polish and the speed, the budget variety is strictly about what’s functional and that’s exactly what you’re getting here. It’s a good option for students or anyone seeking a reliable, no-frills machine under $500.
You’ll also find a surprisingly generous port selection on the Acer Aspire Go 15–USB-A on both sides, a USB-C, an HDMI, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a Kensington lock. That’s more than what some laptops get twice the price.
Acer Aspire Go 15: Further considerations
Like many laptops in the budget category, the Aspire Go 15’s got a few trade-offs to be aware of. The chassis is made of plastic, though that’s part of what keeps the cost down–cheaper materials. It also weighs a little over four pounds, so it’s not the lightest laptop in town, but it’s not so heavy that it’s prohibitive.

Who should buy the HP OmniBook 5 14?
Looking for a Windows laptop that can actually survive your day on campus? The HP OmniBook 5 14 is solid. It’s got a Snapdragon X Plus X1P-42-100 chip, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage–so essays, Zoom calls, and a bunch of tabs won’t slow it down. The 14-inch 1920×1200 OLED touchscreen also looks really good, and the battery is insane. We’re talking, like, 25 hours in our testing (jeez!).
HP OmniBook 5 14: Further considerations
This isn’t a gaming rig or a 3D workstation, but for school stuff, streaming, and everyday tasks it’s more than fine. The keyboard’s comfy, the OLED display pops, and the ports are basic but usable (two USB-C, one USB-A, headphone jack).
The main draw? Ridiculous battery life, a nice OLED screen, and super easy portability–all under $900.

Who should buy the Lenovo Legion 5i?
Want zippy gaming performance without dropping a ton of moolah? The Lenovo Legion 5i hits that sweet spot. It’s rocking an Intel Core i9 CPU and an RTX 4060 GPU, so expect high frame rates on modern games at 1080p. Plus, that 165Hz screen? Makes everything look sharp and buttery smooth.
Lenovo Legion 5i: Further considerations
There are some nice extras worth noting. The first is a 1080p webcam with a physical shutter and the second is a full-sized keyboard with a number pad. It might not seem like much on paper, but these things are important and further add to the value as a whole.

Who should buy the Acer Nitro V 16?
Need a gaming laptop that won’t decimate your wallet? The Acer Nitro V 16 is where the fun begins. With an RTX 4060 GPU and a Ryzen 7 CPU, it handles most games at 1080p without breaking a sweat. It’s not some over-the-top, showy powerhouse–honestly, that’s the appeal. It just does its job without draining your wallet.
The 16-inch 1200p display is quick and smooth thanks to its 165Hz refresh rate, which makes a big difference whether you’re in a fast-paced game or just scrolling around. For around $1,000, you’re getting great performance without all the extra fluff. It’s a good, no-nonsense pick if you just want to play games and get on with your day.
Acer Nitro V 16: Further considerations
The thing about the Nitro V 16 is that it really leans into the gamer aesthetic with its sharp lines and glowing keyboard. If you dig that style, cool. If not, this might not be the laptop for you. The battery life lasts about four hours, which is typical for a laptop in this category, but you probably can’t game untethered — at least not for very long!

Who should buy the Asus ProArt P16?
If you want sharp, gorgeous visuals and a laptop that can handle some serious work, the Asus ProArt P16 is a strong pick.
The 16-inch 3840×2400 screen makes everything look awesome — whether you’re editing photos or just watching movies. Inside, it’s got an Intel Core i9 CPU and an RTX 4070 GPU, so it can easily handle heavy stuff like video editing. Battery life is pretty good too, around nine hours, so you’re not stuck hunting for an outlet all day. And with USB 4.0, moving big files is quick and painless. All in all, it’s a great machine if you want power without the fuss.
Asus ProArt P16: Further considerations
Performance and display quality are the standout features here, of course, but understated design deserves a mention too. Some may find the all-black chassis too plain while others find it elegant. Also, under heavy workloads, the chassis can run a little warm.

Who should buy the Microsoft Surface Pro (2025)?
If you’re always on the go — whether it’s the train, a coffee shop, or just hopping around the house — the Surface Pro 2025 is pretty much made for that. It’s super light (under two pounds!) and still powerful enough to handle all the usual stuff like emails and Zoom calls.
With its Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus CPU, it’s great for anyone who wants something that works like a laptop but feels like a tablet. You can doodle or get work done, all without feeling like you’re lugging around a heavy brick.
Microsoft Surface Pro (2025): Further considerations
The smaller screen might not be great if you’re juggling a bunch of stuff all day, and there’s only two USB-C ports (so you’ll probably need a dock or something). Battery life can last a while, but honestly, it’s kind of all over the place. Expect around two hours at full brightness under heavy use or up to 19 hours with lighter tasks.
Still, if your work mostly lives in the cloud and you value portability above raw power, this is the best ultraportable Windows device you can get right now.

Who should buy the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2-in-1?
If you need a laptop that just won’t quit, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 seriously impressed us with how long the battery life hangs on. PCWorld clocked in at close to 25 hours—so you won’t be stuck hunting for outlets throughout the day.
Stamina aside, it’s also very portable at under three pounds. Add in the flexible 2-in-1 design and a seriously good keyboard, and you’ve got a laptop built to keep up with real-life stuff.
Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2-in-1: Further considerations
There’s a lot to love here, but it’s not cheap ($2,336 as tested). And if you want a built-in SD card reader, for instance, you’ll need to pick up a dongle. But if you need a professional laptop that truly lasts, this is it.

Who should buy the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34?
If you need a zippy Chromebook for everyday tasks, the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 won’t let you down–it’s simple, reliable, and ready to handle whatever your day throws at it. This machine will easily crush your daily workflow thanks to its Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. The 14-inch 1080p display also looks sharp, and the 1080p webcam is perfect for Zoom calls.
Asus Chromebook Plus CX34: Further considerations
While the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 offers smooth performance and a pretty design, there are minor trade-offs to be aware of like the non-competitive battery life (13 hours) and the lack of a touchscreen. You’ll also need to be comfortable with ChromeOS. If you prefer Windows or macOS, we’d recommend looking elsewhere.

Who should buy the MacBook Air (M4)?
The new MacBook Air M4 is a fantastic option if you want something light but still strong. It’s running a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine–that’s a lot of muscle for such a slim laptop. Day-to-day stuff feels effortless, and when you need to push it harder, it holds its own way better than you’d expect from a MacBook Air.
Apple also fixed one of the Air’s biggest limitations—you can finally run two external 6K displays with the lid open, which is a game-changer if you love a multi-monitor setup. The 12MP Center Stage webcam makes video calls look sharper, and in our battery tests, it lasted about 18 hours, so you can leave the charger at home most days.
MacBook Air (M4): Further considerations
This thing is crazy light at just over three pounds and thin at under half an inch, so it basically disappears in your bag. The new Sky Blue finish looks slick, and pricing starts at $999 for the 13-inch or $1,199 for the 15-inch. Even better, the base models now ship with 16GB of RAM, so you don’t have to immediately think about upgrading memory.
The only real tradeoff? Battery life is about an hour shorter than the M3 model in video loop tests. But honestly, with nearly 18 hours on tap, it’s still more than enough to power you through a full day (and night).

Who should buy the Framework Laptop 13 (2025)?
Need a laptop that’s super easy to upgrade and tough enough to stick around? The Framework Laptop 13 (2025) is where it’s at. You can swap out pretty much anything—RAM, storage, even the motherboard if you want. It runs on an AMD Ryzen AI 300 processor and is slim enough to toss in your bag and go wherever.
Framework Laptop 13 (2025): Further considerations
The price might sting a bit upfront, and the built-in graphics are okay for everyday stuff, but don’t expect much gaming performance. Battery life’s decent, but nothing groundbreaking.

Other notable laptops we’ve tested
These laptops didn’t crack the top of our list, but they’re still good picks. The Dell 14 Premium is an elegant machine with a vibrant 3200×2000 OLED display, strong CPU performance, and Thunderbolt 4 ports. It’s powerful, even if it skips a few legacy ports. The HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a 16-inch professional workhorse with long battery life (nearly 16 hours!) and an AMD Ryzen AI 7 PRO 350 processor, making it great for heavy multitasking, though its GPU is a bit limited. And if a larger screen is what you’re after, the Dell 16 Plus has a 16-inch 2560×1600 display that’s clear and easy to read indoors, Copilot+ integration for AI tasks, and good everyday performance in a well-designed chassis. That said, it’s a bit heavier than other ultraportables and it doesn’t excel at heavy multithreaded workloads.
How we test laptops
The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we’ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests.
For a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out how PCWorld tests laptops.
Who curated this article?
Hi, I’m Ashley Biancuzzo, and I oversee all laptop and Chromebook coverage at PCWorld. While you’ll see me review Chromebooks on occasion, I’m also deeply immersed the broader world of consumer tech. I spend a lot of time writing and thinking about where laptops are headed–from AI and sustainable designs to long-term trends. When I’m not deep in the world of tech, you’ll probably find me gaming, getting lost in a good book, or chilling with my rescue greyhound, Allen.
How to choose the best laptop
What’s the best laptop style?
Regular ones are fine for everyday stuff. 2-in-1s are cool because the screen flips around. Chromebooks are cheap and good if you mostly do web browsing.
How much power?
Depends on what you’re doing. For basic web or email, an Intel Core i3 or Ryzen 3 works fine. If you’re into video editing or creative stuff, an i7/i9 or Ryzen 7/9 is better. And if you’re handling heavy 4K editing or lots of apps, a Ryzen 9 is your best bet.
Discrete graphics vs. integrated graphics?
Gamers and video editors need a legit graphics card—Nvidia, AMD, something with real muscle. But if all you’re doing is YouTube, emails, and Netflix, the built-in graphics won’t hold you back.
How much RAM?
8GB of RAM is plenty for most stuff. If you’re gaming, 16GB is better, and 32GB will keep you covered for a while. Content creators should try to get as much RAM as they can.
What’s the right display size?
Doing video edits? Go bigger—15 or 17 inches helps a ton. For everyday use, 13 or 14 inches usually does the trick. Light enough to toss in your bag, not a pain to carry, and still plenty of space to get stuff done.
Battery-life expectations
If you’re gonna carry your laptop around, try to get one that lasts 10 to 12 hours on a charge. That’s usually enough for a long flight or a full day of classes. Some of the new Snapdragon laptops are even crushing that, with one going up to 25 hours thanks to their super-efficient chips. Just remember, bigger batteries usually mean heavier laptops. (Also, check out our roundup of the best laptop chargers.)
Laptop pricing guide
A decent laptop usually runs $500 to $750. If money’s tight, a Chromebook or a basic work laptop under $500 will get you by. Push closer to $1,000 and you’ll start seeing nicer screens and more speed, but it really depends on what you need.
Don’t forget the ports
I like laptops with lots of ports so you don’t need adapters. Having both USB-C and USB-A is great, and an HDMI port is a bonus and super handy for hooking up to a monitor.
