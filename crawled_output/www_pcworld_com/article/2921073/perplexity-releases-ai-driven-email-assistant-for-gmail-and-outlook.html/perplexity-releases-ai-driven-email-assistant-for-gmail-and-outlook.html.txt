AI company Perplexity, best known for its free AI-powered answer engine, is now launching another AI-powered tool called Perplexity Email Assistant. This AI assistant integrates directly into your email inbox and can help you maintain better control over your email.
Email Assistant can write email drafts in your own tone and conversational style, organize messages, suggest meeting times, and even participate in email threads to save you time on long exchanges. You can also directly ask questions and make requests to Email Assistant, whether to find specific emails that are most urgent for an upcoming meeting or to get a summary of all emails related to a budget, for example.
Perplexity emphasizes that Email Assistant is secure, compliant with SOC 2 and GDPR by default, and doesn’t train on your data.
As of this writing, Email Assistant is exclusively available to Perplexity’s Max subscription plan ($200 per month) and works with both Gmail and Outlook. Max subscribers can sign up for Email Assistant here.
