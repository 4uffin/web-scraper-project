Mouse acceleration wrecks PC gaming. Here’s how to turn it off
How mouse acceleration affects your gameplay and work.

Mouse acceleration, called “Enhance Pointer Acceleration” in Windows 11, dynamically adjusts the cursor movement based on the speed of the physical mouse. The faster you move the mouse, the further the pointer travels across the screen. The function is activated by default.
This can be very useful for everyday office work: users with small mousepads or trackpads can cover large distances on the screen with minimal effort. However, those who need precise input, for example, when gaming or using graphical applications, may quickly reach their limits. In this case, smooth, predictable pointer movement is more important than comfort.
In competitive games such as Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, or PUBG, many players rely on absolute control. Mouse acceleration is often counterproductive in these situations, as it distorts the relationship between hand movement and the cursor’s path. For this reason, many professionals therefore deliberately deactivate this function.
To deactivate mouse acceleration in Windows 11, press the Windows Start button, then type main.cpl in the search bar. Press Enter, and the “Mouse Properties” window will open. Next, click the “Pointer Options” tab.
Under “Motion,” you will find the option “Improve Pointer Acceleration,” which you can turn off by unchecking the box. Alternatively, you can also fine-tune the acceleration using the slider–i.e., make it faster or slower.
If you own a gaming mouse, you can often set the DPI values–the sensitivity in pixels per inch (PPI) –precisely using the manufacturer’s software. Many models let you switch between several DPI levels at the touch of a button, for example, for slow and more precise aiming or for fast camera panning.
To react precisely in fast games, effects such as mouse acceleration should be disabled — especially on high-end mice with precise sensors.Razer
Ultimately, the following applies: For maximum precision, mouse acceleration should be disabled. If you prioritize comfort or use simpler input devices, you can continue using it. A quick self-test will show which setting works best for you.
