Can you ever have too many cables, especially high-speed ones? We don’t think you can, since those things go missing left and right, either they vanish after you lend them out, your robovac eats them up, or your puppy gnaws on them.
Thankfully, these two 100W Anker cables are about the price of a pumpkin spice latte, so we’re sure you can spare some change to get them. They’re available for $9 at Amazon, which comes with a 44 percent discount–music to our ears!
These six-foot USB-C-to-C cables can deliver 100W of charging power, as long as you have a charger that can handle that much—like this one! Your gadgets (including your laptop) will be recharged in no time.
Given their length, you won’t have to worry about hanging on the edge of your bed while scrolling through TikToks, or stretching to reach the outlet from your desk.
The cables are also built to withstand thousands of bends, and the braided nylon cover makes them resistant to many everyday mishaps, including the occasional desk chair rolling over them.
So grab this 100W Anker USB-C two-pack for $9 while the deal lasts.
