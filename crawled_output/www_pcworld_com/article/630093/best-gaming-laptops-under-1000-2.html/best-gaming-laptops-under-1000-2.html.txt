Who should buy the Acer Nitro V 16?
If you want a gaming laptop under $1,000 that actually performs well, the Acer Nitro V 16 is a top pick. It gets the important stuff right like respectable performance thanks to its eight-core Ryzen 7 8845HS processor and RTX 4060 GPU. Won’t wreck your wallet, either.
Games like Fortnite or Apex look pretty sweet on the 16-inch 1920×1200 screen–it’s sharp and smooth with that 165Hz refresh rate.
Acer Nitro V 16: Further considerations
The Nitro V 16 is pretty close to a full package. The screen’s great and the graphics are respectable. But like most gaming laptops, you’ll want to keep it plugged in for serious gaming. The battery’s decent, but don’t count on all-day play without the charger nearby.

Who should buy the Acer Nitro V 15?
If you absolutely love your accessories (no shade here — I love using my gaming headset), then you’ll definitely want to check out the Acer Nitro V 15. You’ll find three USB-A ports, a USB-C, HDMI 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, and even a 3.5mm audio jack. This is great if you prefer using an external mouse, keyboard, monitor, and so on.
If you’re mainly gaming at 1080p (and let’s be real, most of us are), the Nitro V 15’s got you covered. Inside you’ll find an Intel Core i5-13420H paired with an RTX 4050, which is a really nice combo for smooth frame rates. No, it’s not the kind of setup you’d use to max out 4K ultra settings, but for medium to high settings at 1080p, it delivers a super solid experience.
Acer Nitro V 15: Further considerations
The standout here is the connectivity, there’s no doubt about that. The base model only has 8GB of RAM, which is fine for gaming, but if you’ve got a bunch of tabs open it can slow down. The 15.6-inch 1080p screen is fine too, though it’s nothing fancy (not OLED) so don’t expect bold colors and contrast so deep you could drown in it.

Who should buy the Acer Chromebook 516 GE?
If you’re into cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass or Nvidia’s GeForce Now, this one’s worth a look. It’s running an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD storage, which is plenty for Chrome OS. The 16-inch 2560×1600 screen is surprisingly sharp, the 120Hz refresh rate keeps things smooth, and the price usually hovers around $650 or less. It’s a good deal if you want something affordable that can play cloud games well, but also works for the day-to-day stuff.
Acer Chromebook 516 GE: Further considerations
It won’t run games locally, so you’ll need a solid internet connection. The screen looks good, the keyboard and speakers are just whatever (you can always plug in better peripherals for gaming), and the webcam’s meh. Battery life’s great, though–we clocked it at just over 14 hours.

Other products tested
If you’re on a budget under $1,000, these gaming laptops didn’t make the top pick list, but are still pretty awesome. The Dell G15 and Lenovo LOQ 15 are both solid picks if you want to game without spending a ton. They don’t come with all the fancy extras you’d see on pricier gaming laptops, but they play games just fine.
The Nitro V 16 , the Nitro V 15, and the Chromebook 516 GE are strong picks under $1,000. Just keep in mind that those prices usually depend on deals, so it’s worth checking our deals roundup to see what’s on sale right now.
How we test gaming laptops
The PCWorld team puts each and every Windows laptop through a series of benchmarks that test GPU and CPU performance, battery life, and so on. The idea is to push the laptop to its limits and then compare it against others we’ve tested. Chromebooks, on the other hand, go through a series of web-based tests.
For a much deeper look at our review methodology, check out how PCWorld tests laptops.
Who curated this article?
Hi, I’m Ashley Biancuzzo, and I oversee all laptop and Chromebook coverage at PCWorld. While you’ll see me review Chromebooks on occasion, I’m also really into the broader world of consumer tech. I spend a lot of time writing and thinking about where laptops are headed–from AI and sustainable designs to long-term trends. When I’m not deep in the world of tech, you’ll probably find me gaming, getting lost in a good book, or chilling with my rescue greyhound, Allen.
How to choose the best gaming laptop under $1,000
The first question you should ask yourself is this: What type of games are you into? Do you like relaxing games like Stardew Valley? Or are you pushing pixels in Cyberpunk 2077? Maybe you also need something that can handle school or work. The good news is you can get a great machine for under $1,000; you just have to be smart about where your money goes.
GPU (graphics card)
The GPU’s like the gaming laptop’s heart—it powers all the graphics. You usually can’t upgrade it, so make sure you pick one strong enough for your games.
RTX 4050 – Good for 1080p gaming on Medium to High settings.
RTX 4060 – Even better. Smooth gameplay on High or Ultra settings.
RTX 3060 – Older, but still handles 1080p like a champ.
RTX 3070 / 3070 Ti – Rare under $1,000, but a steal if you can snag one.
RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti – A step up from entry-level, but starting to show their age.
GTX 1650 – Very basic. Okay for older or lighter games, but not great for anything demanding.
CPU (processor)
If the GPU is the beating heart, then the CPU is most definitely the brain, as it’s responsible for the decision making. The CPU also isn’t typically upgradeable, so it’s worth getting one that’ll hold up over time. When comparing options, go for the chip with newer architecture or higher boost clock speeds, as it’ll usually offer better long-term performance.
Spring for at least an Intel 13th- or 14th-gen Core i5/i7 or an AMD Ryzen 7000 series chip.
Newer Ryzen models with RDNA 3 integrated graphics (like the 7840HS or 8845HS) are great if you’re skipping a dedicated GPU.
More cores and threads help with multitasking, streaming, and heavier games.
AMD’s latest Ryzen AI chips (part of the Strix Point and Hawk Point families) bring a few extra perks:
Offers strong multi-core performance, ideal for more demanding workloads.
NPUs (Neural Processing Units) are designed to exclusively handle AI-related tasks like background effects. The offloading of those tasks from the CPU and GPU helps to improve overall performance.
RAM
8GB is the minimum, but 16GB is ideal and usually worth the upgrade.
RAM is often upgradable later, but not always, so check before you buy.
Storage
Aim for at least 512GB SSD.
SSD also load games faster and many laptops let you add more storage later.
Display
Most budget gaming laptops come with 1080p screens, usually 60Hz or 144Hz.
144Hz is preferred for smoother gameplay.
If the built-in screen is dim or lacks color punch, an external monitor is always an option.
Battery life
Gaming laptops aren’t known for marathon battery life.
Expect four to six hours tops.
They’re heavier too due to all that cooling hardware.
FAQ
1.
What is the best gaming laptop under $1,000?
If you’re after the best gaming laptop under $1,000, the Acer Nitro V 16 is a good choice, offering smooth performance, a sharp 16-inch 165Hz screen, and an RTX 4060 GPU that handles modern games without breaking the bank.
2.
What’s the difference between a gaming laptop and a regular laptop?
A gaming laptop is basically a regular laptop on steroids. It’s built with stronger graphics, faster processors, and better cooling to handle intense games, while a regular laptop is more for everyday stuff like browsing and work. So, gaming laptops can run games smoothly, but regular ones usually can’t keep up.
3.
When is the best time to buy a gaming laptop?
The best time to grab a gaming laptop is during big sales like Black Friday or back-to-school deals when prices drop and you can score some sweet discounts.
4.
Can Chromebooks handle gaming?
Chromebooks can handle web games and Android apps just fine, but AAA titles? Uh, not really. At least not locally. However, cloud gaming lets you play those AAA titles on a Chromebook via a streaming service. You’ve got to sign up for a streaming service like GeForce Now to play those types of games, though.
5.
Can you play games on integrated graphics?
You totally can! Intel Iris Xe and AMD RDNA 3 can handle newer games at 1080p on low settings pretty smoothly.
6.
What’s the best laptop size for gaming?
If you’re always on-the-go, spring for a lighter 13- or 14-inch. If you plan on keeping your laptop most of the time, 15- or 17-inch laptops give you more power and a larger screen—just a bit heavier. Easy!
