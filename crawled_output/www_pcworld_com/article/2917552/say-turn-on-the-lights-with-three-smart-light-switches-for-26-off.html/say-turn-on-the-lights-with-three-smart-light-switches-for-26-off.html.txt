Honestly, the best thing you can do to control your lights at home is to replace your light switches. Right now, you can get three Kasa smart light switches for just $52–that’s 26 percent off at Amazon.
These single-pole light switches are super easy to install, but they require a neutral wire to work. If you don’t have one, this model won’t work for you. Otherwise, they’re easy to swap out and function just like traditional switches.
They need to be set up on your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network, like other smart home gadgets. Once that’s done, the world’s your oyster. You can integrate the switches with your regular smart home system–Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Home, or Matter–and issue voice commands, set up schedules and auto-off timers, and pair multiple switches together.
Go ahead and make your life easier by grabbing this three pack of Kasa smart light switches for 26 percent off.
