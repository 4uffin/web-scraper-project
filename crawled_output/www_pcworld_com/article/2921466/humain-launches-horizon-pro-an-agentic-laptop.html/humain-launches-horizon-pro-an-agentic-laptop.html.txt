Meet the wild new Snapdragon laptop built for agentic AI: ‘100 times faster than human thought’
Details of the new Horizon Pro laptop aren't wholly known, but it was unveiled at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit.

Humain has unveiled the Horizon Pro PC, a laptop powered by agentic AI and a Snapdragon chip that the company claims “can operate 100 times faster than human thought.”
The laptop, powered by a first-generation Snapdragon X Elite processor from Qualcomm, was shown using Windows 11 at the Snapdragon Technology Summit, hosted by Qualcomm in Maui. The Horizon Pro laptop uses an “agentic OS” from Humain called the Humain One OS.
Humain chief executive Tareq Amin said that the Humain One software would officially launch on October 27 at Saudia Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, an investment conference hosted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Humain isn’t announcing a price for the Horizon Pro quite yet, or when you’ll be able to buy one. Amin hinted that he cares less about the up-front cost of the device versus its long -term value. “So when we share the price structure for this, nothing in the market will be at the same price,” he said.

Humain says that the Horizon Pro laptop is designed for both consumers and enterprises. It also promises up to 18 hours of battery life thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X1 Elite chip inside it. Other key specs include 32GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, a 14-inch 2880×1800 OLED display, a 1080p webcam, and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, Humain said.
One of the nifty little quirks of the laptop is its dedicated key, which replaces the Copilot key on Windows laptops. It’s unclear whether this will be called the “Humain key” or something else, but it’s still an interesting little twist that sets the Humain Horizon Pro apart.

The software side of the Horizon Pro: Humain OS
Based in Saudi Arabia, Humain was launched by the country’s Public Investment Fund and was designed to lead the region in AI development. Amin said that the “build” — presumably referring to the Humain One OS — was developed in just seven months.
The name “OS” might be a bit of an exaggeration, as well. The Horizon Pro laptops Humain showed off at the Qualcomm event all ran Windows, and Amin acknowledged that the original product used to be called “Humain OS,” but that the idea was to drop the “OS” portion — which it hasn’t done quite yet. But it’s essentially an app.
“Now, imagine someone takes this platform and asks a simple question: what does the future compute operating system need to look like?” Amin said. “Can this exist in Linux? Yes, it could. And that’s why I said, look, I don’t want to compete in this space of an operating system. I’ll just live on top of the OS.”

As part of the app, Amin said that Humain will launch Humain Search, an AI-based search engine, as well as Humain Create, which can generate art and videos — including, Amin said, those that run on the company’s Web site. Separately, Humain has already launched an app called Humain Chat. That chatbot is powered by what Humain calls its Allam model, a 34-billion-parameter model that Amin said was built from scratch.
Humain said the Horizon Pro PC will be sold to businesses with an accompanying lease subscription that includes its AI solutions suite. The laptop will also be sold to consumers, with Humain’s AI applications pre-installed, though it sounds like they’ll need to be unlocked and activated. The company will also give away 500 laptops to students.

“The Humain Horizon Pro represents the future of intelligent personal computing,” Cristiano Amon, the chief executive of Qualcomm, said in a statement. “Powered by our Snapdragon X Elite processors, it delivers groundbreaking performance and innovative AI-first experiences for enterprises and consumers. We are proud of this partnership with HUMAIN, which is delivering on the vision of disruptive agentic AI personal computing and hybrid AI.”
Eventually, Humain promises that the company will deliver a “Horizon Ultra,” but the specifications, capabilities, and timeline for that device weren’t disclosed.

Disclosure: Qualcomm held its press briefings in Hawaii, and would not pre-brief reporters in other locations or over video meetings. They paid for my room, boarding, and travel expenses, but did not ask for or exert any editorial control over this story or other PCWorld content.
