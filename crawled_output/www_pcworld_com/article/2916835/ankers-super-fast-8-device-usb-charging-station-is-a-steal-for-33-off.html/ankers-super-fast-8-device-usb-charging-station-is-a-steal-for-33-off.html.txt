You know what needs upgrading on your desk right now? Not your laptop and not your monitor. I’m talking about your power strip, which tends to get overlooked. Why settle for a conventional clunker when you can level things up with this 8-in-1 Anker Prime charging station? And it’s 33% off on Amazon right now, bringing it down to pretty much its best-ever price: $99.99 (was $149.99).
This charging station will seriously simplify your desk and your life. At just 0.7 inches thick and 5.43 inches long, it’s compact and won’t take up much desk space. Plus, it’s flat so it looks sleek and elegant. But the real benefit here is that it sports eight ports: two AC outlets on the face, two USB-A ports along the side, and four USB-C ports along the bottom.
Each AC outlet has its own on/off button, plus there’s an LCD display on front that shows you its charging status in real time. Each USB-C port can provide up to 140W of charging on its own, with a total throughput of 240W across all six USB ports (split amongst them when multiple ports are being used simultaneously). This charging station is perfect for plugging in your laptop, phone, monitor, PC, and everything else.
Two cherries on top here: first, it connects to your Wi-Fi network so you can check on its charging status via the companion mobile app, and second, it has a detachable power cable so it’s easy to pack up and take with you when you go to hotels and Airbnbs.
This 8-in-1 Anker Prime charging station is a real game-changer, so get it now while this superb discount is still available.
