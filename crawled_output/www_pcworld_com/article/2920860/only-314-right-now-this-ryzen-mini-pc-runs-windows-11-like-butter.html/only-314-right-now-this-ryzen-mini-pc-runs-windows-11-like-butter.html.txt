If you’re tired of your sluggish PC and want to upgrade but don’t have the funds for a well-specced laptop or desktop, then what you need is a mini PC like this Acemagician Kron K1. On top of offering solid performance, it’s extremely affordable now that it’s on sale for just $314.10 (was $419). That’s with this Prime-exclusive discount which you can score just by signing up for a 30-day free trial of Prime. (And why wouldn’t you? With Prime Big Deal Days coming in early October, you can also use that free trial to score superb deals during that sales event!)
The value of this mini PC is hard to overstate. For starters, it packs an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor that’s only three years old and still fast enough to handle modern apps with responsive smoothness. Throw in the 32GB of RAM and you have a lovely combo that won’t get bogged down by Windows 11 or excessive browser tabs. The 1TB SSD is a nice cherry on top in this price range. It’s the perfect home office PC.
But it gets even better when you realize it can support up to three 4K@60Hz external monitors via its HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C video connections. External drives and peripherals are also no problem thanks to a whopping six fast USB-A ports, and it’s all rounded out by an Ethernet port, 3.5mm audio, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5.2.
This is frankly an insane price for a machine of this caliber, so don’t pass up this chance to get the Acemagician Kron K1 for only $314.10. Remember you’ll need a Prime membership for this exclusive discount (sign up for a free 30-day Prime trial) and be sure to clip the on-page coupon to snag that extra $30 off and get this extra-low price.
