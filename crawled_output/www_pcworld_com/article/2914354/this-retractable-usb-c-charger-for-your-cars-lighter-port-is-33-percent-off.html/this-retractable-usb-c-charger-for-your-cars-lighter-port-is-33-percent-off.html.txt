As a busy mom, one of the bigger inconveniences in my life is when I’m in my car and my phone is on the verge of dying. I can always plug it into one of my car’s USB ports to charge, but rooting around for the cable in my center console is a pain, and I hate how messy it feels with that long cable flopping about while I drive.
If you’re like me, you’re going to love getting this retractable USB-C charging cable for car aux power outlets (also known as cigarette lighter ports). Normally $29.99, it’s now just $19.99 with this timely discount.
It’s so easy to use: just plug it into your car’s 12V outlet, usually located in the center stack next to the navigation, radio, AC controls, etc. Pull on the retractable cable, which extends up to 31.5 inches in length, and plug that into your phone. Boom! Now it’s charging. You can also leave it plugged in when not in use and it won’t take up any space because the cable retracts back into its “ultra mini” form factor.
I love that this charger also has an additional USB-C port where you can plug in another cable to charge a second device. With a cable that’s 6 or 10 feet long, it can even reach the back seats for your passengers! The charger provides a max output of 30W to each—the built-in retractable cable and the separate USB-C port—for fast charging on both.
If you’re on the road a lot, this is a serious game-changer—and it’s a phenomenal get for just $19.99. Snag it on sale while you can because this limited-time deal won’t last forever!
