If you aren’t already bracing for price increases across the tech industry, you might want to start because it’ll soon be more expensive to buy storage and memory from one of the world’s premier brands.
South Korean website New Daily reports that tech giant Samsung has announced price increases for DRAM memory and NAND drives.
Starting in Q4 of 2025, Samsung’s DRAM memory will jump up in price between 15 and 30 percent while their NAND drives will be around 5 to 10 percent more expensive. Increased demand from cloud companies is said to be one of the reasons driving the price increase.
Samsung is not alone in increasing the price of its memory and storage. Wccftech writes that SanDisk’s NAND devices will also be 10 percent more expensive while Micron will increase the price of its memory and storage products by 20 to 30 percent.
