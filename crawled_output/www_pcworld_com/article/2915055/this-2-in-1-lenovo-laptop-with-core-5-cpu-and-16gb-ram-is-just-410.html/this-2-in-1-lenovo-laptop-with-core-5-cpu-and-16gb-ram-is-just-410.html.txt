Hot dang, have I got a solid deal for you if you want a value laptop. The Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 combines plenty of power and a convertible touchscreen for a great mix of parts, and today you can grab a refurbished model off eBay for just $410.
When PCWorld reviewed this laptop, we weren’t fans at its original $1,100 price tag (note, that was with a more powerful processor). But at less than half of that price for a refurbished model with an Intel Core 5 120U processor and 16GB of RAM, I think it makes a lot more sense. Other highlights include a roomy 16-inch 1920×1200 touchscreen, 512GB of storage, and an infrared webcam for Windows Hello face unlock.
This is a larger laptop thanks to that 16-inch touchscreen, and it’s on the heavy side too at 4.59 pounds. It also doesn’t have incredible battery life like some of the competition. But that big frame means plenty of ports (double USB-C, double USB-A, full-sized HDMI, microSD) and the keyboard has room for a full number pad. As a “manufacturer refurbished” unit distributed by Lenovo, it comes with a two-year Allstate warranty, which is better than the typical 90 days for a refurb.
eBay says that this particular sale lot is trending, so it might not stick around for long. I’m even seeing an extra $5 off discount, but that appears to be variable. If it’s not what you’re looking for, be sure to check out our roundup of the best laptops, including budget options.
