As much as you may hate Zoom meetings, you still have to attend them—and you probably want to look good while doing so. Don’t have Zoom meetings to worry about? A good webcam is still worth having, whether to video chat with friends, to record YouTube videos, or to have something on hand for a remote job interview.
Fortunately, high-quality 4K webcams don’t have to cost a lot anymore. Take this Obsbot Meet 2 webcam, for instance. Normally $139, you can now grab it for just $108.99 on sale with a 22 percent discount. That’s a darn good price for a webcam that captures 4K at 60 FPS.
As a general rule, we’ve had good experiences with Obsbot webcams here at PCWorld, with one of them even holding a spot in our roundup of the best overall webcams. Given the Meet 2’s stellar 4.4-star rating on Amazon combined with its lovely specs, I’m confident this one will be a great addition to your setup—especially for this price.
On top of capturing 4K footage, the Obsbot Meet 2 features AI features that help the camera dynamically adjust its composition and focus, so you always look good whether you’re alone or in a group. You can also make gestures to control the camera, such as pinching the air to make it zoom in. This makes the Meet 2 awesome for live streaming while gaming.
This webcam has a sleek design that’s great for travel, with it being easy to shove into a bag and take with you wherever you go. Setting up the webcam is easy too, as you only need to plug it into a USB-C port for both power and video feed.
Get one of the best value 4K webcams out there with this discount: the Obsbot Meet 2 for just $108.99.
