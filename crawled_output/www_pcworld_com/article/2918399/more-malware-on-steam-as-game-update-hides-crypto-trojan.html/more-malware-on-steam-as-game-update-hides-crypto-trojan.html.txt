Malware strikes Steam again as game update hides crypto trojan
For the fourth time in 2025, Steam has been infected by an alleged malware attack. This time it's managed to steal $150,000 in crypto before being taken down, according to investigators.

Steam has a lot of problems, but it’s widely considered the best PC gaming store and platform. But being number one makes you a target, and one of those problems appears to be a growing number of malware attacks that use Steam as a delivery vector. The latest was spotted in a freebie game…but not before it allegedly managed to steal a small fortune in cryptocurrency.
The game is BlockBlasters, and I’m linking to SteamDB because it’s been vanished from the official store just a couple of months after being published, despite reportedly being verified. The free-to-play 2D game allegedly contained a trojan with a “cryptodrainer” program in a post-launch update that managed to seek out, find, and steal approximately $150,000 from hundreds of individual Steam users. This includes one streamer who reportedly lost over $30,000 while raising funds for their cancer treatment.
According to BleepingComputer, security researchers identified BlockBlasters as malware that seeks out and steals Steam login information along with other info. This was apparently used to find associated cryptocurrency wallet accounts and drain them. The operators seem to have targeted streamers and Twitter users specifically known to be invested in cryptocurrency with a spearphishing campaign. Reporters apparently have a US-based suspect thanks to leaked Telegram information, but there have been no arrests.
Valve has not commented on the investigation. This is the fourth high-profile example of malware making its way onto Steam and being downloaded by the general public in 2025, following similar incidents in July, March, and February.
