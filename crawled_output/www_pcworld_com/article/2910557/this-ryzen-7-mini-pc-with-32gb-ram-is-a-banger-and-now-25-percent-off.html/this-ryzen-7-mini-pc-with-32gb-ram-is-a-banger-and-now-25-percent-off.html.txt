Why spend a ton of money on a laptop when you could spend less on a mini PC that offers as good performance? Not only that, a mini PC takes up less space on your desk! It’s honestly the best choice for most people—and that choice just became easier now that this Kamrui AM21 mini PC is on sale for $499.99 (was $669.99) on Amazon. That’s a whopping $170 off on a powerful machine that’ll serve you well for years.
Let’s talk specs. This tiny little PC runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor with Zen 4 architecture and 8 cores, able to boost up to 4.9GHz for real day-to-day power. It’s bolstered by a chunky 32GB of fast DDR5 RAM and a fast 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD for responsive performance and plenty of storage space. It’s also user-upgradeable, so you can further expand it to 96GB of RAM and 4TB of storage later on.
It’s also equipped with AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics, which is powerful enough for modest gaming and graphical work like video editing. It’s also powerful enough to support quadruple 4K monitors, which you can add via dual HDMI, USB-C video, and USB4 connections. In addition, you get four high-speed USB-A, two high-speed Ethernet, and a 3.5mm audio headset jack.
That’s a lot of performance packed into a miniscule machine, and the value is insane with this discount. Get the Kamrui AM21 mini PC for just $499.99 while this deal is still on! Note that this is a Prime-exclusive deal, so you might need to start a 30-day Prime trial to score this discount.
