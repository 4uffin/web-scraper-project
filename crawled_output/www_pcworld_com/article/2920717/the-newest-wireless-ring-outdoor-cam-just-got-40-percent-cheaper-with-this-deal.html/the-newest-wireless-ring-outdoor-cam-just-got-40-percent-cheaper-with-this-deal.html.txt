You know, being able to keep an eye on my house while away is something that gives me a lot of peace of mind, so I’m sure everyone would feel the same in a similar situation. The battery-powered Ring Outdoor Cam Plus is a great option for that, especially now that it’s 40 percent off on Amazon! It’s now just $59.99 and one of the best deals to score ahead of the Prime Big Deal Days event coming up.
This is the newest model of Ring’s outdoor security camera, delivering wide-angle videos in 2K resolution. Not only will you have peace of mind that your home has surveillance, but all videos are super-high-def with crisp details, allowing you to see things like license numbers. It’s also great in the dark with color night vision even in extremely low light. Hook it up to your home Wi-Fi network and you’ll be able to check in on the video feed from anywhere via the Ring app.
What I love about this camera is that it can be mounted anywhere with just a couple of screws. It has a built-in battery that you can recharge with the included USB cable, but also supports a wired setup (if you can get it plugged into a nearby outlet) and solar-charging setup (solar panel sold separately), making it a versatile option for any home. The camera is weatherproof and built to survive most outdoor conditions.
Normally $99.99, the Ring Outdoor Cam Plus is a bargain now that it’s $59.99 with this limited-time deal. Get it while it’s on sale!
