This year’s second Prime Day event is landing in just a few weeks! Prime Big Deal Days is kicking off on October 7th and will last through the end of October 8th. Unlike July’s successful four-day sales event, this one goes back to its roots and will only last two days.
Over the last few years, we’ve seen two big Prime Day events every year with special deals and discounts for Prime members, with the first one taking place in July and the second in October. Keep reading to learn more about the Prime Big Deal Days event coming up.
When is Prime Big Deal Days in 2025?
Amazon made its official announcement on September 15th, setting the official date for the year’s second Prime Day scheduled for October 7th and 8th. This is in line with what we were expecting for Prime Big Deal Days as far as timing, mostly considering that the 2024 event took place in the same time period.
When did past Prime Days take place?
In July 2025, we saw the longest Prime Day we’ve had so far, kicking off on July 8th and lasting through July 11th. Before this summer, Amazon’s Prime Day sales event only lasted for two days. Here’s when previous Prime Day events took place:
2025: July 8th to 11th
2024: July 16th to 17th and October 8th to 9th
2023: July 11th to 12th and Oct 10th to 11th
2022: July 12th to 13th and October 11th to 12th
2021: June 21st to 22nd
2020: October 13th to 14th
How can you score deals and discounts on Prime Big Deal Days?
At its core, Prime Day events are dedicated to Amazon Prime members—think of them as one of the many perks of membership alongside free shipping. If you aren’t yet subscribed to the service, you can always start a 30-day free trial. In fact, if you start one now, the trial period will cover the upcoming October Prime Day event.
Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month (or $139 for the entire year). There are discounts available for young adults, including an extended 6-month trial period as well as a price reduction down to $7.49 per month (or $69 for the whole year). Amazon also has discounts available for qualifying government assistance recipients.
Still, while most deals will be exclusive to Prime members, non-subscribers will also get access to some great discounts.
What deals can you expect on Prime Big Deal Days?
On Prime Big Deal Days, you can expect sales on pretty much anything and everything, from shoes to laundry detergent to massive TVs. But what gets us most excited are the deals on storage solutions like SSDs, flash drives, and microSD cards, plus other goodies like ultrawide monitors, gaming laptops, Chromebooks, webcams, keyboards and mice, mini PCs, smart home devices, security cameras, and more. Amazon’s own products are also certainly going on sale, including Kindles and Echo speakers and displays, as well as its entire home security line.
Time and time again we’ve noticed Prime Day deals are better than what we get on Black Friday, so there’s no reason to wait until the end of November for things you want to go on sale.
Amazing deals to jump on before Prime Big Deal Days arrives
Prime Big Deals Days may be a few weeks away, but you can already grab some amazing deals on Amazon. Here are a few sales and discounts you should take advantage of right now:
