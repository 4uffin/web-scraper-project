I spend hours at my PC and tend to forget about anything else. In fact, it’s only after I’ve been sitting for long stints that I usually finally take stock of how my body is feeling. Often, I’ve got back pain from slouching forward in my chair. To stop that I now use an app to catch me out.
SitApp is a helpful app that uses your webcam to analyze your posture and detect when you’re slouching in real time. When you are, the app displays a pop up to tell you to sit up straight. It also tracks your posture over time so that you can see your progress over the course of the day or a week.
The app works with both sitting and standing desks and you can start and stop the monitoring with just a click of the mouse. I also really like that you’re given a percentage score of your posture, so you have something to try to beat every time you start your work.
SitApp
It’s completely private too; all the computation to detect if you are slouching happens on your computer—your webcam feed is never sent over the internet or ever available to any third party.
To get going with SitApp all you have to do is download and install the app then follow the prompts to set up your posture monitoring. It’s all free.
That’s all for this quick PC tip. For more tips like this one delivered to your inbox each week be sure to sign-up to our Try This newsletter.
