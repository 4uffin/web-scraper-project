Power banks have become a permanent fixture in my bag. You never know when your phone will die or plans will change, making it a constant companion that keeps me connected. The Baseus Picogo power bank is a solid pick for many reasons, and it’s on sale for $24.69 right now, which is 38 percent off of its $40 MSRP.
This tiny power bank fits into the palm of your hand–a definite advantage since no one wants to lug around another large device. Even better, it has a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a carrying strap, which is super handy if you take it to a concert, for example. It measures just 3.47 x 2.35 x 1.06 inches, yet still fits a tiny LED display showing remaining battery and charging power.
Speaking of which, this Baseus Picogo model can deliver up to 45W charging via the USB-C cable or port, while the USB-A port on top is limited to 22.5 W. Of course, charging multiple devices at once will lower the speeds. Its 10,000mAh capacity can recharge your phone about twice, which is something to consider.
Go ahead and order the Baseus Picogo for $24.69–this deal won’t last forever.
