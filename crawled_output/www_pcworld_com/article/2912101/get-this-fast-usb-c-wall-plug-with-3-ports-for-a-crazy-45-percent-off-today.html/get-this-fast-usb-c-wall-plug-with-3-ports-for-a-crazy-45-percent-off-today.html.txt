It sucks that new phones and tablets don’t come with charger blocks anymore, but the silver lining is you get to choose your own—and there are some really good ones that don’t cost much. Right now, this Baseus Picogo USB-C wall plug is down to $22 (was $40) on Amazon with the on-page 35% coupon and promo code TFQB2BAL at checkout.
The Baseus Picogo power adapter is perfect for smartphones, tablets, and other accessories that charge using either USB-C or USB-A. With 67 watts of charging power, it’s even fast enough for some laptops. (Baseus claims it can restore a MacBook Air to 42% in half an hour, which is pretty good for such a tiny device.) Just remember you’ll also need fast USB cables that can handle the power provided by this block.
And this is actually a 3-port charger, so you can charge multiple devices at once. With two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, it’s widely compatible with almost any device you’d need to charge. Each USB-C port is capable of the 67 watts when used alone, while the USB-A maxes out at 33 watts. But keep in mind that when two or three ports are used at once, the 67-watt total gets split between them.
What are you waiting for? Get this Baseus Picogo for only $22 with the special on-page coupon and promo code TFQB2BAL at checkout!
