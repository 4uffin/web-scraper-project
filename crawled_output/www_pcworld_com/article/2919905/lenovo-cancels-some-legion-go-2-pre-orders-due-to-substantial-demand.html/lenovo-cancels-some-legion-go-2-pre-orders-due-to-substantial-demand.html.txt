Lenovo cancels some Legion Go 2 pre-orders due to ‘substantial’ demand
According to Lenovo representatives in a Reddit AMA, orders "substantially exceeded our projections."

How many of you are just itching to drop more than a thousand bucks on a handheld gaming PC? It seems there are indeed a few, as one Lenovo representative said some Legion Go 2 pre-orders have been delayed or cancelled due to much higher demand than the company expected.
So sayeth an update to a Reddit AMA on the official Legion Go sub (spotted by Tom’s Hardware), where the representatives’ lack of response to requests on shipment times (originally scheduled for October) left posters seeing red. “The truth is pre-orders for the Legion Go Gen 2 has substantially exceeded our projections, leading to unforeseen delivery range extensions,” claims the Legion Go Team. “We will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com.”
The frustration appears to have started after some would-be Legion Go 2 buyers placed a pre-order, then saw their delivery times slip from a week or two to six weeks. Understandable, since this is a gaming device that costs $1,100 to start and stretches up to an eye-popping $1,350 for the upgraded version with an AMD Ryzen Z22 Extreme processor and other boosted specs. The Go 2 features removable controllers and an impressive OLED screen, but the price tag (equivalent to two or three Steam Decks or Switch 2s) hasn’t gone over all that well.
I also wonder how much of this is really an upswell in demand versus some behind-the-scenes error on Lenovo’s part. Pinning the issues on a huge rush to buy a new gadget would be the smart thing to say from a marketing perspective, but it’s also possible that some late-stage production or logistical errors are gumming up the works.
The Legion Go 2 is scheduled for release on October 31st, according to the Best Buy listing for the base model, which is still available to pre-order. Asus’ rival device—the ROG Xbox Ally co-branded with Microsoft—is scheduled for October 16th. It still does not have an official price.
