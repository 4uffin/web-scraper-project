ExpressVPN launches EventVPN, a free VPN service built for privacy
Apple users can now enjoy a reliable free VPN without worrying about data privacy.

ExpressVPN just announced a brand new free VPN service called EventVPN. This new service was created as a direct response to the flooding of the VPN market with low-quality free VPNs that harvest user data. It’s designed to be a safe and private alternative to these shady VPN services that put users at risk.
In a press release following the announcement, Shay Peretz, Chief Operating Officer at ExpressVPN stated, “The nature of privacy is changing materially across the world. Social media bans, censorship, and restrictions of digital accessibility are on the rise and, in many ways, have become expected. Each and every time online privacy is threatened, downloads of unsafe VPNs peak. Privacy should be a human right, not just limited to those who can pay for it with money.”
While built by ExpressVPN, using its industry-leading infrastructure, EventVPN is a fully standalone free VPN for Apple devices.
Not only does EventVPN not impose usage limits or data caps, but it also allows users to connect with one device at a time with access to over 35-plus locations. The country server selection is impressive too, with places like the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Brazil, and more.
The app even comes with many of the same advanced protections offered by ExpressVPN. These include access to its post-quantum encrypted WireGuard protocol, a kill switch feature, and an independently verified no-logs audit—a rarity among free VPNs.
The EventVPN app also includes a built-in speed test tool and in-app private browsing for nearly every major search engine.
Along with the free version, EventVPN offers a premium paid subscription plan that provides eight simultaneous device connections and access to over 125 server locations for either $10 per month or $70 for a one year term. It’s worth noting that the premium version of EventVPN and ExpressVPN are not the same and lack cross-platform compatibility. Users of EventVPN’s premium service also won’t gain access to advanced features such as Threat Manager and split-tunneling—you’ll still need to subscribe to ExpressVPN instead if you want these.
EventVPN’s free version does serve ads, although the system is built to keep user data separate from advertising services.

The free version of EventVPN does come with one big caveat: ads. And from what it looks like there are a lot of them. Every time you connect or disconnect from a server or run a speed test you’ll be served with a 30-second ad in the app.
While annoying, ads are standard fare for practically every free VPN. Only our top ranked free VPNs ProtonVPN and PrivadoVPN offer free versions without ads.
For its part, ExpressVPN has developed a system in which user data will be kept completely separate from the advertising process. In a blog post, the company explains it as such, “EventVPN uses Apple account validation and subscription receipts to check whether you’re on the free or premium plan. Once verified, you’re issued an anonymous connection token that lets you connect securely, without any personal data being stored or managed… Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) asks for permission so you can choose whether or not to receive personalized ads, and its Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) system ties ads to a unique, random device identifier, keeping your personal information private.”
I typically don’t recommend free VPNs, but there are still some that are worth your while. It remains to be seen if EventVPN will rank among the best free VPNs, but it looks promising. ExpressVPN is an outstanding service with a sterling privacy record and it is consistently one of the very best VPNs on the market. If EventVPN can provide users with a similar experience at no cost, while maintaining user privacy, then it stands to be a worthy contender.
