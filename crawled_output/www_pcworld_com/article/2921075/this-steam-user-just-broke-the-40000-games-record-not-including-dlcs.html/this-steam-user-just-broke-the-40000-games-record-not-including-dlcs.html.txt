This Steam user just broke the 40,000 games record (not including DLCs)
He's the first to unlock the rare 40,000 games badge. Here's how much his collection is worth.

There are quite a few Steam users who have accumulated huge libraries of games over their many years as gamers. It’s a meme that so many of those games remain unplayed long after being acquired, but that doesn’t seem to stop gamers from snatching up many more with every Steam sale.
But one gamer stands out. Known as SonixLegend, this user has apparently taken things to the extreme as he’s now recognized as the Steam user with the largest game library. His collection contains over 40,000 different games purchased on Steam, and Valve has even awarded him with a unique Steam badge celebrating this achievement.
Steam / SonixLegend
According to his Steam profile, SonixLegend is from Shanghai, China and has been registered on Steam for 15 years. In that time, he has amassed an impressive collection of games to become one of the few people to own more than 30,000 games on Steam. As of this week, he has officially passed the 40,000 mark and owns 40,033 titles (as of this writing).
Note that only full-fledged game titles that were actually purchased are included in this count. Free-to-play games, DLCs, and add-ons are not included. (SonixLegend also has more than 22,000 DLCs.)
Here’s how much his collection is worth
SonixLegend might just have the most valuable games library on Steam, with tracker site SteamDB estimating that his account is worth about $249,000 USD. If you were to buy all the games on his account at current prices (including discounts), it would cost over $641,000 USD.
Honestly, SonixLegend has probably never played the majority of these games—and he probably never will—making it the ultimate “pile of shame.” Still, he has completed nearly 80,000 achievements, and he was apparently fond of the free game Alien Swarm from 2010, which he spent 551 hours playing and unlocked all of its achievements.
If he continues to buy games at this rate, SonixLegend could probably cross the 50,000 games mark in a few years. At that point, Valve might have to create a new 50K badge just for him!
