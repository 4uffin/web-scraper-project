Don’t trash your Windows 10 PC yet! Microsoft might offer a trade-in value
Windows 10 users who are unable to upgrade to Windows 11 may be able to get some money out of their PCs.

Microsoft’s support for Windows 10 officially ends on October 14th, 2025, although there are ways to use Windows 10 a little while longer. With extended security updates (ESU), you can receive a year of extra updates that’ll keep you protected while you weigh your options.
There are risks to continuing use of your Windows 10 PC after end of support without getting extended updates. For some, the only real option is to upgrade to a newer PC with Windows 11—but that would mean tossing their Windows 10 PC, which isn’t ideal for the environment due to all the e-waste it would create.
Fortunately, that seems to be on Microsoft’s mind too. Apparently, some users are receiving offers from Microsoft to trade in their old Windows 10 computers. Windows Latest has reportedly discovered evidence of this trade-in program, but there’s been no official announcement of it.
In the ESU Assistant, which currently isn’t available in all countries, there’s a new path for trading in old Windows 10 PCs:

The offer apparently exists for both consumer and business devices, and it leads to the Microsoft Store where you can choose whether you want to exchange your computer for money or “recycle for good.” The latter is possible if your PC isn’t accepted for trade-in.
Whether your PC is accepted and how much you can get for trade-in value will depend on several factors, presumably including the age of your device and the hardware components in it. Microsoft obviously wants that money to be invested in new Windows 11 PCs.
