Just a few years ago, home security cameras involved lots of wiring and extra costs if you weren’t up for a DIY job. Nowadays, all you need is a drill, a ladder, and a few minutes to mount the thing to the side of your house—and it won’t even cost you much. Take this Eufy SoloCam S220 that’s on sale for just $64.98 right now (was $99.99) on Amazon!
The most impressive thing about the SoloCam S220 is that it’s both wireless and solar-powered. You can put it anywhere because you don’t need to wire it up, and it runs on continuous power thanks to the built-in solar panel on top. All it needs is an average of 3 hours of sunlight every day to stay topped up with a full battery.
It’s also wireless in the sense that it connects to your home Wi-Fi network (only the 2.4GHz band is supported). Use Eufy’s companion app to check in on the live feed and get AI-powered notifications when it detects motion. It’s even able to distinguish between friends, family, delivery people, and strangers (but you’ll need a HomeBase 3 for that).
The SoloCam S220 captures video in crisp 2560×1440 resolution, and it has an IP67 rating so it’s protected against dust, rain, snow, and other weather as it sits outside. It supports two-way audio so you can chat with whoever’s in the feed, maybe to give directions to the courier who’s dropping off your package. And the best part about Eufy’s devices? No subscription plans or monthly fees!
This is a great opportunity to get the SoloCam S220 for the lowest price it’s ever been, so don’t miss it. Snag it for just $64.98 while you still can because who knows when this limited-time deal will expire?
