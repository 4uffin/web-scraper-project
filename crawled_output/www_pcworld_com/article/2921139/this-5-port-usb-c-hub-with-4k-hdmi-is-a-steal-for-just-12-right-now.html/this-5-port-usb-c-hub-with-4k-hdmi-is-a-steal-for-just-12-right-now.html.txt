I love super-slim laptops, but the drawback to them is that they often have to sacrifice ports to get that thin. Thankfully, there’s a way to fix that and it won’t cost an arm and a leg. I’m talking about getting a USB hub, like this 5-in-1 Ugreen Revodok 105 that’s now just $11.99 on Amazon. That’s an impressive 25 percent discount on an already cheap accessory!
This is a simple 5-port hub that plugs into your laptop’s USB-C port and turns it into five: a full-sized 4K HDMI port that supports monitors with up to 30Hz of refresh, a USB-C port with up to 95W of passthrough charging (so you can keep your laptop charged while using the other ports), and three USB-A ports (one for high-speed data, two for peripherals).
USB hubs are an excellent way to expand the capabilities of your laptop on the cheap, allowing you to do so much more without any fuss. If your laptop lacks HDMI, this is a great way to add a monitor. Or effortlessly add on an external storage drive, keyboard, and mouse, which you can completely disconnect in a single move by unplugging the USB hub (useful when you take your laptop on the go), only to plug them all right back in just by reconnecting the hub. Boom!
This is a fantastic price for a simple yet tried-and-true USB hub, so get the 5-port Ugreen Revodok 105 for $11.99 before this deal sells out!
