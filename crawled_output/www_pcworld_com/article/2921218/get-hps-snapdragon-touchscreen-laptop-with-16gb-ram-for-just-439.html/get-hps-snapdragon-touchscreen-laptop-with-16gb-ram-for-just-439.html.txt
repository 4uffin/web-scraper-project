Snapdragon-powered laptops haven’t made a huge splash in the PC world—or here at PCWorld—perhaps because they’re just too expensive without a ton of extra functionality versus AMD or Intel machines. But what if you could get one for under $500? Such is the case with this HP refurbished model, which is on sale for $439 on eBay right now.
When PCWorld reviewed the HP OmniBook X AI 14 last year, Mark Knapp called it “a fine laptop offering excellent battery life,” but noted that it wasn’t worth its $1,200 asking price. But now, at just over a third of that, it looks a lot more appealing. The 14-inch 2240×1400 touchscreen is excellent and the Snapdragon X Elite processor is an upgrade over most other Qualcomm-based laptops in this price range. 16GB of RAM (the lowest I’d recommend for Windows 11) and 1TB of storage are nice, too.
At 2.95 pounds, this OmniBook is on the lighter side, especially considering the 59 watt-hour battery that can outlast bigger and more powerful designs with 18 hours of video playback. (Expect less battery life for regular work, but still more than enough to get you through an untethered work day.) The only real downside I can find with the design, other than Snapdragon’s poor gaming performance, is a lack of ports—you get only two USB-C and one USB-A on this ultra-thin design.
The eBay seller is participating in the official “eBay refurbished” program and rates this laptop as “good.” That means “used,” to be frank, but the silver lining here is that it’s been refurbished by a professional shop and comes with a 1-year Allstate warranty—much better than the usual 90 days for a refurb. If that sours you on this particular deal, check out PCWorld’s roundup of the best laptops.
