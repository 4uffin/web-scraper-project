Finally! Windows 11 24H2 won’t break your webcam or Bluetooth anymore
Now "only" three serious problems remain in Windows 11's big 24H2 update from 2024.

Ever since version 24H2 of Windows 11 was rolled out to the public last autumn, there have been persistent problems with some webcams, which, among other things, made it difficult to use facial recognition to log in with Windows Hello.
To protect users, Microsoft chose back in October 2024 to stop the upgrade to 24H2 on affected devices.
However, Bleeping Computer now reports that Microsoft has finally managed to find a solution to the problem, which means that the blocking of Windows 11 24H2 is now lifted.
And just a week ago, users of certain headphones and speakers were also given access to 24H2, after Microsoft’s developers managed to fix a Bluetooth bug.
With the new fixes, “only” three serious bugs remain with Windows 11 24H2, namely a problem with third-party wallpaper software, as well as incompatible drivers for Intel Smart Sound Technology (SST) and Senseshield Technology.
