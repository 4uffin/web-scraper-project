If you’ve been looking for a mid-range gaming laptop with one of Nvidia’s latest GPUs, things are starting to look up. Prices are coming down and deals are more common, but it’s unclear whether these drops are temporary—and if so, how soon before they skyrocket again. That’s why if you’re in the market for one, you might want to grab one ASAP in case the industry spirals out of control sooner than expected.
Right now, you can get this RTX-powered Lenovo LOQ 15IRX10 for just $1,074.99 at Best Buy, which is a hefty $225 discount for a pretty decent portable gaming machine. That 15.6-inch display sports a gorgeous IPS panel at a 1920×1080 resolution and with 144Hz of refresh, so it’ll look great whether you’re stuck reading a massive document or plowing through the latest games in your Steam library.
Performance-wise, this laptop is well-equipped to handle your daily workload and creative hobbies. It runs on a 13th-gen Intel Core i7-13650HX processor and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, which is enough to gracefully handle Windows 11 without tripping. Want more RAM? No problem. This laptop is user-upgradeable, so you can stick in another module and boost it up to 32GB. The 512GB SSD is a letdown, but shouldn’t be an issue if you can supplement with a large external drive.
But the kicker here is the RTX 5060 graphics card that unlocks access to Nvidia’s latest gaming features, including DLSS 4. It’ll run your games at high enough frame rates to take advantage of that 144Hz screen, and it’ll serve you well for years to come. You can attach an external display via HDMI or USB-C video, and you also get three USB-A ports, an Ethernet port, and a 3.5mm audio jack.
What are you waiting for? Don’t miss this chance to get the Lenovo LOQ 15IRX10 for $1,074.99 at Best Buy before supplies run out!
