By Thomas Newton								2 years ago
ReviewsAmazon Eero 6 Mesh Wi-Fi review: Fast and friendlyThe Eero 6 takes what the original system did so well, and adds rocket fuel. You get a whole-home Wi-Fi system that’s easy to install and provides robust connectivity, only this time around, top wireless speeds are faster.						By Thomas Newton								2 years ago							ReviewsAsustor Nimbustor 2 Gen2 AS5402T review: The ultimate small NASThe second generation of this NAS drive series fixes most of the things wrong with the original.						By Mark Pickavance								2 years ago							ReviewsEero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi review: More family sedan than sports carEero’s new mesh system is fast enough, reliable, and cheaper than other big mesh Wi-Fi 6E systems.						By Wes Davis								3 years ago							ReviewsNetgear Orbi 6E Mesh review: A powerful—and expensive—Wi-Fi mesh systemThis otherwise excellent router is tainted by a luxury price tag and too many subscription-only features.

By Michael Brown								6 years ago							ReviewsEero Home WiFi System 2 review: Beacons make this system even easier to installEero's Home WiFi System 2 is one of the most elegant home-networking solutions you can buy, but it’s not the fastest router.						By Michael Brown								6 years ago							ReviewsNetgear Orbi Voice review: It’s not the best smart speaker, but it’s an excellent mesh Wi-Fi systemAnd if you already have an Orbi router, it’ll make an awesome addition to your network.						By Michael Brown								6 years ago							ReviewsSeagate IronWolf 110 2.5-inch SSD: Up to 4TB of NAS storage designed to last, but a lot of cashSeagate's IronWolf 110 SSD is designed for NAS, but can also be used in PCs. Thanks to very good performance, a high durability rating, and surprisingly low premium, you might just want to do that. Being available in capacities up to 3.82 TB doesn't hurt either. 						By Jon L. Jacobi								6 years ago							ReviewsTP-Link Deco M9 Plus review: This mesh router doubles as a smart home hubThere's dedicated wireless backhaul along with Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth radios inside, but Z-Wave gets no love.

By Michael Brown								8 years ago							UpdatedSamsung Connect Home: This router/smart-home hub combo isn’t a star in either roleBut if you want one DIY platform for both networking and home control, it’s your best choice for now.
