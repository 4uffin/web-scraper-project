ReviewsAsus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG review: A dual-mode monitor that shinesThe Asus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG provides great motion clarity with solid brightness for an OLED panel, and the price is right.						By Matthew S. Smith								2 days ago							ReviewsPlugable TBT-UDT3 review: The affordable, fast Thunderbolt 5 dock I recommendPlugable's 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 (TBT-UDT3) docking station isn’t exactly cheap, but it offers a solid mix of features—including Thunderbolt Share—without a big price premium.						By Mark Hachman								2 days ago							ReviewsKingston NV3 review: Amazing real-world SSD performance for the priceWhile its synthetic benchmark numbers were strictly Gen 4, the Kingston NV3 was faster in our real-world transfers than many DRAM designs, including Gen 5 types.						By Jon Jacobi								3 days ago							ReviewsAsus Hyper M.2 x16 Gen5 review: Four slots of SSD magic — in the right PCThough limited by motherboard bifurcation capabilities (4x4x4x4 is required for all four slots to operate), the Hyper M.2 x16 is still a handy and very affordable way to add one to four PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 slots to your system. 						By Jon Jacobi								4 days ago
ReviewsLaCie Rugged SSD4 review: Fast, weatherized, and orangeThis USB4 external SSD is fast, rugged, and easy to spot on even the most cluttered desk — because it's orange!						By Jon Jacobi								6 days ago							ReviewsMSI Pro MP165 E6 review: A portable monitor you can slap on anythingThe MSI Pro MP165 E6 is a versatile option for shoppers who need a budget portable monitor that can be used with a VESA wall mount, a conventional monitor arm, or even a tripod.						By Matthew S. Smith								1 week ago							ReviewsLexar Play 2280 SE review: An attractive, fast SSD—but not on PS5The Lexar Play 2280 SE PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD is affordable and fast, but this QLC Costco-exclusive Special Edition isn't as special as its top-rated TLC Play 2280 cousin.
By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup T-Create C47 review: Mid-pack SSD but great with long writesTeamgroup's C47 PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD trailed the competition in benchmarks, but outshines many of its rivals during super-long writes						By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsSamsung 9100 PCIe 5.0 SSD review: Mighty once more! Once consistently top of the leader board, but recently an also-ran, Samsung storms back to the top with its latest NVMe SSD — the 9100 Pro.						By Jon Jacobi								3 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup X2 Max review: This SSD flash drive is a mighty miteThe size of a small commodity thumb drive, the Teamgroup
X2 Max is actually a 10Gbps powerhouse.						By Jon Jacobi								3 weeks ago							ReviewsAsus ZenScreen MB27ACF review: If you want a big portable monitor, this is itThe Asus ZenScreen MB27ACF combines a 27-inch 1440p display with the versatility of a portable monitor.						By Matthew S. Smith								3 weeks ago							ReviewsToallin Hello Pro 2K webcam review: Confusing models, mediocre performanceToallin ships a pair of Windows Hello 2K webcams, including the Hello Pro. As it turns out, the cheaper alternative that we already recommend is probably the better option.						By Mark Hachman								3 weeks ago							ReviewsWD Blue SN5100 SSD review: A worthy PCIe 4.0 successorFaster than its SN5000 predecessor by a good bit, WD's new HMB QLC SSD is priced to sell.						By Jon Jacobi								4 weeks ago							ReviewsCorsair Xeneon Edge 14.5 review: A weird monitor in all the right waysThe Corsair Xeneon Edge 14.5 is a small, versatile touchscreen monitor that can be used as a secondary display, attached to a tripod mount, or mounted inside a desktop PC.						By Matthew S. Smith								4 weeks ago							ReviewsTerraMaster D1 SSD Plus enclosure review: Fast, shiny, cool DIY storageThanks for a radically finned case design, TerraMaster's D1 external 40Gbps enclosure is fast and will never throttle due to thermal overload. We like it.						By Jon Jacobi								1 month ago							ReviewsAsus ProArt PA32QCV review: 6K monitor brings an attractive new priceThe Asus ProArt PA32QCV delivers incredible 6K sharpness at a much lower price than its predecessors. It also provides other perks, like Thunderbolt 4 connectivity and good color performance.						By Matthew S. Smith								1 month ago							ReviewsSamsung Smart Monitor M9 review: This OLED doubles as a TVThe Samsung Smart Monitor M9 is basically a 32-inch smart OLED TV, with most of the features you would expect a TV to have. That’s great if you want to stream Netflix or a cloud gaming service, but it leads to confusing menus and design quirks.						By Matthew S. Smith								1 month ago							ReviewsI switched my $180 Razer Naga for this $40 mouse—and I love itThe Solakaka SM809 has a regrettable name, but it does everything I wanted the Naga Pro to do. 						By Michael Crider								2 months ago							ReviewsAlienware AW2525HM review: A 320Hz monitor for $250! Wait, what?The Alienware AW2525HM prices refresh rate at well under a buck a hertz. That makes it a remarkable value if you want smooth, responsive PC gaming without spending a small fortune. The catch? Its image quality is just so-so.						By Matthew S. Smith								2 months ago							ReviewsViewsonic VA1655 monitor review: USB-C power comes to a budget portableThe Viewsonic VA1655 has USB-C power with 60 watts of power delivery and supports power pass-through for charging a connected laptop, but it’s thicker than the alternatives, and its image quality doesn’t beat more affordable peers.
