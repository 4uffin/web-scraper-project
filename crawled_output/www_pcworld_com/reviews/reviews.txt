ReviewsLeviton Decora Smart Motion Sensing Dimmer review: Get your move on Leviton's excellent 2nd-gen motion-sensing Wi-Fi smart dimmer (model D2MSD) can be combined with a wireless, battery-powered companion dimmer.						By Christopher Null								1 day ago							ReviewsAsus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG review: A dual-mode monitor that shinesThe Asus ROG Strix OLED XG32UCWG provides great motion clarity with solid brightness for an OLED panel, and the price is right.						By Matthew S. Smith								2 days ago							ReviewsPlugable TBT-UDT3 review: The affordable, fast Thunderbolt 5 dock I recommendPlugable's 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 (TBT-UDT3) docking station isn’t exactly cheap, but it offers a solid mix of features—including Thunderbolt Share—without a big price premium.						By Mark Hachman								2 days ago							ReviewsKingston NV3 review: Amazing real-world SSD performance for the priceWhile its synthetic benchmark numbers were strictly Gen 4, the Kingston NV3 was faster in our real-world transfers than many DRAM designs, including Gen 5 types.						By Jon Jacobi								3 days ago
ReviewsAsus Hyper M.2 x16 Gen5 review: Four slots of SSD magic — in the right PCThough limited by motherboard bifurcation capabilities (4x4x4x4 is required for all four slots to operate), the Hyper M.2 x16 is still a handy and very affordable way to add one to four PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 slots to your system. 						By Jon Jacobi								3 days ago							ReviewsPrivate Internet Access review: A low-price, high-value VPNPrivate Internet Access is a powerful, low-cost VPN that offers a good array of features, tons of customization options, and unlimited device connections.						By Sam Singleton								4 days ago							UpdatediDrive review: Excellent online backup, sharing, and moreiDrive offers online storage, sharing, file backup/sync, and more. Unless you want the functionality of an office suite, online services don't get any more comprehensive.						By Jon L. Jacobi								5 days ago							ReviewsLaCie Rugged SSD4 review: Fast, weatherized, and orangeThis USB4 external SSD is fast, rugged, and easy to spot on even the most cluttered desk — because it's orange!						By Jon Jacobi								6 days ago							ReviewsEcovacs Goat A3000 review: This mower isn't Greatest of all TimeSaddling its best robot lawn mower with the name GOAT A3000 made it all but impossible for Ecovacs to deliver the performance that badge conjures.						By Ed Oswald								1 week ago							ReviewsRazer Blade 18 review: I love this monstrous gaming laptopRazer's Blade 18 gaming laptop is a (relatively) light, quiet gaming laptop that can handle anything you want to play on it. But the battery life is horrific, and you'll probably skip over one of its key features, a dual-mode screen.						By Mark Hachman								1 week ago							ReviewsMSI Pro MP165 E6 review: A portable monitor you can slap on anythingThe MSI Pro MP165 E6 is a versatile option for shoppers who need a budget portable monitor that can be used with a VESA wall mount, a conventional monitor arm, or even a tripod.						By Matthew S. Smith								1 week ago							ReviewsRoku Streaming Stick Plus review: The sweet spot for upgradersThe $40 Roku Streaming Stick Plus delivers 4K HDR at a good price, but its software is increasingly complicated and bloated.						By Jared Newman								2 weeks ago							ReviewsLexar Play 2280 SE review: An attractive, fast SSD—but not on PS5The Lexar Play 2280 SE PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD is affordable and fast, but this QLC Costco-exclusive Special Edition isn't as special as its top-rated TLC Play 2280 cousin.
By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsSchlage Arrive Smart WiFi Deadbolt Lock review: Premium buildYou might see the Schlage Arrive Smart WiFi Deadbolt Lock's rubber buttons as a step back, but I appreciate the old-school tactile feedback they provide.						By James Barber								2 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Aspire 16 AI review: Big screen, small priceThe Acer Aspire 16 AI delivers solid CPU performance, a big screen, and a long list of features at a low price.						By Matthew S. Smith								2 weeks ago							ReviewsI bought a stylish Pomera 'writer deck' and came away disappointedThe Pomera DM250 is a device laser-focused on writing, and only writing. I only wish it had a better keyboard and a finish that matched its $500 price tag.						By Michael Crider								2 weeks ago							ReviewsRoboForm review: A simple password manager with buried flawsThis password manager provides a seamless experience—so long as you let it call all the shots. But even then, it trails rivals in security.						By Alaina Yee								2 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup T-Create C47 review: Mid-pack SSD but great with long writesTeamgroup's C47 PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD trailed the competition in benchmarks, but outshines many of its rivals during super-long writes						By Jon Jacobi								2 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 review: This 2-in-1 multitasks like a proThe Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 mixes a premium-feeling build with solid multitasking chops.						By Ashley Biancuzzo								3 weeks ago							ReviewsmyQ Doorbell Camera review: It’s a dead ringerThe inexpensive myQ Smart Garage Hub is a brilliant upgrade for garage door openers, but I won't be installing a myQ Doorbell Camera at my front door.
