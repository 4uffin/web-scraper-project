ReviewsKingston NV3 review: Amazing real-world SSD performance for the priceWhile its synthetic benchmark numbers were strictly Gen 4, the Kingston NV3 was faster in our real-world transfers than many DRAM designs, including Gen 5 types.						By Jon Jacobi								5 days ago							ReviewsAsus Hyper M.2 x16 Gen5 review: Four slots of SSD magic — in the right PCThough limited by motherboard bifurcation capabilities (4x4x4x4 is required for all four slots to operate), the Hyper M.2 x16 is still a handy and very affordable way to add one to four PCIe 5.0 NVMe M.2 slots to your system. 						By Jon Jacobi								6 days ago							ReviewsLaCie Rugged SSD4 review: Fast, weatherized, and orangeThis USB4 external SSD is fast, rugged, and easy to spot on even the most cluttered desk — because it's orange!						By Jon Jacobi								1 week ago							ReviewsLexar Play 2280 SE review: An attractive, fast SSD—but not on PS5The Lexar Play 2280 SE PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD is affordable and fast, but this QLC Costco-exclusive Special Edition isn't as special as its top-rated TLC Play 2280 cousin.

ReviewsTeamgroup T-Create C47 review: Mid-pack SSD but great with long writesTeamgroup's C47 PCIe 4.0 HMB SSD trailed the competition in benchmarks, but outshines many of its rivals during super-long writes						By Jon Jacobi								3 weeks ago							ReviewsSamsung 9100 PCIe 5.0 SSD review: Mighty once more! Once consistently top of the leader board, but recently an also-ran, Samsung storms back to the top with its latest NVMe SSD — the 9100 Pro.						By Jon Jacobi								3 weeks ago							ReviewsTeamgroup X2 Max review: This SSD flash drive is a mighty miteThe size of a small commodity thumb drive, the Teamgroup
X2 Max is actually a 10Gbps powerhouse.						By Jon Jacobi								3 weeks ago							ReviewsWD Blue SN5100 SSD review: A worthy PCIe 4.0 successorFaster than its SN5000 predecessor by a good bit, WD's new HMB QLC SSD is priced to sell.						By Jon Jacobi								4 weeks ago							ReviewsTerraMaster D1 SSD Plus enclosure review: Fast, shiny, cool DIY storageThanks for a radically finned case design, TerraMaster's D1 external 40Gbps enclosure is fast and will never throttle due to thermal overload. We like it.						By Jon Jacobi								1 month ago							ReviewsAsus TUF Gaming A2 review: This SSD enclosure is fast and built like a tankAsus's TUF Gaming A2 USB 3.2×2 NVMe SSD enclosure with an IP68 rating has earned a permanent place in my backpack. 						By Jon Jacobi								2 months ago							ReviewsPNY Duo Link V3 review: A versatile USB flash drive for light-duty useFor everyday data transfer, the dual-connector PNY Duo Link V3 is tops. For heavy workloads — it's by far the slowest SSD we've ever tested.						By Jon Jacobi								2 months ago							ReviewsHighPoint 7604A RAID card review: Up to 32TB of blisteringly-fast storageWant 50GBps of sequential performance? HighPoint's 7604A
x16 PCIe 5.0 NVMe RAID card sporting four full-speed M.2 slots can deliver it — for a rather hefty amount of coin.						By Jon Jacobi								2 months ago							ReviewsLexar NM1090 Pro SSD review: Fast overall, but slower among peersThough hardly slow, the Lexar NM1090 Pro couldn't quite match the performance of its like-priced PCIe 5.0/DRAM design rivals						By Jon Jacobi								3 months ago							ReviewsCrucial T710 review: Another PCIe 5.0 SSD stunner from CrucialSlightly faster than the Crucial's own highly-rated T705 in most benchmarks, the T710 can run with the best of them and is available with a very beefy heaksink						By Jon Jacobi								3 months ago							ReviewsCrucial X10 review: A killer portable SSD that's tiny, fast, and weatherproofWe love this tiny, weatherproofed drive's overall performance and that it can fit 8TB of storage in such a small form-factor. We do, however, wish it was USB4 rather than USB 3.2×2.						By Jon Jacobi								3 months ago							ReviewsLexar NQ780 review: An affordable SSD with a kickA very good host memory buffer PCIe 4.0 performer, the Lexar NQ780 also features that fastest native-writing QLC NAND we've yet seen.						By Jon Jacobi								3 months ago							ReviewsOrico IG740-Pro SSD review: An okay performer with cool extrasThough not a standout performer, the Orico IG740-Pro is fast enough, decently affordable, and ships with some nice-to-have extras.						By Jon Jacobi								3 months ago							ReviewsPNY CS2342 review: An awesome teeny-tiny SSD for your Steam DeckThough not the 2230 SSD (think Steam Deck) you want for long writes, the PNY CS2342 is killer for everyday tasks.						By Jon Jacobi								4 months ago							ReviewsXPG Mars 980 Blade SSD review:
This is the SSD you want to run your OS from The oddly named Adata XPG Mars 980 Blade, PCIe 5.0 NVMe SSD set new records in CrystalDiskMark 8's random tests. It wasn't shoddy in other areas, either.						By Jon Jacobi								4 months ago							ReviewsAddlink P21 review: This affordable, portable 20Gbps SSD looks great, but is cheaply madeGood 20Gbps performance and a striking design are Addlink’s formula for this external SSD. But it didn't stand up well physically over time						By Jon Jacobi								4 months ago							1
