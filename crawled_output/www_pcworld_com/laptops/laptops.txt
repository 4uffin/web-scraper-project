ReviewsHP EliteBook 8 Flip G1i review: A well-designed 2-in-1 with smart pen storageThe HP EliteBook 8 Flip G1i has the best pen storage I've seen on a laptop, and it has a premium metal chassis and thoughtful design. But the display specs are below par, and this laptop isn't as long-lasting as Intel Lunar Lake-powered systems.						By Chris Hoffman								14 hours ago							ReviewsHP EliteBook 8 G1a review: AMD's hardware shinesThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a Copilot+ PC with an excellent mix of CPU performance and battery life. It's a solid package, but the display drags down the experience, and the GPU just can't keep up with the rest of the hardware.						By Chris Hoffman								3 days ago							ReviewsPlugable TBT-UDT3 review: The affordable, fast Thunderbolt 5 dock I recommendPlugable's 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 (TBT-UDT3) docking station isn’t exactly cheap, but it offers a solid mix of features—including Thunderbolt Share—without a big price premium.						By Mark Hachman								1 week ago							ReviewsRazer Blade 18 review: I love this monstrous gaming laptopRazer's Blade 18 gaming laptop is a (relatively) light, quiet gaming laptop that can handle anything you want to play on it. But the battery life is horrific, and you'll probably skip over one of its key features, a dual-mode screen.

By Matthew S. Smith								3 weeks ago							ReviewsI bought a stylish Pomera 'writer deck' and came away disappointedThe Pomera DM250 is a device laser-focused on writing, and only writing.

By Michael Crider								3 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 review: This 2-in-1 multitasks like a proThe Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 mixes a premium-feeling build with solid multitasking chops.						By Ashley Biancuzzo								3 weeks ago							ReviewsLenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 review: Greatness at every turnIf you want a laptop that exudes greatness everywhere you look, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 Aura Edition is it. From brilliant performance in its class and respectable battery life to a brilliant display and solid design, this machine makes the price tag seem reasonable.
