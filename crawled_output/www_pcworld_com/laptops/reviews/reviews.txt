ReviewsHP EliteBook 8 G1a review: AMD's hardware shinesThe HP EliteBook 8 G1a is a Copilot+ PC with an excellent mix of CPU performance and battery life. It's a solid package, but the display drags down the experience, and the GPU just can't keep up with the rest of the hardware.						By Chris Hoffman								2 days ago							ReviewsPlugable TBT-UDT3 review: The affordable, fast Thunderbolt 5 dock I recommendPlugable's 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 (TBT-UDT3) docking station isn’t exactly cheap, but it offers a solid mix of features—including Thunderbolt Share—without a big price premium.						By Mark Hachman								6 days ago							ReviewsRazer Blade 18 review: I love this monstrous gaming laptopRazer's Blade 18 gaming laptop is a (relatively) light, quiet gaming laptop that can handle anything you want to play on it. But the battery life is horrific, and you'll probably skip over one of its key features, a dual-mode screen.						By Mark Hachman								2 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Aspire 16 AI review: Big screen, small priceThe Acer Aspire 16 AI delivers solid CPU performance, a big screen, and a long list of features at a low price.						By Matthew S. Smith								2 weeks ago
ReviewsI bought a stylish Pomera 'writer deck' and came away disappointedThe Pomera DM250 is a device laser-focused on writing, and only writing. I only wish it had a better keyboard and a finish that matched its $500 price tag.						By Michael Crider								3 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 review: This 2-in-1 multitasks like a proThe Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 mixes a premium-feeling build with solid multitasking chops.						By Ashley Biancuzzo								3 weeks ago							ReviewsLenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 review: Greatness at every turnIf you want a laptop that exudes greatness everywhere you look, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 Gen 10 Aura Edition is it. From brilliant performance in its class and respectable battery life to a brilliant display and solid design, this machine makes the price tag seem reasonable.						By Mark Knapp								3 weeks ago							ReviewsHP OmniBook 5 14 review: Over 25 hours of battery powerThe HP OmniBook 5 14 isn’t the quickest laptop, but its lightweight form factor and long battery life will surely woo you.						By Matthew S. Smith								4 weeks ago							ReviewsAcer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI review: An OLED stealThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI feels like it was meant to be a gaming laptop and the marketing department wanted to slap "AI" on it. It's a reasonable midrange gaming laptop with a stunning OLED display. If you want AI laptop features, though — look elsewhere. 						By Chris Hoffman								1 month ago							ReviewsMaingear Ultima 18 review: Over-the-top power, old-school designThe Maingear Ultima 18 is a brick of a gaming laptop. The internals are impressive, but it isn't quite as polished an experience as some other modern gaming laptops.						By Chris Hoffman								1 month ago							ReviewsDell 14 Premium review: Power first, portability secondThe Dell 14 Premium might have a 14-inch display, but it’s focused more on premium design and performance than on portability. 						By Matthew S. Smith								1 month ago							ReviewsLenovo ThinkPad T14s review: Twice the price, but not twice as niceI had high hopes for the Intel ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, but its performance is held back by poor cooling and significantly reduced battery life. It might have been worth recommending if it weren’t nearly twice the price of the Snapdragon model.						By Mark Knapp								1 month ago							ReviewsLenovo Legion 5i review: Great performance, confusing pricingThe Lenovo Legion 5i 15IRX10 pairs an excellent display with solid internals for a great gaming experience. With a $1,199 price tag on a configuration close to our test unit, the value looks good. Just avoid Lenovo’s unnavigable first-party pricing.
By Mark Knapp								1 month ago							ReviewsLenovo ThinkBook Plus Rollable review: The sci-fi laptop you can actually buyThe world's first laptop unrolls extra screen real estate from below the keyboard at the push of a button. It works well, and the tradeoffs are all worth it if you want a rollable display. If the sticker price doesn't faze you, you'll love it.						By Chris Hoffman								2 months ago							ReviewsLenovo Yoga Book 9i review: A dual-screen powerhouse built for flexibilityThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is a unique Windows 2-in-1. Though it’s okay as a laptop, and can also be used as a tablet, it’s perhaps best understood as a portable all-in-one. 						By Matthew S. Smith								2 months ago							ReviewsAlienware 16 Aurora review: Budget specs at a mid-tier priceThe Alienware 16 Aurora is the lowest-end model in Alienware's laptop lineup. With a lower-end display and a slower CPU, the price just feels too high for this experience.						By Chris Hoffman								2 months ago							ReviewsLenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 review: Mediocre performance meets high priceThe Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 16 Gen 10 is a functional machine with decent CPU performance, but that’s the bare minimum even a $300 laptop should meet—and beyond its too-high price tag, there’s just nothing to get excited about.						By Mark Knapp								2 months ago							ReviewsAlienware 16X Aurora review: Out of this world valueThe Alienware 16X Aurora has a high-end CPU, a fast GPU, and a beautiful display. You'd have a hard time finding comparable hardware at this price.						By Chris Hoffman								2 months ago							ReviewsAsus Chromebook CX15 review: Get the basics for under $200The Asus Chromebook CX15 offers just the basics—and nothing more—for under $200.   						By Matthew S. Smith								2 months ago							ReviewsHP EliteBook X G1i review: Sleek, efficient, overpricedThe HP EliteBook X G1i is a solid laptop offering modest performance, strong battery life, and an easy-viewing display, but the premium for all the business features severely limits its audience, and HP’s chaotic pricing doesn’t help.
