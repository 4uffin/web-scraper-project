ReviewsPrivate Internet Access review: A low-price, high-value VPNPrivate Internet Access is a powerful, low-cost VPN that offers a good array of features, tons of customization options, and unlimited device connections.						By Sam Singleton								5 days ago							UpdatediDrive review: Excellent online backup, sharing, and moreiDrive offers online storage, sharing, file backup/sync, and more. Unless you want the functionality of an office suite, online services don't get any more comprehensive.						By Jon L. Jacobi								6 days ago							ReviewsRoboForm review: A simple password manager with buried flawsThis password manager provides a seamless experience—so long as you let it call all the shots. But even then, it trails rivals in security.						By Alaina Yee								2 weeks ago							ReviewsTrend Micro Maximum Security review: Better alternatives existUnderwhelming features, weak antivirus protection, and potentially showstopping bugs tank Trend Micro Maximum Security's appeal.						By Alaina Yee								4 weeks ago
ReviewsAvira Prime review: Comprehensive, user-friendly antivirusAvira Prime is a simple, easy-to-understand antivirus suite that includes numerous features.						By Alaina Yee								1 month ago							ReviewsSurfshark review: An affordable VPN service packed with featuresSurfshark is a leading VPN service for good reason. It offers unlimited device connections, works with Netflix, and comes with a ton of extras such as built-in antivirus and multihop functionality.						By Sam Singleton								1 month ago							ReviewsESET Home Security Premium review: Simple protection with a complex heartESET's antivirus software gives far more control over scan and feature settings than the average rival — a plus for power users — without being intimidating.						By Alaina Yee								1 month ago							ReviewsCyberLink Photo Director 365 review: Smarter photo editing with AICyberLink Photo Director 365 offers numerous generative AI tools for photo editing and enhancement. We test whether they deliver convincing results.						By Jörn-Erik Burkert								1 month ago							ReviewsAomei Backupper Standard review: Surprisingly good free backup and restoreIf you don't mind an ad here and there, this more-than-capable standard version of Aomei Backupper will meet most users' needs for zero coin. Can't argue with that. 						By Jon Jacobi								1 month ago							ReviewsDitch Windows Explorer! These programs are better for fast file transfers!SSDs can top 15GBps these days. However, Windows Explorer can't get much past 3GBps. Xcopy or FastCopy allow you to realize the true potential of your NVMe storage and save you time when copying large amounts of data.						By Jon Jacobi								1 month ago							ReviewsBackup and Restore (Windows 7) review: Good for imaging, bad for disaster recoveryThere's a well-hidden feature in Windows called "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" that will image your storage drives to the highly compatible VHDX format. Alas, creating boot media is arduous, it's unreliable, and limitations spoil it as a recipe for disaster recovery.						By Jon Jacobi								1 month ago							ReviewsOysterVPN review: The new kid on the VPN blockNewcomer OysterVPN stands its ground against some heavy competition thanks to its easy-to-use app and affordable pricing.						By Sam Singleton								1 month ago							UpdatedMcAfee Total Protection review: Top security undermined by a major featureMcAfee Total Protection offers strong antivirus, network, and online protection, but its password manager needs improvement.						By Alaina Yee								1 month ago							ReviewsAvast One review: Polished PC security with excellent protectionAvast One defends not just your PC from online threats, but you as well—and does so by going beyond just superb antivirus protection.						By Alaina Yee								2 months ago							ReviewsRetrospect 19 Solo review: Good backup, but where's the disaster recovery?This entry-level version of a famed backup program will ward off ransomware attacks on your backups and now supports backup to the cloud. But there's no disaster recovery and several other features found in the pricier Desktop version are missing.						By Jon Jacobi								2 months ago							ReviewsNorton Antivirus Plus review: Fantastic security for digital minimalistsNorton Antivirus Plus provides solids basics of online protection without any extra fluff—ideal for those avoiding unnecessary, expensive excess.						By Alaina Yee								2 months ago							ReviewsBitdefender Total Security review: Great, easy to use protectionBitdefender offers superb antivirus and malware defense, but this mid-tier security suite is oddly stingy in a key regard: VPN support.						By Alaina Yee								2 months ago							ReviewsAVG Internet Security review: Reliable, budget-friendly antivirus softwareAVG Internet Security is a good upgrade on its free antivirus software, especially if you need broader online protection and don’t want to pay a lot for it.						By Alaina Yee								2 months ago							ReviewsAomei Backupper Professional review: All-in-one backup, now with online storageAs of version 7, Aomei Backupper Professional can compete with the best imaging, backup, and sync programs out there in terms of specs and features. It's also a solid performer — with some rough edges.						By Jon L. Jacobi								2 months ago							ReviewsRetrospect Desktop review: Reliable backup, cloud storage, and moreOne of the most configurable and effective backup programs on the market, Retrospect wards off ransomware damage to your backups and now supports backup to the cloud.
