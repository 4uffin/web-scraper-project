ReviewsKeychron K2 HE review: Fast, precise, and versatile magnetic switchesThe Keychron K2 HE gaming keyboard features magnetic switches, Rapid Trigger technology, and 1,000 Hz wireless, but offers only a few switch options and no volume wheel.

By Mattias Inghe								4 weeks ago							ReviewsI switched my $180 Razer Naga for this $40 mouse—and I love itThe Solakaka SM809 has a regrettable name, but it does everything I wanted the Naga Pro to do. 						By Michael Crider								2 months ago							ReviewsNintendo Switch 2 review: A worthwhile upgrade, just not a big leapThe Nintendo Switch 2 is a smart upgrade with better graphics and faster load times, but its weaker battery, LCD screen, and high price suit hardcore fans more than casual players.						By Laura Pippig								3 months ago
ReviewsClair Obscur: Expedition 33 review: A dazzling descent into fantasy and fateThe role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a surprise hit thanks not only to its stunning visuals but also its compelling story and challenging gameplay.						By Laura Pippig								5 months ago							ReviewsAsus ROG Delta II review: Premium sound but cumbersome ear padsThe Asus ROG Delta II offers good sound and interesting functions, but is less suitable for small heads. 						By Eugen Wegmann								6 months ago							ReviewsThe Spectrum review: Relive the ZX Spectrum's 80s gaming gloriesThe Spectrum faithfully recreates the 80s original with its rubber keys and classic games, delighting older gamers, while younger players may face a steep learning curve due to tricky controls and tough gameplay. However, modern features like save and rewind help mitigate that frustration.						By Ida Blix								6 months ago							ReviewsCorsair Platform:4 review: A modular desk with powerful featuresThanks to its modular design, the Corsair Platform:4 work and gaming desk can be flexibly customised. We tested the Elevate model with electric height adjustment.						By Friedrich Stiemer								7 months ago							ReviewsAsus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) review: A gaming tablet outclassed by its rivalsThe Asus ROG Flow Z13 (2025) integrates AMD's Ryzen AI Max processor, a graphics and AI powerhouse. But are you willing to pay hundreds more for a gaming tablet that doesn't quite offer what a traditional gaming laptop does?						By Mark Hachman								7 months ago							ReviewsRazer Freyja review: This haptic seat pad (literally) shakes up your gamingThe Razer Freyja cushion delivers intense haptic feedback, enhancing immersion for gamers, music lovers, and film fans with its customizable zones and impressive "audio-to-haptics" function. Although it's expensive, we feel it's a worthwhile investment for those looking for deeper immersion.

By Brad Chacos and Adam Patrick Murray								7 months ago							ReviewsNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 review: A stagnant 'upgrade' but an okay GPUNvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 is virtually identical to the RTX 4070 Super it replaces, but with a dash of DLSS 4's Multi-Frame Gen magic. 						By Brad Chacos								7 months ago							ReviewsNvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti review: DLSS turns a beastly GPU into a gaming monsterNvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is basically a 4080 Super on DLSS 4 steroids. It's great. 						By Brad Chacos								7 months ago							ReviewsLenovo Legion Go S review: Not quite the bargain we hoped forThe Lenovo Legion Go S is an incredibly ergonomic handheld gaming PC that feels great in your hands, but Windows makes the whole experience feel awkward. 						By Chris Hoffman								7 months ago							ReviewsKeychron B1 Pro review: This lil keyboard beats Logitech in features and priceKeychron's B1 Pro punches way above its price tag, offering comparable features and performance to the Logitech MX Keys and Apple Magic Keyboard. 						By Michael Crider								8 months ago							ReviewsNvidia GeForce RTX 5080 review: Betting the future on 'fake frames'The GeForce RTX 5080 offers negligible improvement over the 4080 Super's performance — but also a truly game-changing feature in DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.						By Brad Chacos and Adam Patrick Murray								8 months ago							ReviewsCooler Master MK770 review: Perfect for gamers and typists alikeThe Cooler Master MK770 keyboard is based on a hybrid concept with wireless and wired connectivity and high-quality mechanical switches. 						By Friedrich Stiemer								8 months ago							ReviewsNvidia GeForce RTX 5090 review: Brutally fast, but DLSS 4 is the game changerNvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 is the most brutally fast graphics card ever introduced, augmented by new DLSS 4 technology that feels like magic. But you pay dearly for it.						By Brad Chacos and Adam Patrick Murray								8 months ago							ReviewsNuphy Air60 HE review: This sleek magnetic keyboard is a joy to useThis low-profile board is oozing with gamer style, but here's a surprise: It's also the best skinny board I've ever used for typing. 						By Michael Crider								9 months ago							ReviewsIntel Arc B580 review: The GPU we've begged for since the pandemicIntel’s $249 Arc B580 is the graphics card we’ve begged for since the pandemic.
