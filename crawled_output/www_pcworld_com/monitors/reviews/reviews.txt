ReviewsAsus ProArt PA32QCV review: 6K monitor brings an attractive new priceThe Asus ProArt PA32QCV delivers incredible 6K sharpness at a much lower price than its predecessors.

By Matthew S. Smith								2 months ago							ReviewsAcer Predator SpatialLabs View 27 monitor review: Glasses-free 3D on your desktopAcer’s Predator SpatialLabs View 27 delivers convincing and enjoyable glasses-free 3D. But a limited list of compatible games, visual glitches, and a high MSRP make the monitor a novelty at best.
By Matthew S. Smith								3 months ago							ReviewsDell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED review: Undercuts its peers on price and portsThe Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED delivers great image quality, solid audio, and good motion clarity, yet undercuts most competitive 32-inch 4K OLED monitors on price.

Smith								3 months ago							ReviewsLG Ultragear 39GX90SA-W review: This huge OLED monitor packs TV smartsThe LG Ultragear 39GX90SA-W is a gigantic 39-inch ultrawide monitor that can double as a smart television, for better and for worse.						By Matthew S. Smith								3 months ago							ReviewsArzopa Z1FC review: This budget portable monitor can game, and moreThe Arzopa Z1FC is billed as a “portable gaming monitor,” but it’s actually a solid choice for anyone who needs an affordable portable display.

By Matthew S. Smith								5 months ago							ReviewsDell Pro 34 Plus USB-C review: A pricey ultrawide monitor built for workThe Dell Pro 34 Plus USB-C is a decent choice if you want an ultrawide with lots of connectivity, but the monitor’s image quality fails to impress. 						By Matthew S. Smith								5 months ago							ReviewsAsus ProArt PA32UCDM review: A 4K OLED monitor for creative prosThe Asus ProArt PA32UCDM delivers excellent OLED image quality and high refresh rates, though limited connectivity holds it back. 						By Matthew S. Smith								5 months ago							ReviewsLG Ultragear 45GX950A-B review: This monitor will wow you (and cost you)The LG Ultragear 45GX950A-B’s high price and extreme curve will turn off some, but it’s hard to argue with its sharpness and HDR performance.
