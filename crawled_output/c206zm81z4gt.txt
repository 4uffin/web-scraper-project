Image source, Getty ImagesBorn in a suburb of Chicago in 1993, Charlie Kirk got started early in conservative politics, first penning an essay for right-wing Breitbart News at the age of 18, accusing schools of spreading "propaganda" and "indoctrination". He caught the eye of Bill Montgomery, a retired businessman and Tea Party activist more than 50 years his senior, who took Kirk under his wing.In 2012 â around the midpoint of Barack Obama's presidency â the pair founded Turning Point USA, a group which focused on conservative activism on college campuses, spreading rapidly along with Kirk's social media following.The group tapped into online media and spread a slickly packaged style of conservatism to young people. It won him a speaking place, aged 22, at the 2016 Republican National Convention.Kirk's political views drifted rightward over time. He was against gay marriage and abortion, argued for Christian nationalism and was highly critical of Islam, and famously said that gun deaths were "worth it" for the right to own firearms. He was also an opponent of diversity programmes and spread falsehoods about topics such as Covid vaccines and voting fraud.Above all, he was loyal to Trump.

Weâve been listening
back to Wednesday's episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, released just hours
before he was killed.The
31-year-old covered a range of
right-wing talking points that have been driving the week's political agenda,
including some which Trump and the White House have repeatedly drawn attention
to. They included ICE deportations in Chicago, the murder of a Ukrainian
refugee and what Kirk called the "ever-increasing amount of black
crime".During a discussion with
a Department of Homeland Security official early in the podcast, Kirk said city
mayors who do not co-operate with federal ICE raids should be "in
jail".On the show,
he also made the false claim that George Floyd, who was murdered by a white
police officer in 2020, had died of an "overdose".In one segment, Kirk
discussed the
murder of Iryna
Zarutska, and claimed "empirical" data showed
that "black people killing white people" was the "most common
race-based hate attack" in America."See the left, they
donât like it when I say things like this. But Iâm sorry," he said.According to the latest FBI crime data, external,
10,805 hate crimes were reported in the US in the past year, with 2,872 against
black people, while 847 were recorded as "anti-white".
