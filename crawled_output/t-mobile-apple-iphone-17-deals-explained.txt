As usual, the best way to score a deal on these new phones is through your preferred service provider. T-Mobile, now the best mobile network in the US (according to Ookla® Speedtest®), is already advertising a couple of promotions in advance, including excellent trade-in values on older iPhone models. If you're porting your number over from another service, then you may not even need to trade in your existing phone.Get up to $1,100 off the New Apple iPhone 17 Pro with Trade-InPRESENTED BY:T-MobileUp to $1,100 Off the New Apple iPhone 17 Pro With Eligible Trade-in and Service Activation31See it at T-MobileStarting Friday, September 12, you'll be able to preorder a brand new Apple iPhone 17 Pro at T-Mobile and score up to $1,100 off in trade-in credit when you sign up for a new line on the Experience Beyond plan with AutoPay.

Note that other phones may also be eligible, but if that's the case, their values haven't been advertised yet:iPhone 13 Pro - $1100 trade-in valueiPhone 12 Pro - $830 trade-in valueiPhone 6 - $550 trade-in valueThe discount is applied in the form of 24 monthly bill credits.

If you're looking to purchase an iPhone 7 and don't expect to replace it in a year or two, the Metro by T-Mobile BYOD plan might end up being the best choice for you.The Metro by T-Mobile plan offers one line of unlimited talk, text, and 5G data for $30 for the first month and $25 per month afterwards with AutoPay. Taxes and fees are already included. You're guaranteed this price for 5 years, although being a prepaid plan, you're free to opt out at any time. In addition, you get perks like Scam Shield, which enables Caller ID and blocks or redirects spam calls, and T-Mobile Tuesdays, a program that gives you access to freebies and exclusive discounts every Tuesday. Note that speeds may slow if you go over a soft cap of greater than 35GB per month.
The Metro plan only costs $25 per month, compared to $85 for the Experience More plan and $100 for the Experience Beyond plan. That's a difference of $60-$70 every month on your phone bill. If you hold onto your phone for 3 years, you're saving $2,160 to $2,520 on your bill. That's plenty of savings to afford your next iPhone upgrade down the line.Note that some exclusions apply.
