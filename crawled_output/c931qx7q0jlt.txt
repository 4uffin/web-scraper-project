West Ham were gifted the lead within five minutes when Arsenal goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar spilled a cross from Shekiera Martinez, fumbling the ball on to the post before it rebounded off the Netherlands international for an own goal. Arsenal levelled midway through the first half through Norway striker Maanum, who slotted home from close range following Beth Mead's third assist of the campaign.Renee Slegers' side took the lead six minutes into the second half when Blackstenius, a half-time substitute for Maanum, curled a left-footed effort into the bottom corner following a fine lay-off from England forward Russio.After having a goal ruled out for offside, Foord then gave the Gunners a two-goal cushion when the Australian headed in on her 100th WSL appearance from Mariona Caldentey's corner. Former Manchester United forward Russo smashed home Arsenal's fourth with an excellent right-footed finish into the top corner, before converting a penalty in injury time when Olivia Smith was upended by Ines Belloumou. Analysis: Arsenal continue flying start against lacklustre HammersArsenal couldn't have made a much better start to the season.Two wins, nine goals scored and only two conceded - and it would have been a clean sheet against the Hammers but for an error from Van Domselaar.For the second consecutive week, the Gunners conceded first, and though the sample size is small, it's an early worrying sign for manager Slegers.Though that could prove costly against stronger opposition, the Gunners had more than enough firepower to comeback against a West Ham side that lacked the confidence an early opener should have given them. Russo, playing in front of an entirely different attacking midfield three from the one used in last week's 4-1 win against the London City Lionesses, looked set to end the night without the goal that her play deserved.The England ace was the perfect foil for Maanum and Foord, holding the ball up, running the line and bringing others into play. But for all of her great work, chances were in short supply as the 30-year-old looked for her first WSL goal of the campaign. Until injury time, at least.Russo's first came when she blasted into the top corner from the edge of the box and she had to wait less than three minutes for her second when she slotted a spot-kick.The Player Rater cannot be displayed in your browser.
