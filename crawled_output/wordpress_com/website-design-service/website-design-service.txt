Website design service FAQ
Get started
Who is the website design service for?
Whether you’re launching a new venture or ready to take your existing online presence to the next level, our website design service will expertly transform your vision and goals into a unique and powerful website perfect for your brand or business.
How does it work?
Pick the service that best aligns with your goals and needs. From there, we’ll guide you through a step-by-step process to understand your vision and then we’ll bring it to life by designing and building your custom website.
Are revisions included?
Our Custom Development service includes rounds of revisions. Revisions are not included in the Express and Express Store options. Whichever option you go with, once you’ve received your completed site, you’re free to modify everything with the WordPress editor—colors, text, images, adding new pages, and anything else you’d like to tweak.
Where is my website hosted?
Express sites will be hosted on WordPress.com. With 99.999% uptime, lightning-fast site speeds all over the world, automatic WordPress updates, and a range of advanced security features. There’s no better place to host, build, and grow your site. For custom sites, our agency partners will comprehensively assess your site’s requirements and propose the most suitable hosting options tailored to your business needs.
Do I own my website after the work is completed?
Yes, the website is yours once it’s finished. You’ll be able to add and edit copy, images, and more, directly from the WordPress Admin Dashboard.
Do you offer a maintenance package?
When you opt for a custom development approach for your website, you unlock the opportunity to purchase additional, comprehensive maintenance plans from our agency partners. These are not available with our Express plans but can be a valuable asset for custom solutions that may require continued attention. Maintenance packages are tailored to support your evolving needs—covering everything from expanded functionality with additional pages to regular code updates, as well as plugin configurations, and more.
What does my Express Store setup include?
Your purchase includes the setup of the WooCommerce shop landing page, cart, checkout, and My Account pages, along with additional pages you choose while signing up. Please note that individual product setup, payments, taxes, shipping, and other WooCommerce extensions or settings are not included. You can set these up later, and our Support team is happy to help if you have any questions.
Can I use my existing domain name?
Yes, our Support team will help you connect your existing domain name to your site after the build is complete.
