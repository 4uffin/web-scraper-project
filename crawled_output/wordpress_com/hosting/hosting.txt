Everything you need to know about hosting.

Can I import content from another service?
It is possible to move your blog content from a variety of other blogging platforms, including GoDaddy, Wix, Squarespace, and more. You can also easily import your content from a self-hosted WordPress site.
Are traffic and bandwidth really unlimited?
Absolutely, and you will never be hit with any surprise usage fees. With
WordPress.com, you’ll be hosted on our infinitely scalable and globally
distributed server infrastructure, which means your site will always be available
and load fast, no matter how popular your site becomes.
Can I use a domain I already own?
Yes! You can connect your domain for free to any WordPress.com paid plan (we won’t charge you a separate
domain registration fee). You may either keep the domain at your current registrar or transfer it to us, whichever you
prefer.
Can I host multiple sites?
Yes, you can host as many sites as you like, but they each need a separate plan. You can choose the appropriate plan for each site individually so you’ll pay
for only the features you need. We have a dashboard that helps you
manage all your WordPress.com and Jetpack-connected websites, all from one simple
and centralized admin tool.
What is your refund policy?
If you aren’t satisfied with our product, you can cancel anytime within the refund
period for a prompt and courteous refund, no questions asked. The refund
timeframes are:
14 days for annual WordPress.com plans
7 days for monthly WordPress.com plans
96 hours for new domain registrations
I want to transfer an existing site, will purchasing a plan now break it?
No it won’t! You’re welcome to create your new site with us before pointing the domain here. That way your current site can stay “live” until your new one is ready. We recommend getting a plan now because they have other features you might find useful, including priority 24/7 support from our experts. Just avoid using the domain options until you’re ready, and then you can connect or transfer the domain.
Can I get an email account?
Absolutely! We offer a few different options to meet your needs. For most customers, our Professional Email service is the smart choice. This robust hosted email solution is available
for any domain hosted with WordPress.com. We also offer a Google Workspace integration, and for users who need something simpler, you can set up email
forwarding for free.
Can I install plugins?
Yes! On Business or Commerce plans, you’ll be able to search for and install over 50,000 available plugins in the WordPress repository.
Can I install my own theme?
Yes! All plans give you access to our directory of free and premium themes that have been handpicked and reviewed for quality by our team. With the
WordPress.com Business or
Commerce plan, you can upload and
install any theme you’d like.
Can you build a site for me?
We sure can! If you need a hand launching your website, take a look at Built By
WordPress.com Express, our white glove site setup service. Our in-house experts
will create your site, and you’ll be ready to go live in four business days or
less. To learn more,

Can I talk to a live person?
We’d love to talk with you! All paid plans include access to one-on-one support from our team of WordPress experts (we call them Happiness Engineers).
