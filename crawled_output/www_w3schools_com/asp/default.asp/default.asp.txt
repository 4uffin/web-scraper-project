ASP stands for Active Server Pages
ASP is a development framework for building web pages.
ASP supports many different development models:
Classic ASP
ASP.NET Web Forms
ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET Web Pages
ASP.NET API
ASP.NET Core
The ASP Technology
ASP and ASP.NET are server side technologies.
Both technologies enable computer code to be executed by an Internet server.
When a browser requests an ASP or ASP.NET file, the ASP engine reads the file, executes
any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser.
Classic ASP - Active Server Pages
ASP (aka Classic ASP) was introduced in 1998
as Microsoft's first server side scripting language.
Classic ASP pages have the file extension .asp and are normally written in VBScript.
Visit our Classic ASP Tutorial »
ASP.NET
ASP.NET was released in 2002 as a successor to Classic ASP.
ASP.NET pages have the extension .aspx and are normally written in C# (C sharp).
ASP.NET 4.6 is the latest official version of ASP.NET.
ASP.NET 5 was expected to be an important redesign of ASP.NET.
However, the development of ASP.NET 5 was stopped in favor of
ASP.NET Core.
ASP.NET Web Pages
ASP.NET Web Pages is an SPA application model (Single Page Application).
The SPA model is quite similar to PHP and Classic ASP.
ASP.NET Web Pages is being merged into the new ASP.NET Core.
Visit our Web Pages Tutorial »
ASP.NET MVC
ASP.NET MVC is an MVC application model (Model-View-Controller).
ASP.NET MVC is being merged into the new ASP.NET Core.
ASP.NET MVC is not covered in this tutorial.

one application framework.
