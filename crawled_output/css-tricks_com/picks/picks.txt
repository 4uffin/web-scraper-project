infrequently.org
Photo by Photo by Artan Sadiku Commentary about browsers and the features they support is sometimes pejorative towards pre-standardisation features.

ma.tt

Really Simple Licensing
ma.tt
It’s been a busy (and tragic) week but one of the more interesting things to launch was the Really Simple Licensing standard. I have a lot of scars from the web standards wars, so I’m hesitant to dive back in, but this is from a lot of the early Web…

Styling siblings with CSS has never been easier. Experimenting with sibling-count and sibling-index
utilitybend.com
I’ve been living a lot in “select land” with my last articles, and even tho I’m still passionate about all things Open UI, I really wanted to get back to some of those newer yummy CSS features. I was building a bunch of demos already, but never had the chance…
