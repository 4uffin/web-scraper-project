Compiling Multiple CSS Files into One
Always Twisted
|
https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/UnSassing-my-CSS-CSS-imports
Read commentary
Stu Robson is on a mission to “un-Sass” his CSS. I see articles like this pop up every year, and for good reason as CSS has grown so many new legs in recent years. So much so that much of the core features that may have prompted you to reach for Sass in the past are now baked directly into CSS. In fact, we have Jeff Bridgforth on tap with a related article next week.
What I like about Stu’s stab at this is that it’s an ongoing journey rather than a wholesale switch. In fact, he’s out with a new post that pokes specifically at compiling multiple CSS files into a single file. Splitting and organizing styles into separate files is definitely the reason I continue to Sass-ify my work. I love being able to find exactly what I need in a specific file and updating it without having to dig through a monolith of style rules.

A Few Things About the Anchor Element’s href You Might Not Have Known
Jim Nielsen's Blog

Read commentary
I love “re-learning” things I thought I knew. HTML is full of those opportunities (case in point, like today) since it’s where you typically start learning about web development. And in those early days, you don’t know what you don’t know.
So, thanks Jim Nielsen for giving me a reason to give URL patterns another look. It’s easy to take URL superpowers for granted, even if you already have these patterns under your belt.

Sunkanmi Fafowora is a frequent flier around here. You’ve probably seen his name pop up in the CSS-Tricks Almanac and we actually just published something today that he wrote up for the color-mix() function. The guy spends a lot of time in the Almanac because he loves technical documentation, something he showed off when writing the CSS Color Functions Guide.
And it’s that love for technical documentation that lead him to ship CSS-Questions (gotta love that hyphenated URL, right?!), a place where you can test your CSS knowledge with over 100 questions. You can take the comprehensive exam or a basic one with 20 questions if all you want is a pop quiz.

We don’t publish a big ol’ bunch of links pushing products and whatnot around here. But I do like sharing a good resource when it’s available and that’s what I’m doing here with Andy Clarke’s upcoming Practical Layout Workshop.

Brad Frost introduced the “Atomic Design” concept wayyyy back in 2013. He even wrote a book on it. And we all took notice, because that term has been part of our lexicon ever since.

The Layout Maestro Course
The Layout Maestro
|
https://layoutmaestro.ishadeed.com
Read commentary
Layout. It’s one of those easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master things, like they say about playing bass. Not because it’s innately difficult to, say, place two elements next to each other, but because there are many, many ways to tackle it. And layout is one area of CSS that seems to evolve more than others, as we’ve seen in the past 10-ish years with the Flexbox, CSS Grid, Subgrid, and now Masonry to name but a few. May as well toss in Container Queries while we’re at it. And reading flow. And…
That’s a good way to start talking about a new online course that Ahmad Shadeed is planning to release called The Layout Maestro. I love that name, by the way. It captures exactly how I think about working with layouts: orchestrating how and where things are arranged on a page. Layouts are rarely static these days. They are expected to adapt to the user’s context, not totally unlike a song changing keys.

KelpUI is new library that Chris Ferdinandi is developing, designed to leverage newer CSS features and Web Components. I’ve enjoyed following Chris as he’s published an ongoing series of articles detailing his thought process behind the library, getting deep into his approach. You really get a clear picture of his strategy and I love it.

The State of CSS 2025 Survey is out!

The State of CSS 2025 Survey dropped a few days ago, and besides waiting for the results, it’s exciting to see a lot of the new things shipped to CSS over the past year reflected in the questions. To be specific, the next survey covers the following features:

SVG to CSS Shape Converter
CSS Generators
|
https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/
Read commentary
Shape master Temani Afif has what might be the largest collection of CSS shapes on the planet with all the tools to generate them on the fly. There’s a mix of clever techniques he’s typically used to make those shapes, many of which he’s covered here at CSS-Tricks over the years.
Some of the more complex shapes were commonly clipped with the path() function. That makes a lot of sense because it literally accepts SVG path coordinates that you can draw in an app like Figma and export.
But Temani has gone all-in on the newly-released shape() function which recently rolled out in both Chromium browsers and Safari. That includes a brand-new generator that converts path() shapes in shape() commands instead.

HTML Email Accessibility Report 2025
Email Markup Consortium

https://emailmarkup.org/en/reports/accessibility/2025/
Read commentary
Some weekend reading on the heels of Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAADM), which took place yesterday. The Email Markup Consortium (EMC) released its 2025 study on the accessibility in HTML emails, and the TL;DR is not totally dissimilar from what we heard from WebAIM’s annual web report:
This is the third full year for this report and we are disappointed to see the same issues as we have in previous years. The top 10 issues haven’t changed order since last year, apart from the addition of color contrast, which can be put down to a change in the testing and reporting.

A working draft for CSS Environment Variables is posted. Same concept as var(), but env() is a “global” variable at the document level for values the user agent is privy to.
