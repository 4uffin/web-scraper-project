Hex Bots Wall Crawler Gecko CNET's Bridget Carey says this won her over "both as a mom and as someone who delights in making my co-workers squirm." By using a remote -- that can be as far as 25 feet away -- you can make it scale walls or perform spin tricks, she explains. To charge it, there's a USB-C port and you'll need two AAA batteries for the remote.Read our review here.

RealFX Disney Stitch Not just any puppet -- this amazing 18-inch-tall Stitch toy offers 100 different action and sound combinations. You can use the buttons inside to move his ears and mouth and make his eyes blink, and the sound effects will automatically change based on how you're using him. He'll react with different moods depending on whether you make his ears go up and down, and if you pet his head, he'll react happily. "He might be the best toy to land on Earth this year," declared CNET's Bridget Carey.

3Doodler Start Plus This cool 3D printing pen lets kids create anything they could possibly imagine out of plastic filaments. It's slim and light, making it easy for small hands to hold, and it's great introduction to the world of 3D printing. The pen melts sticks of plastic so kids can draw them into any shape, and the nozzle and melted plastic aren't hot, so it won't burn little hands. CNET's Bridget Carey confirms, "I've tested it; you can put the tip to your skin and draw on your finger. I had no worries giving it to my kids."

Furby interactive plush toy Furby is back and better than ever. It comes with five voice modes, a bunch of dance moves and more than 600 unique responses, including phrases, jokes, songs and more. Plus, it can glow in the dark. It can communicate with other Furbies too and is quite huggable. Past concerns about the Furby can be kicked to the curb -- there's no Wi-Fi connectivity, no app and no LCD screen eyes. Basically, it's more doll than robot, which is a huge plus.

Dog-E If your little one has been begging for a dog and you're apprehensive about all the responsibility, Dog-E may be the pet for you. Although WowWee's Dog-E isn't the first robot dog to hit the toy market, this pup has a bunch of unique features that make it stand out from the pack (no pun intended). Each Dog-E is unique in their colored light designs and personality traits -- you won't know which version you've got until it's out of the box. There are over 200 sounds and reactions to expect with your new robot pup, including real dog sounds, tail wagging and a cute little run. An accompanying mobile app adds further interactive play, allowing you to teach it tricks and track its basic needs. Read our WowWee Dog-E Robot Dog review.

WowWee Fingerlings Interactive Baby Monkey Fingerlings are back, and these finger monkeys are more than meets the eye. Equipped with more sensors, these fuzzy cuties know when they're on your finger and have more animated features than ever before. Each monkey in the set comes in a different color and personality, which means they're programmed with a variety of different reactions. Might as well collect them all.

Thames & Kosmos Gecko Run: Marble Run Starter Set This isn't just any old marble set. This version is more like a gecko, with suction cups that let the chutes and funnels climb up and down your walls. "Kids drop in the included marbles and watch gravity take its course as they roll down and drop from piece-to-piece," explains CNET's Bree Fowler. "Of course, it doesn't work perfectly each time and marbles go flying, but that's half the fun and how kids learn; they can adjust the pieces and try again." Expansion sets are available too and include fun add-ons, like loops and trampolines.

Twenty interactive animals -- like a cat, unicorn and dragon -- can be unlocked the more your kiddo plays with Bitzee.

Loog Mini Electric Guitar If your child has expressed an interest in playing an instrument, this is a great starter instrument and teaches kids how to play songs via flashcards and video lessons. It's a three-string guitar, has a built-in amp and speaker and comes in six fun colors, from light blue to red to pink.

Lexibook Harry Potter Electronic Chess Set Chess took off among kids a couple of years ago, and it's still going strong. This chess set makes a great gift for Potterheads who are also chess fans -- or aspiring chess fans. The keyboard has light and sound effects and players can choose from 64 levels of difficulty. There's also a training mode, which lets a player know if the move they just made is a good one and lets them try again.

Moonlite Storytime Mini Projector with Eric Carle Stories Bedtime stories get a huge boost with this Moonlite Storytime mini projector. It attaches to the flashlight on your cell phone so that you can project each "page" of a story onto the while while it plays sound effects as you read along to your child. The projector is easy to use and gets kids excited about reading and bedtime -- win, win. This set includes four Eric Carle classics: The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Very Busy Spider, Brown Bear Brown Bear  and Mister Seahorse.

Power Saber While lightsabers are (still) a thing of fantasy, a new toy comes close to replicating the real thing without costing a fortune. The $50 Power Saber not only lights up, but it extends on its own, giving the effect of firing up a real lightsaber to battle against a Sith Lord. The sound effects make the experience all the more immersive. You can choose from red or green, depending on what side of the Force your giftee is drawn to. It's become a go-to gift for CNET's Russel Holly.

Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza Card Game If your kids like high-energy card games like Uno, they'll love this. Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is highly addictive and great for game nights. Up to eight people can play at once and everyone takes turns flipping over a card, saying a word -- Taco, Goat and so on -- while flipping. If the spoken word matches whatever card is being flipped, everyone tries to slap their hand down. The last person to do so has to take the stack. Trust us, it's fun. CNET contributor Oliver Haslam says, "It might be the most fun I've had with a card game since forever, and it made our recent vacation very memorable."

It's so well-polished."

Nintendo Switch OLED It's not the Switch 2, but stock on Nintendo's latest console has been limited. So until you can get your hands on one, we recommend the OLED. You can give your kiddo hours of entertainment playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart, Zelda, Just Dance or whatever games they're into. The Switch is definitely a better console for younger kids than the more expensive Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. We also love that the Switch can be played on a TV or hand-held.

GoCube - Smart Cube 3D Puzzle If you've always wanted to know how to complete a Rubik's cube, but could never get the hang of it, now's your chance, CNET's James Bricknell says. The GoCube connects to your phone or tablet and takes you through the steps of solving a cube using "algorithms," so to speak. "It's the first time I've felt I had a handle on manipulating a puzzle cube without it being completely random," he says. "Learning a new skill as a dad, especially one that can impress your kids, is always worthwhile -- and the app even lets you play battle games with your kids to make it more family-oriented."

Nex Playground Nex Playground looks like a cube with a camera, but it's so much more than that. The innovative, interactive video game console doesn't use controllers. Instead, it connects to your TV and uses a built-in wide-angle camera to track movements to play games like Fruit Ninja, Whac-a-Mole, and more. The console comes with five games, but you can purchase a separate 3-month ($49) or 12-month ($89) Play Pass that unlocks the full catalog of games (new ones are added each month). Adding a subscription to the purchase price sounds like a bummer, but when you consider the lofty price tag that comes with individual video games for other consoles, it's not so bad. Plus, the Play Pass comes with games like How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, and Gabby's Dollhouse, which will likely be fan favorites for kids. Don't be surprised if you find yourself playing when the kids aren't around too.

Foamnasium Blocksy + Play Couch There are building blocks and then there are building cushions. Turns out it's a ton of fun to build forts, book nooks and obstacle courses with big, cushy pieces of foam. CNET contributor Deena Shinn says, "I tell all of my friends with young kids to invest in a play couch. It's the most consistently used toy in our house and is an absolute saving grace in the winter, when my kids need to get their energy out but it's gross outside. You'd be surprised how tiring it can be to jump on a foam stage for an hour."

Caves, tunnels, rockets and houses -- the sky's the limit for what can be constructed.

But whenever you try to clean up, they suddenly want nothing to do with toys and instead try to take the vacuum or mop from you. Well, this LeapFrog Pick Up and Count Vacuum taps into that common scenario, but in a kid-friendly, educational manner. Instead of going for your Dyson, they can use their vacuum and clean up 10 play "dust" pieces -- and learn numbers and colors in the process. Plus, it has a dial they can turn, which is so satisfying to little ones.

Sesame Street Elmo Slide! Sesame Street's Elmo never goes out of style. This 14-inch tall interactive doll encourages movement and singing and will get your little one up and dancing. Like the Just Play Elmo Plush, your kiddo can press Elmo's right hand to play a game of "Elmo Says" -- a fun, preschool-friendly riff on "Simon Says." He can also speak in Spanish, as well as in English, which is another bonus.

KiwiCo Bake-a-Cake Stand Mixer A great gift for pretend play that will keep little hands busy for hours. "My two-year-old loves 'helping' me in the kitchen, and she likes it even better when I help her bake goodies with her own KiwiCo stand mixer and accessories," says CNET contributor Deena Shinn. "We pretend to crack eggs and pour in the sugar to whip up birthday cakes, much to her delight."

What are the top retailers to shop for toy gifts?The top retailers to shop for toy gifts include Target, Walmart, and Amazon. These stores have large varieties of toys for every age group, and stock toys from top brands such as Hasbro and Lego. GameStop is a good option for toys, figurines and games for older kids. It's also worth checking out individual toy brand websites, including Lego, Disney, Nintendo and even Mattel, since they often have exclusive items.Do toy prices go down after Christmas? Generally, the cheapest prices we see all year for the hottest toys and games are during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. You might, however, see markdowns after Christmas on toys that didn't sell as well. Stores such as Target and Walmart are likely to mark down toys after Christmas, but it's usually the leftovers. Some retailers might offer New Year's discounts, and there are Presidents Day sales in February.What are great toys for both girls and boys?First, let's be clear that any type of toy is good for any kid, regardless of gender. Age and interests are much better starting points when hunting for a gift, because that dictates how complicated the toy can be and helps narrow down the category. That said, there are toys that have had universal appeal among all genders for many decades. Here are just a few:Building toys: Lego, Magna-tiles and K'nexPuzzlesBoard gamesSports toys: Roller skates, skateboard, soccer ball, basketball, etcCreative and sensory toys: Play-Doh, Kinetic Sand, fidget toysPlay-pretend toys: toy tools, kitchen sets, toy food, vehiclesPlushiesMore cool toys for kids41 Best Gifts for Teens in 2025Best Star Wars Gifts: Top Picks From Across the GalaxyBest Gifts for Tweens in 2025Best Gifts for 2-Year-Olds
