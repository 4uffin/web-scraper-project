Martin Lawrence and Will Smith star in Bad Boys. Columbia Pictures/Getty Images
Peacock's movie library is solid. I say that as someone who regularly forgets to check out the NBC Universal-owned streaming service when I'm in the mood for a movie night. We get so used to tapping into the big dogs like Netflix and Disney Plus, and they are chock full of good stuff, but Peacock deserves its flowers, too. There's always something cool to watch on Peacock, no matter what genre you're looking for.Then there's the Universal part of the equation. Universal Pictures knows its way around producing blockbusters and Oscar-winning movies. What's cool about that is that Peacock has a delightful selection of these releases for your viewing pleasure. See at PeacockI guarantee you'll find something below that fits your interests. Scroll on to find more worthwhile movies you should dig into. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Read more: Peacock Review: Few Originals, but Cheap Access to Network TV, Movies May Grab You
Miramax
Reservoir Dogs
Quentin Tarantino's first movie, Reservoir Dogs, introduced the director to the world and ushered in a new era of edgy, independent cinema. The cast is superb, the story is simple and tragic and the soundtrack is legendary. What else is there to say?

Sicario
Sicario, which stars Benicio del Toro, Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin, takes viewers deep into an escalating drug war at the US-Mexico border. The drama is tense, and the action is grueling, which makes sense considering that Taylor Sheridan wrote the script and Dune visionary Denis Villeneuve directed the movie.
Lionsgate
3:10 to Yuma
The movie 3:10 to Yuma is an epic modern-day western. It's a remake of the 1957 western of the same name (and both are inspired by a short story by Elmore Leonard). James Mangold directed the 2007 version in which Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, a rancher who takes on a job to guide outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to a train that'll transport him to prison. As you may expect, it's not an easy task. Ben Foster. who's excellent as the villainous Charlie Prince, also stars alongside Peter Fonda, Gretchen Mol and Alan Tudyk.
Sony Pictures Entertainment
21 Jump Street
The 2012 action comedy takes inspiration from the Johnny Depp-led TV show of the 1980s and throws two rookie cops into undercover gigs at the local high school. The chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill is ultimately what makes this movie work. It spawned a sequel two years later, and it's too bad we never got a third movie.
20th Century Fox/Largo Entertainment
Point Break
In Point Break, a gang of renegade surfers don the masks of ex-presidents and rob banks. And they're pretty good at it, too. Enter FBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), a young and brash law enforcement officer who goes undercover and infiltrates the group and cozies up to its leader, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze), to take them down. Kathryn Bigelow directed this over-the-top action movie, which was a memorable role for Swayze and a star-making turn for Reeves.
Columbia Pictures/Getty Images
Bad Boys
Michael Bay's 1995 buddy cop movie spawned a franchise that has endured for three decades. It also leveled up Martin Lawrence's career and cemented Will Smith as a bona fide action star. I've never been able to watch him run down the street with his shirt open the same way again.
Universal Pictures
The Breakfast Club
John Hughes wrote and directed 1985's The Breakfast Club, which takes place over one Saturday in detention. The gist of the movie? Throw a group of high-school stereotypes -- the rebel, the goth girl, the jock, the nerd and the princess -- together and see how they get along. Unsurprisingly, they have more in common than they thought.
Video screenshot by Gael Fashingbauer Cooper/CNET
Coming to America
In Coming to America, Eddie Murphy stars as Prince Akeem -- a man who decides to hide his royal status in order to find true love. He comes to America along with Semmi (Arsenio Hall), his right-hand man who hates hiding his lavish lifestyle. Some of the biggest highlights come from the duo's portrayal of hilarious side characters, from Saul, the Jewish barbershop owner, to the boisterous Reverend Brown.
DreamWorks
Shrek
Shrek was the first movie to win the Academy Award for best animated feature. It's sort of crazy to think that animated movies weren't recognized by the Oscars until 2001, but Shrek deserved the win. The voice performances of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy are on point and deliver delightful comedy and memorable pop culture moments. The movie helped usher in a new era of CGI effects and put DreamWorks on the map. More than two decades later, it's still a thoroughly enjoyable watch.
Warner Bros. Pictures
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
Look, I am not here to argue about the best Harry Potter movie in the franchise. The series is jam-packed with great stuff. However, the third installment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, really showed the world how great a Harry Potter story could be. Not to mention, it introduced Gary Oldman's rebellious wizard Sirius Black. And you really can't go wrong with putting Oldman in anything.
