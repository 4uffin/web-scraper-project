Our top gifts for tweens

Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState 40-ounce Tumbler The Stanley cup has been hitting social media feeds for a while, so we decided to try it out ourselves. Though it's not spill-proof, it definitely keeps you hydrated all day, which is perfect for tweens on the go.

Cameras
Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 Instant Camera Selfies are important. And what better way to take selfies and fun pictures with friends than with an Instax? It's easy for your tween to throw into a large pocket or backpack so they can document daily life. There's also something great about immediately getting a physical photo after snapping a pic.

LED strip lights Create a fun, chill space for your tween with these affordable LED strip lights. Set them on one solid color, or rotate through different hues on rainbow mode. You can also sync them to music. I purchased one and ended up buying a second strip for my son's room since he loves them that much. They come with an app, but my kid prefers to use them with Alexa for voice control.

AirPods 4 AirPods are a tween staple. The AirPods 4 are the latest in Apple's lineup, and thanks to improved sound and the powerful H2 chip, they're a worthy upgrade, according to CNET's David Carnoy. In a first, Apple is offering two models, the cheaper, entry-level version for $129, and the step-up earbuds with noise cancellation for $179.
$129 at Apple

Best gifts for tweens who love arts and crafts
Fashion
Friendship bracelet kit If your tween is a Swiftie, chances are they'll want to have plenty of friendship bracelets on hand. Yes, trading friendship bracelets at Taylor Swift shows is a thing. This kit comes with 6,000 clay beads in 24 colors, along with letters and charms for customization.
$9 at Amazon

Toys & Tabletop Games
Locca boba tea kit If your tween is into boba tea, also known as bubble tea, this kit has everything they'll need to make their own delicious concoctions at home. It includes tapioca balls, a variety of loose-leaf teas, straws and recipe cards.

Photo-clip string lights Once your tween starts snapping pics with their Instax, they'll need a great backdrop and lighting. These dreamy string lights help add a magical feel to any room. With 50 clips for their favorite pics, your tween will love their sparkling retreat.
$12 at Amazon
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
DIY mochi ice cream kit What tween doesn't love mochi? Making homemade mochi can be tricky, but this kit makes it super easy, and it'll be a fun rainy day project for your preteen. Flavors include matcha green tea and cocoa powder, but you can come up with your own flavors, too.
$41 at Amazon
Close
Best gifts for tweens who love sports and outdoors
Video Cameras
GoPro Hero 10 If your tween wants to document their next action adventure, GoPro cameras can't be beat. We love the newer GoPro Hero 13, but not its $400 price. The GoPro Hero 10 is not nearly as much, and they'll get a lot for the money, including amazing stabilization and 5.3K video.
$249 at Amazon
Close
Misc
Spikeball Spikeball is a trendy, fast-paced game that combines elements of volleyball and four square. Instead of hitting a large ball over a straight net, your tween will be smacking a
softer, grapefruit-size ball onto a bouncy, ringed net, sort of like tetherball but without the string. Be prepared, parents: This is a physical game that requires
fast movement and probably some diving to score points.
Consequently, this might be best for just the kids, though it does require four players.
$64 at Amazon

Toys & Tabletop Games
Skyfire Target Drone This clever drone can be used with any Nerf gun or gel blaster for target practice. Just throw it up, and the drone levitates and maneuvers as it tries to avoid blasts and tracks your hits. It's tons of fun to play solo or with a group of friends.
$19 at Amazon
$19 at Target
Close
Misc
Gel Blaster Surge Gel Blaster's Surge is tons of fun for kids and adults. Note that you definitely want to take this one outside, and the "Gellets" do sting a little on impact — not as bad as paintball or airsoft — but protective eyewear is still recommended. The gel pellets are water based and evaporate after shooting. That means no more cleaning up a hundred foam Nerf darts.
$21 at Target
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
Pro-Spin Portable Ping-Pong Ping-pong is a great rainy day activity, but not everyone has the space — or the pocketbook — for a full ping-pong table. Enter Pro-Spin's portable ping-pong set. It comes with two paddles, three balls, and a retractable net that clamps onto any table. We were impressed by the overall quality of the equipment, though it works best if you've got a standard rectangular dining or patio table.
$45 at Amazon

Razor E100 Electric Scooter An electric scooter is a great way to get tweens off their screens and outside. Luckily, not all motorized scooters are the bulky behemoths you see commuters zipping around on. Razor's E100 is for kids ages 8 and up, and the max speed is 10 mph. Tweens will especially appreciate the
blue LEDs on the deck that light up whenever they twist the throttle.

Laegendary RC Car (Update: Currently Unavailable) They might have outgrown Hot Wheels, but no one is too old for this 1:12 RC monster truck from Laegendary. CNET's James Bricknell is the proud owner of a lot of RC cars, and Laegendary makes his favorite model. Keep in mind that it's a step up from the remote-controlled cars they might have used when they were little, with speeds that go up to 30 mph, so it'll probably take some practice to learn how to maneuver it.
$56 at Amazon
Close
Fashion
Deerc D10 Drone They don't have to be a seasoned pilot to fly Deerc's budget-friendly D10. It's easy to operate and has a built-in camera that captures and records high-definition video. It's compact, foldable and weighs just 5.8 ounces, so tweens can take it just about anywhere.
$80 at Walmart

Best gifts for tweens who love beauty and skincare
Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Now is the time of year when tweens especially need protection for dry or chapped lips. Laneige is a popular brand that's known for its intense hydration and soothing antioxidant ingredients. Wear it while you sleep to soften dry lips, or slip it into your backpack to prevent dehydration throughout the day. It comes in a variety of delectable flavors, but Eggnog and Candy Cane are the favorites of the season.
$24 at Sephora
Close
Misc
Youth To The People Superfood Gentle Antioxidant Cleanser As any tween will tell you, this is the age where skincare becomes front and center. Youth To The People's Superfood cleanser is known for tackling oily complexions while being gentle on your skin, and it's a top choice among tweens.
$39 at Sephora
$39 at Amazon
Close
Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Jet Set Sol de Janeiro's popular scents are deliciously sweet, with notes of warm vanilla and caramel, and plenty of beach vibes that are perfect for tweens. This set includes the popular Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, a moisturizing shower gel and a light perfume mist.
$32 at Sephora

Toys & Tabletop Games
TonyMoly Superfood Mask Bowl Set Give the gift of luminous skin with this six-piece mask set. Tweens will find every mask they need for a healthy complexion, including a green tea sheet mask to brighten and purify, an aloe mask for intense hydration, and a coconut sheet mask to clean and revitalize.

Best gifts for tweens who love games
Consoles
Nintendo Switch OLED If your kid doesn't have a Nintendo Switch, you can't go wrong with this gaming system. It's a splurge, but it's not as expensive as the PS5 or Xbox Series X, and it's easier to travel with. The Switch offers endless entertainment, with games including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Pimkin 4 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It's fun for adults, too.

D&D Starter Kit: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle If your tween has been wanting to learn about Dungeons & Dragons, this is the perfect way to start. CNET's James Bricknell is an avid tabletop gamer and loves giving these starter kits out to friends and family. "This box has everything you need to start your first adventure," he says. "Imagination is the key to a good D&D campaign, but you also need rules and dice. This set gives you both."
$20 at Amazon
Close
Gaming Accessories
SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL gaming keyboard If the tween in your life is into PC gaming, level up their toolbox with a gaming keyboard. The SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL is our favorite budget gaming keyboard, thanks to its durability, quiet switches and eight lighting zones. Bonus: It's IP32 water-resistant, so it won't matter if your tween is a chronic spiller.
$35 at Amazon
Close
Comics & Toys
Throw, Throw Burrito If your tween is a fan of Exploding Kittens (or even if not), they'll get a kick out of this game. It's a card game and dodgeball set (but with burritos!) all in one. Players collect matching cards to score points, all while dodging flying burritos thrown by opponents. It's a great way to get tweens off their screens. Just be sure to move any breakables out of the line of fire.

What are the best stores to shop for a gift for a tween?Amazon, Target and Walmart offer a wide variety of games and toys for tweens, as well as tech gadgets like headphones, action cameras and portable gaming devices. If you're looking for more creative tween gifts, Michaels has a large selection of arts and craft supplies, and Williams Sonoma is a good place to shop for DIY food kits, including make-your-own mochi and rainbow pop-up cakes. Sephora is a good option for beauty supplies and skincare. And if you're looking for top fashion trends, it's worth checking out Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie and Fitch, H&M and Lululemon. Keep in mind that a lot of tweens also enjoy thrifting. If that's the case with your tween, you might want to consider giving them a gift card to an online second-hand clothing store like ThredUp. What is the most unique gift idea for a tween?Finding a unique gift for a tween can be challenging. You'll want to do a little sleuthing to figure out their interests and hobbies and then combine that with something unexpected. If they enjoy cooking, get them a DIY food kit to let them explore their creativity in the kitchen. If they enjoy gaming, cool strip lights or a new light-up keyboard can enhance their game setup. Personalization can also make a gift stand out, whether it's custom-made shoes or something monogrammed.
