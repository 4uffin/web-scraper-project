Best tech gifts for tweens
Apple Watch SE 3 If you've been holding out on getting your tween a phone, a smartwatch is a good alternative. It's a great way for them to stay connected without all the distractions of a smartphone. At a starting price of $249, the new Apple Watch SE 3 costs considerably less than the Series 11, but offers many of the same features, including the powerful S10 chip, sleep scores and wrist temperature sensing.
$249 at Apple

Smart Home
LED strip lights Create a fun, chill space for your tween with these affordable LED strip lights. Set them on a solid color or rotate through different hues on rainbow mode. You can also sync them to music. I purchased one and ended up buying a second strip for my son's room since he loves them that much. They come with an app, but my kid prefers to use them with Alexa for voice control.
$25 at Amazon
Close
AirPods 4 AirPods are a tween staple. The AirPods 4 feature a slightly smaller design and better sound than their predecessor, according to CNET's David Carnoy. Apple offers two models of the AirPods 4, the cheaper, entry-level version for $129, and the step-up earbuds with noise cancellation for $179.
$129 at Apple
Close
Speakers
JBL Go 4 Available in multiple colors, JBL's smallest Bluetooth speaker is durable, dust-proof and has an IP67 water-resistance rating, which means it can survive being submerged in water. Despite its small size (it actually fits in a large pocket), it sounds better than you might think. All in all, it's one of the top micro Bluetooth speakers out there.

Best gaming gifts for tweens
Nintendo
Nintendo Switch 2 The Switch 2 is a splurge, but it's not as expensive as the PS5 or Xbox Series X, and it's easier to travel with. It offers endless entertainment, with games including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Donkey Kong Bananza and Mario Kart World. It's fun for adults, too. Read our review of the Nintendo Switch 2.
$499 at Amazon
Close
Keyboards
SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL gaming keyboard If the tween in your life is into PC gaming, level up their toolbox with a gaming keyboard. The SteelSeries Apex 3 TKL is our favorite budget gaming keyboard, thanks to its durability, quiet switches and eight lighting zones. Bonus: It's IP32 water-resistant, so it won't matter if your tween is a chronic spiller.
$35 at Amazon
Close
Bluetooth Headsets
HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless Gaming Headset Any gamer will tell you that three things are key in a headset: comfort, battery life and sound quality. HyperX's Cloud Alpha Wireless headset wins in all three categories, according to CNET gaming hardware expert Lori Grunin. You can find more of her gaming headset recommendations here.
$143 at Amazon

Video Games
Meta Quest 3 VR is becoming popular among kids, and the Meta Quest 3 is our top pick for the best VR headset of 2025. Kids can do more than just play Gorilla Tag. They can also play table tennis, golf, take piano lessons and even "attend" their favorite band's concerts, all from the comfort of their home. Note that preteens need to obtain their parent's permission and be at least 10 years old to sign up for a Meta Quest account. As a parent, it's especially important to monitor the account and create screen time limits.

Best gifts for creative tweens

Friendship bracelet kit If your tween is a Swiftie, chances are they'll want to have plenty of friendship bracelets on hand. Yes, trading friendship bracelets with fellow Taylor Swift fans is a thing. This kit comes with 6,000 clay beads in 24 colors, along with letters and charms for customization.
$9 at Amazon
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
Locca boba tea kit If your tween is into boba tea, also known as bubble tea, this kit has everything they'll need to make their own delicious concoctions at home. It includes tapioca balls, a variety of loose-leaf teas, straws and recipe cards.
$40 at Amazon
$40 at Walmart
Close
Cameras
Fujifilm Instax Mini 12 Instant Camera Selfies are important. And what better way to take selfies and fun pictures with friends than with an Instax? It's easy for your tween to throw into a large pocket or backpack so they can document daily life. There's also something great about immediately getting a physical photo after snapping a pic.
$89 at Walmart
$94 at Best Buy
$88 at Amazon
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
Photo-clip string lights Once your tween starts snapping pics with their Instax, they'll need a great backdrop and lighting. These dreamy string lights help add a magical feel to any room. With 50 clips for their favorite pics, your tween will love their sparkling retreat.
$12 at Amazon

Best gifts for active tweens
Home
GoPro Hero 12 If your tween wants to document their next action adventure, GoPro action cameras can't be beat. We love the newer GoPro Hero 13, but not its $430 price. The GoPro Hero 12 costs considerably less and offers many of the same features, including excellent image quality and video resolution.
$300 at Amazon
Close
Haiboxing RC Car They might have outgrown Hot Wheels, but no one is too old for this 1:12 RC monster truck from Haiboxing. Keep in mind that it's not like the remote-controlled cars they might have had when they were little. With speeds that surpass 20 mph, it takes some practice to learn how to maneuver it.
$105 at Amazon
Close
Fashion
Deerc D10 Drone They don't have to be a seasoned pilot to fly Deerc's budget-friendly D10. It's easy to operate and has a built-in camera that captures and records high-definition video. It's compact, foldable and weighs just 5.8 ounces, so tweens can take this drone just about anywhere.
$80 at Walmart
Close
Misc
Gel Blaster Surge Gel Blaster's Surge is tons of fun for kids and adults. Note that you definitely want to take this one outside, and the "Gellets" do sting a little on impact — not as bad as paintball or airsoft — but protective eyewear is still recommended. The gel pellets are water based and evaporate after shooting. That means no more cleaning up a hundred foam darts.
$20 at Target
Close
Home
Razor E100 Electric Scooter An electric scooter is a great way to get tweens off their screens and outside. Luckily, not all motorized scooters are the bulky behemoths you see commuters zipping around on. Razor's E100 is for kids ages 8 and up, and the max speed is 10 mph. Tweens will especially appreciate the blue LEDs on the deck that light up when they twist the throttle.
$198 at Walmart
$226 at Amazon
Close
Misc
Spikeball Spikeball is a trendy, fast-paced game that combines elements of volleyball and four square. Instead of hitting a large ball over a straight net, your tween will be smacking a
softer, grapefruit-size ball onto a bouncy, ringed net, sort of like tetherball but without the string. Be prepared, parents: This is a physical game that requires
fast movement and probably some diving to score points. Consequently, this might be best for just the kids, though it does require four players.
$64 at Amazon
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
Skyfire Target Drone This clever drone can be used with any Nerf gun or gel blaster for target practice. Just throw it up, and the drone levitates and maneuvers as it tries to avoid blasts and tracks your hits. It's fun to play solo or with a group of friends.
$19 at Amazon
$19 at Target
Close
Toys & Tabletop Games
Pro-Spin Portable Ping-Pong Ping-pong is a great rainy day activity, but not everyone has the space — or the pocketbook — for a full ping-pong table. Enter Pro-Spin's portable ping-pong set. It comes with two paddles, three balls and a retractable net that clamps onto any table. We were impressed by the overall quality of the equipment, though it works best if you've got a standard rectangular dining or patio table.
$40 at Amazon
$40 at Walmart

Best TikTok-viral skincare gifts for tweens
Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Laneige's Lip Sleeping Mask became popular on TikTok and is still a favorite among tweens, thanks to its intense hydration and soothing antioxidant ingredients. Wear it while you sleep to soften dry lips, or slip it into your backpack to prevent dehydration throughout the day.
$25 at Sephora
Close
Misc
Youth to the People Superfood Gentle Antioxidant Cleanser As any tween will tell you, this is the age where skin care becomes front and center. Youth to the People's Superfood cleanser is known for tackling oily complexions while being gentle on your skin, and it's a top choice among tweens.
$39 at Sephora
$39 at Amazon
Close
Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Jet Set Sol de Janeiro's popular scents are deliciously sweet, with notes of warm vanilla and caramel, and plenty of beach vibes that are perfect for tweens. This set includes the popular Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, a moisturizing shower gel and a light perfume mist.
$34 at Sephora
Close
TonyMoly Superfood Mask Bowl Set Give the gift of luminous skin with this six-piece mask set. Tweens will find every mask they need for a healthy complexion, including a green tea sheet mask to brighten and purify, an aloe mask for intense hydration and a coconut sheet mask to clean and revitalize.

What are the best stores to shop for a gift for a tween?Amazon, Target and Walmart offer a wide variety of games and toys for tweens, as well as tech gadgets like headphones, action cameras and portable gaming devices. If you're looking for more creative tween gifts, Michaels has a large selection of arts and craft supplies, and Williams Sonoma is a good place to shop for DIY food kits, including make-your-own mochi and rainbow pop-up cakes. Sephora is a good option for beauty supplies and skin care. And if you're looking for top fashion trends, it's worth checking out Urban Outfitters, Abercrombie and Fitch, H&M and Lululemon. Keep in mind that a lot of tweens also enjoy thrifting. If that's the case with your tween, you might want to consider giving them a gift card to an online secondhand clothing store like ThredUp. What is the most unique gift idea for a tween?Finding a unique gift for a tween can be challenging. You'll want to do a little sleuthing to figure out their interests and hobbies and then combine that with something unexpected. If they enjoy cooking, get them a DIY food kit to let them explore their creativity in the kitchen. If they enjoy gaming, cool strip lights or a new light-up keyboard can enhance their game setup. Personalization can also make a gift stand out, whether it's custom-made shoes or something that's monogrammed.
