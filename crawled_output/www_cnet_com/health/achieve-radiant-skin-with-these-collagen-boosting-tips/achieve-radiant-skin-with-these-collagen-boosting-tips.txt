Boosting collagen can help your skin, joints, and even your gut health.
Gettys Images/Ivan Bajic
As we age, our skin loses elasticity and its radiant look can fade. Collagen is directly related to the health of our skin, and boosting the amount in your system can ensure you look amazing whether you're 25 or 75. Collagen is essential for skin elasticity, joint health, and overall structural support. While social media is full of collagen powders and serums, the real magic lies in what you eat. By understanding how your body produces and breaks down collagen -- and by making smart, nutrient-dense food choices -- you can support healthy collagen levels without relying solely on products. Here's how to naturally enhance your collagen production through diet and daily habits.Read more: Want Collagen's Anti-Aging Properties?

What is collagen and what does it do?Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and is important in maintaining your body's functions. Registered dietitian and nutritionist Tony Castillo explains that the best way to think about collagen is "as a glue to hold things together." It's the major building block of tendons, ligaments, bones, muscles and skin. It also helps your body rebuild itself after injuries, especially at sites like tendons, ligaments and muscles. Take a moment to thank collagen for literally keeping your body together.Your body creates its own collagen by combining amino acids. The process also uses vitamin C, zinc and copper, so you can promote natural collagen production by eating a well-balanced diet (more on that later).Read more: 10 Daily Habits to Improve Your Eye Health
Collagen is the key to smoothing out wrinkled skin when consumed in moderation.  Peter Finch/Getty ImagesDo I have enough collagen?As we get older, our bodies start to naturally produce less collagen. Wrinkles and aches are a part of the aging process, but you may be wondering if low collagen is to blame for your ailments. Castillo says that the following are signs that you may be low on the vital protein:Less flexible tendons and ligamentsWrinkles on skinWeak musclesWorn-out cartilage or joint painGastrointestinal issues caused by thinning of the lining of the digestive tractIf any physical symptoms significantly interfere with your quality of life, check in with your doctor. If you'd just like smoother skin and a little more pep in your step, it could be worth looking into how you can increase your collagen levels.Do I really need collagen supplements and skin treatments?
Anna Efetova/Getty ImagesAlthough you can certainly try to produce more collagen naturally (more on that later), at this point you're probably wondering if those trendy collagen supplements and skin treatments actually work. I have an unsatisfying answer to the burning question: They kind of do.First, let's start with supplements. Castillo recommends that active people take collagen supplements an hour before working out, and there's certainly scientific research that supports this suggestion. One comprehensive literature review found that collagen supplements can help with wound healing and skin aging, as well as increasing skin elasticity and hydration. These results are just preliminary; a lot more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness. Be careful when searching online; many studies are performed by companies that manufacture collagen supplements, so you can't put too much stock on what they say.On the other hand, Castillo doesn't see any compelling reason to invest in skin treatments designed to increase collagen. These treatments often have a hefty price tag, and most of the supporting research is inconclusive at best. If you have the resources to spare, certain treatments might be worth a shot. Some studies have shown that microneedling (which is said to increase collagen) can treat facial scarring and stretch marks, while ultrasound therapy seems to be fairly effective for tightening and lifting facial muscles. This research is far from definitive, so consider trying collagen supplements first before you move on to advanced procedures. Read more: Do You Really Need to Take a Vitamin? 5 Things to Know Before You BuyHow can I produce more collagen naturally?
A balanced diet will help promote natural collagen production. Claudia Totir/Moment/Getty ImagesIf the world of supplements and freaky skin treatments doesn't appeal to you, you can take a more natural approach to increasing your collagen. The most effective way is through a well-balanced diet. When your body produces collagen, it uses amino acids, vitamin C, zinc and copper. To get the necessary amino acids (Castillo specifically names proline and glycine) you can eat eggs, bone broth, beans and meat. For vitamin C, go for citrus fruits, berries and bell peppers. Eat meat, shellfish, nuts, whole grains and beans for zinc and copper.If you had to choose just one food to increase your levels of collagen, it would have to be bone broth. When you simmer beef, chicken or fish bones in water, the collagen and other minerals seep into the water, delivering a delicious and nutrient-dense liquid. Plan for this type of preparation: Making your own bone broth can take a day or two. More for your nutritionBest Zinc Supplements to Boost Your Immune System6 Best Hair Growth Vitamins5 Best Multivitamins for Men6 Best Vitamins for Hair, Skin and Nails8 Best Vitamin D Supplements to Take This WinterBest 5 Vitamins for Energy
