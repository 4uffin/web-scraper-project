Is the Popular $599 BowFlex Bike as Good as a Peloton? I Tested Both and Here's What I Learned
You don't have to spend over $1,000 on an exercise bike to get a good workout in.
Giselle Castro-Sloboda Fitness and Nutrition Writer I'm a Fitness & Nutrition writer for CNET who enjoys reviewing the latest fitness gadgets, testing out activewear and sneakers, as well as debunking wellness myths. On my spare time I enjoy cooking new recipes, going for a scenic run, hitting the weight room, or binge-watching many TV shows at once. I am a former personal trainer and still enjoy learning and brushing up on my training knowledge from time to time. I've had my wellness and lifestyle content published in various online publications such as: Women's Health, Shape, Healthline, Popsugar and more. Expertise Fitness and Wellness

CNET key takeawaysMore affordable than other exercise bikes at $600Access to the JRNY app and third-party apps like PelotonWarranty lasts for up to 10 yearsBowFlex IC SE Bike
$599 at Portland Fitness Equipment
If you're on the hunt for an affordable exercise bike, the BowFlex IC SE is worth considering. It's one of CNET's top-tested bikes and a solid Peloton alternative, offering a similar experience without the steep price tag.At $600, half the price of a Peloton bike, you'll get a bike that offers a smooth ride and over 100 resistance levels. Although it doesn't have a large touchscreen like the Peloton, you can access classes through a tablet using the JRNY app. The BowFlex IC SE has a 7-inch LCD screen, which can give you a reading on resistance, speed, watts and burn rate. Adjusting resistance on this bike is simple -- just turn the knob under the handles. It may not be as high-tech as some competitors, but it gets the job done and even includes a pair of 3-pound dumbbells.
The 7-inch LCD screen on the BowFlex IC SE bike. BowFlexIf you're familiar with JRNY, it's the fitness app compatible with BowFlex products that gives you access to hundreds of group fitness classes, which include cycling workouts. You'll get the first two months free, followed by your choice of a mobile-only membership ($11.99 monthly or $100 yearly) or the All-Access membership ($19.99 monthly or $149 yearly). If you want to try a Peloton class, this bike lets you connect to third-party apps like the Peloton app through your tablet. You can also use other fitness apps such as Explore the World and Zwift.My experience using the BowFlex IC SEWhile this bike is simple enough to assemble on your own, having an extra pair of hands helps. Unlike most spin bikes with a front flywheel, this one has it in the back, which can make moving it around your home a bit trickier if you plan to wheel it between locations.You may also want to spend a little extra to swap out the seat. The stock seat isn't very comfortable, but BowFlex sells an "extra comfort" option for $40.
BowFlexI'd used the JRNY app before, so I already knew what to expect from the BowFlex IC SE bike's cycling classes. They're all on-demand, letting you join any class whenever you want. Even with the $20 monthly All-Access membership, it's still cheaper than Peloton's equivalent at $44 a month.One of the downsides of this exercise bike is that it doesn't stream third-party music, so if you have a Spotify or Apple Music account, you can't listen to your playlists while riding this bike. The only option you have is the music offered through JRNY Radio. After several rides on this bike, I appreciated how easy it was to pick classes of different lengths and fitness levels. I also liked having the option to ride solo, and with my wireless earbuds and Spotify on my phone or tablet, listening to my own music was simple.This is a solid budget bike if you're after something without all the bells and whistles but still want to cross-train or stay active at home. You can use the Peloton app for a semi-Peloton experience without the higher price tag or mandatory membership. Its sleek design also helps it blend in, whether you keep it in the living room, bedroom, garage or basement.One thing to keep in mind: With potential tariffs looming that could drive up the cost of items like exercise equipment, now might be the best time to buy this bike before newer inventory comes in at higher prices.Best Peloton Alternatives of 2025 as Tested by a Fitness Expert

The specs Product dimensions: 54.7" L x 21.5" W x 52.8" HMax weight capacity: 330 poundsResistance: 100 magnetic levels of resistanceScreen size: 7-inch color LCDWarranty: Frame: 10 years; Mechanical parts: 2 years; Electronics: 1 year; Labor: 1 yearPrice: $600CNET's buying adviceBowFlex is a reliable brand that makes exercise bikes, weight training equipment, treadmills and ellipticals. At CNET, I've tested various BowFlex products, and in my experience, they're solid pieces of fitness equipment to have in your home. What's great about BowFlex is that you can look out for sales throughout the year, usually around holidays like Labor Day, Memorial Day or the holiday season, to get some of its equipment deeply discounted. You also don't have to resort to the BowFlex site and can check the company's storefront out on Amazon, which also participates in some of these holiday discounts. If it's in your budget, sometimes it's best to pay extra so the assembly ($300) is included and you don't have to worry about putting together the equipment yourself. Ultimately, we like that you can make this bike the experience you want it to be, whether it's a solo ride or a class you're following, without the commitment of paying a Peloton bike price. With the JRNY app, you'll also have access to mat classes similar to Peloton, such as HIIT, yoga, kettlebell, strength training and more. So you'll have plenty to choose from and map out your workouts for the week.
