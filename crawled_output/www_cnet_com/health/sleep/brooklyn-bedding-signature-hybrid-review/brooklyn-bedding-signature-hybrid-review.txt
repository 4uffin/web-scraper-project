Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid FAQs
2024
If you ask me for one mattress that definitely offers good value for money, I'd pick the Brooklyn Bedding Signature . I've been a fan of this bed since I first started testing Brooklyn Bedding's mattresses (and the many other online mattress brands whose products have made it to CNET's warehouse).The mattress has a durable coil design, responsive, comfortable foams and a choice of three different firmness styles. The Signature is also affordable, and it outperforms a lot of other basic mattresses on the market right now. I frequently recommend this bed to people in my personal life, and I think you'll like it, too.Brooklyn Bedding offers a wide selection of mattresses, and you're likely to find one that fits your needs in the brand's lineup. It makes these mattresses at its massive factory in Phoenix, Arizona, which I was lucky enough to tour and see how its beds get made. So, if you're like one of the 46% of US adults interviewed in a CNET study who are willing to invest in a better mattress, you may want to consider the Signature.First impressions of the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress
Dillon Lopez/CNETSeveral versions of the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress come through the CNET team's office, and the mattress' look has never changed. While it isn't the most luxurious-looking mattress I've ever seen, its comfort is apparent the moment I lay down on it. The soft, responsive top layers of foams combined with the coils provide gentle bounce with plenty of pressure relief and give the Brooklyn Bedding Signature an almost universally comfortable feel. I was even more impressed after initially testing the Brooklyn Bedding Signature after learning that it comes in three different firmness options. Its low price hasn't increased much over the years, as I've seen with other mattress brands.Video: Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress reviewWatch me review the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress.Is the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress right for you?For anyone looking for an affordable, comfy hybrid bed, the Brooklyn Bedding Signature is hard to beat. It competes on price with beds made entirely of foam, and most of the time, beds that use coils are more expensive than beds that use foam for support.
Dillon Lopez/CNETAlso beds that are this affordable rarely offer multiple firmness options which is a compromise that people often have to make with lower-cost mattresses. I recommend the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress to people in my personal life on a regular basis because it is very challenging to find a better value anywhere else.Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress firmness and feelBrooklyn Bedding Signature feelThe Brooklyn Bedding Signature has an accommodating, neutral hybrid feel. Think of mattress feel as a spectrum with two poles: At one end is a super responsive, buoyant and bouncy sensation, and at the other end is a dense, slow-to-respond, sink-in type of sensation, with lots of room in between.
Jon Gomez/CNETA bed like this sits right in the middle, with a nice balance that shouldn't be off-putting to anyone. That's why it's so accommodating and why everyone will likely find it comfortable. There are plenty of people who prefer a more distinct type of feel -- like a dense memory foam, which this isn't. But pretty much everyone agrees that the Signature mattress is comfortable.Brooklyn Bedding Signature firmness and sleeper typesOne of the best features of the Signature mattress is that it comes in three different firmness options, which is a rarity for beds this affordable. Normally, brands will offer a few different beds with varying firmnesses. The more affordable options are typically the firmest and the most expensive is usually the softest -- this isn't the case with the Signature.
Dillon Lopez/CNETIt comes in a soft, a medium and a firm and in our testing, we found the reported firmness from the brand to be accurate. The soft model sits at a medium-soft, or roughly a 3 out of 10, which is great for side sleepers looking for a plush mattress that provides a lot of pressure relief for your hips and shoulders. The medium model is a flat medium, and our new Mattress Smasher 9000 firmness testing device rated it at a 4.3 out of 10 which is on the low end of the medium range which means it should work fairly well for all sleeping positions, including side sleepers. The firm model is a medium-firm, or roughly a 7 out of 10. That's ideal for back and stomach sleepers and less ideal for side sleepers. So, no matter your preferred sleeping position, one of the three options for the Signature mattress should work for you.Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress constructionThe construction of the Signature mattress begins with a super thin layer of dense support foam, which is only there to give the 8-inch layer of pocketed coils a stable foundation. Pocketed coils are a bit different from traditional innersprings and have almost completely replaced innersprings in mattress design. They provide the same level of bounce and support as innersprings but behave independently and do a much better job at absorbing cross-mattress motion.
Dillon Lopez/CNETAbove the coils is a one-inch-thick layer of "VariFlex" transition foam to provide a buffer between the coils and the one-and-a-half-inch-thick layer of comfort foam above. This foam used to be called "Copperflex," which is soft but also responsive and moves with you. At the very top is a one-and-a-half-inch-thick quilted cover with additional foam. Cooling, cloud pillow-topIf you choose, you can spend up to get a pillow-top to get an additional two inches of quilting on top to make the mattress even more plush. When you get this add-on it also makes the cover cool to the touch with "GlacioTex" material. This cooling factor is noticeable and it competes with the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe in the temperature regulation category. Brooklyn Bedding Signature performanceEdge supportEdge support refers to how well the edge of the mattress holds up under pressure. Beds with poor edge support make you feel like you're going to roll off the mattress near the outer edge, and it is easy to sleep near the perimeter of the edge if you're sharing a bed with a partner or pets.
Dillon Lopez/CNETThe Signature mattress has solid edge support, and we noticed little compression on the edge. As far as I can tell, there is no construction element designed to make the edges extra supportive, but the coils do a good enough job, and I don't see a roll-off sensation being an issue for couples sharing this mattress. Motion isolationMotion isolation refers to how well the bed deadens the impact of movement on the mattress -- if you're a light sleeper who shares a mattress with someone who tosses and turns a lot, having good motion isolation is especially important. This is only average to slightly above average on the Signature. Coil beds generally perform worse in this category when compared to foam mattresses, and since the foams that this bed uses are designed to move with you while you sleep, it doesn't absorb cross-mattress motion as much as a memory foam hybrid would. This could potentially be an issue for light sleepers who wake up easily from their partner tossing and turning, but it probably isn't a dealbreaker for most people.Temperature regulationThe Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress should sleep temperature neutral which means you shouldn't be sleeping warm at night because of the mattress. If you do sleep hot, it is likely due to other environmental factors.If you are a hot sleeper who wants temperature regulation advantages then I think the optional cooling cloud pillow-top is a worthy upgrade because it really does have a strong cooling factor.Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid mattress pricing

The Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress is one of the most affordable coil mattresses on the market and with its set of features, comfort and performance it is also one of the best values. Brooklyn Bedding is always running some sort of discount year-round and you can expect to pay somewhere around $1,000 for a queen-size Signature mattress, or even less depending on the time of year.
Dillon Lopez/CNETThis price is similar to foam beds like the Nolah Original 10, Leesa Original and Puffy Cloud, and it is more affordable than competing hybrids like the Casper Dream Hybrid and Leesa Sapira Hybrid. Prices do often fluctuate for online mattresses but I haven't seen the Brooklyn Bedding Signature increase in price in a significant way since I started testing beds over six years ago. Be sure to check out our mattress deals page for the latest discounts on Brooklyn Bedding or any other mattress you may be interested in.Brooklyn Bedding mattress policiesFree shippingLike most online mattresses, this will ship right to your door at no extra cost inside of a large box (as long as you live in the contiguous United States). If you live in Canada, you can still get it shipped to you, but there will be an additional cost involved depending on where you live. Unboxing a mattress usually only takes a few minutes, and we recommend unboxing it with a friend to make the process go more smoothly.I have unboxed many beds by myself, and while it's doable, it's much more difficult.120-night trial All Brooklyn Bedding mattresses come with a slightly longer than average trial period of 120 nights in comparison to the usual standard of 100 nights. So you have roughly four months to sleep on it at home to determine if you like the mattress and if it suits your needs.Keep in mind that it can take a month or longer for your body to adjust to a new mattress, no matter how well-suited it is to your sleeping preferences. The trial period begins the day the mattress is delivered, not when you actually start sleeping on it.Return policyWithin the 120-night trial period, you can return the Signature mattress and get a refund. There is no upfront fee to initiate a return, but Brooklyn Bedding will deduct $99 from your refund, which helps facilitate the mattress pickup process. Like most brands, Brooklyn Bedding will ask you to sleep on the bed for at least 30 nights before initiating a return because no matter how nice and well-suited your new mattress is to your sleep type, your body needs a bit of time to adjust to it.WarrantyAll Brooklyn Bedding mattresses are backed by a standard 10-year warranty. This is the minimum duration of warranty you should expect for almost every mattress. How does the Brooklyn Bedding Signature compare to similar mattresses?Brooklyn Bedding Signature vs. Casper Dream HybridThe Casper Dream Hybrid is the base model coil mattress available from Casper. It has a similar style of feel when compared to the Signature, which means everyone should find it comfortable. The Dream Hybrid is more expensive, by about $300 after discount -- but it also features a zoned support design that is slightly firmer in the center third of the mattress to provide more targeted support where your body needs it most. The Dream is only available in one firmness option which is a flat medium.Casper Dream Hybrid
$1,895 at Casper
Brooklyn Bedding Signature vs. Leesa Sapira HybridThe Leesa Sapira Hybrid is another accommodating hybrid mattress with near universal comfort and a slightly firmer than a medium profile that should work well for the majority of sleepers. The top layer of foam is perforated, which helps improve the airflow. The Sapira Hybrid is quite a bit more expensive than the Signature, by about $400 after discount and it only comes in one firmness option but it has superior edge support and more coils in general so it might be a bit more durable over the long term.Leesa Sapira Hybrid
$1,999 at Leesa
Final thoughts on the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattressEver since I started testing mattresses, my opinion that the Signature is one of the best values in online mattresses hasn't changed, even though more and more mattresses get updated and new ones get released every year. It is just hard to beat a mattress that comes in around $1,000 for a queen-size after discount, with multiple firmness options, near universal comfort and an optional cooling cover. There are beds that might be nicer in some respects, but they usually cost more or require some other compromise like not having firmness options, or not having coils.
Jon Gomez/CNETIf you have a budget or around $1,000 for your next mattress then I think the Brooklyn Bedding Signature should be a strong consideration for you which is why this is one of our CNET Editor's Choice picks.You might like the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress if:You want a neutral feelYou to pick and choose your firmness profileYou are shopping on a tight budgetYou want a coil mattressYou might not like the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress if:You prefer a foam mattressYou strongly prefer a memory foam feel Other mattresses from Brooklyn BeddingBrooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe: This mattress is very similar to the Signature because it comes in the same firmness options. It uses the same types of foams, so it has the same type of feel and it also has an optional "Cloud Pillow-top." The Aurora Luxe does include extra foam material underneath the cover, and the cover is cooling by default and has a stronger cooling factor than the Signature, even with the optional cooling cover. This is consistently our top pick for hot sleepers looking for the best cooling mattress. Brooklyn Bedding Sedona Elite: This is Brooklyn Bedding's most high-end and luxurious mattress, and it has a unique construction element called micro coils. These tiny coils provide extra support and bounce but also are body-conforming. Our team has observed micro coils giving off a memory foam-type of feel that conforms to your body. But without the slow-to-respond quality memory foam usually has. Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid FAQs
