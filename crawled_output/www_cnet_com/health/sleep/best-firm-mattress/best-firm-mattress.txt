The Saatva Classic mattress in CNET's mattress testing facility.
Jon Gomez/CNETOur sleep team unanimously decided that the Saatva Classic is the best overall firm mattress. It’s a luxury bed with multiple innerspring layers that provide exceptional lumbar support. The Saatva Classic is the perfect mattress for those who want a firm mattress but don't want to sacrifice pressure relief. The comfortable pillow top makes this bed a great in-between option for people who want a firm bed but not too firm. The Luxury Firm model of the Saatva Classic scored a 5.25 out of 10 when tested by our Mattress Smasher 9000. Saatva Classic

Saatva Classic
9.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
White glove delivery and set up
Hefty construction makes it extremely durable and supportive
Lumbar support design is good for back pain
Cons
The $2,099 price tag pushes it far beyond a budget bed
$99 return fee if you don’t like it within the 365-night trial
The Saatva Classic isn’t the firmest mattress on the list but it’s a luxury bed that balances firmness and pressure relief. People looking for an extremely firm bed will want to choose the firmest model of this bed. The Luxury Firm option is good for combination and some side sleepers. However, strict side sleepers will want to choose the Plush Soft option.Why we chose this bed: The Saatva Classic is one of the nicest beds I’ve ever tested. It has the feel of a classic bed but is upgraded in all the right ways. It’s also one of the most supportive with its base innerspring, additional pocketed coil layer and zoned support system. The 3-inch European pillow top is what you’ll remember about this when it comes to feel. It’s super responsive and springy when I lie on it, as I would expect from an old-school innerspring mattress.What makes the Saatva Classic a leg up for me is that it’s available in three firmness levels (Plush Soft, Luxury Firm and Firm) and two height profiles (11.5 inches and 14.5 inches). Everyone can sleep on the Saatva Classic.Who should get this bed: Those looking for a luxury-style bed with a serious punch for support will love the Saatva Classic mattress. This bed has white-glove delivery so you don’t have to worry about setup. A 365-night trial and lifetime warranty back it. The durable hybrid construction makes it great for heavier body types.Who shouldn’t: The Saatva Classic mattress is pretty expensive at $2,099 for a queen. I think it’s well worth the money, although petite people who don’t need the added support could save their money on a less luxurious bed.Runner-up: If you’re looking for a luxury-style bed that is a little more affordable, I’d recommend the WinkBed mattress. The Saatva Classic is nicer than WinkBed, but it still feels like a fancy hotel bed.  ... Show more

Best extra-firm mattress
Plank Firm Luxe
7.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
The firmest bed I’ve ever tested
Flippable design gives you two firmness options
Best for back and stomach sleepers
Cons
Too firm for side sleepers or people with sensitive chests
Cooling cover is about $200 extra
If you want a bed that feels pretty close to how firm the floor is, you’ll like the Plank Firm Luxe mattress. It’s the firmest bed we’ve tested by far. “I used to be a strict stomach sleeper and Plank was perfect for that. Its flat, supportive surface kept my spine and neck aligned correctly and I never woke up feeling sore. I'd probably still be sleeping on Plank today if it weren't for my side-sleeping partner, who needed a much softer bed,” says Aly Lopez, sleep writer. Why we chose this bed: The Plank Firm is a hybrid mattress for firm bed lovers. It has a unique flippable design that offers you two firmness levels: firm or extra-firm. I can say without a doubt that the Plank Firm mattress is the firmest bed I’ve ever tested. But don’t just take it from me; our MS9K objectively rated the firm side a 7.1 and the extra-firm side a 9.5 out of 10. It has a responsive, neutral foam feel that everyone will like. You won’t sink into the Plank Firm Luxe mattress, which is expected from a bed that’s so firm. It definitely feels like you’re sleeping on top of it. I recommend it only for people who genuinely want the firmest bed you can get. The Plank Firm mattress has only a 120-night trial period but it has a 10-year limited warranty.Who should get this bed: I’d recommend the Plank Luxe to strict back sleepers and some stomach sleepers who want a truly firm bed. It’s the firmest mattress we've tested to date.Who shouldn’t: Stomach sleepers with sensitive breasts and side sleepers will want to stay far away from this bed. The name really says it all.Runner-up: The Plank Firm Luxe isn’t what I would consider a budget bed at just slightly more than $1,500 for a queen. The Plank Firm mattress is the basic tier bed from Plank that’s also extremely firm and is about $1,300. Regular sales drop the price to less than $1,000.  ... Show more

Best cheap firm mattress
Dreamfoam Doze
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great quality for only $240
Three firmness options, although firm bed lovers will want the thinnest
Cons
We noticed an off-gassing smell when we unboxed it
Not supportive enough construction for heavy people
It’s nothing fancy
Not everyone wants to spend a ton on their next bed. The Dreamfoam Doze offers a super affordable all-foam option for those on a budget. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles other beds might have but that’s part of the charm. Why we chose this bed: The Dreamfoam Doze mattress surprised many team members during testing. At only $240 for a queen, I was surprised by the quality and comfort of this bed. It’s the best budget firm mattress you can get. It has an accommodating neutral foam feel that appeals to most people. And when I say a neutral feel, I mean the foam doesn’t feel thick and syrupy like Tempur-Pedic and not super bouncy like latex foam. It’s the type of feeling that everyone can agree is comfortable.This all-foam mattress is available in three thicknesses: 7, 9 or 11 inches. The thicker the constructions go, the softer they get. People who want a firm budget bed should stick with either the 7-inch (firm) or the 9-inch (medium-firm). With this bed, you get 120 nights to decide if it’s right for you. It’s not the longest I’ve seen, but still enough time for most people. You get a 10-year limited warranty.Who should get this bed: People on a tight budget who want a no-fuss bed that does the job will like the Dreamfoam Doze. It’s also an excellent value for guest rooms at only $240 for a queen.Who shouldn't: The Dreamfoam Doze isn’t the best long-term option for heavy people because it lacks the advanced support that other beds like Saatva have. For the price, it’s not a terrible deal, you just might be buying another bed sooner than you’d like.Runner-up: If you’re on a budget but need the supportive coils of a hybrid mattress, the Dreamfoam Hybrid mattress is an excellent alternative. It’s a little more expensive but it’s still an insanely affordable bed for the quality.  ... Show more

Best firm memory foam mattress
Nectar Classic
7.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
A good value for the money
Available in a hybrid option
Dense memory foam feel for memory foam lovers
Cons
Only one firmness option
Too firm for most side sleepers
The new Nectar Classic mattress is an affordable memory foam bed that we think is about a medium-firm or 7 out of 10. That puts it in a sweet spot of being firm, but not so firm that the average person wouldn’t like it.“We always loved the Nectar Classic, but it got even better with the latest update,” says Wes Ott, senior video producer.Why we chose this bed: If you’re familiar with the past version of the Nectar Classic, you know how dense and cradling the bed traditionally was. While I would still describe the new Nectar Classic that way, the team noted during testing that the middle foam layer balances out the dense top layer. It’s still the memory foam you love; it’s just a tad less dense than it used to be. This makes this bed more widely appealing for people looking for memory foam.The new Nectar Classic also has an updated look. The cover is softer and more breathable than the old version. The Nectar Classic mattress isn’t the firmest memory foam bed out there but I think the medium-firm level makes it a good option for more people. This bed has a 365-night trial, which is about as generous as it gets. It’s also backed by a forever warranty.Who should get this bed: People looking for a firm memory foam mattress that provides support but isn’t super firm will like the Nectar Classic. It’s not the firmest bed but that’s good for most stomach and back sleepers. The dense memory foam also scores points for people with breasts who sleep on their stomachs.Who shouldn’t: Most side sleepers will find the Nectar Classic too firm to sleep comfortably. Maybe select heavy side sleepers who like a firmer mattress but I wouldn’t take the gamble if I were you.Runner-up: For people who want an all-foam mattress for less money, the Bear Original is a good second option. It’s a little softer than the Nectar Original but it’s still a good option for back, stomach and combo sleepers.  ... Show more

Best firm mattress for hot sleepers
Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
The cooling cover is obviously cool
Multiple firmness options mean anyone can sleep on this bed
Hefty hybrid construction is very supportive
Cons
Cooling technology isn’t necessary unless you sleep hot.
$1,865 is out of budget for many
Without question, the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe is the coldest bed I’ve ever tested. This bed is available in three firmness levels so every type of hot sleeper can sleep on it. Back and stomach sleepers will want the firmest option.Why we chose this bed: I’m a huge fan of the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe mattress. It’s the best firm mattress for hot sleepers because it’s one of the only beds that actually cools you. It’s also super comfortable. It has a neutral foam feel that you can sink a little bit into but it’s nothing like the slow-moving foam of Tempur-Pedic. You can add a pillow top if you want more of that feel.Like the Saatva Classic, the Aurora Luxe offers three firmness choices. The firmest option is around medium-firm, or 7 out of 10 on our scale, giving it a nice balance of support and pressure relief. It’s not the cheapest bed out there but the high-quality construction and cooling technology make it a must-have for hot sleepers. This bed has a 120-night trial that lets you decide if it’s right and a 10-year limited warranty.Who should get this bed? Hot sleepers need this bed. It’s my ultimate recommendation because it has a cooling cover that actually works. Once you touch it, you’ll see.Who shouldn’t: If you’re not a hot sleeper, you shouldn’t get this bed because you’ll spend money on cooling features you don’t need.Runner-up: If you’re looking for a budget cooling option, I’d suggest the Cocoon Chill mattress. You can also feel the cooling cover when you lie on this bed. Stomach and back sleepers should choose the firmest option of this bed.  ... Show more

Best organic firm mattress
Avocado Green
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Eco-friendly and sustainable materials
Long list of green certifications
Latex foam is naturally breathable for hot sleepers
Cons
Adding the pillow top is expensive
Motion isolation could be better so there isn't so much shake across the bed
Those who want a certified organic and environmentally friendly mattress will love the Avocado Green mattress. It’s a firm bed, although the optional pillow top can give you a little cushion.Why we chose this bed: The Avocado Green mattress sets the bar for organic beds. Everything in the bed is either recycled or responsibly sourced from organic farms, which follow strict regulatory guidelines. Because it has natural latex layers, the Avocado mattress has a bouncy, responsive feel. When I say that, I don’t mean you’ll bounce around on it, but rather that the latex foam snaps back into place quickly so it’s easy to move around and switch positions on this bed. Latex foam tends to be a little firmer so stomach and back sleepers will be happy to know that this bed is indeed on the firmer side. You can add a pillow top for a little extra cushion. With the pillow top, this bed scores a 6.4 out of 10, according to our Mattress Smasher 9000. If you’re ready to try this bed out, you’ll have an entire year to decide if it’s right for you.Who should get this bed: Firm mattress lovers who want an organic bed will be hard-pressed to find a better option than Avocado Green. It has several organic and natural certifications. It’s best suited for back and stomach sleepers. Who shouldn’t: Most side sleepers will find the base Avocado mattress too firm to sleep comfortably on. You can add the additional pillow top but that increases the price from $1,999 to $2,799 for the medium and $3,599 for the plush.Runner-up: If you want to spend a little less, the My Green Mattress Natural Escape bed is our budget-friendly organic mattress pick. It’s not quite as supportive as Avocado, but it’s on the firmer side.  ... Show more

Best firm mattress for back pain
Purple Rejuvenate
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Super responsive when moving on the bed
It has a comfy pillow top feel
Zoned coil layer is great for back support
Cons
Expensive at $5,495
Too firm for some side sleepers
The Purple Rejuvenate is a hefty, hybrid bed with a zoned coil system that is great for people with back pain. However, it’s also one of the most expensive beds I’ve ever tested.Why we chose this bed: The Purple Rejuvenate mattress is one of my favorites. It has a super comfortable pillow top that feels like a dream, although you still get the hint of Purple’s unique comfort when lying on it because the GelFlex Grid is deeper in the bed. You can feel the luxury construction and design each time you touch it.The Purple Rejuvenate scores a 6.25 when objectively tested by our MS9K so it’s not the firmest bed out there. However, it does lean firm and has a really impressive construction that people with back pain will love. This bed has a targeted coil system that is slightly firmer under the back. This bed only has a 100-night trial period and a 10-year warranty, shorter than other brands on the list. That wouldn’t make me rule this bed out, but it’s something to consider if trial and warranties are a significant factor for you. Who should get this bed? The Purple Rejuvenate is the perfect luxury mattress for people who want a firmer bed but not the firmest bed. Its plush pillow top makes it universally comfortable. I’d also recommend it for people with back pain because of the targeted coil system.Who shouldn’t: I’m a big fan of the Purple Rejuvenate, and I wish I could say that everyone should get it. However, the price is a hard stop. It’s $5,495 for a queen, far past what most people want to spend on a bed. Even with sales, this isn’t an affordable bed.Runner-up: The Purple Rejuvenate is a very expensive bed. If you’re on a budget, I’d suggest the DreamCloud hybrid mattress. It’s a hefty hybrid bed with a comfy pillow top. Not to mention, DreamCloud does some of the most generous sales out there.  ... Show more

Best medium-firm mattress
WinkBed mattress
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Supportive hybrid design
Accommodating medium-firm profile for back and stomach sleepers
Four firmness options to choose from
Cons
Not the firmest bed out there
$1,799, though with sales it's a great value
For those who want a supportive bed but don’t want to give up on pressure relief, the WinkBed mattress is for you. It’s a premium mattress with a firm option that screams sturdiness."I’m not the biggest fan of firm mattresses. Instead, I lean toward something softer, like a medium-firm to medium mattress. The WinkBed is great for those who sleep on their sides and then switch to their stomach or back, like me. The pillow top gives me enough cushion when I’m on my side but the bed still gives me enough support when I’m on my stomach,” says Caroline Igo, sleep editor. Why we chose this bed: I’m a huge fan of pillow tops, and WinkBed has one of the most comfortable options out there. When you lie on it, you sink ever so slightly into the pillow top but not too far in as it’s a firmer bed. It’s one of the best options for support and comfort. WinkBed gives you 120 nights to decide if you want to keep the bed or return it. It has a lifetime warranty.WinkBed comes in four firmness options, although if you’re looking for a firmer bed you probably want to stick to the Luxury Firm or Firmer options. Our MS9K gave us an exact firmness of 5.8 of the Luxury Firm model. However, if you want even firmer, you have that option.Who should get this bed: The WinkBed is a supportive hybrid bed that I think is a really safe choice for the average shopper. Who shouldn’t: If you’re looking for a foam-feeling mattress, that’s not WinkBed.Runner-up: I think WinkBed is a good value for the money. However, budget-brand Allwell offers a pillow-top bed called the Allswell Supreme mattress for only $487. This bed has more of a distinct memory foam feel.  ... Show more

Best firm mattress for heavy sleepers
Helix Plus Luxe
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Supportive hybrid construction with thicker gauge coils
Traditional pillow-top feel
You can add on a cooling cover
Cons
Expensive at $2,499
Too firm for petite side sleepers
The Helix Plus Luxe mattress was built for burly bodies who want a firm bed. It’s a great choice if you want a traditional memory foam feel.“As a heavier individual, I seek out beds that are marketed to support larger people. This new mattress from Helix is an upgrade to its original Helix Plus mattress. Not only will it support heavy people but it will also be a great option to those who weigh less and are looking for a bed slightly on the firmer side,” says Dillon Payne, director of video production. Why we chose this bed: I first noticed the cloud-like pillow top when testing the Helix Plus Luxe mattress. It made me think of what you’d find in a fancy hotel. The Helix Plus Luxe mattress strikes a nice balance between being supportive and comfortable. I found it to be a medium-firm while testing, although heavier people will probably experience it as more like a medium. That might make it a little too soft for those looking for a super firm bed but the average person will be happy with the Helix Plus Luxe.Helix offers a 100-night trial period and a 15-year limited warranty if you decide to keep it.Who should get this bed: Those who want a supportive bed that will last will like the Helix Plus Luxe. It’s expensive at $2,499 for a queen but it’s worth the money if you’re on the heavier side.Who shouldn’t: I wouldn’t recommend this bed unless you're heavier. It’s pretty expensive, and average and petite body types just don’t need the added support. Runner-up: If you’re looking to save a little money and get a firmer bed, you can snag the Helix Plus instead. It’s a supportive option although it doesn’t have as thick of a construction as the Luxe model. But it costs only $1,499 before sales.  ... Show more

Why choose a firm mattress?
Firm mattresses are known for being extra supportive, necessary for back and stomach sleepers whose spines must stay in neutral alignment at night. Firm mattresses are also loved by those with back pain and heavier body types because these beds are made to press back and support you rather than letting you sink into their layers.The benefits of firm mattresses include: Supports spinal alignmentCan ease chronic back painSuperior durability because of the hefty support systemsLess sagging because you won’t sink into the mattress as much over timeEasier to get on and off ofFirm mattresses have a lot of benefits, though they’re not for everyone. I don’t recommend extremely firm beds to side sleepers, as that extra support and minimal sinkage into the bed can leave you with some serious pressure points Best firm mattress firmness data
There are two sides to mattress testing: The subjective and objective. A large part of mattress testing is subjective. You’ve read it through this whole review -- how a bed feels to me or how far I sunk into it. While this is a pivotal part of our testing process, the reality is that unless you have the exact same body type as me, you might experience a bed a little differently.  That’s why our CNET labs team built the Mattress Smasher 9000, a first-of-its-kind proprietary machine that helps us get objective firmness scores. Firmness is more important than ever on a best firm mattress list. Each bed on this list was objectively rated for firmness by the MS9K and compared with one another. The firmest bed we’ve tested to date is the Plank Firm Luxe mattress. It’s not for the faint of heart; it’s so firm that I would recommend it only to people who don’t want any give from their bed. I included some beds that are still considered firm but offer more pressure relief. Examples include the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe (Luxury Firm) at 4.9 or the Dreamfoam Doze at 6.8. Mattresses you should avoid
If you’re on the best firm mattress list, I have to assume you’re likely a stomach, back or combo sleeper who needs a bed that keeps their spine aligned. And if you’re this far down the list, you know which beds I recommend for exactly that. Now I'll include a few that you should absolutely avoid if you’re looking for a firm bed. There is nothing wrong with these beds, but if you’re a strict stomach or back sleeper, these beds will be too soft for your needs.Tempur-Adapt mattress: The MS9K rated this bed a 3.97, which is too soft to keep your spine aligned at night if you sleep on your back or stomach. Nectar Luxe Hybrid: At only 2.17 out of 10, the Nectar Luxe Hybrid is a nice hybrid bed for people who like memory foam, but it's not a good choice for back and stomach sleepers.Helix Sunset Luxe: This is the softest mattress the MS9K has tested to date, at only 2.1 out of 10. It’s a dream for side sleepers, though back and stomach sleepers might wake up with a painful back on it. What to consider when buying a firm mattress
Even after deciding you want a firm bed, there are still a lot of options left in the online mattress space. Only you can decide what bed best suits your needs. To help you make your decision, I’ve outlined a couple of key factors that will help you choose the best firm mattress for your needs.FirmnessYou know you want a firm bed. That’s one of the most important things to figure out when searching for your mattress. But you’re not done yet. Firmness is a spectrum that includes anything medium to medium-firm (6) and up.You have to decide how firm of a bed you want. Some beds, like the Plank Firm Luxe, are like sleeping on a board with very little give. While other firm beds like the WinkBed strike a balance between support and pressure relief. Finding where you fall on the firmness spectrum is essential for quality sleep.Your body type“Firm” can mean different things to different people, especially based on your weight. Your body type plays a huge role in how you experience a bed. It’s what makes firmness so subjective. Even with our MS9K data, you will still experience a bed slightly different from someone else. It’s not a big difference, but every little bit counts when searching for your dream bed.Your body weight determines how much pressure you put on the bed. Petite people put less pressure on the bed, making it feel firmer to them. Larger body types will put more pressure on the bed, so it will feel slightly softer to them. One caveat I’ll add about firmness is for stomach sleepers. The general advice is for stomach sleepers to choose firm mattresses to keep their spine aligned. However, if I’m being honest, that advice was developed by men for men. Women have to consider chest comfort when shopping for a firm mattress. Everyone varies in chest sensitivity, but it’s something to keep in mind.Sleeping positionIf you’re looking for a firm mattress, I’m going to assume you’re a back, stomach or combo sleeper. Most side sleepers find firm mattresses uncomfortable.Back and stomach sleepers: These sleepers need firmer beds (you choose how firm) to keep their spine in a neutral position at night. If a bed is too soft, you can sink inconsistently into the bed, which can cause back pain.Side sleepers: Truly firm mattresses are generally too firm because side sleepers need cushion and give around the shoulders, hips and knees to avoid pressure points. If you’re a side sleeper, it’s best to stay on the lower side of “firm.”Combo sleepers: These sleepers have the most flexibility, though it’s best to choose your firmness level based on the position you spend the most time in.Mattress typeThere are firm mattresses in every construction category. From memory foam to hybrid to latex, you have options. The type of mattress you want largely depends on how you want it to feel. If you like foam, you can choose between dense memory foam like Tempur-Pedic or a more neutral foam that’s easier to move around on. Or maybe you want a pillow top hybrid. It’s ultimately up to you. The only bit of advice I would give here is that I recommend that heavier folks get a hybrid bed with coils. It’s going to stand up to the test of time better. All-foam beds can sag and cave in over the years, which isn’t an issue for petite or average people. That doesn’t mean you can’t get memory foam; many hybrid beds have traditional memory foam layers.Trial and warranty When it comes to online mattresses, sleep trials are essential. They allow you to order a bed, try it out, and have the freedom to return it if it doesn't work. Trials are a necessity. The average trial length is 120 nights (around four months), though some brands like Nectar and Saatva give you an entire year to decide if you want to keep your bed. Other brands are on the lower side, at 90 to 100 nights.Warranties also matter when it comes to choosing your next firm bed. While they don’t protect you against stains, they cover if your mattress has a defect like a popped coil or split seams. Every mattress brand has a warranty. The average range is 10 to 25 years, though some brands offer lifetime warranties. One note on warranties is that many of them have a stain clause in them. This means that even if you’re rightly covered under your warranty for a split seam or premature sagging, your claim can be denied if your bed has a stain. I recommend a mattress protector for this reason. How we test firm mattresses
CNET video producer Jon Gomez captures mattress expert Dillon Payne testing the edge support of a mattress. Aly Lopez/CNETOur nine experts have been testing mattresses and sleep accessories for years. We’ve seen it all and reviewed it all. To date, we’ve tested around 300 mattresses across the team. We take a holistic approach to mattress testing, which means that everyone is involved to ensure we represent all types of people. Our team has different heights, genders and body types.Every bed that passes through our Reno testing facility undergoes extensive hands-on testing to rate and review key performance indicators.Firmness
The Mattress Smasher 9000 testing a bed.
Dillon Lopez/CNETWe rate the perceived firmness based on our entire team’s collective experience. It involves lying on the bed in different positions, sometimes for extended periods. We’ve had team members sleep on beds for a month up to multiple years.In addition to testing it ourselves, we also use our proprietary Mattress Smasher 9000 to deliver objective firmness metrics. We always test a bed first before we get the MS9K, that way the objective data doesn’t cloud the subjective experience of sleeping on a mattress. That’s the thing about beds, while it’s essential to have objective numbers to compare, our subjective experience across the team is what helps us recommend beds to you.Motion isolation
Testing the motion isolation with a glass of water on the end and flopping around. It passed. Dillon Lopez/CNETMotion isolation is how well a mattress dampens movement across the surface of the bed. It’s essential for people sleeping with a partner, kids or pets. Traditionally, memory foam does the best job at motion isolation.We have a few tests we put a bed through to assess motion isolation. First, I would lie on the bed and close my eyes. Then, a team member would move around next to me, with increasing levels of movement. We would do this in every sleeping position. The second test we use is setting a glass of water on the edge of the mattress and rolling toward it. The bed doesn't have good motion isolation if the water sloshes or the glass tips over.Edge support
Dillon Payne/CNETThink of edge support as the strength of the bed’s perimeter. Most people might not think this is all that important, though if you tend to sleep on the edge of the mattress (like me) or have mobility issues, edge support is a big deal.To test edge support, our team sits and lies on the edge of the bed and we note how much the bed gives. If I feel like we might fall off, the bed receives a poor edge support score. Traditionally, many memory foam mattresses rate lower in edge support, though it can happen across all bed types.TemperatureA lot of brands will claim that their mattresses are cooling when they really aren’t. Here’s where our established industry knowledge comes in to help you decide what’s real and what’s just marketing. Including “cooling” technology, like special foams or covers, doesn’t mean that you’ll actually feel it. Our testing rooms are all temperature-controlled, and we test beds without sheets or bedding to get as close to the real deal as possible. When we lie on each bed, we make sure we note if the bed is cooling and if we feel any of our body heat trapped while testing. What we're testing next
We’re always testing newly released and updated mattresses. Here’s a quick peek into what’s up next in our Reno office.Tuft & Needle Original HybridTuft & Needle Mint HybridHelix Plus EliteSealy Posturepedic Hybrid&nbsp;Titan Plus EliteLucid Memory Foam
Best firm mattress FAQs
How firm should your mattress be?
Firmness is subjective, which means that only you can decide how firm you want your bed to be. It will always vary by person depending on your preferences, body type and sleeping position.There are levels of firmness. Though in general, if you sleep on your stomach or back, you probably want at least a medium to medium-firm mattress or firmer. Side sleepers should typically avoid extremely firm beds.
Is a firm mattress better for back pain?
It depends on how you sleep and why you have back pain. Back and stomach sleepers will benefit from a firmer bed if they have back pain because it is supportive enough to keep their spine aligned. However, if you sleep on your side, a firm mattress might worsen things because it can cause pressure points on the hips, shoulders and knees.
What type of mattress is the firmest?
No one type of bed will always be firm. The firmness of a bed largely depends on the construction. Generally, the firmest bed types will be ones with steel coils, heavy-duty latex layers and specific dense, viscous memory foam.
What are some other benefits of a firm mattress?
A firm mattress isn't just better for back and posture support, but it can also reduce the amount of pressure on your other joints, which means reduced pain and improved sleep. Firm mattresses also mean better circulation since there's reduced pressure, improved oxygenation, reduced risk of bed sores and improved overall muscular relaxation.
