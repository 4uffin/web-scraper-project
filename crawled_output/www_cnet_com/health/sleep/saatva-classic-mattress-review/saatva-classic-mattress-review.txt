The final verdict
Other mattresses from Saatva
The average American adult takes their sleeping schedule and health very seriously. In fact, many US adults would spend up to $78 a month for better sleep without hesitation. Furthermore, a recent CNET survey revealed that 46% of Americans are willing to invest in better mattresses or bedding. If that isn't taking your sleep to the next level, we don't know what is.Let's be honest with one another, though: picking a new mattress is challenging. There are just so many options available on the market and the sheer variety, such as cooling mattresses or memory foam options, can further complicate the decision. After all, which one would best suit you and your circumstances? It's a difficult choice.But if there's one mattress I can recommend, it's the
Saatva Classic. The Saatva Classic mattress sets a high standard for luxury and support with its refined design, featuring stunning golden embroidery and a premium organic cotton cover that provides that classic innerspring feel. The mattress also offers two height profiles, three firmness options and free, complimentary white glove delivery. After six years of use, it's one of my favorites, so much so that I even bought one for my dad. In this review, I'll highlight key points to help you decide if this is the mattress for you.First impressions of the Saatva Classic
Dillon Lopez/CNETUnlike many other online brands, Saatva steps things up when it comes to shipping its beds to you. Instead of arriving at your doorstep in a big box, all the Saatva mattresses show up with complimentary white glove delivery. This means that a local delivery team brings the bed to your home full-size, they set it up for you and they even haul away your old bed at no extra cost. This was one of the main reasons I got this bed for my dad -- they did all the heavy lifting for him.When our Saatva Classic was delivered and set up at our office, we were immediately able to test it out. For a more luxurious bed, it definitely looked the part, and it also felt really premium and nice. I thought it felt very responsive but also neutral compared to a latex hybrid bed. When I hopped on, I noticed that it was a bit firmer than a medium, but I could still rest comfortably on my back, stomach and sides. It was certainly one of the nicest beds I've tried -- to this day.Watch me review the Saatva Classic mattress.Saatva Classic mattress firmness and feelWhat does the Saatva Classic feel like?
Dillon Lopez/CNETGiven how responsive the bed innately feels, we'd classify this mattress as having a traditional innerspring or pillow top feel. Since it has a base unit of innersprings for one of its main support layers, it's super springy and responsive, but the bed's pillow top helps to balance out that responsiveness with plenty of cushion.Simply put, it feels like a comfy bed that you probably grew up sleeping on, which is one of its main advantages. Lots of people are just looking for a straightforward mattress that feels familiar and comfortable, and this is exactly what the Saatva Classic provides. Older folks will probably be accustomed to the bed's traditional feel, but it's still comfortable enough to appeal to younger generations. That's right -- Boomers and Gen-Z finally have some common ground.How firm is the Saatva Classic mattress?
Jon Gomez/CNETThis mattress is available in a few different firmness levels. There's a Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, and a Firm model to consider. We have the Luxury Firm and tested it to be around a medium-firm on our scale. This firmness works fine for all sleeper types, but it ultimately might be best for back and stomach sleepers given its slightly firmer profile. Combination sleepers who prefer a firmer bed should enjoy it as well.Most side sleepers will likely find this version of the bed too firm, so we'd recommend the Plush Soft for this preference. Conversely, if you want an almost board-like level of firmness from your Saatva Classic, the Firm rendition is your best bet -- seriously, that bed is crazy firm.Saatva Classic mattress construction
Dillon Lopez/CNETThis mattress is also available in two height profiles, you've got an 11.5'' and a 14.5'' version to consider. Although the thickness of the layers will be slightly different, the design is the same, as follows:On the bottom, you've got a base unit of innersprings to provide the bed with one of its main support layers. In the middle, they're topped with a lumbar support feature.Then, you've got another layer of coils, but this time, they're individually siloed pocketed coils. These provide the bed with even more support and enhance the bed's motion isolation.Above that, you've got a layer of memory foam that runs along the center third of the bed. This provides the bed with some additional Zoned support.On top, the bed has a three-inch European pillow top for comfort that's wrapped up in an organic cotton cover.Saatva Classic mattress performance
Jon Gomez/CNETMotion isolationBased on our tests, the Saatva Classic deadens an average amount of cross-mattress movement. Its pocketed coils and center third transitional layer of memory foam help to absorb a good amount of motion from side to side. Since innersprings respond as an entire unit, they're not the best at isolating motion, but it's surprisingly not that bad on the Saatva Classic. If you're an especially light sleeper and motion isolation is a top priority when it comes to your next bed, a dense memory foam mattress, like a Tempur-Pedic, may be the way to go.Edge-to-edge supportWhen it comes to edge support, the Saatva Classic performs very well. Its dual-coil construction helps to prop you up along the perimeter, and it doesn't sag excessively at all. The foam-encased border around the innersprings on the bottom definitely helps to strengthen this bed's edges as well. If you or your partner would like to sleep close to the edges of your mattress, the Saatva Classic should provide plenty of sturdiness in this regard.TemperatureWhile the organic cotton cover on the bed is designed to provide the bed with some breathability, we wouldn't consider this to be an active-cooling bed, by any means. That said, it shouldn't excessively warm up on anyone either. It will likely sleep around the temperature neutral sweet spot for most couples out there. Keep in mind that sleeping temperature usually depends on exterior factors, not so much on the bed itself.DurabilityI'd say Saatva Classic is a super durable mattress. Given that it has not just one but two layers of coils, it will last all body types, including much heavier people, for several years to come. The average lifespan of a mattress is usually between 7-10 years, and considering the bed's quality design and construction, I'd say it could easily surpass that.Who is the Saatva Classic mattress best for?
Jon Gomez/CNETEven though this mattress could practically work for just about anyone, it will likely be ideal for a select group of sleepers. Here's who we think will benefit the most from sleeping on the Saatva Classic.Sleeping positionFor the model that we have of the Saatva Classic, the Luxury Firm, we'd mainly recommend it for primary back and stomach sleepers or combination sleepers who prefer a firmer sleeping surface. Again, if you're a side sleeper, you'll probably get more pressure relief from the Plush Soft version or another plush pillow top bed altogether. However, if you like to sleep on your sides but often switch to your back or stomach, it could work nicely for that preference as well.Body typeAs mentioned, the construction of this bed makes it supportive enough to handle all body types, including heavier people. If you're more petite or average-sized, you could also get by on the Saatva Classic, but the level of support could also be overkill for you. In that case, you could save some money by going with an all-foam mattress.Saatva Classic mattress pricing undefined SizeMeasurements (inches)Price Twin 38x75 inches$1,399Twin XL 38x80 inches$1,499Full 54x74 inches$1,999Queen 60x80 inches$2,099King 76x80 inches$2,599Cal king 72x84 inches$2,599
For a more luxurious mattress, I'd say its price point isn't half bad compared to others found online nowadays. Saatva as a brand used to never run discounts on their beds, but now they occasionally will around major holidays -- for reference, this bed might be considerably more affordable around times like Black Friday.Trial, shipping and warrantySaatva backs this bed with some of the most generous policies found within the online mattress space. Its beds ship to you for free with white glove delivery, and once it's in your possession, you get a 365-night trial period to try it at home risk-free. If you happen not to like it within that time frame, you will be charged a small return fee. On the other hand, if you decide to keep it, you're backed by a lifetime warranty. Compared to the average policy set for online beds, Saatva goes above and beyond.How does Saatva compare to other mattresses? Saatva Classic vs. The WinkBedThese are two of our most commonly compared beds. They're both pillow top beds that are very similar in regards to construction, firmness & feel. However, there are some major differences between the two. Firstly, the Saatva Classic comes with a slightly better policy set, offering white glove delivery instead of bed-in-a-box shipping, which is what the WinkBed comes with. The WinkBed mattress also comes in a variety of firmnesses, but it technically has an additional "Plus" version designed to support bigger people. The WinkBed also has a slightly softer pillow top feel compared to the Saatva Classic, and when it comes to price, the WinkBed is the more affordable choice.The WinkBed
$1,799 at WinkBed
Saatva Classic vs. DreamCloud HybridWhile these are both pillow top beds found online, this comparison is easier to make since the beds are so different. The DreamCloud Hybrid is a much more affordable option comparatively, and features more of a responsive memory foam quality. In regards to quality, the Saatva Classic is noticeably nicer and also comes with complimentary white glove delivery as opposed to standard bed-in-a-box shipping. The Saatva Classic is also offered in a variety of firmness levels, whereas the DreamCloud Hybrid is only available in one, on the firmer side.DreamCloud Hybrid
$1,531 at DreamCloud
The final verdictI'd say if you want a supportive hybrid bed with more of a traditional innerspring or pillow top feel, you like the sound of that Zoned-support feature and firmness choice and you don't mind spending up for something really quality and nice, it's worth your consideration.Listen, there's a good reason I bought this bed for my father. I think it's one of the best mattresses you can get online for the money -- not to mention he absolutely loves it. Odds are, you will, too.You might like the Saatva Classic mattress if:You want a supportive hybrid mattressYou want a traditional innerspring or pillow top feelYou like having a firmness choice with your next bedYou want a bed with a Zoned-support featureYou might not like the Saatva Classic mattress if:You're looking for an all-foam mattressYou prefer the feel of a neutral or latex foam mattressYou're on more of a strict budgetOther mattresses from SaatvaAside from the flagship Saatva Classic, there are many other options to choose from within the brand's lineup. In terms of other hybrid or innerspring mattresses, you can check out the Memory Foam Hybrid, the Latex Hybrid, Saatva HD, Saatva RX and even the Saatva Youth for your kids.The brand also offers a double-sided flippable latex foam option called Zenhaven, an adjustable air bed called the Solaire, and even a new, dense memory foam bed called the Contour5. Nowadays, there are plenty of beds within the Saatva lineup, and they're all quite nice.
Saatva Classic mattress FAQs
What is Zoned support?
Zoned support is basically a support system within a mattress to help keep your back in a neutral alignment while you sleep. In this case, it’s found within the memory foam transition layer and above the innersprings in the mattress. It’s subtle, but it will help to keep your back properly aligned at night. This gives you support under your lower back where you need it and pressure relief to the other areas of your body. If you have chronic back pain, it’s a great feature to have in your next bed.
Are Saatva beds worth the price?
There’s no secret, Saatva mattresses are all expensive. However, considering the level of quality that’s actually put into them, I’d say they’re well worth the price tag. Other more luxurious options can cost far more and aren’t worth the hype, but I don’t think that’s the case with Saatva. You’re spending up for a quality product.
Are Saatva mattresses too firm?
Many of the Saatva beds range on the firm end of the spectrum. Some Saatva mattresses do skew a bit softer towards the medium range like the Saatva RX, and even the Plush Soft version of the Saatva Classic. In regards to medium-soft beds from Saatva, they’re sadly few and far between.
Where are Saatva mattresses manufactured?
All Saatva mattresses are assembled in America.
How long does a Saatva Classic mattress last?
The Saatva Classic mattress is designed to last for 10 to 15 years under normal conditions.
