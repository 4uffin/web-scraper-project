How we tested the best sleep trackers
What to consider when shopping for a sleep tracker
For years now, we've been told that we have to get enough sleep to maintain our physical and mental health. But in reality, the quality of that sleep might be more important than the quantity. Sure, getting a solid 8 hours in bed is a good place to start, but it's no good if you aren't getting the kind of restorative sleep that your body needs. It’s all about how well your body moves through each sleep stage and whether you’re getting the kind of rest that leaves you ready to take on the day. The best sleep trackers take the guesswork out of bedtime by monitoring your habits and sleep quality before offering real insights into what’s helping -- or hurting -- your sleep.I tested a range of trackers to find out which ones actually live up to the hype. From smart rings and watches to non-wearable options that slide under your mattress, each pick on this list offers something useful. Read on to see my experience testing the best sleep trackers on the market.What is the best overall sleep tracker?My favorite overall sleep tracker is the Whoop 4.0 Band, thanks to its in-depth sleep information and personalized recommendations. With no buttons or screens on the band, Whoop looks simple at first glance. The band's five LEDs, body temperature sensors and photodiodes provide valuable insight into your sleep. A few of our CNET sleep experts have been using Whoop for months and have found it to provide the most reliable and accurate sleep data.
CNET's sleep experts say the Whoop provides reliable sleep data. Aly Lopez/CNETTaylor Leamey, senior sleep writer, tested the AI Whoop Coach and found it intuitive and a great feature if you're already interested in the band. You can ask the AI coach anything and it will give you personalized answers and insights based on your sleep data. With Whoop, you get sleep data and assistance with interpreting everything.Whoop 4.0 Band

Whoop 4.0
Best overall sleep tracker
$239 at Amazon
Wearable YesMetrics measured HRV, resting heart rate, recovery, respiratory rate, blood oxygen, body temperature, exercise and sleep performanceTrial One monthWarranty LifetimeSubscription $30 monthly (12-month commitment), $199 family membership, $239 upfront for 12 months or $399 for 24 monthsPrice $$$ Our take: The Whoop 4.0 sleep tracker is for those who want to track their sleep and their exercise. It’s for anyone who wants personalized sleep insights. It has an integrated coach that provides personalized recommendations, like when to go to bed or mindful breathing techniques, based on your sleep data. Whoop also is for those who don't want a screen to distract them at night. The review: "Of all the sleep trackers out there, Whoop gives me the most in-depth data on my sleep, strain and recovery,” said sleep writer Taylor Leamey. With Whoop’s advanced AI-powered technology and comprehensive data analysis, it is the ultimate sleep tracker. Whoop provides excellent insights and monitors key sleep metrics like sleep stages, heart-rate variability, respiratory rate and hours of sleep and restorative sleep, helping you better understand your sleep patterns. It's one of the most accurate we've tested and the battery lasts four to five days without charging. The app is more in-depth than just about any of the trackers I tested. If you're interested in the nitty gritty of how your body sleeps and responds to strain, I can't recommend the Whoop enough.I have to admit it's pretty expensive and I didn't love that there isn't a watch face on the strap. That said, the data and accuracy of Whoop make it the best sleep tracker you can get.Pros:Personalized recommendations based on your sleep dataProvides reliable sleep dataRemovable battery pack allows you to charge from your wristNo distracting screenCons: Chunky design can be uncomfortable to sleep withNo screen for those who want oneExpensive subscription plan12-month minimum commitment Additional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured: HRV, resting heart rate, recovery, respiratory rate, blood oxygen, body temperature, exercise and sleep performance Trial: One monthWarranty: LifetimeSubscription: $30 monthly (12-month commitment), $199 family membership, $239 upfront for 12 months or $399 for 24 monthsPrice: $$$

Oura Ring Gen4
Best wearable sleep tracker
$349 at Amazon
$349 at Oura
Our take: Oura Ring is an alluring, comfortable option for those who want convenient health and sleep monitoring without the discomfort of a bulky wrist wearable. Especially if you need a high-tech, lightweight device to fit into your existing wardrobe, Oura’s sleek design is snug and available in six finishes. In addition to providing overall sleep readings, Oura Ring is a great option for those who want insights into other aspects of health like stress, menstrual cycles and illness monitoring.The review: I wear my Oura Ring every day, and I often forget I even have it on. It’s become a part of my daily routine. I wake up and check my sleep score, my readiness score for the day and cycle insights. I love that it automatically tracks activity and can be integrated with apps like Apple Health, Strava and Google Fit. It has excellent battery life -- Oura claims it lasts up to seven days but I’ve found it's more like five to six days, which is still great. Over time, the Oura Ring gets to know your body and provides highly accurate insights and customized reports to help you understand your overall health and well-being. Pros:Comfortable, sleek ring design Longer battery life compared to watch trackersSleep score makes understanding sleep quality easyPersonalized health data and recommendations Comes in sizes 4 to 15Cons:$6 monthly subscription is required for most featuresDepending on the finger and hand you wear it on, the ring can easily get scratchedDoesn’t have snore detection Additional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured: HRV, resting heart rate, respiratory rate, blood oxygen level, body temperature, stress, activity, menstrual cycle and sleep performanceTrial: One month Warranty: 1-year warrantySubscription: $6 per monthPrice: $$$

Samsung Galaxy Ring
Best sleep tracker for Android users
$400 at Samsung
Our take: The Samsung Galaxy Ring is for Android users who want to consolidate their devices, track their sleep and manage their health vitals on their finger. For snore detection, the Galaxy Ring is a better option than Oura (which doesn’t have this feature). It is also great for those who want a device to automatically track workouts, activities and other health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen and temperature. The review: I found the Samsung Galaxy Ring to be just as great as Oura. The Galaxy Ring tracker measures all the same vitals as Oura, except for HRV. The Samsung ring has extra features such as snore detection and gesture compatibility. My favorite aspect of this ring is that it’s slightly lighter and thinner than Oura. I also loved that all the time I was wearing it, it never scratched once. Its charging case is beautifully designed and opens and closes for easy storage. The price is higher than Oura but Samsung lets you trade in devices to bring the price down. Pros: Comfortable, sleek and concave ring design No subscription requiredExtra features when connected with a Galaxy phoneSlightly thinner and lighter than Oura Cons: Need a newer Galaxy phone to access all featuresNot compatible with Apple devicesDoesn’t track HRV Additional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured:  Heart rate, snoring, energy, blood oxygen, stress, skin temperature, menstrual cycle, activity and sleep performance Trial: 15 daysWarranty: 1-year warrantySubscription: NonePrice: $$$

Fitbit Inspire 3
Best tracker watch
$100 at Amazon
$100 at Best Buy
Our take: The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a great sleep tracker for someone who wants to measure physical activity and sleep data without a bulky device on their wrist. This Fitbit’s sleek design, small digital screen and impressive battery life of up to 10 days is available for only $100 -- by far one of the most affordable sleep trackers. It is best for those who want to measure heart rate, blood oxygen levels, time spent in different sleep stages and overall sleep quality at night, and for those who want to track steps, workouts, calories burned and more during the day. The review: “I’ve had several Fitbit smartwatches through the years, though the Inspire 3 is by far my favorite. It’s got all the features you want but is way less clunky,” said sleep writer Taylor Leamey. The app is user-friendly and easy to navigate. You won't get any advanced insights but the Fitbit is a dependable option for those starting their sleep-tracking journey. I also appreciate that the Fitbit Inspire 3 provides a daily stress management score and offers mindfulness sessions that teach healthier ways to respond to stress. You also can't beat the price. You don't have to pay for the $10 per month subscription to use the sleep and workout tracking features, but you will need the subscription to access more advanced offerings such as workout classes, mindfulness sessions, recipes and more. For me, Fitbit is a classic option for people who want a straightforward tracker. Not to mention, Fitbit has several watch options in its lineup.Pros:Simple, slim design Long battery lifeAffordable price for Fitbit features Cons:Light from screen may be distractingNo buttons that release the bandsAdvanced features require a subscriptionAdditional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured: Respiration rate, heart rate, HRV, body temperature, menstrual cycle, stress, sleep stages and blood oxygen levels Trial: 6 monthsWarranty: 1-year warranty Subscription: Not necessary, $10 per month or $80 per year for premium featuresPrice: $

Garmin Forerunner 165
Best sleep tracker for sleep and fitness
$234 at Amazon
$250 at Garmin
$247 at Best Buy
Our take: The Garmin Forerunner 165 will be enjoyed by runners like me who require GPS to track their runs and who want insights into their sleep and recovery. With Sleep Coach, sleep score and nap detection features, Garmin tracks sleep cycles, duration, HRV, restless moments, resting heart rate and respiration rates. These metrics apply to its recovery feature, which lets me know how long I should rest between workouts. This Garmin tracker is best for those serious about their sleep and fitness.   The review: As a runner myself, I used my Garmin to train for a half marathon. It recommends workouts, slow days and amount of rest based on my vitals and restorative sleep from the night before. The watch itself is a bit bulky to sleep with but it’s something I got used to (however, I do prefer a ring tracker at night). Garmin claims the battery life is about 11 days but I use the watch every day and found it was more like 8 days. I really like its daily sleep and body battery scores and I found it to be one of the most accurate in tracking my total hours of sleep. Pros: Features include sleep score, Sleep Coach and a breakdown of sleep qualityAutomatically tracks naps and recommends an amount of sleep for the nightBattery lasts up to 11 daysCons: Doesn't take into account gender and hormone cycles when recommending amount of sleepMight not be for those looking for only sleep-tracking featuresAdditional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured: HRV, heart rate, respiratory rate, body battery, stress, activity, menstrual cycle, naps, restless movements and sleep performanceTrial: 30 daysWarranty: One-year warrantySubscription: NonePrice: $$

Withings Scan Watch 2
Best sleep tracker without a subscription
$350 at Withings
$338 at Amazon
$370 at Best Buy
Our take: The Withings Scan Watch 2 is a high-quality sleep tracker for those who don’t want to pay a subscription on top of a pricey device. I appreciate that it has a thinner, more traditional watch look. The clock’s face is conventional with a tiny screen that can display the digital time, date, steps and other health vitals. This watch is for sleepers who don’t want a distracting LED screen at night but want to check some vitals without opening the app on a phone. The review: I enjoy the look and feel of the Withings Scan Watch 2. It is unlike any other smartwatch that I have tested. Its smooth and streamlined design makes it comfortable to wear during the day and use during the night. I find its app to be user-friendly, simple and more appealing than most. Its sleep-tracking features are similar to other smartwatches on the market, but there are other in-depth health metrics, such as ECG measurements, AFib detection and body temperature during workouts. While this sleep tracker is a bit pricey, I find it worth it for the extra health features. Pros: Sleek design, similar to classic watches rather than smartwatchesVery small screen that doesn’t bother you during the night30-day battery lifeCons: Premium wristbands are an extra chargeMore expensive than other smartwatchesNotifications are sometimes hard to read on the screenAdditional details: Wearable: YesMetrics measured: HRV (coming soon), heart rate, AFib detection, respiratory rate (coming soon), breathing disturbances, blood oxygen, temperature, snoring, activity, menstrual cycle and sleep qualityTrial: 60 daysWarranty: Two-year warrantySubscription: Not necessary, $9.95 per month or $99.50 per year for premium featuresPrice: $$$

Eight Sleep Pod 3 Cover
Best mattress cover sleep tracker
$2,295 at Eight Sleep
Wearable YesMetrics measured HRV, heart rate, respiratory rate, snoring and sleep quality and sleep performanceTrial 30 nightsWarranty Two-year warranty (Standard) or five-year warranty (Enhanced)Subscription $17 per month (Standard), $25 per month (Enhanced)Price $$$$$+ Our take: The Eight Sleep Pod 3 Cover is great for hot sleepers like me who are serious about their sleep. You also need to have the budget for a pricey, luxury device. This mattress cover fits over a bed like a fitted sheet and contains a system of wires that pumps water throughout the cover. When testing, I found that it heats and cools sleepers to mimic my body’s natural temperature cycles during sleep. This high-tech product is best for those who want a nonwearable sleep tracker to help with night sweats and measure sleep stages, overall sleep quality, heart rate, HRV, breathing rate and snoring. The review: I can’t sleep without the Eight Sleep Pod 3 Cover. Its ability to heat and cool me throughout the night is unmatched. By detecting my heart rate, breathing, movement and sleep stages, it gives detailed reports in the morning on my sleep quality. It's great for temperature control, though the data can be a little wonky. I've found that my sleep scores are higher than they should be sometimes. I think sometimes it thinks I’m asleep when I’m really awake (or when my pets are in my bed). On top of that, its high price is a huge drawback. It’s for those who are significantly interested in sleep. Pros: Cooling features help hot sleepers from sweating Non-invasive way to track your sleep Autopilot automatically heats and cools to mimic natural sleep stagesCons: Very, very expensive Mattress cover changes the feel of your mattressAdditional details: Wearable: NoMetrics measured: HRV, heart rate, respiratory rate, snoring and sleep quality and sleep performanceTrial: 30 daysWarranty: Two-year warranty (Standard) or five-year warranty (Enhanced)Subscription: $17 per month (Standard), $25 per month (Enhanced)Price: $$$$$+

Withings Sleep Tracking Mat
Best non-wearable sleep tracker
$150 at Amazon
$152 at Best Buy
$200 at Withings
Our take: If you would rather not wear a sleep tracker to bed and an Eight Sleep mattress cover is outside your budget, you may enjoy the Withings Sleep Tracking Mat. This thin mat fits underneath my mattress and I didn't even know it was there. It has pneumatic and sound sensors that measure my heart rate, respiratory rate, movements, snoring and sleep cycles. It's important to note that the Withings Sleep Tracking Mat is powered through a USB cable and must be plugged in.The review: I like easily viewing my sleep data in the free Withings app through its Wi-Fi sync. The app also automatically generates a sleep diary that includes my sleep score each night. As for its tracking abilities, I did find that the Tracking Mat often picked up my dog sleeping near my pillow before I even got into bed. Keep this in mind if you sleep with a partner or a pet. I also often got higher readings with the Sleep Mat compared to other wearable sleep trackers. Devices that go on your fingers are wrists are going to be a bit more accurate but the price and ease of this Sleep Mat can’t be beat. Pros: Automatically compiles your data into a sleep diary Noninvasive way to track sleepIt can turn off lights automatically when you get into bed  Cons: If you sleep with another person, there is a chance it could pick up their movementsYou need to have an outlet nearby to plug it inMay record awake periods in bed as light sleepAdditional details: Wearable: NoMetrics measured: Snoring, heart and respiratory rate, movements and sleep qualityTrial: 30 nightsWarranty: Two-year warrantySubscription: NonePrice: $

How we tested the best sleep trackers
Caroline Igo/CNETI've been testing and assessing sleep products for years alongside CNET's sleep team. From mattresses to bedding to sleep accessories, I know which products are worth writing home about. I tested each sleep tracker on this list for a minimum of two weeks to get a full picture of how it performed. In the case of some devices, such as the Whoop, Oura or Eight Sleep, some of our experts (like myself) wear and use these every day. The selected sleep trackers were also chosen based on comfort, accessibility, metrics measured, accuracy, battery life and the supporting app.    Our sleep experts have also tested the TempurPedic Tempur-Ergo Smart Base, Oxa Breathing Coach, Eight Sleep Pod 4, Apple Watch SE, Garmin Forerunner 45S and the Garmin Forerunner 965. These products didn’t make our list because of poor sleep-tracking performance or because they were beaten out by other models. In the case of Garmin, both watches mentioned have great sleep tracking capabilities but the price and extra features of the Garmin Forerunner 165 topped the other two models. The same can be said for the newest Eight Sleep Pod 4 -- the older Pod 3 version has similar features for a better price. What to consider when shopping for a sleep trackerThe sleep tracker market has a lot of variety to choose from -- which can be overwhelming if you aren't sure where to start. Before you begin shopping for a sleep tracker, keep these features in mind.TypeBefore shopping, you should decide what type of sleep tracker is most appealing. There are lots of sleep tracker watches, but some may find them too uncomfortable to sleep with. There are also smart rings, smart mattress covers and mats that go under your bed. Additional featuresDetermining what you expect from your sleep tracker will help you narrow down your options; maybe you want a device with a screen that alerts you of your texts or you want one that fits into your wardrobe. If you want a sleep tracker that also tracks your fitness and activity, choose something like the Oura Ring 3 or Fitbit Inspire. If you are a runner who needs GPS to track your miles, then the Garmin Forerunner 165 is a great option. If you are interested in a device that tracks other health vitals and metrics in addition to its sleep-tracking features, look for a wearable that measures blood oxygen levels, heart rate, HRV, respiratory rate, temperature and other valuable health data.AccuracyAnother crucial factor when choosing a sleep tracker is its accuracy. No current device on the market is as accurate as an in-office sleep study with a doctor (a test that measures brain activity and wave patterns). Trackers with heart rate and blood-oxygen level sensors are the most reliable. PriceThe price range for sleep tracker devices varies so determining your budget first will help you narrow down your best options. It's also important to factor in the monthly or yearly subscriptions that some sleep tracker devices require. Oura has the lowest at $6 per month but Withings and Fitbit do not require subscriptions. Eight Sleep is already extremely pricey and requires a $17 or $25 subscription per month, depending on your membership. Battery lifeBattery life and charging are other factors you should consider. A sleep-tracking product that requires being charged daily or nightly can be unmanageable or unrealistic for some people. If you need a sleep tracker with a long battery life, the Withings Scan Watch 2 can go for about 30 days between charges. If you're looking at a sleep tracker that requires an outlet, such as the Withings Sleep Tracking Mat or the Eight Sleep Pod 3 Cover, that's something to consider if you don't have one easily accessible near your bed.
Best sleep tracker FAQs
Which sleep tracker is the most accurate?
I found that wearable sleep trackers are more accurate than trackers that go over or under the bed. I attribute this to the fact that wearables have better contact with your skin to measure heart rate and breathing rate. Bed trackers like Eight Sleep or the Withings Sleep Mat sometimes picked up my dogs sleeping on my bed rather than just me. I found that top sleep trackers like Whoop, Fitbit and Oura Ring are a tad more accurate.
How accurate is the Oura ring?
In an experiment where I tested Oura, Garmin and Eight Sleep consistently for a month, I found that Oura, on average, gave me the lowest sleep scores of the three. Garmin’s readings matched my perceived hours of sleep and wake periods a little more. I don’t have the right equipment to state which wearable is most accurate (a standardized, doctor-given sleep test is the most reliable), but Oura is still a great sleep tracker. It is, by far, the most comfortable to sleep with.
Are sleep trackers worth it?
Yes, sleep trackers can be worth it if you want to look into your sleep quality, performance and habits. Based on your budget and preference, you can find a sleep tracker that works for you. The best sleep trackers include watches, rings and those that go over or under your mattress.

is the best non-wearable sleep tracker. The thin mat goes under your mattress and uses pneumatic and sound sensors to measure your heart rate, movements and other tracking metrics.
What's the best sleep tracker without a monthly fee?
According to CNET's experts, the Withings Scan Watch 2 is a top choice for those who want quality sleep-tracking analytics without paying a subscription fee. The sleep tracker's thinner, more traditional watch look is an added benefit.
Can the Apple Watch detect sleep apnea?
Supported models such as Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10 and Ultra 2 can be worn to bed to track breathing disturbances during sleep. This data is analyzed using an algorithm to detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea. If elevated disturbances are detected frequently during a 30-day period, the Apple Watch will send you a notification suggesting possible sleep apnea.
How accurate is the Apple Watch sleep tracking?
The Apple Watch is widely seen as a fairly accurate sleep tracker but it's known to have some limitations. For example, the fitness tracker might struggle to distinguish between sleep stages or provide sufficient data on the quality of sleep.
