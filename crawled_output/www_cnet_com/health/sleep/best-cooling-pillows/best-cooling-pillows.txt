Best cooling pillows compared
Caroline Igo/CNETThe heat dome that’s baking the central and eastern US is bringing the hottest temperatures we’ve seen this year. Hot sleeper or not, there’s a good chance you might be looking for some relief at night. When flipping pillows and rolling over to find a cool spot on the mattress doesn't work, you might need some cooling technology.A pillow designed with cooling technology can be a game changer, especially if its tech extends beyond a cooling cover into the pillow's stuffing or foam. To find the best one, I tested dozens, considering each pillow's cooling sensation, material, feel, firmness, sleeper type, price, size and different sleeping positions.The best overall cooling pillowThe Casper Hybrid Pillow with Snow Technology made the top of my list due to its high-quality materials, comfort and truly cool-to-the-touch feel. The innovative materials used in this pillow include Casper's unique Phase Change materials, HeatDelete bands and a CoolTouch Cover, all actively working to keep you cooler throughout the night. I tested 25 cooling pillows from 20 top brands; the 12 pillows that made this list are the best cooling pillows on the market. I also included a few honorable mentions that might work better for your particular sleep setup. Best cooling pillows of 2025
Caroline Igo/CNET
Casper Hybrid Pillow with Snow Technology
Best overall cooling pillow
$104 at Amazon
The Casper Hybrid Pillow with Snow Technology is the coolest pillow I have ever tested. That's why it takes my pick for the best overall cooling pillow. Not only is the machine-washable cover cool to the touch but the inside of the pillow is made with perforated poly foam, polyester fibers and gel. It uses what Casper calls Snow Technology, which has phase-change material that remains temperature-neutral around your head and neck and allows for airflow.  The pillow is soft yet supportive, and I like how my head sinks a little into the poly foam -- but not too far. In terms of firmness, I would say it is medium, and when you press your hand into the material, it returns to its original shape a bit faster than memory foam does. So no need for fluffing. The Casper Hybrid Pillow will support back, side and combination sleepers (those that switch between positions at night).Sleeping position(s): Back, side and combination Pros:Cool to the touch; coolest pillow I tested Soft, machine-washable cover Four layers of foam, fiber and gel with Snow Technology Cons:Over $100 for one pillowNot for those who don't like foam
$104 at Amazon
Caroline Igo/CNET
GhostPillow Gel Memory Foam Pillow
Best affordable cooling pillow
$55 at Amazon
GhostBed is known for its comfortable cooling mattress, and its cooling Gel Memory Foam Pillow is no different. It's made with a perforated gel memory foam core, a layer of phase-changing materials, an inner aerated mesh and a cover that's truly cool to the touch. I like how the pillow conforms to my head and neck and feels cool on my face. Compared to other cooling and memory foam pillows on the market, the GhostPillow Gel Memory Foam Pillow is very affordable -- and not to mention, most pillows that claim to be cooling aren't as cool to the touch as GhostBed's. I think it's a great value and can support back, side and combination sleepers.Sleeping position(s): Back, side and combination Pros:Cool to the touch Machine-washable coverAffordable; GhostBed often has sales Cons:Not for strict stomach sleepersCooling cover is only on one side
$55 at Amazon
Caroline Igo/CNET
Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Cooling Pillow
Best cooling memory foam pillow
$199 at Brooklyn Bedding
The Brooklyn Bedding Luxury Pillow isn't just the winner for the best cooling memory foam pillow -- it's also the best pillow for all sleeper types. There are two lofts available: high and low. A high loft is great for side sleepers, and a low loft is meant for back and stomach sleepers. Its hexagon-patterned cover is cool to the touch and can be removed and washed. The cover extends to the other side, but the hexagon side is the coldest. The memory foam itself is perforated, and the top is infused with copper. This natural mineral helps to fight against mold, allergens and dust mites. I'm a huge fan of memory foam, and I like that this Brooklyn Bedding pillow allows me to switch between sleeping positions comfortably. Also, Brooklyn Bedding often has deals, so you can usually grab this pillow for under $99.  Sleeping position(s): Stomach and combinationPros:Cool to the touch Machine-washable coverGreat for all sleeper types Cons:Over $100 for one pillowOn the thinner side
$199 at Brooklyn Bedding
Caroline Igo/CNET
Nest Easy Breather Pillow
Best cooling shredded foam pillow
$119 at Nest Bedding
The Nest Easy Breather is one of the more supportive pillows on this list. The cover is cool to the touch, and the pillow is filled with shredded foam. If the pillow arrives too firm or too high for you, simply remove some of the fillings and fluff it back up. When it was filled to its maximum, I found that it supported my neck and head from sinking into the surface -- which is great for side sleepers who don't like the sinking feeling of memory foam. I prefer the Nest Easy Breather to be a little less filled so I can comfortably switch from my side to my back. Also, I wouldn't consider this a comfortable pillow for strict stomach sleepers, so you may have to remove almost all the fill. Check out the best cooling pillow for stomach sleepers instead. Sleeping position(s): Back and sidePros:Cool to the touchMachine-washable cover Adjustable loft  Cons:Not for strict stomach sleepersNot for those who like to sink a little into pillows
$119 at Nest Bedding

Purple Harmony
Best cooling latex pillow
$199 at Amazon
$199 at Walmart
I consider the Purple Harmony pillow to be a mini-version of the Purple Mattress. Both products contain a GelFlex grid layer that's unique to Purple. This feature is flexible, supportive and slightly molding like memory foam. The Purple Harmony pillow also has a Talalay latex (a natural latex sourced from rubber trees) core that is perforated for airflow and won't trap your body heat. The machine-washable mesh cover is slightly cool to the touch but less cool than the Casper, GhostBed or Brooklyn Bedding pillows. With the Purple Harmony, its inside materials are more important and cooling than the cover. This pillow will support back and side sleepers comfortably.     Sleeping position(s): Back and side  Pros:Cool to the touchUnique honeycombed-pattern gridSoft, machine-washable cover Cons:ExpensiveNot everyone will like the latex-grid feel
$199 at Amazon
$199 at Walmart
Caroline Igo/CNET
Bear Pillow
Best cooling pillow for back sleepers
$125 at Bear Mattress
The Bear Pillow is another great pillow for back sleepers. Its cover is cool to the touch and made with what Bear calls Double Ice Fabric. At both ends of the pillow is a mesh that allows for more airflow. It's also hypoallergenic and helps to stop mold, bacteria and dust mites. At its core, the Bear Pillow is made with a hybrid foam, which I consider halfway between bouncy latex foam and slow molding memory foam. I think it's right down the middle of too firm and too soft. It's also supportive enough for both back and side sleepers.        It should be noted that you can't wash the Bear Pillow cover. Spot-clean only and use a light, breathable pillowcase.  Sleeping position(s): Back and sidePros:Cool to the touchHypoallergenicContains perforated, hybrid foam   Cons:Not for strict stomach sleepersNot for those who don't like the bouncy feel of latex foamExpensive at MSRP
$125 at Bear Mattress
Caroline Igo/CNET
Layla Kapok
Best cooling pillow for side sleepers
$109 at Layla
$109 at Amazon
If you're a side sleeper, you should look for a pillow that's high enough to keep your neck aligned during the night. It's best to avoid using a pillow so soft that your head sinks because you'll likely wake up with neck pain. The Layla Kapok is great for side sleepers because it's high and firm enough to keep you from overextending your neck. The pillow is filled with shredded memory foam for optimal airflow, and it can even be adjusted by taking out the filling. If you are a back sleeper, just take out a bit of the Layla Kapok pillow's filling, and it should be low and soft enough for you.The fibers used in this pillow are lighter and more ventilated than cotton or wool, giving it that cooling sensation. As a side sleeper, I especially like the feel of this pillow. I like to sink a little bit, which the Layla Kapok allows, but it's also supportive enough that I don't hurt my neck during the night.    Sleeping position(s): Back, side and combination Pros:Adjustable (remove filling to your liking)Plush and supportive Soft, machine-washable coverCons:Not cool to the touchNot for strict stomach sleepers

Cozy Earth Silk Pillow
Best cooling pillow for stomach sleepers
$363 at Cozy Earth
Pillows for stomach sleepers are sometimes hard to come by. They must be supportive and low enough that you don't overextend your neck at night. The Cozy Earth Silk Pillow is a great example of a pillow that supports the neck and is low enough for strict stomach sleepers. Made of bamboo fabric and 100% mulberry silk, this Cozy Earth pillow uses the lightest and coolest materials to keep you from overheating at night. And you can feel it. I love how soft it feels to the touch. While the cover isn't cool like the Casper, GhostBed or Brooklyn Bedding pillows, the Cozy Earth Silk Pillow makes up for it with quality. Its premium materials prevent pilling, making the pillow last a long time. I think this pillow would also be comfortable for back and combination sleepers.    Sleeping position(s): Stomach and combination     Pros:Filling is 100% mulberry silkCover is 100% bamboo fabric Only made with breathable materials Cons:Not cool to the touchMost expensive

Caroline Igo/CNET
Coop Eden Cool Plus Pillow
Best adjustable cooling pillow
$105 at Coop
Coop Sleep Goods has recently become popular for its cooling products. Its Eden Pillow continues to top lists of cooling pillows, and if you thought that pillow was cool -- it got even better. The Coop Eden Cool Plus Pillow is the newer, cooler version of the Eden Pillow. This pillow has a similar cool-to-the-touch cover and now features a heat-wicking inner liner, a gel layer and shredded gel-infused memory foam. The filling is Greenguard Gold and CertiPur-US certified. One side claims to be cooler and firmer than the other, but I didn't feel that when testing.   One of the best features of this pillow is that it's adjustable. It comes with extra filling, as well as an option to pull the filling out. Make it as firm or soft, high or low as you desire. I filled mine with a little more than the way it came. I like that the memory foam contours and lets you sink a little into the pillow, regardless of how much you fill it.  Sleeping position(s): Back and sidePros:Cool to the touch Adjustable and hypoallergenic Machine-washable cover Cons:Not for strict stomach sleepersNot for those who don't like to sink a little into pillows

Birch Organic Pillow
Best organic cooling pillow
$149 at Birch
If you're conscientious about your bedding and where the material comes from, look no further than Birch. This brand is organic, eco-friendly and natural. Birch's Organic Pillow is made with a 100% organic GOTS-certified cotton cover, and while it isn't cool to the touch, it's breathable. The core is made of a 100% organic cotton outer layer filled with shredded latex. That core is then wrapped with 100% organic, GOTS-certified wool that helps to wick away moisture. I love that this pillow doesn't feel lumpy, and it would be very supportive for back and side sleepers.Sleeping position(s): Back and side     Pros:GOTS and Eco-Institut certifiedContains Fair Trade cottonAll materials are natural and organic Cons:Not cool to the touchOver $100 for one pillow
$149 at Birch
Caroline Igo/CNET
Sleep Number True Temp Classic Pillow
Best supporting cooling pillow
$110 at Sleep Number
The Sleep Number True Temp Pillow comes in three shapes: classic, contour and ultimate. I tested the classic for this review, which is best for back sleepers. If you're a side sleeper, I recommend the contour and all sleeper types should like the ultimate, as it can be customized to fit any sleeper. Regardless of the shape, the Sleep Number pillow is cool to the touch and contains 37.5 technology, which refers to material embedded with volcanic minerals that wick away moisture.The fill is 100% foam, and I think it feels like a poly foam that isn't too soft. It supports your head and neck without sinking too much into the foam.     Sleeping position(s): Back   Pros:Cool to the touchComes in classic, contour and ultimate shapesSoft, machine-washable cover Cons:Not for strict stomach sleepersSide sleepers should choose the contour shape
$110 at Sleep Number
Caroline Igo/CNET
Saatva Latex Pillow
Best soft cooling pillow
$165 at Amazon
The softest and thinnest pillow on this list belongs to the Saatva Latex Pillow. It's available in two lofts: standard and high. Back and stomach sleepers should go with the standard loft, while side and combination sleepers should choose the high loft. For this review, I tested the standard loft. This pillow reminds me of a luxury hotel pillow that isn't overstuffed with filling. It is made with a cotton cover (that isn't cool to the touch) and filled with certified organic cotton, plush, down-like fibers and a shredded natural latex core. The material is breathable and hypoallergenic, which fights bacteria, mold, mildew and dust mites. The cotton cover is also machine washable.
Sleeping position(s): Back, stomach, side and combinationPros:Shredded natural latex coreMachine-washable, Fair Trade Certified cotton coverAvailable in standard and high lofts Cons:Not cool to the touchNot for those who don't like thinner pillows
$165 at Amazon
How we tested the best cooling pillowsDuring my testing, I considered each pillow's cooling sensation, material, feel, firmness, sleeper type, price and size. I then slept on each pillow for one to two nights (in addition to daytime-lounging testing). I'm a side sleeper, but I also tried different sleeping positions with each cooling pillow to determine the most comfortable sleeping position. You won't find a pillow that will stay ice cold for the entire night (at least not yet), these cooling pillows contain temperature-neutral materials that won't retain any of your body heat. Some have a cool-to-touch feel that I've noted below, but be aware that the pillow won't feel that cool all night. It's worth mentioning that the pillowcase you use will affect the cooling sensation of any pillow. If you're a hot sleeper and use flannel or heavy material pillowcases, I suggest switching to silk, bamboo or cotton if you want the most out of your cooling pillow. Other cooling pillows tested
Caroline Igo/CNETHere are my honorable mentions. While these pillows didn't make my initial list, I still wanted to highlight these five for some of their cooling features. One of these pillows might work best for you.
Caroline Igo/CNET
Nolah Adjustable Shredded Foam Pillow
$89 at Nolah
The Nolah Adjustable Shredded Foam pillow is my favorite of the honorable mentions. This pillow is made of shredded foam that can be taken out and adjusted to your liking. Its cover is soft, machine-washable, and made of Oeko-Tex-certified bamboo blend fibers. The best part is that one box comes with two queen-size pillows. I found the pillow to be between the soft Helix pillow and the firmer Marlow pillow below. You sink into it, but not too much. My only complaint with this pillow is that it's not cool to the touch, and some sleepers might find it too lumpy.  Sleeping position(s): Back and side
$89 at Nolah
Caroline Igo/CNET
Brooklinen Marlow Pillow
$37 at Brooklinen
I sleep on Brooklinen sheets every night, so I'm a big fan of the brand. This was the first Brooklinen pillow I've ever tested. The Marlow Pillow is made of memory foam and polyester fiber, and the outside cover is made of 100% cotton. You can't remove any filling to adjust the firmness to your liking, the pillow comes with two zippers (one at the top and one at the bottom) that do just that. You won't notice a huge difference.I found the Marlow Pillow to be more supportive than a pillow made with shredded memory foam. You won't sink, but it might be too firm for some sleepers. Sleeping position(s): Back and combination
$37 at Brooklinen
Caroline Igo/CNET
Lagoon Otter Pillow
$140 at Lagoon
The Lagoon Otter Pillow is the definition of versatile. The fill is made with shredded gel-infused memory foam, and the cover is polyester and bamboo. While the pillow arrives prefilled with foam, there's extra foam available and an extra pouch for any fill that you wish to take out. The pillow feels soft, but it's not cool to the touch. Lagoon claims that this pillow is for all sleeper types, but my testing didn't agree. It is great for back and side sleepers, but to sleep comfortably on your stomach, you would have to take out nearly all the fill.

Sijo Support Pillow
$94 at Sijo Home
The Sijo Support Pillow is for those who like pillows that are firmer, bouncy and supportive. It isn't for memory foam lovers -- like myself. The inside is made entirely of perforated Talalay latex foam, and the outside shell is made of a blend of eucalyptus fibers. The pillow is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified, hypoallergenic and made of environmentally sustainable materials.It isn't cool to the touch, but the pillow is made of all the right temperature-neutral materials. My head hardly sinks at all on top of this pillow. It's also a light pillow for how dense it feels.  Sleeping position(s): Back and side

Factors to consider when choosing a cooling pillowSleeping positionDifferent sleeping positions require different types of pillows. Stomach sleepers should look for softer and thinner pillows, while side sleepers need a firmer and higher pillow. Back sleepers require a pillow that is somewhere in the middle.PricePillows can be expensive. Oftentime, you can find a great foam pillow for around $50 to $100. Pillows with higher-quality materials (such as silk or bamboo) may well be over $150 or $200. Regardless, stick to your budget. MaterialThe best cooling pillows will be made out of latex, foam, silk, cotton or bamboo. Steer clear of pillows made solely of non-gel, non-perforated memory foam, as this material will retain heat.HeightPillows with a high loft (about five inches) are made for side sleepers. If you are a stomach or back sleeper, look for pillows that have a low loft or height (under five inches). SizeWhile the average pillow comes in a standard size, you can often choose a queen or king size. Best cooling pillows compared

Best cooling pillows FAQs
Do cooling pillows really work?
Some cooling pillows claim to stay cool all night, but this is rarely the case, even for those that feel cool to the touch. It's what's inside the pillow that is doing the work -- not the cooling cover layer. These types of pillows use a material that won't retain body heat and remain temperature-neutral. The cool-to-the-touch cover is an added bonus and may keep you feeling cool for a while, but it will eventually fade. Its filling will keep you from sweating during the night.
What is the coldest pillow on the market?
Out of all the pillows that I tested, I found that the
is the coldest pillow on the market. It made the top of my list due to its high-quality materials, comfort and truly cool feel.
How do I keep my pillow cool all night?
There's no such thing as a pillow that will stay ice cold all night long, but there are a few things you can do to ensure it stays as cool as possible at night. One, make sure your cooling pillow has the right pillowcase on it. I suggest using a bamboo, silk or light pillowcase to truly feel the cool cover. This material also won't retain body heat. Secondly, you can freeze your pillowcases and even your sheets before you go to bed. Lastly, choose a pillow that's made of perforated foam, gel, latex, bamboo, silk or cotton.
Should I put a pillowcase on my cooling pillow?
Yes, using a pillowcase is essential for maintaining your pillow’s longevity, by keeping your pillow clean and protected. If you're worried that adding a pillowcase to your cooling pillow will lessen its cooling effects, take a look at some of the best cooling sheets.
How often should I replace my cooling pillow?
Most cooling pillows should be replaced every couple of years, depending on the quality of the materials and how well you maintain them. Memory foam and latex cooling pillows typically last longer, up to three years. Your pillow will show some signs when it's time to replace it, like decreased cooling effect, noticeable lumps or flattening, persistent odors despite cleaning, visible staining or waking with new neck pain or headaches. To extend your cooling pillow's lifespan, use a protective pillowcase, wash the cover regularly according to manufacturer instructions and avoid folding or crushing the pillow during storage.
