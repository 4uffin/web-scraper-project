Beautyrest mattress FAQ
According to a CNET survey, 46% of US adults are willing to invest in a better sleep setup. If that's you, and you're looking for a high-quality, comfortable and durable bed, then we've got you covered.Beautyrest is known for its mattresses that provide ample support for all kinds of sleepers. Premium options like memory foam, gel-infused layers and individually wrapped coils (specifically designed to enhance sleep quality and regulate your temperature) are available.Of course, if you don't have the budget for one Beautyrest's premium mattresses, don't worry. The brand also offers more affordable mattresses that shouldn't be ignored, as they're also designed with comfort in mind. So, whether you sleep on your stomach, side or back, you're sure to find a mattress that suits your needs.
The pillow-top model from the Beautyrest Black collection. BeautyrestFirst impressions of Beautyrest mattresses
Black Collection: The Beautyrest Black Collection is made up of two premium mattresses made with premium materials like silk, cashmere and comfortable Beautyrest foams. These are thick mattresses with individually wrapped coils. The Black model has a light and airy pillow top, while the Black Hybrid has a memory foam topper and cooling technology. Harmony Collection: The Harmony collection includes three mattresses. The Harmony is an entry-level mattress with a competitive price comparable to similar hybrid beds. Then there's the Harmony Lux and Harmony Lux Hybrid, more premium models with extra support and enhanced cooling technology. The major difference between these two is the pillow top options; quilted or memory foam. Pressure Smart Collection: The previous two collections are the brand's bread and butter and will be the primary focus of this Beautyrest mattress review, but the Pressure Smart Collection includes the Pressure Smart mattress. It's a cooling mattress available in two different profiles (standard and hybrid), and it retails for a very affordable price. The standard is even less expensive than popular foam mattresses like the Casper Original and the Nectar, but it's made with strong individually wrapped coils. Designer Collection: This collection is a collaboration between Beautyrest and renowned interior designer Nate Berkus. It includes a premium hybrid mattress and different bedding accessories, including a mattress protector and a luxurious down pillow. Read more: Best Mattress of 2025Beautyrest mattress feel and firmness levels
Beautyrest Harmony Lux mattress Wes Ott/CNETHow firm are the Beautyrest mattresses? Beautyrest mattresses come in a range of firmness levels, from plush to firm, and with or without a pillow top. Ultra Plush Beautyrest mattress models will primarily be for side sleepers or petite folks who need the softest of the soft. It's rated around a 1-2 on the firmness scale out of 10. Plush Beautyrest mattress models are still on the soft end of the spectrum, around 3-4. Soft mattresses from Beautyrest will be best for side sleepers, and petite combination sleepers under 230 pounds.Medium Beautyrest mattress models should fall around a five on the spectrum, accommodating all sleeping positions. Firm Beautyrest mattress models should fall around a 6-7 on the firmness scale, making them best for heavier combination sleepers over 230 pounds, back and stomach sleepers. Extra Firm Beautyrest mattress models are the firmest profiles you can get. I recommend this model primarily to heavy back and stomach sleepers. If you're under 230 pounds, you may find this model a little too firm. What does a Beautryest mattress feel like?
Beautyrest Black mattress Jon Gomez/CNETThe feel of your Beautyrest mattress will depend on the model you choose. Pillow-top mattresses feel more light and airy and respond quickly to pressure. The models within each collection with the word "Hybrid" in their name are designed with extra memory foam, giving those mattresses a prominent hugging and contouring feel. Memory foam beds feel like the top comfort layer is giving you a hug as it molds around the curves of your body. If you opt for a Beautyrest mattress that comes without a pillow top, you'll get more of a blended foam feel. You get the pressure-relieving benefits of memory foam, but it's also more responsive to pressure than traditional foam. Beautyrest mattress constructionsBlack Collection

There are no pillow top options here -- your topper is memory foam.Harmony Collection

BeautyrestBeautyrest mattress performance
Testing edge support on the Beautyrest Harmony Lux mattress. Jon Gomez/CNETMotion isolationBeautyrest mattresses are all premium beds and will be good at isolating motion across the mattress. The best ones will be the Beautyrest Hybrid models, like Beautyrest Black Hybrid, because they have memory foam top layers that are notoriously good at absorbing motion.Edge supportThe perimeter of your mattress should be sturdy enough to make you feel supported while you're lying or sitting on it. The Beautyrest mattresses are made with steel individually wrapped coils, making the beds sufficiently supportive all the way around. DurabilityHybrid mattresses that utilize both foam and steel coils tend to be more durable and last around eight to 12 years, depending on how well you take care of your mattress. You can expect the shelf life of a Beautyrest mattress to fall within that range thanks to its durable, supportive constructions.Off-gassing All Beautyrest mattresses are hand-delivered to you via white glove delivery. There's no unboxing or unrolling needed like bed-in-a-box mattresses. This means your mattress will not omit an off-gassing smell when you receive it. This is one perk of buying from a luxury brand, as they typically offer a white glove delivery service. Who should sleep on a Beautyrest mattress?Position
Soft beds are typically best for side sleepers because they provide more contour underneath shoulder and hip pressure points.  CNETSide sleepers should opt for Beautyrest mattresses that offer firmness levels in between Ultra Plush and Medium. Smaller side sleepers under 150 pounds may like the Ultra Soft model, but most other side sleepers will appreciate Plush and Medium for the extra supportiveness. Back and stomach sleepers should pick a Beautyrest mattress that offers a firmness level between Medium and Ultra Firm. I primarily recommend Ultra Firm to heavier back and stomach sleepers over 230 pounds, because it's the most supportive. Medium offers a nice balance between pressure relief and support, and the Firm mattress model is a good choice for people who live with back pain because of its medium-firm profile. Combination sleepers who spend an equal amount of time in different sleeping positions, a Beautyrest mattress with a Medium firmness level will be soft and firm enough to accommodate you. Body type Beautyrest mattresses are all designed with individually wrapped coil systems that the brand refers to as T1, T2 and T3 technology. Regardless of the mattress you get, it'll be supportive enough for all body types. Beds that boast T3 individually wrapped coils will just be even more supportive and durable. Beautyrest mattress prices

Prices listed above reflect the cost of the base model. Prices of a Beautyrest range from very fair to relatively expensive. While the brand offers a lot of luxury mattresses, you can also get a premium mattress for a very fair price, compared to other brands. The Harmony and Pressure Smart models are more comparable to bed-in-a-box mattress prices. Trial, warranty and shipping With every Beautyrest black mattress purchase, you can expect:100-night trialFree white glove delivery10-year limited warrantyOnce you purchase a model, you will be contacted by a customer service rep from Beautyrest who will coordinate a delivery date with you. When the delivery people arrive, they'll set up your mattress and conveniently take your old one away for you. Final verdict on the Beautyrest mattressesBeautyrest is up there with the likes of Sealy and Tempur-Pedic and has been in the industry for long enough to know how to make a great quality bed. The Black Collection is their ultra-premium line while the Harmony Collection offers quality beds at more affordable prices. When you buy a Beautyrest mattress you can rest assured that you're making a good investment.You can always return your mattress for a full refund if it isn't up to your standards. If you want a premium mattress from a reputable brand, Beautyrest beds are a good choice and worth the money. How does Beautyrest compare to other mattress brands?Beautyrest vs. Tempur-PedicWhen you compare two of the bedding industry's biggest names, Beautyrest and Tempur-Pedic, you have a lot of high-end mattresses to choose from. The biggest difference between the beds these brands offer is feel. Tempur-Pedic is known for its dense, prominent memory foam-feeling beds. It's the signature feel. Beautyrest mattresses can be purchased with big fluffy pillow tops, and feel more neutral and responsive.Beautyrest vs. Saatva Saatva is a luxury online mattress brand. You won't find one in a brick-and-mortar store like Macy's or Mattress Firm. Like the beds from Beautyrest, the Saatva Classic is a durable and supportive hybrid bed. Saatva has two layers of coils and a Lumbar Support wire for additional back support. Saatva is also more affordable than many of the beds offered by Beautyrest. Beautyrest mattress FAQ
