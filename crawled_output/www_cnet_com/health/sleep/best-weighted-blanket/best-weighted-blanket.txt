What is a weighted blanket?
What are the benefits of a weighted blanket?
If you often feel anxious, regardless of whether it's related to sleep or not, why not try a weighted blanket? They're well-known for their ability to relieve stress and anxiety through deep pressure touch stimulation, which often feels like a warm hug. Better yet, the majority are machine washable, making them as easy to maintain as regular blankets.Weighted blankets come in various materials, typically with quilted squares for even weight distribution. Even outside of aesthetics, there is a lot of variety you can add to your weighted blanket. For example, there are breathable options -- great for hot sleepers -- and cozier blankets that still have the added weight to keep you snug as a bug. There are also weighted blankets with removable duvet covers. However, before you jump into our guide and pick out your favorite, you should know a few crucial things about weighted blankets. For one, not every heavy blanket will do and not every weighted blanket will suit you -- these blankets come in different weights for a good reason. A good rule of thumb is to choose a blanket that's roughly 10% of your body weight. You might not reap the benefits if you decide to go too light. Alternatively, if you go too heavy, you could hurt yourself. Your body may also grow used to a certain weight over time, so you may need to invest in a heavier blanket the longer you use the one you have.Over the years our CNET sleep experts have tested nearly every sleep product you can think of, from mattresses and duvet covers to sleep masks. Now they've tested weighed blankets and are confident they have a list that breaks down everything you need to know about them: from their feel, fill density and quality of each option.What is the best overall weighted blanket?There are a lot of weighted blankets out there, all of which vary by fill, price and feel. If you want some expert help, we found that the Luna weighted blanket is the best overall weighted blanket you can buy.The Luna is a weighted blanket that anyone can like. It's soft and breathable without feeling overwhelming, a common issue with weighted blankets. It's made from 300-thread-count cotton and is filled with micro-glass beads. It's also the most affordable weighted blanket on the list by far -- a welcome trait in a notoriously expensive category, thanks to the high cost of the filling. The Luna weighted blanket is the perfect balance between quality and affordability. Best weighted blankets of 2025

Luna Luxe Weighted Blanket
Best overall weighted blanket
$73 at Amazon
Price: $Care instruction: Spot cleanMaterial: CottonWeight: 10, 15 poundsFilling: Microglass beads, polyester and microfiberReturn policy: 30 daysThe Luna Luxe is not only the best cotton weighted blanket but is our pick for the best overall weighted blanket because it's super soft and heavy without feeling overwhelming. It's designed with a patented layer construction that promotes breathability, and while it's not actively cooling, the design can help regulate your body temperature. This cotton weighted blanket is made of 300-thread-count and filled with polyester, microfiber and microglass beads. One of the most annoying things about some weighted blankets is that the beads inside shift around, clumping as you sleep. Thanks to its microfiber filling and quilted design, the Luna doesn't do that. Many of the best-weighted blankets are on the expensive side, but the Luna strikes a nice balance between quality and budget. Pros:Doesn't shift around when you sleepRegulates body temperatureOeko-Tex 100 certifiedHypoallergenicBudget-friendly optionCons:Not actively cooling

Gravity Cooling Weighted Blanket
Best cooling weighted blanket
$163 at Amazon
Price: $$$Care instructions: Machine-washable cover, insert hand-wash onlyMaterial: Polyester blendWeight: 15, 20, 35 poundsFilling: Glass beadsReturn policy: 30 daysThe key to deep-touch pressure stimulation is that the weighted blanket must cover as much of your body as possible. This can be a problem, especially for hot sleepers who struggle even with normal blankets.During testing, the Gravity weighted blanket emerged as the best cooling weighted blanket. The soft microfiber fleece feels similar to the Luna but with one key difference: the Gravity blanket is made with moisture-wicking fabric designed for hot sleepers who need extra breathability. Pros:CoolingMade with moisture-wicking fabricSoft microfiber feelCons:ExpensiveNot as warm as other optionsInsert not machine washable

Layla Weighted Blanket
Best weighted blanket for couples
$119 at Layla
Price: $$$Care instructions: Machine-washableMaterial: Side one: cotton; Side two: polyester and minkWeight: 15, 20, 25 poundsFilling: High-density microglass beadsReturn policy: 30 daysThe Layla weighted blanket is our choice for the best weighted blanket for couples, thanks to its two-sided design. One side features a soft, plush material that is snuggly and warm for those looking for a fuzzy weighted blanket. The other is a 100% cotton knit. Unlike some weighted blankets, it's available in a king size, which is perfect for sharing. It's also one of the best weighted blankets for people with pets because it's so easy to clean. Fur is easily brushed off without getting stuck in the fabric. The Layla is also snuggly warm, which is ideal if you get chilly easily, but not for warmer climates or hot sleepers. If you want to try the Layla weighted blanket and see if it works for you, there is a 30-night trial and a 100% money-back guarantee. Pros:Two-sided design: fuzzy or soft feelAffordable optionThree weight optionsMachine washableCons:Not for hot sleepers or people who live in hot climatesDoesn't have a weight option for petite peopleOnly one color option

Baloo
Baloo the Mini Weighted Blanket
Best weighted blanket for kids
$156 at Baloo Living
$156 at Amazon
Price: $$Care instructions: Machine-washableMaterial: Cotton Weight: 9 poundsFilling: Glass microbeadsReturn policy: 30 daysChildren shouldn't use just any weighted blanket. Older children should use weighted blankets that are at most 10% of their body weight and younger children should steer clear entirely: Weighted blankets are not safe for children under 4. Kids' weighted blankets are designed specifically for the weight and size that kids can handle. The Mini from Baloo is the best weighted blanket for kids with its soft, quilt-like design. It's made from natural cotton for breathability and has a glass microbead filling. The Baloo is only available at 9 pounds, making it a good choice for kids over 90 pounds. This blanket is machine-washable, but it dries quickly in the dryer, so if you leave it in too long, you may damage it. Pros:Machine washableSoft cotton coverCons:Not for kids under 4

Mosaic Weighted Blanket
Best customizable weighted blanket
$172 at Mosaic
Price: $$Care instructions: Machine-washableMaterial: CottonWeight: 5, 8 and 10 poundsFilling: BPA-free, hypoallergenic, FDA-compliant plastic pelletsReturn policy: 14 daysMosaic weighted blankets, made by a family-owned and -operated company, are the best customizable weighted blankets you can get. They come in three weights, multiple fabrics and various patterns. If you'd value the chance to create your ultimate weighted-blanket experience, then you'll like the Mosaic.If you don't want to spend time on customization, there are better options. We found that the Mosaic's weighted beads shift when you move, which can result in the weight pooling in one area. Pros:CustomizableMultiple weight optionsMachine washableCons:Not the best choice if you don't care about customizationBeads shift around in the blanket

SensaCalm Weighted Blanket
Best luxury weighted blanket
$239 at SensaCalm
Price: $$$Care instructions: Machine-washableMaterial: CottonWeight: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 poundsFilling: Hypoallergenic, nontoxic glass beads and poly-filReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: One yearYou want your weighted blanket to feel good, but it should look good too. The SensaCalm weighted blanket is the best-looking weighted blanket. It has a quilted pocket design and an almost crushed velvet look and feel. The other weighted blankets we tested look great, but SensaCalm is a step above. This looks like it could be displayed on your bed or couch all year.The all-weather version of this weighted blanket features two sides: warm fleece and cool cotton, making it a great year-round option. It's one of the warmest weighted blankets for cool weather. Unfortunately, this is one of the most expensive weighted blankets on the list. The high-quality materials and luxury look will cost you around $239. Pros:Machine washableSoft, velvet feelFour weight optionsTwo-sided designCons:Expensive

How we tested the best weighted blanketsOur sleep experts carefully curated this list based on first-hand testing. We tested the weighted blankets exactly as you would expect: we snuggled with them, noting how they helped us sleep and relax. Each weighted blanket was evaluated on its performance, cost and materials. The fill, weight and cleaning instructions were also considered.  What to consider when shopping for a weighted blanket If you're looking to improve your sleep or ease anxiety, weighted blankets can help. So how do you choose the right one? There are a lot of weighted blankets on the market, so sorting through the brands can be tough. Keep these things in mind when shopping:Fill and materialThe magic of weighted blankets comes from the fill. Common fill materials include glass beads, plastic pellets and polyester microfill. This comes down to preference. Plastic beads are larger, making the blanket a little bulkier, while glass beads usually bump up the price. Also, consider what material you want on the outside of the blanket. For instance, cotton can feel cooler than polyester.WeightIf you don't choose carefully, weighted blankets can feel too heavy. Getting a weight appropriate for your needs and body type is important. Your weighted blanket should be about 10% of your body weight for optimal comfort. That means if you weigh from 160 to 190 pounds, you want a 15- or 20-pound weighted blanket. Typically, 35 pounds is too heavy for most people. PriceThere's a wide price range for the best weighted blankets. They can be as affordable as $35 or as expensive as $250 or more. Many cheaper options are just as soft as the expensive ones, while some at higher prices have special cooling technology. No matter your preferences, there is a weighted blanket at every price point.What is a weighted blanket?Weighted blankets use deep-touch pressure stimulation to calm the nervous system. When we experience stress or anxiety, our nervous system kicks into high gear. Our hearts start to race, our muscles contract and our bodies are flooded with cortisol and adrenaline.  Studies have shown that deep-pressure stimulation can reduce cortisol levels in the body while increasing serotonin and dopamine levels. Then the body relaxes, and our parasympathetic nervous system takes over. Weighted blankets are essentially big hugs that promote relaxation and reduce anxiety.  What are the benefits of a weighted blanket? Weighted blankets can help us sleep better at night, but that's not the only upside. Benefits of weighted blankets include: Creating a sense of calm by reducing cortisol levels in the bodyReducing symptoms of anxietyIncreasing serotonin and oxytocin levelsImproving your quality of sleep
Best weighted blanket FAQs
Is it safe for kids to use weighted blankets?
You should never use a weighted blanket on infants and small children (age 4 and under) as it increases suffocation risks. Weighted blankets are not safe at this age. Weighted blankets designed for older children are smaller in weight and size compared with the blankets for adults. Weighted blankets should only be 10% of a person's total weight. This means most adult weighted blankets aren't suitable for older children; they will be too heavy. Choose one specifically designed for children to ensure that it's correctly proportioned. Here are the key things to consider when letting older children use weighted blankets:Only purchase weighted blankets that are designed for children. The blanket should only be about 10% of your child's weight. Do not round up. Start with supervised use to ensure your child can move around and lift the blanket without assistance. Remember, weighted blankets are tested for adults. Speak to your child's doctor to see whether a weighted blanket is appropriate for them. There may be other things you can do to help your child sleep.
Do weighted blankets really work?
Weighted blankets aren't a magic cure-all for anxiety and interrupted sleep, but they can help both things. They use deep-pressure stimulation to calm the nervous system and promote relaxation, similar to how swaddling blankets do for babies.More research is needed to fully investigate how weighted blankets work. Various studies show they do help trigger the parasympathetic nervous system, which relaxes the body.
How do I wash a weighted blanket?
Care instructions vary for weighted blankets. Some of them are easier to wash than others. A lot of the best weighted blankets are machine-washable in some way. Some have a removable cover, while others are fully machine-washable on cold without a dryer cycle. Others are spot-clean only. Always read the label on your blanket for specific care instructions.Read more: How to Wash a Weighted Blanket in 3 Easy Steps
How heavy should a weighted blanket be?
Weighted blankets are available in different sizes and weights, but you should be strategic in your choice. The general rule: Choose a weight close to 10% of your body weight. Choose less if that's your preference, but refrain from choosing more. For reference, if you weigh 150 pounds, you're suited for a 15-pound weighted blanket or less. If you weigh 200 pounds, opt for a 20-pound blanket or less.
Do the best weighted blankets make you hot?
Weighted blankets can feel hot for some sleepers. Blanket manufacturers combat this by using certain knit materials or special cooling technology. If you're a particularly hot sleeper, stick to a blanket that focuses on cooling such as the Gravity Cooling weighted blanket.
