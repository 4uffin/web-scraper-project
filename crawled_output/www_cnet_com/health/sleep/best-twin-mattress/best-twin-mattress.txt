Not everyone needs a queen or a king-size mattress. They can take up quite a lot of space, and some of the best options out there aren't exactly budget-friendly. Twin mattresses are a more compact, cost-effective alternative and far more versatile than people give them credit for. They can be a great option for a kid’s room or smaller spaces. And yes, adults can absolutely sleep on them comfortably despite the relatively small size. After hands-on experience with top brands like Leesa, Nectar, Nolah, Bear and Brooklyn Bedding, we’ve narrowed down the best mattresses out there. Here are CNET's top picks. Our Picks

What's the best twin mattress overall?The Leesa Studio takes the crown as the best overall twin-size mattress thanks to its affordability, comfortability, accommodating feel and medium firmness profile. "An often overlooked pick from Leesa that gets outshined by the incredibly popular Leesa Original, the Leesa Studio is an affordable memory foam mattress option that isn't quite as dense-feeling as some of its competition like the Bear Original and the Nectar Classic," said CNET senior video producer Owen Poole. "Its slightly firmer than medium profile should also make it accommodating for all sleeping positions. The Leesa Studio is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a budget-friendly foam bed."Leesa Studio

SCORE
Pros
Only $549, though discounts drop it even lower
Made with premium foams
Accommodating firmness and feel makes it good for anyone
Cons
Not suited for strict side sleepers
Edge support is not great which isn't great for people who sleep on the edge of the bed
The Leesa Studio is a comfortable and accommodating mattress at an affordable price. Its design is simple, but simple doesn't mean you have to sacrifice quality. Leesa uses premium, high-quality materials in all its beds, and the brand frequents our CNET best lists.Why we like this bed: The Leesa Studio has a responsive memory foam feel. It has some of that sinking and contouring sensation associated with memory foam but not as much as denser beds like the Tempur-Pedic. Switching positions throughout the night is a little easier because it's slightly bouncier and more responsive than traditional memory foam. This mattress lands between medium and medium-firm on the firmness scale, ranked 6.4 out of 10 by our Mattress Smasher 9000.The Leesa Studio stands 10 inches tall and is comprised of three foam layers: a support base layer, a transition layer with a neutral feel and that responsive memory foam comfort layer, all topped with a soft knit cover. If you're searching for a twin-size mattress, you probably won't need to worry about motion isolation since you likely won't be sharing the bed. Regardless, the Leesa Studio mattress excels in this category thanks to its all-foam construction.Who should get this bed: Overall, it has an accommodating feel and firmness that most sleepers should find enjoyable. Since it's a tad over the medium threshold and into medium-firm, it's more oriented for back and stomach sleepers, but it will still be comfortable for combination sleepers who spend some time on their side.Who shouldn't: Because of its firmness, I wouldn't recommend this bed to petite side sleepers, who might find this bed too firm. Additionally, the Studio does not offer cooling features -- if you're looking for that, check out the Leesa Studio Chill instead.Runner-up: Brooklyn Bedding's DreamFoam Essential comes in a variety of height options and lands around the same medium-firm firmness level as the Leesa Studio Chill; however, it has more of that dense memory foam feel, and for less than $300 for a twin, it's quite a bit cheaper.  ...

Best twin memory foam mattress
Nectar Premier Memory Foam
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great for those wanting a lighter memory foam feel
Excellent motion isolation which is good for couples
Accommodates most sleeping positions
This bed is backed by a forever warranty and 365 night trial
Cons
$2,244 for a twin is expensive before discounts
Too firm for strict side sleepers
Hybrid version offers more support
The Nectar Premier Memory Foam mattress is an accommodating memory foam mattress with an airy and light body-conforming feel. It's slightly more responsive than traditional dense and viscous memory foam, making it easier to switch positions.Why we like this bed: Our experts found the Nectar Premier Memory Foam between medium and medium-firm on the firmness scale, so it's comfortable for most sleeping positions, including back, stomach and combination. "The middle tier mattress in Nectar's new lineup is in the Goldilocks zone, being "just right" for most sleepers when it comes to firmness, with an accommodating medium profile that pairs well with its body-conforming memory foam feel. For people who don't want a firm mattress, the extra cost of the Nectar Premier is well worth it." - Owen Poole, CNET senior video producerThis bed is 13 inches thick and features a dense support foam layer on the bottom, followed by a responsive transition foam with zoned support and a 2-inch comfort layer on top. The cover is breathable, and though not actively cooling, it will help you stay temperature-neutral throughout the night. It offers decent edge support, so you shouldn't feel you'll roll off if you sleep near the edge -- which is more likely to occur on a twin-size mattress.Who should get this bed: If you're someone who loves the feel of dense memory foam, then you'll like the Nectar Premier all-foam bed. It's best suited for back, stomach and combination sleepers because of its firmness profile.Who shouldn't: This bed may be a tad too firm if you're a strict side sleeper. If you're heavier, you may want to consider the Nectar Premier Hybrid, which has an 8-inch layer of individually wrapped support coils. The hybrid model has a slightly softer feel than the all-foam version, around a true medium, making it great for all sleeper types.Runner-up: The DreamCloud Premier Memory Foam is around the same price and offers a responsive memory foam feel with a medium to medium-firm profile.  ...

Best firm twin mattress
Brooklyn Bedding CopperFlex
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Comes in hybrid and all-foam options
Affordable price point at $465 before sales
Has plenty of support for back and stomach sleepers
Zoned support can help with back pain
Supportive for heavier individuals and couples
Cons
Too firm for side sleeping
Might be too firm for lighter people who put less pressure on the bed
Brooklyn Bedding's recently released CopperFlex mattress comes in all-foam and hybrid versions. Why we like this bed: The CopperFlex has a firm, dense foam feel with a slight hint of pillow top. It's so supportive that, as a lighter individual, I feel like I'm lying on top of the mattress rather than sinking into the foam layers. Heavier individuals will likely feel more of the dense memory foam's sinking and body-contouring sensation. This bed features zoned support that is noticeable when you lie down. This is because of its 1.5-inch layer of Zoned Lumbar Support, designed to keep your spine neutrally aligned and help relieve back pain. This bed is great at isolating motion, thanks to the memory foam layers that help to deaden movement. The edge support is fine -- you may feel some slight rolling-off sensation if you're lying directly on the edges of the all-foam model. Who should get this bed: We found both models to be medium-firm to firm, confirmed by our Mattress Smasher 9000, which ranked the all-foam CopperFlex 7.9 and the CopperFlex hybrid 7.8 out of 10 on the firmness scale. This means they're best suited for back and stomach sleepers looking for a supportive mattress.Who shouldn't: This bed is way too firm for side sleepers. Additionally, the base CopperFlex model has no active cooling technology, so it sleeps more temperature-neutral. If you're a hot sleeper looking for a bed that will keep you cool, check out the CopperFlex Pro. This model is essentially the same as the base but features a GlacioTex cooling cover with copper-infused memory foam to help regulate heat. Many brands don't live up to the claims of their beds being cooling, but this one does -- the cover on the CopperFlex Pro is definitely cool to the touch, similar to the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe. Runner-up: We'd say CopperFlex's all-foam model feels and performs similarly to the all-foam version of Plank Firm. CopperFlex's hybrid model is most similar to Big Fig, a supportive mattress designed specifically for sleepers with bigger bodies (although Big Fig is a tad softer).    ... Show more

Best value twin mattress
Allswell
7.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Super affordable at only $194
Supportive hybrid bed
Good edge support
Best suited for back and stomach sleepers
Cons
Not enough pressure relief for strict side sleepers
No all-foam option
"You don't have to spend a ton to get a good bed. The Allswell mattress is the perfect example of that. It's a surprisingly comfy (though on the firmer side) hybrid bed that's widely accommodating and ultra-affordable. Perfect for guest rooms or college dorms, the Allswell mattress is my top recommendation for people on a budget." - Taylor Leamey, CNET senior sleep writer.Why we like this bed: A twin-size Allswell retails at Walmart for $194, but it's often less during the brand's frequent sales. It's an incredible price point for a bed of this quality, especially one with coils for enhanced durability. This affordable bed has surprisingly good edge support because of its reinforced perimeter. You shouldn't feel like you're rolling off while sleeping near the edge of this bed. Despite claiming to have cooling features with its gel-infused memory foam layer, this mattress sleeps temperature-neutral and is topped with a soft knit cover that's not necessarily cool-to-the-touch. It's pretty bouncy and responsive, making it easy to switch positions if you're a combination sleeper."Allswell is one of the best value mattresses out there. It's the most affordable hybrid mattress I have ever tested, but you wouldn't know by looking or feeling it. With its medium to medium firm profile, I think it will suit most sleepers.” - Caroline Igo, CNET sleep editor.Who should get this bed: The Allswell Hybrid mattress has a neutral feel and is between medium and medium-firm on the firmness scale, making it suitable for all sleeper types -- particularly back, stomach and combination sleepers. Our Mattress Smasher 9000 confirmed this firmness by rating Allswell 6.3 out of 10. Who shouldn't: Strict side sleepers may feel that it's a tad too firm. If you're looking for a slightly softer version of this bed, check out the Allswell Luxe. Runner-up: Few beds in the mattress industry compare to Allswell's price and quality. A close contender would be the Dreamfoam Hybrid, which has a similar feel but a softer firmness profile, around medium, and costs a couple of hundred dollars more than Allswell.  ... Show more

Best twin mattress for side sleepers
Nolah Original
7.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great for side sleepers because it has plenty of pressure relief
Unique blended foam feel
Nolah offers frequent discounts that drop the price of this $99 bed
Lifetime warranty
Cons
Retails on the expensive side at $999 for a twin
Too soft for strict back sleepers
The Nolah Original is a 10-inch all-foam mattress with a blended foam feel and firmness profile between medium to medium-soft. It offers plenty of pressure relief for your hips and shoulders while lying on your side. It's not too firm or soft, offering a nice balance between cushioning and support for light to average-weight sleepers.Why we like this bed: "The latest iteration of this unique mattress is not quite as soft as previous models but should still work effectively for side sleepers. The foam gives the bed a blend of traditional memory foam and a more responsive neutral foam. It even has some zoned support foam, which might help with back pain, all at an affordable price." - Owen Poole, CNET senior video producerThe top layer is Nolah's proprietary AirFoam, which has the unique feel Owen referenced. When lying on it, you'll sink in as the foam conforms around your body; however, it's more airy than traditional dense memory foam. It almost feels like it pushes back against you slightly. It's responsive and snaps back into shape quicker than dense memory foam. The AirFoam and transition layer underneath combine to create an accommodating mixed foam feel. The edge support is fine -- there's no additional reinforcement around the borders of this mattress, so you may feel some slight sagging when lying on the edge.Who should get this bed: Our team found the Nolah Original 10-inch between medium and medium-soft, offering ample pressure relief for side sleepers. Who shouldn't: Because of this softer profile, this mattress may be too soft for heavy individuals or those who primarily sleep on their back or stomach. Though the Nolah Original has copper-infused foam and a Tencel cover, it doesn't actively cool you throughout the night but should keep you feeling temperature-neutral.Runner-up: The Tuft & Needle Original Mattress is a similar all-foam bed with a neutral foam feel and a medium firmness profile, making it comfortable and accommodating for all sleeping positions.  ...

Best XL twin mattress
Layla Hybrid
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Dual-sided with two firmness options
Hybrid construction supports all body types
Accommodates all sleeping positions
XL is better for taller individuals who need more legroom
Cons
XL twins are more expensive than twin
Not for those who don't like memory foam
The Layla Hybrid is a unique, flippable mattress with a more airy, responsive memory foam feel than traditional dense memory foam. It gives some body-contouring sensation without making you feel "stuck" like denser foams might. It's like having two beds in one -- since it's dual-sided, you can flip the mattress for different firmness levels.Why we like this bed: We found the softer side of Layla Hybrid around medium-soft (3.1 out of 10, according to the Mattress Smasher), while the firmer side is between medium and medium-firm (ranked 5.3 by the Mattress Smasher). In the middle of this mattress is a 6-inch layer of individually wrapped coils, and on either side are varying levels and types of foam to give each side different firmness profiles. Both sides include a layer of antimicrobial copper-infused gel memory foam intended to keep you cooler; however, the mattress still sleeps more temperature-neutral than actively cooling."When it comes to flippable beds, this is one of my favorite choices. The Layla Hybrid is definitely worth your consideration if you're in the market for a double-sided mattress with an airy memory foam feel that's backed by great policies. Also, if you don't mind spending up for something a bit more premium, I think you'll get a lot out of this bed in the long run -- especially if you dig memory foam and you're on the heavier side." - JD Christison, CNET senior video producerWho should get this bed: The soft side of Layla is ideal for side sleepers looking for more cushioning pressure relief around their shoulders and hips. The flip side, at a medium, will be better for combination sleepers looking for a more supportive surface. Two XL twin beds pushed together form a king-size bed -- another reason we chose the Layla Hybrid as the best XL twin mattress. Its dual-sided design is perfect for couples looking to push two XL twin beds together for a king-size setup while still enjoying their preferred side of the Layla Hybrid.Who shouldn't: One downside is that strict back and stomach sleepers may find both sides of the Layla Hybrid slightly too soft.  ...

Best hybrid twin mattress
Helix Midnight Core

SCORE
Pros
Accommodating firmness and feel for all sleeper types
Strong coil system for enhanced durability and support
Cons
Leans a little on the expensive side at $999 for a twin
No all-foam version
The Helix Midnight offers an accommodating medium firmness level and a soft, neutral foam feel that most sleepers will like. Thanks to its innerspring system of individually wrapped coils, this bed offers plenty of support and durability for heavier individuals, which is why we chose it as the best hybrid twin-size mattress.Why we like this bed: Its medium firmness profile makes it a great middle ground for all sleeping positions, including side, stomach, back and combination. The Helix Midnight's neutral feel has a slight hint of memory foam due to the top comfort layer of a unique Helix blend of "Memory Plus Foam." Beneath that are two layers of a more responsive foam intended to provide ergonomic support.This bed has extra coils along the edges for reinforcement, so you should feel supported while sleeping on the edge. It's topped with a soft knit cover that's light and breathable. There's no active cooling technology in the Core model of the Helix Midnight, and we think it sleeps more temperature-neutral. If sleeping hot is an issue for you, you can add the optional GlacioTex Cooling Pillow Top for an additional fee.Who should get this bed: I'd recommend the Helix Midnight mattress to anyone can sleep on. Though it's best suited for sleepers who aren't looking for a super firm bed.Who shouldn't: If you're a particularly hot or heavy sleeper, other significant upgrades are available (for a price) through Helix's Luxe and Elite collection. Overall, Helix Sleep offers six mattresses in three tiers of collections: Core, Luxe and Elite. If you need help deciding which Helix bed is right for you, the brand's Sleep Quiz can help you narrow down your options.Runner-up: The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid is another premium, more affordable hybrid mattress with a soft, neutral foam feel. It comes in three firmness options, with the medium model being the most similar to the Helix Midnight Core.  ... Show more

The Bear Cub is an 8.5-inch-thick twin mattress designed for young children. It has an accommodating, neutral feel that most kids will like. Most importantly, it's GreenGuard Gold Certified and made without any harsh chemicals or fiberglass. It also features a quilted hypoallergenic cover with cooling fibers for a soft, breathable sleeping surface. Rest assured, your child will have a healthier sleep on the clean and comfy Bear Cub bed.Why we like this bed: This bed sits right around a medium on the firmness scale, and our Mattress Smasher ranked it 4.3 out of 10. The bottom layer includes hundreds of 6" coils, enhancing the bed's durability as your child ages. On top of that is a sturdy yet responsive foam layer intended to support the child's growing body. Above that is the primary comfort layer of gel memory foam. The reinforced edge support should help lessen the chance of your child rolling off the mattress.The customer reviews are highly rated on Bear's website, with one verified buyer of the Bear Cub mattress saying, "As a chiropractor, I care very much about the quality of the mattress and the toxins that might be lurking in it. This mattress is very clean and totally odor-free. It is actually very comfortable for my husband and I to lay on with our little one when we need to. I highly recommend this mattress."Who should get this bed: This bed is a great choice for just about any kid. Bear offers great company policies such as a lifetime warranty, a 120-night trial period, free shipping and returns. Retailing for $695 for a twin-size, it teeters into the more expensive side, but Bear offers heavy discounts throughout the year, especially around holidays, that can bring the price down as low as $487.Who shouldn't: If you're on a tight budget, $695 might be a little more than you want to spend.Runner-up: The Saatva Youth Mattress is more expensive but offers a dual-sided design so you can flip the bed to adapt to your growing child's firmness level needs from ages 3 to 12 (plush side for ages 3 to 7 and a medium-firm side for ages 8 to 12).  ...

Best twin mattress firmness data
In addition to subjectively analyzing firmness using our expertise and experience, we test it objectively with our Mattress Smasher 9000. Below are the firmness levels determined by the Smasher for the best twin-size mattresses on this list. The soft side of Layla Hybrid was the softest, coming in at 3.1 out of 10, and the firmest was the Brooklyn Bedding CopperFlex, at 7.9 out of 10.
Read more: What We’ve Learned About Mattress Firmness Using Our Mattress Smasher 9000 How we test the best twin mattresses
Our sleep experts primarily test queen-size mattresses because our warehouse and bedroom studios accommodate queen beds (and most of our testers have queen-size bed frames at home). It's also the most commonly purchased mattress size by far.The good news is that a queen-size mattress will feel and perform like a twin-size. When selecting the best twin-size mattresses, we performed our standardized mattress testing processes, paying close attention to price, value and accommodatingness. Firmness
The Mattress Smasher 9000 getting ready to smash a bed and provide us with an objective firmness score. Aly Lopez/CNETWe use our expertise and unbiased technology to determine a bed's firmness level. We always test it subjectively first by having our experts of varying weights and body types lie or sleep on it, using our extensive experience comparing hundreds of beds over the years. We then test each mattress objectively using our propriety Masher Smasher 9000 apparatus. We do our best to determine and describe a bed's firmness, but at the end of the day, firmness is still a subjective characteristic that will differ from person to person.FeelFeel is another subjective characteristic we test and review, and it is directly impacted by the bed's construction and materials. We do our best to describe how it feels to lie on the bed -- do you slowly sink into dense memory foam as it conforms around your body? Is there a soft and cushioning pillow top that makes it feel like you're lying on a cloud? Is it bouncy and responsive?Motion isolation
Owen tests the edge support on the Nolah Original mattress. Jon Gomez/CNETMotion isolation refers to how the bed's materials deaden movement through and across the top of the mattress. We analyze this by setting a glass of water on the bed while one tester rolls around and switches positions so we can observe how much the water sloshes around. We also test it by having a sleep expert lie on the bed while another flops and rolls around on the other side. A bed with sound motion isolation will prevent most of that motion from transferring. It's an important characteristic to look for if you share the bed with a partner, but not so much if you sleep alone on a twin-size mattress.Edge supportThe stability of a bed's perimeter is a key element to consider if you tend to sleep on the edge of the mattress. We view the mattress's edge support as weak if the edge caves or smushes down considerably when we sit or lay on it. Mattresses with reinforced edge support typically have additional foam or coils around at least two of the four edges of the bed to provide a more stable sleeping surface.Construction
We remove the mattress cover to analyze its construction and materials. Dillon Payne/CNETA large component of assessing and testing beds is analyzing what they're made of. We use the bed's construction to inform how durable and supportive it will be, often removing the mattress cover and cutting open the fire sock to see and physically test and feel each mattress layer inside. We also analyze the construction to determine how cool or hot the bed will sleep -- is there active cooling technology, such as a cooling cover or copper-infused gel memory foam? In addition to physically testing the construction, knowing how these materials function and interact with your body helps us make better-informed deductions about the bed's performance. What to consider when buying a twin mattress
If you're looking to buy a twin-size mattress, you are likely on a tight budget, or it's intended for a small bedroom, guest room, dorm room or kid's room. Here are some considerations to keep in mind while shopping.Co-sleepingTwin mattresses are the smallest bed size. If you co-sleep or share the bed with a partner or pets, we recommend opting for at least a full-size mattress instead. Full mattresses are a little pricier, but not by much -- for example, a twin-size Leesa Studio mattress retails for $549, and a full-size retails for $699. It could be worth the upgrade if you plan to share the bed.ConstructionYou don't have to sacrifice comfort or quality when buying an affordable twin mattress. Keep in mind that hybrid beds with coils will be more durable and likely last longer since coils won't degrade as foam does over time. We recommend looking for a twin mattress at least ten inches thick, especially if you are an average or heavy-weight person. Lighter individuals and children can get by on a thinner mattress.FirmnessIf you're looking to buy a twin mattress for yourself, consider your sleeping position. Side sleepers will be more comfortable on softer beds with plenty of pressure relief, while back and stomach sleepers typically prefer firmer mattresses for spinal support.Kids tend to like a softer, plusher feel, but the bed shouldn't be too soft -- their growing bodies need adequate support for their spines as they develop. Generally, a mattress that's at least medium-firm is the recommended firmness level for children.If you're searching for a twin-size mattress for your guest bedroom, consider a model with a medium firmness level. This accommodates anyone who decides to stay, from your side-sleeping Aunt Karen to your back-sleeping and snoring Grandpa Joe.PriceBudget will play a significant role in the mattress you purchase. The average twin-size mattress price tag can range from $600 to $1,200, but plenty of great options are below that price point. Determining your budget first will help narrow down the best picks for you, and you don't necessarily have to compromise comfort or quality when purchasing a cheaper bed.  What we're testing next

Best Twin Mattress FAQs
How much should a good twin mattress cost?
A basic yet good-quality twin mattress starts at around $500. For budget options, you can find a twin mattress for $200 or less, while premium twin mattresses can run for $700 or more.
What are the dimensions of a twin-size mattress?
Twin-size mattresses are 38 inches wide by 75 inches long. Since they’re slim, they can easily fit in smaller spaces and bedrooms, such as college dorm rooms, children’s bedrooms and guest rooms. If you’re over 6 feet tall, we recommend opting for an XL twin mattress, which provides 5 more inches of length so your feet are less likely to dangle over the edge.Learn more about mattress sizes.
Do two twin mattresses make a king?
Not quite. A regular twin-size mattress measures 38 inches wide by 75 inches long. An XL twin is 5 inches longer, at 38 inches wide by 80 inches long. A king-size mattress is 76 inches wide by 80 inches long. This means that two XL twin beds pushed together form a king-size mattress -- not two standard twin mattresses. Learn more about the difference between twin and XL twin.
What is the best thickness for a twin-size mattress?
The average twin bed is 8 to 12 inches thick. For a nice balance of comfort and support, we recommend opting for a bed that's at least 10 inches thick. Your weight and body type also play into this -- a thicker bed will provide more support if you're on the heavier side or over 230 pounds. In that case, we recommend opting for a twin-size bed that's between 12 to 14 inches thick.
How often should you replace your mattress?
The lifespan of a mattress can vary, but generally, it's a good idea to consider replacement every seven to 10 years. If you start noticing sagging, loss of support or discomfort, it's a clear sign that it's time for an upgrade.
Is a twin the same as a single?
Yes, a twin and single are interchangeable sizes with a width of 38 inches and a length of 75 inches.
How often should you rotate a twin mattress?
Like most mattresses, it's recommended that you rotate a twin mattress every 3-6 months to ensure even wear and tear. This also helps extend the lifespan of the mattress.
