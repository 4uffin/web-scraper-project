How I tested the best cooling comforters
What to consider when choosing a cooling comforter
Your body temperature significantly impacts your sleep quality. Cooling bedding such as pillows, sheets, comforters and mattresses can help if you toss and turn at night because it's too hot. Unlike traditional bedding that can trap heat and moisture, cooling comforters are lightweight and breathable, helping to beat that summer heat. As a certified sleep coach, I've tested mattresses, bedding and sleep products for years. After personally testing a dozen cooling comforters, here are the best options for hot sleepers, along with a couple of honorable mentions.What is the best overall cooling comforter?The Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter is my top pick for the best overall cooling comforter because of its truly cool-to-the-touch feel, comfort, color options, weight and moisture-wicking properties. During my testing, I found that it kept me dry throughout the night -- an extremely important characteristic for a hot sleeper like myself.
Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter in ivory has a cool-to-the-touch feel. Caroline Igo/CNETWhat We Updated: April 2025We added another selection to this best list and updated the product details in the comparison chart.Best cooling comforters of 2025
Editors' choice
Caroline Igo/CNET
Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter
Best overall cooling comforter
$229 at Rest Duvet
Why we chose this comforter: The Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter is silky soft and truly cool to the touch. It's machine-washable, has a wavy stitch pattern and comes in six colors: arctic white, snow ivory, cool gray, aqua blue, navy and lavender. Three of those colors are reversible, so you can easily switch up the look of your bedding. It's made with Tencel Lyocell and poly fibers, and the cover is nylon and spandex. Plus, Rest Duvet often has sales, so you can often find this comforter for less than $180 after discounts for a queen size.Who should get it: The Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter is great for wicking away moisture, which is ideal if you sweat at night. It kept me dry, and when I turned to my side in the middle of the night, the other side of the comforter was still cool to the touch. If you prefer bedding with a little more fluff or don't want to use this as your sole comforter, I recommend using the Rest Evercool as a top sheet or a blanket. Either way, sleeping with it will keep you from waking up covered in sweat.Who shouldn't: If you don't sleep hot, this comforter will likely be too cold for you.Pros:Soft and very cool to the touchComes in six colors (three are reversible)Effectively wicks away moistureCons:Thinner and wrinkles easilyDoesn't have anchor loops if you want to use it as a duvet insertThreading wears over time
$229 at Rest Duvet
Caroline Igo/CNET
Slumber Cloud UltraCool Comforter
Softest cooling comforter
$335 at Slumber Cloud
Why we chose this comforter: I love how soft and fluffy the UltraCool Comforter by Slumber Cloud is; true to its name, it feels like a cloud. You can choose between lightweight (for the hottest sleepers) or all-season fill options and three different colors: white, navy and sand.Who should get it: If you loved everything about the Rest Evercool Cooling Comforter but wished it was fluffier and had anchor loops, then the Slumber Cloud UltraCool Comforter is for you. The truly cool-to-the-touch cover is made with nylon and spandex, and the filling is 100% polyester fiber. It's machine-washable, hypoallergenic and can be used as a comforter or a duvet insert.Who shouldn't: I noticed it might not be thin or lightweight enough for some hot sleepers. If that's you, I recommend the thinner Rest Evercool instead.Pros:Soft and truly cool to the touchFluffy; feels like a cloudTemperature regulatingCons:Only three color optionsMay not be light enough for some hot sleepers
$335 at Slumber Cloud
Caroline Igo/CNET
Silk and Snow Down Alternative Comforter
Best affordable cooling comforter
$110 at Silk and Snow
Why we chose this comforter: If you're looking for a cooling comforter with the best value, the Silk and Snow Down Alternative Comforter is easily the best option. This comforter is machine-washable and hypoallergenic. It's crafted with down-like microfiber fill and a square baffle construction to keep the fill in place. Plus, the corners have anchor loops if you want to use it as a duvet insert.Who should get it: This is a high-quality comforter for those shopping on a budget. The lightweight version in queen-size retails for $110, which we'd consider an excellent value -- and that's before factoring in the brand's frequent discounts. While I wouldn't say the outer shell is soft or cool to the touch, the comforter is lightweight. Made of 100% cotton, there are also all-season and winter thickness options, but hot sleepers should stick to the lightweight version.Who shouldn't: If you want a comforter that feels truly cool to the touch, this isn't the one for you.Pros:Can be a duvet insert or a comforterHas anchor loops to hold it in placeBest value for your moneyCons:Not soft or cool to the touchSome of the fill may escape
$110 at Silk and Snow
Caroline Igo/CNET
Brooklinen Down Comforter
Best lightweight cooling comforter
$299 at Brooklinen
Why we chose this comforter: Hot sleepers should look for comforters with the right cooling materials and weight. Truly lightweight comforters are hard to come by, but the Brooklinen Down Comforter is just right.Who should get it: If you want a fluffy comforter with ethically sourced down and feathers, try Brooklinen. The outer shell is made with 100% long-staple cotton and has a baffle box construction (meaning the filling won't get stuck in one place). The down cluster and feather fill are sustainably sourced from Hutterite Farms in Canada and are Downmark Certified.I like how fluffy this comforter is, and I can see it as a duvet insert or a comforter on its own. Just like any down comforter, be aware that some fill may escape. Also, be sure to dry-clean or spot-clean only.Who shouldn't: If you want a silky smooth or super cool to the touch comforter, this isn't the one for you. It's also not for you if you want to be able to throw your comforter in the washing machine.Pros:Fluffy, light and Downmark Certified650 fill power (lowest amount of heat retention)Has anchor loops for secure attachmentCons:Only available in whiteSome of the fill may escape
$299 at Brooklinen
Caroline Igo/CNET
Sijo AiryWeight Eucalyptus Comforter
Best temperature-regulating cooling comforter
$235 at Sijo Home
$235 at Amazon
$235 at Amazon
Why we chose this comforter: Sijo specializes in sustainable sleep products. Most of its bedding is made from eucalyptus fibers, which is one of the most sustainable fabrics. The cover and the filling are 100% Tencel lyocell, which is naturally cool and moisture-wicking. The Sijo AiryWeight Eucalyptus Comforter is cool to the touch, lightweight and has eight loops for securing it into place with a duvet cover.Who should get it: In addition to being the best temperature-regulating cooling comforter on this list, it's also the best for those with allergies. Eucalyptus is naturally hypoallergenic and the comforter is certified Asthma and Allergy Friendly. While I didn't find this comforter as soft as others on this list, its high-quality materials are hard to beat. It's gently weighted, so it provides a little more of that cozy feel.Who shouldn't: This comforter is not as soft as others on this list, so if that's your main priority, you'll want to look elsewhere.Pros:Thin and cool to the touchCan be a comforter on its ownOeko-Tex 100 and Asthma and Allergy Friendly certifiedHas anchor loopsCons:Not overly softOnly available in white
$235 at Sijo Home

Cozy Earth Bamboo Comforter
Best bamboo cooling comforter
$608 at Cozy Earth
Why we chose this comforter: Cozy Earth products feel and look luxurious, and its Bamboo Comforter is no exception. It has detailed stitching along the edge, a baffle box construction and feels cool to the touch. Plus, it looks great as a standalone comforter. The cover and the filling are 100% Viscose from bamboo, which is naturally breathable and moisture-wicking, keeping you cool.Who should get it: I see this comforter as all-season, so if you don't want to switch out your comforter as the seasons change, this is a good choice. I tested the standard fill, which I found cool and light enough for hot sleepers but can also help keep you warm during colder months. While this is one of the most expensive on the list, Cozy Earth does have frequent sales -- right now, the queen size is 25% off, bringing the price down to $319. The bamboo texture is smooth and a bit more durable than other delicate materials like silk.Who shouldn't: If you're on a tight budget, there are other more wallet-friendly options on this list.Pros:Made with 100% Viscose from bambooNaturally breathable and moisture-wickingHas anchor loopsCan be used as an all-season comforterCons:Expensive, retailing at $425 for a queenNot the softest
$608 at Cozy Earth
Caroline Igo/CNET
Birch Natural Down Duvet Insert
Best down cooling comforter
$399 at Birch
Why we chose this comforter: Birch is one of the best organic and natural bedding brands out there. Its Natural Down Duvet Insert is a mix of 70% white down and 30% wool fill, which both meet the Responsible Down Standard. The cover is made of organic cotton fibers that help wick moisture and keep you cool, and it meets the standards for being Fair Trade certified.Who should get it: If you're conscientious about your bedding and where the material comes from, look no further than Birch. While this comforter is meant for all seasons, I found it to be heavier than the other comforters on this list. However, it's very fluffy and will still be suitable for some hot sleepers. It's also machine-washable, so if you don't want to spot or dry clean your comforter, this is a great choice.Who shouldn't: This comforter is not suited for those wanting a super lightweight and airy one. It's also not for anyone needing a twin or twin XL size.Pros:Natural down and wool fillFeatures organic cottonFluffy and breathableCons:Expensive ($399 for a full/queen)Not available in twin or twin XL
$399 at Birch
Caroline Igo/CNET
Layla Down Alternative Comforter
Best down alternative cooling comforter
$229 at Layla
Why we chose this comforter: Down alternative comforters are eco-conscious and typically more affordable. Made without animal features or fur, the Layla Down Alternative Comforter feels pretty close to the real thing. The cover is made from 100% cotton, and its fill consists of 700-fill power down alternative fibers. Layla calls this fill Cluster-Loft, which is soft, fluffy and designed not to retain heat.Who should get it: This is a great choice if you want a comforter that feels like down without using any bird feathers. Instead of the usual baffle box design, Layla's comforter has an octagon pattern that keeps the fill from piling at one end. I would say that this can be a stand-alone comforter or a duvet insert. If you decide on the latter, it has four anchor loops.Who shouldn't: This comforter is not overly soft or cool to the touch, so if that's what you want, this won't be the one for you.Pros:Fluffy, light and the cover is made of 100% cottonOEKO-Tex certified fabricAvailable in gray and white color optionsCons:Not cool to the touchNot too soft
$229 at Layla
Aly Lopez/CNET
Cozy Earth Silk Comforter
Best silk cooling comforter
$936 at Cozy Earth
Why we chose this comforter: Cozy Earth's Silk Comforter is where silky luxury and cozy comfort meet. The outer shell is crafted with 100% bamboo viscose, while the fill is 100% mulberry silk. Silk comforters aren't always the most cooling, but this one is breathable, moisture-wicking and cool to the touch. Hot sleepers should go with the standard fill option.Who should get it: As the most expensive comforter on this list, it's only for those wanting to splurge. "It's my favorite comforter of all time," says CNET sleep writer Aly Lopez. "I tend to sleep hot and kick the covers off (especially since we don't have air conditioning), but I haven't had to do that. It's substantial but still airy, so it's cozy without making me overheat. I thought it would feel warmer, but I can still sleep temperature-neutral all night."Who shouldn't: Because of its delicate materials, this comforter requires gentle spot cleaning or dry cleaning. If you want a comforter you can throw in the washer and dryer, skip this one. It's also not for those on a budget or for really hot and sweaty sleepers. Pros:Soft, silky and luxuriousHas snap closures and loops for securingMoisture-wicking and breathableCozy without being too hotCons:Expensive, retailing at $936 for a queenRequires special care for cleaningWrinkles easilyNot for super hot sleepers
$936 at Cozy Earth
Other cooling comforters testedWhile they didn't make my list, a few other comforters have features worth noting. Here are my honorable mentions.Casper Lightweight Humidity Fighting Duvet
See at Walmart
Casper Lightweight Humidity Fighting Duvet: It's made with a 100% cotton shell and filled with ethically sourced down. An added layer of merino wool helps to wick away moisture. While it doesn't have the typical baffle box design, there are sewn-in long rectangles that keep the down in place. There are also anchor loops for a duvet cover, which is a good idea considering the duvet isn't too soft.Ultimately, this duvet didn't make my list due to the price. The Brooklinen Down Comforter is lighter, softer and costs less.Sleep Number True Temp Blanket
See at Sleep Number
Sleep Number True Temp Blanket: I like that this one comes in five fun colors. Out of all the comforters I tested, this had the most variety. The blanket is lightweight but feels a little rough. The cover has a 300 thread count and is made of cotton and polyester. I would say it's cool to the touch, but not as cool as the others on my list. It is filled with polyester and what Sleep Number calls 37.5 technology, which refers to material embedded with volcanic minerals that wick away moisture.This is more of a blanket than a comforter. You can still use this as a cooling comforter; I just wish it were softer and more comfortable.Best cooling comforters compared

How I tested the best cooling comforters
I slept with a different comforter each night to analyze and compare each one. Caroline Igo/CNETI considered each comforter's materials, feel, weight, cooling properties, size and price. I then used one comforter each night, in addition to some daytime lounging. The comforter I normally sleep with consists of a light duvet insert and a white duvet cover. However, during my testing, I didn't put a duvet cover over any of the comforters (honestly, most don't need a cover). Note that if you choose to use a duvet cover, the cool-to-the-touch sensation and breathability of your comforter may be affected.You won't find a comforter, duvet or blanket that will stay ice cold for the entire night, but these cooling comforters contain temperature-neutral materials that won't retain any body heat. Some have a cool-to-touch feel that I noted, but be aware that these comforters won't feel that cool all night.What to consider when choosing a cooling comforterMaterialThe best cooling comforters will be made of cotton, bamboo, linen, eucalyptus and/or microfiber, while the best cooling covers will be made of nylon, polyester or spandex.SizeSome brands don't offer cooling comforters in a twin or twin XL size. However, you can always size up if you want that oversized look and feel.ThicknessHot sleepers should look for a lightweight and thin comforter. However, if you prefer fluffier bedding, a thicker and airier comforter containing temperature-neutral materials will still work.PriceBedding can be expensive, but high-quality comforters are available for around $150 to $250 for a queen-size. Comforters with more luxury materials (such as silk or bamboo) may well be over $300 or $400.AllergiesIf you have allergies or asthma, it's important to sleep with hypoallergenic bedding. This can reduce your exposure to dust mites, mold and other allergens.
Best cooling comforters FAQ
What is the best material for a comforter to keep you cool?
The best cooling comforters will be made out of cotton, bamboo, linen, eucalyptus or microfiber. Cooling covers will be made of nylon, polyester or spandex. Steer clear of heavy comforters.
Do cooling comforters actually work?
Some cooling comforters may feel cool to the touch, but this sensation won't last all night long. The material inside the cooling comforter is what works. These types of comforters are made from material that won't retain body heat and remain temperature-neutral. A cool-to-the-touch cover is only an added bonus.
How much do cooling comforters cost?
You can find cheap cooling comforters for around $50 on Amazon, but the higher quality comforters that will actually regulate your temperature can cost you anywhere from $150 to $300. Hot sleepers should look for cooling comforters made of materials that won't retain heat, such as flannel, wool and down that's not lightweight.
Are all cooling comforters light?
Not all. While some cooling comforters are lightweight to help people in the summer, some all-season cooling comforters still have a heavier feel and sensation that might be familiar to a regular duvet. If you'd like something heavier, we recommend all-season comforters or those with a silk insert.
What is the healthiest type of comforter?
Comforters made of organic and natural materials like cotton, down, and wool are better than those filled with polyester. Polyester-based comforters can accumulate significant amounts of dust mites.
Should I buy a comforter or a quilt?
It depends. A quilt is generally better for hot sleepers because it is much thinner than a comforter. However, it may lack the versatility of a comforter.
Should I add a duvet cover?
A duvet cover adds extra protection to your comforter, but it can change the feel and how warm or cool you sleep. If you tend to overheat at night, go for a duvet cover made from cotton, bamboo or sateen. That way, you’ll still enjoy the cooling effects of your comforter.
