What sounds are best for sleep?
Cole Kan/CNETIf you're a light sleeper who's sensitive to sound, then you know how difficult it can be to catch some Zs. Fortunately, devices like sleep headphones now exist, and they're designed to help you get consistent, quality rest no matter what's going on around you. I, a CNET sleep team expert, teamed up with David Carnoy, CNET executive editor and resident headphone expert, to find the best sleep headphones, ranging from wireless Bluetooth earbuds and headbands to active noise-canceling, over-ear headphones. We considered price, comfort, battery life, sound quality and special features during our testing. What are the best sleep headphones overall?The Ozlo Sleepbuds take the crown as the best overall sleep headphones thanks to their comfortability and functionality. In addition to streaming your own audio, you can block out extraneous noises by listening to soothing soundscapes from its built-in sound library. These headphones also have a neat alarm feature.

Battery life Up to 10 hoursANC, PNC or other Passive noise cancelingHeadphone type In-earConnection type Bluetooth When they were released in 2018, Bose's noise-masking Sleepbuds were hailed as game-changers for light sleepers and those dealing with sleeping partners who snored. Alas, Bose ran into some issues with the battery on the original model and the second-gen version and ended up discontinuing the Sleepbuds, much to the chagrin of a lot of folks who really liked them. Well, three former Bose engineers acquired the rights to the Sleepbuds and have now come out with new Sleepbuds under their new Ozlo brand. They feature the same design as the original Sleepbuds -- the buds and charging case essentially look identical -- but have a key new feature: You can now stream other audio to the buds from your phone over Bluetooth (the original Sleepbuds just stored the noise-masking sounds on the buds and didn't allow for streaming music).Why we like these sleep headphones: One of the Sleepbuds' biggest strengths is how tiny they are and how comfortably they fit most people's ears (they come with four different-sized ear tips). I didn't have any wearability issues with them, even though I'm a side sleeper. They're not active noise-canceling earbuds, but they have good passive noise isolation and do a very good job eliminating ambient sound when you apply one of the masking sounds, whether it's waves crashing on the beach, falling rain or the crackling of a burning fire. You can also set a personal alarm to go off in your ears so your sleeping partner isn't disturbed, and the buds can sense when you've fallen asleep while listening to music and automatically kick in your chosen noise-masking sound. Finally, there are also some sleep-monitoring features.Who should get them: While testing, we found these headphones comfortable in every sleeping position. This is easily one of the best sleep headphones for side sleepers out there.Who shouldn’t: The main drawback of these earbuds is the battery life. It's only rated for 10 hours, which is significantly less than many of the others on this list. Another quirk is that you have to keep the buds' case nearby because the case is used for streaming and charging. So if that's a big factor for you, you might want to look elsewhere. All in all, I was impressed with this new iteration of Sleepbuds and hope there are no battery issues going forward.-David Carnoy, CNET executive editor

Battery life 28 hoursANC, PNC or other Active noise canceling (ANC)Headphone type In-earConnection type None The QuietOn 3.1 Sleep Earbuds are nearly three times smaller than the Apple AirPods. They effectively cancel lower-frequency, consistent sounds such as snoring, car traffic, a running dishwasher or the bass from songs your annoying neighbor blasts at midnight. The earbuds come with foam tips in four sizes so you can find the right fit for you.Why we like these sleep headphones: The QuietOn 3.1 Earbuds come with a compact carrying case for easy traveling and charging. The headphones' materials are high-quality and durable and the battery life is impressive, lasting up to 28 hours on a single charge. They're expensive at nearly $300 but if you're consistently losing sleep because of snoring and other disruptive noises, these may be worth it.Who should get them: The QuietOn 3.1 Earbuds are surprisingly tiny and light, fitting snugly into your ears so you can sleep in every position, including your side -- although, at first, I had to adjust my head while sleeping on my side to prevent unwanted pressure from the earbud against the pillow. I typically don't like wearing earbuds but I found these to be more comfortable than most other brands I've tried. For active noise cancellation to work correctly, you have to wear the right size of foam tip in your ears. The fit should be snug and airtight, which may be uncomfortable for those with extremely sensitive ear canals. I tried the XS and small sizes before finding the medium to be much more effective at reducing the noises around me.Who shouldn’t: These headphones do not have Bluetooth, so don't get them if you want to listen to your own music. Instead, they actively cancel out ambient sounds by generating opposite waveforms against the noise. This technology doesn't create any sound you can hear, like faint white noise, contrary to what I had expected. They're like advanced earplugs -- the goal is quietude. It's important to note that these headphones do not block everything. You can still hear higher-frequency sounds and sudden noises, which can be good if you want to hear certain things, such as your alarm clock.I tried a few simulations and found that it significantly reduced lower-frequency sounds. As for snoring, I could still hear it faintly next to me when the snoring simulation was at full volume, but it was much less noticeable.Editor's note: The QuietOn 3.1 earbuds are now out of stock, so we included a link to the QuietOn 4 earbuds in their place.

On the expensive side at $155
Battery life Up to 20 hoursANC, PNC or other Noise maskingHeadphone type Over-ear headbandConnection type Bluetooth We chose the Manta Sound Sleep Mask as the best sleep mask with headphones. It has tapered C-shaped eyecups that you can move and adjust to fit comfortably. I love that the eyecups are spacious enough to prevent pressure on your eyes and keep your eyelashes from being smushed -- a bothersome element of most other sleep masks.Why we like these sleep headphones: The adjustable C-shaped eyecups allow you to lie comfortably in any position, including side sleeping. It's surprisingly comfortable, considering its bulkier design. I've never woken up at night because the mask caused discomfort. Thanks to its perforated design for ventilation, it doesn't make me overheat as I thought it would. With a battery life of up to 20 hours, you can wear Manta Sleep for two to three nights without charging it.Who should get them: I think these are some of the best sleep headphones for side sleepers that you can get. Not to mention, the Manta Sound Sleep Mask's sound quality is impressive. Like most other sleep headphones, songs with heavy bass sound slightly tinny at full blast but at around half to three-quarters volume are perfectly acceptable. These headphones do a great job of creating more of a surround-sound experience and the speakers are adjustable, so you can slide them to wherever is comfortable on your ears.Who shouldn’t: My only qualm is that it tends to slide off at some point as I toss and turn so I wish the velcro on the back was grippier. It effectively blocks out the light in our bedroom, which is saying a lot because we live in the heart of a city and our bedroom has large windows with only a day shade. The more affordable Lightimetunnel Sleep Headphones from Amazon are ergonomic and made of soft, breathable material that's comfortable for wearing over your eyes.Read more about the Manta Sound Sleep Mask in our full review.

Cannot play your own audio
Expensive at $180
Have to adjust volume on each earbud separately
Battery life Up to 16 hoursANC, PNC or other Noise maskingHeadphone type In-earConnection type None The SoundOff Sleep Earbuds have unique functionality and design. There's no Bluetooth connection, so you can't play your audio; instead, these headphones use proprietary technology to emit a pink noise that specifically masks the frequencies of snoring and other noises that can disturb your sleep.Why we like these sleep headphones: With its bendy, moldable material and distinctive shape that hugs around the back of your ear like a hearing aid, the SoundOff Sleep Earbuds stay on securely -- much better than others we tested. They're also comfortable for all sleep positions, including side sleeping and combination sleepers who flop around at night. The memory foam tips mold nicely to your ears, creating a snug fit. Each headphone has a volume button on the bottom, so you have to adjust them individually. I personally don't love having to adjust them separately, but it could come in handy in certain scenarios -- such as wanting to wear only one earbud or having hearing loss or sensitivities in one ear and not the other.They come with a neat charging case that can charge your SoundOff Earbuds for up to seven days before they need to be charged again. For that reason, they're super portable and great for traveling.Who should get them: These headphones emit a pink noise that sounds like ocean waves, which is a calming soundscape shown to improve sleep. Pink noise has high and low frequencies, helping to drown out distracting noises of various tones and pitches. These headphones don't completely block out super loud noises (with the TV on high volume, I could still faintly hear it through the headphones), but they sufficiently mask out most sounds -- especially snoring. My partner spends a good chunk of the night snoring and I can't hear him at all with these on.Who shouldn’t: These earbuds are comfortable (even for smaller ears), yet take some getting used to. Whenever I take them out after wearing them for a while, I've noticed that it leaves a lingering sensation of the earbuds still being in and around my ears for a while -- but again, I have particularly sensitive ears. The Bedphones Sleep Headphones are another highly rated option. They have super thin on-ear speakers with a wire that wraps around your ears. You can choose between wired and wireless. Each comes with an in-line microphone, so you can also answer phone calls with them.

On the expensive side for the quality at $120
With its various colors, sizes and material options, you can find the perfect SleepPhones Headband for your preferences. I tested a small size of the wireless Bluetooth option in the breeze fabric and I like how snug it is around my head. It doesn't slide around too much as I switch positions at night.Why we like these sleep headphones: The SleepPhones Headband by AcousticSheep is soft and comfortable. I appreciate that the battery lasts up to 24 hours on a single charge and that the band is machine-washable once you remove all the electronic components. I also appreciate that these are multi-purpose headphones.You can also wear this band while working out, but if you plan on doing that, I recommend the moisture-wicking breeze fabric option rather than the fleece. I also advise choosing the breeze fabric if you sleep hot, as the material is more breathable. On the flip side, the fleece option is ideal for those who want a warm and cozy headband. The brand also offers RunPhones Headphones specifically for working out and running.Who should get them: This thin headband is comfortable in any sleeping position, including your side. You can adjust the position of the speakers by sliding them to the correct spot over your ears inside the headband. The main Bluetooth module piece is on the back of the headband, so I can feel it slightly when lying on my back, but it's not uncomfortable or bothersome. Who shouldn’t: If you're listening to a song with a lot of bass on full blast, the sound quality isn't the best (and my partner could hear it lying next to me). If you're wearing these to bed, you're likely listening to gentle soundscapes, an audiobook or podcast or calming music; in those instances, the sound quality is perfectly fine (and my partner could not hear it). The SleepPhones won't mask all the noises around you -- I could still hear our white noise machine and the television on low while wearing these headphones and listening to meditation music.

Battery life Up to 14 hoursANC, PNC or other Noise maskingHeadphone type Over-ear headbandConnection type Bluetooth The Musicozy 5.2 Sleep Headphones are nice for this price. They won't remove extraneous noises like noise-canceling headphones do, but the sound quality is impressive. The speakers are adjustable, so you can move them within the band to fit comfortably over your ears. It's often on sale for less than $20 at Amazon.Why we like these sleep headphones: The spandex-nylon material of these headphones is light and breathable. I found the band so comfortable that I forgot I was wearing it during the day as I worked, which leads me to my next point. In addition to sleeping, the Musicozy Headphones are great for listening to audio while working, doing yoga, meditating or exercising -- and a bonus if you're exercising outdoors in cooler weather as they'll provide a little extra warmth. Note: It will not fit under your helmet if you try to wear the headband while skiing or snowboarding. I tried.This headband has a wireless Bluetooth connection and can play continuously for up to 14 hours, providing more than a night's sleep on one charge. I've found it's closer to 10 to 12 hours, and I've been charging it daily.Who should get them: These headphones are going to be most comfortable for back and stomach sleepers. I found them decently comfortable while on my side -- I just had to position my head slightly so it wasn't pressing the speaker into the side of my head.At full blast, cheaper headphones sometimes produce crackling or static sounds -- but not these. My partner could hear my music slightly in bed when I had it at full volume, but half volume was plenty loud for wearing while sleeping. If you prefer to keep your phone out of reach to avoid scrolling at night (guilty as charged), you can easily adjust the volume with the buttons on the front of the headband instead of your phone.Who shouldn’t: I found that the Musicozy sleep headphones tended to move around when I was sleeping, which tends to happen with sleep headbands. If you still want affordable sleep headphones that serve multiple purposes, check out Musicozy&apos;s Sleep Mask Headphones. The technology is the same as the cheaper version, but they have a sleep mask shape to block out light, making them great for sleeping and traveling.

Not great for side sleeping
Wire may get tangled when sleeping
Battery life N/AANC, PNC or other Noise maskingHeadphone type In-earConnection type Wired I found the Maxrock USB-C Sleeping Earbuds to be shockingly comfortable. The soft and squishy silicone earbuds are on the smaller side, which works better for my small ear canals (regular earbuds like AirPods are too large and uncomfortable for me). The tips of the earbuds have a double-layer design that fits snugly for better sound quality. I can wear them in my ears for an extended period without my ear canals feeling sore like other earbuds tend to.Why we like these sleep headphones: Given their size, the tiny speakers in each earbud provide surprisingly decent sound quality. It's not great if you're listening to a song on full blast, but it's ideal for listening to audiobooks, podcasts or relaxing soundscapes and music at a lower volume while sleeping or working. These earbuds are also excellent for traveling and flying and come with a nice little carrying case.Who should get them: The Maxrock Sleeping Earbuds are perfectly comfortable when sleeping on your back. I eventually experienced slight discomfort and pressure from the earbuds while sleeping on my side and stomach, and I didn't appreciate the cord falling over my face. Regardless, they're an excellent value for the quality at this price and are best suitable for back sleepers who don't move often throughout the night.Who shouldn’t: If you’re a side sleeper looking for wired earbuds, this one isn’t it. The wire is my main qualm when sleeping with these budget headphones. If you toss and turn at night, as I do, a wireless set is better to avoid getting tangled or accidentally ripping one out while switching positions. This particular set of headphones connects with a USB-C port. If you're looking for affordable wired headphones for sleeping with a 3.5 mm audio jack, check out the cheaper Maxrock Sleep Earplugs instead.Keep in mind that wired earbuds have the potential to be a nuisance (or even unsafe) if you toss and turn while sleeping.

Do not actively cancel noise
Battery life Up to 14 hoursANC, PNC or other Passive noise cancelingHeadphone type In-earConnection type Bluetooth Anker's second-generation sleep buds offer some modest but important improvements, including better battery life and new "Twin-Seal" ear tips instead of single-layer ear tips that provide a tighter, more comfortable fit and 3x better passive noise reduction, according to Anker. Like the earlier Sleep A10 buds, the Sleep A20 buds are tiny and lightweight and have a good value compared to sleep buds like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which cost more and have similar features.Why we like these sleep headphones: Their flat design means they fit entirely inside your ear (or at least most ears), making them suitable for side sleeping with your ear resting against the pillow. To be clear, there is no active noise canceling. The buds themselves passively block out some ambient noise. Then you can choose to play one of a wide selection of sleep noises, including white and brown noise, plus the typical soothing sounds of nature (rain, chirping birds, fire crackling, waves crashing) that help mask external sounds like your partner's snoring.The Sleep A20s also feature the ability to play your own music and audio via Bluetooth 5.3 from your phone or another device. The sound isn't half bad, considering how small the buds are. They're a bit bass-shy but should sound "good enough" for most folks.As mentioned, the battery life has also been improved. You can now get up to 14 hours on a single charge for sleep sounds or closer to 10 hours if you're using Bluetooth. The charging case stores an additional 55 hours.Who should get them: If you want sleep headphones that are comfortable for side sleepers and don’t care about noise canceling, you’ll like the Anker Sleep A20 Earbuds. With their MEMS sensor, these headphones can also track your sleeping positions and movements throughout the night, providing sleep data and analytics. You can also set an alarm that sounds on the buds so only you, not your sleeping partner, hear it. The Sleep A20 Earbuds are among the most feature-rich sleep buds I've tested.Who shouldn’t: They're quite comfortable for in-ear earbuds, although if you don't like having an ear tip covering your ear canal, I can't guarantee you'll be able to wear them all night. I like the fit of the Ozlo buds slightly better, but the Sleep A20 buds fit my ears well overall.Stay tuned for our full review of the new Soundcore A30 Sleep Earbuds, recently released on Kickstarter.-David Carnoy, CNET executive editor

Our CNET editors have tested a variety of headphones for sleep over the years. Aly Lopez/CNETHow we test sleep headphonesOur experts analyze the following criteria when testing and reviewing sleep headphones and earbuds for sleeping:Comfort: In the end, sound quality and noise cancellation are irrelevant if the sleep headphones are uncomfortable. We tested the headphones in each sleeping position (side, stomach and back) to determine how accommodating they felt from the perspective of different sleeper types. We noted whether they applied too much pressure against the head in a particular position, which can cause pain and headaches. Headphones that cause discomfort can adversely affect your sleep, so finding a comfortable and virtually imperceptible pair is crucial.Noise cancellation or masking: We tested the headphones in various situations and environments, primarily focusing on snoring simulations and loud sounds such as television or music. The snoring simulations were played at a high volume on the bedside table to test the headphones' abilities to block out or actively cancel noises. We also tested them with real snoring by our partners who snore.Security or stability: Part of sleep headphones' wearability and comfort includes how well they stay in place throughout the night. If your earbuds constantly fall out or your headband slides off, it's annoying and makes staying asleep difficult. We analyzed this by switching positions and intentionally moving around during our testing process (and unintentionally moving around while sleeping at night) to see how well each pair of headphones stayed put.Sound quality: We tested the headphones' sound based on each pair's unique capabilities. There should be no cracking or static sounds, and the quality should be good enough to minimize sudden changes in sound that can disrupt your sleep. They should also have adjustable volume levels and clear audio -- especially if you're listening to audiobooks or podcasts.Battery life: Charging a device daily can be tedious (and easy to forget). You don't want to crawl into bed, eager to put on your headphones and fall asleep, only to realize they're dead. A pair of headphones that can last at least two nights without a charge scores extra points.Special features: Some brands offer additional features or perks that enhance the functionality of the headphones, such as a free audio library, adjustable sizing and machine-washability.Price: Headphones and earbuds for sleep range drastically in price, from budget-friendly options under $30 to top-of-the-line products costing hundreds of dollars. We included a variety of headphones, so you can find a pair that works regardless of the price.
We test all features and functionalities of the sleep headphones, including machine-washability for brands that promote it.
Aly Lopez/CNETRead more: How We Test Products and ServicesWhat to consider when choosing sleep headphonesFirst and foremost, you should consider the type of headphones you want to wear while sleeping. Do you prefer earbuds that fit snugly in your ear canals, over-ear headphones or bands that wrap around your head?Secondly, do you prefer to listen to your own music, soundscapes or audiobooks, or do you simply want to cancel out the extraneous sounds around you? Do you want to mask everything out by listening to white noise? Knowing this will help narrow your search as it will help determine whether you need a device that allows you to connect to Bluetooth or plays a type of colored noise, such as white, brown or pink.Any decent set of headphones can play music or sounds, but the design of sleep headphones that you find comfortable is most crucial. Regular headphones are often too bulky to sleep in, whereas headphones for sleep are intended to have a minimal, nearly imperceptible feel so you won't notice them at night. In deciding the best sleep headphones for you, consider the following key features:Wear preference (in-ear, over-ear or headband)Functionality (streaming audio, noise-canceling or white noise)Battery lifeComfortabilityWired or wirelessPricingHow sound affects sleep Sound significantly influences your sleep quality -- positively or negatively -- depending on the scenario. Here are examples of each:Negative impact: Recent studies have shown that environmental noise (especially cars, city or transportation sounds) can decrease your deep and REM sleep while increasing your awake time. Those annoying extraneous noises keeping you up at night provoke a biological stress response in your body, which is detrimental to your sleep quality. As a result, those who sleep in noisy environments are at greater risk of feeling groggy the next day, often experiencing mood changes, annoyance and decreased brain functioning.A lack of sleep from sound disturbances at night has long-term health consequences, which is why using a pair of sleep headphones can be beneficial in this scenario. Canceling or blocking out those unwanted sounds can help you fall and stay asleep longer.Positive impact: Listening to audio for sleep -- particularly relaxing music or soundscapes -- affects our brain and body. Soothing music can shift the focus in your brain from stress-inducing thoughts to a more relaxed state, which helps to lower your heart rate and blood pressure. This makes it easier to fall asleep.When listening to music at around 60 beats per minute (the same as the average relaxed human heart), "entrainment" can occur when your body synchronizes with its environment (in this case, the beat of the song), which promotes relaxation.It doesn't have to be slow-tempo songs; listening to any music you enjoy can release dopamine in the brain, promoting pleasure and reducing stress and anxiety. Adding music or soothing soundscapes to your bedtime routine can be a great way to mask unwanted extraneous noises and train your body and brain that it's time for sleep. Is it safe to wear headphones while sleeping?
There are a few things to consider to sleep safely while wearing headphones -- particularly earbuds. Aly Lopez/CNETGenerally, yes, but there are caveats to keep in mind. Dr. Meredith Broderick, sleep neurologist and Ozlo medical advisory board member, explains, "The headphones should be comfortable so that they don't cause any skin irritation and shouldn't have any wires that would get tangled up in hair or pinch the user. Volume control is also very important to protect against noise-induced hearing loss. The volume should stay below 60 decibels. That's one of the reasons I recommend the Ozlo Sleepbuds; they check all the boxes."Hearing damage: Your device's volume should always be kept below half the maximum to prevent damage or hearing loss. Listening to audio that's too loud for too long increases your risk of damaging the tiny hairs in your ear that help you hear.Infections or impacted earwax: If not cleaned regularly and adequately, in-ear headphones can cause discomfort or bacterial infections. Earbuds can trap moisture in your ear canal, especially if you go to bed soon after showering. Wearing in-ear headphones for long periods can create a breeding ground for bacteria to grow and earwax to accumulate or become impacted, so be sure to stop using them if you feel discomfort or pain.Headaches: Sleeping with headphones or earbuds can cause headaches if worn improperly. If the headband or headphones are too tight, the pressure around your head and ears can cause external compression headaches. Earbuds that put too much pressure inside the ear canals can cause headaches. In addition, listening to audio that's too loud can cause strain and discomfort. Emergencies: Another caveat is that noise-canceling headphones may prevent you from hearing your alarm in the morning or possibly if there's an emergency, such as a fire alarm. What sounds are best for sleep?The best sounds to listen to while sleeping depend on your individual needs and preferences. "White noise is probably the best for masking disruptive sounds, since it covers all sound frequencies. But some people may prefer instrumental music or nature sounds, like rain or the ocean," says Broderick.According to Calm, certain soundscapes and genres of music offer sleep-enhancing benefits, such as:Instrumental music (soft piano music or a strumming guitar)Classical music (peaceful orchestral pieces like Chopin or Mozart)Nature sounds (waves crashing or rain falling)Ambient music (creates a peaceful mood through tone or texture and doesn't have a rhythmic beat)Songs with slower tempos, particularly those around 60 to 80 beats per minute with low amplitude, also have specific sleep-inducing benefits. A song with this slow pace can prompt the brain to synchronize with the beat, which can help you fall asleep faster. Additionally, songs with certain low frequencies, namely 432 Hz, are thought to have calming effects on the body and promote sleep by reducing sleep latency and increasing the time spent in deep sleep.
Sleep headphones FAQs
How loud should my music or audio be while sleeping in headphones?
Headphones and earbuds can reach 100 decibels (dB) or more, which is much too loud for extended listening. To put it into perspective, sounds above 70 dB are considered damaging to our ears over time (70 dB is about the volume of a normal conversation between two people). A safe level for headphones is 50 dB or below. You can use a sound meter, which is available for under $20 on Amazon, to test the volume level of your headphones.
What are the benefits of wearing headphones while sleeping?
As Dr. Broderick explains, "Sleep headphones can block disruptive environmental sounds like traffic, snoring or noisy neighbors. There are some studies showing that auditory masking, like white noise, can improve sleep in noisy environments. Listening to music, nature sounds or bedtime stories can be relaxing and a great way of reducing stress and winding down for sleep, as well as a sleep ritual to train the body to recognize as a preparation for sleep."
What type of headphones are most comfortable to sleep in?
It comes down to personal preference. If you don't like the feeling of earbuds jammed in your ears, you'll find over-ear headphones or headbands, like the Manta Sound Sleep Mask, more comfortable.If you don't like the feeling of wearing a snug-fitting headband all night, earbuds, such as our top pick, the Ozlo Sleepbuds, may be your best bet. Overall, lightweight earbuds or headbands that don't stick out too far will be the most comfortable to wear while sleeping.
Do sleep headphones help with tinnitus?
Certain headphones have the potential to help with tinnitus (ringing in the ears) as long as the volume is not too high. Too high a volume could worsen tinnitus by causing more damage. Some brands design their sleep headphones with tinnitus in mind, such as SleepPhones. If you wear a comfortable pair at low-volume, noise-canceling headphones can help relieve tinnitus symptoms by creating a more controlled listening experience so the ears aren’t as stressed or strained. However, not everyone with tinnitus will find relief with sleep headphones. It is best to talk with your primary care provider or an audiologist about wearing sleep headphones to help with tinnitus.
Can sleep headphones help with anxiety or insomnia?
Sleep headphones can help anxiety and insomnia sufferers. By delivering calming sounds directly to your ears, they can help mask distracting noises while providing soothing audio that lowers your heart rate and reduces stress hormones. Many people report that guided meditations, nature sounds or gentle music played through sleep headphones help create a consistent bedtime routine that signals to their brain that it's time to wind down. While they're not a replacement for professional treatment of severe sleep disorders, they can be valuable to your sleep hygiene routine.
Can sleeping with headphones damage your ears?
Sleeping with headphones is not inherently dangerous. However, wearing ones that are ill-fitting or put too much pressure on your inner ear can be uncomfortable and potentially lead to damage. It’s also important to ensure you don’t listen to your music too loud or wear earbuds for too long without taking a break.
