Waking refreshed and ready to take on the day means getting a good night's sleep first, and that can be surprisingly difficult. Whether your partner has a tendency to snore, you're in need of a new mattress or just want to block out the howl of jet engines as you head on a summer vacation, one possible solution is a good pair of earplugs. Some people resort to wearing a pair of wireless earbuds, but that's suboptimal for all kinds of reasons. After all, quality sleep is essential for your health and well-being, including mood and energy levels. So why not use something built specifically for the job at hand? Earplugs are a simple, affordable way to block out noise at night and sleep peacefully.Choosing the best pair of earplugs isn’t just about blocking sound. Comfort, fit and irritation-free wear are just as important. After putting a variety of options to the test, we’ve rounded up the top earplugs for different needs, whether you’re battling snoring, sleeping on your side, traveling frequently or just want something simple to toss after use.What are the best earplugs overall?The best earplugs for you will depend on exactly what you want out of an earplug. If you have small ears and want something disposable, try Mack's Slim Fit Foam Earplugs. For adjustable earplugs, we recommend Loop Dream Earplugs. Eargasm Squishies are also great for those who sleep on their side.Best earplugs for sleeping

Earplugs cover the ear canal instead of fitting inside; failing to use them as directed could lodge them in your ear canal
If you're strictly a side sleeper, Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Putty Earplugs are the best sleep earplugs for the money. They're made of soft, fully moldable silicone that conforms to your ear opening and forms an airtight seal that blocks out noise.Aside from the fact that they could be shaped for a perfect fit, these earplugs were soft and comfortable. They stayed completely flat on my ear opening so they didn't hurt to wear. They also stayed in all night; a feat that many standard earplugs haven't been able to accomplish. Most important, these moldable earplugs did an excellent job at blocking snoring and any other ambient noise (like three large cats play-fighting in the middle of the night).The six pairs also come neatly packaged in a plastic carrying case, which keeps the silicone clean and free from debris between uses; a small but appreciated touch.Additional details: Price: Less than $5Reusable: Up to five uses/nights or until earplugs are no longer sticky Noise reduction rating: 22 decibels NRRComfortable for side sleeping: Yes  Ease of use: Don't fit like "regular" earplugs so may take some getting used to

More expensive than Mack's product but a similar product
The Eargasm Squishies are another moldable silicone option similar to Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Putty Earplugs. The biggest difference, besides the color, is in the directions. Mack's silicone earplugs must be used whole; you can't break them or cut them apart. Eargasm says if the earplugs are too big, you can break off a piece to get that perfect fit. This is helpful if you have small ears and find that using the entire silicone earplug feels too intrusive.The comfort level was also similar, although the Eargasm Squishies had a slight advantage because I could break off a piece and make it a little smaller. The Eargasm Squishies also comes in a convenient carrying case with eight reusable pairs.Additional details: Price: Less than $20 Reusable: Yes but it's unclear how many uses you'll get per pair Noise reduction rating: 22 decibels NRRComfortable for side sleeping: Yes Ease of use: Easy to use

Not designed for multiple use
The Mack's Slim Fit Foam Earplugs look like any regular old foam earplugs but if you have small ears, you may feel the difference in quality immediately. They quickly formed an airtight seal and muffled sound instantly. Loud snoring went from a roaring thunderstorm to a minor distraction that was easy to tune out. These particular earplugs have a noise reduction rating of 31 dB. For reference, most earplugs on the market have a rating of 0 to 30 dB, and the higher the number, the more effective they are. Mack's Slim Fit Foam Earplugs are specifically made for small ear canals. Finding the right earplug size makes a huge difference in effectiveness, so keep that in mind. If you don't have small ears, you can still take advantage of Mack's advanced snore-blocking technology with its Snore Blockers or Original Soft Foam Earplugs. If you go with any of these options from our best sleep earplugs list, make sure you thoroughly read the directions before putting them in your ears. One of the most common reasons these types of earplugs get a bad review is because they're not inserted properly.Additional details: Price: Less than $20 Reusable: No Noise reduction rating: 31 decibels NRRComfort: Great for small ear canalsEase of use: Easy to use

Not that comfortable for sleeping unless you're a back sleeper
The Vibes Hi-Fidelity Earplugs are different from the others on this list. They're actually designed for live music festivals so rather than blocking out noise, the intent is to lower the decibels of the sound around you to make the noise more manageable. This makes them the ideal choice for traveling when the noise can get overwhelming but you don't want to be completely checked out from the world as you take a quick snooze. When tested at a store and coffee shop, they did an excellent job blocking out voices, reducing pitches and dulling loud music.You can also use them for sleeping at home but only if you're strictly a back sleeper. The earplugs have a stem that sticks out straight from your ear canal so not only are they uncomfortable when you're sleeping on your side but they could also get pushed too far into your ear and cause problems. The earplugs come with three ear tip sizes so you can find the ideal fit for your ear canal and a small carrying case that makes them easier for travel. Additional details: Price: Less than $30 Reusable: Yes Sound reduction: Up to 22 decibels (NRR is 15 decibels)Comfortable for sleeping: No Ease of use: Easy to use

Not very easy to switch tip sizes
These reusable silicone earplugs come fixed with a "loop" for making easy adjustments once they're in your ear. Loop Dream Earplugs come with four sizes of tips you can choose from to fit your ear canal, which is more selection than a lot of brands. Fixing a new tip size back onto the earplug isn't the easiest process and requires some focus and finesse. Hopefully, you'd only have to switch tips once or twice to find your size, then only when you clean them.  Based on reviews, these Loop earplugs seem to work well for some side sleepers. From our testing with side sleeping, they would require some getting used to for longer or everyday use. Because of their easy movement and sleek look, these earplugs would come in handy when you want to turn down the volume and focus. They're available in lilac, black and peach.

Happy Ears is a Swedish company known for its sustainable packaging and recycled material for its earplugs. Happy Ears makes earplugs from ocean plastics and recycled plastics. There is also an "original" earplug that isn't made from recycled plastics. Even if you don't buy recycled earplugs, the Happy Ears packaging is recyclable, biodegradable and compostable. We tested the Original Discovery Pack, which means a package of earplugs comes in small, medium and large sizes for you to choose from. The earplugs are small and straightforward and fit inside the ear canal well. The recycled material earplugs come in black. The earplugs made from ocean plastics are green and reduce two additional decibels of sound.Additional details: Price: Less than $40 Reusable: Yes Sound reduction: Up to 25 decibels (original earplug)Ease of use: Very easy Comfortable for side sleeping: Mostly

How we chose the best earplugs for sleepingWhen selecting the best earplugs for sleeping, we tested them the only way you can: by wearing them to bed. While testing, we noted each selection's fit, comfort and quality for the best earplugs for sleeping. We also considered how many decibels the earplugs could reduce, or noise reduction ratings when they were available. Official noise reduction ratings are usually slightly different (and lower) than the average decibel or sound reduction listed because they take into account other factors, Vibes says on its website. Factors to consider when choosing earplugs for sleep There's a lot of variety in earplugs. What works for someone else might not be the best choice for you because of size, shape and material. Here are a few things to look out for. Safety: It's important to know whether you're a good candidate for sleeping in earplugs. People who have an ear infection, a build-up of earwax or other concerns about their ears should check with a doctor before wearing earplugs to sleep. To avoid an infection from wearing your earplugs, you should dispose of disposable earplugs as directed and follow the instructions for your reusable plugs on how to clean them.Material: This will determine the quality and comfort of the earplugs. Typical materials used are Silicone, wax, foam and cotton. Foam is typically the most common earplug material because it's the cheapest. On the other hand, Silicone is what you'll find most reusable options made out of. Wax earplugs give you the benefit of molding them to the shape of your ear. Noise or sound reduction This is an important one. The noise reduction rating tells you how many decibels the earplugs block. The rating ranges from 0 to 33 dB. So, earplugs with a higher NRR score block out the noise the best. Whether they're reusable: Earplugs are available in either single-use or reusable options. There are benefits and drawbacks to each. Single-use earplugs are typically cheaper and suitable for occasional use. If you're looking to use them regularly, it's best to invest in reusable options; they're better for the environment and way more durable. Price: We all know price is one of the most important parts of shopping for the best earplugs for sleep. A pack of disposable earplugs can seem like the obvious choice based on price, as most packs average around $10. Reusable earplugs may be better suited if you're looking for a long-term option. They cost a bit more, but you only need to buy them once.
Best earplugs for sleeping FAQ
What kind of earplugs are best for sleeping?
The best kind of earplug for sleeping will depend on preference, although the good options will fit snugly in your ear canal without causing discomfort. During our testing, we found the best earplugs for sleeping to be: Mack’s Pillow Sock Silicone Putty EarplugsEargasm SquishiesMack’s Slim Fit Foam EarplugsVibes Hi-Fidelity EarplugsLoops Dream Earplugs Happy Ears Earplugs
What earplugs block the most sound?
No earplugs completely block out sound. When testing, we found that Mack’s Pillow Soft Silicone Putty Earplugs did a great job blocking snoring and other ambient noise. Earplugs that you can cut or mold to your ear canal will have an edge on those that can’t when blocking sound.
Is it comfortable to sleep with earplugs?
Your sleeping position may be a determining factor in how long it takes you to get used to sleeping in earplugs or whether you love them. Back sleepers typically experience the least amount of problems. Stomach and side sleepers may find that certain earplugs may backfire and make noise as they come in contact with the pillow. Selecting earplugs that don't stick out of your ears will help side sleepers avoid this.
Is it safe to wear earplugs every night?
Usually, yes, as long as you use them as directed. There are side effects you should be aware of. Earplugs may cause earwax buildup and cause ear canal damage if used incorrectly. You also shouldn't use them if you have signs of an ear infection, like drainage or pain. If you have reusable earplugs, make sure to follow the directions and regularly clean them. Always throw away the disposable earplugs. Using earplugs that have bacteria on them can lead to an infection.
Why does sleeping with my earplugs hurt my ears?
If you're finding that you wake up with ear pain, you could be experiencing problems with earwax and infections. To prevent this you'll want to make sure to properly clean the earplugs and make sure to safely clean your ears regularly.
Can earplugs completely block out snoring?
No earplugs can eliminate sounds completely and that includes snoring. However, some options will perform better than others for this specific purpose. During our testing, Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Putty Earplugs proved particularly effective at blocking snoring sounds. For the most effective results, ensure your earplugs fit properly -- an airtight seal will mean maximum noise reduction. If snoring remains an issue despite using one of these top earplugs, you might want to consider combining them with other solutions like white noise machines.
What are the best alternatives to earplugs?
Earmuffs, noise-cancelling headphones and waxed earplugs are popular alternatives to earplugs. They are a good option if you are sensitive to wearing earplugs or find them uncomfortable to use overnight.
Can earplugs push in earwax?
Yes, earplugs can sometimes push earwax deeper into the ear canal. This happens especially if they are inserted forcefully or used frequently. Over time, it can lead to buildup or even blockages. To avoid it, insert earplugs gently and clean your ears regularly. You can also use earplugs designed to minimize pressure on the ear canal. Other products for drowning out soundLoud or abrupt sounds can be harmful to your sleep quality but not everyone will benefit from earplugs. Besides sleep earplugs, here are other products you can use to help drown out unwanted or disruptive noise and get a good night's sleep. White noise machinesHeadphones for sleepMeditation appsProducts to help stop snoring
