Some people love the sinking, coziness of a memory foam mattress as it forms to their body. It’s not hard to see why; the top memory foam beds alleviate pressure points while also maintaining that comfortable plushiness. But there are a lot of options out there. That’s why our experts put together this list to include multiple memory foam types so you can find options from light and responsive to dense and viscous. We have a range of types from all-foam to hybrid and selections for all budgets. Together, we've tested around 350 beds over the past eight years, sorting through the sea of online mattresses to find the best memory foam beds for improving your rest. Our Picks

I'm lying on the Nectar Premier in my home during a 30-night trial of the mattress. Dillon Lopez/CNETAfter testing hundreds of memory foam mattresses from countless brands, our sleep team has crowned Nectar Premier the best overall memory foam mattress. This comfortable bed features an accommodating profile at an affordable price. Quality memory foam mattresses under $1,000 are hard to come by, and after factoring in Nectar Sleep's frequent discounts, you can snag a queen-size Nectar Premier memory foam bed for $950. It sits just above a medium on the firmness scale, meaning it can work for all sleeper types, including back, stomach, side and combination. Nectar Premier

Best memory foam mattress overall
Nectar Premier
Pros
Affordable after discounts, especially compared to competitors
Doesn't sleep hot like other memory foam beds
Thicker than many all-foam mattresses
Available in a hybrid model
Cons
Not ideal for side sleepers who want a plush mattress
All-foam may not be supportive enough for heavier individuals and couples
Nectar Sleep offers four tiers of beds in all-foam and hybrid options: Classic (12"), Premier (13"), Luxe (14") and Ultra (15"). Given its medium to medium-firm level, Nectar Premier has an accommodating profile most sleepers will find comfortable -- even if you're unsure about memory foam. My partner and I slept on Nectar Premier in our 30-night mattress testing series and were pleasantly surprised by how much we enjoyed its slightly airier memory foam feel.Why we chose this bed: Nectar Premier is comparable to a high-quality Tempur-Pedic but without spending nearly as much. It has dense memory foam that initially feels somewhat firm but slowly softens and begins to hug your curves as your body heat warms it. Still, Nectar's memory foam is slightly more responsive than your traditionally dense and viscous foam. It offers a nice balance of contouring without feeling totally "stuck," meaning it's a little easier to switch positions if you're a combination sleeper.At 13 inches tall, the Nectar Premier has multiple foam layers, including an 8-inch foundational foam layer, a 3-inch layer of support foam for spinal alignment, a 2-inch layer of pressure-relieving memory foam and a breathable cover with cooling fibers. I don't consider the cover actively cooling, but it does help you sleep temperature-neutral through the night -- which is atypical of memory foam beds, as they tend to sleep hot.Who should get this bed: The all-foam Nectar Premier bed is best for petite to average-size people who want the sinking, contouring sensation typical of memory foam. Additionally, if you or your partner tend to toss and turn at night, the Nectar Premier does a great job of deadening movement across the mattress. This motion isolation means you shouldn't feel one another flopping around much.Who shouldn't: If you're a heavier individual seeking the most support and durability from your bed, you'll want to opt for the hybrid model. Side sleepers seeking more pressure relief should check out Nectar Luxe, Nectar's softest beds. Strict back or stomach sleepers wanting extra spinal support should consider the firmer Nectar Classic collection.Read full review  ... Show more

Best flippable memory foam mattress
Layla Memory Foam
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Two firmness options in one mattress
Accommodates all sleeping positions
Queen size is often on sale for under $1,000
Responsive memory foam that most sleepers will like
Cons
Heavier sleepers should consider the Layla Hybrid for more support
Not actively cooling
The dual-sided Layla Memory Foam mattress is one of our sleep team's favorite beds, appearing on several of our CNET best lists. There aren't many flippable mattresses out there, let alone premium memory foam beds with a low price tag like this.Why we chose this bed: This mattress offers two firmness profiles, so you can find the perfect fit. If one side isn't working, all you have to do is flip it over. Our experts found the "soft" side around medium-soft and the "firm" side medium-firm. The soft side is plush and pressure-relieving for your joints, meaning it's great if you're a side sleeper. Though the firm side isn't a true firm, it still provides decent spinal support when we lie on our stomach and back.Who should get this bed: The Layla Memory Foam mattress features light and airy foam, which differs slightly from traditionally dense memory foam. It's somewhat bouncier and more responsive, meaning you won't feel as stuck when switching positions. It's a great choice if you're looking for a mattress with a slight memory foamy feel and some body-hugging sensation, but not an overwhelming amount.The Layla mattress has copper-gel micro-beads fused into the foam, intended to help wick away your body heat as you sleep. Even with its cooling technology, this mattress sleeps more temperature-neutral than actively cooling, which is still pretty good for a memory foam bed.Who shouldn't: If you're a super hot sleeper who wakes up constantly doused in night sweats, you'll want to check out our list of the best cooling mattresses or, at the very least, the best cooling sheets. Heavier people should also opt for the Layla Hybrid over the all-foam for its added durability and weight support.Read full review  ... Show more

Best memory foam mattress under $500
Allswell Supreme
7.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Affordable price at $487 for a queen
Coil system for enhanced durability
Medium firmness level suits combination and side sleepers
Optional cooling cover
Cons
Only one firmness option
Not for you if you want that super dense memory foam sensation
Likely too soft for back and stomach sleepers
Walmart's Allswell mattresses are some of the best affordable beds we have tested. The Allswell Supreme offers the most memory foam sensation of all the beds in the line, and for $487 for a queen-size, it's quite a steal.Why we chose this bed: Walmart has updated the look of the Allswell Supreme mattress since our team tested it, but the construction is essentially the same. It's 14 inches tall and has a support system of individually wrapped coils, making it supportive for all body types. The plush pillow top mixed with the "fast response" memory foam underneath creates a comfortable sleep surface with a slightly slow-to-respond feel but less dense than typical memory foam.Who should get this bed: Our mattress experts agree it feels right around a medium on the firmness scale, making it best suited for side and combination sleepers who want some cushion around their shoulders, hips and knees. You also have the option to add the quilted cooling cover for $50, which we think is a good move if you sleep hot at night.If you're on a budget looking for a durable hybrid mattress with a slight memory foam sensation and a plush pillow top, the Allswell Supreme is a solid choice. Few beds check all those boxes for under $500.Who shouldn't: If you're a strict back or stomach sleeper, you'll likely want something a little firmer to help keep your spinal in a neutral position as you sleep. In that case, check out the Allswell Brick.Read full review  ... Show more

Best memory foam mattress under $1,000
Bear Original
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great value; discounts can bring the price down to $649 for a queen
Memory foam lovers will enjoy the feel of this bed
Great for back and stomach sleepers
Option to add a Celliant-infused cover
Cons
Not soft enough for side sleepers
Not as supportive as a hybrid mattress
The Bear Original mattress is another longtime favorite of our sleep team. Retailing for $998 for a queen-size, it's usually on sale for even less than that. Around holidays and deals events, it's as low as $649.Why we chose this bed: The Bear Original has a medium-firm profile, which our objective Mattress Smasher 900 device rated as 7.65 out of 10. It's ideal for back and stomach sleepers seeking a mattress that supports their spine without feeling too firm.Its construction includes three different foam layers: high-density support foam on the bottom, Bear Dynamic Foam as a comfort layer and cooling gel memory foam. Overall, the bed has a dense memory foam feel -- you'll slowly sink into the layers as your body heat warms the foam, and it's slow to respond once you get up.Who should get this bed: This dense foam also provides great motion isolation, which is good news if you or your partner tosses and turns throughout the night. Since it has an all-foam design, it's best suited for petite to average-sized individuals seeking a budget-friendly memory foam bed.Bear's optional Celliant-infused cover is an extra $200. The brand refers to this as "Sleep Recover Technology," intended to help regulate your body temperature and promote physical recovery as you sleep. Bear notes that more research is needed to fully confirm these benefits, but in one study, Celliant increased oxygenation and helped participants sleep longer. While our team can't necessarily prove or disprove this, one of our experts slept on this mattress for years and felt it made a difference.Who shouldn't: Bear incorporates some cooling features in the Original mattress, such as gel memory foam, but we do not consider this mattress actively cooling. It sleeps more temperature-neutral. If you're a super hot sleeper, consider adding Bear's Celliant cover or check out the best cooling beds. If you're heavy, you'll want to skip this mattress and seek a hybrid bed instead.  ... Show more

Best luxury memory foam mattress
Amerisleep AS6 Black Series
8.76
/10
SCORE
Pros
Cooling technology is great for hot sleepers
Crafted with premium materials, including plant-based Bio-Pur
Hybrid construction makes it more durable
Multiple firmness options
Cons
Expensive at $3,649 for a queen
Amerisleep's AS6 Black Series is a bit more luxurious than the AS1 through AS5 models. Amerisleep uses a proprietary plant-based memory foam called Bio-Pur. Its open-cell design allows for more airflow, making it slightly more responsive and breathable than traditionally dense memory foam.Why we chose this bed: Aside from its sleek design, one of the first things we noticed when lying on this premium bed is that the foams conform around your body faster than beds like Tempur-Pedic, responding pretty quickly when you switch positions. It provides a nice combination of contouring with responsiveness that we think most sleepers will appreciate. Its hybrid construction makes it durable and suitable for all body types, from light to heavy.Who should get this bed: Hot sleepers: listen up. One of our favorite features of this bed is its cooling technology. We immediately noted that the "CryoCool" cover is genuinely cool to the touch as the fibers draw heat away from your body. The "ArticWave Cooling Bands" and the "TitanAir" layer also help dissipate heat, helping you feel cooler through the night.The Amerisleep AS6 Black has three firmness profiles to choose from, so there's an option for every type of sleeper. We tested the luxury firm model, Amerisleep's most popular choice. Despite its name, our mattress testers found it to be more around a medium on the firmness scale, and the Mattress Smasher ranked it 4.5 out of 10, so it's certainly not what we would consider truly firm. It's a nice middle ground for couples and combination sleepers who spend time in each position.The plush model is better suited for side sleepers seeking pressure relief, while the firm option is best for back and stomach sleepers.Who shouldn't: If you're on a tight budget, this luxurious mattress is not the bed for you. The queen-size Amerisleep AS6 Black Series retails for $3,649, so it's in that more premium price range. After factoring in Amerisleep's frequent discounts, you can snag this bed for $1,000 off, bringing the price down to $2,649 -- still expensive, but not terribly so for a bed of this quality (especially comparatively to luxury cooling beds from other brands like Tempur-Pedic).Read full review  ...

Best memory foam mattress for side sleepers
Nectar Luxe
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Soft profile is ideal for side sleepers
Feels cool to the touch
Dense memory foam sensation for those who want that
Cons
Expensive; a queen-size retails for $3,265
Not for those needing a hybrid bed
Too soft for strict back and stomach sleepers
The 14-inch Nectar Luxe is one of the softest premium memory foam mattresses we have tested. It offers a dense memory foam feel that contours all your curves and provides plenty of plush pressure relief for your joints.Why we chose this bed: This mattress is perfect if you're looking for a soft memory foam bed that will cradle you in all the right places. We were initially surprised by how soft this mattress is, landing between medium-soft and medium. Our Mattress Smasher confirmed this, providing an objective rating of 3.37 out of 10.The construction is pretty straightforward: an 8-inch base layer of foundational foam, a 3-inch layer of responsive support foam and a 3-inch layer of plush memory foam on top. Like the Nectar Premier, the foam is slightly airier and more responsive than traditional memory foam, making it a little easier to switch positions, but still providing that body-contouring sleep surface.Who should get this bed: If you spend most of the night on your side, you'll appreciate how pressure-relieving this mattress is. You shouldn't have any issues with pain in your shoulders or hips or numbness in your arms.If you tend to sleep hot, you'll be happy to know that the Nectar Luxe's cover is noticeably cool to the touch and offers some active cooling -- which is relatively rare for a bed with dense memory foam.Who shouldn't: Since this bed has an all-foam construction, it's best suited for petite to average-sized individuals and couples. Heavier people should opt for a hybrid mattress with supportive coils for enhanced durability and longevity.  ... Show more

Best hybrid memory foam mattress
DreamCloud Hybrid
8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Firmer profile is ideal for back and stomach sleepers
Durable and supportive hybrid design
Affordable price backed by solid policies
Cons
Not for those wanting a bouncy latex feel
Not for those seeking a soft or plush bed
Hybrid mattresses tend to be more expensive than all-foam mattresses, but the DreamCloud Hybrid mattress has a price tag rarely seen for one with memory foam like this. Retailing for $1,531 for a queen, the brand frequently offers discounts, taking the price as low as $649.Why we chose this bed: It's not as dense as some of the other beds on this list, but it has what we would consider an overall neutral feel that leans toward firm memory foam. It's 12 inches tall and features an 8-inch layer of individually wrapped coils on the bottom as its sturdy support system, followed by a layer of adaptive foam for proper spinal alignment and contouring memory foam on top.The "CloudQuilt" cover on the DreamCloud Hybrid mattress is breathable but not actively cooling. You'll likely sleep more temperature-neutral than truly cool on any of DreamCloud's current offerings.Who should get this bed: Our sleep experts agree that it lands between medium-firm and true firm, making it one of the firmest DreamCloud mattresses we have tested. The Mattress Smasher rated its firmness 7.1 out of 10, slightly softer than expected. Still, this means it's ideal for back and stomach sleepers seeking more support than pressure relief.Given its strong hybrid design, it's also great for heavier individuals and couples who want their new mattress to last.Who shouldn't: Side and combination sleepers should look for a softer, more pressure-relieving mattress than the DreamCloud Hybrid.Read full review  ...

Best cooling memory foam mattress
Copperflex Pro
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Comes in hybrid and all-foam options
Cooling technology is ideal for hot sleepers
Excellent price for a bed of this quality
Traditional dense memory foam feel for those who want that
Cons
Not for those wanting a soft bed
Skip if you don't like the feel of memory foam
Brooklyn Bedding crafts quite a few of our sleep team's favorite beds. The Copperflex Pro is an excellent option if you're a hot sleeper seeking a memory foam bed at a budget-friendly price.Why we chose this bed: The Copperflex Pro is the best memory foam bed for hot sleepers because of its cooling technology -- and at such a low price, it's hard to beat. It has a classically dense memory foam feel that slowly sinks in and conforms to your body's curves. It has a firmer profile, so you likely won't be sinking in too much.The Copperflex Pro is available in hybrid and all-foam options. If you're heavier or want more support in your bed, we suggest opting for the hybrid version. The all-foam model has a base layer of "Variflex" transition foam, which is a super-dense support foam. On top of that are four layers of different types of foam, including lumbar support foam, contouring comfort foam and two inches of Copperflex memory foam infused with small copper flecks. These particles help wick away moisture to keep your body temperature regulated.The primary way this bed keeps you cool is the GlacioTex cooling cover, which we noticed was genuinely cooling immediately.Who should get this bed: When we first received the Copperflex Pro, we expected it to be relatively soft, so you can imagine our surprise when we found it to be around medium-firm. Our Mattress Smasher 9000 gave it a high firmness score of 7.9 out of 10. It's best suited for back and stomach sleepers who want a firmer sleep surface to support the spine.You should also consider the Copperflex Pro if you're a hot sleeper and need all the cooling relief you can get.Who shouldn't: The Copperflex Pro isn't for you if you spend much time on your side at night. In that case, you'll want something softer for your shoulders and hips.Read full review  ... Show more

Best cheap memory foam mattress on Amazon
Rolanstar
Pros
Three height options
Very affordable at only $140 for a king
Made with CertiPur-US certified foams
Responsive feel, so you don’t feel stuck when you lie on it
Cons
Won’t give you the support a hybrid bed can
No cooling technology for hot sleepers
One firmness option
When most people think of memory foam, they think Tempur-Pedic, which comes with a hefty price tag. The Rolanstar mattress is a cheap alternative that still gets you that slow, sinking sensation at only a fraction of the cost.Why we like this bed: The Rolanstar is easily one of the most affordable mattresses we’ve ever tested, which is why it earned a spot on our best cheap beds on Amazon list. Despite being only $110 for a queen, Rolanstar doesn’t feel cheap. The quality surprised us. It’s an all-foam mattress with the sinking sensation you get from memory foam, without the stuck-in-the-mud feeling that something like Tempur-Pedic has. I’d describe it as a responsive memory foam feel that snaps back fast, so it’s easy to move around and change positions. One of the biggest complaints about memory foam is that it takes too much effort to move around. You won’t get on the Rolanstar mattress; it fills back in pretty quickly after you lift your weight.When testing, we said this bed is a medium to medium-firm, suitable for combo sleepers or anyone who spends time on their back and stomach some of the night. Some strict side sleepers might find it too firm. This bed has three height options. Who should get it: I’d recommend the Rolanstar mattress to anyone who wants a truly cheap memory foam mattress. It won’t have all the bells and whistles like zoned support or cooling covers, but it’s a good bed for the money. Who shouldn’t: I wouldn’t recommend it for heavier people or anyone looking for a bed that will stand the test of time. Sometimes, memory foam can sag without the coil base, so you run that risk. The bed also probably isn’t for hot sleepers; it has a bamboo charcoal foam layer, which is supposed to help wick away moisture at night, though we didn’t think this bed did anything in the temperature department.  ...

Factors to consider when choosing a memory foam mattress
Firmness: This should be one of the primary considerations, regardless of the type of mattress you're buying. Different firmness levels accommodate various sleeping positions. If you're a side sleeper, the best memory foam mattress must be softer and more plush to alleviate pressure around your shoulders, knees and hips.Firmer mattresses are better suited for back and stomach sleepers who need extra firmness and support to keep their spines neutrally aligned throughout the night. A mattress that's too soft can cause your back and midsection to droop or sag uncomfortably into the bed, potentially leading to pain or soreness. Combination sleepers who spend time in multiple sleeping positions should consider a middle-of-the-road medium firmness level.Feel: These days, not all memory foam mattresses are built alike. Some feel light, airy and more responsive, while others are denser and slow to respond. If you're a combination sleeper, I recommend opting for a lighter memory foam mattress as it will be easier to switch positions -- you won't be met with as much resistance. Conversely, if you like to get ultra-cozy and nestled into the bed's layers while you sleep, you'll want a bed with dense and viscous memory foam.
Part of our testing process includes removing the mattress cover and analyzing its interior construction and materials. Dillon Lopez/CNETConstruction: I mentioned it multiple times already, but beds with coils or innerspring systems are better if you're heavier. They provide enhanced durability and longevity, and the coils don't break down nearly as fast as foam. Plenty of solid hybrid beds offer a traditional, dense memory foam feel. All-foam beds are great for petite to average-sized individuals and couples.Temperature regulation: One common downside with memory foam is that its dense foam tends to retain heat, which can make you feel hot and uncomfortable. Memory foam's dense cell structure is generally not very breathable, trapping air inside. Additionally, you're more surrounded by material as you sink into the bed's foam layers, rather than lying on top of it like with latex foam or classic innerspring beds.If you're a hot sleeper but want memory foam, look for one with cooling technology or temperature-regulating features such as infused gel, gel beads, infused copper, infused graphite, phase change materials, cooling covers and other proprietary technology.Price: Memory foam beds range drastically in price, from very cheap -- there are memory foam mattress options out there that cost as little as $200, such as Amazon's Rolanstar -- to premium and top-tier memory foam mattresses like Tempur-Pedic that cost well over $2,000. That means almost anyone can find a memory foam mattress within their budget. How we test memory foam mattresses
Over the years, CNET's bed experts have developed a thorough and standardized methodology for testing every mattress that enters our mattress warehouse and testing facility. We have unboxed, rolled around on, tested, smashed, slept on, cut open and moved more mattresses than we can even count. We have mattress testers of all body sizes, genders, heights, weights and sleeping preferences so that we can test the beds from a wide variety of perspectives. The primary characteristics we analyze and review include mattress construction and design, firmness, feel, temperature regulation, motion isolation, edge support and any other special features the bed may offer. We test each mattress from all sleeping positions, including side, back, stomach and combination. We take turns lying on and analyzing each bed's firmness level and overall feel, comparing our deductions with the hundreds of other mattresses we have tested over the years.
Dillon Lopez/CNETThanks to our one-of-a-kind Mattress Smasher 9000, developed by CNET's brilliant lab technicians, mattress firmness can be examined subjectively and objectively. After placing the bed on the designated platform, we align the Smasher's actuator arm in the middle of the bed and activate the corresponding software. The arm presses into the mattress with a preset amount of force, measuring how far down into the bed it travels using a system of lasers. It then provides an objective score on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the firmest. We conduct at least five tests for each mattress, taking the average as the final ranking.Sorted from softest to firmest, here's how the Mattress Smasher scored the best memory foam mattresses on this list. In our mattress facility, we test motion isolation, edge support and temperature. When we can, we zip the covers off or cut open the protective fire socks to further analyze the mattress construction inside. At this point in our sleep careers, we deeply understand how a bed's construction informs every aspect of its performance, from durability to longevity to comfort.There's much more to our testing procedures than the simplified overview here, so if you want to learn more, this is a complete rundown of how CNET tests mattresses. CNET editors choose the products and services we write about based on editorial merit. When you buy through our links, we may get a commission.
Other memory foam mattresses we tested
There are tons of mattresses on the market, which can make shopping overwhelming. Luckily, our CNET sleep editors have been around the bedding block. Over the last eight years, we have collectively tested well over 300 beds, from the most popular brands to lesser-known models. We have the experience and expertise to help you sort through the chaos and choose the best for you. If none of the beds above seem like the right fit, here are a few more that we have tested and would also recommend.Casper Snow: I slept on the Casper Snow Hybrid mattress for 30 nights and loved it. It has that dense memory foam sensation and impressive cooling technology. I never felt like I was overheating on this bed. It's another fantastic option if you're a hot sleeper looking for a memory foam bed that won't overheat. It sits right at a medium firmness, making it ideal for most sleeping positions.Casper Snow

Lucid 10-Inch Gel Memory Foam: Budget shoppers should check out the Lucid Gel Memory Foam mattress, a bed sold through Amazon with thousands of positive customer ratings. It's one of the most affordable bed-in-a-box beds we've ever tested, and it's still comfy enough to provide a good night's sleep. There are three firmness options and six height profiles to choose from.Lucid 10-Inch Gel Memory Foam

Tempur-Pedic Adapt: We'd be remiss not to include Tempur-Pedic on our best memory foam mattress list. The Tempur-Pedic Adapt mattress has that classic, ultra-dense, viscous memory foam feel. It's not responsive -- you'll sink in gradually, the foams will conform around your curves and it'll return ever so slowly to its original position if you get up or move. If you have the budget, this is another great choice for memory foam lovers.Tempur-Pedic Adapt

What are the types of memory foam?
Not all memory foam is the same. Some are airy and light, while others are very dense. Some are infused with gel or copper for enhanced temperature regulation, while others are more traditional.Traditional: Traditional memory foam is found in older beds, such as the OG Tempur-Pedic mattresses from the 90s or beds with very cheap memory foam. While it can still provide a contouring sensation and pressure relief, it also gets hot because the dense foam traps your body heat. If you're a hot sleeper, this is something to consider.Gel-infused: Gel-infused memory foam often has gel particles or beads infiltrated throughout the foam to help regulate temperature. The gel draws heat away from you and more evenly disperses it throughout the bed for a cooler memory foam feel.Copper-infused: Beds like the Layla mattress are infused with copper gel to work like regular gel-infused mattresses. Copper is a conductor that can absorb heat from your body and disperse it away.
You can see tiny flecks of copper in the top and bottom layers of the flippable Layla mattress. My Slumber YardPlant-based: There aren't many plant-based memory foam mattresses on the market. Brands like Amerisleep use plant-based materials as a substitute for petroleum and manufacture it using a zero-emissions process. This way, the memory foam is more environmentally friendly than most other memory or poly foams.Proprietary: Many brands use a specific name for their memory foam, such as Puffy's Cloud-Air foam. It's the brand's take on memory foam to make it more comfortable, cooling or accommodating. The most common types of proprietary memory foam are open-celled for more airflow or gel-infused for cooling abilities.Learn about why the type of foam in your mattress matters.
Memory foam mattress FAQs
What is the best memory foam mattress?
There are many memory foam mattresses on the market, but our team chose the Nectar Premier as the best overall. Other great models come from brands like Tempur-Pedic, Layla, Puffy, Saatva, Bear, Amerisleep and DreamCloud.
How long do memory foam mattresses last?
If your memory foam mattress is made entirely of foam, it'll probably last around seven years. If it has a hybrid design with innersprings or coils, it'll likely last around 10 years or more. All-foam mattresses are generally more affordable than their hybrid counterparts, but it's important to consider longevity when evaluating the prices.Proper care of your mattress is essential to extending its lifespan. This includes rotating it every six months (if your specific bed allows it), using a protective mattress cover and keeping your bedding clean. Learn more about our team's tips for 12 easy ways to make your mattress last longer.
What is the best thickness for a memory foam mattress?
A memory foam bed around 10 inches tall should offer ample support for most adults. We recommend thicker mattresses, around 12 inches or more, for heavier individuals or anyone who wants extra cushioning, durability or height. Thinner memory foam mattresses are fine for the short term, but won't last as long as thicker beds. They tend to be more susceptible to sagging and wear and tear.
Are memory foam mattresses good?
Memory foam can be a divisive feeling, so it depends on your preferences. Memory foam mattresses can relieve pressure around your joints as the material hugs and cradles your curves. Some memory foam beds give you a sinking sensation that causes resistance when you switch positions.
What are the negatives of memory foam mattresses?
Memory foam mattresses can trap heat, making hot sleepers even warmer at night. They also sometimes provide resistance to combination sleepers when they switch positions. If you're a combination sleeper in the market for a memory foam bed, try to find one that's lighter and airier so it responds quicker. Softer memory foam mattresses may also sag too much for heavy stomach or back sleepers.
What type of memory foam mattress is best?
It depends on your needs. For most sleepers, a medium to high-density memory foam mattress will provide sufficient comfort and support. Opting for a gel or graphite-infused option might be a good choice for those who need some extra cooling relief.
Do memory foam mattresses need a box spring?
No, most memory foam mattresses don't need a box spring; it usually depends on your preferences. A box spring may affect the structure of the mattress, and your decision to opt for one will depend on the feel and height you prefer.
What kind of base is needed for a memory foam mattress?
Solid bases, platforms or slats are the most popular options for memory foam beds. Slats provide better air circulation underneath your mattress. You can use a wood base, a metal base or even opt for an adjustable base with a memory foam mattress.
Who should buy a memory foam mattress?
The best qualities of memory foam are a comforting, contouring feel, sound motion isolation and a mix of support and pressure relief. If you like the sinking sensation of memory foam that makes you feel nestled into the layers, you'll like a memory foam bed. Most couples appreciate that you can't feel one another moving around as much. Side sleepers may also love soft memory foam because of how well it cradles the shoulder and hip joints.
Who shouldn't buy a memory foam mattress?
Memory foam mattresses can sometimes turn people off for several reasons. You shouldn't get a memory foam mattress if you change positions often, as the foam can provide some resistance. It's also not ideal for super hot sleepers. Memory foam is a dense material that traps heat more than other foam beds. Gel memory foam and other tech help it sleep cooler, but people who sleep warm may want to consider a latex foam mattress because it's so breathable.
