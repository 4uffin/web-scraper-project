How we test adjustable mattresses
Other mattresses we've tested
For the sake of this list, I’m defining an adjustable mattress as a bed that lets you change how firm or soft it is. Relying on the collective experience of CNET's team of sleep experts, with over 300 beds tested and reviewed over the years, we've picked the best adjustable beds to get right now. There aren't a lot of options on the market and many of them come with hefty price tags. If that doesn't sound like an issue, here are the best adjustable beds to help you get total control over your sleep.Best adjustable mattresses of 2025I’ve rounded up the two best adjustable mattresses on the market. But first, let me define an adjustable mattress. For this list, I’m reviewing mattresses that allow you to adjust the firmness of your bed in real-time with an app or remote. This is different from adjustable bed frames and bases, which elevate the head and foot of a mattress. The beds on this list customize the firmness and do not change the elevation independently.What We Updated: April 2025We added Saatva Solaire and Sleep Number ClimateCool mattresses and removed several products that were no longer relevant.

SCORE
Pros
White glove delivery so you don’t have to worry about setup
Big selection of sizing, including upper-flex queen and king
Remote for easy adjustments
Cons
Expensive at $4,199 for a queen
The firmest setting isn’t as firm as other beds out there
The Saatva Solaire is a luxury air mattress that combines latex foam, memory foam and internal air chambers to provide a comfortable and customizable feel. The adjustable firmness makes it suitable for just about anyone. However, our testing found that it doesn’t achieve extreme firmness.Why we chose this bed: The Saatva Solaire has 50 firmness settings on either side, allowing you to adjust the bed’s firmness to your exact preferences using the included remote. This is a game-changing feature for couples with different sleeping preferences to agree on a bed. Because of the customization, this bed is virtually suitable for any sleeping position. The Saatva Solaire can hold up to 800 pounds on each side.This adjustable mattress has a layer of memory foam above the air chambers that allow you to alter the feel of the bed. On top of that, there’s a layer of latex foam. If you know anything about foams, then you know memory foam tends to be slow-moving, while latex foam is super responsive and springs back. These contrasting feels cancel out and give the bed a neutral feel, complemented by the quilted European pillow top. While testing this adjustable mattress, we found it to have solid edge support and excellent motion isolation, making it a good choice for couples. If you want more adjustments and are willing to spend more, this bed is also available in upper-flex queen and king sizing, which pairs with the Saatva adjustable base.Who should get this bed: People looking for a luxury-style adjustable mattress with a neutral feel will like the Saatva Solaire. I see it being a good choice for just about any sleeper, as long as you can afford to spend $4,199 for a queen.Who shouldn’t: When testing customizable mattresses, you expect to see the full range of firmnesses. The Saatva Solaire doesn’t deliver on the extreme end of firmness. We found it to max out at medium-firm to firm or eight on our scale. This isn’t bad for the average person but people who want an extremely firm bed will want to look elsewhere.  ... Show more

Best adjustable mattress for hot sleepers
Sleep Number ClimateCool
Pros
Customizable firmness
Cooling features are great for hot sleepers
Tracks your sleep and can help you improve your sleep quality
Cons
Advanced bases cost more
We wouldn’t describe the feeling of the bed as “plush”
The Sleep Number ClimateCool mattress is the best adjustable mattress for hot sleepers because of its airflow system. It’s easily one of the most customizable beds I’ve seen. Why we chose this bed: Like the Saatva Soliare, the ClimateCool adjustable mattress from Sleep Number combines customizable air chambers with layers of foam. This bed focuses on cooling, so in addition to the airflow system designed to keep you cool, there is ceramic gel in the bed, too.“Sleep Number's ClimateCool smart bed is a great choice for partners with different sleep preferences. Each side of the bed is customizable with adjustable temperature and firmness levels. Many couples disagree on the ideal firmness (my partner and I included), but very few mattresses offer firmness adjustability, which sets Sleep Number apart,” says Aly Lopez, CNET writer.An app that connects to your mattress allows you to adjust the firmness and temperature, along with other features that depend on your base. I’d describe the feel of this bed as an airy, memory foam feel. You get some of the slow, sinking sensation you expect from memory foam but it’s not too viscous. The most significant barrier to the Sleep Number Climate Cool mattress is its price: A queen costs $5,749. That said, the ClimateCool mattress comes with a base. Sleep Number offers three options; the Integrated base won’t add any extra cost but if you want head and foot adjustments or under-bed lighting, you’re looking at a total of $7,249.Who should get this bed: I’d recommend this adjustable mattress to anyone who wants to get technical about their sleep. In addition to allowing for firmness customization on each side, the Sleep Number ClimateCool mattress also automatically responds to your movements and tracks your sleep.Who shouldn’t: This is not a budget bed. Even with the price including a base, a minimum of $5,749 isn’t affordable. So unless you’re into getting granular about your sleep or are a hot sleeper who needs temperature control, I don’t know how practical this bed is.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing the best adjustable mattress
Adjustable mattress vs adjustable baseThe beds on this list are considered adjustable mattresses because they allow you to change their firmness in real-time. That’s different from an adjustable base that changes the incline of the sleeping position but doesn't impact the firmness you experience. The terms can sometimes be used interchangeably, but they are distinct. Customizable beds adjust the firmness of the mattress, while adjustable bases adjust the position of the mattress.Adjustable bases or bed frames have several potential health benefits, like reducing snoring, lessening acid reflux symptoms and alleviating back pain. However, they’re best suited for people who sleep on their backs. Some side and stomach sleepers may have trouble sleeping comfortably because of how the base raises the head or foot of the bed. Most beds can be used with an adjustable base, so if you’re looking to adjust the positioning of the head or foot of the bed, you want an adjustable base.Read more: Best Adjustable Bed Frames and BasesIf you find that there are times when you want a softer bed and other times when you want a firmer bed, you want a customizable bed that lets you alter the firmness. The best mattresses in this category are the Saatva Solaire and the Sleep Number ClimateCool. Sleep Number has several other models, too. How we test adjustable mattresses
CNET editors pick the products and services we write about based on editorial merit. When you buy through our links, we may get a commission.
Our Mattress Smasher 9000 testing a bed. Dillon Lopez/CNETFirmness: How firm a bed feels is very subjective and will depend on how much pressure you put on the bed. In addition to hands-on testing, CNET has recently developed a method to measure a mattress’ true firmness: a machine dubbed the Mattress Smasher 9000. This proprietary device and corresponding software were developed in-house by our lab technicians. It presses into the middle of the mattress and scores each bed on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the firmest and 1 being the softest. We also test each bed personally for perceived firmness and feel, we have data from the MS9000 to back up our conclusions.Feel: We get physical with the mattress and see what the material feels like. This is different from firmness. Depending on the foam and materials of a mattress, we see if the bed is bouncy, slow-responding, pressure-relieving or plush and fluffy.Durability: It's difficult to tell exactly how long each bed will last because we don't test it for years on end. We can hypothesize a bed's firmness by looking at its construction. Hybrid or innerspring beds are more durable and last longer than foam mattresses.Best body type: Based on a person's body weight, we determine how accommodating a mattress is. We use different-sized sleepers to test the beds and focus heavily on a bed's construction.Best sleeping position: Using different sleepers, we test the mattress in each sleeping position: side, back and stomach.Motion isolation: We use two people to test how well motion transfer across the bed is deadened, or place a glass of water at the edge of the bed to see how much it moves if we bounce around.Edge support: We analyze the construction and physically lay on the sides of the mattress to get a gauge of how supportive it feels.Temperature: Instead of getting fancy, we rely on our own experience sleeping on the bed and a temperature gun. We can tell if a bed is cooling, breathable or hot by sleeping on it for a few nights.Smell: Mattresses in a box emit a smell once they're unpackaged like a new car does. Don't worry, it won't stick around. The smell will go away after 24 to 48 hours. Some beds emit less of an odor than others.Read more on how we test mattresses. Other mattresses we've tested
The CNET sleep team has tested over 300 beds collectively. Our experience allows us to curate the best mattress lists like this one and pick the beds that stand out. There aren’t many adjustable mattresses on the market, though other beds pair well with adjustable bases. You won’t be able to customize the firmness, though the base will change the sleeping elevation.Casper One Mattress: The Casper mattress is an affordable all-foam mattress with a denser feel you expect from memory foam, though you don’t sink in as much. It’s got a firmer profile, so I really only recommend it for back and stomach sleepers.Brooklyn Bedding Signature: This is a pretty basic hybrid mattress, but it has a quality design with a surprisingly low price tag for a bed with coils. The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid bed has three different firmness levels to choose from, so anyone can sleep on it.
Best adjustable mattress FAQs
Do adjustable bed frames help with snoring?
Yes. Adjustable beds allow you to elevate your head, removing pressure on the back of your throat and opening up your airways and nasal passages, which eases snoring. They also improve circulation and relieve joint pain.
What type of mattress is best for an adjustable base?
Most bed-in-a-box mattresses are compatible with adjustable bases, but the best kind are ones that are flexible and allow for increased movement. Hybrid mattresses or beds with coils fit with adjustable bases, as well as latex foam, poly foam and memory foam beds.
What are the disadvantages of an adjustable bed frame?
There are a ton of reasons you might want an adjustable bed. There are also a few disadvantages you should consider. First, stomach sleepers may have a hard time sleeping on an adjustable bed frame. Adjustable bases tend to be more expensive than traditional options, they also can be heavy and hard to move once they are put together.
How long will the average adjustable mattress last?
Generally, you can get about 10 years out of an adjustable mattress. As long as it is properly cleaned and maintained, it may even get a few more years out of it. This will depend on the quality of the mattress purchased.
Do you need an adjustable mattress for an adjustable bed frame?
No, you don't need an adjustable mattress for your adjustable bed frame to use it. However, it is likely to shorten the lifespan of said mattress and, overall, it is considered a better idea to use an adjustable mattress.
