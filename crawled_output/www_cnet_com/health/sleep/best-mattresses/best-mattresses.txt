My years of knowledge as a certified sleep scientist and the time I've spent testing the best mattresses have confirmed one thing: there's more to beds than meets the eye. Different kinds of mattresses cater to hot sleepers, couples and even those with health issues like back pain. The gist is, you can't choose any bed online or in a store and expect to sleep well.

What are the different kinds of mattresses
With that said, here is a list of mattresses that are worth the money and will cater to any type of sleeper, backed by my research and hands-on knowledge.What's the best mattress overall?While testing mattresses for this list, I found that the Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid is the best overall mattress you can buy. It has three firmness options -- so it's great for people who prefer a firm mattress or a softer mattress -- and a durable hybrid construction, meaning anyone can sleep on this bed.
Jon Gomez/CNETThis bed is already priced well for the quality you get, but to make it even sweeter, Brooklyn Bedding offers generous sales that can knock a couple of hundred dollars off the retail price.You might notice that the Brooklyn Bedding Signature only scores 8 out of 10. While some beds may have scored higher in testing metrics on the list, I feel that the Brooklyn Bedding Signature is the best overall mattress for the average person. It's a classic mattress that's very neutral in feel.Watch: Our best mattress for 2025 video overviewWhat We Updated: July 2025Updated listicle format.Added Ashley Home Signature Design as the best cheap pillow-top mattress on Amazon.Best mattresses of 2025

SCORE
Pros
Three firmness options mean any sleeper type will be comfortable
Neutral foam feel
Affordable for the quality at $1,332 before sales
Cons
Firmest option still isn’t truly firm
Still might be out of the price range for some
The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid mattress is one of the best quality beds you can get for the money. “When my sister asked me what my recommendation was for a comfortable and affordable hybrid bed, the Brooklyn Bedding Signature was my immediate choice. She and her dogs have slept on it comfortably for years, and she was able to save even more thanks to Brooklyn Bedding’s 30% military discount,” says Owen Poole, CNET senior video producer.Why we like this bed: The flagship Brooklyn Bedding mattress is 12.25 inches tall and has a neutral foam feel that just about anyone will find comfortable. There’s plenty of support, too, thanks to the eight-inch individually-wrapped coils reinforced around the edge for increased edge support. Then two layers of foam provide plenty of pressure relief while molding to your body without sucking you in like some dense foams do. An airy topper offers a softness that memory foam just can’t achieve. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles like zoned support or foam-tipped coils, the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress is one of our favorite mattresses to recommend to people. Why? Besides the solid construction, it’s an incredibly accommodating bed. It’s available in three firmness levels: Soft (medium-soft or 3), Medium (medium or 5) and Firm (medium-firm or 7).Who should get this mattress: If you want a straight-to-the-point hybrid bed that’s comfortable, durable and well-priced, no need to look any further than the Brooklyn Bedding Signature mattress. It’s what most people want.Who shouldn’t: This Brooklyn Bedding is a great bed, but it’s not particularly advanced in additional features like cooling overs or a zoned support construction for people with back pain. I’d recommend it to the average sleeper, though not to people with specific needs.  ... Show more

Best firm mattress
Saatva Classic Mattress
9.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Dual-coil design makes it extra durable
Free white glove delivery
Three firmness options available
Lifetime warranty
Cons
Expensive at $2,099 before sales
Too firm for some sleepers, especially side sleepers
$99 fee if you want to return it
You get both plush comfort and superior support with the Saatva Classic. It’s a proper luxury mattress with a hefty construction. “My dad lives in a rural location, and he’s getting older. He’s not the best candidate for solo unboxing of a new king-size mattress. That’s why I chose to get him a brand-new Saatva Classic for his birthday. The bed was white glove delivered right to his door: a team of professionals set it up for him and even hauled away his old bed. He’s been sleeping like a baby ever since,” says CNET Senior Video Producer JD Christison.Why we like this bed: The Saatva Classic has all the essential parts that make up a classic mattress that everyone can recognize and love: a bouncy feel, an innerspring system and a comfy pillow top. That said, there is so much more going on with this bed than anything you’ve probably slept on. The construction of the 11.5-inch Saatva Classic makes it stand out. It has a dual-coil design that starts with a base layer of tempered steel coils, then comes the second layer of coils that are firmer in the center third of the bed.What I love about this bed is the classic pillow-top feel that’s responsive and easy to move around, even with the layers of memory foam underneath. You don’t sink into it because it’s so supportive, but the pillow top delivers on cushion. Not to mention, it has a 365-night trial and a lifetime warranty.Who should get this bed: Those who want a traditional pillow-top mattress that’s ultra supportive and you’re willing to pay for it will like the Saatva Classic. Every type of sleeper will enjoy it because you choose from three firmness options: Plush soft (medium or 5), Luxury firm (medium-firm or 7) and Firm (firm or 9). The firmest model is why it wins as the best firm mattress. Who shouldn’t: That said, this bed isn’t for everyone. I’d say if you’re under 150 pounds, then all the extra support features aren’t worth the money. It’s not a cheap bed, and while heavier body types will benefit from all that support, petite folks just don’t need it.  ... Show more

Best memory foam mattress
Nectar Premier Mattress
Pros
Responsive memory foam feel
Available in an all-foam or hybrid construction
Generous sales around holidays, I've seen up to 50% off
Temperature neutral
Cons
All-foam construction probably isn’t supportive enough for people over 230 pounds
Too soft for some back and stomach sleepers
Memory foam lovers and critics alike will love the all-foam 14-inch Nectar Premier for its comfort and affordable price tag with sales. Nectar does some of the most generous sales I’ve seen.Why we like this bed: The all-foam Nectar Premier is a memory foam mattress that hugs your curves as you sink into it. It reminds me of a watered-down Tempur-Pedic, though I’d classify it as a responsive memory foam feel because it’s easy to move around on. You still feel the bed cradle your form when lying down on it.It hits a sweet spot of satisfying both memory foam lovers and those (like me) who don’t prefer it. We also found it to be a touch above a medium firmness, which means that any sleeping position can enjoy it. Though side sleepers who want a soft bed might find it too firm, that said, I think the average side sleeper should enjoy it. The Nectar Premier is available in an all-foam or hybrid construction. The all-foam is a simple three-layer construction: a support foam, a transition layer and a gel memory foam comfort layer. Who should get this bed: The Nectar Premier gives you memory foam without it being off-putting to people who don’t like how sinking and dense true memory foam can be. It’s all-around comfortable and widely accommodating. I’d recommend it to people who love memory foam or those considering trying it out for the sink-in sensation. This bed also has a 365-night trial and a forever warranty, which is as generous as it gets.Who shouldn’t: You don’t want this bed if you’re looking for an extreme firmness in either direction -- super firm or super soft. It’s just a tad above medium at a 6 out of 10 on our scale. Also, the Nectar Premier is not a cooling bed despite the cooling additions to keep it from trapping heat, like the top layer of therapeutic gel memory foam with ActiveCool and a textured cover. Those things are nice to see, but won’t actively cool you.  ... Show more

Best mattress for heavy people
Big Fig Mattress
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Thick, hybrid construction
Phase-changing cover
Responsive feel
My top pick for heavy people
Cons
Firmer than some wants
Not a budget choice at $1,899. Generally, Big Fig doesn't do huge markdowns either
Big Fig is an ultra-supportive mattress designed for heavier people. This bed offers advanced support you can’t get from just any bed. Why we like this bed: The Big Fig mattress offers a responsive, firm foam feel. It won’t have the sinking feel of memory foam. Make no mistake, this is a firm mattress, though it might feel a little softer depending on how much you weigh. The average person will find it around a medium-firm to firm bed, though someone over 300 pounds might think it’s more like a medium. We’d recommend it for stomach, back and combination sleepers. The 13-inch construction is where the Big Fig mattress really shines. It has ultradurable steel coils encased in a foam border for edge support, then three layers of high-density poly foam. A gel-infused latex foam layer is the comfort layer below the quilted cover.Who should get this bed: The Big Fig is the best overall pick for heavy people because of its advanced support. People who want a responsive foam feel will like this bed, especially if they want their bed to respond immediately to their movements, rather than lag behind like memory foam.Who shouldn’t: Petite people don’t need this bed. While I don’t think the $1,899 queen price is unwarranted, you could get away with a much more affordable all-foam mattress, or a hybrid like the Brooklyn Bedding Signature for only $1,332 before sales. I’ll also say that side sleepers who want a soft bed won’t get it from Big Fig.  ... Show more

Best cheap mattress on Walmart
Allswell Mattress
7.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Only $284 for a queen is rare
Great quality for the price
Best for back, stomach or combo sleepers
Cons
Too firm for some side sleepers
Lacks additional features that other options have
Budget doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice quality. If you need a new bed and have a tight budget, you’ll be happy to know that the Allswell is an affordable and long-lasting 10-inch mattress. “I’m not sure if there’s a better value online for a hybrid mattress of this quality. It’s quite nice for the price, and if you’re a heavier person on a tight budget, I couldn’t see you going wrong with this option,” says JD Christison, CNET senior video producer.Why we like this bed: The Allswell mattress from Walmart is the perfect example of a budget bed that’s actually good. Despite being what we would consider “ultra-budget friendly,” it’s a supportive and bouncy hybrid mattress that’s surprisingly comfortable. It has a soft, neutral foam feel instead of a dense or syrupy memory foam feel that can be polarizing. At a medium-firm or 7, the Allswell mattress is perfect for back and stomach sleepers. Because the Allswell is a budget hybrid bed, its construction is pretty straightforward. You won’t see advanced additions like zoned support or cooling covers, but that doesn’t detract from the comfort or quality. The Allswell mattress has a three-layer construction with individually wrapped coils sandwiched between layers of polyfoam. It’s finished with a soft, quilted cover. Who should get this bed: If you need a long-lasting, supportive bed on a budget, you’ll like the Allswell mattress. It might lack all the extra bells and whistles, but Allswell is a high-quality hybrid bed at a fraction of the cost. I can’t think of a better value on the market.Who shouldn’t: If you’re a strict side sleeper, the medium-firm profile might cause pressure points at the shoulders, hips and knees. So, I wouldn’t recommend it to them, especially petite body types. I’ll also add that while I like the value of this bed, it isn’t going to knock your socks off with advanced features or construction. It’s an old-school, hybrid bed that’s incredibly affordable.  ...

Best cooling mattress for hot sleepers
Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe Mattress
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Physically cool when you touch it
Multiple firmness options
Soft, neutral foam feel that everyone will like
Additional pillow top available
Cons
A little expensive at $2,265
Price isn't warranted for anyone except hot sleepers
No true firm option
When it comes to cooling mattresses, no other brand does it as well as the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe. It’s one of the most physically cool mattresses we’ve tested. “As a hot sleeper, I love how I instantly can feel the cooling sensation when I lie on this mattress. If you combine this bed with light or cooling bedding, you're in good shape to decrease night sweating,” says CNET editor Caroline Igo.Why we like this bed: The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe is a 13.25-inch premium hybrid mattress that actually sleeps cool at night. But this bed is more than just a cooling solution. It’s also extremely comfortable, with a neutral foam feel. The foam layers provide pressure relief, though you’re not sinking into the bed like memory foam. At checkout, you can add a pillow top to your Aurora Luxe for a softer, airy pillow-top feel. Another point in this bed's favor is that it’s available in three firmness options: Soft (medium-soft or three), Medium (medium or five) and Firm (medium-firm or seven). Also, the firmest option of this Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe isn’t all that firm, so if you’re looking for a truly firm bed, look elsewhere. This premium mattress is five layers thick and features a mix of foam and coils. All the cooling power comes from a layer of CopperFlex foam on top and the Titan Cool cover. If you’re a hot sleeper, you’ll be hard-pressed to do better than the comfort, durability and cooling tech of the Aurora Luxe. Who should get this bed: If you’re a hot sleeper, this is the bed for you. The Aurora Luxe is a high-quality mattress that backs up the cooling claims. I don’t think the average person will find a more accommodating bed than this.Who shouldn’t: Cooling beds tend to be more expensive, and the Aurora Luxe is no exception. If you’re on a tight budget, I suggest the Cocoon Chill, our best budget cooling mattress selection.   ... Show more

Best mattress for back pain
Saatva Rx
9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Zoned support design with multiple layers of coils is good for back pain
Unique construction that you don't see from other beds
Accommodating pillow top
Cons
Too soft for some stomach and back sleepers
One firmness option available shrinks how many people can sleep on it
Very expensive at $3,399 for a queen
Saatva is a brand known for making premium mattresses that are exceptionally durable and supportive. The Rx mattress was designed to alleviate back pain from conditions like scoliosis and sciatica. Why we like this bed: When we tested the Saatva Rx mattress, the team found it on the softer side of medium on our firmness scale, a 4 or 5 out of 10. That firmness level will make it suitable for side sleepers, though it might be too soft for some back and stomach sleepers. The Saatva Rx is a 15-inch mattress with seven layers of gel memory foam, high-density foam, and durable coils. This bed's base layer of coils includes a unique feature of what Saatva calls the “Rx foam module,” which is a foam tip on each coil. If that wasn’t enough, there is an additional layer of micro coils wrapped in high-density foam. Who should get this bed: People who want a softer mattress that has a construction to alleviate back pain will like the Saatva Rx.Who shouldn’t: The Saatva Rx mattress is softer, excellent for side sleepers with back pain or people with joint pain. However, I think many back and stomach sleepers will want something firmer. The Saatva Classic mattress is a firmer alternative that will give people with back pain all the support they need.  ...

Best mattress for side sleepers
Layla Hybrid Mattress
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Two firmness levels in one bed
Great for side sleepers
Cooper-infused memory foam for temperature regulation
Airy memory foam feel isn't dense
Cons
Not a true budget choice at $1,699 for a queen
Too soft for most back and stomach sleepers
Why choose one firmness when you can have two in one bed? The Layla Hybrid mattress is a 13-inch flippable bed that provides both comfort and versatility to side sleepers. “My parents sleep on this mattress! Our team prefers the Layla Hybrid since it is a flippable bed that offers two firmness options that provide the proper support and pressure relief for side sleepers,” says Dillon Payne, CNET director of production. Why we like this bed: The Layla hybrid mattress is uniquely constructed because it’s flippable. The coils are in the center of the bed, and the foam layers are stacked around them. Among the foam on either side are layers of copper-gel memory foam as the main comfort layer. It’s supposed to also help temperature regulation and keep the foam from trapping heat. Side sleepers need as much pressure relief as possible to ensure no painful spots develop and cause joint pain the next day. The Layla Hybrid mattress does just that. The soft side of the Layla hybrid is around medium-soft, and the firmer side is a tad above medium. Neither side is truly firm, though you will get plenty of support and comfort with the firmer side. The Layla Hybrid mattress has a responsive, almost airy memory foam feel that contours your body. Not to mention, the trademark honeycomb pattern cover is super soft. I think it’s one of the only beds that looks as good as it feels.Who should get this bed: This bed is made for side sleepers, particularly ones looking for an airy memory foam mattress that gives you two options for firmness. While you might not flip the mattress over when you get it, there is comfort in knowing you have two chances to get it right.Who shouldn’t: Most stomach and back sleepers won’t get the support they need from this bed because it’s soft enough that your hips and shoulders could sink into the bed at uneven points. This would result in back pain over time. I also wouldn’t recommend this bed if you don’t care that it’s flippable.   ... Show more

Best organic mattress
Avocado Green Mattress
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Different firmness options means everyone has a model to pick
Base firmness is good for back and stomach sleepers
Made from eco-friendly materials
Endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association
Cons
An additional pillow top skyrockets the price by $1,440.
It's too firm for side sleepers without the pillow top
The Avocado Green mattress is one of the most popular beds in the organic mattress industry. It’s an 11-inch luxurious bed that uses no chemicals or glues. It has the highest number of certifications of any bed we’ve tested.Why we like this bed: The Avocado Green mattress has a latex foam feel that organic beds are known for, with a firmness that’s good for back and stomach sleepers. Latex foam tends to be naturally firmer, so you won’t sink into it. It’s also highly responsive, so changing positions won’t be an issue. Based on the additional pillow top, you can choose between three firmness levels. The Avocado Green mattress uses natural materials, such as GOLS-certified organic Dunlop latex and GOTS-certified organic cotton and wool. It also has a layer of recycled steel coils with a zoned support design that’s good for back pain. If you want to add the pillow top, you’ll get two inches of Talalay latex foam. Tufted rosettes add the finishing touch. Who should get this bed: If you want a firm organic mattress and are willing to spend the money, the Avocado Green mattress is one of the best beds you can get.Who shouldn’t: The base Avocado Green mattress has no pillow top. We rate it as a firm or nine on the firmness scale, which is best for stomach and back sleepers. Side sleepers can add a pillow top to make it softer. Here’s the thing about adding the pillow top: it will cost you. The medium pillow top costs $800 more, and the plush option is $1,680 more. It’s more expensive than what many people want to spend.  ... Show more

Best mattress for couples
Sparrow Signature Hybrid Mattress
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lifetime renewal exchange for foam layers
Has handles that makes it easier to move
Hybrid construction
Three firmness options to choose from
Cons
$2,132 for a queen is expensive
Petite couples may not need the added support
The Sparrow Signature Hybrid mattress is a luxurious pillow-top bed that scores high in all the essential factors for couples: edge support, motion isolation and temperature regulation. Why we like this bed: The Sparrow Signature Hybrid mattress from Nest Bedding is our pick for the best mattress for couples. It has a plush, pillow-top feel that’s like a cloud. It’s available in three firmness levels, which always score a bed extra points. What sets the Sparrow Signature Hybrid mattress as the obvious choice for the best mattress for couples is the split king size that allows you to choose a firmness for each side. Individually-wrapped coils are the main support layers of this 13-inch bed. On top of that comes the high-density foam layer to mask the feeling of the coils. The main comfort layer of Energex foam is a neutral foam that’s pretty responsive. The quilted pillow top has a little bit of memory foam for added pressure relief, but it doesn’t change the feel of the bed. Unique to the Sparrow Signature is a lifetime renewal exchange program. Because the top comfort layers are easily removable, Nest Bedding will replace the comfort foam even after the trial period. This could change the bed's firmness or replace sagging foams from years of use, which is not something that other brands offer. Who should get this bed: This is a luxury mattress with a plush pillow top that anyone can sleep on. It’s a great choice for people who can’t decide what bed to get. It’s comfortable and scores high in factors that matter for sleeping with another person, like edge support and motion isolation. This bed also has a 365-night trial and a lifetime warranty.Who shouldn’t: I wouldn’t say anyone should avoid this bed, it’s that comfortable. However, if you want the feel of memory foam, you won’t get it from the Nest Sparrow.  ... Show more

Dreamfoam Doze Mattress
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Neutral foam feel that you expect from classic beds
Three height options with varying prices
Ultrabudget pick at only $275 for a queen
Cons
Off-gassing smell when we opened it
Not the best for heavy people
The Dreamfoam Doze is an ultra-budget, surprisingly supportive mattress with a neutral foam feel. It has no bells and whistles, but it’s a solid choice for the average person. Why we like this bed: For being so cheap, our team was pleasantly surprised with how comfortable and supportive the Dreamfoam Doze mattress was. It has a neutral foam feel that I associate with the old-school beds that I grew up with. It’s familiar.The Dreamfoam Doze is available in a 7-, 9- and 11-inch profile. The thinnest option is the most firm, and the thickest is the softest. We tested the 9-inch model and found it to be medium to medium-firm or six on the firmness scale. It should work for most sleepers, though back and stomach sleepers will probably like it more. Many side sleepers will want the 11-inch option. Who should get this bed: The Dreamfoam Doze is the one of the best beds you can get on a budget. It’s solid, though not fancy. It’s an excellent choice for guest rooms.Who shouldn’t: The Dreamfoam Doze mattress doesn’t have all the bells and whistles you get from luxury beds. It’s a straightforward budget mattress with a foam support system, transitional foam layer and quilted top. It’s not a fancy bed, but for $275, it’s not trying to be. It’s probably not the best choice for heavy folks who need added support.  ... Show more

Best cheap pillow-top mattress on Amazon
Ashley Home Signature Design Chime - 12 inch
Pros
Hybrid design that offers support
Comfy pillow top
From a known brand
Affordable at only $350 for a queen
Cons
Motion isolation was only OK, might not be good for light sleepers
Confusing storefront on Amazon with different beds
Only one firmness option
If you’re on a budget and want a classic innerspring bed with a comfy pillow top, look no further than the Ashley Home Signature Design Chime mattress. It’s a quality option for only $350 for a queen.Why we chose this bed: The Chime mattress is an accommodating bed that has a plush, fluffy pillow top. It’s not quite as luxurious as other beds on the list, but there’s no way it would be for as cheap as it is. It’s a straightforward, comfortable bed that costs a fraction of what the other beds do. If you’re a budget shopper, this bed won’t disappoint you. It’s a proper medium, a safe firmness level for couples and combination sleepers. This is a good middle ground choice unless you want extreme firmness in either direction.I recommend the 12-inch model of the Chime mattress. Amazon has eight different height options, but unlike other brands, the beds are entirely different. So, to get the medium-firm mattress with a comfy pillow top, you must choose the 12-inch height I’m describing here.Who should get this mattress: Amazon has many cheap hybrid beds, but the Chime stands out. It’s affordable and performs better than other budget beds we’ve tested. No, it’s not going to have all the bells and whistles that more expensive beds have, but for this price, it’s hard to pass up this quality. It’s a top choice for budget shoppers.Who shouldn’t: The Chime mattress only performed OK in motion isolation. It doesn’t hold up super well compared to more expensive beds. While I think that won’t be a huge deal for the average person, light sleepers often woken up by their partner or pet might care. I recommend they opt for an all-foam bed that will absorb that movement. Try out the Tuft & Needle Kin mattress on Amazon.  ... Show more

Best mattress firmness data
Our sleep team recently developed a method to measure a mattress’s true firmness: the Mattress Smasher 9000. This proprietary device and corresponding software were developed in-house by our lab technicians. It presses into the middle of the mattress and measures its firmness to score each bed on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the firmest and 1 being the softest. While we also test each bed personally for perceived firmness and feel, we use data from the MS9K to complement our conclusions.Here's the data we learned testing the best mattresses with our Mattress Smasher 9000. Sorted from the softest beds to the firmest, here's how the mattresses scored on our firmness scale.
How to choose the best mattress
It’s easy to get lost in the industry terminology like Hyper-Elastic Polymer or zoned support and not know which bed is right for you. These things sound appealing, but not everyone will like or need every feature. The best mattress for you will suit your needs. So before you do anything, you need to consider three main points: your sleeping position, body type and budget. Sleeping positionHow you sleep will help you narrow down your mattress pool by firmness.Side sleepers will need softer mattresses to ensure they get enough cushion for their joints. Stomach and back sleepers want a firmer mattress to ensure their spine stays neutral to avoid back pain. Combo sleepers have more flexibility, although they should make the call based on the position in which they spend the most time.Your body typeYour body type also will help you determine which mattress you should choose. We always recommend that heavier folks go with hybrid beds for longevity. How much pressure you put on a mattress will also influence how firm it feels. Heavy people who put the most pressure on mattresses will find mattresses to be softer. The inverse is true for petite body types who will find things feel firmer. We base our firmness rating of 1 through 10 from the perspective of someone weighing 150 to 230 pounds.Women also have to consider breast comfort when shopping for their mattresses. Stomach sleepers need firm mattresses for spinal support, although many women find extremely firm beds painful across the chest. That’s not to say women can’t sleep on firm mattresses, although it may influence how firm of a bed you choose. Pillow tops, memory foam or padded covers can provide extra cushion to firm mattresses. PriceOnce you know what you need from your mattress, you must establish your budget. The reality is that beds are a big investment. The average online mattress costs around $1,200, although beds under $500 are available for people on a budget. Don't worry, just because they’re cheaper doesn’t mean they’re poor quality. A recent CNET survey found that more than half of adults are willing to spend $1,000 a year to attain better sleep -- especially those in their 20s or 30s -- and admitted to needing one or more accessories, supplements or systems to cope with sleep-related issues. With mattresses lasting longer and offering extended warranties -- every mattress in this guide includes at least a 10-year warranty, and some even come with lifetime coverage -- the cost can pay for itself quickly if it helps you cut back on pricey supplements or stop chasing the latest sleep app or gadget every month.Here’s another thing about mattresses: there are always mattress deals available. You should never have to buy a mattress for full price. From Memorial Day to Black Friday to every season in between, you’ll almost have access to some sort of discount.  How we test and rate mattresses
Erica Devaney/CNETOur team of sleep experts has spent years researching, testing and deconstructing over 300 mattresses. Most of our testing happens in our 6,000-square-foot mattress warehouse in Reno, Nevada. In addition to the office space where our team tirelessly compiles mattress data, there are also two mock bedrooms we use to test and film reviews in. A back room also serves as an overflow for the hundreds of mattresses the team has tested. Testing mattresses is a very hands-on process that involves analyzing the construction, feeling and rolling around on the beds from multiple points of view. Our team has a variety of genders, body types and sleeper positions, which allows us to give each bed a well-rounded view that we can compile into recommendations for the average person. Firmness and feel: Firmness and feel are some of the most subjective factors when testing mattresses. How firm a mattress feels will depend on how much pressure you put on the bed -- aka your body weight -- and this varies from person to person. We often find that our opinion on a bed’s firmness does not always match a brand’s claim.
The Mattress Smasher 9000 testing the Helix Midnight Core model.
Dillon Lopez/CNETTo get a full view of a mattress, each person in the testing facility rates each mattress we test on firmness. Then we compare it to our data set to see where a bed falls on our firmness scale.Durability and construction: We can’t sleep on every mattress we test for years to test the durability (though we have done it for some). While we note the construction of a bed, we use it to inform how durable and supportive a bed will be over time. Saatva, for example, received a 10 support score during testing because of the hefty construction and dual-coil system. Motion isolation: When I say motion isolation, I’m referring to how well a bed can dampen movement across the surface. We test this by having multiple teammates move around and measure how much motion they can feel. Memory foam tends to perform best in this area. For example, the Nectar Premier mattress scored higher in motion isolation because the memory foam layers are superior at dampening movement compared with innerspring mattresses.
CNET video producer Jon Gomez captures mattress expert Dillon Payne testing the edge support of a mattress. Aly Lopez/CNETEdge support: This one might not seem like a big deal, but edge support is important if you sleep on the edge of the bed. Think about it like how strong the bed’s perimeter is. If it caves in when we sit or lay on it, it doesn’t have good edge support and receives a score corresponding to where it falls in the data. Temperature: Many brands claim their mattresses are cooling, although very few are. While adding cooling technology or gel-infused foams can help regulate temperature, it doesn’t mean they are physically cool to the touch. We carefully assess each of the cooling features but differentiate between being temperature-neutral and cooling. For instance, Purple is a naturally breathable bed because of the grid construction, but we don’t consider it an actively cooling bed. Read more on how we test mattresses. Other mattresses we've tested
We’ve tested many other beds outside of what was included in this best mattress list. Many of them are great but didn’t quite cut earning that “best” title. Mattresses are subjective, and there’s a chance that one of these beds might work better for you.Purple Restore:No other mattress compares to the feel of the squishy, Hyper-Elastic Polymer that makes up the Purple Grid. When you lie on it, you feel almost buoyant. Not only does that give it a leg up in pressure relief, but it also regulates temperature well. It’s unlike any other bed I’ve tested. If you’re an adventurous sleeper who wants a widely accommodating hybrid mattress that will stand the test of time, get the Purple Restore mattress. While it’s not actively cooling, it does a surprisingly good job of pulling heat away from the body while you’re sleeping. So I’d also recommend it for hot sleepers.Bear Original: The Bear Original is an affordable all-foam bed that’s great for people under 230 pounds who want the pressure relief of memory foam without the slow, sinking feeling. It responds faster than other memory foam beds like Nectar or Amerisleep, making changing positions much easier. This mattress falls at around a medium-firm or seven on our firmness scale. It’s definitely firmer, so some strict side sleepers may find it too hard. However, that firmness offers great spinal support to back and stomach sleepers. I wouldn’t recommend any all-foam mattress to anyone over 230 pounds. It will be fine for a while, but it will sag faster, and you won’t get as much life out of it as you want. Just go with a hybrid bed and save yourself the headache. Helix Sunset Luxe: The is medium-soft premium mattress is a medium-soft premium mattress that gives side sleepers all the pressure relief they want. Fans of pillow tops will love its plushness. This pillow-top mattress has a mostly neutral feel, although you just have a touch of memory foam. When lying on it, you get a little bit of the sinking-in feeling, though it doesn’t overpower the neutral pillow-top feel. We rate the Helix Sunset Luxe a medium-soft or three on our firmness scale. It’s soft and will provide plenty of pressure relief where side sleepers need it: the shoulders, hips and knees. Given it’s a soft mattress, I wouldn’t recommend it to strict back and stomach sleepers who need a firmer profile for spinal support. It's also pretty expensive.WinkBed: Fans of pillow-top mattresses will love the comfort and luxury of the WinkBed mattress. It’s firm enough to support stomach sleepers and has one of the most comfortable pillow tops I’ve ever tested. It has the burly presence of a classic innerspring mattress, but modern upgrades make it seriously comfortable. It’s the type of bed you would expect to see in a fancy hotel. The fluffy pillow top feels like a cloud, and the hefty construction makes it extremely supportive. Plank Firm Luxe: Back sleepers need a firmer mattress to ensure their spine stays in a neutral alignment at night. The Plank Firm Luxe mattress is an ultra-firm mattress with a flippable design. It offers a firm and an extra-firm side. On the extra-firm side, we rate it 10 out of 10 on our firmness scale. The name encompasses how this bed feels, like a plank with a layer of foam over it. Because it’s so firm, you won’t sink into the bed at all. That means it will be extremely responsive, so you don’t have problems moving positions. The American Chiropractic Association also endorses it. I'd advise that side sleepers stay far away from this bed. Mattresses we're currently testing
CNET’s sleep team is constantly testing and reviewing new mattresses behind the scenes. These are the next ones up in our process: Amerisleep Organica&nbsp;- An organic hybrid mattress made with Talalay latex foam.Novilla Mattress - An ultra-budget gel memory foam that only costs $190 for a queen.Siena Mattress - This affordable mattress on Amazon is only $555 for a queen.Kin by Tuft & Needle - This budget bed comes in all-foam and hybrid constructions. What are the different kinds of mattresses
If you’re new to online mattress shopping, one easy way to narrow down the best mattress for you is by choosing a type of bed.
Dillon Lopez/CNETFoam mattresses are made entirely of layers of foam, whether it be polyfoam or gel foam. Each foam layer has a different density because it serves a distinct purpose in the bed. The foams with the highest density will be on the bottom because it’s the bed's structure. Latex foam mattresses are divided into two types: natural and synthetic. Natural and organic latex foam is hypoallergenic, antimicrobial and environmentally friendly. Synthetic latex foam is artificially made but cheaper than organic material. Either way, latex foam is durable, breathable and very bouncy. Latex beds are almost always very heavy, so having two people to move them is best. Memory foam mattresses are one of the most popular types because they are comfortable and excellent at isolating motion and offering pressure relief to the joints. Memory foam is often slower to respond, making it difficult to switch positions at night.Hybrid mattresses use both foam and metal coils. They’re closest in design to the innerspring mattress most of us grew up with, but the added layers of foam do wonders for pressure relief. We recommend hybrid mattresses for people who weigh over 230 pounds. Pillow-top mattresses have a padded layer on the top of the bed that’s often tufted to provide extra cushioning. They’re often made of wool, organic cotton or other light and airy materials.
Buying the best mattress FAQs
How much should I pay for a mattress?
How much you should spend on your next bed depends on your budget. The average online bed retails for around $800 to $1,200 for a queen-size mattress. But there are beds under $500 and mattresses that cost over $2,000 if you're looking for affordability or luxury.However, price doesn't necessarily mean quality. Like any product, be sure to do your research (or rely on ours) and check that the mattress comes with a generous trial period, as most do these days.
How often should you replace your mattress?
The average lifespan of a mattress is about seven to 10 years. How long your mattress lasts depends on how often you sleep on it, if you rotate it and what it’s made of. All-foam mattresses tend to wear out a little fast because the foam can sag. The average lifespan of the average mattress is between seven and ten years. Although there are things you can do to extend the life of your bed:Clean regularly Rotate your mattress to avoid uneven wearAdd a mattress protector Use a mattress topper to change the firmness or feel of your bed
What is the best time to buy a mattress?
There is always some sort of mattress sale going on. The type of sale and size of discounts will vary depending on the time of year. You’ll see the biggest markdowns around major holidays like Labor Day, Memorial Day, Presidents Day, Black Friday and Christmas. And you'll likely be able to save by bundling your mattress with other products you may need, such as a bed frame or bedding.
What mattress is recommended by doctors?
Your sleeping habits and body type are essential to any mattress recommendation. There is no one mattress recommendation by doctors, but there are certifications to look for. For instance, mattresses like the Avocado Green and Plank Firm Luxe are endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association.
How do I choose the best mattress for my sleeping position?
Your sleeping position will determine how firm your mattress should be. Side sleepers sleep best on softer mattresses that offer enough pressure relief so they don’t develop pressure points on the shoulders, knees and hips. Stomach and back sleepers need a firmer mattress that keeps their spine in a neutral position throughout the night. If a mattress is too soft, you’ll wake up with back pain. Combination sleepers should choose based on where they spend the most time.
What type of mattress is best for people with allergies?
People with allergies benefit most from mattresses made with hypoallergenic materials, like latex foam beds. Latex foam is naturally hypoallergenic and antimicrobial, so mold and other allergens can’t grow on it. Alternatively, memory foam beds are a good choice for people with allergies.
How can I tell if a mattress is good for me without trying it in-store?
Buying your next bed online can seem like a risk. The best online mattresses offer trial periods and free returns to make sure you’re satisfied with your selection. Trials from brands range from around 90 days up to a full year to make your decision. If you’re unhappy, you can return it and get a refund. The best way to start shopping for your next bed is to consider your preferences, sleeping position and budget. That will help you narrow down the market to your best options.
How do mattress warranties work, and what should I look for?
Nearly all online mattress brands offer a warranty. The warranty duration will vary by brand, though the low side tends to be around ten years. Just because a mattress has a warranty doesn’t mean everything is covered under it. Warranties protect you against defects in the bed, like broken coils or split seams. Warranties do not cover normal wear and tear to your bed. Some brands, like Nest Bedding, offer unique programs like the lifetime renewal exchange, which allows you to replace old layers of foam.
Are more expensive mattresses always better?
No, expensive mattresses aren’t always better. Plenty of really affordable beds rival the quality and comfort of costly beds. More expensive beds often have extra bells and whistles like zoned support and cooling covers that budget choices don’t have.
How do I properly clean and maintain my mattress?
Changing your bedding regularly is the first step in keeping your bedroom clean. It won’t stop your bed from collecting stains, dead skin cells and dust mites. Properly cleaning your mattress includes spot cleaning, vacuuming and deep cleanings.
