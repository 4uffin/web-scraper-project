No one deserves a flat, saggy mattress -- not only is it uncomfortable, but it can also cause pain. There are plenty of better mattresses out there for those who are plus-size, promising you healthier sleep. However, you should also consider other factors before purchasing: Are you a side sleeper? Do you experience back pain? Or do you get too hot at night and want a cooling mattress to avoid overheating? I leveraged my extensive industry knowledge to handpick the best mattresses for heavier individuals, guaranteeing they deliver the comfort and support you need for a restorative night’s sleep.

What is the best mattress for heavy people overall?
The Big Fig mattress is an all-around supportive mattress for heavier body types. Jonathan Gomez/CNETThere’s no question that the Big Fig mattress is the best overall mattress for heavy people. It’s in the name -- Big Fig is short for “bigger figures.” With ultra-durable individually wrapped coils and layers of foam, the brand delivers on its promise to make a bed with heavy body types in mind. The Big Fig mattress has the highest reported weight rating, at 1,100 pounds, compared to most other beds in this category, which are only 1,000 pounds. When put to the test of CNET's Mattress Smasher 9000, we found that the Big Fig mattress has an objective firmness score of 6 out of 10, although the pillow-top mattresses tend to read a little softer than they actually are.Big Fig Mattresses

SCORE
Pros
Highest weight capacity of any bed
Extra-firm edge support
Brand runs good discounts
Responsive feel keeps you from feeling “stuck”
Cons
Too firm for some side sleepers
Overkill for people under 150 pounds
Not a budget choice
Big Fig is an exceptionally supportive mattress that falls on the firmer side of the scale. It’s a great choice for combo, back and stomach sleepers. Heavy sleepers will be pleased with the comfort and support.  Why we chose this bed: The Big Fig mattress is the best overall mattress for heavy people because it is supportive and durable. When I lie on the Big Fig mattress, it almost feels like the bed is pushing back; that’s how supportive it is. It’s also super responsive, which makes changing positions easy. I’d describe this bed as having a foam feel. Depending on your weight, you’ll sink into it at varying degrees, but it won’t feel like a memory foam bed. It feels more like the bed is propping you up.The Big Fig mattress is pretty firm, around a medium-firm to firm. The thing about firmness is that it’s subjective, depending on how much you weigh. Our MS9K delivered an objective score of six out of 10, although the programmed weight for the device is 160 lbs. If you weigh well over that, the bed will feel softer.Who should get this bed: This bed is ideal for most heavy sleepers, especially those who prefer a firmer mattress. Back, stomach and combination sleepers should feel supported by this bed. Who shouldn’t: Strict side sleepers might find the Big Fig too firm. The Helix Plus mattress is a more affordable option for heavy people looking for a slightly softer, neutral foam bed.  ... Show more

Allswell Brick
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great for back and stomach sleepers
Supportive hybrid construction
8 inches of coils
Cons
Not ideal for heavier side sleepers
Not the best motion isolation
Allswell is a well-loved brand by our team of CNET sleep experts. It's readily available from Walmart, and Allswell offers affordable hybrid mattresses (a twin starts at $194). If you're on a budget, you can't go wrong with the Allswell Brick -- the brand's firmest and most supportive option. Why we chose this bed: If you didn't already gather this from its name, the Allswell Brick mattress is very firm. It is 12 inches thick and features a quilted top, a thin layer of copper memory foam, high-density support foam and eight-inch-thick coils. The firmness level and the layer of coils make this Allswell bed extremely supportive for heavier weights -- meaning it will ensure the spine won't sag during the night. We know just how uncommon it is to find a firm hybrid bed for under $450, so this mattress is the ultimate pick for an affordable bed for heavy people. Who should get this bed: Our team found this bed to be around a medium-firm to firm, making it around an 8 out of 10 on our scale. The Brick mattress is ideal for stomach and back sleepers who need the most support from their bed. The bed suits heavier people and the firmness level keeps the spine neutrally aligned. This hybrid bed is super high value, making it great for someone on a tight budget.Who shouldn’t: I don't recommend this bed for side sleepers who are looking for hip and shoulder pressure relief. If you only sleep on your side, the Allswell Brick may be too firm.

Titan Plus
7.9

SCORE
Pros
Perfect for back and some stomach sleepers
Durable construction
Made in the USA
More affordable than others on the list
Cons
Too firm for side sleepers
If you’re looking for a firm bed with extra durability and back reinforcements, check out the Titan Plus mattress. It’s a great option for back and stomach sleepers but likely will be too firm for side sleepers.Why we chose this bed: When I lie down on the Titan bed, I instantly feel how firm it is. Despite having foam layers near the top, I don’t sink very far into this bed because of the supportive construction with 6-inch wrapped steel coils. The layers of foam and the quilted cover make sure you can’t feel the coils, although their support is definitely obvious. I would describe it as a firm, neutral foam feel; there is nothing surprising about it. It’s just comfortable.The Titan Plus mattress is best for back and some stomach sleepers. We found it to be around a medium firm on our scale. Of all the beds on this list, Titan is one of the most affordable, at $1,249 for a queen. Yes, that’s not what I would call a budget bed, but you have to understand that beds with such hefty constructions tend to cost more than all-foam options. Titan gives you a lot of bang for your buck.Who should get this bed: Heavy back and stomach sleepers who perfer firm, hybrid and neutral foam-feeling mattresses should enjoy the Titan Plus. It’s also a great choice for those on a stricter budget. Who shouldn’t: Strict side sleepers might not get enough pressure relief from this bed (or any very firm mattress). If couples want a bed with multiple firmness options and a pillow top, the Saatva Classic has a supportive and hefty construction. The firm option is best for heavy body types, but the luxury firm may work for some couples.   ... Show more

Best mattress for heavy couples
Helix Plus Luxe
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Thick gauge coils for added durability
Comfy pillow top
Zoned support
Everyone will like it
Cons
Potentially too firm for side sleepers
Expensive
The Helix Plus Luxe mattress is built for burly bodies. Fans of traditional pillow tops will like this bed, although it might be a little too firm for some strict side sleepers.Why we chose this bed: The Helix Plus Luxe is a great option for heavy couples because it balances comfort and support. The 1,000 TitanCore steel coils, which are thicker than what you normally would find in Helix beds, provide a lot of support. When you lie on it, you’ll feel the pushback of the thick-gauge coils but the cloud-like Tencel pillow top ensures plenty of comfort. I’d describe the overall feel of the bed as a traditional pillow-top feel, which I tend to really like. We rated the Helix Plus Luxe mattress as a medium-firm on our scale. So it’s not the firmest option, but I think it’s great for back and stomach sleepers who need support but don’t necessarily want to feel like they’re sleeping on a board. Heavier side sleepers or those who like firmer beds could also get away with it, although I don’t recommend it for side sleepers who want a lot of pressure relief. Who should get this bed: I would recommend this bed to sleepers who like pillow tops first and foremost. It’s also a generally agreeable bed. The Helix Plus Luxe is for couples looking for a firmness level to accommodate them both.   Who shouldn’t: I don’t recommend this bed for side sleepers who want a lot of pressure relief. Instead, the Leesa Plus Hybrid Mattress is another widely appealing bed that side sleepers or couples might enjoy more. It’s cheaper than the Helix Plus Luxe, at only $1,649 before sales.  ...

only one firmness option
The Saatva HD is a supportive pillow-top mattress that most people will like. It’s softer than most beds on this list so it’s a good option for side sleepers who want a medium-firm bed. It’s not plush but it’s not super firm, either.Why we chose this bed: The Saatva HD mattress has a responsive pillow-top feel that is generally appealing. Despite a memory foam layer, you won’t get the sink-in, body-conforming feel that foam beds give you. The Saatva HD is also one of the softer beds on this list. Beds for heavy people tend to skew firm. I wouldn’t consider the Saatva HD truly soft but we found it to be around a six or seven out of 10 on our scale. The Saatva HD was made for long-term support. With sturdy coils, a patented spinal zone technology for lumbar support and a five-zoned latex foam layer, this bed will last. I’d say that the Saatva HD is a safe choice because it’s the type of mattress that anyone is going to like. The only negative thing about this bed is that it’s significantly more expensive than other beds.Who should get this bed: This mattress is best for back, stomach, side and combination sleepers looking for a neutral-feeling, accommodating bed. Thanks to its durability and excellent support coils, we recommend this mattress for couples.  Who shouldn’t: The Saatva HD is not for those on a tight budget. Instead, if you're looking for a more affordable pillow-top bed, check out the Bear Star Hybrid bed. It’s $1,998 before sales. It has a coil layer that heavy sleepers need.  ... Show more

/10
SCORE
Pros
Supportive design
Good for back and stomach sleepers
Luxurious pillow top
Cons
Not for people on a tight budget
Not the most pressure-relieving bed
Pillow-top lovers won’t want to miss the WinkBed Plus. This supportive bed is great for back and stomach sleepers, although some side sleepers will want more pressure relief than this bed gives.Why we chose this bed: If you’ve read my reviews before, you know how much I love pillow tops. To me, they’re the epitome of classic comfort that isn’t going to surprise me. If that resonates with you, you’ll probably like the WinkBed Plus. It’s a premium bed that feels like it should be in a hotel with the super fluffy pillow top.Our MS9K rated it a 6.5 out of 10 and our hands-on experience testing was a medium-firm or seven. Since this bed is on the firmer side, it is very supportive and pushes up against your body. However, the more you weigh, the softer it will feel so it could be a good choice for heavy side sleepers or those who prefer a firmer bed. It’s definitely not the firmest bed on the list, and the fluffy pillow top has some pressure relief.Who should get this bed: Heavy sleepers who need a bed with a good balance of both comfort, pressure relief and support will enjoy the WinkBed Plus. It's a very accommodating bed that I recommend for heavy back and stomach sleepers. Who shouldn’t: The WinkBed Plus is not for true memory foam lovers or strict side sleepers. Instead, those sleepers might enjoy the pressure relief of the Nectar Classic Hybrid. It has a memory foam feel and a hybrid construction.  ... Show more

Best mattress for heavy side sleepers
Nolah Evolution Comfort Plus
8.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Thick gauge coils
Accommodating pillow-top feel
Enhanced edge support
Great for side sleepers
Cons
Only one firmness option
Expensive
Heavy side sleepers should take note of the Nolah Evolution Comfort Plus mattress. Not only is it super durable, but it also has a plush pillow top and foam layers for cushioning. However, it might be too soft for some back and stomach sleepers.Why we chose this bed: The Nolah Evolution Comfort Plus mattress looks almost identical to the Evolution Hybrid, although it was upgraded for heavy people. It’s the best bed for heavy side sleepers because of the pressure relief it offers. This is the softest bed on the list, with foam layers and a fluffy pillow top. The MS9K scored this bed a 5.14 out of 10, although heavy people will probably think it’s just a tad softer.This bed looks nice and feels high quality, like something you’d see in a fancy hotel. However, that means it will be a little expensive for some, at $2,499 before sales.Who should get this bed: If you’re a fan of a super fluffy, pillow-top feel, you’ll like the Nolah Comfort Evolution Plus. Side sleepers who want a bed with lots of pressure relief for their hips should love this bed. Who shouldn’t: This bed is not for side sleepers on a tight budget. Instead, I recommend the softest level of the Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid. It’s also a good option for heavy side sleepers, and it’s only $1,332 before sales.  ... Show more

Best memory foam mattress for heavy people
DreamCloud Premier Hybrid
8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Widely-appealing memory foam feel
Firmness makes it good for most sleepers
Year-long trial period
Available in an all-foam construction
Cons
All-foam construction might not be ideal for all types of heavy people
If you like the contouring feel of memory foam, the DreamCloud Premier hybrid is the bed for you. It’s a hybrid bed for support that’s great for just about any heavy sleeper.Why we chose this bed: Don’t be fooled by the pillow-top look; the DreamCloud Premier hybrid mattress has a responsive memory foam feel, thanks to the layers of memory foam. When I tested the DreamCloud Premier, I sunk in a little, giving some body-conforming bliss that only memory foam can provide. However, it’s not as dense as Tempur-Pedic. I’d say it’s more like a general memory foam that widely appeals to everyone -- even people like me who don’t love the memory foam feel.Our MS9K rated the DreamCloud Premier mattress as a 5.67 out of 10, which is close to what we found during hands-on testing. That makes it good for just about anyone, although heavy people will likely find it to be a flat medium. That means anyone can sleep on it if you don’t want an extremely soft or firm bed.Who should get this bed: The DreamCloud Premier is a good, happy medium for a lot of people. It isn’t extremely firm or soft. Heavy sleepers of all sleeping positions should find this bed comfortable, but I recommend the hybrid option for more support. Who shouldn’t: Heavy sleepers who prefer firmer, neutral foam over sink-in, dense memory foam won’t like this bed’s feel. Instead, heavy sleepers should check out the Brooklyn Bedding Signature in the firm option.  ... Show more

Best hybrid mattress for heavy people
Helix Plus
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Durable steel coils
Neutral comfort foam
Excellent edge support
Cooling upgrades available
Great value
Cons
Not truly budget
Want the most bang for your buck? The Helix Plus mattress is a supportive and durable hybrid that stomach and back sleepers will love. It might be a little firm for some side sleepers unless you like a slightly firmer bed.Why we chose this bed: The Helix Plus is one of those beds everyone will like. It has a neutral foam feel that doesn’t suck you in but is still comfortable. Because it has TitanCore steel coils and high-density foams, you get a lot of push-back and resistance when you lie on it. Unless you’re specifically looking for dense memory foam or the responsiveness of latex foam, you’ll like this bed.In terms of firmness, the MS9K rated the Helix Plus a 7.13 out of 10. While the top layer of comfort foam offers some pressure relief, it may be too firm for strict side sleepers. However, if you like a firmer bed as a side sleeper, this is a good choice.Helix Plus is the most affordable mattress for heavy people. While it’s not what I would consider cheap, the Helix Plus is one of the best values out there. Hybrid mattresses for heavy people tend to be more expensive because they feature hefty coils and denser foams, so you shouldn’t expect to pay all-foam pricing. Helix regularly runs sales on its beds so you’ll often get the Helix Plus mattress for $1,200 or less.Who should get this bed: This bed is ideal for back, stomach and combination sleepers. Firm bed lovers with a touch of comfort foam should find this bed comfortable and, best of all, easy on the wallet. Who shouldn’t: The Helix Plus isn’t for firm bed lovers. It has more of a medium to medium-firm firmness level, and it conforms to the body. Sleepers looking for a mattress that pushes up against them might enjoy the Titan Plus, instead. During sales, we've seen the bed drop below $1,000.  ... Show more

Best mattress for heavy people data
We all experience beds a little differently based on weight, preferences and sleeping positions. To cut through the subjectivity of mattress testing, our CNET Labs team built the Mattress Smasher 9000, a proprietary device we use to score and collect firmness objectively. Each bed we include in our lists is rated by the MS9K and then compared to one another. One caveat on this data: Our mattress smasher is programmed to exhibit force equal to that of a 160-pound person. So the scores don’t perfectly reflect how firm a mattress will be for someone who weighs more than that. Heavier people will experience beds to be a little softer. It’s not always a big difference, although the more you weigh, the softer it will be. How we test mattresses for heavy people
Our team of nine mattress experts has been doing this for years. We’ve tested and reviewed around three hundred mattresses and dozens of sleep accessories, from bedding to toppers to headphones for sleep. During that time, we’ve established a testing methodology that each mattress undergoes when it arrives at our Reno testing facility. We take a holistic approach to mattress testing, which means our team is involved to ensure we’re representing all types of people. Our team has a mix of genders, body types and sleeping positions.
CNET mattress expert Owen Poole tests motion isolation using a glass of water. Aly Lopez/CNETFirmnessWe rate and record two types of firmness: Subjective and objective. When I test firmness, I lie on the mattress in every sleeping position and note how it feels against my back, stomach and hips. Our whole team takes part in this process to ensure that the firmness rating is not based on one body type.
The Mattress Smasher 9000 objectively measures the firmness levels of mattresses. Dillon Lopez/CNETThe objective firmness level comes from our Mattress Smasher 9000. Not only is it impressively orange, but it can scientifically rate the firmness of a bed based on the force of a 160-pound person. We always make sure to test a bed ourselves before the MS9K gets a turn to ensure our experience is unbiased. Motion isolationMotion isolation is how well a bed dampens movement across the surface. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you sleep with another person or furry friend, a bed with poor motion isolation can keep you up at night.
Dillon Lopez/CNETTo test motion isolation, we do two things. First, I lie on a bed and close my eyes while a teammate moves around on the bed next to me. I do this from every sleeping position and rate how much movement I feel the whole time. Second, we perform the water test, which involves setting a glass of water on the edge of a bed and rolling toward it. The bed receives a lower motion isolation score if the water sloshes around or topples.Edge support
Dillon Lopez/CNETIf you’re like me and tend to sleep on the edge of the bed or have mobility limitations, then you know how important edge support is. To test the strength of the bed’s perimeter, we sit and lie on the edge and rate how much it caves. It doesn't have good edge support if it feels like we might roll off or the edge collapses under our weight.Many of our favorite beds, like Big Fig, have strong edge support, meaning you have access to the entire surface area of the bed to sleep.Temperature All of the beds that come through our lab are tested in a temperature-controlled room. Many brands claim their beds are cooling, but their performance doesn't back it up. We’re passionate about making sure a bed backs up its claims. We examine the bed's construction and rely on our first-hand experience with it to rate how cool it feels. What to consider when buying a mattress for heavy sleepers
Only you can decide which mattress for heavy people is right for you. However, these are the main factors that can help you narrow down your search.Firmness and sleeping positionI always recommend starting with firmness when looking for their next bed. Two important things to mention about firmness are that your weight and sleeping position largely influence your preference.How much you weigh will determine how you experience a mattress. A petite person will put minimal pressure on the bed, meaning the bed will feel firmer to them. A heavier person will put more pressure, so it will feel softer. The more you weigh, the softer it will feel. I’m not talking about huge differences, though it’s something to remember.The position you sleep in at night will also influence what feels comfortable.Side sleepers need a softer mattress with enough pressure relief to ensure they don’t develop pressure points at the shoulders, hips and knees.Back and stomach sleepers require a firmer mattress to ensure their spine stays at neutral alignment all night. Combination sleepers have the most flexibility in firmness. It’s best to choose your firmness based on the position where you spend the most time. Or aim for the middle of the firmness scale.Mattress typeHeavy people can sleep well on any type of bed, though if you want your bed to stand the test of time, I recommend you stick with a hybrid bed. The durable steel coils will ensure your bed gives you the support you need. They also tend to be more durable in the long run. Some all-foam beds can sag over time, so it’s best to avoid the potential for that entirely. That doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy memory foam; just make sure there is a coil base under the foam layers.Your budgetUnfortunately, the best mattresses for heavy people tend to be more expensive than other beds because of the upgraded construction. That doesn’t mean you’re doomed to spend $3,000. I just say this to prepare your expectations. The cheapest bed on this list specifically designed for heavy people is the Titan Plus at around $1,200, though that price can drop under $1,000.You can spend less and opt for a bed not designed for heavy people. Just make sure you choose a bed with a hybrid construction. Mattresses you should avoid
There’s nothing wrong with these beds, in fact, many of us hold them in high regard. That said, they aren’t going to be the best mattresses for heavy people, likely because of their construction. Bear Original: An affordable memory foam mattress, the Bear Original unfortunately doesn’t provide the support heavy people need in the long run.Lucid Gel Memory Foam: This is another bed with an all-foam construction that will not support you as you need it to.Cocoon Chill: While it’s a good budget cooling option, the Cocoon Chill mattress has an all-foam construction. Thankfully, there’s the Cocoon Chill Hybrid available. Dreamfoam Doze: If you’re looking for an ultra-budget option, Dreamfoam will appeal. Just make sure you avoid the Dreamfoam Doze, which is an all-foam bed. Dreamfoam also has Hybrid beds. Other mattresses we’ve tested
We at CNET have tested over 300 beds and dozens of sleep accessories. The following beds didn’t make our list when compared to our top picks, but one of these mattresses might still work for you.Avocado Green Mattress: This organic mattress is firm and supportive enough for larger bodies. It’s made with natural materials such as Dunlop latex, GOTS organic wool and cotton. We rated this bed a 7 out of 10 on our firmness scale with the optional pillow top. Without the pillow top, it is a 9 out of 10. Check out our Avocado Green Mattress review if this bed sounds appealing.Helix Plus Elite: This mattress is the top model in the Helix Plus lineup, made specifically for heavy sleepers. It is the most expensive of the collection and features 1,000 TitanCore steel coils and a zoned-support design. Read up on our Helix Plus Elite review for more information. Brooklyn Bedding CopperFlex Hybrid: The new CopperFlex Hybrid comes from Brooklyn Bedding. It is one of the most affordable extra-firm mattresses we have tested, making it a great option for heavier body types. We suggest the hybrid version which will cost you only $699 when on sale. Read our review of this CopperFlex mattress here. What we’re testing next

Best mattresses for heavy people FAQs
Do mattresses have a weight limit?
Yes, mattresses technically have weight limits. The average is around 500 pounds (250 pounds on each side). The limit comes from what the bed is made of. The best mattresses for heavy people carry a higher weight limit because they are made with durable materials like steel coils. The bed with the highest weight capacity is the Big Fig mattress, at 1,100 pounds.
What mattress types are best for heavier/larger sleepers?
Hybrid mattresses are the safest choice for heavier sleepers because of the individually wrapped coil or innerspring base. They’re more supportive and durable than all foam options. But don’t worry; the best hybrid mattresses also use layers of foam or pillow tops to ensure you don’t miss out on comfort.
Is a soft or firm mattress better for heavier or larger sleepers?
No firmness level is best for heavy people. How firm a mattress you should get depends primarily on your sleeping position. Side sleepers need a softer bed to avoid pressure points, while back and stomach sleepers need a firmer bed to keep their spine in a neutral position. Only you can decide how firm or soft you want your bed to be.
Is a memory foam mattress good for a heavy person?
Many heavy people love the contouring feelings of memory foam. That said, getting a hybrid bed with coils and foam layers is a good idea. It’s the best of both worlds.
How thick should a mattress be for a heavy person?
People who weigh over 230 lbs (104 kg) should not go for mattresses under 12 inches thick. 12 to 14 inches is the sweet spot for thickness. However, mattress thickness alone isn't what makes a mattress a good one for heavy sleepers: you also need an adequately thick and supportive core and high-quality, dense build material.
