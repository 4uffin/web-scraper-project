A mattress is a big investment. When shopping for a new mattress, you’ll want to consider a few factors, including your preferred sleep position. If you sleep on your side, a soft yet supportive mattress is the one you'll need. These will relieve pressure and keep joint pain at bay, all while maintaining proper spinal alignment. However, finding the perfect mattress can be tricky, which is why CNET's sleep experts have done the legwork to find the top options that provide ample support to help you get a good night's sleep.

Tips for sleeping comfortably on your side
A recent CNET survey found that 46% of US adults are willing to invest in a better bedroom setup to improve sleep quality. Our team has tested hundreds of beds from myriad brands, ranging from household names like Tempur-Pedic and Purple to unique brands such as Sonu and Airweave. So, whether you're a hot or heavy sleeper, on a strict budget or dealing with back or hip pain, there's a bed on this list for you.What's the best overall mattress for side sleepers?
We tested hundreds of beds from dozens of brands to find the best mattresses for side sleepers. Dillon Lopez/CNETAfter countless hours of testing over 300 beds, our team chose the Layla Hybrid as the best overall mattress for side sleepers. Thanks to its unique flippable design, it offers two sides with varying firmness levels -- a quality we rarely see among hybrid mattresses. Both lean on the softer side of the firmness scale, offering the pressure relief side sleepers need. It has an airy memory foam feel that's more responsive than traditional memory foam, so it's a nice accommodating middle ground in terms of feel.See at LaylaVideo: Best mattress for side sleepersWatch CNET senior video producer Owen Poole review the best mattress for side sleepers.Best mattresses for side sleepers in 2025

Best overall mattress for side sleepers
Layla Hybrid
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Dual-sided for two firmness options
Soft and airy responsive memory foam feel
Great for side and combination sleepers
Hybrid construction offers more support than all-foam
Cons
Not a true budget choice
May not be the best for heavier back or stomach sleepers
Why we chose the Layla Hybrid mattress: If you're a side sleeper unsure what firmness profile you need, Layla Hybrid could be the right bed for you, thanks to its dual-sided design. This unique, flippable mattress has a different firmness level on each side, and both are suitable for side sleepers. How it sleeps: Our one-of-a-kind Mattress Smasher 9000 device rated the Firm side of the Layla Hybrid a 5.3 out of 10 on the firmness scale and the Soft side a 3.1. This 13-inch-tall bed has a soft, airy memory foam feel that leans on the responsive side. It features a layer of long-lasting pocketed coils in the middle, increasing the support and durability of the mattress. On either side of this coil system are poly foam and copper gel-infused memory foam layers. Though the copper gel infused into the memory foam is intended to help keep you cooler, it sleeps more temperature-neutral than actually cooling.One of the main reasons we chose this mattress as the best overall for side sleepers is that you have two chances to get the firmness right for your personal preferences -- if one side feels too soft or firm, all you have to do is flip it over. This flippability also adds to the lifespan of your mattress.Overall, it's a comfortable and accommodating two-in-one mattress with a price that's hard to beat for the quality. A queen-size Layla Hybrid retails in that middle-tier price range for $1,699, but Layla frequently offers discounts that bring the price point down a couple of hundred dollars.   Runner-up: The Nest Bedding Sparrow is a responsive, pressure-relieving hybrid mattress with a pillow-top feel that sits between medium and medium-soft, making it perfect for side sleepers. At $2,132 for a queen, it's slightly more expensive, but it's worth noting that Nest Bedding offers solid discounts and superb company policies, such as a 365-night trial period and a lifetime renewal exchange.  ...

Best mattress for heavy side sleepers
Titan Plus Elite
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Heavy-duty construction supports up to 1,000 pounds
Micro-coils provide more pressure relief and motion isolation
Cooling cover helps with temperature regulation
Cons
Not a budget option
Might be too firm for light side sleepers
Why we chose the Titan Plus Elite mattress: We were immediately impressed by how supportive and luxurious this mattress feels. Specifically designed to hold up to 1,000 pounds, the new Titan Plus Elite by Brooklyn Bedding offers the perfect combination of support and cushioning for heavier side sleepers. To top it off, there’s a 2-inch plush pillow top with cooling fibers to help keep you cooler throughout the night.How it sleeps: This responsive bed has a slight hint of a memory foam feel due to a layer of thousands of individually wrapped micro-coils. These small coils increase the bed's motion isolation capabilities (which is great if you sleep with a partner) and enhance that cushioning sensation. Thanks to its heavy-duty coil system and high-density foams, you won't have to worry about sagging with this ultra-durable mattress. It has zoned support and pressure relief in the right places, which is crucial for side sleepers. It lands around a medium (perhaps a hair into medium-firm), ideal for heavy individuals and couples -- the heavier you are, the more you’ll sink into the mattress and the softer it usually feels.Though it has Titan's GlacioTex materials on the top, this mattress sleeps more temperature-neutral than actively cooling. It offers excellent edge support -- another feature to look for if you share the bed.At $2,398, it's not necessarily a budget option, but the brand frequently offers discounts that can bring the price for a queen down to $1,800, which we think is a steal for a bed this nice.Runner-up: The Saatva HD is another great choice designed to support heavier people. This high-end mattress has a super supportive innerspring system and Lumbar Zone technology to promote healthy spinal alignment. One downside is that this bed requires a particular Saatva HD Foundation, as it's not compatible with regular foundations or box springs. At $3,399, it's on the pricier end, but it is worth looking into if you're considering a premium mattress.  ... Show more

Best memory foam mattress for side sleepers
Nectar Luxe
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Fans of dense memory foam will appreciate the feel
Plenty of pressure relief
Some of the best policies in the game
Great price during Nectar's frequent sales
Cons
Too soft for back and stomach sleepers
Not for those looking for a neutral feel
Retails on the expensive side
Why we chose the Nectar Luxe mattress: The Nectar Luxe is one of the softest memory foam mattresses we've tested, particularly ideal for side sleepers. This 14-inch tall mattress offers a cozy, body-contouring sensation that memory foam lovers will appreciate. Thanks to its multiple layers of viscous foam, it has sound motion isolation, so you and your partner shouldn't bother each other when moving around at night.How it sleeps: The Nectar Luxe Memory Foam, part of Nectar Sleep's recently launched new line of beds, has a dense, slow-to-respond feel. However, it is responsive enough for combination sleepers to switch positions comfortably. This bed is medium to medium-soft, confirmed by the Mattress Smasher 9000's ranking of 3.4 out of 10 on the firmness scale.On top of the mattress is a sleek cover that's noticeably cool to the touch, which is nice if you tend to sleep hot. This cooling cover also has an antimicrobial finish, so it stays feeling fresh.The Nectar Luxe mattress comes in all-foam and hybrid options, both of which have plenty of pressure relief for side sleepers seeking that dense memory foam feel. We recommend opting for the hybrid version if you share a bed and both of you are on the heavy side, as it is more durable thanks to the strong coil system inside.“The Nectar mattresses are some of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. As a side sleeper, I prefer plush beds with lots of pressure relief for my joints, and this is it. I don't wake up sore as I have on other mattresses,” says Dillon Lopez, CNET senior video producer.Runner-up: The Nectar Premier is the brand's most popular pick. It's cheaper than the Luxe version, coming in at $949 after factoring in Nectar's frequent discounts. It's slightly firmer than the Nectar Luxe, making it great for combination sleepers who favor their sides.  ... Show more

Best soft mattress for side sleepers
Helix Sunset Luxe
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Hybrid construction is supportive for all body type
Soft and plush pillow top
Great pressure relief and edge support
Optional cooling cover upgrade
Cons
Super heavy sleepers may want a slightly firmer bed
Not suited for back or stomach sleepers
Why we chose the Helix Sunset Luxe mattress: The Helix Sunset Luxe is surprisingly soft yet offers a ton of support. This responsive hybrid mattress has a comfortable and plush pillow-top feel that most people like. Thanks to the soft and cradling comfort foam layers, its medium-soft firmness profile is ideal for side sleepers seeking pressure relief around the shoulders and hips.How it sleeps: The Helix Sunset Luxe has a plush pillow-top feel that's mostly neutral with a trace of memory foam -- it's like sinking into a cloud. We were impressed by how supportive it is despite feeling so soft. Its durable coil system has a specific Zoned Lumbar Support design intended to keep your spine neutrally aligned, which is a great feature to look for in a mattress if you have back issues. The heavy-duty pocketed coils provide plenty of support for all body types, including heavier sleepers.  The Tencel cover on the Helix Sunset Luxe is a breathable, hypoallergenic material that helps wick moisture away. However, it isn't truly cooling, so if you are a very hot sleeper, you may want to consider adding the optional cooling cover for an additional cost. While it's ideal for side sleepers, this mattress could also work for some combination sleepers who favor their sides. The bed's perimeter is reinforced with durable steel coils, creating solid edge support -- important for those sharing the bed with a partner, kids or pets. Helix frequently offers discounts that slash the prices way down, often taking the price for a queen from $2,399 to $1,899 or less, which we think is pretty good for a premium bed like the Helix Sunset Luxe.Runner-up: The Helix Moonlight Helix Sleeps offers multiple mattress lines with varying feels and firmness levels through its Core, Luxe and Elite collections.

Best mattress for side sleepers with shoulder or hip pain
Purple Mattress
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
GelFlex Grid provides support and pressure relief
Breathable materials are good for hot sleepers
Medium firmness level is great for side and combination sleepers
Cons
Not everyone will like the feel of the GelFlex Grid
Not as supportive for heavier sleepers
Why we chose the Purple Mattress: The original Purple Mattress is simultaneously soft and supportive, providing the pressure relief needed if you have hip or shoulder pain as a side sleeper. Its responsive GelFlex Grid comfort layer cradles those pressure points while supporting your back and spine. Not to mention, the breathable grid design helps you sleep cooler -- another perk if you're suffering from chronic pain.How it sleeps: Purple mattresses all incorporate this unique GelFlex Grid feature made of hyper-elastic polymer. This proprietary material is incredibly stretchy and durable, providing a soft surface that cradles and supports your curves. Shaped in a grid with thousands of individual air channels, it naturally sleeps cooler by allowing your body heat to escape. "One benefit of the GelFlex Grid is it does an excellent job of helping the mattress sleep temperature. Because the material has very little surface area, the bed has amazing airflow, which helps prevent heat buildup and it doesn't retain heat like some types of foam. I slept on a Purple Hybrid mattress for years, and I noticed this benefit a lot during the summer months," says Owen Poole, CNET senior video producer and mattress expert.Lying on the Purple Mattress, you can feel the grid beneath you more than most of the other more expensive Purple mattresses. Our experts rate the Purple Mattress medium on the firmness scale or around 5 out of 10. Its all-foam construction (meaning no coils) is best for sleepers on the lighter side, under 230 pounds. If you're heavier, we recommend checking out the Purple Restore Hybrid. Runner-up: The Nolah Signature Hybrid is a medium-soft mattress with a perforated AirFoam layer that cushions your shoulders and hips. It also has targeted support zones to help relieve tension in high-stress areas.   ... Show more

Best cooling mattress for side sleepers
Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Comes in multiple firmness options
Super impressive cooling technology
Great price point for the quality
Supportive hybrid design with pocketed coils
Cons
Optional cloud pillow top is an additional cost
Not for those looking for a memory foam feel
Why we chose the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe: The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe is a super cool bed -- literally. In addition to its exceptional cooling technology, this mattress comes in three firmness options, so you can choose the right one for you. It has a soft, neutral foam feel and a supportive hybrid design that works for all body types.How it sleeps: Many mattress brands claim their beds are cooling, but few actually are -- Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe being one of them (which is why it also took the crown as the best for hot sleepers on our top cooling mattresses list). I was impressed by how cool-to-the-touch its GlacioTex cover is, which truly helps you sleep cooler rather than just temperature neutral.This supportive hybrid design of the Aurora Luxe includes a high-density foam base, durable pocketed coils and Brooklyn Bedding's proprietary foam layers: Gel Swirl memory foam, Supreme Response comfort foam and CopperFlex.For strict side sleepers, we recommend opting for the Soft model. If you're on the heavier side or more of a combination sleeper, check out the medium firmness option. The firm version, which we think is more medium-firm, is best for stomach and back sleepers. Runner-up: If you're looking for another maximum cooling mattress and budget isn't a concern, check out the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze. At $5,599, it’s one of the more expensive beds we’ve tested. It comes in multiple firmness options, with soft being the best for side sleepers.Read more in our Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe review.   ... Show more

Best value mattress for side sleepers
Nolah Original
7.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lifetime warranty
Suitable for side and combination sleepers
Accommodating blended foam feel
Cons
May not be supportive enough for heavier people
$99 return fee
Only one firmness option
Why we chose the Nolah Original mattress: Though a queen-size Nolah Original 10" retails for $1,449, it's typically on sale for as low as $999 -- a smoking deal for the quality. This all-foam mattress has a unique yet accommodating mixed or blended foam feel. It has some sinking sensation like memory foam but is much more responsive and bouncy.How it sleeps: The Nolah Original has a simple design of three layers of various foams and a Tencel cover on top. The foams include Nolah's 8-inch SolidSleep foam foundation, 1 inch of AirFoam Ice and 1 inch of Zoned AirFoam Ice. The zoned layer is perforated around the shoulders to add pressure relief and softness for side sleepers, while it's firmer in the middle for lumbar support. If you're of average to heavy weight, you'll likely find this mattress to feel somewhere between medium to medium-soft, like most of our CNET sleep experts found. If you're lighter like me, this mattress may feel slightly firmer than that, around a 5 to 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale. We recommend a hybrid mattress if you are on the heavier side or weigh 230 pounds or more. The Nolah Original Hybrid is $300 more and offers a medium firmness profile and a neutral hybrid feel, another great option for heavy side sleepers.Runner-up: The Dreamfoam Hybrid mattress retails for $799 but is often a couple of hundred dollars cheaper during the brand's frequent sales. Thanks to its supportive comfort foams, it offers a soft neutral foam feel and an accommodating medium firmness level. This is another option for side and combination sleepers that offers impressive bang for your buck.For more discounts, check out our Best Mattress Deals.   ... Show more

Best mattress for side sleepers with back pain
Leesa Legend Chill
9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Dual coil layers support those with back pain
Foam layers provide plenty of pressure relief
Great motion isolation and edge support
Comfortable cool-to-the-touch cover
Cons
On the expensive side
Only available in one firmness level
Too soft for strict stomach or back sleepers
Why we chose the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid mattress: Side sleepers with back pain need a softer bed with enough support to keep the spine in healthy, neutral alignment. That's where the Leesa Legend Chill Hybrid mattress comes in. Its medium-soft to medium-firmness profile provides ample pressure relief for the shoulders, hips and knees and sufficiently supports the back and neck.How it sleeps: The Leesa Legend Chill has a dual coil system with zoned support and a micro-coil layer for increased motion isolation and enhanced pressure relief. It features a cushioning cool-to-the-touch quilted cover that can also help reduce pain by preventing overheating at night.In testing, we found this bed between medium-soft and medium, confirmed by our Mattress Smasher's rating of a 4 out of 10 on the firmness scale, which puts it right in the sweet spot for side sleepers and combination sleepers who favor their sides. It also has reinforced edge support, a huge plus if your partner is a bed hog. A queen-size retails for $2,949, which is expensive. Thankfully, Leesa often runs significant sales, bringing the price down by at least a few hundred. It's a luxurious mattress that's worth the money if it's in your budget and you're looking for a five-star hotel feel.Runner-up: The Casper Dream Max is another great option for side sleepers with back pain, thanks to its medium-soft profile and zoned support for spinal alignment. It's also expensive, but it will be a lot less if you catch Casper during one of its frequent sales.    ... Show more

Best organic mattress for side sleepers
Amerisleep Organica Plush
8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Non-toxic; made with natural and organic materials
Incredible pressure relief for side sleepers
Durable, hybrid design
Cons
On the expensive side
Not recommended for back or stomach sleepers
Why we chose the Amerisleep Organica Plush mattress: The Organica Plush by Amerisleep is likely the softest latex bed our sleep experts have ever tested. This bed comes in a 13-inch medium pillow-top option or a taller, plusher 16-inch box-top version for $1,250 more. Our Mattress Smasher 9000 ranked the Amerisleep Organica Plush a 2.5 out of 10 on the firmness scale, making it ideal for side sleepers seeking maximum pressure relief.  How it sleeps: Made of eco-friendly materials such as organic wool, cotton and natural Talalay latex, it's completely non-toxic and free of fiberglass. Though the natural Talalay latex is more breathable than other types of foam, this bed will still sleep on the warmer side, given the wool and cotton cover.When I say this bed is soft, I mean it. You'll sink far into the mattress, but not in the body-conforming way that dense memory foam does -- you sink because the layers are simply that soft. Though it's still responsive, switching positions is a little harder since you're further into the layers than your typical bed.Runner-up: If you want something a little bit firmer, check out the WinkBed EcoCloud. This mattress is also made with natural materials and has a similar latex foam feel. It's a teeny bit firmer than the Organica Plush but is still soft compared to most other latex mattresses.  ...

Best unique mattress for side sleepers
Sonu Sleep System
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Unique design is perfect for side sleepers
Great choice for couples
Soft and accommodating neutral foam feel
Has multiple firmness options
Cons
Requires Sonu’s custom sheets
Might be too soft for back and stomach sleepers
Expensive
Why we chose the Sonu Sleep mattress: Designed explicitly for strict side sleepers, the Sonu Sleep System is one of the most unique beds we've ever tested. It has a patented "comfort channel" in the top third of the mattress, a large cutout designed to keep your arm comfortable while lying on your side. How it sleeps: Sonu has three firmness options: Push, Hybrid and Firm. Our sleep experts found the Hybrid model to be a flat medium on the firmness scale, and it has a soft and accommodating neutral foam feel -- it's not sinking like dense memory foam, yet not overly bouncy, either. This mattress is an excellent choice for couples who sleep primarily on their sides. With your arm and shoulder nestled in the cutout, they won't fall asleep or go numb as they might on regular mattresses. It makes cuddling a whole lot more comfortable. This bed also offers solid edge support and sound motion isolation, two great features for couples to look for in a bed. There are a few downsides to this bed's unique construction, one of which is that Sonu's custom-made fitted sheet is required to accommodate the comfort channel. Sonu's sheets are 100% long staple cotton; no other materials are currently offered. So if you strongly prefer a certain material for your sheets, this mattress may not be for you. Given its firmness level and the comfort channel cutout, we don't recommend this mattress for back sleepers.  ... Show more

Add to compareFirmness data for the best mattresses for side sleepers
At CNET, our sleep experts use subjective and objective methods to test mattress firmness to thoroughly assess how it feels and who it's best for. Subjectively, we use our extensive experience and expertise to test and analyze a bed's construction, describing where it lands on the firmness scale to the best of our ability. How firm a mattress feels can differ drastically from person to person, so we describe firmness from the perspective of varying body types, weights, genders and sleeping positions.
The Mattress Smasher 9000 getting ready to smash a bed and provide us with an objective firmness score. Aly Lopez/CNETOur Mattress Smasher 9000 is a super cool, proprietary CNET device that objectively assesses mattress firmness. This unique machine presses down into the mattress with a predetermined amount of force (to simulate whatever body weight we want to test), calculating how far its arm goes into the mattress to determine its firmness on a scale of 1 to 10. We always test a new mattress subjectively first, then follow it up with the Mattress Smasher to see how well it backs up our claims.From softest to firmest, here are the objective firmness levels gathered when testing the best mattresses for side sleepers with our Mattress Smasher 9000.
How we tested the best mattresses for side sleepers
Our sleep experts have been testing mattresses, bedding and sleep technology for years, dedicating thousands of hours to honing our craft of honestly and thoroughly reviewing beds and sleep-related products. We’ve tested well over 300 beds from dozens of brands like Casper, Helix, Nectar, Purple, Leesa and many more. Our bed testers have varying body weights and types, heights, genders and sleep preferences, allowing us to provide an overarching assessment of each mattress from multiple viewpoints. We take pride in our mattress testing methodology, which includes analyzing characteristics such as firmness, feel, temperature regulation, motion isolation, edge support and special features.FirmnessOne of the primary characteristics we look for when selecting the best mattresses for side sleepers is firmness, which implies the amount of pressure relief the bed offers. During our testing process, our experts of varying weights and body types take turns lying on the bed in each sleeping position to determine how well they'll cradle our primary pressure points -- mainly shoulders, hips and knees. When lying on your side, the mattress must offer some "give" around these areas. If a mattress is too firm, it can push back on these pressure points too much and cause soreness, pain and even numbness. As I mentioned, firmness is subjective and varies from person to person -- the driving force behind the creation of our Mattress Smasher 9000. With the mattress placed on the platform, we activate the device, which presses its arm into the middle of the bed. Our corresponding software then provides the objective firmness level on a scale of 1 to 10, with being the softest and 10 the firmest. We never recommend a mattress with a high firmness score for side sleepers. The sweet spot for side sleepers is typically around medium-soft, give or take some, depending on your weight, body type and personal preferences.FeelThe feel of a mattress is another important element we analyze and review. Influenced by the types of foams and coils used in its construction, the feel of a bed is exactly how it sounds -- what does it feel like when you lie on it? Is it bouncy and responsive? Is it easy to switch positions? Or does the dense memory foam conform around your body and hold your shape for a while? Does the mattress have a soft, plush pillow top feel, or is it more neutral? Are the coils or zoned support noticeable? We do our best to describe precisely what it feels like to lie on each bed to help you determine if it's right for you without having to test them all yourself.
When possible, we remove the mattress cover and cut open the fire sock to examine the layers inside. Owen Poole/CNETIn determining the best feel for side sleepers, we look for beds with a softer and more plush sensation that cradles your curves and offers plenty of pressure relief for your hips and shoulders. Read more: Why The Foam in Your Mattress MattersTemperature regulationEach individual's preferences, body type and even health conditions can influence how hot or cold a mattress feels. We’ve also found that mattress brands exaggerate the cooling capabilities of their beds. This is why we detail how hot or cool the mattress sleeps during our testing process so that you have a more accurate understanding of how it feels to lie on it. Does the mattress sincerely feel cool to the touch and give a satisfying chilling sensation for hot sleepers? Or will it sleep more temperature-natural? Do the materials retain body heat and keep you warmer? Other external factors affect what the temperature of a bed feels like to you, such as bedroom environment, the bedding you use and the pajamas you sleep in. At our mattress facility, we test beds in temperature-controlled rooms without sheets or bedding to analyze their construction and materials and explain how they affect the overall temperature of the bed.Motion isolationMotion isolation is a simple term for how well the mattress deadens movement across its surface. A bed with good motion isolation is essential for light sleepers or those sharing the mattress with a partner or pets. We test a bed's motion isolation capabilities by having one expert lie on the bed while another flops around and switches positions. Does the person lying feel the movement through the mattress, or is it subtle and less noticeable? For the second method, we set a glass of water on the edges, rolling toward and away to see if the glass falls or the liquid sloshes over. Typically, beds with dense memory foam perform the best in this category. More responsive mattresses tend to have worse motion isolation.Edge support
CNET's Dillon Payne tests edge support by lying and pressing down on the edges. Dillon Lopez/CNETEdge support refers to the strength of the bed's perimeter, another important factor to keep in mind if you sleep with a partner or pets or tend to sleep on the edge. Testing the edge support involves analyzing how well the mattress holds its shape and structure when we sit and lie on the perimeter. Does it cave in and give the sensation we'll roll off, or is it super sturdy and supportive? We also push down on the edges with our fists to observe how much it compresses under pressure. Many mattress brands add reinforcements around the edges -- whether coils or firmer foams -- to enhance the edge support. Having solid edge supports helps to create a stable and consistent sleeping surface across the entirety of the mattress.Special featuresMattress brands often offer beds with special features, such as covers with cooling technology for hot sleepers or zoned support specifically for people with back issues like sciatica. We always test and review these additional characteristics to determine if they live up to the brands' claims and to let you know which sleeper type would benefit most.Learn more: How We Test Mattresses What to consider when buying a mattress for side sleepers
The mattress characteristics that side sleepers should look for are different from those of strict stomach or back sleepers. Here are the main things to keep in mind if you favor your side when you sleep.FirmnessSoft mattresses are typically more pressure-relieving than firm beds. With firm mattresses, the surface pushes back into your pressure points, which can cause pain and soreness and may even throw off the alignment of your spine. Softer beds are better for side sleepers (and combination sleepers who favor their sides) as they offer more contouring and cushioning beneath pressure points like your hips and shoulders.Body typeIn most cases, the heavier you are, the softer a mattress feels because you'll typically sink deeper into the layers than a lighter individual, and vice versa. It's worth mentioning that this is not always the case, as it largely depends on the bed's construction, the materials used and the placement of its layers of foam and coils. Heavier sleepers over 230 pounds can usually get away with side sleeping on a firmer bed because it'll feel a tad softer than for average or lightweight individuals. The reverse applies to lighter individuals under 150 pounds, who may want to opt for a true soft to medium-soft mattress so it won't feel too firm.Mattress typeThe design and construction of your mattress directly influence how it feels and how long it lasts. Hybrid beds with coils tend to last longer than all-foam mattresses. Knowing what you want your bed to feel like will help narrow down your options. Do you like the sinking, contouring feel of dense memory foam that's super slow to respond? Or do you like a bouncier mattress that's more responsive and easier to switch positions? A soft and plush pillow top that feels like floating on a cloud? Or a mixed, neutral feel somewhere in the middle?Sleeping positionWe review four main sleeping positions on each mattress: back, stomach, side and combination. If you’re a strict side sleeper, a softer mattress is going to be key as firm mattresses are going to be too uncomfortable and unforgiving.Back and stomach sleepers should opt for firmer mattresses that provide enough support to keep your spine neutrally aligned through the night. If the mattress is too soft while you’re lying on your back or stomach, you’re more likely to experience discomfort and even pain from the curvature of your spine and neck.
Back sleepers typically need a firmer mattress to keep the spine in a healthy, neutral alignment. Jon Gomez/CNETCombination sleepers switch positions throughout the night. We typically recommend a middle-of-the-road medium (leaning into medium-firm at times) for combination sleepers, but it will depend on which position you spend the majority of your time in. Health concernsIf you suffer from pain -- whether back, hip or joint -- it's important to keep this at the forefront while mattress shopping. Side sleepers with back pain should seek a bed that lands around a medium and offers a balance of support and pressure relief. If you have hip or shoulder pain, a softer mattress can help take some pressure off those sensitive joints.
Soft beds are typically best for side sleepers because they provide more contour underneath shoulder and hip pressure points.
What we're testing next
At our expansive mattress testing facility in Reno, Nevada, our team of sleep experts is constantly reviewing new beds from all sorts of brands. We’re currently testing brand-new mattresses from brands including:Stearns & FosterAmerisleepPuffyTuft & NeedleBeautyrest
A glimpse into one of the large storage spaces at our testing facility.
Aly Lopez/CNET Mattresses you should avoid
If you’re a strict side sleeper, we recommend steering clear of mattresses on the medium-firm to firm end of the scale. Beds that fall under this category include:Saatva Classic: This mattress comes in three firmness levels, all of which we deem too firm for strict side sleepers. The plush soft model of the Saatva Classic could be doable for heavier side sleepers or combination sleepers who favor their sides, but we wouldn’t recommend the luxury firm or firm models.Plank by Brooklyn Bedding: As the name implies, Plank is extremely firm. Plank Firm and Plank Firm Luxe are flippable, one side being medium-firm and the other a true firm -- both sides much too firm for side sleepers. These mattresses are better for back and stomach sleepers who need substantial spinal support. DreamCloud Hybrid: The Mattress Smasher 9000 scored the DreamCloud Hybrid a 7.13 out of 10 on the firmness scale, confirming our consensus that it’s between medium-firm and firm.  Tips for sleeping comfortably on your side
The numbers vary, but studies have shown that anywhere from 50% to 75% of people sleep on their sides. Aside from being comfortable, this sleeping position has certain health benefits, such as reducing the risk of sleep apnea and improving gut functioning. Side sleeping is also recommended during pregnancy (many providers specifically recommend the left side) as it can help improve blood flow to the organs and keep pressure off the liver. Having the right mattress is key, as side sleeping can have adverse effects if you're lying on one that's ill-suited for it.There are a few things you can do to ensure that you're sleeping soundly and comfortably on your side, including:Use the right pillowThe pillow you use can drastically affect your overall sleep experience. Side sleepers typically need taller, loftier pillows that adequately support the head and align the spine and neck. A pillow that's too flat will cause your head and neck to bend down and out of alignment with your spine, which can cause pain and discomfort.Read more: Best Pillows for Side Sleepers in 2025Add more cushioningUsing more pillows for extra padding is another way to increase comfort while sleeping on your side. Try keeping a soft and fluffy pillow between your knees to help relieve pressure on your back and promote better spinal alignment. You can also keep a pillow under your armpit if you have shoulder pain and need some additional pressure relief.Consider a mattress topperIf your mattress is too firm but you're not in a position to spend the money on a whole new bed, consider adding a mattress topper to your sleep setup. Doing so can change the firmness of your current bed, so side sleepers should look for a soft and plush topper.
Mattresses for side sleepers FAQs
What type of mattress is best for side sleepers?
Memory foam is one of the best mattress types for side sleepers because it allows you to sink in, hugging your body’s curves and helping to relieve pressure points. According to our testing, the top memory foam mattress for side sleepers is the Nectar Luxe. A soft hybrid mattress with a plush pillow top is another great option for side sleepers who don’t like that dense memory foam sensation and would rather feel like they’re more “on top” of the bed.
Should side sleepers have a soft or firm mattress?
I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- side sleepers should opt for a soft to medium mattress. Mattresses in this range offer enough give to alleviate pressure around the hip and shoulder joints and usually retain enough support to keep your spine aligned while lying on your side.
Are firm mattresses bad for side sleepers?
Firm mattresses aren't always bad for side sleepers. But they aren't typically great for side sleepers, especially those under 150 pounds. If your mattress is too firm, it won't offer the give and cushioning your shoulders and hips need. This can disrupt your sleep by causing you to wake up with pain and even numbness or tingling from insufficient blood flow. It ultimately comes down to personal preference, but most side sleepers do best with softer options or more medium-firm mattresses, like our top pick, the Layla Hybrid.
Is a memory foam or hybrid mattress better for side sleepers?
Memory foam and hybrid mattresses are both good for side sleepers. The best option will depend on your preferences and needs. Our top overall pick for side sleepers, the Layla Hybrid, is a hybrid mattress. Side sleepers tend to do well with hybrid mattresses because they offer a nice balance of pressure relief and support, but those who like an even softer mattress may prefer all foam options.
Can a mattress topper help side sleepers?
If you're a side sleeper in need of a new sleeping setup but aren't in a position to spend money on a whole new bed, a soft and plush mattress topper is a reasonable investment to consider. It will change the feel of your current bed and may help relieve pressure from your joints.
