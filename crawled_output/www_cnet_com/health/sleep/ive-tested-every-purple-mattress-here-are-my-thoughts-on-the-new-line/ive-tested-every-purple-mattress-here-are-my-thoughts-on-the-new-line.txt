Final verdict on the Purple mattress lineup
When it comes to mattresses, you really can't go wrong when you buy one from Purple. It's one of the most popular and unique brands on the internet, offering a completely different take on a comfy sleeping experience. Over the past six years, I’ve tested over 175 online beds, including every version of Purple.I’m checking out five of Purple’s best mattresses from their three collections. I’ll go over how they look, how they feel and their prices. All this data can help you figure out which one might be right for you.Watch CNET video producer Owen Poole review Purple mattresses. Read more: Our Expert Best Mattress RecommendationsFirst impressionsSome of the newer Purple mattresses offer a very different look from what the brand previously put out. The dark gray and purple edges on the Restore and Rejuvenate models give them a luxurious look with a more traditional mattress feel, a plus for those who aren't wild about Purple's trademark gel-like feel.But the Essential collection has the Purple beds that most shoppers expect from the brand: that unique feel and stretchy grid. Between the newer models and those that carry the flagship design, as well as a great range of prices, you've got more choices from Purple than ever.Let's dive into five of Purple's best mattresses: the flagship Purple, Restore Hybrid, RestorePremier Hybrid, Rejuvenate and RejevenatePlus. Purple mattresses' feel and firmnessFirst up: How Purple mattresses feelPurple: The construction of the flagship Purple mattress gives it a distinct feel, thanks to the GelFlex Grid. Since this material is uncommon in most mattresses, it offers a new, also comfy, sleeping sensation. Restore Hybrid: It feels similar to the flagship Purple mattress but offers a bit more bounce from the coils, which should also help to support heavier people a bit more in the long run.RestorePremier Hybrid: The extra inch of GelFlex Grid gives it an even more distinct feel that the flagship Purple mattress. It’s easily one of the most “purply” mattresses we’ve tested.Rejuvenate: It has a less distinctive feel and more of a responsive, pillow-top sensation. If you’ve ever slept on a luxurious hotel bed, it’s similar to that, but with a subtle hint of Purple’s unique comfort blended in.RejuvenatePlus: Similar to the Rejuvenate mattress but with a lot more pressure relief. It adds more comfort elements and feels more plush, while still having that responsive pillow-top feel.
Getting a feel for the Purple Restore mattress; the top layer feels like a gel toy or Dr. Scholl's insole.  Jonathan Gomez/CNETSecond up: Purple mattresses' firmnessPurple: The flagship Purple should be right around a flat medium for the average-sized person. If you're on the heavier side, you may find it softer, while more petite sleepers will perceive it as firmer. However, it should be just fine for all sleeper types.Restore Hybrid: Its soft version is around a medium, while the firm version is closer to a proper medium-firm. If you’re a strict back or stomach sleeper seeking extra support, the firm option is worth checking out. RestorePremier Hybrid: The soft model is around a medium-soft, while the firm version sits between a medium and a medium-firm. If you're a primary side-sleeper interested in getting pressure relief for your shoulders and hips, the soft model could be for you.Rejuvenate: It's right around a medium-firm, working fine for all sleeper types, with a bit more support for back and stomach sleeping.RejuvenatePlus: I'd say it's about a medium. It's a solid option for all sleeper types, even side-sleepers who want a bit more pressure relief.

Purple mattress composition: Each model's makeup Purple mattress
The Purple mattress is roughly 10 inches thick and has three foam layers.You've got dense foam on the bottom as the mattress's main support layer.Next, there’s a transition layer of neutral foam that adds pressure relief and serves as a buffer between the bed’s sleeping surface and the denser foam base underneath.Rather than foam on top, it has a trademark material called the GelFlex Grid. This is a stretchy and responsive polymer that's laid out in a grid format to offers a nice balance of support and pressure relief. Picture a giant Dr. Scholl's insole, but instead of in your shoe, it's in your bed.The GelFlex Grid is surrounded by a foam border to give it enhanced edge support, and Purple's SoftFlex cover wraps everything up.Worth noting: Every one of Purple's mattress models feature the GelFlex Grid material somewhere, either as the primary comfort layer or as a transition layer, but I'll get into that later in this review.Purple Restore Hybrid
We tested the Purple Restore mattress and found it's accommodating for a wide range of sleeper types.  Jonathan Gomez/CNETThe Restore Hybrid mattress is similar to the flagship Purple mattress since it uses the same primary comfort and transition layers. The biggest difference between them comes down to their support layers. Instead of dense foam, the Restore Hybrid has pocketed coils on the bottom for a more enhanced and targeted support system. This makes it more supportive for bigger body types.Above those coils, it also uses a neutral transition layer to add more pressure relief to the mattress.Like the Purple mattress, the top comfort layer is also that GelFlex Grid material – the brand's "secret sauce."This layer is also surrounded by a foam border to provide the mattress with solid edge support, and it's wrapped up with the brand's SoftFlex cover, which includes an antimicrobial finish.Purple RestorePremier Hybrid
Jonathan Gomez/CNETThis mattress sits at the top of Purple's Premium Collection. Its construction mirrors the Restore Hybrid, with two main additions. First, the foam transition layer of the bed sits within the coils instead of on top, almost like it's baked in, offering more motion isolation and edge support benefits.Second, there's more of that signature Purple touch. You get three inches of the GelFlex on the RestorePremier, while the Purple Mattress and Restore Hybrid offer sleepers just two inches. That means "goodbye" to any roll-off sensation. If edge support is key for you, look no further.Purple Rejuvenate
Jonathan Gomez/CNETPurple’s Luxe collection showcases the brand’s latest designs, offering more luxurious, pillow-top mattress feels that combine premium comfort with that distinct, signature Purple feel. The Rejuvenate is the entry-level model within this collection.It's around 15 inches thick and uses pocketed coils on the bottom for support, which feature a zoned support design to help keep your back properly aligned while resting.Next there's a transition layer made from a more neutral foam.Above that, there's the GelFlex Grid surrounded by an edge support foam border.And just beneath the bed's quilted cover, you've got the primary dual comfort layers of the mattress.Worth noting: Since the GelFlex Grid is positioned deeper within the mattress rather than right on top, it gives the mattress a more traditional pillow-top feel compared to other models in the brand's lineup.Purple RejuvenatePlus
Jonathan Gomez/CNETIf you thought the Rejuvenate was impressive, the upgrades only get better from here. The RejuvenatePlus is one of Purple's top-tier options. It's reflective of the Rejuvenate in terms of its overall design, but even thicker and more pressure-relieving. All the added comfort elements in its pillow top make it one of the most accommodating Purple beds to date. And if you're looking for an ultra-luxurious mattress, this one certainly checks the box. Purple mattress performanceIf you sleep with a partner, some other considerations come into play: How well does the bed deaden motion? How sturdy are the edges? Does it sleep hot or cold? Let's take a look. Motion isolationThe GelFlex Grid effectively deadens cross-mattress movement. If you push down on one side, the motion shouldn't reverberate to the other side. Similar to a dense memory foam bed, all Purple's mattresses work well for light sleepers.Edge supportPurple mattresses also have solid edge support. On most of the newer models, there's a foam border which surrounds the GelFlex Grid, helping to strengthen the edges. Even though hybrid beds usually have better edge support than all-foam ones, I don't see anyone falling off these beds anytime soon.Temperature All of the Purple mattresses we've explored in this review sleep temperature neutral, but not necessarily for the same reason. The Rejuvenate and RejuvenatePlus mattresses have cooling covers to help with sleeping temperature, while the other mattresses offer ample airflow via the design of the GelFlex Grid on top. Since there's not much surface area when it comes to Purple's grid format, air travels more freely through that layer than through your average comfort foam.See more: Best cooling mattressDurabilityThe Purple Hybrid models, aka the Restore and Rejuvenate lines, are more supportive and durable than the original Purple mattress because of the steel coils within their foundation layers. Hybrid mattresses last about three to five more years than all-foam mattresses.Off-gassingYour Purple mattress might have a funky smell when you unbox it, but that's completely normal. This is called off-gassing, and it happens because the bed has been compressed for a long time in plastic. The smell should dissipate after a couple days.Who is a Purple mattress ideal for?Sleeping positions
Jonathan Gomez/CNETSide Sleepers: Most side sleepers prefer softer options to provide pressure relief to their hips and shoulders. I think the Essential and Premium collections have the most accommodating mattresses for side sleeping, since they feature that body-conforming GelFlex Grid as their main comfort layers.  Stomach and Back Sleepers: If you sleep on your back or stomach, chances are you'll want a firmer bed. That being said, the GelFlex Grid is unique in that it offers in equal measures pressure relief and support. I'd recommend almost any of the Purple beds to these sleeper types, especially the Rejuvenate. But these sleepers should stay away from extremely soft models like the Purple PlusCombo Sleepers: I'm personally a combo sleeper, meaning I'm constantly rolling between positions at night. The GelFlex Grid is highly adaptive for combination sleeping. Its immediate response time makes switching from your back to your side to your stomach effortless.Body typeThe original Purple mattress is best for people under 230 pounds, while the hybrid Purple mattresses better accommodate all body weights. Heavier people could get by on the original Purple mattress, but the Premium and Luxe collections will offer more support.Purple mattress pricing Compare the Purple mattresses by price
Mattress Queen pricePurple
$1,499Restore Hybrid $2,399RestorePremier Hybrid $3,699Rejuvenate $5,495RejuvenatePlus $6,495
A queen-size Purple goes for around $1,400, but the brand usually offers discounts that bring it closer to the $1,000 range. This is one of the more affordable options from Purple.It's around $2,300 for a queen-size Purple Restore, so start saving up for those support coils. It may be worth it if you're a bit heavier. This is Purple's most affordable hybrid bed.The Purple RestorePremier queen-size retails for around $3,500, which is quite a bit to spend on a mattress. But it's a quality Purple product with the most amount of that uniquely "Purple" feel.There's no getting around it, the Luxe collection is expensive. The entry-level Rejuvenate queen-size runs $5,500, and the two other mattresses go up from there. They could be worth it if you're looking for a luxury product.Worth noting: Pricing for online beds often changes, but Purple mainly offers cash discounts around major holidays.  Purple mattress policiesWhen you're in the market for an online bed, it's important to know the details about shipping, returns, trial periods and warranties.100-night sleep trial10-year warrantyFree shipping and returnsYou have time to test the bed out at home before you're stuck with it. If you decide it's not right for you within that timeframe, you can return it for a full refund. If you decide to keep your new Purple mattress after that trial period, you're backed by a nice warranty.Final verdict on the Purple mattress lineupSo when it comes down to it, which bed from Purple is right for you?Purple: As the most affordable option among the ones I've discussed, this model will likely appeal to most buyers. It offers a budget-friendly price while retaining the signature Purple feel that fans love. Plus, its design is ideal for average-sized sleepers, making it a solid all-around choice.Purple mattress
