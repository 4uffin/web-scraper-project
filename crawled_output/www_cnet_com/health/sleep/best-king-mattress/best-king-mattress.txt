SCORE
Pros
Can suit all sleeping positions thanks to its firmness options
Hybrid construction supports all body types
Often on sale for well under $1,500
Free shipping and limited lifetime warranty
Cons
The optional pillow top is an extra $400
Not for those wanting dense memory foam
The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid has been a longtime favorite among our sleep team at CNET. It suits all sleeping positions and has a neutral foam feel that most sleepers enjoy. It comes in three firmness options (soft, medium and firm), so you can find the right one for you. Why we chose this bed: The Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid is great if you want an accommodating, supportive and durable mattress. “Out of all the beds I’ve tested that have multiple firmness options, this is also one of the most affordable -- discounts can bring this as low as $1,200 for a king. However, the bed never sacrifices comfort or value,” says Caroline Igo, CNET sleep editor.It's 12.25 inches tall and made of high-quality foams and durable steel springs, offering a bit more airflow than all-foam mattresses. There's an optional cloud pillow top cover that makes the bed feel noticeably cooler, so I think it's worth looking into if you're a hot sleeper. This bed is cushioning yet responsive, which made it easy for me to move around and switch positions while testing it. Who should get this bed: Given the firmness options, this bed works for any sleeper type. If you're a side sleeper, opt for the soft model. The medium model is on the softer side but accommodates all sleeper types, especially combination. The firm model is medium-firm or around 7 out of 10, which is best for back and stomach sleepers. Who shouldn’t: This bed isn’t for you if you want a dense, sinking memory foam feel. If you’re a super hot sleeper, check out the Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe. It's one of the coolest mattresses we've ever tested (literally).  ... Show more

Best king-size memory foam mattress
Nectar Premier
Pros
Medium firmness is great for combination sleepers and couples
Dense memory foam for those who like that hugging feel
Nectar offers a forever warranty and 365-night trial period
Cons
Not for those needing a super soft or firm bed
High retail price of $2,682 for a king (but is often on sale for much less)
If you're looking for a mattress with a body-hugging sensation that won’t make you feel totally stuck in the layers, check out the Nectar Premier. This bed comes in hybrid and all-foam constructions, both offering a contouring feel that you'll love if you like the feel of memory foam.Why we chose this bed: If you share the bed, the Nectar Premier's excellent motion isolation capabilities should keep you and your partner from waking each other up as you move throughout the night.“Nectar Premier might be the most comfortable mattress I've ever slept on. As a side sleeper, I like plush beds with lots of pressure relief for my joints, and this is it. I didn't wake up sore as I have on other beds, and I love the dense memory foam feel,” says Dillon Lopez, CNET senior video producer and mattress expert.Although it has that body-hugging memory foam feel, I found this mattress to be slightly more responsive than traditionally viscous memory foam, which makes it easier to switch positions -- that's important to me as a combination sleeper. It's topped with a breathable cooling cover that we find more temperature-neutral than actively cooling.Who should get this bed: Nectar Premier's medium firmness level -- confirmed by our Mattress Smasher score of 4.9 out of 10 -- makes it ideal for combination sleepers. Heavier couples or individuals should opt for the more supportive and durable hybrid version over the all-foam.Who shouldn't: If you're a side sleeper wanting a softer bed or one with more cooling features, check out Nectar Luxe. For back sleepers needing something firmer (or cheaper), consider the Nectar Classic mattress.  ... Show more

Best firm king-size mattress
Plank Firm Luxe
7.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Ideal for back and stomach sleepers
At $1,500 after discounts, offers great value for a king-size
Two firmness options thanks to flippability
Extremely supportive and durable
Cons
Not for side sleepers or those who want a softer mattress
Not for those who want a memory foam feel
If you are a back or stomach sleeper looking for a responsive and firm bed with ample spinal support, check out the Plank Firm Luxe by Brooklyn Bedding. After factoring in the brand's frequent discounts, you can get a king for $1,500 -- an excellent value for a bed like this.Why we chose this bed: Endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association, this bed's flippable design offers two firmness profiles in one: a firm and extra firm side. Our Mattress Smasher rated the extra firm side a 9.5 out of 10, making it one of the firmest mattresses we've tested.  This 13-inch-tall mattress has a neutral, flat, firm foam feel on both sides -- I didn't sink into the layers at all, instead lying more on top. It includes high-density foam layers and a 6-inch layer of individually wrapped coils, adding support and durability, especially for heavier bodies."For anyone seeking an ultra-firm mattress, this is a great option. All three beds in the Plank lineup are not crazy expensive, especially given their specialized design being ultra-firm and flippable," says Owen Poole, CNET executive producer and mattress expert.Who should get this bed: Consider the Plank Firm Luxe if you're a back or stomach sleeper seeking the most support possible and the least amount of give from a mattress. It's also great if you aren't sure exactly how firm you want your bed, since it's dual-sided.Who shouldn't: If you're a side or combination sleeper, you'll want a softer, more pressure-relieving surface for your shoulders and hips.   ...

Best king-size mattress for couples
Nest Bedding Sparrow
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Split firmness options for the king and Cal king sizes
Great for couples who can't decide on a firmness level
Excellent policies, including a lifetime renewal exchange
Durable hybrid construction with CertiPur-US certified foams
Cons
On the expensive side, retailing for $2,452
Not for those wanting memory foam
Thanks to its dual firmness capabilities and lifetime renewal exchange program, the Sparrow Signature Hybrid from Nest Bedding is our favorite option for couples.Why we chose this bed: Each side of the bed can have a different firmness level for partners with varying sleep positions and preferences. This unique feature is only available for the king and California king options.If you and your partner are lucky and prefer the same firmness level, it's available in plush, medium and firm. Our mattress experts found the medium model to be on the softer side, confirmed by our Mattress Smasher's score of 3.75 out of 10 on the firmness scale. This makes it better suited for side and combination sleepers. The "firm" option sleeps more like medium-firm, which we recommend for back and stomach sleepers.The Sparrow Signature Hybrid mattress has an extremely comfortable and responsive pillow-top feel. Nest Bedding also offers some of the best company policies we've seen, including a 365-night trial period, free returns and a lifetime renewal exchange program. This program allows you to exchange the bed's top comfort layer to increase the lifespan of your mattress or change the feel and firmness if it's not working for you. Who should get this bed: Partners who can't agree on a firmness level can each choose their own with the king-size Nest Bedding Sparrow mattress. It has a comfortable pillow-top feel that most sleepers will really enjoy.Who shouldn't: This bed is not for you if you want that sinking sensation offered by dense memory foam. It's also not for really hot sleepers who need cooling technology.  ... Show more

Best king-size mattress for heavy people
Big Fig
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Extremely durable, supportive and long-lasting
Solid price point during sales ($1,699 for a king)
Excellent choice for heavier back and stomach sleepers
Cons
Too firm for strict side sleepers
Might not be necessary for petite individuals or couples
Big Fig is an independent online mattress brand that crafts beds specifically for those with bigger bodies. A king retails for $2,099 but is frequently on sale for less. Right now, it's available for $1,699, which is a solid price for a high-quality, durable bed like this.Why we chose this bed: Heavier individuals and couples need a supportive and durable mattress, and Big Fig's heavy-duty coils and high-density foams are designed to support up to 1,100 pounds (or 550 pounds per sleeper).How firm a mattress feels can vary depending on your weight. Our team collectively agreed that Big Fig lands between medium-firm and firm. The heavier you are, the more you'll sink into the layers, which may make it feel slightly softer. As a lighter individual, I don't sink into the mattress much, which makes it feel super supportive. This 13-inch-tall hybrid mattress is responsive and has excellent edge support, so I didn't feel like I would fall off when lying near the edge. Because it's on the firmer side, there's not a ton of pressure relief, so we wouldn't recommend it for strict side sleepers; instead, its construction makes it ideal for back and stomach sleepers.Who should get this bed: Given its durable design with high-density foams and individually wrapped coils, Big Fig is great for heavier couples or individuals who want a supportive, long-lasting mattress that won't sag.Who shouldn't: Side sleepers will want something more pressure-relieving. Big Fig's supportive construction may be slightly overkill for petite or lightweight sleepers.  ... Show more

Best affordable king-size mattress
Allswell
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
One of the most affordable hybrid beds on the market at $467 for a king
Medium firmness can accommodate most sleeper types
Supportive design for all body types
Cons
A little too firm for side sleepers
No cooling technology for hot sleepers
Here at CNET, we love Allswell for being so wallet-friendly. Quality king-size mattresses under $500 are extremely hard to come by, which is why the Allswell Luxe takes the crown as the best affordable king bed.Why we chose this bed: Available at Walmart, this hybrid bed-in-a-box offers insane bang for your buck. This 12" thick mattress has a layer of individually wrapped coils, which helps isolate motion, so you shouldn't feel your partner moving around too much. It has a soft, neutral feel that we enjoy. Though it has some memory foam, the Allswell Luxe mattress responds quicker to pressure than traditional dense memory foam, helping you switch positions throughout the night.Our experts feel it lands around medium, making it ideal for combination sleepers and couples who need a middle-of-the-road firmness level. Thanks to its supportive hybrid construction, it's also suitable for all body types.Who should get this bed: If you're a combination sleeper balling on a budget, the medium version of the Allswell Luxe is the way to go. Opt for the extra firm model if you want more spinal support as a back or stomach sleeper.Who shouldn't: Side sleepers should opt for a softer bed. If you need something even cheaper, check out the Allswell 10" Hybrid mattress.  ... Show more

Best king-size mattress for back pain
Saatva Rx
9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Noticeable zoned support and pressure relief
Unique features like foam-topped coils and micro coils
Designed specifically to relieve back pain
Suits most sleeping positions and all body types
Cons
Expensive; a king retails for $3,999
Only one firmness option
Your mattress can make a huge difference if you have chronic back pain -- enter the Saatva Rx. Specifically designed to alleviate pain from health conditions like scoliosis, sciatica and arthritis, it has noticeable zoned support and pressure relief in all the right places.Why we chose this bed: I could immediately feel the zoned support of the Saatva Rx when testing this mattress. It has a comfortable pillow-top feel with a hint of memory foam, so it's cushioning and plush yet still responsive. It offers good pressure relief for your joints and is an excellent choice for combination sleepers with back pain. At 6.1 out of 10, the Mattress Smasher scored this bed slightly firmer than we expected, but it is still in that accommodating medium range.This luxurious mattress has foam-tipped coils, an extra layer of flexible 1" micro-coils and gel memory foam lumbar support. These help keep your spine in neutral alignment and will adjust to your body's curves and movements. It eliminates unwanted pressure points while providing ample support.At $3,999 for a king, this is certainly not a budget-friendly option. However, if you're living with back pain and want to try this premium bed, Saatva offers discounts around holidays that will knock the price down. The brand also offers a 365-night trial period with a $99 fee if you need to return or exchange your mattress.Who should get this bed: The Saatva Rx is an excellent choice if you deal with chronic back or joint pain and have the budget.Who shouldn't: If you're looking for something cheaper, the Saatva Classic mattress is a nice alternative that comes in three firmness options.  ...

Best king-size mattress for side sleepers
Layla Hybrid
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Flippable design allows for two firmness levels in one bed
Great pick for side sleepers who want a plush, light and airy feel
Suitable for all body types
Cons
Heavy back and stomach sleepers will likely think it's too soft
Layla Sleep frequently appears on our CNET best lists for good reason. Its Layla Hybrid mattress is unlike most other hybrid mattresses in that it's flippable, giving you two firmness options to choose from.Why we chose this bed: Our proprietary Mattress Smasher rated the firmer side 5.3 out of 10, while the other is softer, at 3.1 out of 10. We feel that both firmness levels offer pressure relief for our shoulders and hips, working well for side sleepers -- it really just depends on how soft you want it to be.Our team describes the Layla Hybrid's feel as an airy, responsive memory foam. It still provides some sinking, contouring sensation but less than the typical denser, more viscous memory foam. The soft side is perfect for side sleepers seeking that plush, pressure-relieving feel.Although Layla calls the flip side "firm," we think it's more of a medium to medium-firm. It will provide a little more support than the soft side while offering pressure relief, making it a great choice for combination or heavy side sleepers who want a soft yet supportive mattress.How is this mattress flippable? In the middle of the Layla Hybrid is a row of individually wrapped coils with varying layers of foam on either side, including copper-infused memory foam intended to help regulate body temperature.Who should get this bed: "The Layla Hybrid is definitely worth your consideration if you're in the market for a double-sided mattress with an airy memory foam feel that's backed by great policies," says JD Christison, CNET supervising producer and sleep expert.Who shouldn't: If you don't care about coils and are looking for a more traditional memory foam feel, check out the Layla Memory Foam mattress.  ...

Best cheap memory foam king-sized mattress on Amazon
Rolanstar
Pros
Three height options
Very affordable at only $140 for a king
Made with CertiPur-US certified foams
Responsive feel, so you don’t feel stuck when you lie on it
Cons
Won’t give you the support a hybrid bed can
No cooling technology for hot sleepers
One firmness option
King mattresses are expensive, so many people rule them out as an option. However, several cheap beds on Amazon, like the Rolanstar, make it possible for budget shoppers.Why we like this bed: Honestly, the Rolanstar mattress surprised us. For only $140 for a king, it’s pretty cheap, but it didn’t feel cheap like some of the other budget beds we’ve tested. It has an all-foam construction with decent motion isolation, which is good for couples who tend to wake each other up at night. When we tested it, we found it to have a responsive memory foam feel. So, it has the slow, sinking sensation that cradles your body like many people want, but it snaps back a lot faster. I like my memory foam to lean on the responsive side because it doesn’t take effort to roll around and flip positions at night.Who should get it: The Rolanstar mattress is ideal for people who want a memory foam mattress for cheap. It’s a medium to medium-firm profile, so it’s well-suited for combo sleepers on a budget. It’s also available in three height options, so you can choose what works best for you.Who shouldn’t: If you’re looking for a hybrid bed with a base of coils for durability and support, this isn’t the bed for you. I wouldn’t recommend it for heavier people or anyone looking for a bed that will stand the test of time. Sometimes, memory foam can sag without the coil base, so you run that risk. I recommend budget hybrid shoppers go for something like the Siena Hybrid mattress on Amazon.  ... Show more

Best king-size mattress firmness data
Here at CNET, we test mattress firmness in subjective and objective ways to thoroughly assess how it feels and who it's best for. Subjectively, we use our experience and expertise to test and analyze a bed's construction, describing where it lands on the firmness scale to the best of our ability. How a mattress feels to me may differ drastically from how it feels to you, which is why we describe firmness from the perspective of varying body types and sleeping positions.
The Mattress Smasher 9000 getting ready to smash a bed and provide us with an objective firmness score. Aly Lopez/CNETThe Mattress Smasher 9000 is a proprietary CNET device that objectively assesses mattress firmness. This unique machine presses down into the mattress with a predetermined amount of force (to simulate whatever body weight we are testing), calculating how far its arm goes into the mattress to determine its firmness on a scale of 1 to 10.The extra firm side of the Plank Firm Luxe is the firmest bed on our best king-size mattress list, at a whopping 9.5 out of 10. The soft side of the flippable Layla Hybrid bed is the softest, at 3.1.
How we test king-size mattresses
Our sleep experts have been testing mattresses, bedding and accessories for years (a few have been testing for up to eight years). At this point, we've tested over 300 mattresses from dozens of brands, from bigwigs like Purple and Tempur-Pedic to more niche companies like Sonu and Airweave. Our team is comprised of bed testers with varying body weights and types, heights, genders and sleep preferences, which helps us provide an overarching assessment of each mattress from a multitude of viewpoints. Many mattresses are tested for long periods, ranging from a month or two up to five years. We test king-size mattresses just like we would any other bed. When a new mattress arrives at our testing facility, it undergoes rigorous, hands-on testing by each of our experts. We analyze specific characteristics, including firmness, feel, temperature, motion isolation, edge support and other special features the mattress may have.FirmnessFirmness is rated numerically on a scale of 1 (the softest) to 10 (the firmest), and we use industry terms such as soft or medium-firm to describe it. Our entire team takes turns assessing and ranking the firmness of each mattress, which allows us to make suggestions about which sleeping position and body type it best suits. After subjectively analyzing the firmness, we let our one-of-a-kind Mattress Smasher 9000 do its thing and give us an objective firmness score.
A close-up of the Mattress Smasher 9000 in action. Aly Lopez/CNETFeelAnother subjective element we review is the feel of a mattress, separate from its firmness. Does it feel springy and responsive when lying on it? Is it easy to switch positions? Or does the dense memory foam conform around our bodies and hold our shape for a while? Does the mattress have a soft, plush pillow top feel, or is it more neutral? Can we feel any coils or zoned support? We do our best to describe exactly what it feels like to lie on each bed to help you determine if it's right for you without having to test them all yourself.Read more: Why the Foam in Your Mattress MattersTemperatureTemperature can be tricky to review when considering each sleeper's personal preferences and the fact that many mattress brands exaggerate their beds' cooling capabilities. When testing and reviewing mattresses, we detail how hot or cool the mattress sleeps. Many external factors come into play here (such as climate and environment, bedding, pajamas, etc.), so we test the beds in temperature-controlled rooms without sheets or bedding. Using our extensive knowledge and experience, we analyze its construction and materials and explain how they affect the temperature.Motion isolation
Testing the motion isolation of the WinkBed mattress with a glass of water. Dillon Lopez/CNETMotion isolation is a term we use to describe how well the mattress deadens movement across its surface. It's an especially important feature for light sleepers or those sharing the bed with a partner or pets. We test its motion isolation capabilities by having one expert lie on the bed while another flops around and switches positions. The second method is by setting a glass of water on the edge, rolling toward and away from it to see if the glass tips or falls over.Edge supportEdge support is typically not as important for king-size mattresses as it is for smaller sizes such as queen or twin. Regardless, testing the edge support allows us to assess how well it holds its structure and support around the perimeter. We sit and lie on the edge to see how the bed responds. Does it cave in and give the sensation that we'll roll off, or is it sturdy and supportive? We also push down on the edges with our fists to observe how much the edge compresses under pressure.Special featuresSome brands include special features in their mattresses, such as cooling covers for hot sleepers or zoned support for those with back pain. We test and review these additional characteristics and determine which type of sleeper would benefit the most. What to consider when buying a king-size mattress
The mattress market is massive, and determining the best bed for you is no simple task. To help narrow down your search for the best king-size mattress, here are a few key considerations to keep in mind.Sleeping position and firmnessOne of the first things you should know is how firm you want your mattress to be. Your sleeping position plays a large part in determining this. The firmness scale ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 being the firmest. A bed on the high end of the range, such as the Plank Firm Luxe, will feel extremely supportive and "hard" -- you won't sink into it much. Typically, this is best for strict back and stomach sleepers as it will help keep your spine and neck neutrally aligned. On the flip side, a softer mattress has more cushioning, and you will sink into it more than a firmer mattress. That's why softer mattresses are generally recommended for side sleepers who need pressure relief around the shoulders and hips.A bed in the medium firmness range can accommodate most sleeping positions, including combination sleepers who move around throughout the night. If you aren't sure what you prefer, here's how to find your personal Goldilocks bed firmness.Body and mattress typeLike humans, mattresses come in all sizes and types, from all-foam beds to hybrid mattresses with coils and foam. Knowing the right mattress type for you depends on how you want it to feel. Do you like the feel of viscous, hugging memory foam that conforms around your body as you sink into it? Or do you prefer to lie more "on top" of a bed with a neutral foam feel? Do you like soft and plush pillow-top covers? It's preferential, and knowing this will help you eliminate beds in your search for the best king-size mattress.A bed's firmness and feel can be subjective based on body type and weight. The more you weigh, the further into the bed’s layers you’ll sink and the softer it may feel. Conversely, the lighter you are, the more you’ll lie on top of the mattress, which can make it feel firmer. and the construction of the mattress matters here. All-foam beds typically have less support and durability than hybrid beds with coils and foam. We recommend heavier individuals and couples look for hybrid mattresses as they're generally more durable and tend to last longer. If you're a heavier person looking for a memory foam feel, don't worry -- there are tons of great hybrid beds with dense memory foam layers on top. What we're testing next
A glimpse into one of the rooms at our mattress testing facility.
Aly Lopez/CNETAt our large warehouse in Reno, Nevada, the mattress testing never stops. We are constantly receiving and reviewing new mattresses and updated beds from tons of different brands. Some of the brands we’re currently testing new beds from include:Tuft & NeedleStearns & FosterBeautyrestPuffyNectar Sleep King-size mattress types

King-size mattress FAQs
How big are king mattresses?
A king-size mattress measures 76 inches wide by 80 inches long -- the same length as a queen-size mattress but 16 inches wider.
What brand of king-size mattresses is considered the best?
Considering there are usually two sleepers on a king-size mattress, the best king bed should typically have durable coils, solid motion isolation capabilities and a breathable or cooling cover. After extensive testing, we chose Brooklyn Bedding's Signature Hybrid as the best overall king-size mattress. Other brands that we also like are WinkBed, Nectar, Layla and Casper.
How big should my bedroom be for a king-size mattress?
A king-size bed is 76 inches wide by 80 inches long, or 6.33 feet wide by 6.66 feet long. It’s recommended that your bedroom be at least 12 by 12 feet to comfortably fit such a large bed.
Who is a king-size mattress best for?
A king-size mattress is a great option for couples who want more sleeping space or those sharing the bed with kids or pets.
What's the difference between a king and California king mattress?
At 72 inches wide by 84 inches long, California kings are not as wide as kings. Instead, they have more space at the head and foot of the bed. This is ideal for taller individuals or those who have animals that will sleep at your feet.
What is the difference between a king and a split king mattress?
A split king is a king-size mattress made up of two twin beds placed side-by-side. Both a traditional king-size mattress and a split king are 76 inches wide by 80 inches long. Couples sometimes opt for a split king mattress setup to reduce motion transfer between the two sides of the bed or when each person has significantly different mattress preferences (such as firmness, support needs, etc).
What is the average life of a king-size mattress?
The average lifespan of a king-size mattress is between seven and 10 years, but it depends on the bed's construction and how well you take care of it. High-quality hybrid mattresses tend to last the longest, as their support system of steel innerspring coils won't break down as fast as an all-foam bed. Latex foam typically lasts longer than memory foam, and high-density foams will last longer than cheaper, low-density foams. Using mattress protectors and regularly rotating your mattress (if its design allows) can extend the life of your bed. Learn more about the 12 ways to make your mattress last longer.
