How we tested the best travel pillows
Video: Unboxing the travel pillows
Best overall travel pillow
Honorable mentions
Two of our CNET sleep experts tested and reviewed 11 travel pillows.
Aly Lopez/CNETThis summer, sleep is achievable even when you're miles from home. Whether you're flying, taking a train or enjoying a road trip, a good travel pillow allows you to arrive at your destination feeling refreshed. The right travel pillow will also provide crucial neck support and prevent your head from moving around, improving your chances of getting decent sleep while traveling. This isn't just about comfort -- proper sleep during travel helps prevent jet lag on long journeys and keeps you in good health when you're in a new environment. Our expert-tested recommendations will help you find the perfect travel companion for restful journeys.How we tested the best travel pillows
CNET sleep experts JD Christison and Aly Lopez tested over a dozen travel pillows. Wesley Ott/CNETCNET senior video producer and sleep expert JD Christison and I conducted hands-on (and heads-on) tests of all the travel pillows in this best list, including our honorable mentions. The main characteristics we analyzed were portability, adjustability, materials or construction, additional features (such as washability) and price. We unpacked the travel pillows and discussed our initial thoughts on each one. We then put them to the test by wearing them in the car while traveling on bumpy and windy roads to see if they could keep us comfortable and supported. We each took turns testing the pillows by sitting in various positions and wearing them in different ways as the pillow functionalities allowed. We also tested them individually on various road trips, flights and train rides throughout the year.Our selections for this list were based on various characteristics depending on your potential needs and preferences, such as the best affordable, multipurpose, adjustable and inflatable travel pillows. Here are the best travel pillows to help you get some Zzzs on your next trip.Video: Unboxing the travel pillowsWatch us unbox and give our first impressions of the travel pillows. Best overall travel pillowAfter testing and reviewing over a dozen travel pillows, we chose Travelrest’s Nest Ultimate Memory Foam Travel Pillow as the best overall, thanks to its affordable pricing, quality materials and highly comfortable, traditional design. It has a machine-washable cover that's easy to put on and take off, which is an important feature to look for if you want to keep your travel pillow fresh and clean.

Travelrest Nest Ultimate Memory Foam
Best overall travel pillow
$40 at Amazon
$40 at Walmart
JD and I immediately enjoyed the feel and fit of Travelrest's Nest Ultimate Memory Foam, which offers a traditional travel pillow shape and design. Its high-quality memory foam conformed nicely to our necks and shoulders, and the microfiber cover is super soft and cozy. It comfortably supported our heads without feeling overbearing.This pillow's textured backing helps hold it in place, which worked well in our testing. The Travelrest Nest pillow easily squishes down to a quarter of its full size to fit in the small carrying pouch. It's easy to travel with and keep clean in the bag. The cover is removable and machine washable, another trait we recommend looking for in a travel pillow.It has a velcro strap in the front, but this pillow is not as adjustable as some of the other pillows we tested. It's a one-size-fits-all pillow, so it may be a little big for individuals with smaller frames. At $40, this is an average price for travel pillows of this quality.Pros:Comfortable contouring memory foamMachine washable microfiber coverNon-slip material on the backCons:Only one sizeNot adjustableReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: One-year limited warrantyWashability: Machine-washable cover

AirComfy Ease Inflatable Travel Pillow
Best affordable travel pillow
$20 at Amazon
The AirComfy Ease Inflatable travel pillow is small but mighty. It's even smaller in its carrying bag, complete with a convenient carabiner to clip onto your luggage. It has a unique bowtie shape with an elastic band that allows you to attach it to the headrest on your seat to keep it in place. You can also place it behind your back if you need lumbar support.At $24, this is one of the most affordable travel pillows we've seen with this level of quality and functionality. The size isn't adjustable, but you can alter the firmness by adding more or less air as you blow it up, which only takes a few breaths to fill up completely. JD and I were surprised by how lightweight yet durable it felt, and we agreed that it seemed like it would hold up for many trips.It's worth noting that you may be limited in where you can use it. For example, if you're in the middle seat on a flight, you'd only be able to put it behind you with your head upright (you wouldn't be able to rest your head to the side). The soft velvet pillowcase is removable and machine-washable, which is a nice touch.Pros:Budget-friendlyStays in place on the headrestCan also be used for lumbar supportCons:Won't hold your neck perfectly in placeReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: N/AWashability: Machine-washable pillowcase
$20 at Amazon
Aly Lopez/CNET
Trtl Travel Pillow
Best adjustable travel pillow
$60 at Amazon
The Trtl Travel Pillow is lightweight and thin, folding up small and packing nicely into the accompanying waterproof bag. It has a unique ergonomic design that differs from the other brands we tested. This is not your typical U-shaped travel pillow. The Trtl has an internal support piece that you place against your neck and jaw on one side, wrap the soft, hypoallergenic fabric like a scarf and secure it with the Velcro piece. The Velcro is impressively sticky, which we look for to ensure that the product will be long-lasting.It's also machine washable and fast-drying; all you have to do is remove the plastic insert first. While initially testing the Trtl pillow during a long car ride, it took me a minute to figure out how to wrap it comfortably, but I eventually forgot I was wearing it because I found it comfortable. My head felt supported without the claustrophobic feeling I've experienced with bulkier travel pillows.While JD and I are very different heights, we both found the pillow adjustable enough to fit comfortably around our necks. Trtl also offers the Trtl Pillow Plus, which is height-adjustable with a twist toggle and designed specifically for various heights, from petite to tall. The brand also has a cooling travel pillow with more breathable and thermoregulating materials for those who run hot. Retailing for $60, the Trtl Travel Pillows are more expensive, but we think it could be worth it.Pros:Super soft and lightweightPacks small; easy to travel withAdjustable supportCons:Have to take it off and move it around to switch sidesGets a little warm after a whileDoes not provide full 360 supportReturn policy: 100-day trial periodWarranty: N/AWashability: Machine-washable fabric
$60 at Amazon
Aly Lopez/CNET
Hest Pro Travel Pillow
Best multipurpose travel pillow
$89 at Hest
The Hest Pro Travel Pillow is versatile and multifunctional -- I've used it while taking a catnap at the airport, sleeping on the plane and camping outside. It comes zipped in a protective carrying case, and the first time I opened it, I was flabbergasted by how large the unfolded pillow was. It's cushioning enough for getting shuteye at the airport during a layover or delay, and I found it comfortable and cozy while camping. Fully stuffed, it's a little too large for my liking when wrapped and clipped around my neck (especially while wearing over-ear headphones); instead, I like to use the extended mode as a body pillow on the plane while lying against the window (which you won't be able to do if you're in the middle or aisle seat -- unless you can rest it on a friendly neighbor). This pillow has a soft yet supportive feel thanks to its shredded memory foam and polyester blend. You can adjust the thickness by unzipping and removing some of the filling -- which I would do if I were using it solely in the neck pillow mode.My least favorite part of camping is shoving the tent and sleeping bags back into their super small stuff sacks, so I was not looking forward to putting the Hest Travel Pillow away at first. However, I was pleasantly surprised (and relieved) to find that it's super easy to squish back into its travel case.Pros:Versatile with three different “modes”Fits in a compact carrying caseInside filling is adjustableSoft and cushioning feelCons:On the expensive sideDoesn’t come with a clip or carabiner for attachingReturn policy: 100 daysWarranty: 365-night standard warrantyWashability: Machine washable cover
$89 at Hest
Aly Lopez/CNET
Bcozzy Neck Pillow
Best everyday travel pillow
$45 at Amazon
Bcozzy is a highly adjustable travel pillow with a flat back that doesn't push your head or neck forward like other thicker pillows might. It can be worn multiple ways, and we found it comfortable in any sleeping position. When wrapped around like a traditional travel pillow, it provides double support for the chin, keeping your neck aligned and preventing your head from falling forward. If you want to rest your head to the side, you can fold this moldable pillow in half and place it on your shoulder. Fellow CNET sleep expert Owen Poole even uses this pillow while working at this desk throughout the day.Bcozzy offers multiple sizes and super soft and cozy options for kids. JD found the XL worked well for him, and Large fits me better. It easily smushes into the accompanying carrying pouch, making it easy to travel with and keep clean. To top it off, the Bcozzy neck pillow is completely machine-washable without taking the cover off. The brand recommends putting it inside a pillowcase, washing it in a cold, gentle cycle and air drying.Pros:Versatile and adaptableEntire pillow is machine washableSuper soft fabricVarious sizes and kids optionsCons:On the expensive sideVelcro is not very stickyReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: N/AWashability: Machine washable
$45 at Amazon
Aly Lopez/CNET
Travelrest: All-In-One Ultimate Travel Pillow
Best inflatable travel pillow
$40 at Travelrest
The All-In-One Ultimate Travel Pillow by Travelrest was the best inflatable travel pillow we tested. Inflatable pillows have innate travel advantages, such as deflating and packing up super small. They're also great for adjusting the firmness by controlling how much air you put into them.The Travelrest All-In-One pillow has memory foam inserts, giving it an extra oomph of comfort and support. Since it goes around your body like a sling or messenger bag and rests on a shoulder, you don't even need a seatback to use it. You can comfortably rest your head while sitting in the middle or aisle seats of an airplane without having anything to lean against.One downside is having to blow it up on the plane while sitting in tight quarters with strangers and moving it around to the opposite shoulder if you want to rest your head the other way. On the plus side, it takes little effort to inflate -- we found that approximately three or four easy puffs will do the trick. Its luxury velour cover is soft and comfortable, removable and machine washable. For $40, we think this is a great value. Travelrest has a similar version without the velvet cover for $10 less.Pros:Deflates and packs small Soft, velvety coverAllows you to rest your head to the sideCons:You have to blow it up manuallyTake out memory foam inserts to wash itReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: One-year limited warrantyWashability: Machine-washable cover

Ostrichpillow Original Napping Pillow
Best unique travel pillow
$99 at Ostrich Pillow
$99 at Amazon
Ostrichpillow's Original Napping Pillow quickly became JD's favorite. This unique pillow may make you look like an alien or a weird bug, but don't fret -- the sleep you get while wearing it is worth any strange looks you might receive in public. Unlike the other travel pillows we tested, this fully encapsulating pillow blocks light and noise, creating a cozy cocoon for your whole head.This pillow can be used to catch some Zzzs anytime and anywhere, not just while traveling. The materials are incredibly soft, and the inside has extra microbead filling -- it's truly the ideal environment for taking a nap. We did notice that it becomes a little warm after a while, so if you're a naturally hot sleeper, this may not be the best pick for you.Because of its bulkier design, it's not as easily portable as other travel pillows. It's also one-size-fits-all, so it's not adjustable, but with the added hand and armholes at the top, you can comfortably wear this pillow while lying or sitting against any surface, from the airplane seat to napping on the airport floor. Some users even wear the Original Napping Pillow in bed at night to help them fall asleep faster.Ostrichpillow offers various pillows and travel products, from the regular Go Neck Pillow (check it out in our honorable mentions below) to the Mini Handy Pillow to eye masks. It also offers a 100-day return period and a two-year warranty, some of the best company policies we've seen for travel pillows.Pros:Encompassing coziness for sleepingGreat return and warranty policiesCons:Does not pack smallGets a little warm after a whileExpensiveReturn policy: 100 daysWarranty: Two-year warrantyWashability: Spot clean and air dry
$99 at Ostrich Pillow

Pluto Pod 2.0
Best premium travel pillow
$145 at Pluto
No travel pillow says "I need space" like the Pluto Pod 2.0. You'll look like an astronaut, and it's worth it for the enhanced travel experience. Immediately, JD and I could tell it's made with high-quality and durable materials, yet it still feels lightweight. After wearing it for a while, we were impressed by how breathable it is, even with the hood and eyemask fully drawn. You can block out the world entirely without feeling constricted or claustrophobic, which makes it especially ideal for long flights and trips. It's like being inside a mini sensory deprivation tank, making sleeping easier while traveling. The hood is large and spacious enough to wear with over-the-ear headphones. The neck pillow's design was initially inspired by a neck brace, which Pluto dialed back to make it feel supportive and cushioning. The velcro strap around the neck pillow has a strong stick and makes the pillow comfortably adjustable. Pluto thought of everything with the Pod 2.0, and it's obviously been constructed based on feedback from frequent flyers, flight attendants and sleep experts. It rolls up like a burrito and packs small. The outer surfaces are machine washable; all you have to do is remove the foam inside first. If you're concerned about people staring at you while wearing this travel pillow, don't be -- they're probably just jealous.Pros:VersatileCrafted with durable and breathable materialsCompletely blocks out the world Great company policies Cons:ExpensiveReturn policy: 125 daysWarranty: One-year warrantyWashability: Machine-washable cover
$145 at Pluto

Cabeau Evolution Kids
Best travel pillow for kids
$30 at Cabeau
The Evolution Kids Neck Pillow from Cabeau is a cute and functional travel companion for kids. Whether your family is going on a short car ride or taking a long flight, this pillow can help your child feel cozy and comfortable while keeping their head and neck from bobbing or jostling around. The super-soft cover is made of RPET fabric, an eco-friendly recycled material that won't irritate sensitive skin. We loved Cabeau's fun animal designs and color options, and reading the reviews reveals that children love them, too. These pillows are recommended for children ages 3 and up. Pros:Multiple designs and color choicesSupportive yet breathable Soft fabric won't irritate skinBudget-friendlyCons:Comes in only one sizeReturn policy: 30 daysWarranty: One-year limited warrantyWashability: Machine washable
$30 at Cabeau
Using the Hest Pro Travel Pillow to take a quick catnap at the airport. Aly Lopez/CNETHonorable mentionsThe market is inundated with travel pillows of all shapes, sizes, functionalities and pricing, making it difficult to narrow down your options. We were strict with our testing and reviewing process to bring you a versatile list of the top travel pillows you can buy online. We want to shout out a handful of other travel pillows that impressed us while testing and deserve an honorable mention. Ostrichpillow Go Neck pillowIf you're looking for another memory foam travel pillow option, check out the Ostrichpillow Go Neck pillow. JD has used this pillow on many trips, and its shape and density have held well over time. The dense memory foam molds to your chin and neck, and there's a velcro strap for adjusting and holding the pillow in place. It's surprisingly lightweight and compacts easily into the small carrying pouch.Ostrichpillow Go Neck pillow
$69 at Ostrich Pillow
Cabeau TNE S3 Neck PillowThe Cabeau TNE S3 Neck Pillow has contouring memory foam and raised sides that fully support your neck, keeping your mouth closed and preventing your head from bobbing forward. If you're looking for a travel pillow that will keep your head and jaw feeling secure and locked in place, this is the one for you. It also comes in a variety of fun and bright colors. Cabeau TNE S3
$50 at Cabeau
Dot&Dot Twist Memory FoamThe Twist Memory Foam pillow by Dot&Dot has a unique, twistable design that allows you to shape it to support any position for getting some sleep while traveling. The soft cotton cover is machine washable. JD and I both mentioned that we wished it was a little longer to make it even more versatile. For $20, it's a great value. Dot&Dot Twist Memory Foam

Travel pillow FAQs
Why should I use a travel pillow?
A travel pillow can provide support and comfort for your head and neck, which is important for long car rides or flights to prevent straining, stiffness and soreness. Using a travel pillow to help you sleep comfortably can lessen the effects of jet lag and ultimately help you arrive at your destination in better shape.
How much should I spend on a travel pillow?
A quality travel pillow typically costs between $30 and $60, depending on the brand, materials and additional features such as adjustable straps or washability. If you travel frequently or have a big trip coming up, investing in a quality travel pillow can be worth it. There are plenty of great affordable travel pillows priced around $15-$20 and more premium options costing up to $150-$200. Ultimately, it comes down to your budget and the features you're looking for.
Are travel pillows machine washable?
Many travel pillows have removable, machine-washable covers, as brands recognize the importance of keeping your pillow fresh and clean for trips. Always check the company's care instructions before throwing your travel pillow in the washer or dryer (especially since most travel pillow covers require washing in cold water and air drying).
Is memory foam good for a travel pillow?
Travel neck pillows are crafted to deliver superior comfort and support, reducing neck strain and enhancing sleep during extended trips. Look for one with approximately 5 inches of memory foam around the entire pillow for ideal support.
What's better? Microbeads or memory foam?
