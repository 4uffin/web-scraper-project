An air mattress can be handy when you need an inflatable bed for camping, don't have an extra bed for a guest or become ill and need to quarantine in a separate room. Unlike a traditional mattress, it can be easily deflated and folded up for storage, making it great for small spaces where having more than one bed isn't possible. Over the years, CNET's sleep experts have tested hundreds of mattresses, and that includes air mattresses. Based on size, price, warranty, weight limit and design, these are the best air mattresses that both you and your guests will enjoy sleeping on all night.

What is the best overall air mattress?We know there are an overwhelming number of options online, which is why our experts slept on numerous air beds to find the best. We determined that the best model overall is the SoundAsleep Dream Series. This air mattress is the most durable we tested, thanks to its 40 internal air coils, 19-inch-tall profile and waterproof construction. It comes in various sizes, including twin, twin XL, full, queen, king and California king. While it is one of the most expensive on this list, it should last you a long time -- and if it doesn't, there's a one-year warranty.
The SoundAsleep Dream Series mattress is comfortable, durable and holds air overnight with very minimal deflation.

Best overall air mattress
SoundAsleep Dream Series
Pros
Sturdy with an air coil design
30-day, no-questions-asked return period and a 1-year warranty
Easy to fold up and store -- comes with a nylon drawstring sack
Waterproof
Cons
Off-gassing when first opened
At $150 for a queen, it's not cheap
The SoundAsleep Dream Series Luxury air mattress is immensely popular and highly rated. It's not the cheapest option out there, but it does what air mattresses are meant to do -- and it does it well.Why we chose this air mattress: Priced at $150 for a queen-size, the SoundAsleep air mattress is more expensive than most of the other models we tested in its height range -- but it's worth the investment. This mattress has over 46,500 five-star customer reviews on Amazon, testifying to its durability and comfort. Fakespot, which grades the trustworthiness of Amazon testimonials, gives this bed's reviews an "A."When fully inflated, this quality air mattress stands 19 inches off the ground. It features a "ComfortCoil Technology" design with 40 internal air coils for added durability and support. The bottom is grippy to help prevent it from sliding on a slippery floor. Like many inflatable beds with a built-in pump, it's plenty heavy, weighing about 19 pounds. The pump is rather loud while inflating, but powerful. It took a reasonable 3.5 minutes to fully inflate the mattress and about the same to deflate it.Who should get it: The SoundAsleep Dream Series air mattress is an excellent choice for those who frequently need a temporary sleep solution, such as accommodating guests or camping outdoors. Its thick, puncture-resistant material and waterproof top make it built to last. It comes with a travel bag, making it ideal for those bringing it along for road trips, camping or moving.Who shouldn't: This air mattress can hold up to 500 pounds, less than other mattresses on this list. If you're sharing the air mattress, and you and your partner weigh over 250 pounds each, you'll probably want to consider a more supportive one that can hold up to 600 pounds or more.  ... Show more

Intex/Amazon
Best sturdy air mattress
Intex Comfort Plush Dura-Beam
Pros
Sturdy and firm with horizontal air chambers
Tallest air mattress on our list at 22 inches
Little to no off-gassing smell
Great option for couples
Affordable price at $75 for a queen
Cons
Pump isn't as powerful; doesn't inflate as fast as others on the market
Patches may not stick on the velvet material
Not water resistant
Why we chose this air mattress: Intex has struck a compelling balance between price and value with the Comfort Plush Elevated Dura-Beam. Although it's on the cheaper side, the Intex Comfort Plush Dura-Beam air mattress is impressively sturdy and firm, with horizontal air chambers. While it may not be the best overall, it's comfortable enough to sleep on for extended periods. The integrated, plug-in pump isn't as fast to inflate as others, but it's plenty powerful."The Intex Comfort Dura-Beam is easily my favorite air mattress because it’s thick and surprisingly sturdy. I’ve never had it deflate on me in the night. It’s definitely thicker than many other air mattresses, so it’s not a bad idea to snag some deep-pocket sheets," says Taylor Leamey, CNET senior writer.The top and sides of the mattress are coated in a velvety treatment that Intex says makes it more puncture-resistant. That may be true, but it also means that if a leak happens, you'd better hope it's on the bottom panel -- the only place a patch will stick. The off-gassing smell wasn't as strong compared to the others we tested. It comes with a duffel bag for storage and easy transport, though it weighs a decently hefty 22 pounds.Who should get it: This air mattress ranks among the firmest blow-up mattresses that we tested, meaning it's better for those who sleep on their back or stomach. It's also a great affordable option for couples -- the bed is surprisingly stable, so the movements of another person next to you shouldn't be overly bothersome. It has slightly taller edges around the perimeter to help prevent that roll-off sensation if you're lying near the edge. With a weight capacity of 600 pounds and a height of 22 inches, it's suitable for heavier body types.Who shouldn't: Side sleepers may not find the pressure relief needed on this air mattress (though most air mattresses are naturally on the firmer side).  ...

Best budget air mattress
Intex Dura-Beam Plus
Pros
Raised pillow rest
Cozy, velvety surface
Top is more plush than the Comfort series
Affordable price
Lightweight and easy to travel with (12.6 pounds)
Cons
Not as tall as the other air beds on this list at 16.5 inches
It's hard to put the cable back into the compartment next to the plug
No king-size
Why we chose this air mattress: As one of the leading air mattress brands, Intex offers many different models of quality air beds. The Intex Dura-Beam Plus Pillow Rest has a built-in pump, a raised pillow rest at the top and an inflated thickness of 16.5 inches off the ground. It also has a carrying bag with handles. I found this air mattress to be as great as the Comfort Plush and at an even better price of $53 for a queen.Who should get it: I like that the top of the Dura-Beam Plus is more plush than the Comfort Plush (despite the name). This is a good option for side sleepers seeking a bit more cushioning. Its vertical air chambers protrude more on its velvety surface, making it slightly bouncier. With a weight limit of 600 pounds, it's also sturdy and should fit two people comfortablyThis air mattress is the lightest we tested, weighing 12.6 pounds. It's also water resistant. These characteristics make it an excellent option for camping and outdoor adventures.I had a hard time shoving the cord back into its plastic compartment -- but all in all, it's not a bad air mattress for the price.Who shouldn't: If you're looking for a flat sleep surface, go with the Comfort Plush instead. The Plus air mattress isn't as tall, which is something to consider if you want to be higher off the ground. This model is only available in twin and queen, so it's not for those seeking a king-size air mattress.  ... Show more

Best dual-pump air mattress
Serta Raised Air Mattress
Pros
Extra pump to keep it inflated
Three firmness levels
2-year warranty; will replace at no cost
Supportive design with coils
Comes with a carrying bag with handles
Cons
Only available in queen and twin sizes
In order for the second pump to work, it has to be plugged in all night
On the expensive side
Why we chose this air mattress: One of the most annoying things about air mattresses is that they sometimes deflate during the night. No one likes to sleep on a slow-sinking, sagging surface. The Serta Raised Air Mattress addresses this problem with its two-pump design. The large pump is used to fill the mattress, and a second pump works (quietly) during the night to keep the air pressure constant. Keep in mind that if you want the second pump to work, the mattress has to be plugged in all night, which is a drawback.While the air mattress's top is not as pillowy as the Dura-Beam Plus, it feels supportive thanks to its addition of coils on the inside. When fully inflated, it stands 18 inches tall and has a weight limit of 500 pounds. It's crafted with waterproof and puncture-resistant materials and comes with a generous two-year warranty.Who should get it: If you want the ability to choose and adjust your firmness level, this is the air mattress to get. On the initial pump, there is a dial you can set to your desired firmness level (plush, medium or firm). This way, the bed will automatically fill to your ideal level and you won't have to guess how much air you need.Who shouldn't: If you're using the air mattress for camping or somewhere without electricity, this may not be the best option, as the "never flat" pump requires being plugged in.  ...

Zempire
Best air mattress for glamping
Zempire Monstabed Air Bed
Pros
Dual-chamber air mattress that may be more comfortable than the bed you sleep on at home
Soft-touch surface on top for added comfort
Good height makes it easy to get in and out of
Packs down smaller than a twin mat and stretcher set up for camping
360-degree valves allow for quick inflation and deflation
Carrying bag with reinforcement straps included
Cons
A little pricey at $250+
No built-in air pump
Packed up, it’s a bit heavy at around 11 lbs compared to slimmer, inflatable camping mats
Would be nice if Zempire’s Monstapump was included (or bundled in at a discount)
Why we chose this air mattress: New Zealand-based Zempire bills its Monstabed as a “luxury” inflatable camping mattress, but it’s one of the best inflatable mattresses, period. While it’s a little pricey, it features an innovative design with two integrated inflatable chambers -- the top is essentially Zempire’s self-inflating Monstamat ($150) while the bottom is a TPU airbed. Depending on how much you inflate each chamber, you can adjust the level of firmness. But we liked how the top mat ends up almost feeling like a layer of memory foam and how firm the bed is overall. In fact, it could be more comfortable than the bed you sleep in at home. Available in a single ($250) or twin size ($400), it packs down quite nicely and is easy to set up, especially if you buy Zempire’s optional Monstapump ($50), which allows for quick inflation and deflation (the mattress does come with an adapter for other air mattress inflators as well as a repair kit).Who should get it: If you’re looking for an air mattress that feels like a real bed, this is the air mattress for you. It’s good for glamping and can also be used as a guest bed at home.Who shouldn't: With the single size weighing a little under 11 pounds packed up (it measures 18.9 x 13.8 x 13.8 inches), this probably isn’t an air mattress you’d want to trek into the wilderness with.  ...

Best camping air mattress
Coleman Airbed Cot
Pros
Queen-sized camping bed, great for couples
Easy to transport by car
Comfortable and supportive
Cons
Expensive at around $270
Sleeps warm (not breathable)
Does not self-inflate
Why we chose this bed: The Coleman Airbed Cot combo is great for anyone who wants to elevate their camping experience, literally and figuratively. The cot features an integrated zippered sheet that contains the air bed, so you can either use it altogether, the air bed alone, or just the cot alone.The cot underneath the airbed provides great support and lifts you off the ground, which is really nice for colder weather camping and makes you feel more like you’re sleeping at home compared to other camping setups I have tried in the past. The cot's design also allows for storage underneath, which makes fitting it into a smaller tent easier. The entire thing also comes in a nice carrying case and packs up relatively small, which is great for transporting it to a campsite. I slept on this air bed plus cot combination for over a week camping and got great sleep on it.Who should get this bed: Someone who loves to camp for extended periods of time and wants a sleep setup more like their bed at home should take a look at the Coleman Airbed Cot combo. Who shouldn't: Backpackers won’t get any use out of this bed. It is far too big and heavy. Also, if you are planning on having a multi-use air bed that you can use at home and for camping, I would look elsewhere because it doesn’t feature a pump that keeps the bed inflated throughout the night. It would be a good idea to double-check the dimensions of your tent to make sure it can fit the Airbed Cot before buying.  ...

Factors to consider when purchasing an air mattress
There are a few general things to consider when shopping for the best air mattress.Price Price is the primary criterion for most people searching for the best air mattress. A queen-size bed can cost as little as $30, while the most expensive air mattresses can cost hundreds of dollars. A higher price doesn't always mean a taller air bed, a better air mattress, better air pressure, a self-inflating mattress, a better sleeping surface, more comfort or a decent night's sleep.InflationThe best air mattresses have a built-in electric pump that plugs into a wall socket. Some have a battery-powered external rechargeable pump, which usually runs on four D-cells. A few come with a manual hand or foot pump. The plug-in pumps are usually powerful but heavy and loud. Battery-operated pumps are lighter and don't require a wall socket, but are typically less effective and less capable of fully inflating a mattress. A manual pump or a flat pump, on the other hand, can deliver a degree of firmness that the others can't match and need neither batteries nor an outlet, but will require a significant amount of physical labor to operate.
Here's an example of a manual foot pump for an outdoor air mattress.

It may be a primary consideration for older or disabled people who would have trouble getting on or off a bed that's too low to the ground. Likewise, an overly mushy mattress will be harder to dismount.LeakageIf you've ever tried to get a good night's rest on a bad air mattress before, you know that the touchstone for quality is how reliably it holds air. Nearly every air mattress is beset by customer reviews complaining about air leaks. You can tell that this is an industry that's familiar with these complaints: Every bed we tested was imprinted with disclaimers about how all air mattresses stretch when you inflate them and that you shouldn't just assume that they're leaking if they temporarily lose that initial level of firmness.Yet many air mattresses, whether they're stretched out or not, do leak during the night, even if you top them off. This mitigates the credibility of some manufacturers' claims. Some beds are simply more durable and better constructed than others. Airtightness is tricky to judge, even after you inflate an air mattress, and may reveal itself only over time. As such, most manufacturers offer a one-year warranty or guarantee. A few extend that to two years. Others will give you 90 days and throw in a few vinyl patches to cover up a puncture wound. How we test the best air mattresses
We tested the best mattresses the only way you can: by sleeping on them. We've taken the best air mattresses that are highly rated on Amazon and other major retail sites, including Target and Walmart, and put them through a battery of hands-on testing to see which might potentially offer comfortable sleep.This included repeatedly inflating and deflating air beds, evaluating their durability and construction. We subject them to the rigors of camping and a series of acrobatically inclined children's sleepovers to test them for comfort, air pressure and how puncture-resistant the air chamber is -- after all, air leaks are counterproductive to a great night's sleep. We also made sure to assess each air mattress on its price and reviews. We wanted to know if other people experienced punctures or leaks during use.To narrow down the best mattress options, we confined testing for our buyer's guide to queen-size mattress models and included comfort and price comparisons.

How to find a hole and patch an air mattress
Nothing is worse than dragging out your air mattress for a guest, and then the next morning, they wake up on the ground. Puncture holes and leaks are the death of air mattresses -- and they happen all too often. The good news is that you can find and patch holes in most air mattresses. Here's how. Finding a hole in an air mattress:Fully inflate the air mattress, but try not to over-inflate it. Over-inflating an air mattress with a hole in it can make it larger.Take a sponge or rag and apply soapy water across the surface of your air mattress. Make sure you get the seams.Watch for places where bubbles grow, which can indicate a leak.If there is no leak on the surface, move on to the sides and valve and finally, the bottom of the air mattress.When you locate the leak, mark it with a permanent marker.Patching a hole in an air mattress: Just because your air mattress has a hole doesn't mean you have to buy a new one. You can use air mattress patches. If you're looking to go down the DIY route, there are plenty of options. Start by deflating your air mattress and degreasing the area around the hole.Patch method: You can make an air mattress patch from any thin plastic, like a shower curtain or pool liner. Once you have your material, cut out a patch large enough to cover the puncture entirely, with an excess of about one inch on all sides. Then use a generous amount of glue to seal it to the air mattress. Press it tightly with your hand.Super glue: If you have a small hole along the seams, a good amount of super glue may be all you need to patch the hole. It's best to apply it in a couple of layers to ensure it completely covers the puncture.Duct tape: While it's not a long-term solution, duct tape can help you repair an air mattress in a pinch. The adhesive on duct tape generally loses its grip over time. Other air mattresses we tested
Beautyrest Hi-Loft Air Mattress: The Beautyrest Hi-Loft comes equipped with a plug-in electric pump that screws onto the mattress. Once attached, it inflates the mattress in about two minutes, although not as fully as I would've liked. Once it's inflated, you need to quickly unscrew the pump and replace the valve cap. It's not the most elegant solution.The Beautyrest air mattress has the same pack-of-hot-dogs design as the Bestway air bed below and the precarious feel of a pool float. (Many companies that make air mattresses also make inflatable pools and pool accessories. Go figure.) It lacks the stability of other air mattresses, and I nearly tipped it over by lying too far to one side.It may not be the best air mattress for you if you're tall. Simmons lists its dimensions at 80 by 60 by 17 inches, but my measurements put it closer to 76 inches long, which means that anyone taller than six feet will likely hang off the end. The mattress is constructed from a softer type of vinyl than others, making it easier to roll up and fold into a compact shape for storage.Beautyrest Hi-Loft Air Mattress

Bestway Tritech Air Mattress: The epitome of a cheap air mattress, the Bestway air bed is compact, lightweight and relatively quick to inflate with its integrated pump.On the downside, this air mattress is only available in one size, and it's not comfortable at all. It sits low to the ground at 12 inches high, and the pump isn't powerful enough to inflate it fully, so it makes for a squishy ride. The tubular design gives it the look of a pack of hot dogs, and the one raised, horizontal hot dog that's meant to approximate a pillow rest sets the mattress askew, which makes it more unstable.In addition to dozens of very positive reviews, the Bestway Air Bed has plenty of negative reviews on Walmart.com that cite slow air leaks, fast air leaks, burst seams, spontaneous bubbling and terrible customer service. Although Bestway's comically vague manufacturer's warranty doesn't instill confidence, warranty isn't a crucial consideration here, given the price. Still, Walmart's policy states that most products can be returned with their original packaging for a full refund within 90 days.Bestway Tritech Air Mattress

Best air mattresses FAQs
How do I choose the best air mattress?
When shopping for the best mattress, it's essential to carefully examine both product and customer reviews. Seek out insights from real customers and reviewers who have actually slept on the mattress. Their honest feedback can provide crucial information to help you confidently determine the mattress's quality. Make informed choices and invest in a product that truly meets your needs.
Can you sleep on an air mattress every night?
No, you shouldn't sleep on even the best air mattress as your main bed. Air mattresses are a good short-term solution when you need a comfortable place to sleep that's not the ground or a couch, but they aren't meant for regular use. Air mattresses can lack proper support to keep your spinal alignment over the long term and promote back pain. If you're in the market for a new regular mattress and are on a tight budget, check out our list of the best cheap mattresses you can buy online.
Where can I buy an air mattress?
Whether you choose to purchase an air mattress online or in a store ultimately depends on how you prefer to shop. Amazon has some great options, but you can also check your local Walmart or REI.
How can I make an air mattress more comfortable?
Air mattresses are a great option for guests and short-term use, but they will never be as comfortable as a normal bed. Fortunately, there are a couple of tricks you can use to make your air mattress more comfortable.-Put your air mattress on a soft surface, like a carpet or rug.-You can also put it on a box spring so it isn't flat on the ground.-Add a mattress topper or mattress pad. These add a layer of comfort while taking away the rubbery feel of air mattresses.
How long do air mattresses last?
How long your air mattress will last will depend on how much you use it. Regular and consistent use offers more opportunities for punctures or holes to develop in your mattress. Alternatively, if you use it only once a year, you can expect to hang on to it for a long time. You should expect to get at least two to five years out of a regularly used air mattress and up to 10 if you don't use it often.
How do I keep my air mattress from deflating?
There's nothing worse than an air mattress that deflates while you're sleeping on it. You don't want to over-inflate your air mattress, which will put excess strain on the seams. You should also pay close attention to the weight limit of the air mattress. Finally, deflate the air mattress every morning after use.
