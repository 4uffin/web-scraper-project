Give your kidneys a lift with these nutrient-packed, low-cost foods. Getty Images
Your kidneys help clear waste from your blood, balance fluid levels, regulate hormones and even influence things like blood pressure and energy.The best way to care for your kidneys is by eating plenty of nutrient-rich foods. The CDC estimates that more than 1 in 7 adults in the US are living with chronic kidney disease, and many don't even know it. That's why prevention and daily care are so important.Incorporating a handful of nutrient-rich superfoods into your regular meals can make a significant difference. These foods help reduce inflammation, support healthy blood flow and ease the load on your kidneys so they can keep doing their job. If you're looking to give your kidneys the boost they need, these 13 simple additions to your diet are a great way to start.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Your diet and gut health also play a major role in your wellness, especially when it comes to keeping your kidneys healthy. There are 13 superfoods you should keep in mind when considering natural ways to give your kidney health a boost. Read more: 6 Important Blood Tests You May Need for Your Overall HealthBest Meal Delivery Services

13 superfoods for kidney health1. CabbageThis nutrient-dense vegetable is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more.Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.2. Fatty fishFish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fats may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the National Kidney Foundation.If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has a chart you can use to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.
Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty Images3. Bell peppersLike cabbage, bell peppers pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.4. CranberriesCranberries help to prevent urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.Plus, cranberries have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.5. BlueberriesWe've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What foods help repair kidneys? Blueberries deliver.With high levels of antioxidants and loads of vitamin C and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.6. Dark, leafy greensThere are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get key vitamins and minerals, plus immunity-boosting benefits.Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.7. Olive oilRich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. A study from Harvard University found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.8. GarlicAnother antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For people with CKD, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.9. OnionsFrom the same family as garlic, onions give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.
Getty Images10. CauliflowerCauliflower brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.11. Egg whitesEgg whites are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.12. ArugulaArugula is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.13. ApplesApples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet. Leave a bowl of apples on your counter and you'll have a kidney-healthy, grab-and-go snack whenever you need one.
