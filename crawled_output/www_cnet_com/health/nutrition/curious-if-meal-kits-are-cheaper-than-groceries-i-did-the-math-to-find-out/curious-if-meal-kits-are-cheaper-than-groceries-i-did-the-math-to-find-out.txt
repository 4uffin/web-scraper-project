Meal Kits Have Gotten Cheap, but Are They Cheaper Than Groceries?
Groceries have never been more expensive, but meal kit prices have remained fairly stable. I did the math to see how much three popular meal kit companies cost when compared with food bought at the supermarket.
David Watsky Senior Editor / Home and Kitchen David lives in Brooklyn where he's spent more than a decade covering all things edible, including meal kit services, food subscriptions, kitchen tools and cooking tips.
David earned his BA from Northeastern and has toiled in nearly every aspect of the food business, including as a line cook in Rhode Island where he once made a steak sandwich for Lamar Odom.
Right now he's likely somewhere stress-testing a blender or tinkering with a toaster. Anything with sesame is his all-time favorite food this week. Expertise Kitchen tools | Appliances | Food science | Subscriptions | Meal kits

Meal kits can actually save you money, if you know how to game the system. David Watsky/CNET
Bloated costs on everything from eggs to olive oil have folks looking for ways to cut costs. Meal kits -- once considered a splurge -- may not have caused a blip on your thrifty radar. While supermarkets seemingly jack prices up at will, meal kit companies have been more careful when raising consumer costs, since retaining subscribers is key to their survival.Best Meal Delivery Services for 2025
See at Cnet
Meal kit services such as EveryPlate, Blue Apron or HelloFresh are known for helping busy people save time and eat better, but I crunched the numbers to find out if any of the top meal delivery services are cheaper than a supermarket haul of the same items.Meal kits vs. buying the groceries
Cost per serving (average plan)Cost of same ingredients at grocery store EveryPlate $6$5.40Blue Apron $11$9.75HelloFresh $9$6.55
After looking at several ingredient lists for various recipes, I found that some meal kits are more expensive while others are about the same price as grocery shopping, or in some cases, even cheaper. It depends on the service and, more importantly, the meals you choose.Here's a breakdown and how I got these figures.How I did the math
I put on my math hat to see if meal kits are actually a good deal in 2025. Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesTo see how much Blue Apron, HelloFresh and EveryPlate meals cost to make, I priced out the ingredients for two real recipes that are included in a standard subscription. When choosing groceries, I used the cheapest version of the same or similar ingredient I could find at Shop-Rite, a budget-friendly grocery store in my area. Because meal kit recipes include only the amount of ingredients needed, I prorated the cost by how much you would actually use for a recipe, not the full price of the bottle, jar, box or bag. I chose basic, nonorganic items unless it was otherwise specified in the meal kit recipe. How I picked the recipes
I picked steak and seafood recipes to compare since they represent the best value on most meal kit menus.  David Watsky/CNETIf you're looking to meal kits as a value proposition, you'll have to be smart about which recipes you choose. Steak, chicken and fish tend to be more expensive to cook at home than plant-based meals, so I specifically chose recipes featuring those proteins. (I also recommend you take advantage of them if you're signing up for a service).Not all services include steak recipes without a surcharge, but HelloFresh and Blue Apron do. Blue Apron typically offers at least one fairly high-end beef cut like sirloin steak with no added charge. HelloFresh offers one or two beef recipes per week, but they're usually a cheaper cut like chuck steak. Seafood options are limited with a basic HelloFresh, but I found a barramundi recipe on this week's menu in addition to the ranch steak with Caesar salad. Budget-friendly services including EveryPlate don't usually offer steak or seafood, which is how it keeps prices low. For my EveryPlate analysis, I chose a cherry beef meatball and pork chop recipe.Blue Apron presents real value if you choose the right meals
Blue Apron's seafood recipes including steak, salmon and trout prove to be an excellent value in 2025. Blue ApronBlue Apron has the most high-end recipes of the three I chose to analyze. I picked a recipe featuring sirloin steak and another with fresh filets of steelhead trout.When I priced out the groceries to make these meals, they clocked in at $11.26 and $8.23, respectively, with an average price of $9.75 per serving. Both meals proved more expensive to buy at the supermarket than the $8 per-serving cost for the largest (cheapest) Blue Apron plan. As good as that sounds, Blue Apron's largest plan is a whopping five meal kits per week with four servings each, and likely practical for most people. If you choose a more reasonably sized plan -- let's say three meal recipes with four servings each -- the price per serving jumps to $10. That's still cheaper than the cost of buying the groceries, but only by a little. Add the $11 weekly shipping cost, and the Blue Apron creeps over the cost of buying groceries, but only slightly. When you consider the convenience a meal kit provides, it's hard to argue that Blue Apron isn't a good value.Blue Apron vs buying the groceries
Trout with feta, couscous and vegetables Ingredients: Cost:Steelhead trout filets, 10 oz $11.50Pearl couscous, 1/2 cup $24 oz. grape tomatoes $1.251 red onion $1.29Crushed pepper flakes $0.10Feta cheese, 1/2 oz $2Spice blend, 1 tbs $0.25Green beans, 6 oz $3Roasted sunflower seeds, 2 tbs $0.50Pitted niçoise olives, 1 oz $0.64Total:$22.53Per serving:$11.26 Mexican steak with green beans and sweet potatoesIngredients: Cost:2 sirloin steaks, 11 oz $7Guajillo chile pepper sauce, 1/3 cup $1Lime, 1 $0.50Raw pepitas, 2 tbs $0.59Cotija cheese, 2 tbs $0.60Sweet potatoes, 1 lb $3Green beans, 6 oz $3Smoky spice, 1 tbs $0.25Garlic, 2 clove $0.20Worcestershire sauce, 2 tbs $0.46Total cost:$16.55 Per serving:$8.23
See at Blue ApronHelloFresh was the worst value
HelloFresh meal kits cost $10 per serving but only around $6.50 per serving if you were to buy the groceries yourself. HelloFreshHelloFresh might be the most popular meal kit service, but it was also the worst value of the three. I chose a barramundi recipe and chuck steak meal kit to compare with local grocery prices. By my calculations, HelloFresh meal kits would cost just $6.55 per serving to buy the groceries and make the meals yourself. That's about $2.50 cheaper than HelloFresh's average meal plan of $9 per serving, and that's all before factoring in your weekly delivery cost of $11. If you were to spread that shipping fee out across two or three meal kits, the actual per-serving cost is more like $11 to $12. HelloFresh may have one of the largest weekly menus of meal kits and user-friendly ordering interface, but as it turns out, the popular service doesn't offer as much value as other meal kit companies. HelloFresh vs buying the groceries
Barramundi with lemony carrots & couscous
Ingredient: Cost:Barramundi, 10 oz $7.56Carrots, 12 oz $1.50Lemon, 1 $0.57Cumin, 1 tsp $0.23Israeli Couscous, 2.5 oz $0.75Cilantro, ¼ oz $1Garlic, 2 cloves $0.20Chili flakes, 1 tsp $0.23Veggie stock concentrate, 1 packet $1Total: $13.04Per serving:$6.52 Balsamic-glazed steak tagliata Ingredient: Cost:Potatoes, 12 oz $1.50Lemon, 1 $0.57Italian seasoning, 1 tbs $0.50Garlic powder, 1 tps $0.23Ranch steak, 10 oz $6Mixed greens, 2 oz $0.70Caesar dressing, 1.5 oz $0.45Croutons, 2 oz $1.00Parmesan cheese, 3 tbs $1.50Balsamic glaze, 5 tsp $0.80Total:$13.17 Per serving:$6.59
See at HelloFreshEveryPlate is also about the same as buying groceries
EveryPlate meal kits clocked in at $5.40 per serving when ingredients were purchased at the store. That's just a hair cheaper than the service, making it a great value if you're trying to save time and energy. David Watsky/CNETEveryPlate's two meal kits cost $4.98 and $5.82 when purchased a la carte at the grocery store, which averages out to $5.40. That's just 60 cents less than the per-serving price of EveryPlate's meal kits, which cost $6 per serving no matter which plan you choose.Add the $10 shipping cost per box and the meal kit cost creeps up a bit, but it's still around the same price as buying all the groceries yourself.EveryPlate's meal kit menus don't feature much in the way of steak or seafood so you can expect more budget-friendly proteins such as chicken, ground beef and pork chops. EveryPlate meals are also easy to make and satisfying, making it our top pick best cheap meal kit service.EveryPlate vs buying the groceries
