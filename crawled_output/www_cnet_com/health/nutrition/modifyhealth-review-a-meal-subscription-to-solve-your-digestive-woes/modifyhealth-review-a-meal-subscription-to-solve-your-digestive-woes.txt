Final verdict on ModifyHealth
As a longtime IBS sufferer, trying any new food can feel a bit like a dangerous game of chance. While many foods taste delicious, they can trigger bouts of indigestion that don't make eating fun. When I heard about a meal delivery service that aims to help find food triggers for those with persistent stomach issues, I thought perhaps my luck had changed.ModifyHealth's mission is to curate meals that help identify and curb food triggers. The curated subscription delivers healthy food for those with different dietary goals and restrictions, ranging from low-FODMAP to treat gut disorders to Mediterranean Diet to assist those on a general healthy eating or weight-loss journey. Best Meat Delivery Services for 2025
See at Cnet
In addition to an arsenal of healthy, goal-tailored meals, customers are also offered the optional service of meeting with a registered dietician to create a customizable nutrition plan. These medical professionals can even go so far as to recommend specific ModifyHealth offerings, as well as walk clients through elimination diets to pinpoint issues and/or work around specific diagnoses and triggers. I opted for low-FODMAP varieties to identify what may be contributing to IBS and colitis flares. FODMAPs (short for fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) are a collection of short-chain carbohydrates (sugars) found in many foods and food additives that can be hard for some people to digest. And while someone can be sensitive to multiple categories (i.e. dairy, grains, nightshades, etc.), that isn't always the case and requires a few weeks of food journaling (which the nutritionist recommended) to paint a clearer picture of what activates gastric distress. Here's everything you need to know about the company and my own experience. How does ModifyHealth work?
Modify Health's gluten-free menu has over 45 recipes to choose from. Screenshot by David Watsky/CNETModifyHealth has broken down its ordering, delivery, and preparation process into four easy steps: Select your plan: Choose from one of seven carefully curated meals plans that have been developed to accommodate a range of dietary preferences and needs. These include low-FODMAP for optimal digestive health, Mediterranean for general health and wellness, diabetes-friendly for blood sugar sensitivity, gluten-free for gluten sensitivity, heart-friendly for heart health and lower blood pressure, carb-conscious for reduced carbohydrate intake and GLP-1 support for healthy, sustainable weight loss. Enjoy healthy meals. Once you've established which plan will align with your current health goals (which can also be identified through a complimentary consultation), customers are required to order a minimum of six meals, including optional breakfast items. Support at your side. While completely voluntary, customers also have the opportunity to partake in a supplemental FIT Quickstart program to schedule ongoing guidance from a team of dietitians. These medical experts are available via phone or video chat, and there is even a dedicated hotline for more on-demand support.Stay well. As with all new nutritional programs, consistency is key to identify the ingredients that either have you feeling great or cause bouts of inflammation or indigestion. Meal subscriptions require no commitments other than a minimum of six meals/week that can be changed, paused or canceled at any time.
The low-FODMAP menu has more than 30 options at any given time. Joey Skladany/CNETHow much does ModifyHealth cost?
Meals cost a little more than $13, which is a bit higher than average but reasonable considering the quality.  Screenshot by CNETMeals are currently priced at $10 for breakfasts and $13.45 for entrees with a purchase minimum of six per week. Should you want to tack on a FIT Quickstart membership with access to dieticians (which includes a complimentary consultation and three sessions), the price is a one-time fee of $399. These members will also have access to downloadable resources, as well as 50% off their first meal purchase (though you do not need to purchase any meals to take part in this program). ModifyHealth is also in-network with many major insurance providers, making this upgrade entirely free or affordable for many customers. Shipping and delivery
Meals arrived safely in an insulated box and without a ton of extra plastic.  David Watsky/CNETThe commitment is a minimum of six meals per week. Customers can make changes like meal swaps, pauses and cancellations through their online account or by calling the company directly at 888-7MODIFY. Since meals are prepared fresh, these changes must be placed by Saturday at 11:59 p.m. ET. Otherwise, you will be locked into next week's shipment. Deliveries are completely free, take place nationwide and typically arrive via major carriers. If someone isn't home to accept the box, it will be left on your doorstep and kept cool with ice packs. Meals will stay fresh for seven to 10 days if stored in the refrigerator and six to eight weeks if stored in the freezer. Packaging, including the vacuum-sealed plastic wrap, is recyclable. What are ModifyHealth's meals like?
Some meals needed a little help by way of added salt, spice or hot sauce. Joey Skladany/CNETDon't expect a Michelin-star feast, but do expect an assortment of proteins and vegetables with transparent nutrition labels. Prior to meal selection, customers also have the ability to eliminate specific ingredients with a convenient dropdown bar to further personalize their purchase. I was able to try a handful of options, some better than others. Should you feel the need to add hot sauce, spices or other enhancements, the foundation is there and won't clash with what's already in the tray. The best ModifyHealth meals I triedCoconut Curry Tofu with Bok Choy: Bok choy, like creamed spinach, is also a trigger for me. While I felt like this lacked actual coconut flavor, I was impressed with veggie's satisfying crunch after being microwaved.
The coconut curry had a muted flavor profile, as do many of ModifyHealth's meals, but the vegetables still had their crunch. Joey Skladany/CNETChicken Taco Bowl with Cilantro Rice, Black Beans and Corn Salsa: It's hard to ruin straightforward and uncomplicated Mexican food. A few dashes of Tabasco jazzed this right up. Pesto Mahi Mahi with Creamed Spinach and Italian Herb Green Beans: My stomach was never able to stand up to a creamed spinach until I sampled this iteration. It may not be the most decadent, but it was an IBS win and I'll take as many as I can get. Savory Pot Roast with Thyme and Rosemary: This was the most comforting of the bunch, though I did add dried herbs to make it more potent.
The pot roast was cooked well but a little light on that signature herby flavor. Joey Skladany/CNETWho is ModifyHealth good for?
Joey Skladany/CNETWhile anyone can benefit from a more personalized approach to nutrition, the company excels by backing its range of meals with medical evidence and dietician services. This is a great opportunity for those who either want to start a healthier food journey or may have recently received a diagnosis that requires a more regimented, strict diet. It's great for those trying to determine which foods trigger GI issues, especially with the guidance of a licensed dietitian. ModifyHealth exists so that the process of pivoting your lifestyle doesn't have to feel like too much of a burden, as they have the meals, people and resources to support you every step of the way. It's also convenient. Not having to worry about specific ingredients, especially gluten, can remove a lot of the anxiety that goes into grocery shopping and preparing dishes that are unique to your needs. Who is ModifyHealth not so good for?
Nutrition information and ingredients for all meals is listed on the packaging. Modify HealthIf you care less about nutrition and more about five-star flavor, ModifyHealth may be a bit of a letdown. Nothing was inedible, but a lot of the meals were no-frills and in need of salt, pepper and even hot sauce. That said, a bit of blandness is important to pinpoint potential triggers, especially if partaking in an elimination diet. ModifyHealth is by no means a cure for GI issues, but it can help you determine what your triggers are. If you already know which foods bother stomach and how to avoid them, the consultations might not be as illimuniating. Final verdict on ModifyHealthModifyHealth has found a way to revolutionize an oversaturated industry by pairing its meals with medical clout. I genuinely enjoyed my sessions with the knowledgeable dietician and was surprised at how none of the low-FODMAP meals instigated the often-inevitable diarrhea, gas or bloating. (And if they did, the dietician would have been able to identify the perpetrator.) If you're in need of a diet overhaul and/or seek the assistance of a professional to walk you through a revised daily food pyramid, this is the one to try. You may just need the salt and pepper shakers on standby. Try it at ModifyHealth
