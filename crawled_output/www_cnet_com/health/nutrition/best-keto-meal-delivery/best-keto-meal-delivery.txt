Meal kits have become cheaper and more flexible to customers lately, with Blue Apron dropping its subscription requirement altogether. Meal delivery services are also now better suited to those with special dietary needs, including folks following the keto diet. Going keto by cutting carbs has been shown to help people shed unwanted weight and boost energy, when done in moderation and under the guidance of a doctor.

SCORE
Pros
Large selection of healthy, keto meals with 15 grams of net carbs or less
The food is mostly solid
Fairly affordable at $11-14 per serving
Offers seven different diets
Free shipping on first order
Takes only 2 minutes in microwave
Dietician-approved
Cons
Fewer interesting recipes can lead to food fatigue
Some unnecessary packaging
No vegan/vegetarian meals
Shipping costs $10.99 after first order
Only offers single serving
Why we like it: Factor offers a keto meal delivery plan for customers who are looking to follow a low-carb diet. The Factor keto meal delivery plan includes breakfast, lunch and dinner options that are all low in carbohydrates and high in healthy fats. Who is it best for: Factor's weekly keto menu features fewer bold recipes and flavors and more comfort-style food such as burgers, grilled chicken and meatloaf, making it a good choice for picky eaters or those with a less adventurous palate. All of Factor's keto meals are made with mostly organic, non-GMO ingredients and are free from gluten, soy and artificial preservatives. In addition to a low carb count, Factor keto meals are also designed to be low in calories to aid in weight loss.Who should not get it: These keto meals are 15 grams of net carbs or less, so if that is not the keto diet you're following, another service might be better. Also, Factor 75 only offers single servings, so couples or families should choose a different service.  ... Show more

Why we like it: Green Chef is one of the healthiest meal kit delivery services and caters to an array of designer diets including a keto meal plan for folks looking to cut carbs. With a Green Chef meal kit subscription, you'll find creative keto meals.Who is it best for: A bevy of chef-created recipes -- at least four keto options per week -- coupled with Green Chef's high-quality, mostly USDA organic ingredients make for a pricier subscription, but Green Chef is worth it for those seeking healthy meal kits delivered each week.Who should not get it: Green Chef's keto meals are 20 grams or less of net carbs, so another service may be better if that's too high for your diet.

Pete's Real Food

/10
SCORE
Pros
Food is all tasty and well-prepared
Good for keto and paleo eaters
Ships nationwide, including Alaska and Hawaii
Only requires 3 minutes in the microwave
Cons
Expensive at $15-21
Shipping is around $40
Only 5 meals per week on keto diet
Only single serving available
Meal plans and pricing are a little confusing
No dietary certifications listed
Why we like it: The paleo and keto diets have a lot in common, but there are some important distinctions too. If you're more inclined to keep to a paleo plan that allows for healthy foods that may also have a high carb count, like carrots and sweet potatoes, then I'd recommend Pete's Real Food prepared keto meals. You can still order plenty of low-carb, keto-friendly meals through Pete's Real Food, but it's not the foundational diet plan for this meal delivery service. I tried several of the service's healthy options loaded with protein and healthy fats and I was entirely impressed. A slow-cooked pork shoulder with sweet potatoes and celery was tender, with great flavor. Another win was the moist Mediterranean chicken thigh dinner with salty olives, served alongside spaghetti squash and cauliflower. This is thoughtfully prepared and healthy food made with quality paleo-friendly ingredients.Who is it best for: I would recommend Pete's Real Food for those who are more inclined to keep a paleo diet. For those looking to save time on cooking, these prepared meals are also great because they require about 3 minutes in the microwave.Who should not get it: Pete's Real Food is expensive at $13-18 per serving with shipping around $40 (depending on your location). You can also only get five meals per week on the keto diet with only a single serving available. No dietary certifications are listed.  ... Show more

Why we like it: If you're looking to make keto dinners at home, Home Chef has the most keto-friendly meal kits of any service I tried, and that makes it an excellent choice for those keeping to a low-carb keto diet. Home Chef's Carb Conscious meal plan starts at about $8 a serving and there are typically around 14 meal kits to choose from in any given week containing less than 15 grams of carbs per serving. Who is it best for: One great feature Home Chef offers is that you can swap or double the protein in any meal and since keto diet followers are all about that protein, it makes finding the right low-carb meals each week that much easier. Home Chef also has oven-ready keto-friendly meal options.The company offers up to six servings and six keto-friendly meals per week, making it great for families. Who should not get it: If 15g of net carbs or less is not part of your keto diet, this service is not for you. Some meals also have a longer prep time of 60 minutes, but that's not the case for all.

Other keto meal delivery services we tried
ModifyHealth: This healthy meal delivery service specializes in low-FODMAP to help those with IBS but also offers a low-carb meal plan. The food was tasty and the free health counseling was useful, but it's a bit more expensive than some others on our list.Snap Kitchen: I liked Snap Kitchen meals but the portions were a bit small and the service still has a limited delivery area.Territory Foods: The portions from this meal delivery service were far too small considering how expensive they are -- as much as $23 a meal -- but they did taste OK. If you're looking for some serious portion control for weight loss and to cut down on calories, this might be a good option. Otherwise, it doesn't seem worth the money. FlexPro: These frozen keto meals were some of the worst I tried and I would not recommend the service.BistroMD: These meals are intended to promote weight loss, but the cost is high, and the flavors weren't good enough to justify the price. Factors to consider when choosing a keto meal service
Meal format preferences The first big decision you'll make is whether you want meal kits, which provide ingredients and a recipe but require some prep and cooking, or prepared meals, which are fully cooked and ready to heat and eat. Meal kits will demand more of your energy and time (around 30 minutes of prep), but they'll also cost a little less per serving. Prepared meals require almost no time and energy, other than what it takes to heat them (usually a few minutes), but they typically run a few bucks more per serving. Prepared meals may be better for beginning cooks, and meal kits can work best for beginning to experienced cooks.
We also tested Fresh N Lean, but it's no longer in business. Fresh n' LeanBudget and valueAfter you've made your choice between meal kits or prepared meals, you'll want to find a service within your budget. Price per serving ranges from $11 to $17. There are meal kit services with basic menus and no-frills recipes for meals as cheap as $11 a serving. Pricier services include recipes with more exotic ingredients, high-end cuts of meat and organic produce, and those meals can cost as much as $17 a serving. For this list, the midrange price is around $12. Elsewhere on CNET, we've outlined all the best cheap meal delivery services right now.Shipping is usually free for the first order but after that costs $11 on average. More expensive prepared meal services can charge up to $40 for shipping, depending on your location. It's important to note that most meal kits and prepared meal delivery services offer you the option to skip a week and to pause or cancel your subscription. You can typically make these adjustments in your account settings or on your app. Keto strictness levelThere are different levels to keeping keto. One decision you'll want to make is whether to choose a meal service or meal plan that includes only or mostly keto or one, like Green Chef, that has options for nonketo meals. You'll also want to pay attention to the net carbs per meal and macro ratios to ensure they fit with your specific diet.If dietary certifications are important to you -- such as USDA organic or certified gluten free -- make sure the service you choose has these certifications. Or simply make sure the ingredients are grass-fed or wild-caught, if that's important to you.
Most meal kit services offer a range of keto recipes each week. David Watsky/CNETMeals per week and frequencyLastly, you'll want to home in on exactly how much food you'll want sent to you per week (aka meals per week). If you can't imagine yourself cooking more than twice per week, don't order more than two meal kits, because they typically won't last more than a week in the fridge. Also, think about serving options by considering the number of people you're cooking for each week.Most prepared meals either arrive frozen or can be frozen after unboxing. That means it's less of an issue if you order too many meals on your first go around. Most services allow you to change the number of meals or servings in your plan even after you've started.With nearly every service, the more meals your order per delivery, the cheaper it is per meal.  Why you should trust us
Over the past 5 years, our experts have tested various services by making more than 75 meals from kits and tasting over 100 prepared meals. All that has helped us put together our list of the best in 2025.  How we test keto meal kits
Meal kits are judged on several factors as we cook our way through a box of recipes. David Watsky/CNETTesting meal kits for CNET means rolling up our sleeves and cooking at least one week's worth of meals from each service, often more. How each meal kit tastes, how easy it was to prepare and the portion sizes are all considered. To learn more, we have an in-depth look at how we test meal kits here at CNET.Taste and quality evaluationOne of the main factors we test for is taste and the quality of the ingredients. We also pay attention to texture, how fresh the ingredients are, where they come from and if the ingredients have any certifications, such as USDA organic. Convenience and usabilityFor this part of our testing, we consider how long it takes to prepare or heat a meal. We pay attention to heating and cooking instructions in terms of clarity, details offered and what level of cooking experience may be required. Also, is packaging cumbersome, easy to access or sustainable?Customer experienceWe evaluate the website and how easy it is to navigate along by determining how easy it is to pause, cancel or change your order at any given time. Other factors we pay attention to are how easy the ordering process is and if delivery is reliable. Keto meal delivery FAQ

Is the keto diet healthy?
Many health professionals will tell you the best way to lose weight is by eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly, but trimming carbs, particularly empty ones, can help shed unwanted pounds in a shorter period. If you're like me, the thought of constantly cooking, especially diet food, can be a turn-off to healthy living as a whole. For more on the diet, read CNET's guide to the keto diet.

What is the keto diet?
Keto (short for ketogenic) started as something of a fad diet decades ago, when it was commonly referred to as the Atkins Plan or the South Beach Diet. People are drawn to keto and other low-carb programs for many reasons, such as wanting to limit their total carb count for weight loss or upping their protein intake to help build muscle or for training purposes. Many delivery services now cater to the keto diet.
