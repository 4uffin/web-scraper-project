A recent CNET survey revealed that 7% of US adults don't want to use meal kits because they're concerned about their dietary restrictions. I was one of those people, often assuming that as a vegetarian who regularly eats plant-based food, I wouldn't be able to find a meal delivery service that catered to my specific diet. However, after testing six meal kits and five prepared meal delivery services over the space of several months, I was pleasantly surprised to discover just how wrong I was. In fact, many companies do offer meals for various diets, which is one factor I considered during my testing, along with taste, cost per serving, family meals and the variety available. Our Picks

My freezer is stocked with Mosaic Foods. Anna Gragert/CNETMosaic Foods is the best vegan meal delivery service overall. Senior Home and Kitchen Editor David Watsky also awarded it the “best overall” during his testing over the past few years. That’s because it offers a wide variety of vegan meals at a straightforward $12 per serving while also tasting great and being easy to prepare in the microwave or on the stovetop.The best vegan meal delivery services of 2025 Filter by

Best vegan meal delivery overall
Mosaic Foods
9.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
About 24 vegan meals available each week
Around five family vegan meals available weekly
Straightforward $12 per serving
Family meals are about $6 per serving
Can be heated up in minutes
Delicious and tastes fresh despite being frozen
Packaging can be separated for recycling
Cons
$12 per serving is not the most affordable option
Shipping costs $10 for orders with less than 12 items
Why we like it: Most vegan meal delivery services offer a range of prices, which can make budgeting difficult. We like that Mosaic Foods bowls are one price: $12 per serving. Plus, out of all the services we tried, it offers the widest selection of prepared vegan meals that are frozen and can easily be microwaved for a few minutes or heated up in a pan on the stove. Though frozen, these meals still tasted fresh and weren’t too spicy or salty, which some vegan food can be guilty of. Mosaic Foods also offers family meals that are four servings, and the price comes out to about $6 per serving. There are five vegan family meals available and seven vegetarian meals.Who is it best for: Mosaic Foods would be best for vegans who want to save time with prepared frozen meals that simply need to be microwaved or heated on the stove. Additional diets offered by Mosaic Foods include vegetarian, no added sugar, lower carb and lower sugar. Several family meals with four servings are also available each week. If you're concerned about eco-friendliness, Mosaic Foods' packaging allows you to easily peel the plastic liner away from your meal’s cardboard tray, making recycling easier. However, the plastic may need to be recycled in-store.Who should not get it: Though having one price, $12 per serving, is helpful, it’s not affordable for every budget. Also, if you prefer fresh instead of frozen food, this wouldn’t be the service for you. For fresh food, Thistle would be better. If you’re looking for prepared vegan family meals and want more than five options, another service may be better.  ... Show more

Best vegan meal kits
Green Chef
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Tastes the best out of all the vegan meal kits tested
USDA-certified organic
Offers about four kits weekly for families up to six people
Recycling information is clear
Recipes were easy to make
Cons
More expensive at $12 per serving
Only offers about four vegan meal kits per week
Shipping is $11 after the first order
Why we like it: When choosing the best vegan meal kit, it was between Green Chef and Purple Carrot. However, Green Chef took the lead because, in my opinion, it offered the best-tasting vegan meal kits. At $12 per serving, Green Chef provides about four USDA-certified organic vegan meal kits weekly and offers keto, calorie-smart, gluten-free (about 4-5 meals per week) and high-protein (2-7 weekly) kits. For vegan families, there are about four kits per week for up to six people. Who is it best for: I would recommend Green Chef to vegans who want organic food and are looking for four meal kits or fewer per week. These kits would also be good for families of up to six people. Those looking for gluten-free or high-protein kits can also find several options. In terms of eco-friendliness, I appreciated that the meal kits came in paper bags and that additional packaging was labeled with recycling information and a link to nearby drop-off locations. Who should not get it: $12 per serving isn’t cheap, so Green Chef may not be within some people's budgets. It also doesn’t offer the most variety of vegan meal kits per week, but its recipes tasted the best. For more variety, try Purple Carrot, which has about 17 vegan meal kits per week.     ...

Best for vegan smoothies and soups
Splendid Spoon
7.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Vegan and gluten-free
Around 30 vegan options per week
Meals are easy to microwave in minutes
Cons
More expensive at $10-13 per serving
Offers more smoothie and soup options than heartier meals
Free shipping applies only when you buy 10+ units, is otherwise $12.99+
Why we like it: For this testing, I tried Splendid Spoon’s 5-Day Detox, which included a variety of vegan, gluten-free soups, smoothies, dishes and wellness shots. The brand also offers different noodle dishes and bowls. While I did not follow the detox plan, I did try all of the included recipes and would say that Splendid Spoon offers tasty, healthy soups and smoothies for vegans. Senior Home and Kitchen Editor David Watsky thought the same when he tested the service over the past few years. At $10 to $13 per serving, Splendid Spoon offers about 30 vegan options per week, in addition to lower-calorie, lower-fat and lower-sugar meals. The smoothies are preblended, while the soups and dishes simply need to be popped in the microwave. For the soups, you do have to run the cups under warm water for about 30 seconds to defrost. Often, it took me longer than that, or I’d simply leave them out on the counter to defrost. Who is it best for: Splendid Spoon is best for vegans who want a wide variety of soups and smoothies with some noodle dishes or bowls thrown in. If you’re interested in a vegan detox plan this could be good for you but make sure to consult your doctor first. Who should not get it: Splendid Spoon isn’t the most affordable at up to $13 per serving. The brand also doesn’t offer as many noodle dishes or bowls as it does smoothies and soups, which may be a deal-breaker if you prefer heartier meals and aren’t a fan of soup or smoothies. The service also doesn’t offer options for families. Similar to Mosaic Foods, plastic packaging could be separated from the cardboard trays, making it easier to recycle the cardboard. Depending on what your local recycling facility processes, the plastic may require store drop-off.  ... Show more

Best meal kits for flexitarians
Sunbasket
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
8-12 gluten-free meals per week
Mostly organic
Families can get about 2 meals per week up to 4 servings
Cons
Only 1-2 vegan options per week
Can get expensive at up to $18 per serving
Shipping is an extra $10 per box after the first order
Why we like it: As I’m not a flexitarian, I relied on our senior home and kitchen editor’s testing for this one. After testing the service as a meat-eater, he concluded, “If you want vegan meal kits with the occasional meat or fish recipe thrown in, Sunbasket is the best option. The service isn't cheap, but Sunbasket's ingredients are mostly organic, and the weekly menu sports some of the most interesting and inventive recipes of any meal kit service I've tested.”For vegan meal kits specifically, Sunbasket offers one or two meals weekly at $10 to $18 per serving. For families, about two meals are offered for up to four servings. You can also find eight to 12 gluten-free options each week. Who is it best for: Sunbasket would be best for those on a flexitarian or gluten-free diet who are looking to eat healthfully. Who should not get it: I wouldn’t recommend Sunbasket to vegans looking for more than one or two meals per week. The meal kits can also get expensive at up to $18 per serving.   ... Show more

Thistle
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Fresh, pre-made meals
All gluten-free, dairy-free offerings
Some meat options for lunch or dinner
Snacks and desserts offered
Ice pack and delivery bag are reusable for future orders
Delivery as low as $5, but it depends on location
Cons
More expensive at $13-17 per serving
Only delivers to certain areas on the East Coast, West Coast and Chicago metropolitan area
Why we like it: If you’re looking for fresh vegan meals, you can’t go wrong with Thistle. While it can be more pricey at $13 to $17 per serving, the service offers about 18 vegan meals per week for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and snacks. Thistle also has some meat-based lunches and dinners. All of its offerings are gluten- and dairy-free. It delivers once or twice per week, depending on your plan.I also loved that the meals were delivered in a reusable bag with an ice pack that could be returned along with the bag. Out of all the services I tested, this was the only one that offered an ice pack that could be reused for future deliveries. The meals came in recyclable plastic containers.Who is it best for: Thistle is best for vegan, gluten-free eaters or those who want the occasional meat-based protein for lunch or dinner. This would also be the best service for those who prefer fresh, premade meals over frozen. I would also recommend Thistle to those concerned about eco-friendliness and reusability.Who should not get it: Thistle is more of a splurge at $13 to $17 per serving, but you get fresh meals that arrive prepared and ready to eat or be heated up on the stove.  ...

Pros
3-5 vegan meal kits per week for up to six people

Cons
$12 per serving can get pricey
Shipping is $11 after the first order
Why we like it: Like Green Chef, HelloFresh is a straightforward $12 per serving. There are three to five vegan meal kits per week and six to eight vegetarian kits, along with calorie-smart, carb-smart and higher-protein options. For vegan families, HelloFresh offers the most variety out of any service we tested: three to five meals per week for up to six people. Recipes were easy to understand, and all the vegan options were tasty, although they may not be as filling for some. Who is it best for: HelloFresh is best for families of up to six people looking for vegan meal delivery. This service would also be food for vegetarians or those watching their calories or carbs. Who should not get it: HelloFresh may not be in the budget for some, as it costs $12 per serving. For those looking for more than five vegan meal kits per week, Purple Carrot may be a better option, with about 17 vegan kits weekly.   ... Show more

Purple Carrot
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Food is 100% vegan
Unique, interesting recipes
Fresh, high-quality ingredients
Great for learning plant-based cooking basics
Cons
On the expensive side
Few modifications allowed
Limited recipe options per week
Why we like it: Purple Carrot is 100% vegan and offers about 17 meal options per week. Priced at $11 to $13 per serving, there are also about six gluten-free meals and 14 high-protein meals weekly. While this wasn’t my favorite service in terms of how it tasted -- the vegan proteins left a lot to be desired -- I appreciate the wide variety of meals it has and think it would be a great service for anyone who has a gluten-free or high-protein diet. Purple Carrot also has a grocery section for fun add-ons like vegan snacks, cheeses, meats, breakfasts and more.I appreciated that the service provided recycling information and that many of the containers included were easy to reuse for smaller ingredient amounts. Who is it best for: Purple Carrot is best for vegans looking for a wide variety of meals, which can be high-protein or gluten-free. Families can also get up to four servings. For those who want additional vegan groceries along with their meal kits, Purple Carrot’s grocery section is a great option. Who should not get it: At $11 to $13 per serving, these meal kits can add up. I also didn’t love the taste of the meal kits I tested and thought that the recipes could be more thought-out, especially in terms of how the vegan proteins were cooked, so if that is a concern, I would recommend Green Chef instead.  ...

For vegetarians, there are about six meal kits per week, and families can get up to four servings. There are also calorie-, protein- and carb-smart options, but no vegan options or others catering to specific diets.Aside from the ice packs and plastic wrapping, most packaging is recyclable. Plastic wrapping may require store drop-off, depending on what your recycling facility accepts.Who is it best for: EveryPlate would be best for vegetarians and families on a budget who are looking for easy-to-prepare meal kits. Those watching their calories or carbs can also benefit. Who should not get it: This would not be the right service for vegans, gluten-free eaters or vegetarians looking for more than six meals per week.  ...

Best high-protein vegan smoothies
Daily Harvest
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
All dairy- and gluten-free options
$5-10 per serving
Offers high-protein smoothies
Supports Mediterranean, paleo, diabetes-friendly, GLP-1 and Whole30 diets
Cons
Savory meals only include pasta and harvest bowls
Shipping is an extra $10
Why we like it: Everything at Daily Harvest is dairy- and gluten-free, including its premade smoothies, breakfast bowls, bites and savory meals. During my testing, I was able to try several smoothies, two breakfast bowls and bites (essentially a frozen sweet snack or dessert), but did not get a chance to try the savory meals. One was included in my order, but the bag was ripped and spilled in the package. However, for the five meals that offer two servings, they clock in at about $5 per serving, making them the cheapest on this list. Otherwise, you can expect to pay up to $10 per serving for the company’s other offerings. In addition to vegan, Daily Harvest also caters to diabetes-friendly, GLP-1, plant-based, Whole30, Mediterranean and paleo dietary restrictions. Currently, there are 15 plant-based pastas and harvest bowls, 24 smoothies, seven breakfast bowls and four bites available. There is also a specific section for protein, in which there are 17 smoothies and breakfast bowls, but three smoothies specifically dedicated to higher plant-based protein at 20 grams per serving. Who is it best for: I recommend Daily Harvest to people who are vegan and gluten-free, looking for smoothies they simply have to add liquid to and blend or premade savory meals. This brand is also a great option for those looking for premade smoothies with extra protein. Or, you can purchase its 15-serving organic pea protein powder separately for $45 and add one scoop of it to your other nonprotein smoothies for an additional 24 grams of protein. At $5 to $10, Daily Harvest is the most affordable prepared vegan meal delivery service on this list, so it would be great for anyone on a budget. Who should not get it: I wouldn’t recommend Daily Harvest for those who want more than smoothies, breakfast bowls, harvest bowls or pasta. If you have a higher budget and still want prepared vegan meals, you may want to consider Mosaic Foods. Splendid Spoon could also be good for vegan soups or smoothies.   ... Show more

Anna Gragert/CNETWhat to consider for vegan meal delivery services
When trying to find a vegan meal delivery service, several factors should be considered to find your perfect fit. Prepared meals versus meal kits: Prepared meals come ready to heat in the microwave or in a pan on the stovetop. Meal kits, on the other hand, provide all the ingredients and instructions you’ll need to prepare the meals yourself. Though prepared meals are easier and take less time, meal kits may be good for those who like cooking or want to learn to cook.Fresh versus frozen: On this list, we only have one meal delivery service that offers fresh meals you keep in the fridge for eating or heating: Thistle. All other prepared meal delivery services offer preprepared meals that are frozen.
Anna Gragert/CNETDietary restrictions: If you have certain dietary restrictions, you’ll want to ensure that the service you choose caters to all of them. Some services are strictly vegan, while others are vegetarian. If you’re gluten-free, counting calories or carbs or want high-protein meals, those are also factors you should consider. Cost: Out of the services tested for this list, costs range from $6 to $18 per serving. Before choosing a meal delivery service, you will want to determine your budget and what you're willing to pay for time saved and convenience. Also, are you willing to pay more for meals that are already prepared versus meal kits you make yourself?Variety: Depending on your diet, only a certain number of meals may be offered per week. Each meal delivery service should allow you to view its menus a few weeks in advance, so you can take a look at how many meals you’ll have to choose from. If you plan to rely on this service for most of your meals, you’ll want to ensure it caters to your specific diet with a wider variety of dishes.Number of servings: If you’re looking for a meal delivery service for a couple or family, check to see how many servings are offered. Meal kits are likely to offer a greater number of servings (around four to six), while prepared meals are better suited toward individuals.
Anna Gragert/CNET How we test vegan meal delivery services
We tested all of these vegan meal kits and prepared meal delivery services over the course of several months, preparing and eating each recipe to check for taste, recipe difficulty and clarity, packaging, time spent and quality of ingredients. At the same time, we also compared each service’s cost per serving, available diets, number of meals offered per week for vegans or vegetarians and whether meals for families are offered.

A vegan diet can be healthy, but only if you’re getting all the nutrients your body needs.
