Can’t find great meat at your local grocery store? You’re not alone. Premium cuts can be hit-or-miss at supermarkets, and when you do find them, they often come with a hefty price tag. That’s where meat delivery services come in. These subscription boxes and online butchers deliver high-quality beef, chicken, pork and more straight to your doorstep -- sometimes at better prices than your neighborhood store.

Rastelli's
Best meat delivery overall
Rastelli's
Pros
Great weekly specials
Meat is high-quality and always arrives looking fresh
Selection is well curated
Cons
Beef can be expensive
No subscription option
What I liked: Rastelli's started out as a small butcher shop in New Jersey serving its local community, but it's always put a premium on the best meat possible and is driven by a love of good food. Prices vary depending on which butcher box you choose, and there are many options, including steak craft burgers, hardwood smoked bacon or grass-fed filet mignon. You can buy any curated box as a one-off meat delivery service purchase but will save if you subscribe.Who is it for:Those who want quality beef that's a step up from most store-bought. Today it ships beef, poultry and seafood across the US from farms that produce responsibly raised meats free of antibiotics, steroids and hormones. It also sources wild-caught and sustainably raised seafood like Faroe Island salmon.Who should avoid it: Rastelli's gives a good amount of information on each product but it's not exhaustive, for better or worse. You can read about where the market sources most of its meats, but the information is a bit general. If you're extremely meticulous about knowing the exact farm and farming practices associated with your meat, there are other delivery services that go a little further.  ... Show more

Butcher Box
Best meat subscription
ButcherBox
Pros
Excellent value if you already eat grass-fed beef, organic chicken and wild salmon
Eco-friendly packaging
Sign-up offers are great
Cons
Subscription only
Can't choose what comes in your box
What I liked:ButcherBox is a meat subscription service that offers a few types of meat but puts an emphasis on its 100% grass-fed and pasture-raised Australian beef. Grass-fed beef is said to be higher in antioxidants, vitamins and healthy fatty acids since it's pastured and its meat products are not raised on feedlots. Some say grass-fed has a purer beefy taste too. Australian beef is some of the most highly regulated in the world.The company also offers heritage breed pork from pigs with plentiful outdoor access and an all-vegetarian diet from forage and feed, and free-range, organic chicken that's humanely raised, with no antibiotics or added hormones. It makes a point of mentioning that it works with "the best possible meat processing facilities" and believes in fair labor practices too.All of the meat is vacuum-packed and frozen, and shipping is free.Who is it for: Those who eat enough meat to warrant a subscription but want to save over grocery store prices. Butcher Box starts at $146 a month. I compared this to what it would cost to buy meat from the grocery store and the supermarket tally was $30 more. As a bonus, the company is usually running some sort of promotion, like free bacon for the life of your subscription or a huge surplus of free meat in your first shipment.Who should avoid it:If you don't mind getting a surprise mix of meats in each delivery, ButcherBox is a great deal. When you sign up with this online butcher, you can choose from all beef, beef and chicken, beef and pork, a mixed box or create a custom box. In any case, you select from two different box sizes depending on how many people you're feeding (or how big your freezer is). If you want complete control, it'll cost you. The Custom Box is $169 a month but allows you to take your pick of over 20 different cuts including ground beef, top sirloin steaks, strip steaks, chuck roast, pork tenderloin, boneless pork chops, chicken breasts and drumsticks.

Best meat delivery to gift
Porter Road
Pros
Sends mostly fresh meat, not frozen
Sources from small farms and independent producers
Small but carefully curated selection
Cons
Shipping is more expensive for those on the West Coast
Items frequently sell out
Why I liked it:Based in Nashville, Porter Road offers a variety of cuts of prime beef, pork, lamb and chicken, sourced from Kentucky and Tennessee. Its beef is pasture-raised, grass-fed and grain-finished, but the company uses no added hormones or antibiotics and the animals are free to roam and graze. It's largely a subscription model, but you can order a la carte cuts including pork chops, NY strip steaks, filet mignon, ribeye and ground beef, to less common cuts like Denver steak, lamb T-bones and andouille sausage. You can also add items to your meat subscription. ("Put a bird on it" if you'd like to have chicken next week.)Who is it for:Those who want quality fresh meat. Most of the company's meat is shipped fresh, but depending on the cut, some will be frozen. Who should avoid it:Subscriptions start at $155. You'll get less meat than with ButcherBox's entry-level subscription but the quality is higher for many of the cuts. Specialty selections include the Breakfast Box and a Grilling Heroes Box ($110) with dry-aged steaks, dry-aged burger patties and bratwurst sausage links, with 6 pounds of meat.  ... Show more

Snake River Farms
Best Wagyu meat delivery
Snake River Farms
Pros
Huge selection of Prime and Wagyu beef and Kurobuta pork
Free shipping on orders over $199
Seafood available to add to order
Cons
Meat is pricey
No subscription option
What I liked:Snake River Farms meat delivery service (and its partner, Double R Ranch) offer something special: Not only dry-aged, USDA Prime beef but American Wagyu (Kobe-style) beef, known for its rich marbling, tender texture and fantastic flavor. All Snake River Farm cows are raised sustainably and humanely in the Northwest, and it offers heritage breed Kurobuta Berkshire pork from pigs raised on small family farms in Idaho and the Midwest.In addition to its exclusive (and accordingly expensive), chef-approved cuts of rare steak, it touts several sustainable ranching practices, from rotational grazing that promotes healthy rangelands to composting cattle waste and using beef tallow for fuel. Even the shipping foam in each butcher box can be dissolved and used as plant food, composted or used as a fire starter. In addition, the meat products company is a founding member of Beef Counts, which helps provide food to families in need.Who is it for:If you've come to Snake River, you're there for the Wagyu. While the company doesn't offer recurring meat delivery service subscriptions, you can buy all sorts of individual cuts like American Wagyu black grade cap and ribeye (prices vary), not to mention Wagyu burgers and hot dogs. Plus, Snake River has Kurobuta pork bacon and baby back ribs if it's pork you're after. Who should avoid it:Those seeking budget-friendly meat. Most Wagyu products are offered in both Gold Grade (the highest quality -- and price -- available) and Black Grade (still special but slightly less devastating to the wallet). As with most other meat delivery services, your cuts will come vacuum-sealed and frozen. Shipping costs $10 for standard shipping or $50 for rush shipping, or you can get free standard shipping on orders over $199.  ... Show more

Crowd Cow
Best meat delivery service for deals
Crowd Cow
Pros
Recurring boxes and subscriptions can be customized
Huge selection of meat and seafood
Members get better prices
Cons
Not as much transparency about souring
$99 order minimum
Paid membership required for best prices
Options can be overwhelming
What I like:Crowd Cow aims to "create an alternative to the current meat commodity system" by connecting consumers to quality meat from a carefully curated selection of small farms and independent ranches around the world. The specific offerings range from grass-fed beef and both Japanese and American Wagyu to pork, chicken and American-raised lamb (bison is a recent addition). There's even a grocery store selection of sustainable seafood for those craving surf and turf. You have the option to search by specific cut or type of meat or by the actual farm itself.No matter what meat box or seafood selection you choose, your haul arrives frozen and packaged in 100% recyclable and compostable materials. And it includes information on which farm it came from, making this a perfect option for those seeking transparency in addition to delicious meat.Who is it for:Customers who want the option for a subscription but also to purchase items a la carte, including organic, free-range chicken, bone-in pork chops or grass-fed ground beef. You can set your order to recurring and it'll ship monthly. You can then modify it whenever you like. Who should avoid it:Those who prefer a simpler subscription. Crowd Cow has an expansive offering with hundreds of meat and seafood offerings.

Holy Grail Steak Co.
Pros
Large selection of premium cuts

Cons
Very expensive
Limited selection
What I like:The newcomer to the high-end meat delivery game sells the best American-raised Wagyu with a deep portfolio of top A5-grade Japanese Wagyu producers on the planet. This includes ultrarare Hokkaido snow beef and beloved Kobe beef. On the website, you can sift through "collections" such as Japanese Wagyu, American Wagyu, USDA Prime Black Angus, Akaushi, steak flights and Wagyu burgers.You can order one-time boxes or custom orders for yourself or choose from carefully curated beef boxes to send as a gift or care package. Enjoy free ground shipping when you spend more than $199 (not hard to do).Who is it for:If you're looking for the very best in beef and have a few extra pennies to spend on the good stuff.Who should avoid it:Budget shoppers. Holy Grail does sport an impressive menu, but it ain't cheap. Your best meat box bet here is buying in bulk versus purchasing in smaller quantities, which is much pricier.

Best for ordering meat and groceries
Thrive Market
Pros
Budget-friendly prices
Offers full inventory of groceries, not just meat
Good customer service
Cons
Membership required
Meat sold in large quantities
What I like:Online grocery provider Thrive Market is also a one-stop shop, in a somewhat more traditional sense: The grocery store sells all manner of organic, 100% non-GMO, fair-trade products at wholesale prices, so you can buy various brands of things like paper towels, marinades and snacks, along with bundled boxes of meat and seafood.The company's meat delivery options are many and include 100% grass-fed, free-range beef from small and midsize, family-run ranches and farms, pasture-raised chicken with organic options and wild-caught seafood. You can bundle and save with Thrive's Paleo Box with as much as 20 servings of mixed meat and seafood for $136.Who is it for:Those looking for an online source for meat and other groceries. Who should avoid it:Subscription-phobes.To shop from the site, you must pay a $60 annual membership fee (which nets you guaranteed savings and free gifts, plus sponsors a free membership for a low-income family), but you can sign up for a 30-day free trial to test it out first. The company guarantees you'll make back your membership in savings every year, but if not, will give you store credit for the difference.  ... Show more

Omaha Steaks

Omaha Steaks
Best for discount meat bundles
Omaha Steaks
Pros
Good deals on large orders
Bundles with sides and desserts available
Great for gifting
Cons
Meat is not as high-quality as others on our list
Website isn't the best
Prepared sides and dishes are just OK
A lot of salt used
Omaha Steaks bills itself as "America's Original Butcher" and has certainly been in the carnivore-feeding business for a long time. Keeping up with the growing preference for grass-fed beef, both grain- and grass-fed are now offered (both options start with grass-fed but the signature beef is grain-finished).Omaha is solid but it's not where I'd turn for super high-end cuts. The company doesn't advertise organic meat as many others do, nor provide much specific information about how and where the animals are raised. But the range of items available is somewhat staggering. From various cuts of beef (steak galore, including cuts as big as 48 ounces) and some harder-to-find cuts of bison, veal and lamb. Omaha also stocks plenty of pork, chicken and seafood as well as charcuterie, full meal kits, a la carte side dishes and desserts and even dog treats.You can find some pretty good value with this online butcher, especially if you're willing to buy in bulk. While Omaha doesn't offer subscriptions by name, there are plenty of gift boxes that will net you a whole lot of meat for an approachable price. There are also rotating discounts on some of Omaha's best sellers. Shipping prices vary based on order total and how fast you want your stuff, but you can find some "free shipping" deals and combos on the site. There's also a Steaklover Reward Points program for committed carnivores.  ... Show more

Best budget-friendly meat subscription
Good Chop
Pros
One of the most affordable meat delivery service
Most of whar we tried was fresh and easy to prepare
Some prepared foods and grocery add-ons
Good promo offers for new subscribers
Cons
Not as big a selection as some of the options on our list
No super premium selections
Ribeye was dissappointing
What I liked:Good Chop is a newer meat delivery operation owned by HelloFresh and a direct competitor to ButcherBox. It's also one of the more affordable. Subscriptions start at $149 a month for 36 portions of meat and seafood. While the meat here isn't quite as premium as others on our list, nearly everything we tasted was fresh, tender and easy to prepare. You can customize your meat box with chicken breast, sausages, salmon, pork chops, shrimp and lots and lots of juicy cuts of beef. There are also a few prepared foods including crab cakes, meatballs and cooked chicken for meal prep, though I didn't try any of those.Who is it for:Those looking to have shipments of meat delivered without breaking the bank.Who should avoid it:The ribeye in my order was tough. Not a good pick if you're seeking super premium meat.

Best meat to gift
Peter Luger
Pros
Top-quality steak from a legendary steakhouse
Includes a bottle of Peter Luger sauce
Makes a great gift
Cons
Very expensive
Limited options
What I like:The iconic Brooklyn steakhouse known for fatty t-bones, juicy burgers and a signature sweet steak sauce now send its beef to you or a giftee with a penchant for premium beef. The bundles of beef include porterhouse, strip and rib steaks along with burgers. Each shipment arrives fresh, accompanied by a bottle of legendary Lugar steak sauce. The porterhouse we tried arrived with intense marbleization and was a whopping 36 ounces. You can add some of the restaurant's famous thick-cut bacon or an extra three-pack of sauce for $20. Who is it for:A true beef fanatic or ex-New Yorkers who misses their beloved New York steakhouse.Who should avoid it:At $156 for one 36-ounce porterhouse, this is best saved for a splurge gift for a meat eater with fondness for the lauaded steakhouse.

Best for ribeyes
Eagle Rock Ranch
Pros
Best ribeyes we tested
All its beef products were great
Family-owned business
Cattle is pasture-raised
Cons
Limited to just beef
Shipping is $49
What I liked:While the selection is limited to only beef at family-owned Eagle Rock Ranch out of Colorado, the pasture-raised and grain-finished ribeyes were some of the best out of all the meat delivery options I tried. Juicy, tender, marbled and fairly priced considering the quality -- $38 for a 16-ounce cut and. In addition to the ribeyes, Eagle Rock sells strips, burgers, marrow, beef hot dogs and filet mignon and stew meat. There's a subscription option or you can build a box of beef or choose from one of two curated bundles of cuts. If you're really hungry, you can order a whole beef package that includes 425 to 450 pounds of packaged meat.Who is it for:Lovers of quality beef, especially tender ribeye steaks. Who should avoid it:Anyone who wants a mix of meat types in their order, since this vendor sells only beef.  ... Show more

We consider every angle from quality and taste to convenience and value when testing meat delivery services and subscriptions. annick vanderschelden photography/Getty ImagesTesting meat delivery services starts by scanning a website's online menus and subscription options. We then choose a popular bundle box or subscription to order and wait for it to arrive. Upon arrival, we examine the shipping containers for structural integrity, including any leaks or meat that's been defrosted during Transit. If meat is shipped Frozen, we expect it to arrive Frozen, and if it's shipped fresh, we make sure it's still chilled.We defrost the meat, if necessary, according to instructions to gauge the visual quality of both meat and seafood. We then cook each cut according to instructions if they are given and taste the finished product before deciding if a meat delivery service is qualified to be on our list.
Testing quality meat to find the best delivery services is one task we're happy to take on. David Watsky/CNETMore abstractly, we compare the prices of any one we deliver to the category at large and grocery store averages to consider overall value.
