There are pros and cons to consuming apple cider vinegar. Anna Gragert/CNET
If you've ever considered drinking apple cider vinegar (ACV), like many wellness influencers online, it's important that you don't just drink it straight without knowing what you're doing or why. To provide necessary context to this popular beverage, we consulted experts and did the research to inform you about the potential health benefits and unwanted side effects that can come with a shot of ACV. Bragg Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar
$7 at Amazon
What is apple cider vinegar or ACV?When you combine apples, sugar and yeast and allow it to ferment, it creates apple cider vinegar. Over several weeks, the yeast will digest the sugar to make alcohol. Once this happens, natural bacteria will turn the alcohol into acetic acid, which gives apple cider vinegar its pungent odor and taste.You have two options when you buy apple cider vinegar: filtered and pasteurized, or raw and unfiltered. The cloudy sediment that collects in the bottom of the bottle is "the mother," which is a combination of bacteria and yeast. Some speculate that the mother is what provides the health benefits, as it contains trace amounts of healthy bacteria and probiotics.Apple cider vinegar can be used in the kitchen, around the home and for your health as a:CleanerDandruff treatmentDenture cleanerDeodorizerDressing or vinaigretteFacial tonerFruit and vegetable washHair rinseMarinadeMouthwashPreservativeWeed killer
Anna Gragert/CNET4 potential apple cider vinegar health benefitsAlthough more research is needed, several small and medium-sized studies show the benefits of apple cider vinegar for some health issues and as a potential weight loss aid.1. May help control blood sugar and diabetesUp to 95% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Type 2 diabetes occurs from insulin resistance, which is "when cells in the body don't respond properly to insulin, which leads to increased levels of sugar or glucose in the blood," according to Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in NYC.Even if you don't have diabetes, it's best to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. Studies have shown that apple cider vinegar can improve insulin response and lower blood sugar levels after meals.Consuming apple cider vinegar before going to sleep has also been shown to reduce fasting blood sugar after waking. Make sure to talk with your doctor before consuming ACV if you have diabetes, especially if you're on medication because of potential side effects."ACV alone will not lower blood sugar levels and should not be considered a substitute for diabetes medications," Ti said. 2. Kills harmful bacteria
Those looking to preserve food naturally may want to consider using apple cider vinegar. It is a known pathogen killer, which includes microbes like staph and candida.Vinegar is a popular preservative in Korea because it can prevent E. coli and norovirus from growing in food. E. coli can cause food poisoning when consumed but the bactericidal effects of the acetic acid in apple cider vinegar can prevent it from occurring.3. Could lead to weight lossAnother benefit of apple cider vinegar that may be useful is its ability to help with weight loss. When taken before or during a meal, ACV has been shown to help with satiety (the feeling of fullness).In one study, participants ate approximately 200 to 275 fewer calories when apple cider vinegar was combined with a meal. In three months, participants taking one to two tablespoons of ACV per day saw up to 3.7 pounds in weight loss and a reduction in body fat.4. Might improve cholesterol levelsHigh cholesterol and triglyceride levels can increase your risk of heart disease.Incorporating up to an ounce of apple cider vinegar into your day, along with a lower-calorie diet, may reduce total cholesterol and triglycerides while also increasing HDL "good" cholesterol.Those with type 2 diabetes may also see positive results on their total cholesterol and triglyceride levels when adding a half ounce of ACV to their diet.Drinking apple cider vinegar may cause these side effectsAlthough apple cider vinegar has benefits, there are also potential side effects to consider. The high acidity can strip tooth enamel, which won't come back once it's gone. If you drink it undiluted, it may damage your esophagus or throat.Here are some other potential side effects of apple cider vinegar:Can cause esophageal (throat) burns or ulcers when consumed in excess Can cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels)Can cause nausea or vomitingCan interact with diuretics, insulin and other medicationsCan weaken tooth enamel Watering it down with water or juice not only makes ACV more palatable, but it can also reduce the risk of damaging your throat and teeth. Combining one or two tablespoons with either may also cure an upset stomach.Marisa Moore, a registered dietitian nutritionist, also advises, "It's important to remember that no one food is a silver bullet. If you choose to incorporate apple cider vinegar, do so safely and with a focus on maintaining a balanced, whole diet for your overall health and well-being."How much apple cider vinegar should you drink daily? Apple cider vinegar dosage depends on the reason you're using it. In general, Ti says, "I recommend 1 teaspoon to tablespoon ACV diluted in 6-8 ounces of warm water before meals."If you want to drink it, dilute it with water or your favorite juice or tea. You can also eat it by incorporating it in your favorite foods, especially dressings, vinaigrettes and even when making your own mayonnaise.Premade apple cider vinegar drinks, which may make ACV more pleasant to taste, are also available. These drinks are made by brands such as Bragg, Poppi, Remedy and Sidekick Sodas. Local health stores and even grocery stores may carry them, so keep an eye out if you're interested.You can also add a cup or two to a bath for skin issues. Mixing a tablespoon of ACV with a cup of water, and then soaking gauze or cotton in the solution can make a wet wrap.To use apple cider vinegar as a hair rinse, combine up to two tablespoons with a cup of water, then pour over the hair after shampooing. Wait five minutes, then rinse. It can be drying, so use it sparingly. ACV can also irritate the scalp, so a weaker dilution may be better.
Annick Vanderschelden/Moment/Getty ImagesThe bottom lineSome studies have found the benefits of apple cider vinegar, but we need more research to definitively prove how beneficial it is. It may help with weight loss, controlling type 2 diabetes, blood sugar and cholesterol, and it can also prevent harmful bacteria growth on foods. Drinking undiluted apple cider vinegar can cause tooth enamel erosion or throat damage. Mixing ACV with water or juice before consuming it can prevent damage to the teeth and throat. As with any natural remedy, speak with your doctor before trying apple cider vinegar and do a skin test before using it on your skin."Remember that the advantages of adopting an overall healthy lifestyle (e.g., nutritious and balanced diet, adequate hydration, regular physical activity/movement, good sleep, stress management, etc.) are far greater than those of any single food, drink or supplement," Ti said. "There is no quick fix, and ACV is definitely not a miracle solution."
