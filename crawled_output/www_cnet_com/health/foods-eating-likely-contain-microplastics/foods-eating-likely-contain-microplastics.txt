Cutting single-use plastic containers and utensils also lowers your long-term exposure. Javier Zayas Photography/Getty Images
Whether it's in food storage or kitchen tools, microplastics are everywhere in our kitchens -- and, unfortunately, that includes in the food we eat. In fact, it's been estimated that Americans consume between 39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles annually. They come from our environment, food packaging or additives that make their way into our diets. To find out which foods are most likely to contain microplastics, and how they affect our health, we spoke with a family physician. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Best Cookware Sets

How many microplastics are too many?"There is no officially established 'safe' or 'unsafe' level of microplastic intake. It makes sense to want your exposure to be as low as possible," Dr. Joseph Mercola, a board-certified family medicine osteopathic physician, said in an email.  Microplastics can enter our food because of contamination where the food was grown, raised or processed. Mercola explained that using plastic mulch and plastic seed coatings in agriculture, and irrigation with contaminated water, are among the various ways microplastics can end up in food. Plastic packaging, utensils and containers are additional sources.  According to the US Food and Drug Administration, current evidence doesn't suggest that the levels of microplastics in food are a risk to us. However, you still might want to minimize how much microplastics you passively consume. These are the most common foods that contain microplastics, and the measures you can adopt to reduce your plastic intake.
Top 8 foods in your diet that contain microplastics 1. Seafood One of the most significant ways plastic particles end up in our food is through single-use plastics that break down and find their way into waterways and soil. When they reach the oceans, they end up in our seafood. "Microplastics are then taken up by plankton and mistaken for food by fish and shellfish," Mercola said. "The tiny particles accumulate in the flesh ... then end up on our plates." A recent study published by Portland State University discovered a variety of microplastics in 180 out of 182 tested seafood samples. Microfibers are the most common type of microplastic present, but this isn't the only type that ends up in our oceans. How to avoid it: While you can't control how many microplastics your fish ate before it got to your plate, you can reduce the amount of filter feeders and bottom feeders you choose to eat (e.g., clams, mussels, oysters, catfish, halibut, flounder and cod). These types of seafood are exposed to higher amounts of microplastics. Also, choose seafood at the store that uses sustainable packaging, not plastic wrap.
Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images2. Tea bags Polypropylene is often used to make tea bags, and even if you choose paper tea bags, they can still contain microplastics. The issue is that when the bags contact hot water, microplastics may be released into your tea.  Researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered that polypropylene tea bags can release plastic particles in the billions, and nylon and cellulose tea bags can release them in the millions. How to avoid it: You don't have to stop drinking tea. Switch to loose-leaf tea and invest in a stainless steel diffuser to enjoy your tea free of microplastics. 3. Rice Rice is also a hotspot for microplastics. A University of Queensland study found that for every half cup of rice, there are 3 to 4 milligrams of plastic. If you use instant rice packets, that number is four times higher, at 13 milligrams. How to avoid it: The study found that washing your rice can reduce plastic contamination by 20% to 40%, though it's worth noting that the study used filtered water for rinsing. 4. Salt and sugar When you top off your dinner with a sprinkling of salt, you're getting an unintentional side of microplastics. It's hard to outrun salt. It's in almost everything we eat and our bodies need a certain amount of sodium to keep our fluids and electrolytes balanced. One study found that 90% of the 39 sampled salt brands worldwide contained microplastics. This likely results from environmental contamination and the production and packaging process, which includes plastic. Microplastics have also been found in sugar. How to avoid it: To reduce your exposure to microplastics in your salt and sugar, you can buy them packaged in glass or cardboard.
Yuliia Kokosha/Getty Images5. Bottled water Bottled water is one of the most well-known sources of micro and nanoplastics. One study estimated that there are about 240,000 plastic particulates in a liter of bottled water. Most plastic water bottles you buy at the store are made from polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic, so it wasn't surprising to see it represented. Plastic particles break apart when bottles are squeezed or exposed to heat. And PET plastic isn't the only type of nanoplastic researchers have found in plastic water bottles. How to avoid it: Drinking tap water from a stainless steel or glass container can reduce your risk of ingesting plastic particles. Klean Kanteen Insulated Water Bottle

6. Honey You might not expect your honey to harbor microplastics, but it does, even if it's in a glass jar. Microplastic fibers can be traced back to bees and pollution. One study exploring whether microplastics ingested or carried by honeybees were then incorporated into hives found that bees can continue the dispersal of microplastics through honey. How to avoid it: Buying honey from local beekeepers who often use more natural and sustainable harvesting methods may reduce the risk of microplastic contamination. 7. Fruits and veggies Vegetables and fruits are an essential part of a balanced diet. They can also contain microplastics. One study that sampled fruit and vegetables found that apples were the most contaminated fruit and carrots were the most contaminated vegetable. How does this happen? "Plants have been shown to uptake micro- and nanoplastics from soil through their root systems, contaminating the edible portions," Mercola said. Many grocery stores also package fruit and vegetables in plastic to keep them fresh. According to the FDA, there isn't enough evidence to determine that microplastics from plastic food packaging migrate into food. But Mercola suggests you avoid it as much as you can anyway. How to avoid it: Wash your fruit thoroughly, peel when possible and choose local or organic produce.
Animaflora/Getty Images8. Proteins A recent study from researchers at the Ocean Conservancy found that 88% of vegetable and animal proteins contain some level of microplastics. But highly processed proteins, like plant-based alternatives, fish sticks or chicken nuggets, harbor the most microplastics, suggesting the microplastic contamination partly comes from food processing. The study found that breaded shrimp had an average of 300 microplastic pieces per serving. Plant-based nuggets had 100 pieces per serving. Food processing isn't the only way microplastics can get into these protein sources. Microplastics are in animal feeds and in the environments where animals are raised. Plant-based alternatives can be contaminated through the soil or irrigation.  How to avoid it: After reading that, you may wonder what protein you should eat. The reality is that more research is needed to know the exact levels and their impact on our health. Our bodies need protein to function, so getting enough is important, regardless of your chosen source. Read more: An Easy Protein Visual Guide to Help You Reach Maximum Muscle Gains What do microplastics in food mean for you? So, do all foods contain microplastics? I can't say for sure. I can tell you, however, that more research is needed to understand just how eating foods with microplastics affects us. Still, although the long-term health effects remain under investigation, microplastics are something to watch out for and guard against if you can, as Mercola explained. "Ingested microplastics have been found to accumulate in the circulatory system and various organs, including the brain, where they can cause inflammation and tissue damage," Mercola said. Other potential side effects are hormonal imbalances caused by the endocrine-disrupting chemicals found in plastics. Microplastics can also absorb other environmental toxins and introduce them into the body. There's no established safe level of microplastics and we can't completely outrun them: They're everywhere and in everything. But it's a good idea to minimize exposure where you can. Expert tips for reducing your intake of microplasticsYou can cut down by following this advice:1. Be careful how much shellfish you eatShellfish like mussels, oysters and scallops have higher levels of microplastics, so don't overdo it.2. Avoid food-storage containers made of plasticThis is one of Mercola's biggest suggestions because of the "plasticizing chemicals" in plastic. BPA and phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can transfer from plastic to food. They're fat-soluble, so this happens most easily with fatty foods. It's best to store foods with fat in glass containers, but you can store dry foods in plastic if you need to. 3. Avoid plastic-wrapped foodsThis can be easier said than done but it's something to strive for in areas where you can switch. 4. Get rid of plastic kitchen utensilsFrom the spoons we use to stir our sauces to the cutting boards we use to chop our vegetables, if they're plastic, you're ingesting microplastics. A good rule of thumb is: Anything plastic that comes in contact with your food should be swapped out for ceramic, glass, stainless steel or wood.To help address the overall issue of microplastics, you can install a filter in your clothes-washing machine. If you can afford it, a special filter will catch microfibers before they pollute water systems. The PlanetCare 2.0 microfiber filter starts at $125. We still have a lot to learn about microplastics and their long-term implications for our health when ingested. It might be hard to hear they're in so many of our foods but that shouldn't deter you from eating well. A balanced diet of protein, fruit and vegetables will ensure your body has enough fuel to function and thrive -- microplastics or not.Is there a water filter that removes microplastics?While there is a wide variety of water filters on the market, Lifestraw is one of the few brands that targets microplastics in drinking water. The brand claims that its membrane microfilter removes 99.999% of microplastics as well as well as bacteria and parasites. If you're looking for a water filter that will remove microplastics, look for water filter pitchers and bottles that specifically mention microplastics or choose a whole-home water filtration system.
