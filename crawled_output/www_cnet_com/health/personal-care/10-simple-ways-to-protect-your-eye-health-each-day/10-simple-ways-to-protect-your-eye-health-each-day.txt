You only get one set of eyes, so protect them properly.
Anastassiya Bezhekeneva/Getty Images
Summer's bright and sunny days have come and gone but you still need to protect your eyes from the danger of UV rays. People are used to slathering on sunscreen to protect their skin, but what about protecting your eyes? We only get one pair of eyes, but protecting them isn't always top of mind. From overuse to UV rays, our eyes are at risk of damage every day. Thankfully, there are plenty of easy ways to help keep them healthy.
1. Wear sunglasses to block UV lightExposing your eyes to ultraviolet rays may cause damage over time. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, wearing sunglasses can block harmful UV light, lowering your risk of eye diseases like cataracts, sunburn, eye cancer and growths around the eye. Polarized glasses with smoke or gray lenses may offer the best protection against the sun's rays and reduce glare.Warby Parker Sunglasses

Take screen breaks every 20 minutesProlonged screen time can cause dry eyes, pain in the neck and shoulders, blurred vision, headaches and digital eye strain, or computer vision syndrome. The American Optometric Association recommends using the 20-20-20 rule to prevent computer vision syndrome. Every 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away for 20 seconds.3. Take book breaks, tooScreen time isn't the only way to strain your eyes. You probably hold a book up close for long periods when you read it. Both activities can lead to nearsightedness, or myopia, which means faraway objects are blurry, while up-close objects are clear. Just like you should use the 20-20-20 rule to take screen breaks, you should also use this rule for book breaks. If you find yourself engrossed in what you're reading or doing on the computer, set an alarm so you don't miss your breaks.
Science Library/Getty Images4. Move your body for both overall and eye healthRegular exercise can provide eye health benefits, such as promoting healthy blood vessels and lowering your risk of developing glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, the American Academy of Ophthalmology reports. The CDC recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every week, plus two days of strength training for your muscles. You can also practice eye exercises to reduce tension and eye strain while sitting at your desk.Read more: 7 Fitness Hacks to Sneak in Exercise Painlessly Every Day5. Get outside as much as possibleChildren and adults need to get outside often, even if they get their recommended exercise indoors. Research shows that children who spend time outdoors have a lower risk of developing nearsightedness in adolescence and as adults. Playing with your kids at the local playground, walking through the woods or even playing in the backyard can help the whole family stay healthy and active. Be sure to use your sunglasses.6. Quit smokingIt's well known that smoking is bad for your health. It can also increase your risk of developing eye diseases like cataracts or age-related macular degeneration, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Smokers have a two- or three-times higher chance of developing cataracts and up to four times higher risk for AMD. Future research may determine if smoking cigarettes can also cause glaucoma, Graves' eye disease, thyroid eye disease and encourage diabetic retinopathy onset or progression. To improve your health, build a quit plan.
Getty Images7. Eat balanced meals rich in vitaminsThe foods you eat every day can improve your eye health. Eating foods rich in vitamins A, C and E, beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, zeaxanthin and zinc can help cellular growth, lower eye tissue inflammation and limit free radicals that can damage your eyes.To get the right nutrients for your eyes, eat balanced meals by including some of these foods in your regular diet, as recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology:Vitamin A and beta-carotene: Apricots, carrots, cantaloupe, sweet potatoes, red pepper, ricotta cheese, mangoVitamin C: Grapefruit, oranges, lemons, tangerines, peaches, strawberries, tomatoes, red bell pepperVitamin E: Avocados, almonds, peanut butter, wheat germ, sunflower seedsOmega-3: Halibut, sardines, salmon, tuna, troutLutein and Zeaxanthin: Collards, broccoli, eggs, peas, kale, spinach, romaine lettuce, turnip greensZinc: Lima beans, kidney beans, black-eyed peas, lean red meats, oysters, fortified cereals, poultryRead more: Best Vitamins and Supplements for Eye Health8. Avoid rubbing your eyesHabitually rubbing your eyes could cause eye damage or infections. Dry eyes and eye strain can make you want to rub your eyes, and some may rub them too much or too hard. This can lead to issues such as reduced or blurry vision, headaches, inflammation and eye and light sensitivity. Another reason to avoid eye rubbing is that bacteria or viruses on your fingers or hands could lead to conjunctivitis, commonly called pink eye. Instead of rubbing your eyes, use eye drops or saline to clean your eyes and keep them moist. Resist the urge and find something else to keep your hands busy until you undo the habit.9. Wash your hands before touching your face or eyesYou should always wash your hands before touching your face or eyes and handling contact lenses. Almost 45 million Americans wear contact lenses, and around one in three wearers develop complications, with one in five infections from contact lenses causing corneal damage.Plus, there's no telling what germs might have already contaminated an object you've touched. The CDC reports that washing your hands regularly can lower your risk of respiratory illness by up to 20% and diarrheal illness by up to 30%. The Best Places to Buy Contact Lenses Online

10. Take off your makeup at the end of the dayAfter a long day, the last thing you might think about is removing your eye makeup before you get into bed. Doing so benefits your eye health and can lower your risk of blepharitis or eyelid inflammation, according to the Optometrists Network.You should also adopt good makeup practices that can save your skin and eyes, such as only using products made for eyes, replacing your makeup often (especially after an eye infection), not applying eye makeup in the inner lids and never sharing eye makeup. If you use brushes or sponges to apply eye makeup, wash them regularly.
