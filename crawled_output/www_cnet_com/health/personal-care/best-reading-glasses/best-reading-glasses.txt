If you've been having trouble reading your phone's screen up close, you may have presbyopia. According to Dr. Steven Reed, president of the American Optometric Association, presbyopia, or trouble seeing nearby objects, is a common age-related condition that typically starts in your 40s. Fortunately, reading glasses can help and don't require a prescription.

Warby Parker
Pros

Has both a virtual and at-home try-on service
Offers virtual prescription renewal for certain states
Has about 300 brick-and-mortar stores
Cons
Cost starts at $95
Doesn’t offer strengths above +2.75
Why we like it: Warby Parker offers 312 frames for reading glasses. Powers range from +0.25 to +2.75, prices range from $95 to $195 and there is both a virtual and home try-on service. You can even use the brand’s virtual prescription renewal if you live in certain states. However, prescriptions are not usually required for readers. The brand also has almost 300 brick-and-mortar stores in the US where you can try on glasses and get customer support.“I enjoyed the ease of finding the right glasses for me while not having to be in a store,” says Dillon Payne, CNET’s video director. “The site was able to scan my face and I was offered a variety of glasses that I preferred. Warby shipped the glasses out and I picked a couple that I liked after wearing and testing them. The others that didn't suit me were shipped back.”Who is it best for: Warby Parker is best for people who want to try on their reading glasses at home and those who need a +0.25 to +2.75 strength. The company has a six-month, no-scratch guarantee and offers virtual prescription renewal, but only for certain states. You can also visit a store in person to try on the glasses or for customer support. Who should not get it: Warby Parker is not your service if you want to spend under $95 or have a strength over +2.75. The brand also doesn’t offer shipping faster than two to six business days, which is $25 for expedited shipping.  ... Show more

Best reading glasses style variety

It is affordable, with prices from $7 to $65
Has shipping options from 1-5 business days
Cons
The warranty is only 90 days
Powers below +1 and above +3.75 are not available
No virtual try-on or prescription renewal is available
Why we like it: Readers.com offers 269 styles for women and 199 different products for men. Both can also choose multipacks. This is a wide range, which makes sense considering that Readers.com is dedicated only to reading glasses. It also offers strengths from +1 to +3.75, a price range of $7 to $65, various shipping options (including express and priority) and 90 days for returns, exchanges and its warranty. Who is it best for: Readers.com is best for people who want a wide range of styles under $65 for their reading glasses. It is also suitable for shoppers who want a longer return and exchange window of 90 days. If you prefer to buy your reading glasses in multipacks, you can also get those here. Who should not get it: Readers.com is not for anyone who needs a power lower than +1 or higher than +3.75.

Best colorful reading glasses
Peepers
Pros
Great for people looking for fun colors and bold shapes
Has powers from +1 to +4
Offers same-day shipping if ordered before 1 p.m. CST
The return and exchange policy is 90 days
Cons
No strengths under +1
No warranty
Why we like it: One of Oprah’s Favorite Things, this brand is known for its bold shapes and fun colors. They even offer reading glasses with wavy temples. Despite these unique styles, Peepers is also affordable at $23 to $30. Who is it best for: Peepers is best for people looking for affordable but fun reading glasses that fit their personal style and budget. It offers powers from +1 to +4, virtual try-ons, 90-day returns and exchanges and even same-day shipping if you order before 1 p.m. CST. Who should not get it: If you’re looking for reading glasses with a warranty, Peepers is not the brand for you. The same goes for those looking for a strength under +1. If you don’t care about the color of your glasses or want a bold shape, another brand might be better.  ... Show more

Pros
Top frames that can be changed daily
Has virtual try-ons
Cons
Only has strengths from +0.25 to +2.75
No reading glasses under $60
Offers next-day shipping, but it’s $60
Why we like it: Pair Eyewear offers base frames with separate top frames that can be switched up to match your everyday style and mood. Prices start at $60, and strengths depend on style, but we generally see +0.25 to +2.75. You can also use its virtual try-on feature. Who is it best for: Pair Eyewear is best for people looking to spend at least $60 and want to regularly change the appearance of their reading glasses. They also offer next-day shipping (though it’s $60) and 30 days for returns, exchanges and its warranty. Who should not get it: Anyone looking for a reading glass strength above +2.75 should look elsewhere. Pair Eyewear is also not for you if you want a warranty longer than 30 days.  ... Show more

Best reading glasses for Prime members in a pinch
Amazon
Pros
Fast, free shipping for Prime members
Thousands of options in terms of reading glass styles
The affordable price range of $3 to $259
Free returns within 30 days, generally
Cons
Quality is unpredictable and depends on the brand
No warranty in most cases
No virtual try-on
Why we like it: While Amazon is not one of our top picks for reading glasses, if you're a Prime member and need affordable reading glasses ASAP, the brand offers fast, free shipping. Katie Collins, CNET’s director of content, used Prime for reading glasses before and enjoyed the service's many options (the search “reading glasses” brings up 40,000 results), price range and speedy delivery.Who is it best for: Amazon’s reading glasses are best for Prime members in a pinch who need affordable reading glasses within a day or two. If you don’t like the glasses, you must be ready to return them within 30 days (or whatever the particular brand says) because there is no warranty. Popular brands on Amazon include Eyebobs, Firmoo, Look Optic, SCOJO New York and ThinOptics.Who should not get it: What Collins did not like about Amazon is its unpredictable quality and the fact that you can't try them on (not even virtually). Everything comes down to what brand you order from: the power, lens types, coatings, shipping and HSA/FSA acceptance. Returns/exchanges also depend on the brand, but most offer free returns within 30 days. We did not see any that offer a warranty through Amazon.   ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing reading glasses
StrengthReading glasses typically range from +0.25 to +2.50 diopters (the unit of measurement for eye prescriptions), though the average starting strength is usually around +0.75. In rare cases, reading glass strength can go up to +4.00. “Tips for buying reading glasses online are similar to buying ready-made reading glasses at the drugstore: it’s a convenient option, but it’s not a good idea for everyone,” says Dr. Ravi Goel, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. “If you have different prescription needs in each eye, astigmatism, high-power or more complex prescription needs, you should see an eye care professional for updated prescription eyewear.”Reed seconds this, adding, “The wrong prescription can lead to headaches, eye strain or even nausea. If you do choose to buy online, we recommend selecting a lower power when deciding between two strengths, as this is generally a safer choice, and overly strong lenses tend to cause more discomfort than those that are slightly weaker.”Goel notes that everyone over age 40 should see an ophthalmologist for a medical eye exam since that is the age when both presbyopia and potentially blinding eye diseases usually begin developing. Plus, not all eye diseases begin with noticeable symptoms.Type of reading glasses“There are four main types of reading glasses: single vision, bifocal, trifocal and progressive,” says Goel, defining them as:Single-vision reading lenses are typically designed to correct just for near vision. Bifocal lenses have a correction for reading on the bottom half of the lens and another for distance on the top.Trifocal lenses have three sections: distance, intermediate and near vision. Reed says these can be particularly helpful for people over 50 experiencing reduced depth of focus.Progressive lenses have a smooth transition between distance and near focal areas without visible dividing lines. “They deliver a more natural look and a smoother transition between different viewing distances,” adds Reed.“When generic OTC readers are no longer enough, prescription reading glasses -- also called single-vision readers -- are a great next step. These are custom-made by an eye doctor to correct for astigmatism, unequal prescriptions or other specific vision needs,” says Reed. “For those who need multiple levels of vision correction, there are multifocal lenses.” The best lens material“This depends on lifestyle,” Goel says. “For example, if you spend a lot of time outdoors, you might prefer polycarbonate, which is lightweight and doesn’t break easily. There are also various lens coatings available for convenience (i.e., anti-reflective coatings) but are not required.”Goel notes that the American Academy of Ophthalmology doesn't recommend blue light-blocking coatings or lenses because “there is no scientific evidence to suggest blue light-blocking glasses help reduce eye strain.” Instead, take breaks from near-work activity and use eye drops if necessary. If you continue to experience symptoms, see an ophthalmologist.According to Reed, most people choose between the following three lens materials for reading glasses:CR-39 plastic lenses: Affordable, lightweight and provide good optical clarity, making them a popular choice for basic reading glasses.Polycarbonate lenses: Lighter and significantly more impact-resistant than CR-39 plastic, making them a safer option for people who tend to drop their glasses or want something more durable. High-index plastic lenses: Thinner and lighter than other materials and are a good choice for people who need a stronger prescription but want to avoid thick, heavy lenses.“For most reading glasses, especially for occasional or indoor use, CR-39 plastic works well,” says Reed. “If you need extra durability or prefer thinner, lighter lenses, polycarbonate or high-index materials may be a better fit. Your doctor of optometry can help recommend the best lens material based on your specific needs.”Reed adds that not all lens materials and coatings are created equal. That’s why it’s important to check with your eye doctor to ensure the reading glasses you choose are the right fit for you. StyleOne of the most fun parts of buying glasses is finding a frame that speaks to your personal style and fits with your face shape. When shopping for glasses online, pay attention to the material, color and width. PriceReading glasses can range from affordable to expensive. For instance, if you want a designer pair of reading glasses, be prepared to spend over $100. If you tend to lose your reading glasses, you may want to buy more inexpensive pairs to keep multiple on hand.“Price of eyeglasses is not necessarily reflective of quality; the real question is if someone finds the ready-made reading glasses helpful or if they need custom reading glasses to meet their vision needs,” explains Goel.  “In general, spending more on frames doesn’t mean you’ll end up with better-quality eyeglasses. You don’t need designer frames to have a good set of glasses. For prescription lenses, such as bifocal, trifocal or progressive lenses, an optician will help you select good lenses that best meet your vision needs. A personalized evaluation of vision needs is a value-add that is often missed by online sellers.”Additional coatingsYou can get reading glasses with lenses treated with blue light, anti-glare and polarization coatings. But note that you'll likely have to pay extra for these. Shipping and returnsIf you buy your reading glasses online, you likely won’t get to try them on before you buy. As a result, ensure the company has a return and exchange policy you can work with. As for shipping, if you need your reading glasses ASAP, you’re better off going with a company that offers express or overnight shipping.  How we tested the best reading glasses
While these reading glasses were not hands-on tested, we did read customer reviews and pool insights from CNET writers and editors. We also considered different strengths, style selection, shipping, returns and exchanges, warranties, price, virtual and at-home try-ons, HSA/FSA acceptance and whether there's virtual prescription renewal available for each brand. How we chose the best reading glasses
Customer reviews: We pooled thoughts from fellow CNET writers and editors and reviewed customer reviews and ratings.Strengths: For each company, we checked to see which strengths are offered for reading glasses.Style selection: We examined each brand's number of reading glasses styles, as well as the colors, shapes, materials and other unique features. We also examined the different lens types and coatings offered.Shipping: In addition to shipping time, we also considered shipping prices and which brands offer free, fast shipping. Returns, exchanges and warranties: We checked the return and exchange time frame (and whether shipping is included) and the length of the brand’s warranty and what it encompasses.Price: We looked at each company’s price range to see if people with different budgets could shop for reading glasses there. Virtual try-on and prescription renewal: Does the brand offer virtual or even at-home try-ons? We considered this question and checked whether each company offers online prescription renewal.
Reading glasses FAQs
How do you know when you need reading glasses?
“Adults in their early to mid-forties often start noticing difficulty seeing things up close, like when reading or using digital devices,” says Reed. “This normal, age-related change in the eye’s focusing ability is called presbyopia and tends to progress over time. To manage it, many people turn to reading glasses or other forms of near vision correction.”Goel adds, “Most people begin to notice changes to their vision around the age of 40. That’s the age when the clear natural lens of your eye becomes less flexible, which leads to difficulty focusing well on near objects.”According to Reed, some signs of presbyopia include:Squinting more frequentlyTrouble seeing smaller print in dim lightNeeding to hold reading materials at arm's lengthBlurred vision at a normal reading distance Eye fatigue or headaches when doing close work

How do I know what strength of reading glasses to get?
“A doctor of optometry can help determine the best reading glasses for patients’ specific visual needs,” says Reed. “If they mainly wear them while using a computer, they will likely need a lower power, since screens are typically viewed from a greater distance than a book or magazine. The farther away the object, the less magnification you need for clear, comfortable vision.”For those who need reading glasses for viewing details up close, Reed states that the patient will want a stronger power. “ In most cases, when deciding between two similar strengths, it’s best to choose the lower one -- glasses that are too strong are more likely to cause discomfort than those that are slightly too weak.”While seeing an eye care professional for an accurate prescription and to check for signs of eye disease (especially starting at age 40) is the right idea, Goel adds, “People can try on a few different types of reading glasses at the drugstore and see if they find something that feels right.”

Are cheap reading glasses OK? Is there a difference in quality?
“The optical quality of OTC reading glasses can vary quite a bit,” Reed explains. “As I mentioned, one of the main drawbacks is that these ready-made readers are essentially one-size-fits-all. They’re designed for short-term use and work best for people without astigmatism and with the same prescription in both eyes.”Reed adds that OTC reading glasses typically range from $1 to $50 or more. Prescription reading glasses, on the other hand, can vary in price based on the lens type, provider and insurance coverage. He says, “I always recommend that patients talk with their eye doctor about the best options for their needs -- and ask about programs or benefits that might help with the cost of care.”

What can I use reading glasses for?
“Reading glasses provide a simple and effective way to improve near vision to make everyday tasks easier and more comfortable,” says Reed. “They can improve clarity when reading books, menus or phone screens and assist with daily activities like using a computer or crafting. Furthermore, they can minimize eye fatigue and headaches caused by prolonged screen time to improve overall productivity and comfort.”
