How we test
With over seven years of eye-care testing experience, we use our expertise to offer well-rounded, honest reviews.
What to consider
Price
Some sites offer basic packages with cheap frames and entry-level lenses that cost very little money, sometimes less than $20. Basic prescription glasses may be fine if you only plan on using the glasses on limited basis or for sunglasses. But understand that the cheapest online glasses may not be good enough as everyday glasses.
Return policy
It's important to read the fine print when it comes to the return policy when selecting an online glasses retailer. Some return policies are better than others, with retailers offering full refunds rather than store credit if you're not satisfied.
Turnaround times
If you're looking to get a pair of glasses quickly, look for sites that have fast turnaround and shipping times. Typically, you have to pay extra for expedited shipping but a few sites offering faster shipping for free or at a low extra cost. Look to use an insurance-friendly site like Glasses.com if you have vision insurance.
Frame fit and style
When shopping online, it can be hard to tell exactly how a frame will look on your face and how well they'll fit. Some sites offer virtual try-on features that work pretty well, but if you want to be sure about getting a comfortable fit that's right for your face and nose shape, you can opt to use a site that offers free at-home try-on for a few frames. It's also worth noting whether the frames offer adjustable nose pads or spring hinges for a better fit.
Insurance coverage
A few online glasses retailers accept insurance from vision insurance providers like Eyemed, Superior Vision, Aetna Vision Preferred, Cigna, Humana, UnitedHealthcare Vision and make it easy to buy glasses with insurance. Many sites don't accept insurance but provide you with a reimbursement form to file with your insurance provider after you make a purchase.
Prescription accuracy and lens options
It's important to provide a current prescription with accurate PD measurements. Have an accurate prescription and opting for higher quality lens are the most important factors that allow you to see clearly through your prescription glasses. Measurements that are even slightly off can impact clarity. It's also a good idea to opt for a lighter lens option if available for your prescription. Lighter frames and glasses tend to be more comfortable.

Since then, the online glasses industry has changed to offer virtual try-ons and eye exams, more variety and even AI-driven recommendations that can make shopping for a pair of glasses even easier. What's the best place to buy glasses online? I tested them all to find out, focusing on price, return policy, insurance options, virtual try-on availability and more. I also reached out to other CNET editors for their reviews. What is the best place to buy prescription glasses online?Zenni is currently at the top of our list because it has a good selection of frames and lens options at the lowest prices. Warby Parker was previously my top pick, and GlassesUSA is also one of the most affordable sites. Our editors have had great shopping experiences at Warby Parker, and it features the option to buy from its many brick-and-mortar stores. Note that if you're looking for replacement prescription lenses to put into your favorite frames, check out our list of the best places to buy replacement lenses online. I also point contact lens users to our best places to buy contact lenses online list, and those looking for reading glasses to our best reading glasses to buy online list.

Best prescription glasses for budget-conscious shoppers
Zenni
Pros
Relatively low prices with basic complete Rx glasses packages starting at less than $20 delivered
Shop by face type and price
Virtual try-on feature
Decent selection of frames, including a line of affordable cycling frames
Cons
Standard shipping times can be a little slow
Zenni's sub-$20 frames look and feel a little cheap
Plastic case glasses arrive is really only suitable for shipping.
Why I chose Zenni: Zenni has been around for a while, and it's the first site I used to buy cheap prescription glasses and sunglasses online. It's more of a budget-minded site, and over the years, I got some nice deals on cheap glasses (you can get glasses with a basic frame and basic lenses delivered for less than $20), particularly when Zenni was running its occasional three-for-two glasses sales. I've had both standard eyeglasses and prescription sunglasses made here, and so has fellow editor David Katzmaier, who has since graduated to Warby Parker (he said he would still buy prescription sunglasses at Zenni because they're cheap and decent enough).CNET Senior Editor reports: "I have horrendous eyesight without correction, so I need a strong glasses prescription, even though I usually wear contact lenses. Because of that, the glasses I've gotten from Zenni cost a bit more than the $20 or so you often see advertised, but they're still generally under $100, and they get the job done."In the last couple of years, Zenni has been subtly shifting its image, bringing in celebrities like Rashida Jones, 49ers tight-end George Kittle and Celtics guard Jrue Holiday to give the brand a little more of a hip vibe. It's also doing a better job with it's affordable Rz-ready sports/cycling glasses, adding a line called Zunnies. Zenni's midrange lenses are good -- it's probably best to avoid the entry-level lenses -- and the site offers nice deals on upgrades to photochromic lenses.Who this is for: This service is excellent for budget-conscious shoppers who are looking for a quality pair of prescription glasses for less than $75.Notable site features: Zenni has a virtual "magic mirror" try-on feature that allows you to see the glasses on your face as you move around using your computer's webcam or your phone's camera. This is similar to the virtual try-on feature that Warby Parker offers. These virtual try-on features are helpful but never quite as good as trying glasses on for real in a brick-and-mortar store.Shipping times: With standard shipping ($4.96), delivery times are listed as 7-14 days. But for an extra fee Zenni offers a rush delivery option that gets you your new glasses in 1 to 4 business days for $40 extra or 2 to 5 days for $19 extra (there's also a third "express" delivery option for $15 that's listed as 5-10 business days).

Pros
Budget-friendly
Over 1,300 frame options
Good selection of designer frames
14-day free trial of frames with your prescription in them
Free prescription scanner app
Cons
The cheapest frames do look and feel a little cheap
Why I chose GlassesUSA: GlassesUSA is somewhat similar to Zenni, but offers an even wider selection of frames, with over 1,300 models listed. While its prescription glasses packages tend to cost a little more on average than Zenni's, it's more affordable for buying prescription eyeglasses and designer eyeglasses online than sites like Warby Parker and Roka, with full prescription glasses starting at $24. It also features premium designer frames from high-quality eyeglasses brands, including Ray-Ban and Persol. Designer frames cost more but their discounted price is better than what you'd find in a brick-and-mortar store.CNET Senior Editor Laura Michelle Davis reports: "I've had several eye surgeries (including corneal transplants), making my prescription very complicated. Most popular retailers can't fill my order because of the strange axis and prism, so I had to dig around for labs that could. Glasses USA was one of the only online options. They have a wide selection of frames, including 'clip-on' shades, allowing me to just order one pair as opposed to separate sunglasses. They also offer a lot of discounts and deals on a regular basis.They also have a decent return policy." As for what she doesn't like, she says: "It's not always easy to get in touch with customer service. But the squeaky wheel gets the grease."CNET Managing Editor Josh Goldman is generally a fan of Zenni but notes: "Some of the cheaper frames do, in fact, look and feel cheap. Also, the quality of the progressive lenses have been hit or miss."Like most online glasses retailers, GlassesUSA offers various discounts off your first frames, as well as discounts on lens upgrades (photochromic, for instance), contact lens options and reading glasses. Around major holidays you can look for seasonal promotions on men's eyeglasses, women's glasses and contact lenses.Who this is for: Someone who's looking for a wide range of frames and lens options at more affordable prices than Warby Parker.Notable site features: A virtual "mirror" feature lets you upload your photo to the site and see what a pair of eyeglasses looks like on your face shape to help you find the perfect pair of optical frames. The company is upping the try-at-home ante. Instead of just sending you the frames, GlassesUSA will send you the frame with your actual prescription in it so you can truly try it out for up to 14 days -- although the feature is limited to certain frames and lens options. The site also offers a 100% money-back guarantee so you can return your glasses if you don't like what you ultimately get. Lastly, you can download a free prescription scanner app for iOS or Android that allows you to "extract the optical parameters from your current glasses" using your phone and a PC (it works with relatively simple prescriptions, so read the fine print to see its limitations). While we've spotted a few negative online reviews for GlassesUSA, the company seems to diligently follow up and respond to each one.Shipping times: Expect 7 to 10 days between ordering and arrival of GlassesUSA products, depending on the types of glasses and the shipping option you choose.Current discounts: Check out GlassesUSA's coupons and promotions landing page  ...

Best online shopping experience for prescription glasses
Warby Parker
Pros
High quality frames and lenses
Convenient iPhone app
Some cities have Warby Parker brick-and-mortar stores
Try up to 5 frames at home for 5 for free
Online vision test
Cons
Pricier than some competitors
Scratch-free guarantee used to be a full year, now it's down to 6 months
Limited promotional sales
Why I chose Warby Parker: Several CNET editors have bought their glasses from Warby Parker, which has a good selection of sharp-looking eyeglass frames. While glasses and sunglasses start at only $95 for both a single-vision and progressive lens prescription, chances are you're going to pay a bit more -- around $150 to $200 -- based on the type of frame options you choose, your prescription and type of eyeglass lenses. Based on my co-workers' experiences as well as my own, the finished products tend to be a step up from what more budget-oriented sites offer.Ajay Kumar, CNET's Home & Energy Editor, reports: "I'm a big fan of Warby Parker for a couple of reasons. They offer free home try-ons by mailing up to five frames at a time to you. As someone who needs high-index lenses and opts for add-ons like anti-glare and bluelight blocking, they're less than half the price of alternatives like LensCrafters. And while you can buy prescription glasses online and get your fit using the app, they also have physical stores you can go to if you want to look at frames, need adjustments or any other kind of customer support. They also have a 6-month scratch-free guarantee, and there's a decent discount if you buy more than one frame at a time.While you can use your FSA or HSA with Warby, Alexandra Able, Sr. Director of CNET Group Social, laments, "I wish my eye insurance covered my Warby glasses."Who this is for: Someone who likes the idea of being able to shop online but also try on glasses in a brick-and-mortar store.Notable site features: The company's mobile apps allow you to search the site by frame size and to try on various frames virtually (it works surprisingly well) and better yet, you can try up to five frames at home for five days for free. Once your five days are up, you place your box in the mail with the prepaid return label (hopefully, you find at least one style that you like from among the five you picked for the home trial). There's also a $15 online virtual vision test to renew prescriptions that are outdated. (Based on the test, you may not be eligible.)Warby also has physical optical stores in some locations around the country if you want to go in and try frames that way. Some of these locations also offer eye tests and that prescription can be used at Warby or elsewhere.The online glasses store also has a "buy a pair, give a pair" program, so for every pair of glasses you buy, the company distributes a pair to someone in need, either for free or for "ultra-affordable prices." (See details.)Shipping times: According to Warby: "Single vision glasses take seven to 10 business days to reach you from the time we have all of your order information. Sunglasses and progressives take 10 to 12 business days to reach you." (These estimates jibe with the experience of CNET editors who have used the service, and my pair arrived in six business days.) You can pay more for expedited shipping.Current discounts: Get 15% off when you buy two or more pairs of prescription eyeglasses or sunglasses, no promo code required.  ... Show more

Good value and fast delivery option
EyeBuyDirect
Pros
Good mix of affordable and designer options
Two-day shipping available
Frame types sorted into six types
Virtual try-on
Fit and style quiz
Cons
Cheap frames look and feel a little cheap
Why I chose EyeBuyDirect: EyeBuyDirect is similar in many ways to a lot of its competitors. Along with an in-house frame brand (Rflkt Eyewear) it has some Ray-Ban and Oakley frames. I went with a more affordable Rflkt frame and paired it with a higher-end lens. The price came out to around $150 -- you can go cheaper or more expensive. The most budget-friendly pairs are under 10 bucks. The frame quality was decent though not on par with Roka's frames, for example. Lens quality was good for midrange lens and the ordering process was smooth, with a standard virtual try-on feature where you upload a photo of yourself to help you find the perfect frame.CNET Senior Editor Mike Sorrentino reports: "I appreciate that EyeBuyDirect has low prices for buying two pairs of glasses along with a flexible return policy. I also find that their customer service is fairly open to negotiation. For instance, when I need to make a return, they often attempt to add additional credit in order to incentivize me to get a new pair of glasses instead of a refund. Since this takes place over email, you can attempt to make additional requests like a more expensive frame and possibly not have to pay anything extra. Your mileage may vary, but their flexibility when I have an issue does help keep me coming back."Who this is for: Someone looking for a good value and fast delivery options.Notable site features: The site has a virtual try-on feature and a fit-and-style quiz that helps you pick out a frame. Frame types are sorted into six types: classic, artsy, eco-friendly, bold and street style. It's also worth noting that with every pair of glasses you buy, you can opt to have EyeBuyDirect donate a pair to a person in need somewhere in the world: You pick where.Shipping times: EyeBuyDirect direct says its typical turnaround time is 7 to 14 business days but with single-vision lenses, you can get free two-day delivery that can cut turnaround times (many frames are available for two-day delivery).Current discounts: All of EyeBuyDirect's deals and promo codes are displayed on its home page.  ...

Overnight Glasses
Best online glasses retailer with extra fast delivery
Overnight Glasses
Pros
Fast turnaround times
User-friendly site
Good selection of lens types
Cons
Expensive for rush jobs
Why I chose Overnight Glasses: As its name implies, Overnight Glasses can make you a new set of prescription glasses quickly, and really quickly if you're willing to pay extra for it. If you buy a frame/lens package, fast three- to four-day service is available for $9. (It takes slightly longer for progressive and bifocal lens types.) The quality of the lenses I got was as good as that from other replacement lens sites, so there's no sacrifice on prescription eyewear quality for speed. Lenses and a new frame will cost you from $42 to $750.As for new lenses, you ship your frames to Overnight Glasses and they'll replace your lenses with new ones in 48 hours. They can do polarized, blue light, Transitions and many other types, although progressive takes an additional two days (so 72 hours total from the time your frames are received).If you're looking for a truly overnight option, its emergency, 24-hour rush service costs an additional $30 for single vision. As noted, a progressive lens order can take an additional two days, so the fastest you can get new progressive lenses is three days.Overnight makes lenses for audio glasses.Who this is for: Someone who needs new prescription glasses as soon as possible.Notable site features: The site has a clean look and is easy to use. Shipping options are one of the key focuses.Shipping times: As fast as 48 hours from the time your eyeglass frame is received, while 24-hour rush service costs an additional $30 for single vision (progressives take an additional two days) or is free on orders $180 and over. Note that coupons and discounts do not change the original order amount so if your original order amount was $185 and you got 30% off, you're still eligible for the free overnight rush service.As for lens-replacement orders, these are the ship times, according to Overnight: "Orders $150 and over get free second-day Air UPS delivery both ways, included automatically when the order reaches that amount. New lenses for single-vision prescriptions are delivered in five days or less if you send your frames the same day you order. Orders under $150 can add the speedy service for an additional $20 or get free ground USPS shipping."Current discounts: Check out Overnight Glasses' coupons and promotions landing page.  ...

Lensabl
Best online glasses retailer for swapping out old lenses
Lensabl
Pros
Lens replacement for most glasses starting at $97
Online vision test
Free shipping
Cons
Not particularly affordable
Limited promotional sales
Why I chose Lensabl: What do you do if you already have a pair of eyeglasses frames you like but your prescription is old (or the lenses on your frames are scratched) and you just want to replace the lenses? Lensabl is one of the few sites that allows you to send in your own pair of frames and get a new prescription lens for them. Its motto is, "Your frames, our lenses."You upload your prescription online, pick the type of lens you want, and then Lensabl sends you a box with a prepaid return shipping label. You simply mail them your glasses in the box (shipping is free). First-time customers get 15% off. This site is also a good option if you have an old pair of glasses that you want to turn into prescription sunglasses.Lensabl also offers full glasses packages with its own frames. Many of the options are free with an accompanying lens purchase.Who this is for: Those who wants to swap out the lenses from their favorite frames because their prescription has changed or the lenses are damaged. Notable site features: For $25, you can renew your prescription online with Visibly. Not everybody qualifies to take the online eye exam -- you have to answer some questions to see if you qualify -- but if you do, Lensabl says, "All you need is your computer, smartphone and about 15 minutes of time." Your results will be reviewed by an eye doctor or optometrist licensed in your state who will then issue you a new prescription via email.Shipping times: Lensabl pledges "about two weeks" turnaround time from when you ship your frames to when you'll receive them back.Current discounts: All of Lensabl's deals and promo codes are displayed on its homepage.  ...

Best Insurance-friendly online prescription glasses retailer
Glasses.com
Pros
Accepts most vision insurance plans
Easy to pay through insurance
Decent selection of premium brands
Long return/exchange window
Cons
Limited site features
Why I chose Glasses.com: Our tester who used glasses.com reported a good experience. She said Glasses.com accepts a lot of vision insurance plans and automatically handles payment if your insurance provider is in their network (you can usually get one pair of glasses-free). If your vision insurance plan is out of network, like VSP and Spectera, the site automatically generates a bill (via email) that you need to submit to get reimbursed. Glasses.com also sells Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses along with other premium brands like Armani, Burberry and Coach and a glasses.com collection of value "premium frames" that start at $55.Who this is for: Those looking for an online glasses retailer that accepts most vision insurance plans, both in and out-of-network.Notable site features: Glasses.com is a pretty no-frills site. It does have a quiz you can take that recommends what frames are right for you. You can also return frames and lenses within 60 days if you have an issue with them.Shipping times: Expect around 14 days with the free shipping option or around eight days with expedited shipping ($15). Current discounts: Check out Glasses.com's coupons and promotions landing page.  ...

Eyeglasses.com
Best for high-quality lenses and massive frame selection
Eyeglasses.com
Pros
Huge selection of frames (300 brands to choose from)
High-quality lens options
Helpful filters
Fast shipping times (less than 6 days)
Cons
Selection can be overwhelming
No virtual try-on feature
Why I chose Eyeglasses.com: Eyeglasses.com's huge selection of both frames and lenses is a big selling point, but it also has the downside of offering so many options that it can be a little daunting to figure out exactly what to buy. You can get budget options -- lens prices start at $34 -- but the site skews toward more premium options. The idea is to get a significant discount (upwards of $200) on a high-quality frame-and-lens combo that you'd spend big bucks for in a brick-and-mortar shop. "Our business targets the main part of the eyewear industry, to supply the same products that customers would get at the eye doctor, but at 50% lower prices," CEO and Founder Mark Agnew told me.The site carries over 300 brands and 200,000 individual models, which seems to be the largest catalog of any online glasses site. The filters are also decent, allowing you to filter by rim style, material, brand, price, category, eye size, clips and country of origin. There are advanced search options too, such as bridge size and temple size, and B measurement. There's no virtual try-on feature, and many of the frames don't have models to show you what the frames look like on someone's face.Who this is for: Someone who wants the widest selection of frame choices.Notable site features: Eyeglasses.com says it only sells "high quality, individually made lenses made in the USA" and the sample glasses I tried had excellent lenses that gave me a very sharp image. As I said, there's a huge selection of lens options, and you get a "Perfect Lenses Guarantee" that allows you to send your glasses back if they don't work for you. You can get a one-time free redo of the lenses, or a full refund on the frames and 50% cash back on the lenses, your choice.The site also offers a lens replacement option for your existing frames (you send your frames in). Unlike Lensabl (see below) which highlights the feature, Eyeglasses.com doesn't market this option front and center. You can also get new glasses very quickly if you choose to pay extra for expedited shipping.Shipping times: Less than 6 days, according to the site. I received a new pair in a couple of days, but I had an expedited shipping option.Current discounts: Check out Eyeglasses.com's landing page.  ... Show more

Online glasses retailer with best frames
Roka Eyewear
Pros
Excellent frames
Good selection
Durable and comfortable
Cons
Somewhat pricey
No virtual try-on
Why I chose Roka Eyewear: Austin, Texas-based Roka's marketing slogan is "The most technically advanced eyewear that doesn't look technical," and its glasses are impressively light, durable and stylish looking. Like Warby Parker, these are at the higher end of the online prescription eyeglasses spectrum, with prices of around $200 for a completed pair of prescription glasses, depending on some of the lens upgrades you might add. But Roka has some of the best glasses frames out there.Roka started out making athletic glasses for runners, bikers and triathletes, and many of its prescription frames are bendable at the ends and have rubberized tracks that help you get a more secure fit. The frames also come with three sizes of grippy nose pads to ensure a better fit. They are among the most comfortable glasses I've worn, and they really stay on your face.Who this is for: Someone who appreciates high-quality frames that are lightweight, durable and stylish.
Notable site features: Roka used to have a home-trial program, but that's no longer available. It does offer an online virtual vision test to renew prescriptions that are outdated (based on the test, you may not be eligible, however). Roka says it accepts "returns or exchanges on most items within 30 days of receipt. Returns of prescription eyewear are allowed — for a refund or store credit — and require a $20 restocking fee."Shipping times: Roka has improved its turnaround times since it began cutting lenses in Austin. It says its standard prescription eyeglasses, readers, and nonprescription sunglasses "will generally ship by the next business day. Our prescription sunglasses and progressives will generally ship in 5 to 7 business days." For all its glasses, Roka offers free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, as well as optional expedited shipping options, including overnight shipping.  ... Show more

FramesDirect
Pros
Huge selection of designer frames
Good customer service
Cons
Limited affordable options
Why I chose FramesDirect: FramesDirect is similar to a lot of the other online glasses retailers, but it focuses more on offering decent discounts on premium brand frames, claiming to have the largest selection of designer glasses online. This eyewear retailer is also one of the few places that offers prescription lens inserts for the Quest 2 VR headset (though not the Quest 3) and stocks all the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.Finally, the site has strong customer service ratings from TrustPilot.Who this is for: People looking for a wide selection of premium brand frames at discounted prices.Notable site features: Like its sister site EyeBuyDirect and others, FramesDirect has a philanthropic partnership with the Essilor Vision Foundation to improve the sight of people who can't afford glasses. FrameDirect says that "for every pair of glasses bought, we will donate a pair of glasses to someone in need," and you can select the region for the donated pair. Like Zenni, Warby Parker and others, it has a virtual try-on feature.Shipping times: Expect around 14 days.Current discounts: Check out FramesDirect's coupons and promotions landing page.  ...

Best for prescription sports glasses
SportRx
Pros
Can shop by specific sport or activity
Knowledgeable customer service staff
SportRx now has its own branded glasses packages that are more affordable, starting at $99
Cons
Premium frames are pretty pricey
Why I chose SportRx: As you'd expect, SportRx caters to people looking for sports-oriented prescription glasses, with a wide variety of options from big eyewear brands such as Smith, Oakley, Ray-Ban, Costa and Nike. Not all the frames it sells have an Rx option, but most do. Although you'll get a better deal here than you'd get from your local sunglasses boutique, this is not a budget site and you can end up paying upwards of $250 or more, depending on your prescription. That said, SportRx runs some deals on premium frames and also gives you access to a real optician to help you decide which glasses are right for your prescription and athletic pursuits (making Rx lenses for sports glasses can be tricky). Also, it now has its own branded frames that are more affordable, with prescription sport glasses starting at $99.Who this is for: People looking for prescription sports glasses.Notable site features: SportRx says that instead of speaking (or live-chatting) to a run-of-the-mill customer service staffer hidden in some obscure call center, you're speaking with a "friendly SportRx Optician in sunny San Diego" who's gone through a rigorous training regimen (the SportRx Academy) and is well-versed in various aspects of optics: refractive light, myopia, presbyopia, astigmatism and everything else you can think of. "What's more," the site says, "they have extensive training on the best sports frame and lens options on the planet."Shipping times: Around 14 days.Current discounts: Check out SportRx's coupons and promotions landing page.  ...

Why should you trust us about finding the best places to buy glasses online?
At CNET, not only have we reviewed a wide range of online glasses retailers, including the most popular sites for buying glasses online, but we periodically go back and retest retailers we've already tried out. We also monitor any new notable features that only glasses sites might add, as well as any special discounts and new product options. Additionally, we endeavor to try out a site's budget options along with higher-priced offerings since there are so many lens and frame options to choose from. In many but not all cases, we also jury test retailers, with multiple CNET editors providing feedback from their experiences using a site. This is particularly true for popular sites like Zenni, Warby Parker, GlassesUSA and EyeBuyDirect. Finally, we've consulted ophthalmologists and other eyewear experts to make sure we're providing useful and accurate information. How we chose the best places to buy glasses online
For this roundup of the best online retailers for prescription glasses, we considered factors like affordability, variety of selections, notable site features, shipping time and quality. These online retailers were independently chosen by our editors.Read more: How to Use Your Smartphone to Check Your Vision How to buy prescription glasses online
1. The first thing you need to buy prescription glasses online is a prescription. The best way to get an accurate prescription is to visit an optometrist and have an eye exam, which tends to cost around $100. After the test is complete, you need to make sure you get a hard copy of your prescription so you can retain it for your records. Alternatively, you can pick up a device like the $99 EyeQue Vision Check (out of stock) to use your smartphone to check your vision and create a prescription that many online glasses stores will accept, although some do require a prescription from an optometrist.2. Get your pupillary distance number from your optometrist or measure it yourself. Be aware that sometimes optometrists won't give your pupillary distance because they'll say they want to measure you for a specific set of glasses. Insist on getting one because it's required to order glasses online. Note that you can also measure PD yourself using an app on your smartphone or download a PD ruler that most online stores have available for download with instructions on how to use it. Pupillary distance is key because when lenses are made it's important to know where your eye is in relation to the center of the lens.3. Make sure your prescription isn't out of date. If you haven't had a vision test in a while, it might be a good idea to get another one. Some sites like Warby Parker offer an inexpensive virtual vision test if your prescription is out of date but you feel you're seeing well out of your current glasses (but still want to replace them). You take a five-minute vision test, looking at an eye chart from home. An eye doctor then reviews the results and responds within 48 hours to let you know if you've qualified for a prescription renewal.4. Some but not all stores accept dollars from Flexible Spending and Health Savings Accounts. If you have money you want to use from an FSA or HSA, or have vision insurance, you need to check on the store's insurance, FSA and HSA policies before making a purchase. Many do accept them.5. Go to an online retailer and select a pair of frames that you like. This can be the hardest part of the process because it's tricky to know exactly what you'll look like in the glasses unless you try the frames on in person and look at yourself in a mirror. Some online retailers have virtual try-on applications or, even better, they'll ship you a few frames to try on at home before you select one or more to buy.6. Provide your prescription. With some online retailers, you can simply take a picture of your prescription with your smartphone and upload the image to the site. Most prescription glasses sites also allow you to manually input your prescription numbers, which is typically what I do. When a site asks for your prescription, it will also ask for your PD number.7. Select the type of lenses you want. You can buy complete basic single-vision prescription glasses for less than $20 online. And in most cases, they'll work fine. You will certainly notice a difference when upgrading to higher-quality lenses in terms of clarity and weight (thinner, lighter lenses tend to cost more). I personally have a few cheap sets of prescription glasses that I keep in my car or in a backpack as backup glasses in case something should happen to my main pair. What I've found is that often the best thing to do is spend a little more for a higher-grade lens and not go for the cheapest option.8. Before making your final purchase, read the fine print on the site's return policy. Many sites are good about letting you return glasses if the lenses you ordered (based on your correct prescription numbers) aren't good for some reason or the frames just don't fit right. Read the fine print on the return policy. In some cases, you can get a full refund and in others a store credit. Sometimes stores will only offer a partial store credit. You don't want to be surprised if something goes wrong. I've only had one company screw up my order with the wrong prescription in one lens.9. Input any discount codes at checkout. Glasses sites constantly have promos running with discount codes that you input at checkout, although they sometimes exclude premium frames from name-brand companies. Sometimes you'll see slightly sweeter deals around a holiday, with online glasses stores using almost any holiday as an excuse to offer a new discount code.
Best places to buy glasses online FAQs
Is it a good idea to buy glasses online?
Yes, particularly if you're looking to save money, often a significant amount. Before purchasing glasses online, most people initially go to an optometrist for a proper eye exam to get their prescription.
Show more
What is the best place to buy glasses online?
It really depends on what you're looking for in terms of frame style and pricing. Every store on this list is a good place to shop for glasses online, but the types of frames vary by store, with some stores offering more premium frames, which tend to cost more. Lens quality also can vary, and some stores offer faster delivery.
Show more
Who has the best prices for prescription glasses?
Stores like Zenni Optical and EyeBuyDirect advertise offers for cheap prescription glasses (including frames and lenses) for $7 or even slightly less. While that's slightly deceptive -- only because the price doesn't include tax and shipping, and you really should add an anti-glare coating to the lens for about $4 extra -- I have put together a usable pair of glasses for around $17 shipped.
Show more
What can I expect to pay for a pair of prescription glasses online?
You can often get glasses with basic frames and lenses for less than $100 and sometimes even less than $50 during certain promotions. (I once bought a pair of prescription glasses for $9 that I can't say were all that good, but I've kept them in my car as an emergency pair.)More premium lenses made of lighter and stronger materials, with additional scratch resistance and anti-glare coating or photochromic lenses that change from clear to tinted, cost significantly more. A pair of premium Rx glasses that might cost you $300 to $400 online would probably cost double that or more in a brick-and-mortar shop.Note that some online glasses shops do accept vision insurance, though even if they do, you'll have to check whether they accept your specific vision insurance. Many online eyewear retailers, including Warby Parker, accept money from flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts along with vision insurance. Shopping online also allows you to get higher-end eyewear at more budget-conscious prices, as you can often find glasses deals.
Show more
Can I return prescription glasses I buy online?
Yes, sometimes prescription glasses don't end up being perfect and may end up bothering your eyes. I once had a certain online store screw up the prescription in the left lens while the right one was correct. In many cases, you can return the glasses if you're not satisfied, but make sure to read the fine print on the store's return policy. Often, the store will remake the glasses for you or give you a full refund. Certain sites only offer partial refunds.
Show more
What kind of deals can I find for prescription glasses online?
Most sites offer 15% to 20% off your first purchase if you provide an email address. Many sites also offer additional deals with certain codes at checkout, whether it's discounts on frames, lenses, lens upgrades and sometimes you'll see a buy-one-get-one-free deal. Typically restrictions apply, which can mean you can only use the code for certain frames and less complicated prescriptions (single lens as opposed to progressive lenses). Look for sales and new codes to crop up around various holidays.
Show more
What type of eyeglass lens is best?
For pure clarity, a glass or mineral glass lens is the best. Most people prefer polycarbonate lenses, which are lighter and more durable. High-index lenses are good for those who have strong prescriptions that would normally require thicker lenses. These high-tech plastic lenses end up being the same thinness as standard plastic or polycarbonate lenses that have a lighter prescription. You do have to pay more for high-index lenses. Arguably the best lenses are Trivex lenses, which are lightweight and durable and offer slightly better clarity than polycarbonate lenses. They are more expensive than plastic (CR-39) and polycarbonate lenses.
Show more
How often do you need to buy new glasses?
Optometrists generally recommend that you purchase new glasses every one to two years. Though some people may need to order new glasses more frequently due to vision health conditions like cataracts or damage to the lenses or frames.
Show more
What measurements do I need to order glasses online?
In addition to providing your prescription, you'll also need to have some key measurements on hand to make sure that you're getting the right frames to fit your face. You'll generally want to know your pupillary distance (PD), frame width, lens width, lens height, bridge width and temple length measurements. You can use Zenni's DIY guide to measure yourself if you have an pair old glasses that fit well.
Show more
Is GlassesUSA or Zenni better?
Based on our testing and research, we found Zenni to be better than GlassesUSA, but the latter is still a great option for affordable prices.
