How we test
With more than four years covering health- and eye-care products, we consider availability, shipping and return policy to determine our roundup of the best places to buy contact lenses.
What to consider
Lens prescription
To order any type of contact lenses, you'll first need a prescription from your doctor.
Insurance policy
If your insurance policy covers vision care, check to see if the retailer you're considering accepts your insurance.
Contacts brand
If your doctor prescribed a particular brand of contacts, it's best to stick with a retailer that offers that brand.
Return policy
Be sure to double-check the retailer's return policy in case you need to make a return.

As someone who has worn prescription glasses for over 20 years, I’ve gone back and forth between glasses and prescription contact lenses a few times. I’ve tried just about every way to buy them: Through my eye doctor, wholesale stores and even online retailers. I now shop online for most of my eye care because of the convenience and price. With so many options, it can be hard to know which sites are reputable, affordable and easy to use. I tapped my fellow editors at CNET to find out where they buy their contact lenses online. We compared prices, shipping and ease of use to round up the best online retailers for contact lenses. Our Picks

Scout by Warby Parker
Best overall place to buy contacts online
Warby Parker
Pros
Competitive pricing
Wide variety of brands
Accepts most vision insurance providers
Great for people who want to get glasses and contacts from one company
Cons
Depending on your insurance plan, you may not get reimbursed.
Why I chose Warby Parker: I first tried Warby Parker for glasses, but quickly realized its contact lens service is equally impressive. The interface is clean, ordering is simple and the virtual prescription renewal saved me during busy weeks when I couldn’t get to the eye doctor. It’s one of the most convenient ways to buy contacts online, especially if you want everything in one place. Warby Parker also offers Scout, its own daily lens line. “I've previously ordered several pairs of glasses through Warby Parker, so they already had all my information. I just had to upload my new prescription (you can also renew online), place my order and then send the receipt to my vision insurance for partial reimbursement (they are considered out of network with my insurance). I will definitely be ordering from them again”, said Anna Gragert, wellness editor who has been using contact lenses for 17 years.Who this is for: Warby Parker is ideal for shoppers who value convenience, style and seamless online-to-offline experience. If you're someone who wants to shop for prescription glasses and contact lenses and get an eye exam all under one roof, Warby Parker is for you. It's also a great online shop for first-time contact wearers looking for simplicity.  ... Show more

Lens.com
Cheapest place to buy contact lenses online
Lens.com
Pros
Wide range of contacts brands
User-friendly checkout process
Cons
Is an out-of-network provider
Why I chose Lens.com: When researching for the lowest possible prices for contact lenses, I stumbled across Lens.com. The site consistently offers the cheapest prices I’ve seen online (even after factoring in the $9.95 shipping fee). Keep in mind that advertised prices reflect rebates, so it’s best to read the fine print. This site is for you if you’re willing to submit a rebate form in exchange for major savings.Lens.com also offers an online vision test. It is pricier than some competitors at $29.99, but the process is straightforward and you’ll receive the updated prescription within 24 hours. The site isn’t as up-to-date as other online contact retailers, but the value certainly makes up for it.Nick Hide, managing editor at CNET, says, “I'm incredibly short-sighted with severe astigmatism, so daily lenses can't completely correct my vision. I like having some to hand, though, in case my kids want to go swimming. I found Lens.com's online eye test easy to use and the correct lenses arrived quickly with no problems. I'd definitely use it again”.Who’s it for: Lens.com is for the budget-conscious shopper willing to put in a little work for the lowest final price. If you're shopping for a year's supply of lenses and don't mind sorting through mail-in rebates, you'll get the most savings with Lens.com. It's a solid pick for experienced contact lens wearers, students or anyone who has time to compare prices.  ... Show more

1-800 Contacts

1-800 Contacts
Best online contacts customer service
1-800 Contacts
Pros
Fast shipping and delivery
Discounts for new customers
Virtual Eye exams for renewals
Price match guarantee
Cons
Accepts only select insurance providers
Virtual exam may not be covered by insurance
Higher prices than discount sites
Why I chose 1-800 Contacts: 1-800 Contacts has saved some of my friends when they were down to the last pair and needed new contact lenses fast. The virtual prescription renewal is easy to use, and the customer service has always been top-notch. While it may not be the cheapest, it’s probably the most dependable on this list. Its Best Price Guarantee is also pretty seamless. If you find the same lenses cheaper on another site, you can contact customer service to honor the lower price, after a quick verification process through its 24/7 live chat. I also found the ExpressExam tool helpful for renewing your prescription without seeing an eye doctor in person. It takes about 10 minutes to complete on your phone or computer and costs $20. If you also wear glasses, you can get glasses on its sister website, The Framery, with the same prescription.“I bought my first pack of contacts through 1-800 Contacts in 2018, and I've never looked back. The price was significantly cheaper, and I received a solid discount for my first order. For two boxes of the six-pack Acuvue Contacts, I paid only $90. Compared to how much I would pay to order my contacts through my eye doctor, I saved over $160 for my first order with 1-800 Contacts. My favorite part is that the service is fast and delivers straight to my home. Generally, it takes me less than a week to receive my contacts,” said Trisha Jandoc, broadband writer.Who’s it for: 1-800 contacts is best for people who want unbeatable customer service and price protection. If you care about getting the lowest price guaranteed, need help navigating contact lens options or need to review your prescription online in minutes, 1-800 Contacts is the place for you.  ...

ContactsDirect
Best online contact lenses for using vision insurance
ContactsDirect
Pros
Huge selection of top contact lens brands
Frequent sales and promotions
Virtual vision test available
Cons
Some discounts may not stack with insurance
You need to buy a 12-month supply to get biggest discounts
Why I chose Contact Direct: What I like most about ContactsDirect is the ease of using your vision insurance at checkout. It’s one of the few online retailers where you can apply your insurance right on the site without filling out reimbursement forms. I also appreciate the wide selection of brands and the prices were affordable. ContactsDirect often sends out coupon codes to customers. It has a wide selection of lens options, including multifocal lenses, colored contacts, soft contact lenses for dry eyes, and toric lenses for astigmatism. It also offers a virtual vision test for $29 so you can renew your prescription. ContactsDirect, like 1-800 Contacts, offers price matching. It has to be the exact brand and product and in stock. You can provide a link to customer service and after a quick verification, they will match the price.ContactsDirect offers returns on products purchased within one year if your vision changes and you need a doctor's correction. My colleague, Josh Goldman, managing editor at CNET, told me, “I buy daily contact lenses for my teen son. ContactsDirect's website and buying process are simple and straightforward. Its prices are competitive and they frequently offer discounts. My insurance is accepted and shipping is free. It also partners with my credit card to offer cash back.”Who it's for: ContactsDirect is a top choice for those who value a seamless checkout with direct vision plan integration. If you're covered by VSP or EyeMed, you can apply your benefits online without submitting paperwork. It's also great for shoppers who value convenience, flexibility and name-brand lenses.  ...

Eyeconic
Best contact lens site for VSP and Metlife insurance
Eyeconic
Pros
Seamless integration with VSP and MetLife insurance
Frequently offers sitewide promotions
Large inventory of popular brands
Option to bundle purchases with glasses
Cons
No virtual prescription renewal offers
No virtual vision exam
Why I chose Eyeconic: I came across Eyeconic when looking for retailers that let you use VSP insurance without having to deal with reimbursement forms. Eyeconic, which is actually owned by VSP, makes the process pretty seamless. You log in, verify your benefits and the discount automatically applies at checkout. This makes it the most insurance-friendly platform I’ve seen so far.Eyeconic offers all of the most popular contact lens brands and often runs discounts you can stack with your insurance, leading to serious discounts. It also has one of the most generous return policies -- 60 days to return or exchange, even if the box is open.Joe Supan, principal writer for CNET, and who has been using contacts for 22 years, says, “I've been ordering contacts online for more than 10 years, and the main thing I'm looking for is ease. Eyeconic has always made it simple. It connects to my insurance during checkout, automatically applies my benefits, and gets them shipped to me within a week. What more could I ask for?”Who it’s for: Eyeconic is a strong choice for those with VSP and Metlife vision insurance and don’t want to deal with reimbursement processes. If you're covered by VSP or MetLife, Eyeconic lets you apply your benefits online during checkout. It's also great for people who like the security of working with a vision care provider that can connect them directly to a network of eye doctors.  ... Show more

Pros
Bifocal, progressive and multifocal lens selections are available
24/7 customer service
Offers sales and discounts
Vision test via app for $25
Seamless shopping if you also buy glasses
Cons
The return window is only 14 days
Doesn’t accept insurance directly
Some discounts exclude certain lens brands
Why I chose GlassesUSA: I initially researched GlassesUSA for glasses but was surprised to see its solid selection of contact lenses. Here, you can find most major contact lens brands, like DAILIES, Air Optix, Biofinity and Acuvue. The site also often runs aggressive sales or sitewide discounts, saving you money off your total cost if you time it right.I really like its virtual prescription renewal. You need to download the app, but it’s extremely easy to use, and you’ll get your renewed prescription within 24 hours. The site is pretty up-to-date, and I found the customer service responsive when I asked about applying a promo code.GlassesUSA doesn’t take insurance directly, but it provides itemized receipts for FSA or HSA reimbursement. They don’t have a super generous return window at only 14 days, so it’s best to double-check your prescriptions before placing an order, especially if it’s in bulk.Who it’s for: Glasses USA is best for those who already shop here for glasses and want a one-stop shop offering everything in one place. I think GlassesUSA will be especially appealing to deal-seekers who like coupon stacking, rotating promos and bundled offers. If you dread going into an optical for vision tests, you can also so this online with GlassesUSA and can renew your prescription online.  ... Show more

Best contact lens prices without insurance
Contact Lens King
Pros
Easy to reorder and offers auto-refill options
Occasionally offers promo codes
Keeps your prescription on file for future orders
Cons
Processing fees can bump up your total cost
Doesn't offer virtual exam or Rx renewal
Why I chose Contact Lens King: When price is the top priority, Contact Lens King comes out on top. I discovered it while comparison shopping and was surprised by some options' affordability. This site delivers if you have your prescription ready and want a good deal. You’ll need to manually upload your prescription, so this service is best for repeat orders. Note that for returns, you’ll need to request a return authorization before you send the unused and unopened box back, which isn’t as seamless as other retailers.Kellie Ernst, editor for CNET Money and a contact lens user for 25 years, said, “I've compared several online contact lens sites over the years, and this one consistently has the best prices on the contacts I get. I've also found their customer service to be very responsive. Once, I had a couple of torn contacts in a box I ordered, and Contact Lens King shipped me two replacement contacts. Just two individual contacts. I don't know if other sites would go through that hassle.”Who this is for: Contact Lens King is perfect for the budget-friendly shoppers looking for bottom-barrel deals on major lens brands. It's best for repeat customers who don't need extra services. college students or frequent buyers who want to stock up for the year. All in all, I recommend this site for people who want bare-bones service with a huge focus on savings, especially those who don't need insurance.  ... Show more

Why I chose Costco Optical: I’m a Costco fan through and through. It’s often my go-to for value, and its contact lens prices are unbeatable. The site isn’t flashy, but I was sold once I logged in and saw the discounts. As long as you are a member, this is one of the cheapest places to buy contacts online. I’ve also found Costco consistently offers the lowest prices for major brands like Acuvue, Air Optix and Biofinity. Additionally, you can save even more if you order in bulk, especially on quarterly or annual supplies. For even deeper discounts, Costco offers contact lenses from its proprietary brand, Kirkland. While Costco doesn’t offer virtual eye exams or the most high-tech on-site experience, the value is unbeatable.Katie Collins, editorial director at CNET, said, “Because I am prone to dry eyes, my eye doctor recommends a top-tier brand of daily disposable contacts. I've found only this brand (Acuvue Oasys Hydraluxe) to help my dry eye issue. My eye care insurance doesn't cover daily contacts, so I pay out of pocket. And I've found the cheapest place to buy contacts out of pocket is Costco (if you already have a membership).” She added that buying contacts here becomes affordable if you already have a membership and plan to use it for other shopping. She also mentioned that shipping isn't the fastest, sometimes taking up to two weeks to arrive. She cautions, “I wouldn’t rely on this service for fast shipping.”Who this is for: Costco Optical is ideal for existing Costco members who want affordable, bulk pricing on name-brand contacts and don't mind skipping frills like virtual eye exams or online returns. I think it's a great online contact lenses retailer for budget-conscious families or anyone who shops in bulk (or likes to buy annual supplies).  ... Show more

Regular discounts and promotions, especially with RedCard
Accepts most insurance providers
RedCard holders get an extra 5% off
Cons
No virtual eye exam

Why I chose Target Optical: If you’re already a Target regular, ordering contacts through Target Optical will make sense for you. The site is intuitive to navigate -- you can find the brand you're looking for, upload your prescription, and check out within minutes. Remember that Target Optical doesn't offer virtual eye exams, so you must have a valid prescription to buy contact lenses.I appreciate that it’s affordable and convenient. The prices may not be the cheapest, but with regular promotions, they can be competitive. Plus, let’s be honest -- it’s Target -- most of us feel more comfortable shopping somewhere reputable and easy to navigate.CNET’s fitness writer, Giselle Castro-Sloboda, says, “It's straightforward when submitting my prescription, and it also accepts many eye insurances.”Who this is for: Target Optical is best for busy shoppers who want affordable contacts and the added convenience of in-store pickup. It's especially great for RedCard holders who want to stack savings, families buying for multiple people and anyone who wants a one-stop shop for vision care, daily essentials and pharmacy needs.  ...

Moody
Pros

Collections are updated seasonally
Free shipping over $30
Vegan and cruelty-free materials
Cons
As "costume" lenses, they're not always as nice as traditional lenses
Contact lenses can be more drying, and you can't get fitted for them at the eye doctor
Why I chose Moody: If you’re looking for colored contacts that look natural, Moodylenses is the place for you. The site offers cosmetic lenses, with dozens of unique shades inspired by K-beauty and global trends.Unlike other colored contact lens brands, Moody shares information about base curve, diameter and lens material, which helps you feel more confident about wearability.

Colored contacts are available on Moodylenses with and without prescription. The site has a prescription verification system to ensure compliance with regulations. You can either send a copy of your valid prescription to Moody's customer service, or it can verify it directly with your eye doctor. Faith Chihil, Social Producer at CNET, told me, “I've found it's more cost efficient to buy cosmetic contacts online in my prescription, as they come in smaller quantities and it gives me a chance to change up my style. I'd rather pay $20 for five pairs of contacts in a cute design than $80 for a giant box that I might outgrow.”Who it’s for: Moodylenses is ideal for those interested in colored contacts (with or without prescription). Moody is made for shoppers who want to experiment with eye color. It's the go-to brand for beauty enthusiasts and K-beauty fans. I would recommend moody for trend-conscious users, influencers, makeup lovers who just anyone who loves to change up their look or self-expression.  ... Show more

How our experts choose the best place to buy contacts online
To determine the best online retailers for contact lenses, I evaluated a range of criteria to ensure quality, affordability and convenience. Our selection process included the following key factors:Variety of products: I assessed each retailer's selection to ensure they offer a wide range of contact lens brands, types and prescriptions -- including daily, bi-weekly and monthly lenses, as well as toric, multifocal and colored contacts.Pricing, price matching and discounts: Price transparency is crucial when shopping for contacts online. I compared base prices across multiple retailers and factored in available discounts, bulk savings, price matching, subscription plans and rebates. Shipping costs and speed: I examined shipping policies, considering standard and expedited shipping costs, processing times and order fulfillment speed,Return and exchange policies: I get it, mistakes happen -- so customers need the flexibility to return or exchange unopened or incorrect contact lens orders.I prioritized retailers with seamless return policies, clear refund procedures and responsive customer service to handle issues efficiently.Virtual prescription renewal: Since many contact lens wearers need an updated prescription before purchasing new contacts, I also considered a few retailers that offer online vision tests or telehealth services for prescription renewals.Insurance payment options: Many consumers rely on vision insurance or pre-tax benefits like HSAs and FSAs to offset costs. I reviewed which retailers accept insurance directly, provide reimbursement assistance or allow easy HSA or FSA payments at checkout.Website navigation and customer support: A seamless shopping experience is essential for me. I considered how easy it is to browse products, upload prescriptions and check out. I also prioritized online contact retailers with easy and clear customer support options. What to consider when buying contacts online
Shopping for contact lenses online can be convenient and cost-effective, but it's important to do some research before you order contacts online. Unlike buying in a store, you won't have immediate access to an optometrist for guidance, so taking a few key factors into account can help ensure you get the right lenses for your needs.Prescription and brand compatibility: Before you purchase your contacts online, be sure to have a valid contact lens prescription from your eye doctor. Additionally, it's best to stick to the brand and specification suggested by your doctor, as different materials, water content and oxygen permeability levels can affect comfort and eye health.Pricing and discounts: While online retailers often lower prices than brick-and-mortar stores, it's worth comparing costs across multiple sites. Look for discounts on bulk orders, subscription savings or rebates from manufacturers. However, be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true, as some unauthorized sellers may offer counterfeit or expired lenses.Shipping and return policies: If you wear contacts daily, factor in shipping times to avoid running out unexpectedly. Some retailers offer expedited shipping or auto-replenishment services for added convenience. Also, be sure to check the return policy in case you receive the wrong prescription, a damaged box or uncomfortable contacts. You'll want a hassle-free way to change or return your order.Customer reviews: Not all contact lens retailers are reputable. Choose sites that require a prescription verification process, have clear customer service policies and are approved by regulatory agencies like the FDA. Reading customer reviews can also give insight into the retailer's reliability, shipping times and overall service quality.Insurance and HSA/FSA eligibility: If you have vision insurance or a health savings account or flexible spending account, check whether the retailer you choose accepts them. Some sites allow you to apply your benefits directly at checkout, while others may require reimbursement. Taking advantage of these options can help you save on out-of-pockets costs. How to order contacts online
Buying contact lenses online is just as safe as buying them from your eye doctor, as you get the same lenses you'd find at the optical shop. The process requires a little extra effort than getting them from your eye doctor, but you'll be rewarded with savings.
To get started, you just need to follow a few easy steps.
Have your contact lens prescription. Search for the brand and model of contacts from your prescription at any of the stores above to find your specific lenses. Disposable contacts are sold in boxes, and most online shops give you a deal if you buy a six- or 12-month supply, rather than one box at a time. During the checkout process, you'll enter your prescription information to select the correct lenses and then submit verification of your prescription. Most stores allow you to upload an image or PDF of your prescription or you can opt for the company to contact your doctor to verify it. This process can take as little as a few minutes or up to a few days if the store contacts your doctor. Once that process is complete, your order will be finalized and cleared to ship directly to you. How to save money on contact lenses
Pro tip: Right after your contact lens exam, it's almost always worth it to get a year's supply of your current prescription. Regardless of whether you're buying daily disposable contacts, monthly lenses or even multifocal contacts, buying in bulk will help you save money.
If your prescription changes sometime during that year, many of the retailers above will allow you to exchange unopened boxes with a new prescription. You don't have much to lose by buying a full-year supply. Although it can be a higher up-front cost, you'll save money compared to buying one box at a time.
Tips to buy contacts online
If you are considering buying contacts online, keep these things in mind to ensure you make a safe purchase.
Be sure to have a valid prescription from your eye doctor. Whether you buy in a store or online, a prescription is required to ensure you get the correct prescription strength.Shop around at different online contact retailers to find the best deals and look at customer reviews.Double- and triple-check the details on your order before placing.Make sure you have (or also purchase) all of the care supplies you need to ensure the safety and longevity of your contacts.

Show more
Do you need a prescription to buy contacts online?

Before you start shopping, you'll first need to get an eye exam and contact lens prescription from your optician or optometrist.

What's the best place to buy contacts online?
With so many stores to choose from, how do you pick where to buy your contacts online? Here are some things to consider:
Price: Do some comparison shopping to figure out which store has the best price for your specific lenses. Prices can change often due to sales, promotions and manufacturer rebates, so the store that had the best deal last year might not have the lowest price now.Return policy: Many of the stores above allow you to return unopened boxes of contacts if your prescription changes. Check the terms of the store you're thinking of buying from to understand your options.Insurance coverage: Some online contact lens stores allow you to pay through your vision insurance, but some do not. If that's important to you, look for shops that accept your benefits.

Is it expensive to buy contacts online?
Contact lenses can be expensive, but you can save money by shopping for contacts online.  Disposable contacts will cost you more money in the long run than a pair of glasses. For example, Acuvue Oasys, one of the most popular brands of soft lenses, averages around $25 to $40 for a box of 12 lenses at the stores above. That box of 12 is enough for three months (one lens per eye, thrown away every two weeks). That adds up to around $160 per year for contacts. The full retail price for a 12-pack of Acuvue Oasys is listed as $103 on Lenscrafters.com, so you stand to save quite a lot of money by shopping around online.
Show more
Can you order specialty contact lenses online?
Yes, some online contact retailers offer specialty lenses. Specialty lenses are designed to address specific vision care needs, such as toric lenses for astigmatism or multifocal lenses to correct vision at multiple distances. They may require a more specialized fit tailored to your eye measurements. These sometimes require a contact lens fitting at your doctor's office to get the perfect fit. However, if you have a valid prescription, many online contact lens sites can provide various types of specialty lenses.
Show more
Is it safe to buy cheap contact lenses?
Cheap contacts aren't necessarily worse than their expensive counterparts. So it is okay to pick up a price-conscious pair. However, keep an "eye" out for how they feel during daily wear. If your eyes feel drier than normal or itch more, it might be worth considering an expensive pair.
