What to consider
Cost
First things first. What's your toothbrush budget? On the lower end, you can get a cheap electric toothbrush for $20 to $50, but it won't have certain features such as a lithium-ion battery or a sensor. A higher-ticket toothbrush in the $100-to-$200 range may have more features that may be worth it, but Dr. Yazdani suggests, "Pay more attention to the size and the type of bristles." He adds, "More expensive does not always mean more efficient cleaning, as there are many affordable options that can do the job."
Capabilities
What do you need the toothbrush to do? Maybe you just need one mode for cleaning a little deeper than you can with a manual toothbrush. Here are some toothbrush capabilities to consider:Timer: If you need help brushing for the dentist-recommended two minutes, it's a good idea to select a toothbrush with a built-in smart timer. It may buzz or stop brushing altogether after two minutes. Intensity levels: If you have sensitive teeth or sensitive gums, consider looking at the types of brush heads you can get for your electric toothbrush. Some models, like those from Oral-B or Sonicare, offer many different types of brush heads for different needs, such as brush heads for whitening, gum care and cleaning around braces. Some toothbrush heads have silicone bristles. It's all about your preference.Smart features: If you want a toothbrush that does more than just clean your mouth in one setting, look for a toothbrush with multiple smart features. The Oral-B iO series, for example, has five brush modes: daily clean, intense clean, whitening, sensitive and super sensitive. That brush also pairs with an interactive app that helps you track how much of your mouth you're cleaning. If you want to easily track your oral hygiene habits, go for a Bluetooth-enabled toothbrush with an app.Pressure sensors: If you have a habit of brushing your teeth a little too hard, it's smart to find an electric toothbrush with pressure sensors. Froum says, "One of the more important features for an electric brush is a pressure sensor that will shut the brush off if the person is brushing too hard." It may buzz or turn red if you press too hard, and this can help you learn and keep from harming your teeth and gums.
ADA seal of acceptance
If a toothbrush is ADA-accepted, this means the dental product is safe, effective and of high quality. The Oral-B Pro 1000 and Oral-B iO Series from this list are both ADA-accepted.
Convenience
Are you going to remember to replace your brush heads when it's time? If not, maybe a subscription-based electric toothbrush is right for you. Don't forget to look into how long a toothbrush holds its charge. The last thing you want is for your toothbrush to be dead when you're trying to get ready for bed; then you'd wish you had a regular toothbrush.

Care and maintenance of electric toothbrushes
"[Electric toothbrushes] can aid in proper scrubbing technique, reach hard-to-reach areas and provide controlled, consistent movements,” Dr. Jennifer Silver, a dentist in Calgary, Alberta, told CNET. What is the best overall electric toothbrush?
Caroline Igo/CNETSmart electric toothbrushes are a newer addition to the market, offering helpful insights into your brushing habits -- and even tips to improve your technique. Thankfully, they haven't gone full-AI just yet, though. A recent CNET survey found that 25% of phone owners don't find AI features useful, but that doesn't mean we can't all learn a thing or two about oral hygiene from our phones.To find the best electric toothbrushes, we tested 24 models over several weeks, considering design, functionality, price, modes and ADA recommendations for cleaner teeth and healthier gums.The Oral-B Pro 1000 is my top overall pick due to its competitive price, cleaning power, brush timer, oscillating head, soft bristles and affordable replacement brush heads. It is also ADA-accepted, meaning that the American Dental Association has deemed the brush safe and effective. I personally tested each electric toothbrush featured in this list, evaluating them against each other. Throughout each testing phase, considerations included design, functionality, cost, brush size, portability, speed settings, modes and the technology incorporated. Each toothbrush was used once in the morning and once at night for up to a week. The following are my top selections.Best electric toothbrush of 2025

Pros
Affordable brush and brush head replacements

Cons
Not as high tech as Philips Sonicare or iO Series
Only one brush mode
The Oral-B Pro 1000 electric toothbrush is a powerful and functional product with a lower price tag that really stands out. It has one daily cleaning mode and a two-minute timer that signals you to move mouth quadrants every 30 seconds.I tested the Oral-B Pro 1000 for a week, and it was my favorite product due to its simplicity and impressive cleaning abilities. I hardly had to scrub or brush my teeth on my own, the fast-spinning bristles did most of the work for me. It easily glided across my teeth. The smaller brush head also helped me to get to those hard-to-reach places. On top of that, the Oral-B Pro 1000 is ADA-accepted.   ... Show more

Best high-end electric toothbrush
Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige
Pros
Pressure sensors and automatically adjusts
Bluetooth capabilities with an impressive app
Reminds you to replace your brush head
Cons
Not for people who want a rotating brush head
Expensive
The Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige is a lifesaver if you have sensitive gums like me. I sometimes brush too hard, and the Philips Sonicare buzzes and lights up when I press down too hard with the toothbrush; a gentle nudge to let me know to lighten the pressure. The brush also automatically adjusts intensity if you're pushing too hard. The Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige has three different intensity modes and an app that shows your coverage. Similar to the app with the Oral-B iO Series, the display on your phone shows a 3D scan of your mouth and highlights the areas you are missing. The Sonicare app also guides you while brushing, and keeps track of your data, how much you are scrubbing (a big no-no with electric toothbrushes) and the pressure you are applying. Another great feature of this brush is the reminders. If you have trouble remembering when to replace your brush heads, Philips' BrushSync technology will tell you how long you've been using your brush head. A light on the handle will blink and the Sonic toothbrush will beep, letting you know it's time to order a new one.   ... Show more

Best sustainable electric toothbrush
Suri Electric Toothbrush
Pros
Sustainable design
Eco-friendly packaging
Recycling program
Cons
Pricier than other options
Lack of app connectivity
The SURI electric toothbrush redefines sustainable oral care by offering a product that prioritizes performance and environmental responsibility. The SURI toothbrush is built with a light aluminum body that can be repaired, refurbished or recycled. Its replaceable and fully recyclable brush heads help reduce waste (replacement heads come with a with a free pre-paid mailer bag made from compostable material so you can send back the used brush head to be recycled). The brush also has 30-second timers to let you know when it's time to move to another section of your mouth and automatically turns off after two minutes. The battery also lasts a bit longer than other electric toothbrushes I've tested (lasts up to 40 days). It's also pretty quiet at just 54dB.  ... Show more

Best affordable electric toothbrush
Philips One Rechargeable by Sonicare
Pros
Quiet and great for travel
Good for sensitive gums
Two-minute brush timer
Cons
Only one brushing mode
Doesn't come with an interactive app
I found the Philips One Rechargeable to be one of the gentlest of the brushes on this list, yet I still felt like my teeth were thoroughly cleaned with each use. I liked how small and lightweight it was.The brush head is slimmer than the Philips Sonicare brush but still similar to a manual toothbrush. The bristles are soft and flexible and the handle is small and light, the perfect fit for the palm of your hand. It only has one cleaning mode and a two-minute timer that turns off the brush once you reach that mark. The case it comes with is also one of the best parts of this brush. To store it, just flip the brush with its head down and pop into the case. The top flap closes and it is ready to go. I traveled with this brush on more than one occasion, and I specifically chose this brush to go with me due to its sleek design, quiet motor and the ease of slipping it into my bag.   ... Show more

Best electric toothbrush for infants
Pure Enrichment PureBaby Infant-to-Toddler Electric Toothbrush
Pros
Ideal brush for infant to toddler transition
Perfect size for toddler hands
Charge lasts a long time
Vibration isn’t too loud that it scares children
Cons
Could use more brush heads
There isn’t a cover to protect it from other grime in the bathroom
I’d been searching for a toothbrush for my 1.5-year-old but had no luck with the traditional brushes. He loves the Pure Enrichment PureBaby Infant-to-Toddler Electric Toothbrush. This toothbrush has improved my ability to brush my son’s teeth and keep him entertained while doing so. He’s also attempted to brush his own teeth because he finds the vibration and the light that shines from it to be fun. The helpful part is that this brush is designed to fit comfortably in a toddler’s hand. This brush comes with two brush heads, which are intended to be used as babies transition to toddlers. The silicone brush head is ideal for babies six months to a year, and it was the first attachment I tried with my son. The bristle brush head is intended for toddlers ages one to three, and the bristles are soft enough that they don’t hurt my son’s gums. I like how this brush has various speed options, and when he gets older and starts brushing independently, it has a two-minute timer. The PureBaby brush is also easy to recharge, but it can last awhile before it needs a charge. I’ve only charged it once since I received it, and it’s been over a month.  ... Show more

Best electric toothbrush for kids
Oral-B Kid's Color Changing Electric Toothbrush
Pros
Small handle and brush head
Available in two colors and comes with fun stickers for the handle
Two-minute timer
Cons
Not the same battery life as Oral-B adult brushes
Brush head replacements are more expensive than adults'
The Oral-B Kid's Color Changing Electric Toothbrush is my pick for the best electric toothbrush for kids. The handle feels small in my adult palm, so it's a good fit for little hands. The toothbrush has one gentle mode, comes in two colors and each box is equipped with stickers to decorate the waterproof handle. The soft, round brush head oscillates back and forth to clean the teeth, and the brush itself is a lot smaller than the usual Oral-B brush head. The two-minute coaching timer helps kids learn how long to brush their teeth. Also, the bristles of the brush head change from blue to white when it's time to replace the brush head.

Best smart electric toothbrush
Oral-B iO Series 5
Pros
3D teeth tracking, smart pressure sensor and LED indicator lights
Convenient travel case
ADA seal of acceptance
Cons
On the expensive side
The more I used this brush, the more I had to charge it
This Oral-B electric toothbrush is similar to other Oral-B brushes, except the bristles on this brush felt softer than the Oral-B Pro 1000. That's a big bonus for anyone with sensitive gums, as is the real-time coaching that tells you if you're brushing too hard. The Oral-B iO also has a quieter motor compared with the Pro 1000. The display offers an impressive amount of information. Based on the lit-up icon, you can easily tell what mode you're brushing in. The iO has five brush modes, whereas most electric toothbrushes seem to have three or four. You can choose from daily clean, intense clean, whitening, sensitive and super sensitive. The Oral-B iO Series is also ADA-accepted.   ... Show more

Quietest electric toothbrush
Philips Sonicare 4100
Pros
Small brush head can easily maneuver around the mouth
The power of Sonicare in a small, sleek brush
An extremely great value
Cons
Not as affordable as the Phillips One brush
Not for those who want large brush heads that cover more area
This Philips Sonicare brush is tiny but mighty. It is slimmer than the other Sonicare brushes on this list, and the handle is smooth and fits in the hand well. While this model doesn’t come with a traveling case, a stand or an interactive smart app, it does offer one of the quietest brushing experiences on this list. The Oral-B units can be a bit loud, but this Sonicare’s vibration is hushed, especially on the first cleaning mode.  While it may be quiet and missing extra smart features, the brush still packs a powerful cleaning punch. It cleans just as well as the brand’s high-end products. If you are interested in a traditional Philips Sonicare brush but don’t want to pay a hefty price tag, I recommend this model.   ... Show more

Best soft-bristled electric toothbrush
SuperMouth Ultim8 SmartBrush System
Pros
Quiet and sleek design
Light-up ring at the base of the brush head indicates correct and incorrect pressure
Two-minute brush timer and two sensitivity settings
Smart hub acts as brush head cleaner with UV sanitizing, drying and wireless charging
Cons
Using the smart hub as a carrying case is large and requires to be plugged in to activate cleaning mode
A travel case with the toothbrush and smart hub is an extra $30
Switching from a regular electric toothbrush to a sonic toothbrush for the first time, the movement of the soft bristles was deceiving at first. But after reading up more about appropriate hand movements with this kind of brush, I have found that this unit cleans teeth thoroughly and smoothly without tearing too deep into my teeth's enamel. The number of bristles and their thinness add to the smooth sensation of the action. I also like that the power button is located toward the bottom of the unit, avoiding accidental switch-offs during brushing. However, the pauses between sections in the 2-minute timer feel abrupt. I find myself turning the unit on one more time for an extra 30 seconds to brush parts that felt incomplete.  ... Show more

Most easy-to-use electric toothbrush
Oral-B iO Series 3
Pros
Most of the same technology as later iO Series at a lower cost
ADA seal of acceptance
Simple and straightforward modes and features
Cons
Doesn’t come with a travel case
Not for those who want an interactive app
The iO Series 3 is another excellent Oral-B option at a lower price than the highly-loved iO Series 6. It has the same round brush head that seems to cover and clean each tooth individually. My teeth feel the most clean when I use a round brush. It gets down to the gum line without being too intense. I also enjoy this brush's simplicity; it only has two buttons and three modes. It is extremely effortless to use. The LED light ring around the brush alerts you when you are pushing too hard. If you are looking for an app that tracks your brushing and areas you might be missing in your mouth, you will want to upgrade to the iO Series 6 or above. However, if you are looking for a simple Oral-B brush with a bit more cleaning power compared to the Pro 1000 (although the difference is slight) and something more affordable than the iO Series 6, then the Series 3 might be your middle ground.    ...

Best electric toothbrush with integrated smart coach
Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9300
Pros
Real-time coaching via app
Travel case included
Quiet, compared to other high-powered electric toothbrushes
Cons
High price tag at $230
Brush head replacements are pricey
Brushing my teeth with this smart toothbrush has become one of my favorite parts of my morning routine. The app syncs with the toothbrush in real time and corrects my techniques if I brush too hard or skip any areas. I also appreciate the sleek, minimalistic design and the glass charger cup, which goes well with any bathroom decor. If you like tracking your wellness habits, this toothbrush is for you, as you can see and track your progress in the app.The Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart 9300 is a step down in price from our pick for the best high-end electric toothbrush. If you are interested in the Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige, this might be a good alternative since both brushes come with smart sensors, many modes and Bluetooth capabilities to connect to a smart interactive app on your phone.

Best travel electric toothbrush
Quip Ultra Next Generation
Pros
Sleek, compact and weightless design
Dynamic touch bar allows you to control speed
Minimal grim and waste with changeable brush pods
Cons
Replacement heads are almost three times more expensive than normal
Not ADA accepted
Prior to testing, I was only familiar with Quip’s Sonic toothbrush. The Quip Ultra is a huge step up in terms of look, feel, technology and overall performance. It is made almost entirely of silicone and is one of the most cohesive, smooth and compact toothbrushes on this list. It stands out with its touch bar feature that controls the speed; I counted about 13 different speed levels. The Quip Ultra doesn’t have replaceable brush heads but brush pods. The neck of the brush stays intact, and only the bristles pop in and out. This way, there is less gunk hiding in your brush's little crevices. I did have to watch a video on how to successfully remove the brush pod (push up until it clicks and then turn it 90 degrees to pull it out), but then I was able to test changing the head. This is a very straightforward toothbrush with only one button and a touch bar. The travel case is just as sleek and small as the brush; it easily fits inside a suitcase, purse or backpack. I’ve traveled with this brush, and it is very convenient when my bags are overflowing with too much stuff.   ... Show more

Best electric toothbrush for sensitive gums
Moon Electric Toothbrush
Pros
Very gentle bristles that don’t irritate gums
Hardwear feels sleek, sturdy and high-quality in hand
Available in fun themes such as Hello Kitty and Barbie
Cons
Case is hard to open and prone to breaking
Not ADA approved
I have an extremely sensitive mouth, and an intense electric toothbrush can easily irritate my gums. When I first inspected the brush head on the Moon Electric Toothbrush, I was a little intimidated. It is twice as big as most of the brush heads on this list, yet I was pleasantly surprised at how gentle it felt on my teeth. The bristles are very soft and flexible; I never felt like they were tearing up my gums.   The handle is sturdy and feels as solid as an Oral-B or Phillips Sonicare product. Moon has more brush modes than most I have tested. The five include clean, white, polish, massage and sensitive. I used the clean and sensitive modes the most, but I found the first clean setting about as gentle and sensitive. The case it comes with is the biggest drawback to this product. It is very difficult to open, and I’ve hurt my fingers trying to pry it. I don’t recommend using the case; maybe find another carrier.  ... Show more

Best Amazon electric toothbrush
AquaSonic Black Series
Pros
ADA seal of acceptance
Includes eight replacement heads
Brushes similar to a Phillips Sonicare
Cons
Plastic brush heads feel cheap
Travel case is flimsy and can break easily
The AquaSonic Black Series electric toothbrush is similar to popular, high-end brands. Specifically, I think it’s a Phillips Sonicare dupe. Both brush heads are very similar and clean about the same; I even found that an AquaSonic head fit on a Phillips brush. While this brush is around the same price as the Phillips Sonicare 4100, you get a bit more bang for your buck. One, you get about eight replacement brush heads. That’s the most I’ve ever seen with any toothbrush I have ever tested. If you replace one every three to four months, that would last you almost two and a half years. The AquaSonic also has four different cleaning modes, while the Phillips only has two. Additionally, this Black Series comes with a travel case, although it’s made of thin plastic. There are quite a few lesser-known electric toothbrush brands on Amazon, although this has the be the best. The best part is that it has the ADA seal of acceptance -- something even a Phillips brush lacks. If you like the look and feel of a Sonicare brush and want better value out of your purchase, including spending less on replacement heads, the AquaSonic Black Series is for you.   ... Show more

Other electric toothbrushes tested
CNET/Caroline IgoThe electric toothbrushes in this section weren't my favorites, but they have some qualities worth mentioning. One of these might be the right choice for you, so we felt it was worthwhile to include them.Oral-B iO2Since I love the Oral-B iO Series 5 so much (it’s been my main toothbrush for over two years now), I was sent the new Oral-B iO2 electric toothbrush to test. It has the same brushing power and feel as the Series 5. It has three cleaning modes, a pressure sensor and a two-minute timer.My main concern, however, is that you can’t see the pressure light when you're brushing; you can’t even see it if you're looking in the mirror. Unless you have the front of the toothbrush flipped, you can’t see the green or red light on the power button telling you if you're brushing just right or too hard. I had to brush my teeth completely in the dark in order to watch the LED light change. But if this isn’t a drawback for you, the price is much nicer than the Series 5.   Oral-B iO2

Oclean X Ultra SWhen I first started testing this brush, I skipped over the instructions (which I don’t recommend). I must have pressed too hard while brushing because I suddenly heard a child’s voice come out of the device. To say it startled me would be an understatement. If I had read the instructions, I would have known that the Oclean X Ultra toothbrush has a pressure sensor that alerts you when you're pushing down on the device too hard. An AI child-like voice really does speak to you, but it’s muffled, and you can’t hear what “the brush” says. It also has an LED screen that shows you which quadrant of your mouth needs more attention or doesn’t get as clean as other areas. However, I tested just brushing one side of my mouth and the screen told me that I cleaned that area well, as well as another section of my teeth that I didn’t touch. It’s easy to see why the Oral-B iO Series 5 beats the Oclean X Ultra as the best smart electric toothbrush. Oclean X Ultra S

Burst Pro SonicBurst Pro Sonic is a popular electric toothbrush on Amazon. It has just over 7,000 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars out of 5. However, I was very disappointed with the feel of this brush. While the bristles are very soft, it has a piece of silicone in the middle of the brush head that I assume is used to scrap plaque and stuck-on food (the website doesn’t explain). This tiny piece felt too strange on my teeth.I think I could let this unfortunate design slide if the brush came in at a good price, but the Burst Pro Sonic retails for a little over $50. If you're already going to spend that much on an electric toothbrush, I recommend the Phillips Sonicare 4100.Burst Pro Sonic

Philips Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric ToothbrushFor ages 3 and up, the Philips Sonicare for Kids is just as great as Philips' other Sonicare models. The electric brush has two different modes and a brush timer and comes in two different colors. Plus, each box contains stickers to decorate the handle. It functions very similarly to the Oral-B Kid's Electric Toothbrush, although the brush head vibrates instead of oscillating.  The handle is heavier and about an inch longer than that of the Oral-B Kid's Color Changing toothbrush. The brush head is a smaller version of the Philips Sonicare Prestige but is still almost three times longer than the Oral-B Kid's brush head. What makes the Sonicare for Kids brush unique is that it has Bluetooth capabilities that connect to a smartphone app. I think the app is one of the best; it has educational videos and a tracking system that parents can use to see their kids' brushing behavior.Philips Sonicare for Kids

Quip Electric ToothbrushThe Quip brush head is very close to the size of a manual toothbrush head. The Quip is simple in every aspect: It has one speed and a two-minute timer that buzzes every 30 seconds and turns off once the time is up. That's it. There's no app, charger or wires. This electric toothbrush is powered by an AAA battery located in the handle and the charge lasts three months.I gave the Hum by Colgate the "best battery-powered electric toothbrush" title and not the Quip because I didn't like the brush head of the toothbrush. Yes, it's similar to a manual toothbrush but I found it hard to use to reach around my mouth. I also noticed that Quip's motor isn't very powerful compared with models from Sonicare or Oral-B. To me, it felt just like a manual cleaning. I didn't like that, but others may not mind. If you're looking for a smart electric toothbrush without Bluetooth or an app, the Quip may be the one.Quip

CariPro Electric ToothbrushThe CariPro is a good brush, it just didn't compare to the others on this list. The brush head vibrates and the top and bottom of the brush flare outward. My gums and teeth felt sensitive after using the CariPro, but I tend to experience dental sensitivity. It's hard to say if it was due to the brush bristles or the way the brush head flared out. If you have sensitive gums, note that the brush has five settings and one of which is a sensitive one. There's some good in this: I feel like the CariPro did a good job of cleaning my mouth. CariPro

Y-BrushThe Y-Brush turned heads and piqued interest at CES in 2017 and has come back to CES year after year. The strange, Y-shaped brush claims that it can brush all of your teeth in just 10 seconds. After applying toothpaste directly on the brush, the entire Y-Brush goes into your mouth. You then must bite down and press the button to activate the gentle vibrations. After five seconds, you can move to your lower set of teeth. I not only found that the Y-Brush didn't clean my teeth but that the vibrations hurt my head. It was an uncomfortable experience that simply left my teeth coated in toothpaste. But the concept of this brush is fun and interesting and it might be for you if you're tired of ordinary electric toothbrushes. Y-Brush

Oral-B Pro 500 Precision CleanMy experience with the Oral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean brush compared with some others in the same price range. It has one cleaning mode and the brush head oscillates and rotates on a two-minute timer. The brush alerts you when you're finished, too. This simple Oral-B brush is basic and doesn't have any special technology or paired apps.Out of all the Oral-B brushes I tested with rotating spin heads, I liked this one the least. It wasn't as powerful as the others and after a few uses, I found myself wondering if I needed a new brush head. I think this brush is perfect for someone testing out an electric toothbrush for the first time. It is simple and very reasonably priced. I would personally choose the Oral-B Pro 1000, but this Pro 500 is a good budget option. Oral-B Pro 500 Precision Clean

Feno SmartbrushSimilar to the Y-Brush above, the Feno Smartbrush is also a mouthpiece-like brush that uses vibrating bristles to clean your teeth. It’s basically the Y-Brush with added AI features and a larger range to clean all your teeth -- top and bottom -- all at once. It’s also more personalized. You upload a picture of your mouth to the Feno app and then receive personal molds designed to reach all your teeth. A corresponding app connects to the device to show you areas where you might be missing and offer dental advice.    I have a very tight and small jaw, so this brush was uncomfortable for me to use. I also couldn’t justify the price when a less expensive brush could clean my teeth better. However, a CNET contributor had a different experience. She found it “a mouthful… in a good way.”Feno Smartbrush

Hum by Colgate This brush has three modes: normal, sensitive and deep clean, and it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know when to move on to another quadrant of your mouth. The charger is small and easy to travel with, as is the carrying case, which can hold two brush heads. One of the best features this brush offers is the guided brushing feature within the app, which tells you how good (or bad) a job you're doing. It offers encouragement and reminds you that you can earn rewards for brushing better. It might sound silly, but the experience really did make me want to brush better.While it originally made our list, this brush has been discontinued. You can still buy it on Amazon, but the replacement heads are unavailable. Hum

Electric toothbrush vs. manual
The ADA also says that both electric and manual toothbrushes effectively remove plaque, but there are key differences. Electric toothbrushPros:The elderly, children, or people with dexterity impairments or disabilities may find it easier to useCan be better at hitting hard-to-reach spotsBuilt-in pressure sensors alert you when you're brushing too hardCons:More expensiveRequire batteries or charging Manual toothbrushPros:Relatively cost-effectiveVery easy to findCons:You can brush too hard, damaging your teeth's enamelEasy to miss spots in your mouthYou can brush for less than two minutes if not paying attentionBoth electric and manual toothbrushes help you clean your teeth, avoid gingivitis and improve gum health. Regardless of which brush you choose, don't forget to floss before brushing your teeth. "If you are unsure about the best option for your at-home oral health routine, consider consulting your dentist for advice," says Dr. Yazdani. Care and maintenance of electric toothbrushes
Caring for an electric toothbrush is different from caring for a manual one. Although both brushes require you to rinse off the head after each use, the head of electric toothbrushes should be detached and cleaned separately. Wipe it down and then wipe off the handle. Put the head back on the body of the brush and let it dry. Also, store your electric toothbrush standing up straight so it can dry between uses. Periodontist Scott H. Froum says, "storage of the device in a non-wet or humid environment is important." A bathroom cabinet is a good place. Dr. Silver also reminds patients, "Periodically, the toothbrush handle should be cleaned." One should be careful: "Avoid exposing or submerging the [entire] toothbrush [handle] in water, as it can damage the internal components," she adds. Lastly, and most importantly, replace your electric brush head every three months. Replace it earlier if the bristles are fading or fraying.
Best electric toothbrush FAQs
What is the best electric toothbrush?
The best electric toothbrush on this list is the Oral-B Pro 1000. It's cost-effective, ADA-accepted, has a pressure sensor and alerts you on brush time. The best electric toothbrush is ultimately whichever works best for you. Consider cost, pressure sensors, smart features, intensity levels and ADA seal of approval.If you have sensitive gums, look for an electric toothbrush that has a gentle setting, like the Quip or CariPro. If you're looking for a deep clean, a spinning electric toothbrush head like that found on the Oral-B may be for you. Consult your dentist if you have questions about which type may be right.
Is it OK to use an electric toothbrush every day?
Yes, but make sure you're using it correctly. If you brush your teeth with too much pressure, you run the risk of damaging your enamel or gums.
How much should I spend on an electric toothbrush?
Electric toothbrushes can be expensive. A quality, low-cost electric toothbrush can run you anywhere from $25 to $40. If you are looking for a high-end electric toothbrush with all of the recent technology, you can expect to pay anywhere from $150 to $300.
Which works better: a sonic or rotating electric toothbrush?
The best toothbrush is the one you’ll use consistently. Companies often fund studies to compare performance, but results can be skewed based on who conducts them. As long as you brush for two minutes a day and use your electric toothbrush correctly, you’ll maintain good dental hygiene.
