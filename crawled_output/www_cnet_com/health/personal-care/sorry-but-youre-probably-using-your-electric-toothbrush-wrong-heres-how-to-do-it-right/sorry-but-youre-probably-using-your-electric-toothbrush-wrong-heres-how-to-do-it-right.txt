Brushing your teeth twice a day might seem like a mindless activity, and during those two minutes, you might space out or watch videos on your phone. This is especially the case when using an electric toothbrush, as many assume that it does all the work for them. However, if you stop paying attention to what you're doing when brushing your teeth, it's easy to do it wrong and make mistakes.
Whether you've just switched to an electric toothbrush or are teaching a child how to use one, we outline the steps to brushing correctly and common mistakes you might make. After all, no one wants to deal with the consequences of brushing incorrectly at their next dentist visit. Best Electric Toothbrushes

How to use an electric toothbrush correctlyReady to make the switch to a powered toothbrush? Or, are you ready to learn how to correctly use yours? Fortunately, using one of these brushes is relatively simple and will take no more work than using a manual toothbrush. Make sure your toothbrush is charged. Your electric toothbrush should have an indicator that lights when it is charged. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle and begin brushing the outside surfaces of your teeth. Hold the brush's rotating heads against each tooth for 2 to 5 seconds before you move on to the next. After brushing the outer surfaces of your teeth, move to the inside surfaces, holding your brush's rotating heads against these surfaces for two to five seconds before moving on to the next. Next, hold your brush's head against the chewing surfaces of your teeth. Hold your brush against these surfaces for a few seconds each before moving on to the next tooth. You're not done yet. Run the rotating heads of your electric toothbrush along your gum line and on your gums. This will remove any remaining plaque in your mouth. As a final step, gently brush the roof of your mouth and tongue. This is a good way to remove stubborn food particles, and brushing these areas of your mouth can also help freshen your breath.
sergeyryzhov/Getty ImagesCommon mistakes made when using an electric toothbrushWhile it's easy to use an electric toothbrush, there are still mistakes you should avoid when brushing your teeth. Here are the most common: Not brushing long enoughDon't rush your brush. The ADA recommends brushing your teeth for 2 minutes twice a day with a brush with soft bristles. Rushing this makes it more likely that you won't scrub away enough of the plaque that builds on your teeth. Not replacing a worn toothbrush headDon't overuse the heads of your electric toothbrush. The ADA recommends you change these heads every three to four months. If the bristles on these heads are frayed or matted, you should immediately replace them, even if you've used them for less than three months.Brushing too hardYou might be tempted to push down hard when you brush your teeth, but this can have detrimental effects on your teeth and gums. Brushing too hard can wear down your gums and teeth. That could reduce the enamel on your teeth, making them overly sensitive to hot or cold temperatures. Brushing too hard could also cause your gums to recede. Using the wrong toothbrushYou can brush your teeth effectively with both an electric and a manual toothbrush. You will need to use the right brush. The ADA recommends using a toothbrush with soft bristles and a long handle that allows you to reach the back of your mouth. Do you want to make sure your toothbrush is up to snuff? Look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance. Brushes approved by the American Dental Association feature a seal on their packaging.
Peter Dazeley/Getty ImagesElectric toothbrush benefitsThere are several advantages to using an electric toothbrush, like manageability and effectiveness. Here are some of the most important: Electric toothbrushes might be more effectiveStudies have shown that electric toothbrushes may more efficiently prevent tooth decay. In 2014, the Cochrane Collaboration studied 56 clinical trials of unsupervised toothbrushing by more than 5,000 subjects, both adults and children. Researchers found that those who used an electric toothbrush for one to three months saw a reduction in plaque of 11% when compared to those who used a manual toothbrush for the same amount of time.Another study that followed adults for 11 years also found that participants who used an electric toothbrush had healthier teeth. The 2019 study, conducted by researchers at the University of Medicine Greifswald in Germany, found that those who used electric toothbrushes had healthier gums and kept 19% more teeth throughout the study than those who used manual brushes.A better choice for young childrenChildren often struggle to clean their teeth properly with a manual toothbrush. They might get bored before they've finished brushing for the recommended 2 minutes, making it easier for plaque to build on their teeth. An electric toothbrush can help. Because the heads of such brushes rotate in different directions, they provide more brushing power and can more effectively remove plaque in a shorter time. Some electric toothbrushes have built-in timers, letting younger children know when they've hit that 2-minute mark. Oral-B Battery Powered Kids Toothbrush

More effective at removing plaque if you have bracesDo you have braces? If so, an electric toothbrush might be the better choice for your dental health. A study by the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics found that participants who used a manual toothbrush after getting braces were more likely to accumulate more plaque and an increased risk of gingivitis than those who used electric toothbrushes.Better at removing plaque in generalYour goal when brushing your teeth is to remove as much plaque as possible. That's because the bacteria in plaque eat away at your teeth's protective enamel. Your teeth are more likely to suffer decay, and you're more likely to experience painful cavities if you don't remove this plaque. Easier to use for someAn electric toothbrush might be easier to use for people with chronic pain or disabilities. That's because the brushes' rotating heads do most of the brushing. With manual toothbrushes, you have to do the brushing work yourself.
