How we test
What to consider
Purpose
Eye drops may be designed to treat dryness, redness or other eye issues. Some conditions require prescription eye drops instead of over-the-counter ones.
Ingredients
Make sure to look at the active ingredients in your eye drops -- some chemicals can cause issues in the eyes over time.
Preservatives
Depending on how often you plan to use the eye drops and what you're using them for, a preservative-free brand may be best. Also, some preservatives are safer than others.

iVizia Sterile Lubricant Eye Drops for Dry Eyes
Pros
Multipurpose for different eye issues
Filter prevents contamination
Drops are small to avoid waste
HSA/FSA eligible
Cons
Expensive
Why we like it: The iVizia eye drops are a favorite among ophthalmologists. These artificial tear eye drops come in a small bottle and are intended for dry eyes, but they're multipurpose and can work for just about any eye issue. Dr. Thomas Stokkermans, an optometrist and medical reviewer at All About Vision, said, "These drops have one of my preferred lubricants in it known as povidone and the high-technology dispenser has a filter in it to prevent contamination, and allows the artificial tears to be preservative-free and dispensed from a multiuse container." Who it's best for: According to Dr. Natalya Rooney, optometrist and owner of Merrick Avenue Optometry, another great aspect of these drops is their versatility and efficiency. "These drops can also be used with contact lenses and the size of the drop is smaller than other artificial tears which makes it easy to not waste drops," she said. One user Amazon user with a condition that causes complete eye closure and dryness said IVIZIA is the only eye drop that has helped them. "For the price, longevity and comfort, IVIZIA is my absolute favorite."  ... Show more

Best over-the-counter eye drops for dry eyes
Systane Complete PF Eye Drops
Pros
Good for dry and sensitive eyes
Free of preservatives
Pregnancy-safe
HSA/FSA eligible
Cons
Expensive
Why we like it: Systane is a trusted brand recommended by optometrists for those with dry eyes. As someone who's struggled with dry eye symptoms, this product is my usual go-to. The Systane eye drops come in a small bottle and work for up to eight hours and are ideal for dry, sensitive eyes. The bottle is designed to dispense nano droplets so you don't waste any product. They’re also safe for regular use, as they’re free of preservatives and carry a lower risk of toxicity.Who it's best for: Dr. Koetting said she likes these drops for all kinds of dry eyes, and they're also safe to use during pregnancy, which can bring on a case of dryness. One user on Amazon raves about Systane eye drops and claims they're the only eye drops that work for them. They use the drops morning, afternoon and evening and said, "I notice almost instant relief, and I really do like the design of the dropper because it minimizes the drop that I have to put in my eye and increases the life of the bottle."  ...

Best over-the-counter eye drops for red eyes
Lumify
Pros
Reduces eye redness right away
Reduces pressure and fluid in eyes
FSA eligible with doctor's note
Cons
You need doctor clearance first
Expensive
If you're prone to red eyes, it's important to know what's causing them before self-medicating. Koetting said that "if someone has red eyes, it is typically a symptom of something else, such as more severe dry eye disease and is a good idea to see an eye care professional, especially if there is any sudden pain with it." Dr. John Sheppard, an ophthalmologist and professor of ophthalmology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, agrees and advises avoiding vasoconstrictor eye drops with naphazoline, a decongestant that's usually found in OTC eye drops like Visine or Clear Eyes. This ingredient is also known to restrict blood flow, which can cause high blood pressure. Why we like it: "These types of drops induce dependency, so I prefer Lumify," said Dr. Sheppard. If you've cleared with your doctor that it's appropriate to use OTC drops for redness, Lumify is a solid choice. Lumify is a small bottle that contains brimonidine, which is commonly used in glaucoma medication. It also helps reduce pressure and fluid in the eyes. Who it's best for: As long as you aren't dealing with an infection or other medical complication, Lumify is safe to use, especially if you're looking to reduce eye redness fast. One Amazon, one reviewer loves Lumify because of how quickly it works, saying, "They work incredibly fast -- within minutes, my eyes go from red and tired to bright and refreshed." Additionally, he likes that it doesn't cause rebound redness, unlike some other brands.  ... Show more

Pros
Contact lens-friendly
Can be used before and after contact insertion
OcuPure preservative transforms into natural tears
FSA/HSA eligible
Cons
Should get doctor clearance first before use
Has preservatives if that's something you're trying to avoid
Why we like it: If you use contact lenses, you're probably used to having dry eyes when you wear them for too long. That's why it's important to rewet them throughout the day. Blink eye drops come in a small bottle and are popular lubricating eye drops for contact lens users. These drops can be used before inserting your contacts or after. Blink contacts aren't preservative-free and include an ingredient known as OcuPure which is a gentle oxidative preservative made up of sodium chloride and other ingredients that transform into natural tear components in the eye.Who it's best for: This is one of Dr. Stokkermans' top eye drop picks. "I like Blink Contacts because it has a good preservative [OcuPure] that does not cause as much eye problems," he said. If you're not sure if Blink Eye Drops are right for your contact needs, consult with your eye doctor first. One Amazon user who is a fan of the drops loves that these eye drops save them from the dry weather in their hometown. "It is easy to use and pop into your pocket to have at all times because you never know when you will need it with contacts ... living in the desert!"

Best over-the-counter eye drops for post-eye surgery dryness
Systane Hydration PF Eye Drops
Pros
Single use vials
Ideal for post eye surgery
FSA/HSA eligible
Cons
Expensive
Why we like it: I personally like the single vials Systane offers: They're easy to toss in your bag when you're on the go and they're less wasteful. Systane's Hydration PF eye drops differ from our other top pick, Systane Complete PF eye drops, because the former is more for those who need to regularly hydrate their eyes during recovery. These hydration drops are Koetting's top pick for patients who've had LASIK eye surgery because they provide long-lasting relief and have the necessary extra moisturizing hydration components. One Amazon user swears by these drops and says the hydration works well for him, saying: "I have tried about 10 different drops over the past four or five years for my dry eyes and Systane Hydration works the best for me." He adds: "They have a longer shelf life once they’re open than most due to the design of the bottle cap."Who it's best for: One of the post-surgery side effects of LASIK or cataract eye surgery is dry eyes. Systane’s Hydration PF eye drops are a safe choice to help relieve dryness after eye surgery.  ... Show more

Best over-the-counter eye drops for allergies
Pataday Once Daily Relief Allergy Eye Drops
Pros
Great for allergy sufferers
FSA/HSA eligible
Cons
Can't be used with contacts
Requires some time to work
Expensive
Why we like it: "Pataday extra strength is a pretty effective drop and all you need to do is apply it once daily to each eye," Dr. Rooney said. If you're uncertain if Pataday will work for your allergy condition, remember to consult your doctor in case you are a better candidate for a medicated option. One Amazon user who is loyal to Pataday said they were dealing with dry eyes caused by allergies until they tried Pataday. They said, "My optometrist suggested I try Pataday and I gave it a few weeks before I started really noticing something." They added that it's been a bit over a month now and they can comfortably wear my contacts again without experiencing dryness. Who it's best for: Allergy sufferers know that allergy season can wreak havoc on eyes. That's why having dependable eye drops on hand can be helpful. Pataday Once Daily Relief Allergy Eye Drops come in a small bottle and are recommended by physicians because they contain an antihistamine that offers fast symptom relief for mild to moderate allergies. They can tackle indoor and outdoor allergens like dander, pollen, ragweed and grass. If you use contact lenses, it's not advised to use these drops while wearing them, and if you do, you should wait 10 minutes after application before inserting them.   ... Show more

Best over-the-counter overnight eye drops
Optase Hylo Night Dry Eye Ointment
Pros
Preservative-free
Ideal for those with certain sleeping conditions
Ideal for people with moderate to sever eye dryness
HSA/FSA eligible
Cons
Some people may not like the tube
Expensive
Why we like it: The Optase Hylo Night Dry Eye Ointment comes in a tube and is a favorite of Koetting, who recommends this preservative-free drop meant for patients with certain sleeping conditions. "For those who have a CPAP machine or may sleep with eyes partially open, this ointment in particular is good because it has Vitamin A to help heal the front surface," she said. Optase is safe for everyday use and is applied to the eyelids before bed. People with moderate to severe dry eyes may find relief using this ointment regularly. If your eyes don't seem to improve after some time, speak with your doctor to find a better or stronger solution. On Amazon, a user with thyroid eye disease claims that Optase is the only eye ointment that has worked for them. They said, "I have TED and my eyelids no longer close all the way so nighttime eye ointment is now an everyday part of my life. I have tried all the over the counter brands and this brand is by far hands down the best."Who it's best for: Sometimes overnight drops are necessary when your eyes need extra lubrication. Overnight drops are different from your standard eye drops. "Oftentimes a thicker gel or ointment may be recommended for overnight eight-hour relief while sleeping," said Dr. Nathan Lighthizer, an optometrist and associate dean at the Northeastern State University Oklahoma College of Optometry.   ...

How we evaluated the best eye drops
We consulted with six ophthalmologists and optometrists who prescribe eye drops to patients regularly and are familiar with the many over-the-counter eye drop brands on the market. We compiled their expertise and recommendations, which were based on ingredients, safety, ease of use, versatility and other factors. What to consider when choosing eye drops
Before buying any type of eye drops, it's important to speak with your doctor so they can evaluate your issue. In some cases, OTC eye drops are sufficient, but in other situations, you may need prescription medicated drops. If your issue can be resolved with OTC eye drops, you should know that there are drops with preservatives and others without them. The preservative-free eye drops are generally safe for most people -- including pregnant people. Drops with preservatives should be used more conservatively because they can worsen some cases. The same is true for other drops, such as the ones for redness relief."Poor-quality artificial tears, or ones that tout the red out, often have chemicals that can cause problems including rebound redness, dilation of the eyes, corneal toxicity, blurred vision and worsening of dry eye disease," Koetting warned.Dr. Edmund Farris, an associate clinical professor of ophthalmology at Mount Sinai, added that these preservatives have the ability to change aspects of the eye. He said, "the preservatives in most drops can alter the corneal surface and cause loss of these superficial corneal cells, which may eventually lead to more symptoms." So if you're using these types of drops too often, this can become an issue. Some signs to look out for if you think you're having a negative reaction to eye drops include redness that gets worse, irritation, blurred vision and a burning or grittiness sensation. Often times this occurs due to the preservatives found in some drops. Koetting said that if these symptoms don't improve, it can indicate an allergy or sensitivity to the drops. "However, if a person notices that they are having an increase in itching, swelling around the eye or the whites of the eyes become swollen and red, they should immediately discontinue the drop and call an eye care professional," she added.  When eye drops aren't enough
In some cases, you may need steroids or other medicated treatments if OTC eye drops are not doing their job. "Oftentimes, dry eye disease has multiple causes, and will take multiple treatments to see improvement," Dr. Lighthizer said. He added that a patient with mild to severe dry eye may require multiple treatments, including OTC artificial tears (usually preservative-free) along with a prescription dry eye drop. According to Koetting, a good rule of thumb to follow is if the symptoms have minimal improvement over two weeks or if you find yourself using over-the-counter artificial tears more than twice a day.
Different forms of dry eye treatment
There are various ways to treat dry eyes, and what works for you will depend on what's causing your dry eyes. Below are the different ways you can treat dry eyes.Over-the-counter drops: This is one of the immediate ways to treat dry eyes since many drops are fast-acting and are usually safe to use regularly. Home remedies: Sometimes home remedies can help relieve itchy eyes. You can use a warm compress, avoid sitting near a fan or air conditioner, drinking more water, getting better sleep and more. Prescription drops: If your dry eyes are severe enough that over-the-counter drops can't fix the issue, your doctor will most likely prescribe a specialized drop to help you.
