If you're looking at professional teeth whitening for your dental care, you might know it's an expensive service. It can cost anywhere from $300 to $1,000. There's no surprise that many people turn to over-the-counter strips, kits and toothpaste to brighten their smiles. "Think of whitening strips as tiny chemistry labs for your teeth," says Dr. Karen Man, dentist and chief dental officer of SmileGrove Dental. "They’re coated with hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which are fancy names for bleaching agents that break apart stain molecules." To see which ones actually work, we tested a variety of products to find the best teeth whitening strips based on fit, active ingredients, ease of use, wear time and strip count. Our Picks

What is the best teeth whitening strip overall?
AmazonCrest 3D Whitestrips are our pick as the best teeth whitening strips overall because our tests determined that they had the best results with the most effective active ingredients. If you have surface stains from years of tea, coffee and wine consumption, the whitening agent in Crest 3D Whitestrips can effectively whiten teeth by as much as 23 levels.But health comes before vanity, so check with your dentist first -- especially if you have a history of enamel erosion or need dental work such as filling a cavity. You should also take precautions when using whitening strips if you have crowns, veneers or fillings, as whitening products may affect these differently.Best teeth whitening strips of 2025

Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects
Pros
Up to 23 levels of whiter teeth in about 24 days (the most on this list)
Remove up to 15 years of stains
Active ingredient is 10% hydrogen peroxide
Cons
You might find the coverage to be less than you want
Most expensive on this list at $45
Why we like it: Crest 3D Whitestrips are truly a classic. They're easy to find and easy to use and I've bought them many times. Each Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects box contains 48 strips for 24 treatments. Wear one strip a day for 30 minutes and Crest claims that you can remove up to 14 years of stains by the end of your last treatment.  Who is it best for: These whitening strips are best for someone who wants up to 23 levels of whiter teeth in about 24 days using the active ingredient hydrogen peroxide. Who should not get it: One thing to keep in mind is that the coverage is a little less than other brands on this list. I found that it was OK, I just wished the strips would reach over my canines more. They are also the most expensive at $45. Despite that, Crest 3D is still my No. 1 on this list because they're effective time and time again.  ... Show more

Best dissolving whitening strips
Moon Dissolving Whitening Strips
Pros
Dissolves within 15 minutes, so no extra waste
Vegan and cruelty-free
A refreshing mint flavor
Cons
On the expensive side at $40
Must avoid eating and drinking for 30 minutes after application
Why we like it: If you don’t like the feeling of whitening strips sitting on your teeth for up to 30 minutes, you can try dissolving strips, instead. Moon Dissolving Whitening Strips are applied just like any other strips but after 15 minutes, they dissolve. There’s no unnecessary waste or mess and no need to rinse. The strips are also peppermint flavored.Who is it best for: Moon states that in two weeks or less, you can whiten your teeth up to seven shades lighter. In addition to being vegan and cruelty-free, these dissolving whitening strips are free of SLS/SLES (which can irritate skin), triclosan, parabens and artificial flavors.Who should not get it: These are the third most expensive whitening strips on this list at $40, so if that's not in your budget, you may want to find a more affordable product or one that's on sale.

Best whitening strips for sensitive teeth
Lumineux Oral Essentials Whitening Strips
Pros
Natural alternative -- coconut oil is the active ingredient
Contains 21 treatments in one box
Up to 14 shades lighter in a maximum of three weeks
Cons
On the pricey side at $45
May slip around
Why we like it: Anyone who has sensitive teeth should check out Lumineux Oral Essentials. Lumineux products don't include hydrogen peroxide and instead use a combination of Dead Sea salt, essential oils, coconut oil and aloe vera. The fit and coverage were great, although they did slip around a bit. Lumineux products are also cruelty-free.Who is it best for: I tested these for three consecutive days, so I can't speak to the long-term efficacy compared with other brands. But Lumineux did conduct a clinical trial that concluded Crest 3D Whitestrips were no more effective than Lumineux natural whitening strips. (The study was funded in part by Lumineux, however.) Still, I think they're worth a shot for people with sensitive teeth and gums.Who should not get it: Like the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects, these whitening strips are also $45, which is on the more expensive side.

Cons

May not be suitable for sensitive teeth
Has only 14 treatments, the lowest on this list
Why we like it: Zimba whitening strips are affordable and effective at lightening the shade of your teeth. One pack comes with 28 strips for results in 14 days or less. Wear one strip for 30 minutes a day.Who is it best for: This cruelty-free brand has found a way to combat one of the negatives of whitening strips -- the strong, bitter taste. Zimba offers 10 flavors to choose from, including watermelon and spearmint. On top of that, the strips have a nonslip design that grip your teeth during each treatment.Who should not get it: The most affordable on this list ($25), this product comes with the fewest treatments: 28 strips for 14 treatments. If you're looking to get the most treatments out of your purchase, the Moon Dissolving Whitening Strips offer the highest number, 28 treatments.  ... Show more

How we tested the best teeth whitening strips
I began this list of teeth whitening strips with teeth whitening products that could potentially make it into this roundup, looking at factors like brand reputation, buyer reviews on Amazon and full reviews by other writers. After narrowing the lengthy list of teeth whitening strips, I started testing.It would be impossible to test the long-term efficacy of all of these whitening strips without annihilating my enamel and gum tissue or distinguishing results with back-to-back testing on my own teeth, so I judged each product against a few criteria that I think will help you make a buying decision. Factors to consider when choosing teeth whitening strips
Before buying your next box of teeth whitening strips, consider these factors.FitYou want your strips to fully cover your teeth and not go up over your gums, which can cause gum sensitivity. Additionally, their fit should be snug. While you go about your day waiting for it to be time to take the strips off, they should not slip and slide inside your mouth.CoverageWhile whitening your molars is not necessary (since you hardly see them anyway), your teeth whitening strips should still cover a good percentage of your teeth. After you apply the strip, smile and look in the mirror. Is the strip touching all of the teeth you can see in your normal smile? If not, time to try another brand.Ease of useWhitening strips should be simple. Apply the product, wait a specified amount of time and take the strips off. If the teeth whitening strips require other steps or seem difficult to use, try another brand.SensationsIf you have sensitive teeth or gums, look for products that will give you the least amount of sensitivity. Oftentimes, hydrogen peroxide is too strong for sensitive teeth, so try coconut oil, instead. Don’t suffer through a product if it burns your gums or hurts your teeth.Length of wearMost strips require at least 30 minutes of wear in order to get the best results. If you have sensitive teeth or not enough time for teeth whitening strips, look for products that don’t require much wear. How do teeth whitening strips work?
"Over-the-counter teeth whitening strips contain low to moderate concentration of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide gel. The peroxide penetrates the tooth enamel to break down stain molecules," explains Sandip Sachar, DDS, who has been practicing general and cosmetic dentistry in Midtown Manhattan, NYC, for over 20 years. "Whitening strips often include advanced adhesives that keep the strip and peroxide in close contact with the teeth. They can gently lighten the tooth color after repeated applications. Typically, it takes 5-14 daily applications to achieve satisfactory results."After about a week of daily use, according to Man, most people start seeing their teeth get noticeably whiter. Are teeth whitening strips safe?
"Generally, yes, but they’re not right for everyone," answers Man. "The FDA regulates these products, and many have the American Dental Association’s seal of approval. However, people with certain dental conditions like cavities, gum disease or very sensitive teeth should check with their dentist first. Even healthy teeth can become sensitive during whitening."Man states that problems tend to occur when people are unaware of underlying dental issues or don't follow the product directions. "If you experience persistent pain or sensitivity, stop using them and see your dentist," she advises.According to Sachar, DIY products can be riskier. "These include products that contain chlorine dioxide or sodium chlorite, which can thin enamel and increase the risk of tooth decay," she says. "These are not ADA-approved ‘natural’ or ‘fast-acting’ whitening products, and I do not recommend them as they are not safe." Professional teeth whitening vs. at-home strips
"It’s like comparing a professional car wash to doing it yourself in the driveway," states Man. "Professional whitening uses stronger bleaching agents and gives you dramatic results in just one or two visits. Plus, if something goes wrong, your dentist is right there to fix it. They can also customize the treatment for your specific needs and address any sensitivity issues immediately. Strips are the DIY option that costs way less and lets you whiten while binge-watching Netflix. The downside? It takes longer to see results, and you might end up with some uneven spots if your teeth aren’t perfectly straight.”Sachar provides the following advantages and disadvantages for each type of treatment:Advantages of at-home whitening strips:•
More affordable than professional in-office treatments.•
Convenient and easier to use on your own schedule.•
Gradual whitening allows for subtle changes over time instead of quick one-day whitening.•
Reduced risk of sensitivity.Disadvantages of at-home whitening strips:•
Lower peroxide concentrations mean slower and less dramatic results.•
Strips may not fit perfectly, which can lead to uneven whitening, especially between the teeth or along the gumline.•
Greater chances of improper use resulting in adverse side effects, such as leaving them on too long.Advantages of professional teeth whitening:•
Fast and dramatic results in just one or two visits.•
Custom trays that fit the teeth exactly are sometimes included for continued home whitening or touch-ups.•
Protection for the gums to prevent sensitivity.•
Supervised by a professional, reducing the risk of misuse or complications.•
Professional in-office peroxide concentrations with enhanced activation using LED or laser light can produce a more dramatic and fast result.Disadvantages of professional teeth whitening:•
Significantly higher cost.•
May cause temporary tooth sensitivity in some patients.•
Less convenient, requiring scheduling and attending a dental visit. Can people with sensitive teeth use whitening strips?
"For patients that have more sensitive teeth, I advise them to use whitening strips with a lower peroxide concentration, or that contain desensitizing agents like potassium nitrate or fluoride," advises Sachar. "I recommend patients with sensitive teeth start using toothpaste for sensitive teeth, fluoride toothpaste or fluoride rinse, 1-2 weeks prior to whitening. I advise them also to space out the treatments with longer times between treatments. I advise them to avoid strips with harsh flavorings or containing unnecessary acids that can irritate the teeth and gums. Look for 'gentle' formulas like ‘Crest 3D White Gentle Routine.'"According to Man, you should take a break and call your dentist if "your teeth start feeling like they’re getting electric shocks." Teeth whitening strip tips from dentists
Start with a dental checkup: "I always recommend starting with a dental checkup before any whitening routine," recommends Man. "Your dentist can spot potential issues and help you choose the safest, most effective approach for your specific situation.“Follow directions closely: "Regardless of the product used, technique matters," says Sachar. "I advise patients to brush gently before applying the strips to make sure the teeth are plaque-free and avoid food and drinks that stain teeth for 24-48 hours after whitening. I recommend always following the instructions closely, including never exceeding the recommended frequency or duration."Wait to brush after whitening: "After whitening, always wait at least 30 minutes before brushing to allow enamel to re-harden and reduce the risk of abrasion or sensitivity," advises Sachar. "Brushing too soon can damage the temporarily softened enamel and irritate gums."Note that some discoloration may require in-office treatment: “While whitening strips can be effective for many people, professional whitening often provides more predictable and longer-lasting results," Man states. "Strips work great for everyday stains from food and drinks, but some types of discoloration from medications or other causes may need professional treatment."
Best teeth whitening strip FAQs
What are the most effective teeth whitening strips?
Crest 3D Whitestrips are widely considered the most effective teeth whitening strips due to their Advanced Seal Technology, which keeps them securely in place for better contact with teeth. They use a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide -- the same whitening agent used by dentists -- to remove both surface and deep stains while being enamel-safe.
Show more
Do dentists recommend whitening strips?
According to the American Dental Association, it is recommended to use only over-the-counter bleaching kits with the ADA Seal of Acceptance. These include Crest White Strips.
Show more
Should I brush before using teeth whitening strips?
You can brush before applying teeth whitening strips. Brushing and flossing before doing so will remove plaque and create a cleaner canvas. It's advised to wait 30 minutes after brushing to use whitening strips.

Are teeth whitening strips OK for your teeth?
If you have healthy teeth and good oral health, using a reputable teeth whitening strip should be fine when used as directed. Teeth whitening products are only meant to be used occasionally and in moderation, and it's always a better idea to speak with your dentist first about finding the best option for you. Additionally, steer clear of teeth whitening strips that contain chlorine dioxide.People who need dental work or have tooth pain should consult with their dentist to find out if teeth whitening is right for them.

Can whitening strips damage my enamel?
"When used properly, whitening strips do not damage or weaken tooth enamel," says Sachar. "However, excessive use or overlapping treatments without a proper break between them can contribute to temporary enamel dehydration and sensitivity ... Some non-ADA-approved ‘natural’ or ‘fast-acting’ whitening products can contain chlorine dioxide or sodium chlorite, which can thin enamel and increase the risk of tooth decay."

How long do whitening results last?
"Most people stay happy with their results for about six months to a year, but your habits make a huge difference," explains Man. "If you’re someone who can’t function without coffee or loves a good glass of red wine, your teeth will pick up new stains faster. Smokers see their results fade even quicker. The good news is that touch-up treatments work really well to keep your smile bright.”Sachar adds that proper oral hygiene habits can help you maintain the whitening results longer.

Are whitening strips safe for veneers?
"Strips won’t hurt your veneers, crowns or fillings, but here’s the catch: they won’t whiten them either," says Man. "Only your natural teeth will get lighter, which can leave you with a patchwork smile where some teeth are bright white and others haven’t budged. If you have a lot of dental work, definitely chat with your dentist before whitening so you don’t end up with mismatched teeth.”Sachar adds, "Repeated or prolonged exposure to peroxide may dull the luster of some composite or resin restorations over time."
