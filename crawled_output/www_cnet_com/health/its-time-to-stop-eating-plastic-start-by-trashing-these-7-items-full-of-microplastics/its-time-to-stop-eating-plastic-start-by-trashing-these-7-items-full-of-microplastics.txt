Yes, you're probably eating plastic for dinner. Here's how to stop that from happening. Svetlozar Hristov/Getty Images
Let's be honest, "microplastics" has been a buzzword we've all probably tried to ignore. But it's time for a reality check: You are eating and drinking tiny particles of plastic every single day. These invisible intruders have made their way into everything from our water to our food, and the science is starting to show that our casual exposure is a much bigger deal than we thought.And if you were hoping these plastic bits were just harmlessly passing through your system, think again. In fact, one February 2025 study revealed they're actually making themselves at home, building up in our bodies over time. That unsettling discovery has researchers scrambling to figure out what this means for our long-term health and whether there's a link to some serious diseases.CNET's Guide to Nontoxic Cookware
See at Cnet
So where is all this plastic coming from? A huge source is a place you'd least expect: your own kitchen. Between food wrap, containers, and even some cookware, the plastics add up. The good news is, you can lower your exposure with a few easy changes. Let's start by looking at where they're most likely hiding.Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Are microplastics harmful?Microplastics have become a serious problem for pollution, and now scientists worry about their potential health effects. An estimated 22 million micro and nanoplastics are inhaled by humans each year, and that is largely because they are so hard to avoid. You're exposed to microplastics in three ways: inhalation, ingestion or touch.Read more: My New Favorite Air Fryer Is Completely Nontoxic and Easy to CleanMicroplastics have been shown to cause a number of issues in the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics found in blood vessels have been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and, in severe cases, even death. Tissue inflammation, cell death and lung and liver impacts have all been noted. In animals and marine life, they can also cause oxidative and DNA damage, as well as cancer. Mice were shown to have reduced sperm count, ovarian scarring and hereditary metabolic disorders.Much is still unknown about the exact effects of microplastics, but studies so far have been sobering. They've inspired many home chefs to reconsider what they use in the kitchen and put in their bodies.
Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters. Nanoplastics are much smaller and invisible to the naked eye, ranging from 1 to 1,000 nanometers -- a fraction of the width of a human hair.
Svetlozar Hristov/Getty ImagesWhere microplastics hide in your kitchen
Microplastics are more common than you think. These are some places they may be hiding in your kitchen.1. Nonstick cookwareA new study found that plastic and nonstick cookware released microplastics into food during cooking, heightening one's exposure to these potentially harmful pollutants. Australian researchers estimate that Teflon-coated cookware contains thousands, maybe millions, of microplastic particles, while a simple crack or fracture in your pan could mean exposure to over two million microplastic particles.2. Plastic food containersYour Uber delivery could inadvertently be damaging your health, and it has nothing to do with what you order. With the rise of home delivery services, plastic containers are more common than ever, but these containers can easily add microplastics to your food when heated or washed. One study found that all reusable plastic takeout containers typically used by restaurants contain microplastics.3. Plastic utensils
Plastic utensils can leach microplastics into your food when exposed to high heat levels. Kinga Krzeminska/Getty ImagesStudies also show that plastic utensils release microplastics into your food, especially when used with hotter foods. When you ingest the food, you also ingest microplastics that settle into your body and bloodstream.4. Tea bagsIt may come as a surprise, but microplastics could be hiding in your tea bags. When you brew tea, the bag is exposed to extremely high temperatures that can release its microplastics. This comes from polypropylene, a key component in the manufacturing of tea bags. Researchers at Spain's Autonomous University of Barcelona found that billions of microplastic and nanoplastic particles are released from a single tea bag for every millimeter of water it is submerged in.
Research has shown that a single plastic tea bag can release billions of microplastic fragments. Zarina Lukash/Getty Images5. Certain spicesDepending on how it is packaged, that bottle of paprika could be full of microplastics. Many spices today use plastic packaging, which is concerning because one recent study found microplastics in all plastic containers tested. This can result in food contamination, which has increased in recent decades.6. Plastic strawsPlastic straws are especially concerning because studies show that they release microplastics and nanoplastics, which can then be directly inhaled. Unfortunately, plastic straws are extremely prevalent, with about eight million metric tons of plastic found in waterways each year. Once these straws and other plastics are in the water, they can affect not just the water but also the soil and animals found in it.7. Canned food liningsBPA was a controversial material used in the manufacturing of canned food linings that could cause serious health effects. Today, non-BPA acrylic or polyester epoxies are more commonly used, but these are not proven safe either, as they too contain microplastics.Kitchen material swaps to reduce microplasticsLuckily, you have alternatives. Before putting on your apron, consider adding these items to your kitchen to lower your risk of exposure to microplastics.Wooden or stainless spatulasThere are alternatives to plastic spatulas. Consider trying out a wooden utensil set or one made from stainless steel. This can significantly reduce your exposure to microplastics while upgrading your used utensils.Caraway Wooden Utensil Set
$125 at Caraway
Wooden or stainless steel utensilsInstead of plastic utensils, try to use stainless steel utensils that can be better for the body and also the environment. Wooden utensils can also be a great substitute, working as a more eco-friendly option for your kitchen.Glass or stainless steel food containersYou can't do much about how restaurants choose to package their food, but you can avoid using them in the future. At home, try to stick to glass, ceramic and stainless steel containers to skip the microplastics.Loose tea leaves and strainers or infusersArt of Tea English Breakfast Tea
$18 at Art of Tea
Tea bags can be filled with plastic, but a safer alternative could be loose tea leaves. Many companies nowadays offer loose tea leaves that can be used with a stainless steel strainer or infuser, which works the same as a tea bag but can be much healthier.Spices in bulk or glass containersTo avoid potential contamination from your spices, switch to glass or ceramic packaging instead. This allows your spices to remain on your shelf without being infused with potentially harmful microplastics that can seep into your food.Reusable metal or bamboo strawsPlastic straws take a toll on both the environment and your body, causing serious issues for both. A better alternative would be metal or bamboo straws that can be washed and reused. Even paper straws are a better alternative than plastic ones.
Reusable metal or bamboo straws are great alternatives to plastic ones.
Luliia Bondar/Getty ImagesFresh produce or frozen producePlastic linings in canned food can hold microplastics, so to eliminate your exposure, look for foods that are packaged in glass instead. You can also opt to use fresh and frozen foods and produce that skips the packaging altogether.Cast iron, carbon steel or stainless steel cookwarePlastic cookware is common in many kitchens, but there are alternatives. Products like stainless steel skillets, frying pans and cast iron pans can all be great ways to upgrade your cookware without risking further exposure to microplastics.The bottom lineMicroplastics can lurk in our kitchens, hiding in our cookware and utensils and making their way into our food. Though research continues, microplastics have been shown to cause damage to the human body, causing huge concerns over the products we use and the materials used to make them. However, hope is not lost. With a few simple changes, you can lessen your exposure to microplastics, thus better protecting your health. To learn more, here are the most common foods with microplastics and tips for reducing your intake.
