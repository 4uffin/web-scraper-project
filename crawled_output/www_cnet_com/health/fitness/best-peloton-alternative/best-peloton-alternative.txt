The Peloton bike is a popular exercise bike because of its advanced features, engaging instructors and fitness class varieties. I enjoy taking a class on a Peloton bike occasionally, and I understand the hype behind it. However, I’ve learned that not everyone wants a Peloton. Peloton alternatives are a good option if you want a similar experience to the Peloton, but you don't want the extras that come with it. I tested various exercise bikes over several months and determined which can serve as the best Peloton alternative in your home. Here are my top picks. Our Picks

What’s better, Echelon or Peloton?
What is the best Peloton alternative?The best overall Peloton alternative is the NordicTrack S24 Studio Bike. This bike offers a high-end experience similar to the Peloton with some extra features. Although it is a higher price (it costs more than a Peloton), it consists of a SmartAdjust feature miming real-world cycling. For example, if you’re virtually cycling through the woods of Colorado, the bike automatically adjusts to match that altitude and declines accordingly. The screen is also bigger on this bike (24 inches versus Peloton’s 21.5 inches).Similar to Peloton, NordicTrack also offers a membership subscription through the iFit app to access all of its classes, which you can sign up for separately. Another plus, you can connect third-party streaming services to this bike and watch your favorite TV shows or listen to your own music during a ride.Recent updatesEditor’s note, June 10, 2024: BowFlex filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2024, and the brand is now owned by Johnson Health Tech, which also owns Horizon Fitness and Matrix. You can still buy BowFlex products through its website and via retailers such as Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods.Editor's note, Jan. 1, 2025: We'll be updating this page periodically in the new year. There are currently new machines in the testing stages, as you'll see noted below. Some brands we're considering that weren't tested previously include Schwinn, Aviron, NordicTrack, Horizon and Zwift Ride. Editor's note, June 30, 2025: This whole page has been overhauled and updated with new products and testing. Best Peloton alternatives of 2025Filter by

NordicTrack S24 Studio bike
Best peloton alternative overall
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
It is quiet and smooth
It has the auto-adjust option when you’re taking a class to add a real-life feel to the workout
The touchscreen is bigger than Peloton’s at 24 inches
You can connect to popular third-party apps
Individual volume control for both instructor and music
Cons
The handles have plastic buttons for resistance and incline. The buttons make the product look cheap and make me wonder if it’ll break easily.
iFIT Pro membership costs more at $396 yearly and controls the ability to access more advanced classes and features
Can’t connect to the Peloton app
S24 exercise bike costs more than a Peloton at $2,399
Why we like it: You can have assembly included for this bike, which we found helpful. One of NordicTrack’s unique qualities is its SmartAdjust feature, which allows the bike to adjust resistance based on your fitness level. I tested this while cycling through a scenic mountainside, and the bike automatically adjusted the incline based on elevation. This is the same feature on NordicTrack treadmills.The best way to experience the NordicTrack S24 bike is by taking cycling classes through its iFIT Train app ($15 monthly or $144 yearly). Like Peloton, you can also take fitness classes like yoga and strength training. This bike also comes with 3-pound dumbbells with a rack holder beneath the screen.The base of the screen has a built-in fan, which is nice when you’ve been sweating through a session. This screen is bigger than Peloton’s and swivels if you plan on doing floor exercises. I could comfortably ride with standard sneakers in the pedal cages, but the pedals are double-sided for clip-in shoes.Who is it best for: This bike is for you if you like the feel of the Peloton but are looking for an alternative with a more immersive experience. You can pay extra for the iFIT Pro membership ($39 monthly or $396 yearly), which is best if multiple people plan on using the bike or if you want custom workout creations. You can still access third-party apps like Netflix, Prime, Spotify, Strava, Garmin Connect and Google Fit. It’s nice having the option to listen to your music or stream your favorite shows.One of the features I like that NordicTrack applies to its machines is the individualized volume control, so you can lower the instructor’s volume during a class or increase the music volume or vice versa. Another plus is that you can connect your Bluetooth-powered headphones, so your workout won’t disrupt anyone in your house.Who should not get it: This bike is one of the most expensive on the list and costs more than a Peloton. I wasn’t a fan of the buttons that control the resistance because they’re made of what looks like cheap plastic. I would’ve preferred a resistance knob. If it’s not within your budget, there are cheaper Peloton alternatives. You also can’t access the Peloton app on this bike, even with the various third-party app access. On the other hand, if this bike is within your budget, you may want to purchase the Peloton instead. Even with classes, the iFIT instructors don’t match the Peloton instructors’ energy.  ... Show more

BowFlex IC Bike SE
Best budget Peloton alternative
7.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Affordable at $600
Can connect to third-party apps like Peloton
Solid bike with a smooth ride and doesn’t shake when in use
JRNY app is inexpensive at $149 yearly and allows up to three profiles
JRNY monthly All-Access membership is $24 cheaper than Peloton All-Access membership
The warranty lasts up to 10 years for the frame
Cons
Flywheel location in the back makes it harder to move the bike
No touchscreen; you’ll need a tablet to use it
No third-party music option
Assembly requires an extra person
Why we like it: If you want a more cost-effective Peloton alternative, consider the BowFlex IC Bike SE. This exercise bike costs less than half the price of a Peloton ($600), and you get similar perks. Assembly can take over 1.5 hours, but it’s doable if you have an extra person to help and follow the tutorials. If it’s within your budget, you can also pay extra for BowFlex to provide in-house assembly (prices vary by location). This exercise bike has 100 resistance levels, is quiet and is smooth overall. Its 7-inch LCD screen is tiny compared to the Peloton’s but provides data like resistance, speed, watts and burn rate. The upside is that you can use a tablet with this exercise bike and easily connect to the Peloton app and other third-party apps like Explore the World and Zwift. You also have free access to JRNY, BowFlex’s fitness app, for the first two months if you’re a new member. Afterward, you can pick from the mobile-only membership ($11.99 monthly or $100 yearly) or the All-Access membership ($19.99 monthly or $149 yearly). The bike also comes with 3-pound dumbbells, which can be used for floor exercise during other classes. The pedals are dual-sided cages, so you can ride with standard or clip-in shoes. Who is it best for: If you want an affordable Peloton alternative and are OK with the lack of a touchscreen, the BowFlex is a good choice. At $600, the bike is a steal, and even the JRNY All-Access membership at $29 a month is cheaper than Peloton’s equivalent at $44 a month. This bike also has the best warranty on the frame, covering up to 10 years and 2 years on mechanical parts. Overall, I like BowFlex as a brand, and its quality stands up to the IC Bike SE.Who should not get it: The flywheel on this bike is located in the back, so it may be a challenge to move it around compared to bikes with the flywheel in the front. This is something to consider if you live alone or plan on moving the bike often. Also, if the seat doesn’t feel comfortable after a few rides, you’ll probably end up shelling out money for a better seat replacement. The BowFlex extra comfort bike seat is an additional $40. The music selection wasn’t my favorite because you can only pick from the JRNY Radio. I like having the option to play my own music from Spotify or Apple Music. If this matters to you, you're better off with another Peloton alternative -- even if you have to spend a little more.  ...

Echelon Connect EX-5S-22
Best easy-to-use Peloton alternative
7.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Easy to use
The screen is bigger than Peloton’s at 22 inches
Quiet when in use
Echelon Premier membership is cheaper than Peloton’s at $40 monthly
Can connect to third-party apps like Strava and Spotify
Cons
Issues connecting to the Bluetooth initially
Can’t connect to the Peloton app
Classes may be less engaging than Peloton’s
Warranty is only for 1 year
Why we like it: The Echelon EX-5S-22 is the best Peloton alternative if you want an exercise bike that is intuitive to use and provides a similar look and experience. Assembly is similar to BowFlex and can be done at home by following an instructional video. Or you can pay extra for in-home assembly (prices vary by location). It’s a slightly higher price than our budget pick, but it may satisfy that Peloton itch.I’ve tested other Echelon exercise equipment before, and I appreciate the simplistic design from the assembly to the software. You don’t always have the time to learn a new piece of fitness equipment and want to take it for a spin right away. At $1,000, it’s also a more affordable bike than a Peloton and includes a slightly larger 22-inch touchscreen. You have access to the Echelon Fit app, which gives you access to live and on-demand classes. The screen is large enough to get a clear view of the class's instructor and all your stats during a ride. The pedals are also dual-sided, so you can choose regular sneakers or clip-on shoes. Overall, it’s similar to riding a Peloton, minus the cost.Who is it best for: This bike is best for the rider who wants a bike that is easy to use and doesn’t require much of a learning curve. This is also appropriate for the exerciser who doesn’t want to fully commit to the Peloton but still likes indoor cycling classes. An Echelon Premier membership is cheaper than Peloton’s All-Access membership ($44/month). You can pick from two membership options: Premier (create up to five profiles with unlimited classes for $40/month and cancel anytime; or pay annually at $33/month or $400 a year) and FitPass (one profile with limited classes, $11.99/month). You can also connect with third-party apps like Strava, Apple Health and Fitbit, and listen to your music or audiobooks via Spotify, Apple Music or Audible. Who should not get it: One of the issues I had when setting up this bike was connecting to the Bluetooth. It took some troubleshooting. If you’d like the option to connect to the Peloton app, this bike doesn’t allow it. One of the things Peloton has over Echelon is the instructors. If you love Peloton’s instructors' energy, you may find Echelon’s instructors less exciting and motivating. The screen also doesn’t tilt like Peloton’s while doing floor exercises. The warranty is also only for a year.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing a Peloton alternative
Although the Peloton is the most popular exercise bike, it may not be what everyone is looking for. There may be better options to fit your needs. We rounded up this list with alternatives that can be better options if you don’t want to commit to a Peloton.AssemblyThe perks of owning a Peloton are that assembly is included with your delivery. If you decide to buy a Peloton alternative, be prepared to assemble it on your own. We looked at the options the exercise bike brand offered or included assembly. For those bikes we had to assemble, we considered how clear the instructions were and how long it took to build the bike.FeaturesSimilar to the Peloton, these alternatives include a subscription to access their classes. We looked at whether the member subscription is essential to your indoor cycling experience or if there’s an option to just ride or connect to other third-party apps. We also looked at how the bike’s features compare to a Peloton.FunctionalityDuring the testing experience, we examined how well the exercise bike functioned compared to a Peloton. We considered whether any pieces arrived broken or if parts of the bike didn’t function correctly. We also observed how intuitive it is to use as a first-time rider since a Peloton is relatively easy to use.WarrantyWhen making a big purchase like a Peloton alternative, it’s essential to know the warranty in case anything breaks. We looked at the warranty's length and what parts of the exercise bike it covers. How we test Peloton alternatives
Testing a Peloton alternative means it needs to meet a few basic benchmarks to see how it measures up against the Peloton. While testing these bikes, we took into consideration assembly, the types of classes offered and the features while comparing it to the true Peloton experience. We looked at the following:Size, stability and comfort: This includes ease of assembly (if needed), the size of the bike, how much noise it makes, whether it wobbles and how comfortable it is to sit and ride. Software features: As a Peloton alternative, it must provide a similar experience to the Peloton bike. This includes heart-rate monitoring, a wide variety of workout types through its workout subscription, plus an app and/or a built-in screen to access these workouts.Ease of use: Peloton alternatives should be easy enough for a beginner or advanced rider to use. If they’re too complicated, they can’t be Peloton alternatives. Other Peloton alternatives tested
Schwinn IC 4:The Schwinn IC 4 left much to be desired because the console arrived broken and wouldn’t turn on. This is a traditional exercise bike that I have used in the past and like overall. But I wouldn’t label it as a “best Peloton alternative.” It doesn’t have a touchscreen, so you’ll need a tablet to use it and follow along with your favorite third-party workout apps.

$799 at Amazon ZWIFT Ride with KICKR CoreI didn’t think the ZWIFT Ride with KICKR Core was appropriate for a Peloton alternatives list since it’s unique enough to be in its own category and was designed for serious cyclists who want an indoor trainer experience. The bike’s frame is a smart bike that connects to Wahoo’s KICKR Core, which automatically controls the resistance on the bike. Since this bike doesn't have a touchscreen, you will need a tablet or smartphone to use the ZWIFT companion app. The ZWIFT workout imagery design resembles a cross between the Sims and Mario Kart video games without the special effects. If you plan on using a different cog other than the KICKR core, you have to make sure it is ZWIFT compatible first. This is a better option as an exercise bike instead of a Peloton alternative.

See at Zwift Horizon 7.0 IC Indoor CycleThe Horizon 7.0 IC Indoor Cycle was a straightforward exercise bike overall, but I wouldn’t consider it the best option for a Peloton alternative. It didn’t come with broken parts and was on the easier side to assemble, so I would recommend this to someone who wants a simple and reliable bike. It does connect to the Peloton app and others, but lacks a touchscreen and high-tech features. A plus is that this exercise bike has a lifetime warranty. Horizon 7.0 IC Indoor Cycle

Workouts you can do with Peloton alternatives
Peloton is considered the best of the best when it comes to exercise bikes. Other exercise bikes allow you to do the same workouts with some differences. For example, there may be bikes that have their own version of a touchscreen and cycling classes. Most workouts you do on a Peloton can also be done on a Peloton alternative. Some exercises you may want to try include:High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): If you're used to riding an exercise bike, you're familiar with HIIT rides. You use short bursts of energy followed by a rest period, and you can play around with the resistance to make the ride harder or easier. Additionally, it's a good way to get a quick workout in less than 30 minutes.Hills and sprinting: If you're focusing on improving your stamina and endurance, practicing cycling uphill with heavy resistance and sprinting on little to no resistance on an exercise bike is a good way to do so. You should also have the option to “Just Ride,” similar to Peloton, which doesn’t require connecting to a class. Other group fitness classes: One of the perks of being a Peloton member is that you have access to workout classes other than cycling. You should be able to take similar classes with a Peloton alternative. Best practices for Peloton alternatives
Adjust the bike to your needs: Before using a Peloton alternative, you’ll need to adjust the seat and handlebars. This will vary per person, but ideally, you want the seat to be hip height.Wear the right shoes: Peloton alternatives may allow you to use clip-in shoes (just like Peloton), while others only have cages that can fit any sneaker. If you’ve never used clip-in shoes, you should practice getting on and off the bike with them first, since they require a bit of a learning curve.Know your bike: It helps to learn where the resistance is on your Peloton alternative. For example, on most bikes, you turn a knob to increase or decrease resistance. If there is a touchscreen, it's helpful to know how to access the classes you’ll want to participate in, how to adjust settings like volume and how to set up user profiles and other features on your device. Finally, you’ll want to know how to stop the bike in case of an emergency. Peloton alternatives FAQ
Which bike is Peloton's biggest competitor?
This is a tough question to answer because it depends on what kind of exercise bikes you’re into. But based on the popular exercise bikes and the bikes that resemble Peloton the most during testing, it would have to be NordicTrack, BowFlex and Echelon.

What should I look for when buying an indoor exercise bike?
You’ll want to consider cost, size, display screen and whether you want to pay for a monthly subscription. If your main goal is to simulate the experience of riding a Peloton, you’ll want to get a bike that offers similarities, like the NordicTrack S24.

Which muscles does indoor cycling work?
Indoor cycling is a full-body workout. It targets your core, upper body, back, glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings and lower legs. Some bikes also include weights so you can more specifically target muscle groups in your arms.

Is a built-in or BYO screen better?
The most eye-catching aspect of the Peloton exercise bike is its 21.5-inch HD touchscreen. For a Peloton alternative, you want the exercise bike to have a screen or tablet compatibility. Some exercise bikes like NordicTrack and Echelon come with the large touchscreens, but other brands like BowFlex require you to use a tablet to access classes. The smaller screen may not draw you in as much, but it’s a personal preference whether you want the touchscreen.

Is a subscription necessary?
Peloton charges $44 a month for its All-Access membership. As you can tell by the Peloton alternatives list, other brands offer similar memberships through their app subscriptions. You can use any of these bikes independently, but if you want to get the most out of a bike, you may want to consider signing up for a membership as well. The other plus is most of these exercise bikes connect to third-party apps, so there are different ways to use them.

What’s better, Echelon or Peloton?
This depends on the type of experience you’re looking for. An Echelon is a slightly more affordable option ($300 cheaper), and it’s easy to follow like a Peloton. But a Peloton has a rotating screen, and its instructors tend to be more high-energy than Echelon’s. If the classes matter the most to you, an Echelon membership is slightly cheaper than Peloton’s, so you may want to spend the extra money on the classes and bike if it’s in your budget.
