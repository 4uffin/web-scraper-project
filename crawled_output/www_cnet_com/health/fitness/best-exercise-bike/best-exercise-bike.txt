Smart exercise bikes are sought after since the Peloton bike rose to popularity. Similar to Peloton, most of these exercise bikes have advanced features, engaging instructors and fitness class varieties that can all be enjoyed in the comfort of your home. While some people are devoted to the Peloton bike, I’ve learned that not everyone necessarily wants one. As CNET’s resident fitness expert, my role is to offer honest, informative and helpful fitness and wellness advice, which is why I tested 10 exercise bikes over five months to find the ones that can serve as the very best for you. They vary in price and features, so you’re bound to find one that fits your needs.  Our Picks

What is the best exercise bike overall?The best exercise bike overall is the Peloton Bike. The Peloton offers top-of-the-line workout classes that you can do on the bike and the floor. The instructors are motivating, energetic and likable, which can be encouraging even if you don’t want to do a workout. The Peloton bike isn’t the cheapest on the list, but compared to some of its more expensive competitors, it is fairly priced at $1,145. You also have the option to try it out at home for 30 days before officially committing to it. Another plus is that Peloton is all about catering to its users, including delivery and assembly with your order. I’ve had Peloton deliver a couple of pieces of equipment to my home and they have always been fast and efficient. Recent updatesMay 10, 2025: This whole page has been overhauled, re-tested and updated with new exercise bikes.Best exercise bikes of 2025

Best overall exercise bike
8.8

SCORE
Pros
Engaging live and on-demand classes
Connects to multiple third-party apps
You can play your own music during “Just Workout” or “Scenic” classes
All-Access Peloton membership gives you unlimited profiles
Cons
21.5-inch screen is smaller than other exercise bike options
You can’t livestream any shows through Hulu or Netflix
Screen doesn’t rotate for floor exercises
Why we like it: The Peloton bike is well-known as the “It” bike for good reason. Delivery is easy and straightforward, with assembly included. The live and on-demand cycling classes found through the Peloton app or All-Access membership are taught by high-energy and motivating instructors. The screen isn’t the biggest on the list (21.5 inches), but it is big enough to get a good display of the class in action. Because classes are the big appeal of Peloton, it’s easy to follow along on the screen as instructors tell you to keep track of your output, cadence and resistance. Besides cycling, you can also take yoga, bootcamp, strength training, meditation classes and more. If you’re into tracking your data, you can connect to some third-party apps like Apple Health, Garmin and Strava, and play your own music via Apple Music or Spotify.If you’d like to step it up a notch and don’t mind spending an extra $855, you can also upgrade to the Peloton Bike Plus, which has a bigger, rotating screen (23.8 inches) and automatically adjusts resistance.  Who it’s best for: The Peloton bike is best for the rider who loves motivating cycling classes. Peloton is well-known for its high-energy instructors and they’re what keep the brand thriving. If you know you like the motivational boost from boutique fitness classes, then the Peloton bike is your best choice. It’s also the best pick for you if multiple people in your household plan on using the bike because you get unlimited profiles with an All-Access membership.Who should not get it: Peloton has third-party app options, but it doesn’t allow you to livestream your favorite shows on Hulu or Netflix. If this option is important to you, you will feel like this exercise bike is incomplete. The screen also doesn’t rotate, which you should consider if you're planning on looking at the screen as you do a non-cycling workout. Some people may find the All-Access membership to be on the pricier side at $44 a month and would prefer a cheaper program. They can also downgrade to the Peloton One membership, which is more affordable ($19/month), but keeps you from having the full Peloton experience.   ... Show more

NordicTrack S24 Studio bike
Best Peloton alternative exercise bike
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
It is quiet and smooth
It has the auto-adjust option when you’re taking a class to add a real-life feel to the workout
The touchscreen is bigger than Peloton’s at 24 inches
You can connect to popular third-party apps
Individual volume control for instructor and music
iFIT Pro membership costs $132/year less than Peloton All-Access membership
Cons
The handles have plastic buttons for resistance and incline. The buttons make the product look cheap and make me wonder if it’ll break easily.
iFIT Pro membership costs more at $396 yearly and controls the ability to access more advanced classes and features
Can’t connect to the Peloton app
S24 exercise bike costs more than a Peloton at $2,499
Why we like it: I found NordicTrack’s S24 Studio bike to be similar to Peloton with some differences. You can have assembly included for this bike, which we found helpful. One of NordicTrack’s unique qualities is its SmartAdjust feature, which allows the bike to adjust resistance based on your fitness level. I tested this out while cycling through a scenic mountainside, and the bike automatically adjusted the incline based on elevation. This is the same feature on NordicTrack treadmills.The best way to experience the NordicTrack S24 bike is by taking cycling classes through its iFIT Train app ($15 monthly or $144 yearly). Like Peloton, you can also take fitness classes like yoga and strength training. This bike also comes with 3-pound dumbbells with a rack holder beneath the screen.The base of the screen has a built-in fan, which is nice when you’ve been sweating through a session. This screen is bigger than Peloton’s at 24 inches and swivels if you plan on doing floor exercises. I could comfortably ride with standard sneakers in the pedal cages, but they are double-sided for clip-in shoes.Who it’s best for: This bike is for you if you like the feel of the Peloton but are looking for an alternative with a more immersive experience. You can pay extra for the iFIT Pro membership ($39 monthly or $396 yearly), which is best if multiple people plan on using the bike or if you want custom workout creations. You can still access third-party apps like Garmin Connect, Google Fit, Netflix, Prime, Spotify and Strava. It’s nice having the option to listen to your music or stream your favorite shows.One of the features I like that NordicTrack applies to its machines is the individualized volume control, so you can lower the instructor’s volume during a class or increase the music volume or vice versa. Another plus is you can connect your Bluetooth-powered headphones so your workout won’t disrupt anyone in your house.Who should not get it: This bike is one of the most expensive on the list and costs more than a Peloton. I wasn’t a fan of the buttons that control the resistance because they’re made up of what looks like cheap plastic. In this case, I would’ve preferred a resistance knob. If it’s not within your budget, there are cheaper exercise bike options. If you're really into the idea of having a Peloton alternative, keep in mind you can’t access the Peloton app on this bike, even with the various third-party app access. On the other hand, if this bike is within your budget, you may want to purchase the Peloton instead. Even with classes, the iFIT instructors don’t match Peloton instructors’ energy.  ... Show more

Aviron Fit Bike
Best exercise bike for gamers
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
More than a gaming bike with access to your own music and favorite apps
Big touchscreen at 22-inches and rotates
Access to various livestreaming and third-party apps: Hulu, Max, Netflix, Strava, etc.
Tons of game options to choose from
Generous 10-year bike frame warranty and 1-year limited warranty on equipment and accessories
Can connect to heart rate monitors/wearables
Cons
Not ideal for all heights; best for taller riders
Resistance is controlled by buttons on the screen instead of a knob
Expensive at $2,000
Why we like it: I’ve tested Aviron exercise equipment previously when I tested rowing machines so I had an idea of what to expect with its exercise bike. The Aviron Fit Bike is set up as a gamer experience. Although it’s known as a gaming bike, I found this bike to have the most variety. It has a large 22-inch rotating screen and you can livestream from your favorite apps like Hulu, Max or Netflix and track your fitness data through Apple Health or Strava. There are classes, games, live group workouts, scenic rides and friendly competitions with friends or other riders. Although the Aviron Fit Bike comes with pedal cages, it includes a clip-on option in case you prefer clip-on shoes. You can also play your own music through Apple Music or Spotify and control the volume of the music, effects and voices during games. You won’t get bored using this bike because there is so much you can do with it. Aviron is generous and has a 10-year warranty on the bike frame and a 1-year limited warranty on equipment and accessories. If you want a lifetime warranty then you have the option to pay $9 extra a month.Who it’s best for: If you're big into gaming and that’s what keeps you motivated to work out, then this is the perfect exercise bike for you. You can interact with other riders, connect with friends who have the same bike and stream your favorite shows or apps. Some of the games remind me of popular video games of the ‘90s where you have to capture a certain number of items to earn points while cycling. Similar to other exercise bikes, you have an Aviron membership that you can sign up for annually ($24/month for 12 months) or monthly ($29/month). Initially, you get one free month so you can experience unlimited profiles before making your membership decision. This membership allows you to have extra access to beginner's guided workouts, live competitions and unlimited profiles. I think these unique features make the bike appealing because you forget you’re working out when your mind is focused on completing these challenges. Who should not get it: If you’re short like I am -- 5 feet -- this may not be the most comfortable option for you. Even at the lowest seat setting, I felt like I struggled to get up on the bike compared to the others. I’d recommend this bike to someone taller or with longer limbs. This checks out as I found the Aviron rowing machine to also be most appropriate for someone taller. I personally prefer that exercise bikes use a knob to control the resistance but this bike uses buttons found on the bottom of the screen. This makes me question the durability of this design and how it would be replaced if it were to break.   ... Show more

BowFlex IC Bike SE
Best budget exercise bike
7.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Affordable at $600
Can connect to third-party apps like Peloton
Solid bike with a smooth ride and doesn’t shake when in use
JRNY app is inexpensive at $149 yearly and allows up to three profiles
JRNY monthly All-Access membership is affordable at $29/month
The warranty lasts up to 10 years for the frame
Cons
Flywheel location in the back makes it harder to move the bike
No touchscreen; you’ll need a tablet to use it
No third-party music option
Assembly requires an extra person
Why we like it: If you want a more cost-effective exercise bike, consider the BowFlex IC Bike SE. At $600, this bike costs almost less than half the price of a Peloton, is significantly cheaper than the NordicTrack option and you get similar perks. Assembly can take more than 90 minutes but it’s doable if you have an extra person to help and follow the tutorials. If it’s within your budget, you can also pay extra for BowFlex to provide in-house assembly (prices vary by location). This exercise bike has 100 resistance levels, is quiet and is smooth overall. Its 7-inch LCD screen is tiny compared to the Peloton’s but provides data -- resistance, speed, watts and burn rate. The upside is that you can use a tablet with this exercise bike and easily connect to the Peloton app and other third-party apps like Explore the World and Zwift. You also have free access to JRNY, BowFlex’s fitness app, for the first two months if you’re a new member. Afterward, you can pick from the mobile-only membership ($11.99 monthly or $100 yearly) or All-Access membership ($19.99 monthly or $149 yearly). The bike also comes with 3-pound dumbbells, which can be used for floor exercise during other classes. The pedals are dual-sided cages, so you can ride with standard or clip-in shoes. Who it’s best for: If you want an affordable exercise bike and are OK with the lack of a touchscreen, the BowFlex is a good choice. At $600, the bike is a steal and even the JRNY All-Access membership at $29 a month is cheaper than some other options on this list. This bike also has the best warranty on the frame, covering up to 10 years and 2 years on mechanical parts. Overall, I like BowFlex as a brand and its quality stands up with the IC Bike SE.Who should not get it: The flywheel on this bike is located in the back so it may be a challenge to move it around compared to some of the other bikes with the flywheel in the front. This is something to consider if you live alone or plan on moving the bike often. Also, if the seat doesn’t feel comfortable after a few rides, you’ll probably end up shelling out money for a better seat replacement. The BowFlex extra comfort bike seat is an additional $40. The music selection wasn’t my favorite because you can only pick from the JRNY Radio. I like having the option to play my own music from Apple Music or Spotify. If this matters to you, you're better off with another exercise bike -- even if you have to spend a little more.  ...

7.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Easy to use
The screen is big at 22 inches
Quiet when in use
Echelon Premier membership is affordable at $40/month or $400/year
Can connect to third-party apps like Spotify and Strava
Cons
Issues connecting to the Bluetooth initially
Classes may be less engaging than Peloton’s
Warranty is only for 1 year
Why we like it: The Echelon EX-5S-22 is the best exercise bike for beginners because it’s intuitive to use. Assembly is similar to BowFlex and can be done at home by following an instructional video. Or you can pay extra for in-home assembly (prices vary by location). It’s a slightly higher price than our budget pick, but is still a good option.I’ve tested other Echelon exercise equipment before and I appreciate the simplistic design from the assembly to the software. You don’t always have the time to learn a new piece of fitness equipment and want to take it for a spin right away. At $1,000, it’s also a more affordable exercise bike than some others on this list.You have access to the Echelon Fit app, which gives you access to live and on-demand classes. The 22-inch screen is large enough to get a clear view of the class's instructor and all your stats during a ride. The pedals are also dual-sided, so you can choose regular sneakers or clip-on shoes. Overall, it’s similar to riding one of the more expensive exercise bike picks, minus the cost.Who it’s best for: This bike is best for the rider who wants a bike that is easy to use and doesn’t require much of a learning curve. This is appropriate for a first-time cyclist who doesn’t want a complicated machine, but still likes access to indoor cycling classes. An Echelon Premier membership is cheaper than Peloton’s All-Access membership, for example. You can pick from two membership options: Premier (create up to five profiles with unlimited classes for $40/month and cancel anytime; or pay annually at $33/month or $400 a year) and FitPass (one profile with limited classes, $11.99/month). You can also connect with third-party apps like Apple Health, Fitbit and Strava, and listen to your music or audiobooks via Apple Music, Audible or Spotify, Who should not get it: One of the issues I had when setting up this bike was connecting to the Bluetooth. It took some troubleshooting to get it connected. If you're really into cycling classes and have experienced the appeal of a Peloton instructor, you may find Echelon’s instructors less exciting and motivating. The warranty for this bike is also only for a year.  ... Show more

Speediance VeloNix bike
Best AI-powered exercise bike
6.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lack of a flywheel makes it safe to have around kids and pets
You can connect to third-party apps and play your own music
Large rotating 21.5-inch screen
Cons
Arrived with a broken handle
Had to troubleshoot and had some connection issues
May need to upgrade to Pro membership at $14.99 a month
No option for in-home assembly
Warranty is only for two years
Why we like it: One of the first things I liked about the Speediance VeloNix bike was its futuristic, sleek look. This bike doesn’t have a flywheel like the other bikes because it uses a flywheel-free motor so it’s extra quiet. The VeloNix uses a 2300W electric powertrain, which offers precise resistance when you ride. Using AI, you can get all your data insights and real-time speed, power and cadence tracking during a class or when you’re doing a free ride. This exercise bike has a large 21.5-inch rotating touchscreen and offers on-demand classes. Although it doesn’t have live classes, you can compete with other riders on a live leaderboard. I also found the seat to be the most comfortable on this bike compared to the rest I tested. Another plus: You can connect to third-party apps like Disney, Hulu, Max and Netflix, and Garmin, Spotify and Strava.Who it’s best for: This bike is best for riders who are into the latest AI technology and don’t like traditional exercise bikes. The lack of a flywheel might even make it safer if you have small children or pets. I would recommend paying extra for a subscription to access the extra workouts ($49/month) because you can tell that you’ll go through the free ones quickly. The resistance on this bike was also surprisingly more challenging than I expected as I gradually increased it. It felt like I had to make more effort to push through than the other bikes. This may be something you like if you push yourself during a workout.Who should not get it: One of the downsides to the VeloNix is that you have to assemble it yourself as there is no option for in-home assembly. Some parts of the handles are made of plastic and one broke in transit. However, I was sent a replacement piece. For a bike that costs $2,700, I would expect all the pieces to be made of durable material that can’t easily break so I question the production quality. I had to troubleshoot the software connection because I was having issues with Bluetooth and setting up the language but I eventually figured it out. VeloNix has just two membership tiers: a free Standard membership and the Pro membership, which costs $14.99 a month. The main difference is that Standard members get 20% off indoor classes, scenic rides and track training, while Pro members get full access to all of the content, including full access to VeloNix’s track programs. The price isn’t the worst but the bike almost gives you no choice but to upgrade so that you can take full advantage of the workouts. The warranty could also be better and only lasts two years.  ...

CAROL bike
Best exercise bike with science-based workouts
6.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Get a good workout done in as little as five minutes
Connects to Peloton and other third-party apps
Workout programs are foolproof to follow
Can pay extra to extend the 1-year component warranty
Cons
Expensive at $2,595 for a bike without a screen or various workout classes
You need a tablet to access workouts
Classes are not in the traditional cycling format
In-home assembly is pricey at $300
Why we like it: The CAROL bike quickly became one of my favorite exercise bikes. You can assemble it yourself or pay an additional $300 to have it professionally done. You can test it at home for 100 days before fully committing to it. CAROL (an acronym for Cardiovascular Optimization Logic, the method used to optimize and personalize cardio workouts) uses AI-powered REHIT (reduced exertion HIIT) workouts that are intended to be short and effective. REHIT focuses on exercises with just 2×20-second sprints. According to CAROL, these exercises are science-based and developed to give you a better workout in less time (as little as five minutes). CAROL uses adaptive AI technology that pushes you to your max based on your fitness level. As a mom who likes to work out but has limited time, I appreciated that I felt I got an efficient workout each time I used the CAROL bike. The different workout selections (REHIT, Fat Burn, Free and Custom and Fitness tests) were easy to follow and took out the guesswork with its built-in timer. Although this bike doesn’t have a built-in touchscreen, you can connect it to your tablet and download the CAROL app, which is easy to navigate. Another plus, you can connect to the Peloton app, Netflix, YouTube, Zwift and other third-party apps. Who it’s best for: This exercise bike is best for anyone who doesn’t have the time for an hour-long workout. You can easily get a good workout using the CAROL bike in just 5 minutes, and it’s easy to follow. If you already have a Peloton, Netflix, YouTube or Zwift membership, you can connect it to this bike. If you like the CAROL bike fitness programs, you can sign up for the membership ($19.99 monthly). The warranty isn’t bad on this bike either and has the frame covered for five years, and the option to extend component coverage for an additional $150.Who should not get it: If you think this bike is going to offer cycling classes in the traditional sense, you’ll be let down. The app only displays your power, cadence and heart rate, so it’s nothing exciting to look at when it’s in use and doesn’t resemble a fitness class. It’s also a hefty price for an exercise bike that costs more than a Peloton and NordicTrack bike at $2,595 and lacks group fitness classes and its own screen.  ... Show more

What to consider when choosing an exercise bike
Although there are plenty of exercise bikes, it’s important to consider the different brands and types out there to fit your needs. We rounded up this list with all kinds of riders in mind and alternatives that can be options if you don’t want to buy a Peloton. We test all of our exercise bikes using the same criteria.Assembly and deliveryAlthough some exercise bikes include assembly with delivery, not all do. With some bikes, you may have to pay extra for that service or you’ll have to be comfortable assembling it on your own. We considered whether an exercise bike brand included or offered assembly (and how much it costs), and for those bikes we had to assemble, we considered how clear the instructions are and how long it took to build the bike.FeaturesWe also looked at what makes the bike unique, whether it’s a special function or any other bells and whistles. This included its functions, class types, programming, bike software, third-party app connections and the ability to connect to wearables like heart rate monitors.  MembershipMany smart bikes now include a subscription to access their classes. We looked at whether the member subscription is essential to your indoor cycling experience or if there’s an option to just ride or connect to other third-party apps. For example, some subscription services offer less expensive options to add family members. Functionality During the testing experience, we looked at how well the exercise bike functioned. We considered if any pieces arrived broken or if parts of the bike didn’t function correctly. We also observed how quiet the bike is and how intuitive it is to use as a first-time rider. If there is a learning curve, we took into account how quickly it is to learn, but also understand that this may be different for everyone.Software ease of useMost exercise bikes have an app and/or a screen that has a required software. We took into account how well-developed the software is, if it’s intuitive to use and how technologically advanced it is. WarrantyWhen making a big purchase like an exercise bike, it’s essential to know the warranty in case anything breaks. We considered how long the warranty is, what parts of the exercise bike it covers and if there is an extended warranty option. How we test exercise bikes
We tested these bikes over five months, taking into account assembly, the types of classes offered and features. When testing, we looked at the following:Size, stability and comfort: This includes ease of assembly, the size of the bike, how much noise it makes, whether it wobbles and how comfortable the seat and pedals are while riding.Software features: Exercise bikes typically include software. This includes heart-rate monitoring and reporting, access to a wide variety of workout types, plus an app and/or a built-in screen to access these workouts. Cycling flexibility: It's important that the indoor bikes be versatile enough for a beginner or advanced rider to use. If it seems too niche and not applicable to everyone, then it takes away the enjoyment some riders will get. Other exercise bikes tested
Schwinn IC 4: The Schwinn IC 4 is the classic exercise bike used in traditional indoor cycling classes. This isn’t a smart bike, so it may leave much to be desired if you’re looking for fancy features. It doesn’t have a touchscreen, so you’ll need a tablet to use it and follow along with your favorite third-party workout apps. But if you want an exercise bike that is sturdy, reliable and gives you a good workout, you can't go wrong with it. Another plus, it comes with 5-pound dumbbells, so you can include some upper-body workouts during your cycling sessions. You'll also have access to the JRNY All-Access Membership for free for two months. If you'd like to experience Peloton, you can still download the app and experience it with this exercise bike.Horizon 7.0 IC Indoor Cycle: The Horizon 7.0 IC Indoor Cycle was a straightforward exercise bike overall but compared to others on this list, the features aren’t as outstanding. It was on the easier side to assemble so I would recommend this to someone who wants a simple and reliable bike. It does connect to the Peloton app and others but lacks a touchscreen and high-tech features. A plus is that this exercise bike has a lifetime warranty. ZWIFT Ride with KICKR Core: The ZWIFT Ride with KICKR Core was more involved than I would’ve liked, set up-wise and even learning the software, but it is unique enough to be in its own category. This bike is best for serious cyclists who want an indoor trainer experience. The bike’s frame is a smart bike that connects to Wahoo’s KICKR Core, which automatically controls the resistance on the bike. You will need a tablet or smartphone to use the ZWIFT companion app because this bike doesn’t have a touchscreen. The ZWIFT workout imagery design resembles a cross between the Sims and Mario Kart video games without the special effects. If you plan on using a different cog other than the KICKR core, you have to make sure it is ZWIFT compatible first. Workouts you can do with exercise bikes
Most exercise bikes have the same or similar functions. For example, there may be bikes that can connect to third-party apps and they may offer fitness classes with some differences. Exercises you may want to try while riding an exercise bike include:Low-intensity ride: If you've never used an exercise bike before, take time to get used to it. Start by riding for a short period, getting used to the resistance levels and making sure the seat height is set up for your body. Low-intensity rides can also provide cardiovascular benefits.High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): If you're used to riding on an exercise bike, then you're familiar with HIIT rides. You use short bursts of energy followed by a rest period and you can play around with the resistance to make the ride harder or easier. Additionally, it's a good way to get a quick workout in less than 30 minutes.Hills and sprinting: If you're focusing on improving your stamina and endurance, practicing cycling uphill with heavy resistance and sprinting on little to no resistance on an exercise bike is a good way to do so. You should also have the option to “Just Ride,” similar to Peloton, which doesn’t require connecting to a class. Other group fitness classes: You should be able to take workout classes other than cycling with an exercise bike.  Best practices on how to use an exercise bike
Adjust saddle and handlebars accordingly: One of the first things you have to make sure is set up correctly on an exercise bike is the seat (saddle) and handlebar height. This will vary by person but, ideally, you want the seat to be hip height.Wear the right shoes: Some exercise bikes may require clip-in shoes (just like Peloton), while others have cages that are appropriate for any sneaker. Make sure your feet are properly strapped in or clipped in before riding.Know all the exercise bike features: It helps to know which way to adjust the resistance on your exercise bike. If there is a touchscreen, it's helpful to know how to access the classes and other features on your device. Additionally, for safety reasons, it's important to know how to abruptly stop the bike in case of an emergency.
Exercise bike FAQs
Are exercise bikes good for weight loss?
Yes, exercise bikes are a great way for almost every body type to lose weight since it is low impact movement, so it's gentler on the joints. It's also a good way to get your heart rate elevated and moderate levels can add to the number of calories you burn in as little as a half hour. You can also play around with resistance as you get more comfortable riding for longer periods.
Show more
Is an exercise bike better than a treadmill?
This will depend on your abilities, fitness goals and preferences. If you are recovering from an injury or need to avoid an exercise that puts too much strain on your joints and knees, then an exercise bike is a better pick. But if you're training for a marathon, then a treadmill is the better choice since you need to practice running for distance. You can still use the bike for cross-training, though. If you prefer walking, jogging or running recreationally, then you may prefer a treadmill. But if you enjoy a low-impact form of cardio, then an exercise bike may be your preferred form of exercise. There is no right or wrong answer since it ultimately depends on which machine you will use regularly.
Show more
What is the max weight an exercise bike can hold?
This will vary per bike, but on average it can support riders up to 350 pounds. You'll also want to consider that exercise bikes aimed at performance-focused cyclists typically only support up to 250-pound riders. Be sure to confirm that the bike you're considering can support your body type before buying.
Show more
Is 30 minutes enough time to get a workout in on an exercise bike?
Yes, 30 minutes is plenty of time to get a good workout in on an exercise bike. It helps you maintain your cardiovascular health, but you may need to ride longer if your goal is to lose some weight.
Show more
What muscles does riding an exercise bike work?
Indoor cycling is a full-body workout. It targets your core, upper body, back, glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings and lower legs. Some bikes also include weights so you can more specifically target muscle groups in your arms.
