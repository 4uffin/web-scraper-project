Adjusting a training session to your daily routine can prove tricky, but if you want to start strength training, whether it's with help from guided classes or not, a smart home gym setup might be worth the investment. From AI-powered trainers to sleek workout mirrors and compact all-in-one machines, today's options are surprisingly versatile. I've spent years testing fitness gear and have narrowed it down based on cost, size, included memberships and overall performance. These are the best smart home gyms that live up to the hype and are worth every penny. Our Picks

Best smart home gym for strength training with free weights
Tempo Studio
Pros
Live and on-demand classes: HIIT, bodyweight cardio, yoga, boxing and more
3D sensors help correct your form and challenge you
Neatly stores all your weights and accessories
Cons
Expensive at $1,668
Requires a lot of room
Membership is an additional cost, starting at $139 a month
May not be challenging enough for more experienced lifters
What we like about it: The Tempo Studio is a smart home gym that resembles an armoire, meant to blend in with your home. It's an ideal smart home gym to own, whether you're new or experienced with strength training. The Tempo Studio's basic package comes well-equipped with two dumbbell bars, weight collars and five sets of weight plates from 1.25 to 25 pounds.The Tempo Studio is designed to hold all of its equipment neatly, so you won't need to worry about it being spread across your living room floor. The top part of the studio consists of the touchscreen, while the bottom part has a cabinet that stows the weight plates out of sight. The back of the Tempo Studio has slot-like compartments that hold the barbell and dumbbell bars securely and safely in place. I recommend making sure you have room for the Tempo Studio before purchasing because the stand itself is large, and you also need an additional 6 feet of space in front of the screen so your body can be detected during a workout. What makes the Tempo Studio stand out as ideal for strength training is that it uses artificial intelligence with 3D sensors to provide feedback on your form and movement during class. It can also count your reps and detect the dumbbell weights you're using. I was impressed by the feedback it gave me while doing a leg workout. Although it can be challenging to stay within the 6-foot parameters of the screen, the device can detect your movement and tell you if your form needs improvement or if it's on par. It can also read the weights you're using and recommend whether you should go heavier or lighter next time. It functions like a personal trainer and is helpful if you're new to strength training or want reinforcement on your form with certain exercises.There are various live and on-demand classes you can choose from, including HIIT, bodyweight strength, bodyweight cardio, weightlifting, yoga, boxing, stretching and meditation. Additionally, you can customize your workout experience by creating a program based on how many days a week you want to work out and for how long, and you can split them up by body part and rest days. If you want to exercise without personalization, you can still filter the collection of workouts by activity, modifications needed (for example: lower-back friendly, pregnancy-safe), the coach and equipment.Who it’s best for: The Tempo is best for someone who wants to strength train at home and wants a personal trainer feel to their workouts. If you have the room for it, it makes a great addition to an existing or new home gym. It comes with all the equipment you could need and stores away easily and neatly. Compared to some other smart home gyms, the Tempo personalizes your experience and gives you a taste of group fitness classes so you never get bored. The Tempo Studio memberships start at $139 (including a $100 equipment fee) a month with a 12-month commitment. After 12 months, the equipment is yours to keep, and the monthly cost is $39 for the training subscription. It lets you create up to six profiles, so everyone in your home can use it. Tempo also has an app that you can download (available for iOS and Android) and use while you're traveling.Who should avoid it: I would not recommend this smart home gym if you have limited space because it is 6 feet x 2 feet 2 inches x 1 foot 4 inches and weighs 100 pounds without the weights or accessories. Instead, if you really want to try the Tempo and have a small area to work with, I’d opt for the Tempo Move (the smaller version of the Studio). The Tempo Studio is an investment, so it’s not worth buying if strength training isn’t your preferred form of exercise.   ... Show more

Best smart treadmill
NordicTrack Commercial 2450
Pros
All heights can comfortably use this treadmill
Sleek look, with a giant 22-inch touchscreen
AutoAdjust technology simulates exercising outdoors
iFit membership offers a variety of classes at $39 a month
Cons
Expensive at $2,499
Requires a lot of space
What we like about it: The NordicTrack Commercial 2450 is our pick for the best smart treadmill. This treadmill is large but its size makes it versatile for tall and short individuals. It has a 22-inch HD touchscreen that tilts and pivots so you can adjust it for different uses, like if you want to take a workout class on the floor. The good news is that it does fold up, so you can prop up the belt when it's not in use. This treadmill has the ability to incline from zero to 15% and decline down to -3%. Runners and walkers can enjoy this treadmill because the speed goes from zero to 12 miles per hour. If you like interval training, the NordicTrack Commercial 2450 also has quick-touch control buttons on the console, which makes it easier to adjust your speed.One of iFit's stand-out features is that you can create your own trail using Google Maps to exercise anywhere in the world. Also impressive is NordicTrack's AutoAdjust technology, which allows an iFit virtual instructor to adjust your incline and speed during class. You could be running or walking in the jungle, and you'll notice the treadmill adjust to replicate that terrain. The same applies when you run on your own and choose your own location on Google Maps. This hands-free option lets you focus on the class without having to fuss with any buttons. It's also a good way for runners who need to train for a race to get the outdoor feel indoors. Who it’s best for: This treadmill is best for the serious runner who wants a real-life feel to their runs. The fact that NordicTrack uses AutoAdjust Technology is a good way to get a real feel during your run, even if you aren’t outside. The large 22-inch screen also gives you the ultimate experience during your workout. Like all NordicTrack equipment, you will need an iFit membership that costs $39 a month for a family plan or $15 a month for an individual plan. You'll have access to live and on-demand classes (also available in the iFit app), so you can enjoy a variety of workouts on and off the treadmill. The treadmill uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so you can connect workout headphones, a smartwatch or a heart rate monitor.Who should avoid it: This treadmill may not appeal to someone who is just trying to get a daily walk or jog in. You may find the bells and whistles on this treadmill to be a bit much if you aren’t as used to the latest forms of technology and aren’t planning on using it for serious mileage. Another downside is its size, 77.3 x 37 x 63.4 inches, which takes up a lot of space and may not work if you have limited room in your home.  ... Show more

Best smart rowing machine
Peloton Row
Pros
Quiet, which is appropriate if you live in an apartment
Form Assist teaches you how to row and improves form
Easy to operate if you're familiar with Peloton programs
Cons
Expensive for a rowing machine at $4,295
Large and may not fit all spaces at 8 x 2 feet
What we like about it: Peloton created the first smart rowing machine that teaches you how to row and corrects your form. Using this machine made me more aware of my rowing form, which I appreciated. It's appropriate for people of all heights and has a weight capacity of 300 pounds. The Peloton Row 24-inch HD touchscreen easily rotates for those times you want to work out on the floor while using your All-Access Peloton membership (an additional $44 a month). The Peloton Row provides a unique rowing experience that you won't get with other rowing machines. This rowing machine has sensors that detect the position of the handle and seat. The sensors help when calibrating your rowing form, which is important when taking a class because it ties into the Form Assist feature. Form Assist provides real-time feedback on your form using the sensors from the calibration process. During class, an image of a digital person on a rowing machine shows up on the screen and moves in sync with you.If your form is off, Form Assist alerts you by highlighting a specific body part in red where the stroke needs correction. You'll be able to see your form rating score at the end of class, which tells you how well you rowed, as well as where you made errors and tips on how to correct them. Who it’s best for: This rowing machine is ideal if you’re a beginner, have some experience with rowing but want to improve or are already a Peloton member. Although the price tag is steep ($3,295), the Peloton Row stands by its promise of making you a better rower. This machine is large, so you will need to make sure that you have room for it in your home. It’s also a quiet machine for being such a big rower, which is beneficial if you live in an apartment. During the workout, you’ll love how you can see the body parts you’re working and where you could use improvement with the data provided at the end of your workout. I improved my form after several sessions of working out on this rowing machine.Who should avoid it: If you aren’t a committed Peloton fan or own other Peloton equipment, you may be deterred by the price. It’s steep for a rowing machine and if you’re just looking to use it for cardio here and there you’re better off with a less expensive version. Another deterrent would be if you have minimal space in your home, because this is a large rowing machine (8 x 2 feet) that can’t be folded up when not in use.  ... Show more

Best smart exercise bike
Peloton Bike
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Engaging live and on-demand classes
Connects to multiple third-party apps
You can play your own music
All-Access Peloton membership gives you unlimited profiles
Cons
Expensive
Costs extra to purchase appropriate cycling shoes
Programming can get repetitive
What we like about it: CNET named the Peloton Bike the best exercise bike for a reason. The sleek signature look of the Peloton Bike is appealing because it looks like a sophisticated piece of equipment in the middle of your living room. It offers plenty of live and on-demand classes with its All-Access membership and lets you create up to 20 user profiles. The Peloton community is also what keeps its name relevant, as its members are supportive on and off the bike. Even if you're not in one of the live classes, you can still view your performance in real time alongside others who've taken the class. During a live class, you may get an encouraging high five from another member through the leaderboard, and offline, you can connect with your favorite instructors via social media.Who it’s best for: The Peloton Bike is ideal for those who want a classic smart exercise bike that provides an immersive group fitness experience. The Peloton Bike is best for someone who likes the feel of a group fitness class in the comfort of their home. The community aspect is a big driver for Peloton, so if you like connecting with other Peloton users, you’ll like this exercise bike. Who should avoid it: If you want a more basic bike, the Peloton might be more than you bargained for. It requires an All-Access membership at an additional cost of $44 a month, which you may not want to spend if you aren’t looking to take classes. The Peloton requires clip-on shoes, which normally cost extra unless you upgrade to a more expensive package.  ... Show more

Best smart home gym for serious weightlifters
Tonal 2
Pros
It is a space-saving, wall-installed machine
It's quiet, which works well if you don't want to disrupt the neighbors
It functions like a personal trainer
You aren't limited to just using it for the classes and you can do your own customized workout
Cons
Your walls have to meet the requirements to install Tonal
The price is high for a machine ($4,295) that doesn't include the cost of its own custom accessories or required professional installation
What we like about it: The Tonal 2 is the second version of Tonal, a strength training smart home gym that became popular in the fitness community, along with endorsements by athletes such as LeBron James and Serena Williams. It resembles a cable machine combined with a touchscreen TV and is intended to replace your dumbbells, barbells and weight plates while saving space in your home. It has 13 sensors to track your form and technique, while the smart handles and bar accessories (an optional, additional $495) have a gyroscope motion sensor that keeps track of your reps. The latest version of Tonal also includes a smart view, which allows you to view yourself as you do your workout and has an Aero feature, which allows you to use it for cardio or HIIT classes. Tonal 2 uses up to 250 pounds of total resistance and calibrates your weights for different exercises based on your initial fitness assessment. Before you start a workout, Tonal can also tell which muscle groups are fatigued on the day of your workout and make sure to work around them. Tonal offers thousands of on-demand and live workouts for beginners to advanced athletes. It even has five dynamic weight modes that make your workout harder and function like a personal trainer. If you don't want to take a class, you can use the Tonal on its own and customize your own workout while still receiving the same feedback you would in class. You can also connect your Amazon Music or Apple Music account and listen to your own music during your workout.  Who it’s best for: Tonal 2 is best for the serious weightlifter or someone who is into strength training, but wants more guidance during their workouts. They’ll appreciate the 250 pounds of total resistance and especially being able to view themselves as they do their workout. It is a big investment at $4,295, so it’s best for the exerciser who plans on being committed to using it. Who should avoid it: I would avoid buying the Tonal 2 if you know you aren’t going to be consistent with your strength training workouts. I also wouldn’t recommend it if you don’t have the space for it or the budget. The original Tonal was cheaper, and I didn’t find the upgrades to be worth the big price jump this time around. It also requires 7 feet of wall space and floor space. If the next iteration has more unique features and functions, then I might say the price point is worth it.  ... Show more

How we test smart home gym equipment
Each smart home gym is tested differently based on its category since no two are alike. We narrowed down the best smart home gyms based on each of their respective categories. These include treadmills, ellipticals and mirror gyms, all of which have been tested by various CNET editors over the years. Factors to consider when choosing a smart home gym
Budget: Smart home gyms tend to be expensive and can easily cost a minimum of $1,000. Therefore it's an investment you want to make sure is going to be worth it for your home and exercise preferences. Consider how much you're willing to spend and what's included in that price.Space: Many smart home gyms are relatively large pieces of equipment. Before purchasing one, make sure you have enough room to set it up and move around it. For example, if you're purchasing a machine such as a treadmill, it's ideal to look for one that folds for easier storage. Whereas if you are purchasing a smart fitness mirror you'll want to make sure that wherever you mount it there's still room to exercise in front of it.Versatility: Smart home gyms usually offer more than one function. If you're buying a smart home gym, make sure it also offers a variety of classes so you can build a well-rounded workout. If you want personal training, make sure the smart home gym offers it as an option.Membership: Since smart home gyms typically replace a gym membership, you'll want to make sure that the membership provided will allow multiple user profiles so your whole family can use it. Best practices for smart home gyms
Since the types of smart home gyms that exist vary across the board, there aren't best practices that apply to all of the ones on this list. Instead, there are some key things to keep in mind--particularly for treadmills, ellipticals and rowing machines.Best treadmill practices: Make sure to get clearance from your doctor first if you are pregnant, have been sick or recovering from an injury or surgery. Your treadmill workout should consist of a five to 10-minute warm-up, pace yourself and don't run too fast too soon, avoid holding on to the handrails and keep your arms by your side, but use them so you're a more efficient runner. Focus on running tall and light and relaxed to avoid any unnecessary tension.Best rowing machine practices: Learn the importance of the setup which is broken up into four parts known as the catch, drive, finish and recovery. If you're really interested in getting into rowing, it's recommended to learn the right technique from an expert.Best elliptical practices: Make sure to stand tall, keep your core engaged, and avoid slouching. Hold onto the handles and keep your feet flat and sturdy on the pedals when you pedal forward.
