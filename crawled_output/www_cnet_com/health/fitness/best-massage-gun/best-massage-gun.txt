Factors to consider when shopping for a massage gun
Price
Massage guns can cost about $100 or up to $600. Budget for the type you want and for your needs.
What type of massage gun
There are heavy-duty massage guns that are top-of-the-line and others that are less intense. Decide if your lifestyle requires a massage gun with all the bells and whistles or if you're OK with a basic style.
Vibration vs percussive massage therapy
Massage guns offer either vibration or percussive therapy. Vibration therapy sends vibrations and constantly touches the surface of the skin, whereas percussive therapy uses pressure to get deeper into the muscle and glides on and off of the skin.
Battery life
Battery life can vary depending on the massage gun, so it's something to consider if you're not looking to charge it all the time.
Portability
Some massage guns are designed for on-the-go use. Decide whether you need one that's easy to carry during your travels or if you prefer to keep it at home.

If you're prone to sore muscles, a massage gun can help speed up muscle recovery, improve your athletic performance and more. If you’ve never used one, sports chiropractor Grant Radermacher recommends the following: "Start with a small region of soft tissue and work with it for a maximum of 2 minutes.” As CNET’s fitness expert, my role is to offer honest, informative and helpful fitness advice and content in a world of misinformation. I tested approximately 20 top-rated massage gun brands, including Therabody and Hypervolt. I considered cost, design, portability, size and intensity during testing. Find the perfect one to soothe your achy muscles with this list of the best massage guns. Our Picks

TheraGun/CNETMy favorite massage gun overall was the Theragun Elite. As a fitness expert, I’m familiar with the functions of massage guns and have tested them for many years. I found the Theragun Elite to be easy enough to use for beginners and experienced fitness enthusiasts. The screen on the handle is simple to follow, so the massage gun speed and battery life are clear. The amplitude -- the ability to get deep into your muscles -- is on the higher side for a massage gun. Therabody is a well-respected brand with a wide range of recovery products, so you know you're getting a top-notch massage gun. If you're not a fan of the loud percussion noise that's normally associated with massage guns, you may prefer one of the quieter options on this list, such as the Ekrin Athletics Bantam.Best massage guns of 2025

Best massage gun overall
Theragun Elite
Pros
Easy to use for experienced and inexperienced users
It has carrying case for safe storage
OLED screen makes it easy to read settings
Can be controlled through Therabody app
Cons
Expensive at $400
120-minute battery life could be longer
On the louder side at 65-68 decibels
Why we like it: I liked the Theragun Elite the most because it’s a powerful, easy-to-use massage gun with a comfortable handle. It provides 40 pounds of pressure and has five built-in speeds, ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It also has an amplitude of 16 millimeters, which gets deeper into the muscles. The Elite has five attachments: a dampener, standard ball, wedge, thumb and cone. It also lets you access preset guided routines from the Therabody app (available for iPhone and Android) in case you need help getting started with your massage gun. Once turned on, I liked that the Elite has a screen that indicates its current speed setting and remaining battery. It's a powerful massager, falling between the Theragun Pro Gen 5 and the Theragun Prime. Who it’s best for: The Elite is more user-friendly than some of the other massage guns, thanks to the simplicity of its features, while having more power than the Prime. Both beginners and athletes will get good use from the Elite to break down knots and eliminate sore muscles. Physical therapists who use massage guns in their practice may find this massage gun to be a good option to have on hand for their patients.Who shouldn’t buy it: My one gripe with the Elite is that it's supposed to be one of Theragun's quieter massage gun models, but I still thought it was on the louder side, especially as you amp up the power. This might deter you from this model if you want a massage gun that is quieter. It also has a shorter battery life (120 minutes) than the other guns on this list and isn’t ideal to carry with you when you’re traveling since it isn’t compact. If you want to be able to carry your massage gun everywhere, then I would recommend one that is smaller, like the Theragun Mini or Ekrin Athletics Bantam.Editors' note: The Theragun Elite has since been discontinued, and this page will be updated as we re-test massage guns.  ...

Massage gun with best battery life
Ekrin Athletics B37S
Pros
Long battery life of 8 hours
Quieter than most massage guns at 35-55 decibels
The handle is angled for extra comfort
Has a carrying case
Cons
Expensive
May be a bit big for travel
Why we like it: I liked the Ekrin Athletics B37S Percussion Massager because of its eight-hour battery life. It has the longest battery life of all the massage guns on this list. The B37S has five adjustable speeds ranging from 1,400 to 3,200 percussions per minute. This includes up to 56 pounds of deep percussive force, which tackles those hard-to-reach knots. It also has four head attachments to choose from. This massage gun is sturdy and less bulky than other massage guns, and it has various features. The power button, found at the top of the handle, controls the speed and is easy to maneuver. Even at the lowest speed setting, the B37S felt powerful.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is best for people who don't want to recharge their device regularly. The B37S is on par with elite massage guns like Theragun and Hypervolt, but it beats both brands when it comes to battery life. The handle is angled and long enough that someone with bigger hands can comfortably hold it in their hand. It also comes with a sleek case for easy storageWho shouldn’t buy it: If you want a compact massage gun, the B37S is not the best choice. Even with a carrying case, this massage gun still takes up enough room that you’re better off with a smaller alternative.   ... Show more

Best mini massage gun for travel
Ekrin Athletics Bantam
Pros
Long battery life of 6 hours
Has a travel case
Powerful and lightweight at 1.1 pounds
Cons
Power and speed are controlled by the same button
What we like about it: I liked the Ekrin Athletics Bantam as a mini massage gun option. It's sleek, slim, lightweight, compact (the size of an iPhone) and comfortable to hold. It also has a six-hour battery life, which is long for most massage guns, let alone a mini. The Bantam comes with a travel case and four head attachments. You have more options than with its competitor, the Theragun Mini second generation, which only has three. The Bantam has three speeds ranging from 2,000 to 3,200 percussions per minute and provides 10 mm of amplitude and up to 35 pounds of pressure.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is best for someone looking for a mini massage gun that can be carried in a gym bag or purse. It can also be a good option for someone who doesn't want to fully commit to a full-size massage gun but still wants a solid option that provides plenty of muscle relief. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a full-size massage gun, you’re better off with one of the larger massage guns on the list. If you’re picky about the style of the handle of the massage gun and prefer something that sits more snugly in the hand, then the Theragun Mini 2nd generation is a better fit because it has an ergonomic handle.   ...

Best mini massage gun with the most power
Theragun Mini (2nd gen)
Pros
Smaller and lighter at 0.45 kg
Powerful for a small massage gun with 12 mm of amplitude
Can be used for travel or on the go
Cons
Battery life is still hard to determine
Could use a better travel case
What we like about it: The second-gen Theragun Mini packs a powerful punch. It's the improved Mini in the Theragun collection and it's a solid upgrade from the original. The second-gen Theragun Mini is quieter than the original Mini, 20% smaller and 30% lighter. This time around you get three attachments with your Mini instead of just the one that the original had. This massage gun has three speeds ranging from 1,750 to 2,400 percussions per minute. It has 12 mm of amplitude, which is deep for a mini massage gun. By comparison, the Bantam massage gun only has 10 mm of amplitude. The Theragun Mini second generation maintains the same solid ergonomic handle that the originaMini has to make up for its compact shape. The Mini's power button also controls the speed and uses lights to indicate the speed level. Another plus is that it's Bluetooth-enabled, so you can connect it to the Therabody app.Who it’s best for: The Theragun Mini is ideal if you want a mini massage gun that can easily fit into a gym bag or carry-on. The massage gun also comes with a soft case to protect it while you’re on-the-go. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a mini massage gun with more attachments, then opt for the Ekrin Bantam instead of the Theragun Mini.    ...

Best massage gun for serious athletes
Theragun Pro (5th gen)
Pros
Most powerful massage gun on list
20% quieter than previous model
Lighter than older version
Has customizable and preset programs
Cons
Expensive
May be intimidating for average person
Upgrades are not drastic compared to last version
The fifth generation of the Theragun Pro has an upgraded design compared to the previous model. It's 20% quieter, smaller and slightly lighter than the original (2.76 pounds vs. 2.91 pounds). Therabody kept the important features of its predecessor: an adjustable head angle, five speeds, a 150-minute battery life, 16 mm of amplitude and 60 pounds of pressure. New upgrades include customizable speed ranges and visually guided built-in routines through the OLED screen: Sleep, Warm Up, Recovery and Theragun Break. Other additions include a new attachment, the Micropoint, intended to increase stimulation. It also has a Bluetooth connection, so it's easy to manage from the Therabody app.Once turned on, it's noticeable that it's significantly quieter than the previous version. It's still powerful even at the lowest speed. Therabody kept the rotating arm, which makes it easy to target hard-to-reach areas.The downside to the newest Pro is that it's still the most expensive massage gun on this list. This may not be the best option for everyone since you can get a similar experience with a less expensive device. Athletes and others who are physically active all day would benefit the most from this full-featured massage gun.  ... Show more

Best massage gun for beginners
Lifepro Sonic Handheld Percussion Massage Gun
Pros
Quiet motor for a standard-size massage gun
LED display makes for easy-to-read settings
8 massage head options
Inexpensive at $60
Has a carrying case
Cons
It has to be set at the last two settings to really feel power
Plastic design makes it seem less durable
What we like about it: For a heavy-duty massage gun, the Lifepro's Sonic Handheld Percussion Massage Gun is on the quieter side. The battery lasts three to six hours and consists of five speeds, ranging from 1,200 to 2,800 percussions per minute. The Sonic also has the most massage head attachments (eight) of all the massage guns on this list. It’s affordable at only $60 if you're looking to spend under $100 on a massage gun.Who it’s best for: This massage gun is good for beginners because it is less intimidating than other heavy-duty massage guns. The battery is long-lasting, and it offers plenty of amplitude to get deep into sore muscles. The LED panel on the Sonic shows all the speeds and remaining battery life listed in one place, so it's easy to read. If you're new to percussive therapy, this is a good option that gives you the full experience without breaking the bank.Who shouldn’t get it: This massage gun is on the bigger side, so it's not suitable for traveling. If you want a more portable massage gun, consider one of the mini options instead. An issue I had with the Sonic was that I had to set it at the highest setting to feel the power of the massage gun. This is less common with heavy-duty massage guns, like the Theragun, because you can still feel the intensity at the lowest setting. Another aspect that could be improved on the Sonic is the design of the body of the gun. It's made up of plastic, which makes it seem less durable.   ... Show more

Best Theragun-dupe massage gun
Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun
Pros
Affordable at $70
Quiet for a big massage gun at 45 decibels
Good alternative to Theragun Pro 5th gen
You can change the massage head angle to hit hard-to-reach areas
Decent 4-hour battery life
Cons
Not as stylish as the high-end massage guns
Plastic design makes it seem cheap
What we like about it: The Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun may not look as sophisticated as the other massage guns on this list, but it is still effective. The R4 Pro has a rotating head that can be adjusted to five positions by pressing a large button on the side of the massage head. This feature reminded me of the Theragun Pro, which functions similarly. Being able to change the angle of the massage gun is key because you can target hard-to-reach areas. It has 10 mm of amplitude, so it doesn't penetrate as deeply as the Theragun Pro, but it still gets the job done. The R4 Pro has four speeds and comes with six attachments: L ball head, M ball head, fork, bullet, flat and air-cushioned head. Who it’s best for: If you want a massage gun that isn't expensive but has the features of a high-end one (minus the app function), the Renpho R4 Pro Massage Gun is a solid pick. After all, $70 is reasonable compared to spending hundreds of dollars on a massage gun with similar features. The massage gun has an easy-to-read panel that indicates the current speeds and battery level. The battery life on this massage gun is decent, lasting up to four hours. Who shouldn’t get it: If you want a heavy-duty massage gun that’s well-made, then this one may fall short. The plastic material makes it seem cheaper compared to a Theragun or even an Ekrin option. It’s also bulkier compared to other massage guns because of the curved arm. If you’d like the option to carry the massage gun in a gym bag or carry-on, it’s too big to be considered portable, even with the carrying case.  ... Show more

How we test massage guns
Design: Although massage guns have a standard shape, we looked at the designs and materials that make up each massage gun. Even if they look similar, the knobs, buttons and screens can vary per product.Amplitude: The amplitude or the depth of the massage is the key to owning a solid massage gun. The higher the amplitude, the deeper the massage gun can target your muscles. We looked at the amplitude and observed how the massage gun felt in use. Additionally, we consider the speed settings on each of these massage guns.Noise: Massage guns are known for their loud vibrations, so we observed the level of noise generated by each massage gun. Although you can't eliminate the noise created by the massage gun, we took into account the size and decibels. Features: We looked at any unique features the massage guns offered such as apps, screen display, attachments available, travel carrying cases and more. Certain features can appeal to both the average user and professionals like physical therapists who may use massage guns in their practice. Other massage guns we tested
Hypervolt 2 Pro: The Hypervolt 2's successor was louder and heavier than I would've liked, but it has five speeds and is a good option if you find the speeds on the Hypervolt 2 aren't enough.Hypervolt 2 Pro

Hypervolt Go 2: Hypervolt's travel-size massage gun fell short when it came to power. It also didn't come with a travel case. It's a good option if you prefer something quieter than the Theragun Mini.Hypervolt Go 2

Theragun Prime: This Theragun version seems too expensive for its simplicity. But if you're loyal to Theragun and prefer a simple massage gun, the Prime is your best bet. Theragun Prime

Theragun Pro (4th gen): This version didn't make the list because the fifth generation stepped things up a notch, and it's quieter.Theragun Pro 4th Generation

Vybe Pro Percussion: Compared to the other massage guns on this list, the design of the Vybe Pro looks less sophisticated, and its buttons feel easy to break. I also found the arm too long, which adds to its weight.Vybe Pro Percussion

Lifepro DynaMini: This mini lacked power unless you cranked it up to the two highest settings. It would have also benefited from a nonslip rubber coating on the handle, because the whole massage gun is made up of heavy metal. Lifepro DynaMini

Factors to consider when buying a massage gun
Budget: Think about how much you're willing to invest in a massage gun because a good one can cost anywhere from $100 to $600.Intensity: Determine if you're looking for a heavy-duty version or if you'd be happy with a less intense massage gun. Percussion or vibration therapy: Some massage guns offer either vibration or percussion therapy. Put simply, vibration therapy sends vibrations and constantly touches the surface of the skin, whereas percussive therapy uses pressure to get deeper into the muscle and glides on and off of the skin. The latter tends to be the preferred option of many. Frequency: Ask yourself how often you'll be using the massage gun. If it's frequent, you'll want to consider a massage gun with a decent battery life. Traveling: Determine if you're planning on taking it while traveling or on the go. There are smaller massage guns on the market that are suitable for these purposes, and some massage guns include carrying cases. Massage gun tips
If you're new to massage guns there are some things to keep in mind so you're getting the most out of them. We spoke with sports chiropractor and Hyperice ambassador Julia Morgan for advice on the best massage gun practices.Choosing the right massage gun: There are different types of massage guns on the market, so it's helpful to know if you want something heavy-duty because you're very active or if you don't need the massage gun with all the bells and whistles because you're only going to use it occasionally. Setting a budget for yourself is important, too, because some massage guns can go upwards of $100.Know what specs to look at: When choosing a massage gun, there are a couple of features you want to look at: The amplitude and stall force. "Stall force simply means how much pressure the motor of the massage gun can withstand before the motor 'stalls' with us," explains Morgan. Amplitude refers to how deep into the region it can go. You'll typically see amplitude in the range of 8mm, 12mm or 16mm as the deepest. Usually, heavy-duty massage guns have the highest amplitude compared to mini massage guns.Know the attachments: Most massage guns will come with a few different attachments that you can switch up depending on the area you're targeting. For example, the common attachments may include a standard ball which is good for large and small muscle groups, a bullet which is meant to target legs and back muscles, a forked head which is intended to target the spine, shoulders and neck, and a flat head which offers a gentler massage on the larger muscles.How often to use: Massage guns are safe to use regularly as long as there are no health concerns to address first. Morgan says, "Those with thin skin, who have underlying musculoskeletal or vascular conditions, or who are pregnant, should consult their doctor before use." Although massage guns are safe to use daily to soothe sore muscles or as part of a warm-up, it's important to ensure you're not experiencing chronic pain. "If you're using it every day on a pain that is not going away or getting better after two or three days, it may require another intervention," warns Morgan.Start slow: It may be tempting to put your massage gun in the highest setting, but the key is to start slow. "Gently glide the massage gun over the area, not holding for too long in one position," Morgan says. Use the massage gun in different directions and work on that area for about a few minutes, and take a break as needed. How to use a massage gun
There are different ways to use a massage gun whether you're an athlete or are simply looking for some muscle relief. These are some effective ways to use a massage gun:Use it before bed: Some people find using a massage gun before bed to be soothing. "A massage gun when used on a low setting can be super relaxing due to the increased blood flow and decreased perception of pain it results in," Morgan says. Don't forget your upper body: Because many people have jobs that require them to sit, the upper body usually ends up tense. "I think everyone can use a little love on their upper trapezius, quads and glutes a few times a week," Morgan says. She says spending about two minutes per body part at the beginning or end of your day can help bring awareness, decrease pain perception and improve the range of motion in the area.Use before or after workout: Crank up a massage gun for a few minutes to soothe your sore muscles after a workout or beforehand as part of your warm-up routine.

He says you should never be forceful with a massage gun, adding, "You don't want constant pressure on one area the entire time, instead let it glide over the muscles."

Is it OK to use a massage gun every day?
Massage guns are safe to use every day, as long as you use the proper technique, but you don't want to overdo it since it can reduce the benefits of the therapy. Grant Radermacher, a sports chiropractor, says, "Start with a small region of soft tissue and work with it for a maximum of 2 minutes." Anything longer than two minutes or static work can irritate the region, and/or create an adverse reaction of restricted blood flow due to compression.
