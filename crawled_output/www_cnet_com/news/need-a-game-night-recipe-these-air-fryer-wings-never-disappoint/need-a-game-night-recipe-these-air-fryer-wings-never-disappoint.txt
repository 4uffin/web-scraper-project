Buffalo sauce is my go-to for air fryer wings but you can't go wrong with any flavor. Corin Cesaric/CNET
Whether you're craving them for dinner or a game day snack, there's a simple science behind cooking perfect air fryer chicken wings. And most important, there's one crucial step you can't forget. When laying your seasoned wings in your air fryer basket, you'll want to ensure that you always cook them in a single, even layer. Overcrowding the air fryer or stacking the wings will result in uneven cooking, or worse, soggy wings.If you're making a larger batch than what fits in one layer, cook the wings in multiple batches to ensure there is no overlapping. While the wings will shrink as they cook, it's still important to give each piece enough space to crisp up properly. Best Air Fryers of 2025, Tested and Reviewed

You have no shortage of sauce options or spice combos to try when making air fryer wings -- so don't be afraid to experiment. As long as you nail the cooking steps and don't under- or overcook them, you're likely to end up with a restaurant-quality snack that costs a fraction of the price and takes very little effort to whip up. Here's how to nail air fryer chicken wings every time.Ingredients for buffalo chicken wings1 pack chicken wings (about 15 wings)1/2 cup Frank's RedHot hot sauce2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted1 tablespoon olive oil 1 teaspoon garlic powder1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon pepperHow to make air fryer chicken wings in 25 minutesStep 1: Pat dry the chicken wings and place them in a large mixing bowl and drizzle olive oil over them.Step 2: Combine the seasonings and sprinkle them on the wings, then mix well so that the meat is fully covered.
The four seasonings you will need for air fryer chicken wings. Corin Cesaric/CNETStep 3: Place the wings in a single layer in the air fryer and cook at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, then flip them and cook for another 10 minutes. Do not overcrowd the air fryer. Cook them in multiple batches if needed.
Don't stack the chicken wings in the air fryer. Instead, make sure they're all in a single layer. Corin Cesaric/CNETStep 4: While the wings are cooking, melt the unsalted butter in a small saucepan. Add Frank's RedHot hot sauce (or a hot sauce of your choosing) and simmer on low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
If you would rather use a buffalo sauce instead of traditional hot sauce, you do not need to add butter to this recipe.  Corin Cesaric/CNETStep 5: When the wings are done cooking and have reached an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit, place them in a clean mixing bowl and pour the buffalo sauce mixture over them.
These air fryer chicken wings are simple and quick, making them perfect for a weeknight meal.  Corin Cesaric/CNETStep 6: Toss the wings until they're fully coated and serve immediately with dipping sauce, carrots and celery.
These wings are perfectly crispy every time. Corin Cesaric/CNETRead more: 7 of the Best Air Fryer AccessoriesAir fryer wings FAQ
How long does it take to cook chicken wings in the air fryer?
Cook your wings for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Farenheit.

You should toss your wings in a small amount of oil and your seasonings of choice. However, you should not coat them with sauce before cooking them. Save that step for last.
