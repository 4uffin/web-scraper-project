These 20 Kitchen Gadgets Are a Complete Waste of Money, According to Chefs
I asked professional chefs about the most gimmicky and overrated kitchen tools. Here are 20 you want to skip.
David Watsky Senior Editor / Home and Kitchen David lives in Brooklyn where he's spent more than a decade covering all things edible, including meal kit services, food subscriptions, kitchen tools and cooking tips.
David earned his BA from Northeastern and has toiled in nearly every aspect of the food business, including as a line cook in Rhode Island where he once made a steak sandwich for Lamar Odom.
Right now he's likely somewhere stress-testing a blender or tinkering with a toaster. Anything with sesame is his all-time favorite food this week. Expertise Kitchen tools | Appliances | Food science | Subscriptions | Meal kits

Save your money and skip these 20 kitchen tools. Peter Stark / Getty
With endless kitchen tools and gadgets promising faster food prep and better results, it's easy to find yourself with a cluttered kitchen. A handful of dependable tools will carry you much farther than a drawer full of gimmicks -- at least that's what the culinary experts I spoke to suggest. Professional chefs stick to basics like sharp knives, sturdy cutting boards, and reliable pans because they work and they last. Those are the types of tools that help you build confidence in the kitchen instead of adding clutter.20 Kitchen Tools Worthy of a Splurge
See at CNET
To separate the essential from the superfluous or downright useless, we asked culinary pros to share the tools they swear by and the gadgets they'd skip. Their advice will help you avoid falling for flashy products and instead invest in items that you'll reach for every single day. When decluttering your kitchen, you'll have to make some tough decisions but we're here to help.Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Masaharu Morimoto Celebrity chef, restaurateur
Masaharu Morimoto shared his pick for the most overrated kitchen tool. Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images1. Mandolin
Chef Morimoto encourages beefing up your knife skills to make thin and uniform vegetable slices. Milk StreetWhy: "While it brings good slices, mastering proper knife skills gives you more control, precision and safety in the long run. Mandolins can be bulky, hard to clean and risky if you're not extremely careful. Relying too much on a mandolin, or tools like a two-in-one apple cutter or a tomato corer can hold you back from developing real technique. Taking the time to learn how to handle a sharp chef's knife or Japanese blade will help you in almost every recipe." What to try instead: Mac 8-inch Japanese chef knife.Best Chef Knives, Tested by CNET

Culinary instructor Eric Rowse knows a gimmicky kitchen tool when he sees one. Institute of Culinary Education2. Onion holdersWhy: "These look like a weapon for Wolverine wannabes; it's meant to help you hold a whole onion and "chop" it. Instead, cut the onion in half to create a flat surface so it won't roll away. If you're trying to cut rings, save the $14 and stick a fork in the root and hold the fork."What to try instead: Learn to properly slice an onion the old-fashioned way.3. Onion goggles
Save your money -- and some dignity -- and skip the onion goggles. Rubberball/Mike Kemp/Getty ImagesWhy: "A waste of money, as they don't form a great seal around the eyes to prevent the sulfur compounds from getting to your eyes and making you cry. Keep your knife sharp and open a window or turn on a fan instead."What to try instead: CNET's Peter Butler shares tips for cutting onions without crying.4. Metal, glass, stone and acrylic cutting boards
Glass, stone and metal boards are OK for serving but when slicing and dicing, wood is the way to go. David Watsky/CNETWhy: "Cutting on hard surfaces is bad for your knives; instead, go for wood or poly."What to try instead: Our list of the best cutting boards features plenty of knife-safe options. 5. Chicken shredder
Two forks are all you need to successfully shred chicken. bhofack2/GettyWhy: "I can't think of anyone needing a tool devoted to shredding chicken outside a restaurant and even restaurants don't use it. This item only has one purpose so I'd skip it."What to try instead: Two forks.6. Herb stripperWhy: "I love thyme but hate stripping it. When I was young I got suckered into believing this tool would help me … It's been sitting in my cupboard, laughing at me for almost a decade now."What to try instead: For heartier herbs like rosemary and thyme, just use your fingers to slide down the stem, opposite to how the leaves grow.7. Bluetooth wireless probe thermometer
Instant read meat probes work fast and don't require a fussy Bluetooth connection. Chris Wedel/CNETWhy: "These are a great tool but can be very expensive. I can see myself losing, breaking, dropping, accidentally throwing away or dropping it in the coals."What to try instead: ThermoPro's Lightning Instant Read ThermometerPeter Som Cookbook author and lifestyle expert
Cookbook author Peter Som didn't hold back when asked about his least favorite kitchen tools. Peter Som8. Electric can opener
A manual can opener is cheaper, works great and is less likely to break. Nelson Aguilar/CNETWhy: "Most of us grew up with an electric can opener permanently stationed on the kitchen counter, like it was a vital appliance. But truthfully, they're more nostalgia than necessity. They take up space, can be a hassle to clean and often struggle with irregularly sized cans. A good manual opener is compact, reliable and gets the job done without needing an outlet or a user manual."What to try instead: Oxo's soft-handled can opener.Richard Ingraham Personal chef to Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union and author of Love: My Love Expressed Through Food
Richard Ingraham avoids certain kitchen tools when cooking for celebs like Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union. John Parra/Getty Images9. Avocado slicerWhy: "A knife and spoon do the job just as easily and the specialized tool rarely fits all avocado sizes properly. It's a one-trick pony that clutters drawers."What to try instead: A good paring knife like this $35 Wusthof10. Egg separator
Separating an egg by hand isn't so difficult that it requires hardware. Yipengge/Getty ImagesWhy: "A tool just for separating yolks is unnecessary for most home cooks." The only exception may be this one, and even that is just for yolks. Err, I mean yucks.What to try instead: Cracking an egg and using the shell halves or your fingers works just as well. 11. Garlic peeler tubeWhy: "Rolling garlic cloves in a silicone tube may work but requires storing a single-purpose gadget."What to try instead: Smashing garlic cloves with a chef knife is quicker and more reliable.12. Pizza scissors
Chef Ingraham says skip the scissors on pizza night. Zoranm/Getty ImagesWhy: "A pizza cutter or knife works better and faster. These scissors are gimmicky, awkward to clean and take up more space than they're worth."What to try instead: KitchenAid's stainless-steel pizza wheel. Best Pizza Ovens for 2025
See at CNET
13. Herb scissorsWhy: "They're hard to clean and don't offer a huge advantage over a sharp chef's knife. Plus, they tend to crush delicate herbs more than slice them."What to try instead: Made In's 8-inch Chef Knife.14. Electric egg cookerWhy: "Boiling eggs in a pot is straightforward and flexible. The electric version just adds clutter unless you boil eggs constantly and hate using a stove."What to try instead: This 1-minute hack for making poached eggs in the microwave.15. Butter cutter and dispenser
A good butter knife works just as well and requires less space and maintenance.  Williams SonomaWhy: "It slices sticks of butter into pats … but why? A knife works instantly and you don't have to load and clean a plastic gadget for it."What to try instead: Williams Sonoma breakfast butter blade.16. Pasta measurerWhy: "It's a plastic disc with holes to tell you how much spaghetti to cook. Just eyeball it or learn the rough weight by experience. It's not worth the drawer space."What to try instead: A kitchen scale for precise measurements.17. Oil misterWhy: "Often clogs, sprays unevenly and requires constant cleaning. A small spoon or brush does the job with less frustration."What to try instead: World Market's olive oil cruet.18. Electric potato peeler
A sharp vegetable peeler is all you need to skin a batch of potatoes. Capelle.r/Getty ImagesWhy: "Takes up a surprising amount of space and peels slower than a regular peeler. Plus, it's overkill unless you're peeling dozens of potatoes at once."What to try instead: Oxo's Swivel peeler.19. Bagel guillotineWhy: "Sold as a safer way to slice bagels but takes up a ton of space and is awkward to clean. A serrated knife does the job just fine."What to try instead: Opinel's 8-inch bread knife. Jackie Carnesi Executive chef, Kellogg's Diner
Jackie Carnesi StarChefs20. Oven mitts
There's a reason pro chefs don't use oven mitts. WebstaurantWhy: "Oven mitts are the most useless item in a home kitchen. A sturdy kitchen towel does the same job, and odds are, it's more likely to be washed regularly. I don't know many people who wash their oven mitts frequently enough ... it seems many have deemed it an item that doesn't warrant regular cleaning. It does."What to try instead: Stock a plethora of kitchen towels.
