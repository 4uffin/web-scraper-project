These Houseplants Can Naturally Purify The Air in Your Home
Breathe easier when you add these plants to your home.
David Watsky Senior Editor / Home and Kitchen David lives in Brooklyn where he's spent more than a decade covering all things edible, including meal kit services, food subscriptions, kitchen tools and cooking tips.
David earned his BA from Northeastern and has toiled in nearly every aspect of the food business, including as a line cook in Rhode Island where he once made a steak sandwich for Lamar Odom.
Right now he's likely somewhere stress-testing a blender or tinkering with a toaster. Anything with sesame is his all-time favorite food this week. Expertise Kitchen tools | Appliances | Food science | Subscriptions | Meal kits

Nobody wants to walk in the front door, take a deep breath and taste stale air. Air purifiers might be the go-to solution for purifying the air with technology, but Mother Nature has another option: houseplants. Choosing the right plants for your home can improve the air quality, filter some common toxins and add a pop of green to your decor. Beyond their air-purifying benefits, houseplants are known to reduce allergens, deter pests and even help regulate humidity to keep your home feeling comfortable. They're also a proven way to boost your mood and create a more relaxing space. If you're looking for the best houseplants to purify your air and enhance your home, here are the top expert-recommended picks to get you started.The 10 Best Places to Buy Plants Online

Can plants really purify air? Before we get carried away with what plants can actually do to purify air, most modern science suggests you'd need hundreds of plants to make a significant difference in air quality. But tech startup Neoplants claims its proprietary solution can supercharge plants to clean air 30 times faster.  While the effectiveness is up for debate, one thing is clear: Adding plants to your home won't hurt the air quality. So, whether you're hoping to neutralize toxins from a clunky HVAC or old stove or simply looking to freshen the stale, musty air in your home, here are four plants known for air purification.  Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Best houseplants for air purification
Researchers at the University of Washington have genetically modified a common houseplant -- pothos ivy -- to remove chloroform and benzene from the air around it.  Mark Stone/University of WashingtonMultiple studies have proven that certain plants can absorb polluting organic compounds like formaldehyde and benzene through their leaves and roots. That absorption purifies the air around the plant.
A NASA study even highlighted several plants that excelled in cleaning the air around them. If you're looking to breathe easier, but don't want to purchase an air purifier, choose one of these plants for their ability to improve indoor air quality.
Marble queen pothos or devil's ivy (Epipremnum aureum)
The marble queen pothos cleans air as well as any other houseplant. David Watsky/CNETThe devil's ivy, also known as golden pothos, is a great air-purifying plant, known to remove harmful VOCs such as formaldehyde, benzene and toluene. It's particularly well-suited for those who have trouble keeping plants alive. The pothos is nearly impossible to kill -- hence the diabolical nickname -- and needs watering only every seven to 10 days.  The pothos is so proficient at cleaning that biotech startup Neoplants uses this species for its microbiome-charged air-purifying system that turns an ordinary houseplant into an air-cleaning machine that removes the same amount of toxins as 30 plants.  On the downside, the marble queen pothos is not particularly pet-friendly and contains toxins that can harm your four-legged friend if ingested.
Peace lily (Spathiphyllum)
Peace lilies are a good choice for homes without much direct sunlight.  Getty ImagesNamed for the white blooms reminiscent of a surrender flag, these budding beauties remove formaldehyde, benzene and carbon monoxide from the air around them. Peace lilies can grow up to 16 inches tall and don't need direct sunlight but they do require regular watering.
English ivy (Hedera helix)
English ivy can reduce the amount of airborne fecal matter in your home.  Getty ImagesAccording to NASA's study, English ivy is a fantastic plant to grow indoors if you're looking for air-filtering ability.  English ivy absorbs formaldehyde, found in some household cleaners, and can reduce the amount of airborne fecal matter. However, it should be kept out of the reach of any pets, as it can be poisonous if ingested.
Gerbera daisy (Gerbera jamesonii)
Gerbera daisies add color and pack an air-cleaning punch.  Getty ImagesThis bright and colorful flower packs a pollutant-absorbing punch, filtering out trichloroethylene and benzene, chemical compounds found in cleaners and solvents. Gerbera daisies do need plenty of direct sunlight, so keep your plant in a well-lit area and be sure to water frequently. These exotic-looking flowers are quite simple to grow. For more gardening and plant hacks, read about how to grow vegetables and how to change the color of your hydrangeas.
FAQs
What is a good plant to put in my bedroom?
The snake plant is great for the bedroom, as it releases oxygen at night rather than during the day. This can help keep your air fresh while you sleep, improving your chances of a restful night's slumber.
Can houseplants replace a dedicated air purifier?
No. While houseplants can cycle air and remove some pollutants, they do not handle the biggest problem with indoor air quality: dust and fine particulate matter. Experts recommend air purifiers for every home so that they can filter out dust, smoke, mold, pollen and other allergens and irritants. In fact, houseplants -- including some on this list -- can lose their efficiency if their leaves get dusty; they can benefit from the dust-filtering of an air purifier just as much as you.
What are good plants for a beginner?
Succulents are good plants for beginners because they're extremely hardy and don't need to be watered too often. There's also a wide variety of succulents, which means you're likely to find one that fits your aesthetic preferences.
Is it possible for me to overwater my plants?
Yes, it's possible to overwater your plants, especially houseplants like succulents and the ZZ plant. The extra water can kill the roots and wilt the plants, drowning and killing them.
