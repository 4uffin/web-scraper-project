Over the past months, CNET has been exploring the latest camping equipment, including tents, grills, coolers, solar lights, firepits, camping cookware and much more.

Make sure you have enough room, because you’re about to add a lot to your camp wish list. You're welcome. Read more: Best Camping Cookware for Your Summer Adventures

Best sleeping tent/hammock
Haven Safari Tent
Pros
Durable design, serves as your tent, hammock and bed
Packs down really nicely, easy to transport
Comfortable enough to sleep in on your back and sides
Cons
Only good for camping in dense woods, extension straps needed if otherwise
A little expensive for a camping hammock
Not good for couples, only big enough for one person
Why I like it: I love camping, but I’ve always struggled to sleep on camping trips. Air mattresses always deflate beneath me, and I don’t have the money to really glamp-out on an RV. For me, the Haven Safari Tent is the answer to my camping prayers. It provides a suspended sleeping experience that’s super cozy, with a sleeping pad and a tent enclosure. The tent itself is designed to be breathable or insulated, based on what you need. It also comes with a waterproof rainfly for damp environments, and is durable enough to handle a lot of weight at once.Who is this for:This is mainly for solo campers looking for an elevated sleeping experience. Since you’re off the ground, you feel relatively weightless while sleeping, and you also don’t have to worry about critters crawling into your sleeping bag. The Haven Safari is also best for campers who are in a heavily wooded area, without a multitude of trees, you could struggle with finding the right place for this setup.Who shouldn’t buy it:This is definitely not suitable for couples. It only is able to sleep one person at a time -- unless you both really like to cuddle close. It’s also not the proper haven tent for backpackers, as this model, being the most supportive, is also a bit too heavy. Luckily, Haven as a brand makes a bunch of other more lightweight hammock tents that are perfect for backpacking, or those who just want more of a lightweight setup.-JD Christison  ... Show more

Best camping water bottle and filtration system
Grayl Geopress Filtered Water Bottle
Pros
Fast; makes 24 fluid ounces of clean water in less than 10 seconds
Efficiently filters water from outdoor sources like lakes, streams, rivers
You can add electrolyte packet mixes to your water
Cons
On the expensive side at $100 plus $30 for cartridge replacements
Doesn't pack down (like a water bladder design), so it will always take up the same amount of space in your bag, even if it's empty
Requires quite a bit of force while pressing it down
Why I like it: The Grayl GeoPress is among my best outdoor gear purchases. I feel confident drinking water from lakes, rivers and even the sketchiest of sources with this filtered water bottle -- and that's saying something, because I nearly bit the dust by acquiring three strains of E. Coli from contaminated water at one point (before I knew about Grayl). It efficiently removes waterborne pathogens, including 99.9999% of bacteria, viruses and protozoa, and filters particulates like silt, microplastics, pesticides, heavy metals and more. This thing purifies water fast -- I'm talking the whole bottle in less than 10 seconds. I no longer have to sit around and burn daylight waiting for the water to filter while hiking or camping. I like the bottle’s grippy exterior; I'm less likely to drop it when it's wet or my grip strength is lacking. The "RiverFlow" spout is wide and allows for a fast water flow, which is nice when you’re thirsty and want to replenish quickly and easily. Who is this for: I'd venture to say that the Grayl GeoPress filtered water bottle is ideal not just for outdoor enthusiasts, but for anyone who cares about the quality of water they're drinking. If you live or travel where the tap water is questionable, this is a great product to have on hand. Plus, it will help prevent buying single-use bottled water, which can save money and waste in the long run. It's suitable for hikers and campers who don't want to lug a bunch of water in their bags (as long as there are water sources to pull from along your route). Who shouldn’t buy it: If you don't expect to use your filtered bottle often, it may not be worth the purchase. If you're prioritizing ultra-lightweight gear, this may be too heavy -- something like a LifeStraw may better suit your needs. Also, do not use this in areas with toxic water (like blue-green algae) or industrial disasters.  There is a slight learning curve with the Grayl GeoPress bottle, and pressing it down requires some force and physical exertion. However, don't be discouraged if it doesn't seem to want to budge right away--it took me a few times until I figured it out. -Aly Lopez  ... Show more

Best camping lantern
LuminAID PackLite Max Solar Lantern and Charger
Pros
Built-in solar charger
Lightweight & waterproof
Great for all varieties of camping
You can charge your devices with it
Cons
Solar charging can be unreliable
Handle is fragile
A bit expensive at $60+
Why I like it:The LuminAID solar camping lantern is one of the most versatile outdoor products I’ve ever used. It packs down incredibly small, only one inch thick when compressed and because it has a built-in solar charging panel, you can attach it to your backpack and it can charge while you’re hiking to your camping spot. This makes it ideal for multiday backpacking trips. Once you get your destination you can inflate it to its normal size. It gives off a lot of light with three different brightness settings.Also you can simply charge it with a standard micro-usb at home so it is good to go before your trip. According to LuminAid, the battery will last 50 hours on a single charge and as long as I put it in the sun for a little while every day I have never had it die on me. There is also a more affordable model for $33 that works the same way, except it won’t charge your phone. Who is this for:I think this lantern is so versatile it can work for almost everyone. It provides great light, it's reliable, it's durable (aside from the handle), it packs away neatly, it charges with the sun and it can charge your phone depending on the model you choose. Who shouldn't buy it: The only people who this might not work for are people who want something really big and robust for a camping lantern. The only issue I ran into is that the plastic handle that you hang the lantern from can be a bit fragile, although it didn’t alter the functionality.The new model appears to have a new, velcro handle which may have fixed the issue.  It is also super lightweight, which is great for backpackers especially, but there is a chance it could blow away in heavy wind.-Owen Poole  ...

Best camping blanket/sleep solution
686 Waterproof Blanket
Pros
Water-resistant exterior and insulated interior keep you warm and dry
Versatile; easily converts into a poncho with a hood
Packs nicely into the waterproof carrying case for easy transport
Cons
Too heavy for backpackers seeking a lightweight blanket at 3 pounds, 12.8 ounces
Retailing on the expensive side (though it's often on sale) at $170
Only available in one size
Why I like it: I've camped in snow, rain and hot weather. I’ve used it on dirt, rocks, grass and sand. The 686 Waterproof Hooded Puffer Blanket keeps me warm and dry, whatever the weather brings, making it a must-have for all my camping and outdoor adventures. It’s been a staple on our camping trips for nearly four years and is still in pristine condition. Built with 686’s infiDry waterproof material, it's durable and easy to keep clean. It features Infiloft insulation, providing considerable warmth and coziness, whether you're using it as a blanket or wearing it as a poncho (yes, it even has a hood). There's also a hidden fleece-lined pocket for securing important items like your phone or keys. Who is this for: This blanket is for anyone seeking a waterproof option while enjoying the great outdoors. It's perfect for adding a layer of protection underneath you while tent sleeping, lounging around the campfire, keeping dry in the rain, picnicking, relaxing on the beach or napping in the backyard. I recommend throwing it in the back of your car so you always have it for whatever adventure awaits. It's also great for wet, muddy pups -- my husky truly thinks this is his blanket. He knows we're about to embark on a fun journey any time I pull it out. Who shouldn’t buy it: Because this blanket is heavier and takes up a bit of space, it's not suited for ultralight backpackers going on long hiking trips. It also may not provide enough protection in extreme weather conditions. The 10k waterproof and 10k breathability rating means the fabric can withstand water pressure of 10,000 millimeters (10 meters) before water penetrates. It's the industry standard for outerwear like snow pants and jackets. That means it's suitable for moderate, sustained rain and snow, but may not be enough in heavy downpours. -Aly Lopez  ...

Best camping mosquito repellent
Thermacell E-Series Mosquito Repeller
Pros
Effect with a 20-foot range
No scent and pet/kid safe
Rechargeable battery that can last a whole evening
Cons
Refills are pricey at $20
Doesn't work while actively charging
Why I like it:Made by Massachusetts-based company Thermacell, this line of mosquito defense devices works by diffusing a scentless, invisible mosquito repellent into the air. The magic? It doesn't smell, doesn't stick to your skin and it actually works.I've been testing the smallest in the lineup, the Thermacell E-Series, with a fast charging dock. For around $40, this little puck creates a 20-foot bubble of bug-free bliss. It's available at REI, Amazon and other retailers, and it might just be the best $40 you spend this summer (that isn't on frozen margarita mix).The rechargeable device releases a trickle of vapor, similar to an oil diffuser, that contains a synthetic version of a chemical found in the chrysanthemum flower. In my testing, it worked just as advertised. I ran the Thermacell around my outdoor dining table and lounge setup on five evenings during twilight when bugs are particularly ravenous. My yard has a pool, so you can only imagine the sort of swarms that descend on the space during summer. Each time, friends and I waited until we felt the first bites and broke out the Thermacell, placing it in the middle. In all five instances, the bug bites stopped as the mist made its way out of the softball-sized device. While bites were neutralized, we could still see the occasional mosquito darting about. Who is this for:Those looking for a stationary and effective mosquito repellent that's safe for anyone. Who shouldn't buy it: Campers who need a repellent they can take on hikes and while moving around. -David Watsky  ... Show more

Best camping Bluetooth speaker
Anker Soundcore Boom 3i
Pros
Compact, rugged design saltwater-resistance
Floats floats and "auto-corrects" to keep the speaker drivers facing upward
Good sound for its size with a reasonable amount of bass
Built-in light show
Emergency alarm
Cons
A little overpriced at its list price
Audio warbles if a wave washes over the speaker in water
Can distort a little at higher volumes
Why I like it:In some ways, Anker's new Soundcore Boom 3i is the spiritual successor of the company's popular Soundcore Motion Plus speaker that was released in 2020. It's similarly shaped but has more of an outdoor adventure slant with Anker calling it "built for the wild" and billing it as the first Bluetooth speaker with playback in water, as it floats and "auto-corrects" to keep the speaker drivers facing upward just above the surface. As you'd expect from a speaker that promotional photos show strapped onto a kayak (it does have a detachable carrying strap), the Soundcore Boom 3i is fully waterproof and dust-resistant, with an IP68 rating. Anker takes things a step further, touting the Boom 3i as "5X" saltwater-resistant.You shouldn't expect audiophile sound from a mono Bluetooth speaker of this ilk. But for the most part, the Soundcore Boom 3i gives you what you want from a portable Bluetooth speaker from a sound perspective. By that I mean it plays loud for its size -- it weighs about 1.8 pounds and measures 8.3 by 3.1 by 3.3 inches -- plus it puts out a reasonable amount of bass and has fairly respectable clarity. You can find speakers that sound a little more natural, but these types of rugged portable speakers aren't designed for critical listening (it can distort a little at higher volumes).I tested the speaker's playback in water and indeed it flipped over, so the speaker drivers were facing up, and the music kept playing, though the audio got a little garbled when a little wave passed over the speaker, and the drivers started spitting water out. The speaker also has another interesting feature: Holding down the "BassUp" bass-boost button for 5 seconds sets off a 96-decibel emergency alarm -- Anker says it's clearly audible at up to 100 meters -- with flashing red LED lights (yes, the speaker has a built-in light show). You can hit any button to turn the alarm off. Who is this for:Someone looking for a compact, durable speaker that sounds decent and is relatively affordable.Who shouldn't buy it: Those looking for a larger boom box Bluetooth speaker that delivers bigger sound.-David Carnoy  ...

Best camping cooler
Cabela's Polar Cap Equalizer 80-quart cooler
Pros
Tested to keep goods colder for 20% longer than the next leading cooler
Available in several different sizes
Extra durable and designed to be bear-proof
Pressure relief valve
Built-in can openers
Rubberized feet
Cons
A pricier cooler starting around $300
Not too many extra features that some tricked out coolers have
Why I like it: The last time I tested coolers for this list, I had Cabela's 60-quart version of this cooler listed as the best large cooler. That title is now held by a Magellan Outdoors model. In the big picture, if you want stuff to stay cold, you literally can't beat Cabela's Polar Cap option. Its lowest internal temperature during testing was the coldest, but the real treat was the fact that it held that low-level temp for around 20% longer than the next best contender.The prices range from $300 to $400 for the 60-, 80- and 100-quart models, and what you're paying for is undoubtedly performance. There aren't many crazy features on this unit, but it does have bottle openers built into the rubber latches, a pressure relief valve to help open the cooler when the interior pressure rises, and rubber-padded feet to elevate the cooler and help reduce direct heat transfer. Oh, and it's certified bear-resistant.Who is this for:Campers who want a truly durable cooler ready for anything that happens outdoors -- while keeping goods cold longer than any other option. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don't want to drop a couple hundred dollars on a cooler.-Steve Conaway  ... Show more

Best camping backpack
Bluetti Handsfree 2 Backpack
Pros
High-capacity 512Wh battery included in an all-in-one design with a backpack
Fast AC charging (600W input, 80% in 45 minutes) and efficient solar charging (350W input, full in 2 hours)
Five output options, including AC, USB-C and USB-A
Multiple charging options, including AC charging, solar charging and car charging
Cons
The base unit doesn't include a solar panel
60L backpack is 16.5 pounds empty and 45-50 pounds when fully packed
The power station takes up a large part of the backpack’s interior space
Why I like it: The Bluetti Handsfree 2 was the perfect addition to my gear because I prefer glamping to camping. I like the option of carrying my electronics with me into the wild and charging my devices while camping. Normally, this would require you to carry a heavy portable power station separately from the rest of your camping gear, but the Handsfree 2 makes this a lot easier by pairing a 60-liter, capacious backpack with a heavy-duty 512Wh portable power station. I was able to pack extra clothes, gear, supplies, and electronics inside, while still making sure I had the power I needed to keep them charged. Who is this for:  The Handsfree 2 is great for anyone who takes a lot of electronics into the field, from photographers to reporters to tech junkies. It’s specially designed for camera enthusiasts, with plenty of compartments with removable dividers for lenses and accessories. I also really liked that there are five output options (two USB-A, two USB-C, and a 700W AC outlet) to charge almost anything I needed to juice up in the field, including my laptop, tablet, phones, and gaming handhelds several times over. It's also perfect for tent camping or for a long stint in a cabin that isn't connected to the grid. Anything with a standard, three-prong AC plug can also be powered for a long time, and I was able to keep my camping light and a mini-fridge going for hours. Candles and lanterns are nice, but for me, there’s nothing quite as comforting (or easy to read by) as a proper lamp in the depths of night in the woods. The Handsfree 2 can keep a camping lantern powered for hours, if not days. Pair it with one of Bluetti's 100W solar panels (sold separately, or in a bundle with the Handsfree 2), and you've got unlimited power for camping, outdoor photography or any other off-grid adventures.Who shouldn't buy it:  While it's fantastic for camping, the Handsfree 2 is a bulky, heavy unit, and I didn’t find it suitable for long hiking trips. Even empty, it’ll weigh 16.5 pounds. When fully loaded, you’re looking at anywhere between 45 to 50 pounds on your back. You also won’t be able to pack as much as you expect for a 60L backpack because the power station takes up a lot of space, leaving less room for other essentials. Finally, I didn’t like that the 100W solar panel is a separate purchase and doesn’t come included by default. -Alan Bradley  ... Show more

Best camping grill
Weber Q1200 Gas Grill
Pros
Sturdy and solidly built, yet easy to lug around
Prep shelves come in handy at a campsite
Lights easily and heats evenly
Cons
Heavier than some portable grills we tested
Not light enough for hiking
Why I like it: When testing portable grills, the Weber was superior in almost every category and was a fairly clear winner as not only the best portable gas grill but also the best portable grill for camping. This Weber model is easy to assemble, with just a few parts. The Q1200 is solid and sturdy, even when given a few vigorous shakes. The igniter works well, and once lit, the grill gets hot, reaching its advertised 500 degrees Fahrenheit after just 15 minutes with the lid closed. The flame is easy to control and keeps a consistent temperature throughout cooking with the cast iron grates, even when grilling with the flame turned low. With 189 square inches of cooking surface, it's big enough to cook burgers, chicken, fish, and veggies for a group of six hungry people. It's also nice-looking, with flare-out trays to hold plates and grilling tools and an ergonomic design. Who is this for: Despite its sturdy build, the Q-1200 is still light enough for a grill to take on a camping trip or for one person to carry with relative ease. Like all the grills on the list, it can use any small propane tank sold at most camping or hardware stores.Who shouldn't buy it: While it makes a great grill to feed a campsite, at 30 pounds it’s heavy enough that you won’t want to lug it on a hike or in and out of a raft or canoe. For a lighter, more portable grill, try Coleman’s 5-pound propane camping cooktop.-David Watsky  ...

Best camping generator/power station
Jackery Solar Generator 1000
Pros
The solar panel provides enough power to keep the battery topped up for most of the day with moderate use
The two high-power USB-Cs work great for MacBooks and iPads, charging at a rapid pace rather than a slow trickle
The emergency supercharge can power your battery full to 100% in around an hour, though you shouldn’t use it all the time
Cons
Having the panel and the generator together can take up a lot of space in the trunk of an SUV
Two USB-Cs in 2025 is too few. Everything is powered by USB-C and more is always better
Why I like it:Not all campsites have power, and the ones that do can be more expensive than the more rustic plots. Having your own power that can keep lights, fans, phones and other electronic equipment going while still being isolated helps bring some creature comforts to camping. I love that the solar panel on the Jackery 1000Wh combo can keep the power station charged during the day so you can fully use it at night. We use ours in the center of the tent to charge the family phones, iPads, and to play the projector in the evening. It always has plenty of power for the next day and only needs topping off with some good sun. You can also use the solar panel to charge your phone without using the generator at all if you want to hike a little way from camp. It doesn’t have the same number of outputs as the generator, but it can charge a couple of phones, so you always have some power.Note: This is the review of version one of the Jackery 1000, but the Jackery 2000 Plus is one of our best solar generators and I feel comfortable recommending it over the older 1000 I use. Who is this for:If you love being outside but like to have some creature comforts, then this is a good way to keep them powered. It’s an unobtrusive, no-noise solution that lets you add some modern convenience to your camping experience.Who shouldn't buy it: If you already have power from an RV or camper, you likely won’t need this combo set. You could still pick up a solar panel like the Solar Saga 100 for short trips away from your source of power, but most of your power needs will already be met.-James Bricknell  ... Show more

Best camping cookware
Stanley Wildfare Core 26-Piece Camping Cook Set
Pros
Has all you need to prepare and eat meals at a campsite
Everything packs up neatly inside the 4-quart pot
Weighs less than 5 pounds
Cons
More gear than you’ll need if you typically camp solo or with one other
Why I like it: Stanley makes a number of camping cook sets, but this gives you the most bang for your buck -- 26 pieces in total that all pack up inside the 4-quart stainless steel pot. In addition to the pot, there’s an 8-inch fry pan with lid, strainer, nonslip cutting board, spatula, serving spoon, and table setting -- bowls, plates, and silverware -- for four. The entire unit weighs less than 5 pounds and has all you need to prepare a fireside feast.  It's a good idea to have at least a pot or pan -- preferably both -- for boiling water, if only for your morning camp coffee. For a more modest set, this $25 stainless steel pot with a vented lid is good for cooking small batches of food, and includes two nesting insulated cups to sweeten the deal.Who is this for: Campers who plan to cook their meals from scratch. The stackable plates, bowls, and silverware make roughing it feel a little less rough.Who shouldn't buy it: The larger set is more than you’ll need if you typically camp solo or with just one other person. -David Watsky  ...

Best campsite perimeter lighting
Dream Master Solar Lights
Pros
Easy to set up around the campsite
Solar powered with automatic on-off so they don't require any attention
Inexpensive so not a huge deal if one or two get ruined
Cons
Light could be brighter
Don't work as well in the shade
A timer or multiple colors would be nice
Why I like it: I used to think that a campfire was plenty of light for my campsites, but for the last couple years I've grown to love having these perimeter lights as well. They help define the space for my family and pets, they look cool at night with their warm, inviting pattern and they're ridiculously simple. I just set them up around the edges of my site (or better yet, have the kids do it) and once the sun goes down, their sensors turn on and they light up for as long as we're awake. Sometimes one or two in shaded spots get dim before others, but overall I'm happy with the performance, especially for the price.Who is this for: Perimeter lights are good for campers who like knowing where their space begins and ends at night. Kids playing manhunt or hide and seek may appreciate the extra light and boundaries, and other campers may even like the way it makes your site look (I got the idea from seeing another camper use these). There are plenty of brighter, more obnoxious lights used at campsites, so if you want more light but don't want to flood the darkness with glitter, these fit the bill.Who shouldn't buy it:  If you're a purist who only wants campfire light at night, or in general you prefer a minimal approach to camping, skip these. If you're camping in a buggy area they could attract more of the visitors you don't want. And if you're worried about the lights getting stepped on or ruined you might want to invest more in a sturdier design. These have metal stalks that are solid for the price, but I've broken a couple over the years.-David Katzmaier  ... Show more

Best camping portable firepit
BioLite FirePit+
Pros
The fan assistance keeps the fire hotter for longer
The battery lasts a couple of nights of use
The square shape makes it easy to store and pack for a camping trip, and the carry case makes transport even easier
The addition of the grill top transforms the Biolite into a small grill for cooking burgers and hot dogs
Cons
Having a battery means needing to charge it, so make sure you do that before you leave
While it can use wooden logs, it’s much harder to keep the fire going. Stick with charcoal where possible
Why I like it: I have to squeeze a lot of gear into my SUV when we go camping and the round fire pit we used to take was awkward to fit with all the rectangular totes I pack everything in. (Side note: Pack your camp gear in 27 gallon black totes from Home Depot, it will make your life so much easier, I promise). The rectangular shape and canvas cover (sold separately) make the Biolite easy to transport and pack away when it’s time to leave. I really like using charcoal with this firepit as the battery-assisted fan blows fresh air underneath, keeping the coals white hot and reducing smoke to almost nothing. The battery is supposed to last for 30 hours, but I found it to be closer to 20. It’ll certainly last a couple of nights before needing to recharge it, though.Who is this for: Not all campsites come with a working fire pit, so having your own is always helpful. This is a modern firepit, designed for ease of use and maximum heat within the smallest space, so it’s perfect for you to take just about anywhere. The additional grill top for cooking is another way to save space, as you don’t need to bring a grill and a fire pit; just take the Biolite.Who shouldn't buy it:  If you only have access to wood logs I would think about a different pit. The thin shape of the Biolite makes using wood difficult though not impossible. If you are looking to camp for longer than a few days, you will likely run out of battery. The Biolite still works without it, but it’s not as efficient.-James Bricknell  ... Show more

Best camping coffee maker
AeroPress Go
Pros
Small, light, and easy to carry
Durable, made with non-breakable materials
Simple to operate and easy to clean
Cons
Only makes 8 ounces of coffee at a time
Why I like it: The Aeropress is essentially a French press coffee maker, but more compact and perfect for camping trips. It packs up neatly and is extremely light, so everything you need to make fresh cups of coffee, besides the coffee grounds and hot water, is included. This model uses small filter rounds small enough to fit in a large wallet. To brew with the Aeropress Go, simply load preground coffee into the chamber, add hot water, let it brew for 90 seconds or so, and press. Out comes piping hot espresso-style coffee into an included sipping mug that doubles as a carrying case.The Go is also easy to clean, pop back into place and stuff in your bag, taking up no more space than a small water bottle. The one downside is the meager output. If you prefer to make more than one cup at a time, the Aeropress XL brews double, close to 20 ounces, in the same amount of time.Who is this for: Campers who want hot, espresso-style coffee fast, no matter where they are.Who shouldn't buy it: Camping groups who plan on drinking a lot of coffee -- or those who are fine with instant packets.-David Watsky  ...

Best camping camera
Insta360 X5 Action Camera
Pros
Captures everything all at once
Easy to use
Big image sensors
Cons
Pricey, over $500 when not on sale
More effort to edit than regular action cameras
A little more delicate than a GoPro
Why I like it:I’ve been using and reviewing 360 cameras since they first hit the market a decade ago. Insta360 has been improving their cameras every year and the X5 is the best yet. It has big image sensors to capture a lot of light, user-replaceable lenses in case something goes wrong, and a waterproof body for when things get wet. It can capture up to 8K video and 72 megapixel still images. I’ve used it on a bunch of hikes and adventures, including to Kings Canyon and Death Valley National Parks.Who is this for:Anyone who wants to capture their camping or outdoor adventures in ways that traditional action cameras can’t. Because 360 cameras have 2 back-to-back lenses and sensors, they capture everything in a sphere around the camera. They also edit out the selfie stick, so it looks like you have a drone following you. Later, you can edit the footage to just show the interesting parts. It lets you focus on the moment more, not figuring out where your camera is pointing. Who shouldn't buy it: This camera will be overkill for those who just want to record some moments and share them online right away. If that’s what you’re looking for, a regular action camera will work better. While you can use the X5 as a regular action camera, even just activating one sensor/lens for traditional “flat” photos and videos, if you record in 360 you will need to edit the footage before you post it on social media. Insta360’s elaborate app has a bit of a learning curve, but has all the tools you’ll need to do this editing fairly quickly. Even so, it will take more time than if you’d taken photos/videos with your phone or regular action camera.-Geoffrey Morrison  ... Show more

The best camping air conditioner
Ecoflow Wave 3
Pros
Keeps you cool on the go
Keeps you warm on the go
Optional battery lets you do both off the grid
Cons
Big, heavy and expensive
Requires a bit of setup
Overly optimistic battery life
Why I like it:Ever since I built my campervan I’ve wanted to be able use it during hotter and colder seasons. I bought and installed the EcoFlow Wave 3, which can cool and heat small spaces like my van, but it can also work in a tent or small room. It even has an optional battery so you can do so entirely off the grid. I’ve tested it on campervan road trips to the mountains of Kings Canyon and the deserts of Death Valley National Parks, and so far it has worked great at keeping me warm and cool when I needed it to.Who is this for: If you want to add a bit of portable heating or cooling to a small space, the Wave 3 is roughly the size of a window air conditioner, but designed for portability. If you want to make your tent or van a little more pleasant during cold nights or warm days, it can do that. Who shouldn't buy it: Those who camp during extreme weather conditions. The Wave 3 isn’t cheap and it can’t work miracles. It can add cooling or heating, but in uninsulated spaces like a tent it’s not going to make you perfectly comfortable in extreme cold or hot conditions. It’s also not ideal for those who can’t lift it as it's almost 40 pounds. While it’s relatively small and portable, it’s still quite bulky and with its battery pack, quite heavy. You’ll also need some way to mount/install at least one of the included extendable hoses to vent to the outside. Some setups require two such hoses. So it’s not as easy to use as the images suggest. However, for a cool breeze on your face in the desert, or a warmer tent on a chilly morning, it works surprisingly well.-Geoffrey Morrison  ...

Best camping airbed/mattress
Coleman Airbed Cot
Pros
Queen-sized camping bed, great for couples
Easy to transport by car
Comfortable and supportive
Cons
Expensive ($270)
Sleeps warm (not breathable)
Does not self inflate
Why I like it:The Coleman Airbed Cot combo is great for anyone who wants to elevate their camping experience, literally and figuratively. The cot features an integrated zippered sheet that contains the air bed so you can either use it altogether, or just the air bed by itself, or just the cot by itself. The cot underneath the airbed provides great support and it takes you off the ground which is really nice for colder weather camping and makes you feel more like you’re sleeping at home compared to other camping setups I have tried in the past. Also the design of the cot allows for storage underneath which makes fitting it into a smaller-sized tent easier. The entire thing also comes in a nice carrying case and packs up in a relatively small size which is great for transporting it to a campsite. I slept on this air bed plus cot combination for over a week camping and got great sleep on it.Who is this for: For someone who loves to camp for extended periods of time and wants a sleep setup more like your bed at home should take a look at the Coleman Airbed Cot combo. Who shouldn't buy it: Backpackers won’t get any use out of this bed. It is far too big and heavy. Also if you are planning on having a multi-use air bed that you can use at home and for camping I would look elsewhere because it doesn’t feature a pump that keeps the bed inflated throughout the night. Also, it would be a good idea to double-check the dimensions of your tent to make sure it can fit before buying.-Owen Poole  ...

Best camping pillow
Purple Harmony Anywhere Pillow
Pros
Compact and easy to pack
Breathable mesh cover keeps the pillow cool in hot weather
Great loft that provides support for back, side and stomach sleepers
Doesn’t flatten out like other travel pillows I’ve tried
Cons
Only comes in one firmness and loft
Pricey for a travel pillow
Might be too big for ultra minimalist packers
Why I like it:This is the only travel pillow I’ve tried that actually feels like a pillow and not an uncomfortable neck brace. The Purple Harmony’s latex grid and Talalay combo give it a bouncy, responsive feel that keeps my head properly supported as a side sleeper. I’ve used it everywhere, from camping in upstate New York to flights and even as a lumbar pillow while I work from home.What I like most about this pillow is that it feels like a part of your home bed setup, and not like a traditional travel pillow. I own the full-size Harmony pillow, so having the travel size makes it feel like I’m taking my bed with me while I’m away. I also like that the cover has a moisture-wicking mesh that keeps the pillow cool all night. Even in a stuffy tent, I never felt it get warm. I didn’t expect to love a travel pillow so much, but now it’s part of my road trip setup.Who is this for: This pillow is best for travelers, campers and road trippers who like to have a quality bed setup even when they’re away from home. It’s truly meant for those who want the comfort feel of a real pillow without sacrificing packability.Who shouldn't buy it: This pillow is not for the ultralight packers or anyone needing a super compact or inflatable option that fits in a pocket-sized sack.-Nasha Addarich Martínez  ...

Best camping sunscreen
Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50
Pros
Lightweight and absorbs quickly without a white cast
Water and sweat-resistant for up to 80 minutes
Can be used on your body and face
Subtle, fresh citrusy scent
Doesn’t leave a sticky residue
Non-comedogenic, so it won't clog pores
Cons
Can feel slightly greasy when you overapply
The subtle scent may be too much for people sensitive to smell
Why I like it: I always keep around three bottles of this sunscreen. One in my everyday bag, one in my beach bag (whenever I’m back home in Puerto Rico) and one in my gym bag. It layers well under makeup or on bare skin, and doesn’t sting my eyes when I’m sweating. It has a nice, silky finish that feels more like a light lotion. I’ve worn it on beach runs, hikes, hot and humid days in Puerto Rico, and it holds up well without clogging pores or pilling. The scent is just enough to make you feel fresh, but it fades quickly after applying. Who this is for: This sunscreen is great for active people who want a high-SPF, easy-to-wear sunscreen that won’t melt off on hot or humid days.Who shouldn’t buy it: Anyone looking for a fragrance-free, mineral-only sun-protection formula.-Nasha Addarich Martínez  ...

Best camping app
The Dyrt
Pros
Offers an extensive database of campgrounds with community-sourced information, reviews, tips, photos and more
Displays a ton of helpful details about the campgrounds, including amenities, pricing, directions, contact information and more
User-friendly interface with filtering options to help you easily find what you're looking for
Cons
The pro version of the app is required to access offline maps when you don't have cell service
Doesn't always display real-time availability of the campsites
Information is not always up-to-date, like pricing or campground closures
Why I like it:The Dyrt makes my search for a campsite easy, as I can filter based on my preferences, such as whether it is pet-friendly, if fires are allowed, access to drinking water, etc. The app's interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and I always refer to the helpful reviews and photos added by fellow campers. The app's basic functionalities are available with The Dyrt's free version, which I have been using for over a year without the need to upgrade. Who is this for: The Dyrt app is an excellent resource for anyone interested in camping, whether in state or national parks, RV parks, glamping or free campsites. Even if you don't book directly through the app, the free version is still an easy way to learn about available campgrounds and their offerings, with a detailed list of the features and amenities each provides. It offers straightforward directions for navigating to and accessing the campsites. It even provides the exact coordinates, making it ideal for those who prefer step-by-step instructions and minimal surprises. The Pro version lets you download offline maps -- a handy resource for those venturing into areas with little to no cell reception. Who shouldn't buy it:If you camp infrequently, say only once or twice a year, then paying for the upgraded version of The Dyrt may not be worth it. If you're on a tight budget and don't want to pay for a subscription, other popular camping apps like Hipcamp could be a better option. Hipcamp may also be better if you prefer dispersed camping, as The Dyrt is mainly geared toward designed campgrounds. The Dyrt primarily focuses on sites in the US, so if you're camping in other countries, you'll want to look elsewhere. -Aly Lopez  ... Show more

I have a dependable Subaru that’s excellent for outdoor travels and I couldn’t fit this whole list inside, especially when you add extra-large options like the power station or cooler.I’ve found that including a plastic bin or two for all the smaller items can be an invaluable addition when organizing camping gear. Durable tote bags are also an option, and a bit easier to use then pack away. And anything you can strap safely to your car roof racks can save lots of space (as long as it’s not too heavy to maneuver). When possible, use bungie cords and straps to wrap bundles for your tent, sleeping/bed, blankets, pillows and so on. Incluse several item in each bundle to make carrying easier.If you aren’t sure everything will fit, you can do some quick measuring of your packing -- like a truck bed, trunk, folded-down backset, etc. -- so you have a rough idea of the space you’re working with and what else can fit inside.Read more: Best Outdoor Projector for 2025: Tested by Our Experts Final tips for camping like a pro
Two final important points: Never pile your camping gear so high that you can’t see out of your back window. That’s dangerous and increases the risk of your stack falling apart, too. Also, if you’re using a truck bed I highly recommend keeping a tarp around that can easily fit the truck bed and protect everything inside.To find even more tech answers for your outdoor needs, don’t forget to stop by my guide on the best outdoor security cameras, how to get home security off the grid, our expert-recommended outdoor smart plugs, and the best general outdoor tech we’ve found for every situation.Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.
