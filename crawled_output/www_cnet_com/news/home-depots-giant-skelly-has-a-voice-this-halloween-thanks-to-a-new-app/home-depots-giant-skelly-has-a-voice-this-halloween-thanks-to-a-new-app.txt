Home Depot's Giant Skelly Has a Voice This Halloween Thanks to a New App
Fall has arrived, and spooky season starts now. Check out the latest version of Home Depot's skeleton, which is half the size but has animated features and can talk.

Spooky skeletons are coming to a front yard near you very soon. Home Depot
With the fall equinox on Monday marking the end of summer, it's time to start setting up your Halloween decorations (if you haven't already). And this year, Home Depot's infamous giant skeleton returns with an app that gives the new Ultra Skelly a voice and fresh moves to spook trick-or-treaters.Make no bones about it: Skelly's going high-tech this spooky season. The new animatronic version is shorter than the original, at 6.5 feet tall, but you can freak out your whole neighborhood with this skeleton's rotating upper torso, moving mouth and 18 LCD eye variations (ew).Skelly can now chat with visitors through five preset recordings and up to 30 seconds of custom recording, plus Bluetooth capabilities that let you interact in real time. And you can modulate your voice to make everything sound extra spooky.Skelly was originally launched in 2020, when the pandemic forced people to celebrate Halloween at a distance. Perhaps because of its giant stature -- it's easy to spot, even when social distancing -- the skeleton became a hit and has been resurrected every year since with upgrades and friends. This year, those friends include dragons, trolls, scarecrows and a Skelly Cat (not to be confused with Smelly Cat).You can order Skelly and company now on the Home Depot website or app for $279.
