I'm Just Going to Say It: This Is the Only Correct Way to Cook Bacon
If your smoke alarm doubles as a bacon timer, you desperately need this mess-free oven hack.
David Watsky Senior Editor / Home and Kitchen David lives in Brooklyn where he's spent more than a decade covering all things edible, including meal kit services, food subscriptions, kitchen tools and cooking tips.
David earned his BA from Northeastern and has toiled in nearly every aspect of the food business, including as a line cook in Rhode Island where he once made a steak sandwich for Lamar Odom.
Right now he's likely somewhere stress-testing a blender or tinkering with a toaster. Anything with sesame is his all-time favorite food this week. Expertise Kitchen tools | Appliances | Food science | Subscriptions | Meal kits

Let's be honest, you deserve better than wrestling with a screaming hot pan.
Mike Kemp/Getty Images
With bacon being a pricey treat, there's nothing more disappointing than a batch that's either burnt or flimsy. I've been through it all: the greasy mess of a frying pan, the uneven results from an air fryer and the less-said-the-better outcome from the microwave. Each method was a letdown, leaving me with a mess and subpar bacon.It turns out the secret to perfect bacon was right there all along: the oven.
This story is part of
12 Days of Tips, helping you make the most of your tech, home and health during the holiday season.
After testing every cooking method imaginable, baking is the clear winner for making consistently crispy bacon with almost no effort. You get evenly cooked strips every single time, and you can finally say goodbye to hot grease splattering all over your stovetop. If you're ready to stop fighting with your frying pan, this is the foolproof method you need to try.Best Meat Delivery Services for 2025

Below, you'll find the simple steps needed to cook perfect bacon in the oven. When it's done, I've outlined nine genius ways to use leftover bacon fat.How to cook perfect bacon in the oven
It's fine if the bacon touches, as long as it's not overlapping.  Hana Asbrink/CNETHere are my tips for cooking perfectly crisp bacon in the oven. Spoiler alert: There aren't many steps, and none of them take very long.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. I would avoid air fryer mode if your oven has it since the fast-moving air is more likely to blow grease around the inside. We're aiming for a mess-free scenario. Line a baking tray with aluminum foil, or use a nonstick sheet pan for a more eco-friendly approach. If you're going the foil route, make sure the edges ride up the sides of the tray so the grease doesn't spill over the sides and down onto the tray. If you're using nonstick bakeware, I prefer a ceramic sheet pan or tray but Teflon works well, too.Read more: Nonstick Cookware Guide: Teflon, Ceramic and More ExplainedArrange bacon on the tray. The strips shouldn't overlap, but it's fine if they touch since they'll shrink down significantly while cooking. If you prefer super crispy bacon with a bit less grease, you can arrange the slices on a wire rack above the tray for the fat to drip down below.Cook for 8 to 10 minutes. Be sure to keep one eye on the bacon as some ovens run hotter than others. If you like your bacon crispy and well done, give it another few minutes. Remember, bacon does a lot of its crisping after it comes out and cools. Read more: Make Your Next Burger in an Air Fryer and Thank Me Later
Oven bacon is as good as it gets. Hana Asbrink/CNETDrain the bacon on a sheet or two of paper towels. After a few minutes, you're ready to serve those crispy strips with eggs, in a BLT or crumbled to fancy up boxed mac and cheese. The best part? After cooking bacon in the oven, all you're left with is a small ball of foil to heave effortlessly into the trash.Best Toaster Ovens for 2025

A few countertop ovens for cooking baconFor bacon, I love using a smaller countertop convection model. A large oven works just as well but takes longer to preheat and, dang it, we want bacon now. The Ninja Double Oven and Breville's Smart Oven Air are two multifunction ovens that work well. Both are large enough that bacon grease won't splatter on the ceiling, but are small and powerful enough to preheat quickly and cook bacon to a crisp in under 10 minutes. (We've also got tips for how to clean your cast iron skillet and how to make boxed mac and cheese taste so much better.) Can you make bacon in an air fryer?
An air fryer is another cleaner tool for making bacon. Getty ImagesAbsolutely. Easy air fryers are perfect for making bacon in a very similar manner to oven bacon. Here's a step-by-step guide to making bacon in an air fryer. FAQs
Why should I avoid the oven's air fryer mode when cooking bacon?
In order to air fry the bacon in the oven, a lot of hot air moves very quickly through where the meat is cooking. While this wouldn't normally be a problem, bacon is greasy (it's part of the reason we're avoiding cooking it over the stovetop in the first place). The fast-moving air produced in air fryer mode is a good way to spatter that grease all over the place inside your oven.
How long should I cook my bacon in the oven?
You should cook your bacon for 8 to 10 minutes for best results, but if you want the crispiest bacon, you could leave your strips in for a couple more minutes.
