According to recent data, Apple still has the highest global market share for tablets, and all its iPads are among the best tablets, including the entry-level 11th-gen iPad and iPad Air M3, both of which were released in 2025 (the newish 7th-gen iPad Mini was released in late 2024).
But there are plenty of other quality tablets I've tested, including several appealing Android tablets featured on this list. I've also selected some affordable budget tablets, which are good for consuming media or playing casual games but don't quite qualify as a professional productivity tool or true laptop replacement.

What's the best tablet overall?I have Apple's iPad (11th-gen, 2025) at the top of the list because it's the overall best tablet value for most people, particularly now that the base model comes with 128GB of storage (instead of 64GB) and sometimes gets discounted to as low $299. We also like the iPad Air M3 for those who want a more powerful tablet from Apple but aren't ready to shell out even bigger bucks for an iPad Pro model.
As for Android tablets, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is our current top pick. It's expensive but can often be had at a nice discount when you trade in a device with Samsung.
What we updated: June 2025We added the OnePlus Pad 3 and Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 to the list.Best tablets of 2025

SCORE
Pros
Affordable
128GB storage included on base model
Solid front video camera
More powerful A16 processor
Cons
No support for Apple Intelligence
Won't work with newer Pencil Pro or Pencil 2 stylus
Accessories still too expensive
A lot of the time, just going with the basics is best. That's certainly the case with the Apple iPad.Why I like itApple has finally updated its entry-level iPad. While it only got the Apple A16 chip found in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15, not one of Apple's more powerful M-Series chips -- that's a performance bump from the A14 processor in the 10th-gen iPad. Just as importantly, the base version of the iPad 11th-gen comes with 128GB of storage instead of 64GB (hallelujah!).Who's it forThe 11th-gen iPad remains arguably the best value, especially when it is discounted to less than $300. It's best as a media consumption tablet, but it can also be used for basic content creation, education, simple home office tasks and FaceTime chats.Who should skip itAlas, this new basic iPad doesn't get you Apple Intelligence (the chip doesn't support it), and it still works only with the simple USB-C Pencil or the first-gen Pencil (with a USB-C-to-Lightning adapter), not the Pencil Pro. If those are must-haves, you'll need to move up to an Air or Pro model.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Upgraded M3 processor
Price hasn't increased
New, less expensive Magic Keyboard option
Cons
Lacks faster refresh rate display of Pro line
Still doesn't have OLED screen
Configs can get expensive fast
CNET reviewer Scott Stein has this to say about the iPad Air M3, which was released in 2025 and is equipped with an upgraded M3 processor: "A year ago, I called the iPad Air 'the iPad Pro you should buy.' So, obviously, my feelings remain unchanged with the Air getting a performance bump with the M3 chip.Why I like itAs nice as the fancier M4 iPad Pro might be, spending an extra $400 for it now that it's also a year old seems like a lot to ask (though if you're considering the 13-inch iPad Air, you might be better off moving up to the Pro). I'd consider the 11-inch model instead, and at the right config, this could very well be the futureproofed, more affordable iPad that's perfect for you -- especially if you're interested in pushing the iPad hard for tools that will need the M3 performance. Plus, there's a new-and-improved keyboard for it.Who's it forIt's a versatile tablet, just like the basic iPad, but with better performance. If you'd like to use a Pencil Pro and plan to power-use either AI or graphics features on the iPad, then the Air is your budget pick. Who should skip itThe iPad Pro offers a high-contrast HDR custom OLED display, a thinner design, a Face ID camera and Lidar on the back, though those features come at a price jump of $400. Still, if those features are important to you, you don't want an Air. Similarly, you don't need the Air's M3 chip for basics like streaming video and audio, playing less graphically demanding games and using thousands of apps.

Best premium Android tablet
Samsung Galaxy Tab S10
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Sleek, slim design
Impressive AMOLED display and performance
S-Pen included
Memory expansion slot
New AI features
Cons
Pricey
Essentially, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 is the Android equivalent of Apple's iPad Pro line. There's a 12.4-inch Plus model and the S10 Ultra, which has a gigantic 14.6-inch display that's a little too large for my tablet tastes. These are premium, powerful tablets -- and both include Samsung’s S Pen.Why I like itSamsung knows how to make elegant mobile devices, and the Galaxy Tab line is no exception. The AMOLED displays are exactly the same as the previous models, except they’re now equipped with anti-reflective technology that helps reduce glare. Otherwise, the displays have the same pixel density with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. The S10 Ultra has a 2,960x1,848-pixel resolution, while the S10 Plus is 2,800x1,752 pixels. Samsung also moved from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor to a MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus processor. The new chip gives the Ultra an 18% bump in CPU speed, a 28% increase in GPU power and a 14% increase in NPU speeds (the neural processing unit is what helps drive the tablet’s AI features) compared to the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra’s processor. The speed gains are slightly less for the S10 Plus.It's certainly pricey, but Samsung offers some decent trade-in deals, especially as we approach the arrival of the next-gen Galaxy Tab S11. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus (or Tab S10 Ultra if you'd like to go big) remains the best Android tablet available. Who's it forThis is a versatile, high-performance tablet for non Apple users that's not only a good productivity tool but an impressive entertainment device that also works well for Cloud gaming. With the keyboard accessory, it's also a potential laptop replacement.Who should skip itIt's overkill for those looking for a tablet to primarily use as a device to consume content.  ... Show more

iPadOS limits this computer's potential
CNET Reviewer Scott Stein says that if money were no object, Apple’s M4 iPad Pros would clearly be the best iPads for anyone. Read CNET's iPad Pro (2024) review.Why I like itNot only are Apple’s M4 iPad Pros incredibly fast with new M4 processors, they have vivid OLED displays with excellent contrast and brightness, as well as improved Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard accessories (still sold separately). The M4 chip works with Apple Intelligence, Apple's set of AI features, and the M4 has plenty of power to last for years of OS updates to come. The Pro is a thinner tablet too.Who's it forAnyone who craves the best Apple tablet for creating and entertainment -- and doesn’t care about a budget -- this is your pick.Who should skip itThe downside to the iPad Pro is its price: it starts at $999 for the 11-inch model or $1,299 for the 13-inch model. That's outside a lot of people's budgets for a tablet.

Best new high performance Android tablet
OnePlus Pad 3
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Slim, elegant design
Impressively zippy overall performance from top-of-the-line Snapdragon Elite processor
Sharp, bright display with 144Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and gaming
Good battery life
OnePlus tends to offer bundle deal on keyboard case accessory
Cons
Fairly premium price
LCD instead of OLED display
No microSD card slot for expandable storage
Disappointing front camera
Despite a few small shortcomings, the OnePlus Pad 3 is one of the best premium Android tablets. It certainly makes for an excellent entertainment device, offering strong performance for gaming (it's also well-suited for Xbox Cloud Gaming). Plus, it can handle light productivity. Why I like itLast year's OnePlus Pad 2 was considered one of the better tablet values, combining premium performance with a midrange price: $550, which would sometimes dip to $500. To a certain degree, the new-for-2025 OnePlus Pad 3 follows the same playbook. Equipped with a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and a bright, 13.2-inch, 3.4 K-resolution display with 315ppi pixel density and an adaptive refresh rate up to 144Hz, this is a high performance Android tablet that gives off premium vibes for a lower price than Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. The OnePlus Pad 3 puts up impressive performance numbers across benchmarks, with especially strong results from the GPU. It's available for preorder now, with a choice of two "free gift" accessories as an incentive to purchase, and it ships July 8. Read full review.Who should skip itFolks looking for a premium Android tablet at more of a midrange price. At $700, the Pad 3 costs $150 more than the Pad 2, edging it into premium pricing territory that's outside some people's tablet budgets. It's also not quite a laptop replacement if you're looking for that in a tablet.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
iPad-like feel with smooth aluminum case
Sharp 10.95-inch display
Relatively zippy processor
Included speaker dock sounds great
Good front video camera
Cons
Price ramps up for cases and more storage
No keyboard or stylus case options
Although the Google Pixel Tablet has been out for a while, it remains a good value as a midrange tablet, particularly for folks who've already bought into the Google device ecosystem.Why I like itGoogle's versatile, dockable Pixel Tablet doubles as a home hub and a speaker dock-enabled assistant, and its multitasking features work great. You'll have to find your own stylus and keyboard options, but Google has otherwise served up a good family iPad alternative for anyone in the Android ecosystem. Google's currently offering the tablet for $299 without the dock now, but that dock is one of our favorite parts of the tablet. Who's it forThe Pixel Tablet is one of our favorite family tablets. The dock keeps it in a central location, like a kitchen or living room, so it's always handy for sharing. A relatively zippy Google Tensor G2 processor, a good front camera for video chats, a crisp display (16:10 aspect ratio) and a clean Google Android software experience all add to the appeal. Who should skip itIf you're looking for a little zippier, better-performing tablet, there are better midrange options, though they cost a little more.

Premium Android tablet with a midrange price
OnePlus Pad 2
8.2
/10
SCORE
OnePlus is known for producing solid-performing devices at a reasonable price. The midrange OnePlus Pad 2 delivers good bang for the buck.
Why I like itCompared to the original OnePlus' Pad tablet, which remains on sale, the Pad 2 has a larger, brighter display (it's an IPS LCD, not OLED) that's a tad sharper. It's also equipped with an upgraded Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which offers a bump in performance from the Mediatek Dimension 9000 processor found in the Pad (it's not a huge performance bump, but a bump, nonetheless).With its strong performance and excellent display -- it's one of the few Android tablets with a 7:5 aspect ratio -- the OnePlus Pad 2 feels like a premium tablet but has more of a midrange price, so it's a good value. We also like that OnePlus throws in its Folio Case 2 or Stylus 2 for free when you buy it directly from OnePlus. A smart keyboard case is available for around $120.Who's it forSomeone who can't quite afford Samsung's flagship tablet but wants similar performance for less money. Who should skip itWith its 7:5 aspect ratio, the OnePlus Pad 2 looks more like an iPad than most Android tablets. Some people prefer the 16:10 aspect ratios of most Android tablets. You can also get better trade-in values for Samsung tablets (especially if you're trading in for a new Samsung model).

Very good value when discounted

Cons

Amazon keeps updating its Fire HD 10 tablet every couple of years, bumping its processor speed and RAM. It delivers acceptable performance at a very affordable price. Why I like itIn 2023, Amazon introduced a slightly lighter and 25% faster Fire HD 10. It comes in a few different versions, including a standard version with a list price of $140 with 32GB of storage, along with the Fire HD 10 Kids (intended for children aged 3 to 7) and Fire HD 10 Kids Pro (targeted at 6- to 12-year-olds). Aside from its larger 10.1-inch display compared to the Fire HD's 8-inch display, this model's screen is sharper, with a pixel density of 224 pixels per inch, which is the best for any Amazon tablet, including the flagship Fire 11 Max.The non-Pro model has a Disney theme option. As with all Fire Kids tablets, these are bundled with padded cases, a 12-month subscription to the Amazon Kids Plus service, which offers kid-friendly apps and content, and an included two-year free replacement policy should the tablet get damaged. Battery life is rated at up to 13 hours. Who's it forWhen it goes on sale, the Fire HD 10 is arguably the best budget tablet value, and it often is. It's a great option for media consumption and online shopping, naturally. Who should skip itWhile the Fire HD 10's screen offers 1080p resolution, if you're looking for a tablet with a very sharp display, the entry-level iPad is a better bet. This also isn't a good choice for content creation.

CNET's iPad reviewer Scott Stein was pretty pleased with the updates to the latest generation iPad Mini, though its high price remains a concern.Why I like itI've always liked the iPad Mini because it's smaller and lighter than the entry-level iPad and more travel-friendly (yes, the screen is smaller, but it's still decent for watching videos and reading). It has a newer A17 Pro chip that supports Apple Intelligence, it works with the Pencil Pro stylus, and now comes with 128GB of storage in its base $499 model (instead of 64GB). The Mini hasn't changed its basic looks, although this tablet got a total facelift in 2021. Who's it forIt's a great, small but powerful tablet. It'll work well for everything from content creation and notetaking to streaming video, reading and gaming. Who should skip itThe iPad Mini just seems a little overpriced for what it is. Yes, the A17 Pro processor is better than what you get with the entry-level iPad A16 chip, but it's not the M3 processor that powers the iPad Air and allows you to run extra apps on an external monitor like M-series iPads can.  ...

Read review.Why I like itJason Cockerham, who reviewed this tablet for CNET, says that at 8.8 inches diagonal, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is larger than the best large phones but still smaller than most tablets made for entertainment. "You might not expect it to be great for gaming, but the more I used it, the more I realized it's nearly the perfect size.

Isn't as zippy as standard Tab S10 (Exynos 1580 chip is more than adequate for most people but a bit middling)
If you can't afford Samsung's flagship Galaxy Tab S10 tablets, the company's step-down Galaxy Tab FE tablets are a value alternative. Why I like itEvery year, Samsung comes out with "Fan Edition" versions of its flagship Galaxy Tab S series tablets that aren't quite as powerful and have less-advanced display technology -- but cost a lot less. Once again, that's true for the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus, which start at $500 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While the Galaxy Tab S10 FE retains the same 10.9-inch display of its predecessor, the larger Tab S10 FE Plus ($650) is equipped with a 13.1-inch display, which is larger than the 12.4-inch screen found in its predecessor and the standard Tab S10 Plus.Both new tablets run on an upgraded Samsung Exynos 1580 chipset instead of the more powerful MediaTek processors found in their standard counterparts (the Exynos 1380 chipset powers the Galaxy Tab S9 FE tablets). In our benchmarks, I can't say the Exynos 1580 offered blazingly fast performance (it was a tad middling, especially compared to the M3 chip in the latest Apple iPad Air), but the tablet's overall performance should be more than adequate for most folks and the LCD screen is bright and crisp with good color saturation (no, it's not quite as good as the AMOLED display on the standard Tab S10 Plus but I still liked it). Samsung says the Tab S10 FE is 4% lighter than its predecessor, and both tablets are equipped with a newly upgraded 13-megapixel high-resolution rear camera, though the Tab S10 FE Plus no longer has a second ultrawide camera.Who's it forWhile the Tab S10 FE screen sizes don't correlate to the standard Tab S10 Plus and Ultra screen sizes, the bottom line is that you're getting about 75% of the tablet that you get with the standard Tab S10 series for significantly less money. And if you have an older Samsung tablet to trade in, the price becomes even more affordable.Who should skip itSome argue that it's better to get a deal on last year's flagship Galaxy Tab S9 than to buy a Galaxy Tab FE 10, which is fairly zippy but isn't going to blow you away with its performance. There's some truth to that.

Pros
Fairly affordable
Decent display and performance
Great sound from integrated JBL speakers

Cons
Tablet is thicker than a lot of tablets
Lenovo bills its Android-based Tab Plus as a "premium entertainment tablet," it mostly lives up to that description though we could debate how premium it really is.Why I like itWhile Tab Plus' MediaTek Helio G99 processor delivers pretty middle-of-the-road performance, it was zippy enough. Its 11.5-inch 2K LCD (2,000x1,200 pixels) essentially provides 1080p resolution, though its 90Hz refresh rate helps create a smoother image and overall, the display seems like a small step-up from the screens you get with many budget Android tablets. All that said, the Tab Plus' standout feature is its sound. Equipped with JBL speakers, this tablet produces bigger -- and better -- sound than most of the tablets I've tested.The built-in speakers add some girth to the tablet, which also has a retractable kickstand, so it's a bit chunky. Battery life is solid at around 12 hours, and I appreciate the included carrying case. The case is a little cheap-looking and feeling, but it is protective.Who's it forWith its built-in kickstand and higher-grade JBL speakers, the Tab Plus is appealing for consuming media on the go. It's also a decent value, especially when discounted.Who should skip itIf you're looking for a little svelter, sleeker tablet with more premium performance, this may not be for you.

Amazon continues to make the best inexpensive tablets for media consumption. The Fire HD 8 is the middle of the lineup, hitting a sweet spot for price and performance.Why I likeThe biggest reason to like the Fire HD 8 is its price.

One of our biggest complaints about the iPad Pro is that it still runs on iPadOS instead of MacOS. The Surface Pro, on the other hand, is a full Windows PC in a slim, powerful tablet.Why I like itTwo items help make the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 my favorite two-in-one detachable Windows tablet: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Elite X processor and an excellent OLED display (a more affordable version of the Surface Pro 11 is available with an LCD). The Arm-based CPU delivers competitive performance and far fewer compatibility issues for mainstream use than previous Windows-on-Arm efforts. And it helps the Surface Pro 11 deliver a long battery life. The 13-inch OLED display supplies a crisp 2.8K resolution along with P3 calibration and real HDR capability. It's the best Surface Pro I’ve seen in a while.Who's it forWhile the Surface Pro is primarily made for commercial use, the devices are well-suited for those who want or need a tablet that can run full versions of Windows software. Its versatile design is perfect for travel or desk use, connected up to a full-size monitor, keyboard and mouse. Who should skip itIf you're looking to run iPadOS or Android apps, this won't do that.

Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE: The two models in the line look and feel a lot like the slightly more premium standard Galaxy Tab S10 models, which are powered by a more powerful processor and feature AMOLED displays with 120Hz refresh rates instead of LCD screens with 90Hz rates. But the Galaxy Tab S10 FE models cost significantly less. They include an S Pen and are good tablets for those who like to draw or take handwritten notes that can later be converted to text.
How we test tablets
Tablets are, effectively, computers. We benchmark tablets against common performance and graphics metrics and run battery life tests for video playback. But we also look at what tablets can do that make them personal or fun. Playing games, trying out art apps, having video chats, watching movies and exploring how well multitasking works all factor in. Benchmarks are only one small part of the review story.CNET also looks at our deep collective history and experience with tablets and computers in general. Our editors have decades of knowledge across Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon ecosystems, and we look at the value and performance of tablets against what laptops and other PCs can provide too. Factors to consider when buying a tablet
Tablets are portable computers that have great usability while being less complicated than a traditional computer. The best tablet is the one that's versatile enough for all kinds of use cases from home, school or work. While finding the best tablet for you isn't hard, knowing where to start can be overwhelming, and that's where CNET's testing and reviews can help. We've picked out the best of the best, and these tablets can do it all, including checking email, managing finances, testing your art skills or casually browsing YouTube and watching videos. Price, in that regard, is a huge factor. Most people we know consider tablets a secondary computer purchase or as a device for kids. Value matters for tablets more than maybe any other product category for that reason. Some tablets are more premium, which may be worth it if you value a more future-proof device, better OLED displays or faster chips.You can't discuss tablets without talking about Apple. The iPad Pro and Air models just got big hardware upgrades, with the expensive Pro introducing OLED displays and a new M4 chip for the first time, along with an improved Pencil Pro. But keep in mind that Apple devices have their own app ecosystem and lean on Apple services. iPads are more versatile than ever, but they're still not the same, app or OS-wise, as Macs.While the iPad is the king of the segment, Android tablets have made a comeback over the last couple of years. The Google Pixel Tablet and One Plus Pad 2 are excellent midrange options that are good for family or home use (Pixel Tablet) or as a personal mini laptop (OnePlus Pad 2). Meanwhile, Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 tablets" target="_self, which feature a slim design and excellent AMOLED displays, are a top premium Android tablet option.
In the value segment, Amazon's Fire tablets are still the best tablet option for cheap and kid-friendly models. If you're looking for something good for productivity and entertainment, an affordable Chromebook blurs the line between a laptop and a tablet.  Tablet FAQs
What's the difference between Apple's iPads?
For the most part, Apple's iPads differ in terms of price, display quality and chip performance. Higher-end models also work with different Apple Pencil Pro styluses. All iPads run iPadOS similarly, and they all are capable of multitasking. All current models have USB-C ports too. The entry-level iPad is our versatile top pick, but the Air and Pro models add M-series chips that can add more multitasking with connected monitors and work with a few pro-level Apple apps. The new Pro iPads add even faster M4 chips, step-up OLED displays with better brightness and contrast and refresh rates, and are a bit thinner and lighter. If you care about Apple's Pencil stylus, the Air and Pro work with a new Pencil Pro that adds rotational and squeeze gestures. However, they're not compatible with the older Pencil 2.

Which tablet operating system is best? Fire OS, iPadOS, Android or Windows?
Apple's iPadOS is arguably the best for a few reasons. For starters, its user interface is clean and easy to use, it has strong security features and it plays well with other devices in Apple's ecosystem, including iPhones that run iOS, Macs than run MacOS, Watches that run WatchOS and Apple TV streamers that run tvOS. That's obviously a big plus for Apple users. You can also expect that the iPad you buy gets several years of iPadOS updates and there are thousands of iPadOS apps.The same is true to a certain degree for Android tablets, but the Android market is more fragmented and many Android tablets have their own slightly different user interfaces thanks to tablet manufacturers mixing in their own OS overlays (for example, OneUI in the case of Samsung and the OxygenOS in the case of OnePlus). Also, the Android tablet you buy will likely only get three years of guaranteed Android OS updates (even Google's own Pixel Tablet only promises three years), so it feels a little less future proof.While Amazon's FireOS runs on top of an Android base, there's no access to the Google Play Store (yes, there are hacks to add it, but that's another story), which is a bit of a problem. That said, Amazon does offer a lot of "free" content if you're an Amazon Prime member, so there are benefits to playing in Amazon's walled garden -- and Fire OS tablets are very affordable.As for Windows tablets, the big plus is that they are full-fledged Windows computers and give you full access to Windows apps.

How much money should I expect to spend on a tablet?
You can pay as little as $50 for Amazon's entry-level Fire 7 tablet or over $1,000 for a large premium tablet like Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra or Apple's iPad Pro 13-inch. Midrange tablets like Apple's entry-level iPad, the iPad Mini, iPad Air M3 and Samsung Galaxy S10 FE range from around $300-$600. Naturally, when a new model comes out, previous versions tend to get discounted, sometimes nicely.

How to choose buying a tablet vs. buying a laptop
Many premium tablets can now serve as laptop replacements, especially when you add a keyboard accessory, so it's become more tempting to buy a tablet instead of a laptop, especially because they tend to be lighter and more travel-friendly. But if you're just trying to choose between one or the other, it really comes down to how you intend to use the device and whether you can live with some possible limitations. The nice thing about a Windows tablet is that it's a full-fledged Windows computer -- it just has a touchscreen. Alas, some iPads are certainly capable of running MacOS and could be even more MacBook-like, but they only run Apple's iPadOS and iPad apps. Editor Scott Stein has always wished Apple would marry iPadOS with MacOS, but it's yet to happen.

What's the best time to buy a tablet?
Unlike phones, tablets arrive at random times of the year. Apple releases iPads erratically, although entry-level models tend to come in March or April. Samsung usually has new tablets in August, with ongoing discounts and trade-in options to help bring the final price down. Holiday sales and Amazon Prime Day sales are always worth waiting for, but remember that many sales tend to spring up again and again.
