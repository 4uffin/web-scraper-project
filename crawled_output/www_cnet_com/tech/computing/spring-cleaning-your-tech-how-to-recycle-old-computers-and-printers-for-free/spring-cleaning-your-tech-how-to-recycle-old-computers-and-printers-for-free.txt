Here are the best places to take your PCs and old tech for responsible disposal. Johner Royalty Free/Getty Images
When an old laptop or printer finally gives out, the biggest question is often, "What do I do with it now?" Tossing electronics in the trash is bad for the environment and can even be illegal. It's no wonder a recent CNET survey found that nearly a third of us have old, unused tech just sitting in our closets and basements.The good news is that recycling your e-waste is simpler than you might think. You don't have to hunt down a special facility; major retailers like Best Buy and Staples make it incredibly convenient. Most will take old laptops, printers, and other computer accessories off your hands for free. Plus, some stores even offer trade-in programs that can get you a gift card or a discount on new gear, making it a win-win for both you and the planet.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.
Clearing out your unused tech not only frees up space in your home, but also keeps harmful components out of landfills. So if you've been holding onto gear you haven't used in years, now's the time to let it go the right way. Here's what you need to know about recycling your old tech. For more, learn how to recycle your old phones.
What to do before recycling an old computer
Wherever you choose to take or mail in your items to be recycled, you'll want to protect your data by removing it as best you can. One way to do this is to perform a factory reset on your computer. Our guide walks you through the process.
Where to recycle old computers and printers Some retail stores will accept computers and printers for recycling, but it's not always a free service. Policies vary by company.
Apple Store You can recycle your old Apple computers, monitors and peripherals, such as printers, for free at an Apple store, but there's a costly catch. According to the Apple Free Recycling program, you must also purchase a qualifying Apple computer or monitor to receive this service. Need another option? A third-party company called Gazelle buys old MacBooks to recycle them. After accepting Gazelle's offer, you print a prepaid label or request a prepaid box and ship the machine to them.

Best Buy stores Best Buy generally accepts up to three household items per household per day to be recycled for free, including desktop computers and printers, as well as other items ranging from e-readers to vacuum cleaners. While three is the limit for most items, there's a higher limit for laptops -- Best Buy will take five of those per household per day. Note that rules for dropping off monitors vary by state, and it's not always free to do so. Best Buy also offers a mail-in recycling service for select items, but that's also not free. A small box that holds up to 6 pounds costs $23, while a large box (up to 15 pounds) costs $30.
Office Depot stores Office Depot and OfficeMax merged in 2013. The retailers offer a tech trade-in program both in-store and online where you may be able to get a store gift card in exchange for your old computers and printers. If the device has no trade-in value, the company will recycle it for free. Office Depot also sells its own tech recycling boxes that you can fill with electronics to be recycled and then drop off at the stores, but they aren't free. The small boxes cost $8.39 and hold up to 20 pounds, the medium ones cost $18.29 and hold up to 40 pounds, and the large boxes cost $28 and hold up to 60 pounds.
Staples stores You can bring your old desktop computers, laptops, printers and more to the Staples checkout counter to be recycled for free, even if they weren't purchased there. The retailer also has a free at-home battery recycling box which, according to a Staples rep, has led customers to recycle thousands of batteries per week, up from an earlier average of 50 per week. Here's a list of everything that can be recycled at Staples.

Where to find an electronics recycling center If you don't live near a major retailer or would rather take your computers and printers to a recycling center, you can locate places near you by using search tools provided by Earth911 and the Consumer Technology Association.
Earth911 recycling center Use the recycling center search function on Earth911 to find recycling centers near your ZIP code that accept laptops, desktops and printers. Note that the results may also turn up places that accept mobile phones and not computers or printers, so you may have to do a little filtering.
Greener Gadgets recycling center Consult the Consumer Technology Association's Greener Gadgets Recycle Locator to find local recycling centers in your area that will take old items. The search function also allows you to filter the results to separately hunt for places that take computers versus printers.
