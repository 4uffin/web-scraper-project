Best Gaming PC for 2025
From budget options to not-so-cheap and beyond, our expert-tested picks for the best gaming PCs available in 2025.

Article updated on August 25, 2025 at 11:18 AM PDT
Lori Grunin Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras. I've also volunteered with a cat rescue for over 15 years doing adoptions, designing marketing materials, managing volunteers and, of course, photographing cats.

How we test
Factors to consider when buying a gaming PC
Size
If you want high-powered components or a motherboard with more than just a slot for a graphics card, you need a midtower or full tower case; if you don't plan on upgrading and can afford to pay for the configuration you're going to still want in three to five years, then you can go with a small form factor, or SFF, PC
Motherboard
You generally only can choose the motherboard for custom or DIY builds. The motherboard and its chipset determines the maximum possible USB ports; networking types; type and maximum amount of memory; maximum amount and type of SSD and more.
Operating system
Windows. You can certainly play games on MacOS or Linux, but far more games are developed for and supported on Windows.
Processor
Games that spawn and calculate the movements of a lot of objects or characters -- complex simulations and RTS, for example -- may lean heavily on it, but many games don't need as much power as a creator system.
Graphics
The GPU power determines render speed. The higher the resolution and use of technologies (such as raytracing or AI-based upscaling) without sacrificing frame rates, the more power and video memory (VRAM) you need.
System memory
I don't recommend any system with 8GB RAM or less -- 16GB should be your absolute minimum and many games already require that much -- but 32GB is a good bet to support games for at least another few years.
Storage
Games are getting bigger and bigger, so more storage is always better; I like at least 1TB.

Gaming desktops still play second fiddle to gaming laptops for most people, but PCs have a place in the hearts of those who want power and upgradability for now and the future. PC configurations change a lot more frequently, though, and it's hard to keep up with testing and reviews, so our current gaming PC recommendations may include previous configurations that we've reviewed. We also include configuration suggestions that we haven't specifically tested but are based on our experience with similar components.  Our Picks

What's the best gaming PC overall?Our pick for the best gaming desktop is the Lenovo Legion Tower 7i, thanks to its solid performance up through 4K, without costing as much as you'd usually spend. It's got some flaws -- you can't overclock the memory and it's a little light on the dust filtering -- but for a prebuilt model costing $2,220 (at the time of writing this) it's a nice balance.The Best Gaming PCs

SCORE
Pros
Great 1080p and 4K performance
Looks good, and has abundant RGB lighting
Operates quietly without throttling
Cons
We'd like more USB-C ports
Limited dust filtration
Delivering good performance and 4K gaming without a sky-high price, Lenovo's midrange Legion T7i runs quietly at top speeds and looks stylish while doing so -- even without jumping to the more recent RTX 50-class GPUs. But even in 2024 we'd have expected more than one USB-C port, especially since lots of gaming accessories have been switching over, and some better dust filtering would be welcome.It's a decent gaming system and configuration that should last you a while, and there's a cheaper configuration with an RTX 4070 Ti that might also serve you well if you're looking for something reasonable from a major manufacturer.  ...

Velocity Micro Raptor Z95A
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent gaming performance
Tidy interior
Ample upgrade options
Cons
Considerably more expensive than DIY
So-so front connections
Our top gaming system recommendation will probably always be from a custom builder, simply because a top-end gaming PC will have a lot of upgrade options and an upgrade-friendly design, in addition to excellent performance. Even most ready-to-ship systems from custom builders have great upgradability because they're built from off-the-shelf parts. Velocity Micro is an almost 30-year veteran in the business, and while it doesn't create the glitziest gaming systems -- for that, you want builders like Maingear, Origin PC, iBuyPower and the like -- it knows how to build a top-flight gaming performer. The Raptor Z95A we tested uses some of the fastest components available (the "A" is for AMD, and there's a Z95 built around Intel CPUs) and has a clean internal layout for easy fiddling and sleek appearance.The downside: You pay for it, since they're generally more expensive compared to prebuilt PCs from the big players or building one from scratch yourself. We also aren't terribly thrilled by the dearth of front connections -- a common and frustrating issue for many desktops, and extra disappointing given the size of the PC. You can frequently compensate by using a hub for connections that aren't latency sensitive, if necessary.With enough power for your most demanding games and graphics-heavy generative AI, this Velocity Micro system has our stamp of approval. If you need something with more oomph for CPU-intensive games or AI, you should bump up to a Ryzen 9 or Intel Core Ultra 9 class of processor.  ... Show more

Best gaming PC with a novel design
Alienware Aurora R16
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Slick and fairly compact design
Largely quiet even under load
Tool-free access and parts abound
Nice set of connections
Cons
Performance not up to what we expect for the money
Custom components and layout means upgrades may be a problem
Case design has the potential to suck in dust
Alienware drew a little further away from its roots in 2024, redesigning its Aurora desktop to look novel and stylish but not as out-of-this-world as it was. That allowed the company to shrink its overlarge footprint as well as introducing tool-free access and parts to what's still a fast and quiet system.But it's still relatively expensive for its configuration -- and that's before tariffs factor in whenever you decide to buy -- with a quirky, proprietary layout that may make upgrades more expensive or awkward than they might be in other systems. And the new design has unfiltered intakes, which our reviewer thinks might require above-average vigilance for you to keep under control.Though Alienware has repositioned the Aurora as its "entry" line, you still don't go to Alienware looking for bargains; it's an entry to Alienware, and you should expect to pay a little more to get its novel looks, but it's not a great choice if you want to tinker a lot or live in a dusty environment.The model we tested has subsequently been refreshed with Core Ultra CPUs and RTX 50-series GPUs and renamed simply "Aurora." I recommend the $2,150 Core Ultra 9 285, RTX 5060 Ti configuration, which is comparably priced and should deliver equivalent performance.

Best midrange gaming PC
HP Omen 35L
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Classy, RGB-lit design
Effective cooling with dust filtration on the intakes
Strong 4K performance
Cons
Memory and storage upgrades are overpriced
Unimpressive port selection, though good quantity
The Omen 35L configuration we tested was overpriced, especially given its somewhat unbalanced match of a midrange Ryzen 7 7700G CPU with higher-end options like 64GB RAM and an RTX 4080 Super GPU. But if you configure it with the memory and GPU matching the level of the CPU -- an RTX 5060 Ti (with a matching upgrade to an 850W power supply), 1TB SSD and 32GB RAM -- it should grant you a pretty nice mainstream 1080p/1440p system for around $1,500. The system has a solid build quality with an uncluttered design visible behind the glass. It's not the cheapest you'll find for the configuration, but HP's a solid manufacturer. And while it has a reasonable number of connections for gaming, it lacks high-speed connections for data transfer.Note that we've scored it here for the lower price configuration, since it has a much better price/performance balance than the configuration we reviewed.

/10
SCORE
Pros
Really fast and quiet
Compact
Thunderbolt 5/USB4
Cons
Because Apple doesn't support discrete GPUs, you have to buy a more powerful CPU than you might want
Can't upgrade memory
M4 Max model has two fewer Thunderbolt connections than the M3 Ultra, and the front ports aren't USB 4
If you want to run AAA games on the Mac you don't have a lot of choice: It's either the Mac Mini or the Mac Studio (you need the more powerful GPU that you don't get with the base M4 for decent performance, which leaves out the iMac). I err on the side of the Studio because you can get the M4 Max chip and it has a higher power cooling system than the Mini -- since you can't upgrade the either of the systems, you need to buy as much as you can afford now -- but bumping up the Mini to the M4 Pro may be a solid alternative. A lot of non-AAA games that support the Mac don't need as much graphics power but if you're planning to hold on to the system for a while, you might want to assume you'll need more at some point before you're ready to give it up.That said, there still aren't a ton of Mac games, despite Apple's best efforts to attract developers. And a lot of the ones that are available tend to be mobile games adapted or emulated, or free-to-play cloud-based games -- none of which require a lot of power. If that's the case, you don't need a gaming system, and a Mini or iMac should suffice.  ... Show more

Lenovo LOQ Tower: The LOQ Tower can deliver decent 1080p performance in its compact 20-liter case, but it's ultimately a budget system with a budget design. That means it's limited when it comes to options, ports and even airflow. Factors to consider when buying a gaming desktop

If you want high-powered components or a motherboard with more than just a slot for a graphics card, you need a midtower or full tower case -- it needs to accommodate extra cooling or a larger motherboard. If you've got limited space, measure the width and depth you can accommodate and look carefully at a computer's dimensions. If you don't plan on upgrading and can afford to pay for the configuration you're going to still want in three to five years, then you can go with a small form factor, or SFF, PC. While you can use liters as a measurement for case size, actual dimensions are more useful.MotherboardYou generally only can choose the motherboard for custom or DIY builds, but even with a prebuilt system you need to ensure it can meet your needs. For instance, not only that it has sufficient PCI slots but that if you hypothetically require both 16-bit slots to run at maximum bandwidth they will. The motherboard and its chipset determines the maximum possible USB ports; networking types; type and maximum amount of memory; maximum amount and type of SSD and more. Prebuilt and small systems sometimes have proprietary motherboards, so confirm you'll be able to upgrade if you think you'll want to.Operating systemWindows. You can play games on MacOS or Linux, but far more games are developed for and supported on Windows.ProcessorThe CPU doesn't matter as much as other components, but games that spawn and calculate the movements of a lot of objects or characters -- complex simulations and RTS, for example -- may lean on it to run well. AMD's chips with "X3D" in the name are its best gaming CPUs, while Intel's overclockable chips have "K" in their model names and its Core processors are still generally better for desktop gaming than its newer Core Ultra CPUs. GraphicsFor the most part, the GPU is the most important component for running games, not just to render quickly and at high resolutions now, but to drive AI-based upscaling technologies without sacrificing frame rates or smoothly running AI-based technologies of the near future (such as in-game contextual help or smart NPCs). The amount of memory accessible by the GPU also makes a difference: I recommend at least 8GB VRAM for 1080p, 12GB for 1440p or 16GB for 4K. The amount of VRAM tends to correlate with the class of GPU, and the class correlates with speed; in other words, in general (but not necessarily so), more memory means a faster class of card and a faster class of card means a higher frame rate.System memory I don't recommend ANY system with 8GB RAM or less -- 16GB should be your absolute minimum and many games already require that much -- but 32GB is a good bet to support games for at least another few years. Most desktops let you upgrade memory; ultracompacts or all-in-ones may use laptop parts, which means soldered (and therefore not upgradeable) memory, so you want to watch for that if you plan on saving money now.StorageGames are getting bigger and bigger, so more storage is always better. If you play serially you can probably get by backing up to an external SSD, but if you jump around or want to keep multiple games installed on your system (and use the system for more than just gaming!), I suggest 1TB minimum.The review process for desktops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of objective and subjective judgments.  How we test gaming desktops
Dan Ackerman/CNETWe test all desktops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 6 and Geekbench AI, Cinebench 2024, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the desktop), UL Procyon Computer Vision and Image Generation AI benchmarks and more. If a desktop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU), Shadow of the Tomb Raider as part of our core set, then supplement with a variety of other game benchmarks (such as Returnal and Cyberpunk 2077) and general gameplay, all in a variety of resolutions depending upon the system. Our testing suite for systems with discrete graphics also includes SPECviewperf 2020 for pro graphics.For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work and gaming during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. We do not report all the results of our testing, only the data which adds information rather than duplicating a comparative pattern. Gaming computer FAQs
When is the best time to buy a desktop?
Outside of Prime Day and Black Friday sales, there are certain times of the year when you're more likely to find a good desktop deal, or the latest tech -- sometimes both. January is a good time to find a post-holiday deal and is also the month when new models with new components are usually announced at CES. There's generally a lead time before those new models are released. They typically become available in the spring. In the spring months, you will not only find the latest desktops with the latest CPUs from Intel and AMD and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, but you can also find discounts on older models that are suddenly relegated to previous-gen status but are still far from being classified as outdated.The next month to keep an eye out for desktop deals is July, when retailers begin to offer back-to-school sales. Those sales will run through August and into September.This is not to say you can’t lock in a solid desktop deal on any given day of the year. The large manufacturers such as Dell, HP and Lenovo constantly rotate sales on their sites, and retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and Newegg offer discounts weekly.

Should I buy or build my gaming PC
As far as PC gaming goes, all power players ponder how to build a gaming PC at some point or another. As they go through the gaming PC build, they also wonder whether the resulting gaming experience is worth it. Doing your own PC build is a great option if choices and DIY don't scare you -- it's sometimes the only way to get the best gaming PC configuration for your needs -- or if you think PC building will be fun. But it generally doesn't work out to be a way to save money over an identical prebuilt gaming PC, or if you don't know what a motherboard is and how it works. Even if you can get the parts at good prices, the assumption for the cost analysis is that your time is worth zero; labor is part of the price discrepancy between custom build and DIY. And there are other considerations; for instance, I bought a custom build last time because there's no place in my apartment to build one and I didn't need a GPU.It may be cheaper to do your own PC build than getting a premium custom PC model from a company like Origin PC, Maingear , Velocity Micro and the like, but the flip side is that it's nice to have someone else do the overclocking iterations, stability testing and burn-in runs. There are few things more frustrating than gearing up and sitting down to play the latest AAA only to have it crap out during the opening cutscene with only yourself to blame.
