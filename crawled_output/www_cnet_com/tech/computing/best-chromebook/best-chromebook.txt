When Chromebooks first arrived over a decade ago, they were limited in what they could do and needed a web connection to do almost everything. Those days are long gone, and modern Chromebooks can do so much more, including work offline. Plus, Google regularly adds new features and updates security to keep you safe.  Our Picks

All the Chromebooks on this list offer excellent performance and features for their price. Also, while we’re big fans of Chromebooks, if you're still unsure if one is right for you, here's how they compare with a traditional laptop.What is the best Chromebook overall?The Acer Chromebook Plus 514 is the best Chromebook we've tested in the past year. It's a member of Google's Chromebook Plus laptop series, which guarantees a certain level of performance and hardware specs while also offering exclusive software features. It's meant to take the guesswork out of buying a Chromebook for those who want reliable power, not just deep discounts and deals.With Chromebook Plus, you'll get the following:12th-gen Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 7000 processor or better8GB or more of memory128GB or more of storage1080p IPS LCD or better1080p webcam with temporal noise reductionThe newest Chromebook Plus laptops also include 12 months of Google One AI Premium, which includes Gemini Advanced, Gemini for Google Workspace, 2TB of cloud storage and everything else available in the $20-a-month Premium plan. Read more: Why a Chromebook Is Probably All You NeedThe Chromebook Plus 514 hits these requirements and does so for less than $300.

This 14-inch Chromebook Plus model delivers good performance and even better battery life, along with a respectably bright display with a matte finish to limit glare. And it has more storage than you'd typically find at its price. The model we reviewed lacked keyboard backlighting, which was a bit of a bummer, but Acer does sell models with a backlit keyboard that aren’t that much more expensive. With its mix of features and performance for the price, it’s easy to recommend the Acer Chromebook Plus 514 for school, work or home.Acer Chromebook Plus 514 review  ... Show more

Acer's premium two-in-one doesn't stray far from its predecessor in terms of what it offers: sturdy design, nice-looking display, strong performance and long battery life. The main changes are an updated 13th-gen Intel Core i5 processor but Acer removed the garaged pen for use on the touchscreen display. It still works with USI pens. Less expensive options are available, but if you want a Chromebook that'll last for years, this is it. Keep an eye out for a sale on this one, too: It normally lists for around $700, but can often be found on sale for less than $600. Acer Chromebook Spin 714 review  ... Show more

The Lenovo Duet Chromebook (aka Chromebook Duet 3) is an awesome little 11-inch ChromeOS tablet with a detachable keyboard and touchpad. Its small size and performance aren't ideal for full-time use. The Chromebook Duet 3 is a good pick if you're looking for an affordable ultraportable device to get some work done on the go, sketch or jot down notes in class, or do simple stuff like email, web browsing, gaming, reading and streaming video. We've reviewed the next-generation Chromebook Duet 11, but the Duet 3 is still perfectly fine and is heavily discounted for the holiday shopping season.Lenovo Duet Chromebook review  ... Show more

Things to consider when buying a Chromebook
Operating system: Chromebooks run on Google's ChromeOS operating system. It is different than MacOS and Windows and can't natively run software designed for those OSes. Apps: Chromebooks run web apps, Android apps from the Google Play store and Linux software. With more software going online, it's easier than ever to find the applications you need; still, before you buy, check if any necessary apps are available for ChromeOS. Specs: ChromeOS doesn't require powerful components to run smoothly (which is why you can find many good Chromebooks for less than $400). Still, we recommend getting the best hardware you can afford because they can't be upgraded later. AUE: Google gives all Chromebooks an auto-update expiration date. This is when a specific model will no longer receive ChromeOS security and feature updates. These can be checked on Google's site before you buy, and newer models are supported for 8 to 10 years.Security: Because it's nearly impossible for Chromebooks to be corrupted with viruses or other malware, you don't need to worry about extra software to secure a Chromebook. How we test laptops
The review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features in relation to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments. We test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6, Cinebench R23, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported), and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we'll also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU) and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. We have a different set of tests specifically for Chromebooks since they can't run Windows or MacOS software.  For the hands-on, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our How We Test Computers page.  Chromebook FAQs
What is the difference between a laptop and a Chromebook?A Chromebook is a laptop running on Google's ChromeOS instead of Microsoft Windows or Apple's MacOS. This means Windows or Mac software cannot be directly installed and run on a Chromebook. Instead, Chromebooks are designed to use web apps (like those for Microsoft Office 365), Android apps and Linux software. Because ChromeOS is built for efficiency and to take advantage of web or cloud services, the operating system runs well with less expensive hardware. While Chromebooks come in various sizes and designs, options are more plentiful with Windows laptops or Apple MacBooks, especially if you need to run demanding software. Again, ChromeOS is what really makes a laptop a Chromebook but there are some other differences to consider before you buy.
What OS does a Chromebook use? Chromebooks run on Google's minimalist Chrome operating system or ChromeOS. When ChromeOS launched more than a decade ago, it was essentially Google's Chrome web browser. It has grown vastly in capabilities over the years but remains a simple, lightweight and secure operating system that can run briskly on even low-end components. Although ChromeOS can do much more today, quite a lot can be done entirely on the web these days. Take stock of everything you do on a daily basis and you may find there's nothing you can't accomplish with ChromeOS.
What are the pros and cons of a Chromebook? There are several pros to a Chromebook but one big con will instantly rule out buying one. Chromebooks are not natively compatible with Windows or Mac software. If you need to run a specific Windows or MacOS program, you cannot do so directly from a Chromebook. That said, there are ways around it, including finding a substitute web or Android app, or a Linux equivalent.  Also, if you need advanced photo- and video-editing capabilities, you'll want a Windows, Mac or Linux laptop. Basic photo and video editing are fine, but Chromebooks typically don't offer the graphics performance you need for demanding tasks or, again, the option to install Windows or Mac software and games. At least not directly on a Chromebook. Services like Adobe Photoshop on the web and Adobe Express make it possible to do more graphically demanding tasks. One other potential negative is the Auto Update Expiration date, or AUE. Currently, non-Google hardware is only supported for so long before it stops receiving ChromeOS and browser updates, including those for security. For models released now, the date is roughly eight to 10 years from the initial release of the device, but that's not always the case. Google maintains a list of AUE dates for all models, and you should check it before you buy a Chromebook, new or used.  There are many pros to a Chromebook, but the biggest is the price. While premium models start at around $500, you can find excellent options for everyday use for around $350. The Lenovo Duet Chromebook, for example, is a two-in-one Chromebook with a detachable keyboard cover so it can be used as a tablet or a laptop and starts under $400. Like other laptops, a higher-end Chromebook generally means a better experience.  Also, some of the same reasons Chromebooks are popular for schools and businesses make them excellent family computers. Everyone in the family can have separate Google accounts, and signing in gives them access to only their stuff and not yours. Accounts for kids can be managed with Google Family Link. It's nearly impossible for Chromebooks to be corrupted with viruses or other malware. If it isn't running quite right, you can reset it with Chrome's Powerwash feature and in a couple of minutes, the system is clean and fresh. Just sign into your Google account and the Chromebook is completely restored.  Read more: How to Reset a Chromebook in Under a Minute Can I use any USB-C charger for my Chromebook?  Yes and no. Since 2017, new Chromebooks all charge via their USB-C ports. Chromebooks typically need either a 45- or 65-watt power adapter. You'll need to check the specs for your specific model to find its power needs, typically found on the bottom of the Chromebook or on the manufacturer's site. (If it's given in volts and amps, you can get watts by multiplying the two together e.g. 15 volts x 3 amps equals 45 watts.) Using a charger that doesn't meet the power demands of the Chromebook may still charge it but at a slower rate. Also, if you're using the Chromebook while using a low-power charger, it will take even longer to charge fully. On the upside, Chromebooks will display a notification if the USB-C cable you're using won't support the necessary performance.
