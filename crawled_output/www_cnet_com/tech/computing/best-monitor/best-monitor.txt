The Best Monitors to Buy in 2025
Alienware, HP, Apple and more hit our list of the best monitors CNET has tested, from gaming to portable to general purpose.

Article updated on April 23, 2025 at 10:11 AM PDT
Lori Grunin Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras. I've also volunteered with a cat rescue for over 15 years doing adoptions, designing marketing materials, managing volunteers and, of course, photographing cats.

How we test
Factors to consider
Size
You're most likely best off with a 27- or 32-inch flat screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio or a 34-inch curved with a 21:9 aspect ratio.
Resolution
Recommended resolution depends upon the screen size, but you're always better off with the maximum you can afford. I'd say a minimum of 1440p for 27-inch, 4K for 32-inch or larger and at least 1440p for 21:9.
Screen type
OLED or QD-OLED generally have the best contrast, color and pixel refresh speeds, although they may have some artifacts on text. IPS is the best alternative.
Color
The bigger the color gamut the screen covers the better. At a minimum, you want 100% sRGB, but 90% or higher P3 (also known as DCI-P3) is best, as it delivers more colors. Look for specific gamut coverage percentages rather than terms like "1 billion colors," which are essentially meaningless.
Brightness and HDR
In order to produce a decent image that looks like you expect HDR to look, you want the monitor to hit a peak brightness of 600 nits in HDR mode -- you might be able to get away with lower for OLED, but I still would recommend less than 500 nits -- and it's fine if the peak is lower in the standard range, though you still don't really want it lower than 300 for a desktop monitor.
Ports and connectors
They should match whatever you've got on your graphics card or laptop ports, and if you plan to connect via USB-C make sure the monitor's ports support video for it.
Price
Unless you can't afford it, at least $300 (full price, not discounted) for a current-generation model, closer to $600 minimum for OLED and/or decent HDR.
vs
Compare
Back to selection
Monitor preferences can vary, regardless of how objective your testing is. For instance, I prioritize color accuracy and connection locations over sleek curves; you may feel the opposite. And while expensive monitors aren't necessarily better than cheaper ones, you usually have to spend more or make compromises, especially for specialized displays used for color work or gaming. Throw in the long sales life of monitors -- you'll find years-old monitors for sale, sometimes for great prices but sometimes not -- and even I scratch my head sometimes about whether a new model is worth it, how to winnow down the selection, and even how to figure out which model I'm looking at on retail sites. I hope this helps. Our Picks

Does color accuracy matter?
Which is the best monitor overall?I've been testing imaging and graphics products for decades, and when it comes to monitors my favorite overall at the moment are OLEDs and QD-OLEDs, because they're so flexible. My top pick is the LG Ultragear 32GS95UE, a 32-inch, 4K OLED with many of the capabilities I expect for both gaming and creating. There's dual refresh rate support (240Hz at 4K and 480Hz in 1080p), granular control over the settings, a lot of color tools for creators and excellent built-in speakers for your general-purpose needs. It's pretty expensive but not outrageous for a high-end monitor. A bigger screen but for a lot less is Innocn's 40-inch 40C1R at $450. It's not great but it's good enough all around -- especially if you can find it when the price dips. If you need advice on whether a particular type of monitor is right for you, there are some answers to common questions at the bottom of the list and a lot more guidance available in our general monitor and gaming monitor buying guides. You can also find some related buying advice for finding the best laptop (for Windows users or MacBook seekers), best gaming laptop or using an iPad as an external displayRead more: Best Gaming MonitorsBest Portable Monitors

Best monitor overall
LG Ultragear 32GS95UE
Pros
Excellent display quality for gaming, including 4K/240Hz and 1080p/480Hz modes
Great speakers
Free LG Calibration Studio software (to create/update built-in profiles)
A ton of settings
Cons
Controller utility doesn't have many of the settings that are in the OSD
No DisplayPort 2.1, which you'd expect for the money
So many settings it's hard to keep track of them
Some artifacts on small text
No USB-C
It's expensive, but the 4K QD-OLED Ultragear 32GS95UE has a great balance of features, design and performance. It's got excellent display quality -- all the benefits of OLED, including true blacks for high contrast, full P3 gamut coverage, good color accuracy and fast pixel refresh. LG throws in a ton of panel features, such as 240Hz/480Hz dual-refresh rate support (although 480Hz is only in 1080p), built-in color profiles that are updateable via LG's software and an optional color calibrator, almost over-granular control over display settings and more.In addition, the monitor has terrific integrated under-screen speakers that are significantly better than those you typically find in any monitor. They're loud enough to be usable (and definitely louder than the usual pair of dinky 2W drivers), and are definitely up to ambient audio gameplay, music and movies; the drawback to the design is that, off-angle, the sound gets a bit muffled.It's my top pick at the moment, but that's because it offers a good balance, not because it's flawless. It has quite a few flaws -- for a monitor in its price class -- including no DisplayPort 2.1 support, no USB-C (for either video input or power delivery) and artifacts on small text that may be a deal-killer for some people. The stand is pretty standard, and while sturdy, it feels a bit plasticky.My test measurements showed decent but not stellar accuracy out of the box -- not sufficient for color-critical work, at least. Standard white points are generally around 6300K, gamma 2.2-2.3 and brightness is about 265 by default but can hit as high as 400 nits in SDR. Accuracy averages under 3 Delta e 2000, but you can probably improve it with a calibration tune-up. HDR peak brightness hovers around 650 nits for a 10% window -- that's with peak brightness set to low but which has the best tone-mapping curve -- but you can push it to over 1,200 nits in a 1% window if you crank everything. You really don't want to.The display is nominally priced at $1,400, and I don't know that I'd pay that much for it. It's relatively new and still has dropped to as low as $1,000 with discounts, so if you can find it for that or less it's a good deal.  ... Show more

Best portable monitor
Arzopa Z1RC
Pros
Solid performance and features for the price and class
Versatile built-in stand
Cons
Dimmer than the specs indicate, though not bad
Don't bother with HDR: it's too dim for a real HDR display
From its 16-inch size to its versatile kickstand to its slim, lightweight build, the Z1RC is impressive for its price. The 2,560x1,600 resolution helps make everything sharp at this size, and it's exceptionally colorful, covering as much as 94% of the DCI-P3 color space and completely covering the sRGB color space in our testing. It’s not the brightest display, but at over 360 nits as measured, it's impressive for a portable monitor, and combined with an anti-glare finish, it's easy to see in most conditions.The Z1RC is pretty flexible with how you set it up, too. It has two USB-C ports and can run off a single-cable connection with a compatible device. Its second port is handy if you need auxiliary power or when you need broader compatibility with its mini HDMI input. A built-in kickstand also makes it easy to prop the monitor up horizontally and vertically. Of the portable monitors I’ve tested recently, the Arzopa Z1RC leads the way in many respects, and the fact that it’s also one of the most affordable options cements its place as a leading option.  ...

A last-gen favorite for gaming
Alienware 34 QD-OLED (AW3423DW)
Pros
Great gaming performance and quality
Excellent color and tonal accuracy, notably in the dark shadow areas
Nice set of controls
Three-year warranty against burn-in
Cons
Radiates some heat through the screen
Annoying connector arrangement and cable management
The combination of OLED with Samsung's Quantum Dot color technology made this Alienware 34-inch a standout when it launched a few years ago. It still delivers great gaming performance and quality, terrific color and tonal accuracy (notably in the dark shadow areas, where OLED is weak), solid HDR support, a USB hub, a decent set of controls and an above-average three-year warranty against burn-in, making it hard to beat at its lower price. It's not perfect: It doesn't have speakers, though the ones built into monitors tend to be pretty lame, and I'm not thrilled with the design of the connector layout and cable management, to mention a couple nitpicks. But it's certainly a top all-around choice.In September 2023, Alienware announced a slightly less expensive followup model, the AW3423DWF, which was essentially the same panel, but it supports FreeSync Pro and VESA Adaptive-Sync
instead of G-Sync, has two DP connectors and one HDMI (versus the opposite on the older model) and 120Hz VRR when hooked up to a console. There might be some other tweaks since it loses the extra overhead of the G-Sync silicon (for instance, it supposedly can mount closer to a wall with a VESA mount).Read our Alienware 34 QD-OLED (AW3423DW) review.  ...

Best monitor for the all-Mac creator
Apple Studio Display
Pros
Excellent color accuracy and Apple-standard color profiles
Good speaker system for a monitor
Cons
No physical controls -- all settings only via MacOS
No HDR
Meh Windows compatibility if that matters to you
Height adjustable stand is extra cost and no choices allow swiveling or rotation
Only a single input connection
No easy-access ports
Pricey but pretty -- with excellent color accuracy and reference profiles plus a good, six-speaker audio system -- the Apple Studio Display gives Mac ecosystem fans exactly what one expects from Apple. That includes some of the downsides as well, such as a lack of physical controls, no HDR support, extra cost to geta stand that lets you adjust the height (with no swivel or rotation), a single input connection and all three USB-C ports on the back rather than somewhere more easily accessible.Read our Apple Studio Display review.  ...

Best budget big-screen monitor
Innocn 40C1R
Pros
Nice and roomy
Generally solid performance for the money
Includes VESA mounting hardware
Cons
Don't buy for HDR--like most DHDR 400 monitors it's not worth it
Action-gaming can have motion blur
Somewhat low resolution for its size
Little to no documentation plus a lot of mysterious settings is confusing
The 40-inch flatscreen Innocn trades some excellence for value, making it a solid general-purpose monitor if you need a big 'un for less and are OK with above average, but not best-in-class, gaming or color-critical accuracy. Plus, it ships with VESA mounting hardware in the box, which is convenient if you want to mount it on a wall or an arm, and unlike a lot of "value" competitors, it has a USB-C connection with 90-watt power delivery.Like many big-for-less displays, the Innocn has somewhat low resolution for its size -- 3,440x1,440 pixels -- but if you normally scale your view, then it should suit. Gaming is solid, but if you play games with really fast moving action, the motion artifacts may bother you. It does handle 144Hz (DP) and 100Hz (HDMI) refresh rates, though. And it has a lot of features that are either minimally effective or undocumented.Read our Innocn 40C1R review.  ... Show more

Other notable monitors we tested
Sony InZone M9 II ($798) This PlayStation-optimized monitor -- though it's not from Sony's PlayStation division -- is a great HDR experience (DisplayHDR 600 with local dimming) and works as advertised with the PS5. With the update, Sony fixed one of my biggest pet peeves, the horrible stand.Alienware AW3225QF ($1,000): OLED screens tend to be glossy, which a lot of people like; colors pop more and they tend to look a little slicker. If you're in front of the screen for hours or there's particularly reflective stuff behind you (like a window, for example) your eyes and brain will thank you for a less reflective screen. The Alienware AW3225QF's fits the bill. HP Omen 27QS ($220): This is a solid 1440p budget model -- pretty low-end for gaming but OK for general use -- but it's only worth the money if you can find it on sale.
Factors to consider
The trick to finding the right general-purpose monitor is getting sufficient display area, contrast, color and features (most importantly, connections) at an affordable price without sacrificing too much elsewhere. Here's my advice on what to consider to get the most for your money.SizeAll else being equal, if you've got the space and budget, bigger is almost always better. Screen size labeling is based on the diagonal measurement: That made it easy to compare monitor sizes when almost every screen had the same aspect ratio -- essentially the proportions of the screen rectangle, which is the ratio of horizontal to vertical pixels. Wide and ultrawide screens on desktops and newer ratios on laptops (such as 3:2 or 16:10) make cross-size comparisons a little more difficult. You may need to factor in the aspect ratios your favorite games support. If they only offer 16:9 options, configuring them for a widescreen 21:9, 24:10 or 32:9 monitor can be annoying and frustrating; you may also be able to save some money.If you remember your geometry and algebra, you can calculate the width and height of the display if you also know the aspect ratio. (Because width/height = aspect ratio and width² + height² = diagonal²) The further from 1:1 the aspect ratio is, the wider the screen and more of it will be out to the sides -- and therefore in your peripheral vision if you're sitting close. It will also let you figure out the physical dimensions of the screen, most notably the width, to ensure it will fit in the allotted space. DPI Calculator can do the math for you, but keep in mind that the numbers only represent the panel size, not the size of the display, which includes bezels and the mount. Nor does it take into account curved displays, which tend to have smaller horizontal dimensions than their flat-screen equivalent. ResolutionResolution, the number of vertical by horizontal pixels that comprise the image, is inextricable from screen size when you're choosing a monitor. What you really want to optimize is pixel density, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display, because that's what primarily determines how sharp the screen looks as well as how big elements of the interface, such as icons and text, can appear. If you're gaming with a controller at distances further than you'd be sitting at a desk, it can be critical. For instance, I've discovered that I can't read the text well enough to even make it through a tutorial in 1440p on a 32-inch monitor from more than about 4 feet away.Standard resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio include 4K UHD (3,840x2,160 pixels), QHD (Quad HD, 2,560x1,440 pixels) and FHD (Full HD, 1,920x1,080 pixels): You're better off looking at the numbers than the alphabet soup because when you get to variations like UWQHD they can get mind-bogglingly ambiguous. When you see references to "1080p" or "1440p," it's shorthand for the vertical resolution. Examples of widescreen resolutions, which you'll tend to see in 34-inch and larger curved displays, include 3,440x1,440 pixels (21:9) and 5,120x1,440 pixels (32:9).On a 27-inch display, 1,920x1,080 has a pixel density of 81.59 ppi. On a 24-inch display, 1080p works out to 91.79 ppi. Because a higher density is better (up to a point), FHD will look better on the smaller screen. This also depends on your vision: For me, too low a resolution and I can see the pixel grid and at slightly better than that I see nothing but jaggies on small serif type. So "optimal" really depends on what you're looking at and personal preference. My preference for working, highly detailed sims, games with a lot of text and so on is at least 100ppi; if you're moving so fast there's no time to stop and shoot the flowers, you can probably drop to as low as 90ppi. Once again, the DPI Calculator can do the math for you. (A related spec is dot pitch, the size of the space between the center of the pixels, which is just the inverse of pixel density. For that, smaller is better.)Because of the way Windows works (and MacOS, too), you're always better off with the highest resolution possible: You can always change the settings to make things that are too small on a high-res screen larger and change settings to increase frame rates, but you can't make things that are too large on a low-res screen bigger.Screen typeOLED or QD-OLED generally have the best contrast, color and pixel refresh speeds, although they may have some artifacts on text because OLED's one-pixel-one-color structure doesn't antialias (essentially blur the edges of the characters) as well as the filter array technologies (three-primaries-one-pixel-one backlight) used by other panel types. IPS screens with LED backlights are cheaper but still good -- IPS is the best alternative. If they use Samsung's Quantum Dot technology they have better color, and IPS Black panels have better contrast than straight IPS because of its deeper blacks.ColorThe bigger the color gamut the screen covers the better. At a minimum, you want 100% sRGB, but 90% or higher P3 (also known as DCI-P3) is best, as it delivers more colors. Look for specific gamut coverage percentages rather than terms like "1 billion colors," which are essentially meaningless because gamut coverage indicates which of the "billion" are included. If many of them fall outside the color space you need, they're pretty useless.If your work or sideline requires accurate colors -- photo editing, video editing, 3D rendering and the like do if you need or want colors to display the way you shot or designed them -- keep in mind that there are various degrees of accuracy, and color management can be an extremely difficult exercise (in other words, if the colors look "wrong," don't automatically blame your monitor). The most popular measure of visible variance from the "correct" color is Delta E, and the most commonly touted spec is a Delta E of less than 2. That's great for generally accurate color, but that's also an average over a series of color patches. If you need what I call "color-critical accuracy," you really need a maximum Delta E of 2, as well as consistent gray scale. If you plan to output your work for printing, you may also need the monitor to cover more of the Adobe RGB gamut than today's typical sRGB or P3 -- sRGB is tiny and old, and P3 doesn't cover the cyan, yellow and magenta primaries you want for print.Brightness and HDRHigh dynamic range refers to scenes rendered with brighter highlights, greater shadow detail and a wider range of color, for a better-looking image. In order to produce a decent image that looks like you expect HDR to look, you want the monitor to hit a peak brightness of 600 nits (aka cd/m^2) in HDR mode -- you might be able to get away with lower for OLED, but I still would recommend less than 500 nits -- and it's fine if the peak is lower in the standard range, though you still don't really want it lower than 300 for a desktop monitor.For gaming HDR, in contrast to TV HDR, it means more than just a prettier picture: The better you can see what's lurking in the bright and dark areas, the more likely you are to avoid danger and spot clues and looks a lot better than the black-level boost settings a monitor may have. And in photo or video editing, even if you don't plan to export as HDR, the greater brightness range provides some useful latitude when you're color grading or adjusting exposure more precisely. Ports and connectorsIf you plan to connect to your computer via USB-C, make sure the monitor explicitly lists that it supports video out (also known as alt mode or video over USB-C). Just because it has a USB-C port doesn't necessarily mean it can get video input that way. And if you want a real USB hub, you should make sure it includes the types of USB ports you need; for instance, a lot of high-end monitors (surprisingly) have an old USB-B 3.0 connector feeding the monitor's USB-A connections, which can be a pain or limiting.PriceUnless you can't afford it, assume you'll pay at least $300 (full price, not discounted) for a current-generation model, closer to $600 minimum for OLED and/or decent HDR. How we test monitors
All measurements were performed using Portrait Display's Calman Ultimate 2021 R4 and later software using a Calibrite ColorChecker Display Plus (formerly X-Rite i1Display Pro Plus) and a Murideo Six-G pattern generator for HDR testing where necessary, or the Client3 HDR patterns within Calman, where possible. How extensive our testing is depends on the capabilities of the monitor, the screen and backlight technology used, and the judgment of the reviewer.On the most basic models we may stick with just brightness, contrast and color gamut, while on more capable displays we may run tests of most user-selectable modes for gaming or color-critical usage, uniformity and so on. For the color work, we may also run tests to verify how white point accuracy varies with brightness.Color accuracy results reported in units of Delta E 2000 are based on Calman's standard Pantone patch set, plus the grayscale and skin tone patches. White points results are based on both the actual white value plus the correlated color temperature for the entire gray scale (21 patches, 0 to 100%) rounded down to the nearest 50K as long as there are no big variations. We also use Blur Busters' motion tests to judge motion artifacts (such as ghosting) or refresh rate-related problems that can affect gaming.See more details about how we test monitors. Monitor FAQs
What screen size do I need?
Everything being equal, and if you've got the space and budget, bigger is almost always better. Screen size labeling is based on the length of the diagonal: That made it easy to compare when almost every screen had the same aspect ratio (the ratio of the number of horizontal pixels to vertical pixels). But wide and ultrawide screens on desktop and newer ratios on laptops (such as 3:2 or 16:10) make it a little more difficult.If you remember your geometry and algebra, you can calculate the width and height of the display if you also know the aspect ratio (because width/height = aspect ratio and width² + height² = diagonal²). The further from 1:1 the aspect ratio is, the wider the screen and the more the sides will be out of your center of vision if you're up close. The calculation will also let you figure out the physical dimensions of the screen, most notably the width, to ensure it will fit in the allotted space. DPI Calculator can do the math for you.

Should I get two screens or one ultrawide?
This depends on what you're doing. For instance, if you want a fast gaming monitor for play and a high-resolution display for work, it's a lot cheaper to get two than a single one that does both. Or if you need a color-accurate monitor for design but want a high-brightness one for gaming, it's also a lot cheaper to get two smaller ones -- I have two 27-inch models for that reason. But if you just need a ton of screen space, a single ultrawide might be simpler.

Should I get a curved or flat monitor?
To me, curved monitors are the best way to make a single display wider without forcing you to sit too far back; that's why they make more sense for a desktop monitor than for a TV. Optimally, you should be able to see the entire screen without moving your head too much. Once you get beyond roughly 27 inches, that requires a curve if you're sitting at a desk. Don't get me started on the "immersive experiences," of curved screens: Unless that display wraps all the way around me, it's no more immersive than any other. And frankly, I find ultrawide screens less immersive, because, for example, important stuff (like interface elements in a lot of games) is out on the periphery. I also prefer two smaller screens (where "smaller" means 27- or 32 inches) because I like to have one color reference monitor and one fast gaming monitor.At 27 inches and below, aside from the fact that curved displays can look ever so much prettier, one of the few practical applications for it is three-monitor setups, which let you create a more surround-like widescreen experience. Otherwise, small curved screens just aren't worth it, especially if you're paying extra for the privilege. And in fact, I feel like curves on smaller screens bring the edges too far into my peripheral vision for comfort.

What's the best refresh rate for a monitor?
Refresh rate is the number of times per second (in Hertz, or Hz) the screen can update, and affects motion blur and artifacts like tearing or stuttering, which occur when the rate at which the graphics card is feeding the display and the display's refresh rate differ significantly. For any task in which frame rate (frames per second) matters, refresh rate may be an issue. (That predominantly means gaming, though high-frame-rate video editing or viewing may also be affected.) 60Hz is the minimum you want for comfort -- most monitors support that -- and 75Hz is comfortable for most nongaming uses. But IPS and OLED panels can now hit 240Hz or more, which means there's a lot less of a tradeoff using them for gaming than there used to be. You can find everything you've ever wanted to know about refresh rate and more at Blur Busters. To use with an Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 console, you'll want a monitor with an HDMI 2.1 port that explicitly states it supports 4K at 120Hz with variable refresh (also called VRR) support.

Does color accuracy matter?
Ballpark accuracy matters. If you shop online, for example, you want to make sure that cerulean blue shirt is roughly the same color you expect to get. And as long as a monitor has a less-saturated setting than vivid and any level of quality control, you don't need to worry about it. What tends to happen in practice, though, is that a monitor is tuned to produce the most accurate colors it was capable of when it left the factory floor. For this type of everyday accuracy, the amount of a given color space it covers matters more; for instance, sRGB doesn't render a lot of greens as well as Adobe RGB, P3 or other larger spaces, which can give you "that's not the green I ordered" moments.But that's not the type of accuracy manufacturers are talking about when they list specs like "Delta E < 2" or say it's Pantone Validated. What those mean -- or should mean -- is the monitor has been tuned and calibrated so that the difference between a set of color patches as displayed on the screen is the same within a small margin of error to a set of reference patches within the bounds of a specific color space. If that's the type of color accuracy that matters to you, it adds a whole additional layer of requirements and complexity. Just remember: Accuracy is only as meaningful as the least-accurate result, but the Delta E < 2 reported is usually an average.
