Best Laptop for College Students: Top Laptops for School in 2025
It's next to impossible to attend high school or college without a laptop. Here are my favorite laptops that I've tested and reviewed for student budgets.

What to consider
Price
The current sweet spot for a reliable laptop to handle average school tasks is between $700 and $800. For a model suitable for STEM or graphically intensive art classes (or 3D gaming), plan to spend $1,000 and up. Every brand of laptop can be found discounted online at one time or another, so it pays to track deals to find the lowest price.
Operating system
Choosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. MacBooks currently start at $999, so if you need a laptop for significantly less, it's Windows. A Chromebook running on Google's ChromeOS is an excellent (and less expensive) alternative to Windows or MacOS if almost everything you do is in a web browser. Note: They can't run Windows or Mac software.
Size
Remember to consider whether having a lighter, thinner laptop or a touchscreen laptop with a good battery life will be important to you in the future. Size is primarily determined by the screen, which in turn factors into battery size, laptop thickness, weight and price.
Screen
When it comes to deciding on a screen, there are a myriad number of considerations: size, resolution, what types of content you'll be looking at and whether or not you'll be using it for gaming or creative work. Higher resolutions are better for fitting more on a screen and look for a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.
Processor
Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops with Qualcomm emerging as a third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X chips. Meanwhile, Apple makes its own Arm-based chips for MacBooks. More processing cores generally means better performance, but you also need to consider chip architecture -- Intel/AMD x86 vs. Arm -- to gauge potential performance.
Graphics
The graphics processor handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up graphics tasks. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated (iGPU) or discrete (dGPU). Apple's M1, M2 and M3 processors integrate the GPU. In either case, the more processing cores the GPU has, the better the graphics performance. Unless your coursework requires intensive scientific or graphics apps (or you want to play 3D games), you don’t need a laptop with powerful graphics.
Memory
We highly recommend 16GB of RAM, with 8GB being the absolute minimum. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and the storage drive, which is slower.
Storage
You'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in most models. A 256GB SSD is the minimum, and 512GB will last longer without getting filled up.

The summer has passed its midpoint. August is two weeks away, which means the next school year will be here before you know it. If you need a new laptop for school, then it's time to start looking. Whether you want a MacBook or Windows laptop, there are some great options right now. Apple's latest M4 MaBook Air has been selling for a steady $849 at Amazon, which is $150 less than Apple's price for it. I've also got some Windows recommendations that offer great designs and, in some cases, battery life that's even better than the battery life of the long-running MacBook Air. Our Picks

Laptop FAQs
What's the best laptop for college students?Apple's new M4 MacBook Air offers better performance at a lower price inside the same thin-and-light design, making it an easy pick as our go-to recommendation for college students. It starts at $999, which is $100 less than what Apple charged for the previous M3 model. And students can always save $100 on it with Apple's educational discount if you can't find it on sale at Amazon. Before you buy your own laptop for school, it's worth checking if your college offers free or discounted laptops for students.For students on tighter budgets, I still recommend the original MacBook Air M1. It's available as a Walmart exclusive for only $599. It should also get you through four years of school, but I think the extra money is worth it for the updated design, slightly larger display, higher-resolution webcam and better performance of the newer M4 model. The M4 Air is also available in 13- and 15-inch sizes, so you can choose between greater mobility or more workspace.A Windows rival to the MacBook Air has arrived with Microsoft's first Copilot Plus PC. Based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon Elite X CPU, the Surface Laptop 7 offers strong application and AI performance and outstanding battery life. It's the first Windows laptop we've tested with a longer runtime than the Air's. At $2,000, the Surface Laptop 7 model I reviewed may be beyond the reach of student budgets, but the line starts at a more approachable $1,000 and should still offer ample performance for most students and the same lengthy runtime of the system I tested. I love the overall design of the Surface Laptop 7, but the Asus Zenbook A14 is arguably better suited for campus life with its ultralight design and an even longer runtime than that of the Surface Laptop 7.With so many resources and so much of your course curriculum available online, it's next to impossible to get through college without a laptop. There is no shortage of laptops for sale, which makes it difficult to zero in on one that will fit your needs and budget. That's where my laptop colleagues and I come in. We've done research and testing to find the best laptop for college students in 2025. Whether you are looking for a MacBook, a Windows laptop or a Chromebook for school, we've rounded up several college laptop picks that will serve most students well. Best laptops for students in 2025

Pros
Big performance gains from M1, Intel MacBook Airs
Great design, features
Support for two external displays simultaneously with MacBook display
12-megapixel Center Stage camera
Cons
256GB SSD might fill up fast
Expensive upgrades
For Apple’s latest MacBook Air, the bigger news than moving from Apple's M3 silicon to M4 chips is the drop in price.Why we like itStarting at $999, the MacBook M4 Air is $100 cheaper than the entry point for the previous M3 models. In addition to a slight bump in performance over the previous generation, the M4 Air adds a Center Stage webcam, better support for external displays and a new ice blue color option.Who it's best forThe M4 chip refresh adds up to a good, if minor, update to an already fantastic lightweight laptop that’s now more affordable for students and those on tight budgets. With its mix of strong overall performance, long battery life and a trim design, it’s no wonder it’s such a popular laptop for students. Who shouldn't get itAnyone who is buying a MacBook Air for toting around the house instead across campus will enjoy the roomier display of the 15-inch Air. Also, graphics pros who need the power of a Pro will need to spend more for a 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro.  ... Show more

Built around an Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, the Zenbook A14 is the lightest Copilot Plus PC we've tested and the second-longest running. It weighs less than 2.2 pounds and offers a battery life of more than 24 hours.Why we like itIts Ceraluminum shell allows the Zenbook A14 to be incredibly light yet rigid, and its 14-inch OLED display is excellent. It also serves up ample RAM and storage for the price.Who it's best forStudents and anyone who is on the road with regularity for their job. If portability is paramount, then the lightweight, long-running Zenbook A14 is the pick.Who shouldn't get itIf you are concerned about Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues, then you should skip the Zenbook A14 and find an Intel- or AMD-based laptop.  ...

SCORE
Pros
Class-leading battery life
Strong performance
Awesome and accurate haptic touchpad
Cons
No OLED option
Upgrades get costly and don't include dedicated GPU
Your Arm-on-Windows compatibility mileage may vary
The Surface Laptop 7 model I reviewed rings in at $2,000, which is beyond the reach of most student budgets. The line starts at $1,000, which makes it a bit more accessible. Students will like its polished design and class-leading battery life. Our test model ran for nearly 20 hours on a single charge, and you can expect a similar runtime from the entry-level unit. Why we like itI like it for its polished design and class-leading battery life. The Surface Laptop 7 ran for nearly 20 hours in testing -- that’s the longest of any 13- or 14-inch laptop I've ever tested -- including the M4 MacBook Air. The Surface Laptop 7 competes with the MacBook Air in performance and battery life and supplies a similarly sleek and solid build.Who it's best forPeople who love the look and long battery life of the MacBook Air but want a Windows laptop. I wish there were an OLED display option, and you’ll need to do a compatibility check for your mission-critical applications before embracing the Arm-based Surface Laptop 7, but if you can get past those hurdles, then you’ll get a well-built, good-looking and long-running Windows ultraportable. You don't necessarily need to spend the roughly $2,000 that our test system costs; one of the lower-priced configurations that starts at $900 should meet the needs of most people.Who shouldn't get itAnyone worried about potential Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues should skip Qualcomm-based laptops and pick out an Intel or AMD model. The Surface Laptop 7 is also not the pick if you want an OLED display on your next laptop. For more, check out my other favorite Windows laptops.  ... Show more

This recent release from Acer's budget Aspire line is based on an Intel Lunar Lake CPU. Its Intel Core Ultra 5 226V features a neural processing unit (NPU) capable of 40 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for local AI processing, which happens to be the minimum requirement for Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC platform. The Aspire 14 AI costs just $750 at Costco, making it the cheapest Copilot Plus PC we've reviewed.Why we like itThe Aspire 14 AI a great pick among budget laptops. Its performance and battery life exceed what you can expect for the price and the design is nearly the same as you get with Acer's more expensive Swift models. You're forced to sacrifice display quality to hit such a low price but that's an item that's usually not very high on a budget shopper's priority list. More important is getting a modern CPU that delivers sufficient performance for everyday use that's also efficient to allow for lengthy battery life -- plus a bit of future-proofing with its AI capabilities. Who it's best forWith the lengthy battery life we've come to expect from Copilot Plus PCs and with application and AI performance that's competitive with pricier models, the Aspire 14 AI offers great value for students looking for a cheap, sturdy and long-running laptop.Who shouldn't get itIf you care about the overall look of your next laptop and have the money, you can find more exciting designs. Spending more will also get you a brighter display with better color performance.  ... Show more

This model has been surpassed, but not replaced, by the newer M4 model. Now, the M1 Air is available at Walmart for $649, which is a hefty $350 less than its original price. It's also $350 less than the new M4 MacBook Air.Why we like itThe M1 MacBook Air was released in November 2020. It offered a huge leap in performance from the previous Intel-based MacBook Air. Fast-forward nearly four-and-a-half years, however, and you arrive at the M4 MacBook Air that Apple launched earlier this year. We tested it and unsurprisingly found the M4 Air's performance was significantly better than that of the M1 Air. Even if you don't think you need the added performance, the newer processor means the M4 model will have a longer useful lifespan. But at just $649, the M1 MacBook Air at Walmart costs significantly less than the $999 M4 Air at Apple.Who it's best forIt's a great pick for students and other budget shoppers looking for a speedy and stylish do-it-all laptop. It's thin, light and built like a tank. It has a slightly smaller display than the current M4 Air and offers only two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, but for most people that's enough. And even though it's been surpassed by newer generations, the original M1 Air is still powerful enough for general use and a great buy at its discounted price.Who shouldn't get itBuyers whose budgets extend to $1,000 should skip the older M1 model and opt instead of the latest M4 Air.  ...

Like other gaming laptop makers, Acer has two lines: a budget-friendly Nitro series and midrange and premium models that carry the Predator label. Oddly enough, it's under the latter you'll find our budget gaming pick: the Helios Neo 16.Why we like itIt's strikingly similar to the Acer's own Nitro 16 but with slightly better build quality and graphics performance. The only place it really faltered was its speakers, which put out disappointingly flat audio with nonexistent bass.Who it's best forIt's a great pick for gamers on student budgets. It's getting harder to find the Predator Helios Neo 16 I reviewed with RTX 4050 graphics, but a model with a RTX 4060 isn't a bad deal at its $1,400 price at Amazon.Who shouldn't get itGamers with more than $1,000 or so to spend can get a better design, higher-resolution display and a newer GPU than what the Predator Helios Neo 16 supplies.  ...

Acer Chromebook Plus 514 review
Add to compareMost recent addition
The Acer Aspire 14 AI is the newest laptop on the list. It's the cheapest Copilot Plus PC I've reviewed and one of the best budget laptops for its sturdy design, competitive performance and long battery life. And unlike with other Copilot Plus PCs based on Qualcomm's Arm-based Snapdragon X series processors, you don't have to worry about any potential Windows-on-Arm compatibility issues with the Intel-based Aspire 14 AI. It's a great budget pick for students. Factors to consider
There's a multitude of laptops on the market that would be a fit for students, and almost all of those models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance needs and budget restraints. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of options, we're here to help with advice on what to consider when shopping for a school laptop.PriceThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price, particularly for cash-strapped college students. To end up with a laptop that will last you at least through four years of school, I would advise against choosing a bargain-basement, entry-level model. Additionally, you could get away with spending less upfront in past years with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradeable, so it's best to get as many laptop capabilities as you can afford from the start.Generally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard.Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average school tasks is between $700 and $800. For art and STEM students who need to run demanding graphics or STEM apps (or those looking for a bit of gaming, after your homework is done, of course), you'll need to spend about $1,000 or a bit more. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capability for less.SizeIf you plan on taking your laptop to class each day, then you'll want a lighter and thinner laptop. I recommend a model with a 13- or 14-inch display for most students. Larger 15- and 16-inch models provide more screen real estate for getting work done and juggling multiple windows, but you'll probably get tired of dragging it across campus.SpecsIf you are targeting a 14-inch laptop for school, then the basic display resolution of 1,920x1,200 should suffice for creating crisp text and images. The sharpness of the picture will improve as you go up in resolution, but you don’t need a 4K display for such a small screen. If your budget allows, look for an OLED display with a 2240x1400, 2560x1600 or 2880x1800. Not only will the increased pixel count improve the picture, but the superior contrast ratio and color performance of an OLED will be evident compared with that of an IPS LED display.For internals, Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to Intel's or AMD's sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.Apple makes its own chips for MacBooks, which makes things slightly more straightforward. The entry-level MacBook Air uses an M1 chip, and the latest Air models feature M3 chips.Battery life is paramount for a student laptop, and it has less to do with the number of CPU cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple's Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based Copilot Plus PCs we've tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.If you plan to study art and your course of study will involve using graphics-intensive creative apps, then you will need a Windows laptop with a dedicated Nvidia GPU or a more powerful MacBook Pro. The same can be said for STEM students who will be using powerful scientific apps as well as any student who might want to play PC games on their laptop. Costs increase quickly, however, when you jump from integrated graphics to an Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU or from a MacBook Air to a MacBook Pro.For memory, I highly recommend 16GB of RAM, with 8GB being the absolute bare minimum. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. I suggest at least 16GB of RAM for a Windows laptop, but most students should be fine with the standard 8GB that Apple offers on its baseline MacBook Air. Plus, Apple charges a hefty sum for 16GB. For storage, get at least a 256GB SSD and 512GB SSD if you can. If you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive down the road or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: I don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new one.Operating systemChoosing an operating system is part personal preference and part budget. For the most part, Microsoft Windows and Apple's MacOS do the same things (except for gaming, where Windows is the winner), but they do them differently. Unless there's an OS-specific application you need, go with the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're not sure which that is, head to an Apple store or a local electronics store and test them out. Or ask friends or family to let you test theirs for a bit. If you have an iPhone or iPad and like it, chances are you'll like MacOS too.When it comes to price and variety (and PC gaming), Windows laptops win. If you want MacOS, you're getting a MacBook. Apple's MacBooks regularly top our best lists, they are costly although the original M1 MacBook Air is still available for just $649.Windows laptops can be found for as little as a couple of hundred dollars and come in all manner of sizes and designs. Granted, we'd be hard-pressed to find a $200 laptop we'd give a full-throated recommendation to, especially if you need it to last you through four years of school.If you are on a tight budget, consider a Chromebook. ChromeOS is a different experience than Windows; more streamlined and easier to use. It's limited, in that basically everything runs through the Chrome browser. Just make sure that your school or coursework doesn't require you to use apps that run only on a Windows or Mac machine. How to get the best laptop for high school students
There is plenty of overlap between what makes a good laptop for college and a good laptop for high school. Without college-level coursework and with other PCs perhaps in the house, high school students may be able to use a Chromebook for all of their school needs and requirements. High schoolers may be able to look at a laptop purchase as a shorter-term investment: buy an inexpensive, lower-end model to get you to graduation, at which point summer job earnings or a grad gift from a grandparent could lead you to your next laptop for college and beyond. How we test laptops for students
The review process for laptops consists of two parts: performance testing under controlled conditions in the CNET Labs and extensive hands-on use by our reviewers. This includes evaluating a device's aesthetics, ergonomics and features with respect to price. A final review verdict is a combination of both objective and subjective judgments.
CNET Labs technician Samantha De Leon makes her way around the facility's 61 marked locations to test each router's signal strength.
Adam Breeden/CNETWe test all laptops with a core set of benchmarks, including Primate Labs Geekbench 5 and 6, Cinebench R23, PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark benchmarks (whichever can run on the laptop), UL Procyon Photo and Video (where supported) and our own battery life test. If a laptop is intended for gaming, we also run benchmarks from Guardians of the Galaxy, The Rift Breaker (CPU and GPU) and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.For the hands-on test, the reviewer uses it for their work during the review period, evaluating how well the design, features (such as the screen, camera and speakers) and manufacturer-supplied software operate as a cohesive whole. We also place importance on how well they work given their cost and where the manufacturer has potentially made upgrades or tradeoffs for its price.
We also weigh the laptop to see how its heft compares to other similarly sized laptops, which is especially important for students who will be toting their laptop to and from school each day. We also pay attention to the build quality to assess how sturdy or flimsy a laptop is, which is another important consideration for students who will rely on a laptop day and and day out for at least four years.The list of benchmarking software and comparison criteria we use changes over time as the devices we test evolve. You can find a more detailed description of our test methodology on our How We Test Computers page. Other student laptops we tested

Is Mac or Windows better for college students?
Deciding between MacOS and Windows laptops for many people will come down to personal preference and budget. Apple's base model laptop, the M1 MacBook Air, starts at $999 but is regularly discounted to $750. For a newer M2 MacBook, be prepared to spend $1,000 or more.For the money, you're getting great hardware top to bottom, inside and out. Apple has moved to using its own processors, which resulted in across-the-board performance improvements compared to older Intel-based models. That great hardware comes at a price. Also, you're limited to just Apple laptops. With Windows and Chromebooks (more on these below), you get an amazing variety of devices at a wide range of prices. Software between the two is plentiful, so unless you need to run something that's only available on one platform or the other, you should be fine to go with either. Gaming is definitely an advantage for a Windows laptop. MacOS is considered to be easier and safer to use than Windows, especially for people who want their computers to get out of the way so they can get their schoolwork done. Over the years, Microsoft has done its best to follow suit and try to remove any barriers with Windows 11. Also, while Macs might have a reputation for being safer, with the popularity of the iPhone and iPad helping to drive Mac sales, they've become bigger targets for malware.

Are Chromebooks worth it for students?
Yes, they are, but they're not for everyone. Google's ChromeOS has come a long way in the 10-plus years since it arrived, and Chromebooks -- laptops that run on ChromeOS -- are great for students who do most of their work in a web browser or using mobile apps. They are secure, simple and, more often than not, a bargain. What they can't do is natively run Windows or Mac software. With their low cost and ease of use, Chromebooks are a natural fit for students, but be sure your school or particular course of study doesn't have certain software requirements that make a laptop with either Windows or MacOS a requisite.
Show more
Is Dell or HP better for college students?
One isn’t necessarily better than the other, and each has at least one laptop that’s a good fit for students. We like HP’s Pavilion 14 Plus is great for providing a solid, all-metal design and OLED display for less than $1,000. Dell’s Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 is another good $1,000 laptop with a sturdy, all-aluminum enclosure that also provides incredible, all-day battery life thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor.

What is the best laptop for school work and gaming?
You can play games on any laptop. What games you play and what content you create -- and the speed at which you do them -- varies greatly depending on the components inside the laptop. For casual browser-based games or using streaming game services like Nvidia GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming, you don't need a powerful gaming laptop. Similarly, if you're trimming video clips, cropping photos or live-streaming video from your webcam, you can get by with a modestly priced laptop or Chromebook with integrated graphics. For anything more demanding, you'll need to invest more money in discrete graphics like Nvidia's RTX 30- or 40-series GPUs. Increased system memory of 16GB or more, having a speedy SSD of at least 512GB for storage and a faster processor such as an Intel Core Ultra 7 or AMD Ryzen 7 will all help you get things moving faster too. The other piece you'll want to consider is the display. For gaming, look for screens with a high refresh rate of 120Hz or faster so games look smoother while playing. For art students and content creators, look for displays that cover at least 100% sRGB color space or, better yet, 100% DCI-P3.
