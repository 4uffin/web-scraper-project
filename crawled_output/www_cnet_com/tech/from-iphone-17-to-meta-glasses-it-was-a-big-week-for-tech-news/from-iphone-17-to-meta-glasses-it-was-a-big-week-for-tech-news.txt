The new iPhone 17 models started delivery and arrived in Apple Stores today. Anadolu/Getty Images
Many of us remain glued to the story of late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel's indefinite suspension by ABC over controversial comments included in his Sept. 15 monologue. Hard-hitting (and hilarious) reactions from colleagues like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon have helped the story dominate headlines all week. If you're looking to take a break from doomscrolling, it was a huge week for tech news. The new iPhones are on sale today; Meta unveiled its latest VR glasses (at an event that quickly became famous for its embarrassingly bad live demos); and CNET continues to find new ways to rigorously test the tech devices you depend on every day.Take a look at five of the biggest tech stories you may have missed this week.Apple's Super-Slim iPhone Air Had Me on Edge... Until I Tested It
The ultrathin iPhone Air is incredibly light, but what about that battery? Zooey Liao/CNETThe iPhone Air -- Apple's "wildly thin" replacement for the iPhone Plus -- was love at first sight for CNET's Abrar Al-Heeti, but what about the sturdiness and battery life of a phone that's only 5.6mm wide?Abrar examines the super-thin phone's durability, design, sound, and cameras (don't miss the spectacular teatime photos) with an exhaustive review of the iPhone Air that should help anyone considering taking a chance on Apple's ultra-light phone. We've also got reviews on the new standard iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, the Apple Watch Series 11 and the AirPods 3 Pro.Our Exclusive Lab Testing on 100 Cordless Vacuum Cleaners Tells Us One Surprising Truth
We crunched the numbers on 100 cordless vacuums to see how they compare on price, battery and power. Credit: Cole Kan/CNET/Getty/Dreame, Shark, LevoitWhen it comes to cordless vacuums, does a higher price mean a longer battery life and more powerful suction? Not always. CNET writer Ajay Kumar and lab engineer Schylar Breitenstein took a deep dive into our exclusive labs vacuum data and discovered an unexpected revelation. Get all the details you need to make an informed decision on your next stick vacuum.18 Hidden iOS 26 Features You're Missing Out On
CNET experts investigate the myriad details of iOS 26 so you don't have to. Apple/CNETYou might not be taking the plunge on a new iPhone 17, but if you've got an iPhone, you're likely upgrading to iOS 26 this week, and there are a lot of new features packed into Apple's latest operating system for iPhones. CNET software expert Nelson Aguilar dove into all of the nooks and crannies of iOS 26 to find some of the best new features that you probably don't know about (yet). Give it a read to add a new dimension to your iOS mastery. This Mom Is Getting Back Into Running Shape With a Jogging Stroller, Fitness Apps and Tech
Anyone looking to get back into running can benefit from Giselle's look at support from tech and apps. Giselle Castro-Sloboda/CNETTwo years after pausing her practice due to pregnancy and childbirth, CNET marathoner Giselle Castro-Sloboda is psyched to return to running. Learn about her favorite jogging stroller and how she's using apps and wearables to help her reach her new goals.Meta Has the Right Smart Glasses. Let Someone Else Handle the AI
Mark Zuckerberg shows off new Meta smart glasses. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThis week also brought us Meta Connect, and CNET was all over it (even if Mark Zuckerberg's live demos failed miserably). The biggest announcement by far was the new Meta Ray-Bans Gen 2 glasses, which started selling immediately after the event for $379. While the VR glasses are impressive, CNET's Katelyn Chedrouai makes a compelling argument that Meta should leave the AI to another company, like maybe… ChatGPT?
