Speakers
Ultimate Ears Miniroll UE used to make a discus-like speaker called the Roll that floated in water. That model was discontinued but the new Miniroll is even more compact and delivers impressive sound for its size, putting out a little more bass than you'd expect. With up to 12 hours of battery at moderate volume levels, the speaker has a built-in strap that allows you to hook it onto anything from a branch to your bike's handlebars to the shoulder strap on your backpack.It's fully waterproof with an IP67 rating and has a Bluetooth range of up to 40 meters. It's also dust-resistant. While you can link up multiple Minirolls in PartyUp mode, I think most people would be happy with just one. It's one of the best-sounding micro Bluetooth speakers out there, and an excellent tech gift under $100 for anyone. Full Review.

Speakers
Soundcore Motion 300 Bose makes its excellent SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker that sells for around $150 and sometimes goes on sale for less. The Soundcore Motion 300 is Anker's answer to that Bose speaker. Around the same size as the Bose, it doesn't sound quite as good, but it sounds impressive for its compact size and lists for only $80 (it's been on sale for as low as $55). Like the SoundLink Flex, it can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up toward the ceiling or propped up as shown in the photo above. It's IPX7 waterproof and delivers up to 13 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. There's also support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android and other devices that support Bluetooth wireless streaming with LDAC. The speaker has a bass boost button that does amp up the low-end a bit. But I actually thought the speaker sounded a little better without the bass-boost engaged because the speaker seemed slightly overdriven with the boost. Currently, there is an Amazon coupon available to give you $15 off this smart speaker. Read our Soundcore Motion 300 review.

Headphones
Sony CH-720N Sony's CH-720N noise-canceling headphones list for $150, but sometimes you can find them for less than $100. They have a plasticky budget vibe, but are lightweight and comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5s, but their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Read our Sony CH-720N review.

Fire Pits
Solo Stove Mesa XL Solo Stove makes some of the best smokeless fire pits, including the Ranger 2.0 (small), Bonfire 2.0 (medium) and Yukon 2.0 (large) fire pits. But if you're looking for something a little smaller, it also makes two mini fire pits: the Mesa and Mesa XL. Both come in several colors, including traditional stainless steel. I started off using the smaller Mesa, but when the Mesa XL was released, I found myself gravitating to the larger version of the mini fire pit (pictured on the left) because it looks and feels a little more substantial while remaining compact. (As you might expect, it does produce a bigger fire with a heat radius of 2 to 3 feet compared with the Mesa's 1 to 2 feet.) As its name implies, the Mesa XL is designed to sit on a tabletop and is portable. Naturally, you could also set it on the ground, but when you put it on a table, it's at a good height for roasting marshmallows. It has the same 360-degree Signature Airflow system as Solo Stove's larger fire pits.

BioLite HeadLamp 800 BioLite makes several different headlamps, with the BioLite HeadLamp 800 being its brightest model at 800 lumens. It's equipped with front and back lights (the front light swivels) that offer eight different lighting modes. It's good for a variety of settings, whether you're working in a dark environment or just walking your dog or riding a bike at night. The battery is rechargeable via a Micro-USB connection (I do wish it were USB-C).Note that the step-down HeadLamp 425 costs $45, while the HeadLamp 325 is $37.

BioLite Alpenglow 500 BioLite has several portable lighting options, and the Alpenglow 500 is one of its more recent additions. It's a portable lantern that has multiple modes and color options. As its name implies, it delivers 500 lumens, and it is indeed pretty bright.The step-down Alpenglow 250 offers 250 lumens for $15 less. Both are rated for 5 hours of battery life on the high setting and up to 200 hours on the low setting.

Small kitchen appliances
Ninja Blast There are more affordable portable blenders, like the Blendjet 2 and the Hamilton Beach Single-Serve, but the Ninja Blast, which lists for $60, is a step up from those models. It looks and feels more premium, and though it isn't super powerful, it's a good option for making smoothies and protein shakes on the go or at home when you don't want to deal with a full-size blender. Additionally, you can drink right from the blender, as it has a leakproof sip lid. Available in multiple colors and easy to operate, it has an 18-ounce capacity and recharges via USB-C.

Media Streamers
Roku Streambar SE Roku discontinued its larger Streambar Pro speaker, but it's now selling a new mini soundbar, the Streambar SE, that has a 4K Roku video streamer built into it. While it doesn't offer the greatest sound -- it can only output so much bass -- the speaker is quite compact and produces better sound than you'd think given its size. It's particularly strong in the midrange, producing loud, clear dialogue, and it delivers better sound than what you get from most TV speakers (by that I mean the speakers built into your TV). This is really designed to go with a smaller TV that's in your bedroom, home office, or dorm room, and not your main living room TV (unless you have a very small living room).

Portable speakers
Amazon Echo Spot (2nd generation) Like its predecessor, the 2nd-gen Echo Spot has a touchscreen and displays a variety of custom-designed clock faces. It's also Alexa-enabled, allowing you to use your voice to set alarms, access the weather, play music tracks and issue commands to your Alexa smart home products. Along with improved audio quality (it has a 1.73-inch front-firing directional speaker that puts out more bass and clearer audio), the new Echo Spot has a bigger, bezel-less screen. But it's closer to a semicircle than the fully circular screen on the original. Animations and clock faces are displayed crisply. It also displays album art when you listen to music on Spotify, but it's not that sharp.Unlike the original, there's no integrated camera, so you can't make video calls, which is probably a good thing if you're concerned about privacy. You can also ask Alexa to call loved ones, make household announcements, audibly drop in on other Alexa-enabled devices in your household or get alerts and audio from your compatible smart doorbell. It's a nice smart alarm clock that sounds decent for how small it is.

Amazon Smart Thermostat Amazon's Smart Thermostat sets a new standard for the category. It has a clean, modern touchscreen design, and it's easy to use, whether you're adjusting the temperature at the thermostat, through the Alexa app or with Alexa voice commands with a compatible Alexa-enabled speaker or display. It earned a CNET Editors' Choice award for best value smart thermostat. Read our Amazon Smart Thermostat review.

Blenders
NutriBullet Blender 1200 NutriBullet keeps it simple with three power levels, a pulse setting and 1,200 watts of power. It performed well in all of our tests. Smooth batters, finely crushed ice, green smoothies, hot soup and good grated cheese (our torture test) were all easy to achieve. A reasonable price tag means you won't have to break the bank to get a good blender.The 64-ounce blending jar is plenty big enough for most recipes. The personal blender comes with a handy recipe book and a tamper to make sure all your ingredients contact the blades. The NutriBullet blender jar is also dishwasher-safe and comes with a one-year warranty. Simple, powerful and consistent, the NutriBullet is one of the best moderately priced blenders on the market right now.

Google Nest Hub (2nd gen) There are plenty of great Alexa-powered Echo products, but in this price range, we're still fans of the Google Nest Hub (2nd gen), which has been around for a few years but is a good value when it gets discounted. The upgraded smart display delivers more bass along with a new Sleep Sensing feature. It also gives you instant access to a world of answers whenever you say, "Hey, Google," and allows you to cast content directly to the screen from any Android device.

Media Streamers
Roku Ultra The Roku Ultra has always been a fine 4K HDR streamer. As the flagship in Roku's extensive line of sticks and players, its bag of nifty tricks includes a remote finder and a remote with programmable remote buttons. This version adds better Wi-Fi, a faster processor and the ability to stream in Dolby Vision -- a long-awaited feature that allows it to better compete with the best streamers from Amazon, Apple and Google. Yes, the Roku Express 4K Plus, which costs around $25, is a better value, but the upgraded Ultra is often on sale these days for $80 (it lists for $100) and it has an Ethernet port for those who want to go with a wired connection.

Keyboards
Logitech Keys-To-Go 2 Logitech makes a variety of wireless keyboards, but its Keys-to-Go carries the distinction of being the company's thinnest and lightest Bluetooth keyboard. It isn't as slim as its predecessor, though it has a better typing experience with real scissor keys and a built-in protective cover that folds back and slips under the keyboard when you're ready to go to work. Multi-OS compatible, the Keys-to-Go-2 is available in lilac, pale grey and graphite for $65-80.While I can't say the typing experience is as good as Logitech's MX Keys Mini -- and the keyboard may be a bit cramped for folks with larger hands -- it's one of the best typing experiences you'll get from an ultraportable keyboard. In other words, keep your expectations in check (which is admittedly harder to do when you're dealing with an $80 keyboard).  The original Keys-to-Go only worked with one device at a time, but this model, like Logitech's other recent keyboards, allows you to connect to three devices simultaneously. You can jump between devices using the Easy-Switch keys on the top left of the keyboard. The Keys-to-Go 2 isn't rechargeable, but Logitech says its replaceable coin cell batteries can give you up to three years of battery life. Read our Logitech Keys-To-Go 2 review.

Twelve South HoverBar Duo Twelve South's HoverBar Duo is a flexible stand for iPads and other tablets that has a weighted base and an articulating arm to adjust the angle and height of your device. You can also remove the HoverBar from its base and clip it to a bar or shelf using the shelf clip. The second-gen model has a quick-release design, but the first-gen model is about $20 cheaper at around $65.If you're looking for a way to use your iPad in the kitchen, as a second monitor or as a videoconferencing display, the HoverBar Duo is a nice accessory and makes a great gift for all those iPad owners out there.

Anker 622 MagGo magnetic battery What's cool about Anker's 622 magnetic battery is that it's a wireless battery that has an integrated magnetic flap that converts into a stand. You won't get fast wireless charging from this 5,000 mAh battery (it charges at up to 7.5 watts) but it's slim and easy to carry around. It charges via USB-C, and if you use a USB-C-to-Lightning cord to charge your iPhone, it will charge at a faster rate of 12 watts. That's not as fast as what a 20-watt USB-C power adapter can deliver, but it's faster than 7.5 watts.Note that Anker has updated this model to move the charging port to the side (from the bottom), so you can charge it while using it as a stand. That's a worthy upgrade worth the $5 premium versus the old version (which confusingly retains the same 622 model number).

Computer Accessories
RiotPWR RP1950 I previously had the RiotPWR Mobile Cloud Gaming Controller for iOS, but it had one flaw. Because it had an integrated Lightning cable that allows for lag-free gaming -- at least when it comes to button presses -- you couldn't use it with newer iPads or iPhones that have a USB-C connection. The new RiotPWR RP1950 controller solves that problem by allowing you to swap out the Lightning cable module for a USB-C cable module. Like RiotPWR's earlier iOS controller, which is white, the black RP1950 is a more traditionally shaped Xbox-like controller that includes a mount for your phone. While there's no built-in battery that keeps your phone charged while playing, like the Backbone and Razer Kishi V2, this model has a pass-through charging option if you want to hook up a separate Lightning cable to a battery pack or wall charger.The controller is nicely designed and doesn't feel cheap (the dock can accommodate a variety of iPhones, including larger iPhone Max models). Remove the dock and you can use this with any iPad that has a Lightning or USB-C port. To swap cables, you have to stick a paper clip in a hole in the bottom of the controller, which releases the cable module. It's a little tricky the first time you do it, but once you figure out how it's done, it's pretty straightforward.It's also worth noting that even though this is called an "iOS controller," it will work with Android smartphones and tablets that have USB-C ports.

Headphones
HyperX Cloud 3 HyperX makes several gaming headsets, and most of them are quite good. But over the years, the models I tend to gravitate toward are in its Cloud line, including the Cloud 3. Not only is this a very solid performing wired gaming headset, but it's comfortable to wear and doesn't cost too much (a wireless version of the same headset costs about $125 or $50 more). Since this is a wired model, it works with a variety of platforms and can be plugged into PS5 and Xbox Series X/S controllers along with PCs and anything else that has a headphone port. The microphone is detachable.

Backbone One We liked this Lightning-connected controller from startup Backbone when it first came out in its original black version. You can still get that model, but it now comes in a white PlayStation version for use with the PS Remote Play app.Like the Razer Kishi, it turns any iPhone 6S or later into a Nintendo Switch-style gaming experience, with added smarts for social and chatty gamers. Like the Kishi, it connects via Lightning with pass-through charging but has no built-in battery. While the Kishi V2 is now more Backbone-like in its design (with better ergonomics) the Backbone controller still holds an advantage in the software department with a superior companion app.

OWC Envoy Pro Mini Other World Computing (OWC) makes a variety of computer accessories, many of them geared toward Apple users. While its Envoy Mini Pro pocket SSD can be formatted for use with both Macs and Windows PCs (ExFAT), it's really optimized for use with Macs (you choose how to format the drive when you plug it into your computer for the first time). It features both USB-C and USB-A connectivity and has a nifty design that's a more sophisticated take on your typical thumbdrive. The 500GB version with transfer speeds of up to 946 MB/s costs a little less than $100 while the 1TB version is closer to $145. You can find mini SSDs that cost less but many of those offer slower transfer speeds.

Logitech MX Anywhere 3S As is typical for a Logitech "S" product update, the compact MX Anywhere 3S wireless "mobile" mouse doesn't look any different from its predecessor. It offers some performance upgrades, notably quieter operation and an upgraded 8,000 DPI optical sensor that Logitech says tracks on most surfaces including glass and offers faster workflow with high-resolution monitors. While those with larger hands may prefer something a little bigger, the MX Anywhere 3S is an excellent mouse for both at-home and travel use. It comes in three colors.  Read our Logitech MX Master 3 first take.

Huano Magno Module Magnetic Laptop Stand Huano's Magno Module Magentic Laptop Stand folds flat into a slim package that you can slip into a backpack or laptop bag. There are four pieces to it: a wrist rest, magnetic iPhone stand, laptop stand and the base itself, which everything else sticks to thanks to the various integrated magnets. To get the stand to sit at various angles, it's a bit of an origami puzzle, but I eventually settled on a set-up I liked. You can also configure the stand to accommodate a tablet. A carry pouch is included.

Anker 735 3-Port GaNPrime 65W USB-C charger Anker's upgraded compact charger can charge a MacBook Pro 13 at full speed. Not only is it small for how much power it can deliver (it has foldable prongs), but it also has three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) that allow you to charge multiple devices at the same time. Be aware that power is split between the ports if you charge more than one device. It uses the next-generation GaN 3 technology.

Creative Labs Pebble X Creative Labs' Pebble speakers have long been a top budget pick for PC speakers. The entry-level model is on its third generation, aka V3 (see below), and costs $35, while earlier versions can be had for even less. They aren't the greatest-sounding PC speakers, but people like them because their sound is bigger than their price. Creative stepped up its game with the new-for-2024 Pebble X USB-C speakers ($90). They also offer a  Pebble X Plus version, which includes a mini subwoofer for $110. These speakers are larger than previous Pebble models but still compact enough to fit in a backpack. The sound quality is surprisingly good, making them possibly the best PC speakers available for under $100. Read our Creative Labs Pebble X review.

Logitech MX Keys Mini Logitech's MX Keys is one of our favorite everyday Bluetooth keyboards, and now it comes in two smaller versions that leave off the number pad and some other keys: MX Keys Mini and MX Keys Mini for Mac. Both cost around the same price as the standard MX Keys. Colors include rose, pale gray and graphite.  Read our Logitech MX Keys first take.

Oral B iO Series 5 This Oral-B electric toothbrush is similar to other Oral-B brushes, except the bristles on this brush felt softer than the step-up Oral-B Pro 1000. That's a big bonus for anyone with sensitive gums, as is the real-time coaching that tells you if you're brushing too hard. The Oral-B iO also has a quieter motor compared with the Pro 1000. The display offers an impressive amount of information. Based on the lit-up icon, you can easily tell what mode you're brushing in. The iO has five brush modes, whereas most electric toothbrushes have three or four. You can choose from daily clean, intense clean, whitening, sensitive and super sensitive. The Oral-B iO Series is also ADA-accepted.

Wush Pro by Black Wolf A while back, I took my kid to the doctor because he had a bunch of earwax built up in his ear and was having trouble hearing (yes, gross). The doctor was able to dislodge it with a pressurized stream of water, which is exactly what devices like the Wush Pro by Black Wolf deliver. Designed to be used in the shower, the Wush Pro does indeed work to remove earwax buildup. For people who have sensitive ears, it can be a little disconcerting to use at first, but read the instructions carefully and start at a lower setting before ramping things up (there are three pressure settings, and the Wush is equipped with a rechargeable battery). The pump inside does make some noise and is a little irritating, but it's tolerable and beats a visit to the doctor.

Philips Norelco Compact Travel Shaver The Philips Norelco Compact Travel Shaver isn't the most powerful electric shaver but it fits in your pocket, is nicely designed, has floating heads, long battery life and can be used dry or wet -- including in the shower. I wouldn't use this as my everyday razor (electric razors aren't great for those with sensitive skin), but as Philips says, it's good for touch ups on the go. My only complaint is that I wish it recharged with a USB-C cable instead of Philips' proprietary charging cable, but at least it doesn't require frequent charging.

Panasonic ER-GK80 Body Groomer Whoever you're getting this for may be a little embarrassed, but will most likely appreciate it in the end. Panasonic says this groomer has a unique V-shaped head that's "built to go everywhere" -- and with precision. It comes with two attachments, has almost 2 hours of battery life, and can be used wet or dry. A travel case is included. It's an excellent manscaping device.The list price recently crept above $100, but we left it on this list as a bonus pick because it costs just a little more than $100.
