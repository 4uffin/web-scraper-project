Kitchen Gizmo Snap N' Strain clip-on colander Many home cooks have tried to balance a pot lid so that it's open just enough to pour water or oil through, but not enough to let the food fall out. Sometimes, it works -- often, it doesn't. This cool little gadget makes that entire process easier by clipping to the edge of your pot or pan and acting like a colander to strain off liquid without losing the most important part -- your delicious food.

Japanese Kit Kat variety pack
Did you know that Kit Kats in other countries taste very different from American Kit Kats? It's true, and Japan takes it to a whole new level with tons of different flavors, including apple, orange -- even sweet potato. This variety pack may seem a little pricey for candy bars, but if you have a chocolate lover in your life, they will likely appreciate this as a gift.

Newlam Kalimba thumb piano My son loves to play the piano, but it isn't the easiest thing to carry around. This fun little Kalimba lets him plink away at something that offers a small, but beautiful, sound when we're out and about and the urge to be musical strikes him.

Sunyrisy chunky knit throw blanket My wife loves a chunky knit throw. She says it's the perfect balance between warm and cozy, and it's lightweight. It looks great and comes in a variety of colors to complement the decor in your home. This is the perfect gift for someone who likes to snuggle up on the couch to watch their favorite shows.

Echo Dot (4th gen) hanger The Echo Dot is in just about every home in America, right? You can't seem to go anywhere without seeing two or three of them scattered around on people's desks or kitchen counters. They can be difficult to place if you have limited counter space. So I use this plug-in Echo Dot hanger, and it helps to declutter, especially as the cords and charging block fit neatly inside the hanger, too. For more on the fourth-gen Amazon Echo itself, it's our pick for the best smart speaker.

Vibes reusable ear plugs If you spend any time at concerts, in loud public spaces or even the theater, you’ll know that the sound can become overwhelming. These earplugs from Vibes are super lightweight, easy to reuse and reduce the incoming noise level without muffling the sounds. I was at a concert up near the front, and the Vibes killed a lot of the excess noise without me losing the vocals or guitar shredding.

Senseo 25-piece drawer organizer set This is one of the many cases of "TikTok made me buy it" that you'll see while looking for gifts this year. My wife and I ended up buying several sets of these to organize everything from our pantry to our bathroom drawers. These kinds of organizers aren't the first thing people think of to buy themselves, which makes them a great gift.

D&D Starter Kit: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle I'm an avid tabletop gamer and I love giving these starter kits out to friends and family. Many people want to learn about Dungeons & Dragons but don't know where to begin. This box has everything you need to start your first adventure. Imagination is the key to a good D&D campaign, but you also need rules and dice. This set gives you both.

CMY Cube (50mm) Seeing the CMY Cube in person for the first time is almost magical. On the surface, it's a glass cube with the colors of cyan, magenta and yellow -- hence the name CMY Cube -- but as you spin it around, the colors mix, showing you more colors in the spectrum. I'm sure there are a lot of benefits to teaching color theory, and I know that it can help stimulate children with learning difficulties, but my main reason for giving this as a gift is its sheer joy. It's a simple cube that fires my imagination -- and I love it.

Baby Alive super snacks doll Children have been obsessed with dolls that pee and poop for years, and these dolls are among my daughter's favorites. They come with a few tubs of Play-Doh that you can use to make food in the little press, then you can feed the doll that food and easily take it out from the back of the doll afterward. If you don't mix food and water, it should stay clean for as long as your toddler wants to play with it.

ShakeSphere tumbler This is ideal for the protein shake fanatics in your life -- and it's also nice to look at. Although it doesn't have a blade, it's still able to puree soft fruits. (Pro tip: The riper and smaller the pieces, the better.) Plus, it made CNET's pick for the best protein shakers.

Zojirushi stainless steel travel mug This is perfect for someone who wants a travel mug that keeps their drinks hot for hours. When CNET's Pamela Vachon was testing travel mugs, she said this one was "the top performer in every possible metric." (She even filled it up and put it in an overnight bag -- and no spillage. The lid lock works.) This item also made our pick for the best overall travel mug.

Asakuki Smart Wi-Fi essential oil diffuser If you know someone who loves the spa -- or at least all its fragrant scents, like eucalyptus and lavender -- this is for them. Plus, they can power it from their smart speaker, like Amazon Echo or Google Home. This model also made CNET's pick for the best essential oil diffuser.

Anker Nano II 65W Over the last few years, phone makers have stopped including charging bricks with new phone purchases. It makes sense, but it means people are using outdated chargers that can't keep up with their phone's maximum charging speed. Make sure your loved ones have a power brick worthy of the latest and greatest device with this fast 65-watt charger from Anker. It's way faster than those offered by almost any standard manufacturer.

Tribit XSound Go A portable wireless speaker is a great gift for the music lover in your life. The Tribit XSound Go is one of our top choices for a budget-friendly Bluetooth speaker. It offers surprisingly good sound for its size and price, and it's fully waterproof.

GoDice D20 No matter how good virtual tabletop games get, using a physical die to resolve a tense roll just feels better. I used to point my webcam into a dice box so everyone online could see the roll happen, but with a GoDice D20, I don't have to. This smart die connects to my phone and shares my die roll with Roll20, FoundryVTT and even Discord. All you need to do is log in to your tabletop gaming app of choice and connect your GoDice, and the roll in real life quickly becomes a roll in the virtual space. It also lights up in fun colors when you hit a 20 or a 1, making it extra fun for the people in the room with you too.

Clorox tabletop air purifier This little tabletop air purifier is small enough to not be intrusive but large enough to filter a good-sized room twice an hour. It can remove animal dander and can significantly reduce mold spores, viruses and bacteria in the air. If you know someone who works from home in a stuffy office all day, this little device can make them feel a lot better.

Govee smart light bars These smart lights from Govee will add an ambient light behind your
giftee's TV or gaming rig -- and can even move to the music. With the Govee app, they can select the color and brightness they'd like. Govee has managed to build a strong reputation for delivering excellent quality products on a budget, and these lights show why. They feel a lot more expensive than they are and your gift recipient is sure to be impressed.

Groove Life belt with magnetic buckle A good belt is an investment. I know that seems overblown, but it's true. I have some really good belts that I've owned for 20 years, and they're still going strong. The Groove Life belt feels like that. The buckle on the one I tested is a walnut veneer that looks great and the magnetic clasp holds everything together tightly. The belt material is tough but has a little give. The stretch isn't so much that your pants fall down if you have heavy stuff in your pockets, but it has enough room to breathe when that meal is a little bigger than you thought.

GoCube Playing games with your kids can be incredibly rewarding, and so can playing games by yourself. The GoCube gives you the chance to do both. I've always wanted to know how to complete a Rubik's cube, but could never get the hang of it. The GoCube connects to your phone or tablet and takes you through the steps of solving a cube using "algorithms." It's the first time I've felt I had a handle on manipulating a puzzle cube without it being completely random. Learning a new skill as a dad, especially one that can impress your kids, is always worthwhile -- and the app even lets you play battle games with your kids to make it more family-oriented.

Silonn ice maker I think we can all agree that ice-cold drinks are delicious. This little ice maker is incredibly easy to operate, and because it doesn't tap directly into your water line, you can put it anywhere. All you have to do is fill it with bottled or filtered water and it will make delicious clear ice -- in two different sizes, no less -- whenever you need it.

Victrola portable suitcase Bluetooth record player Vinyl records never really go out of fashion, as they give an audio experience that's hard to match in today's digital age. Victrola makes a line of budget-friendly vinyl players that keep that retro feel while adding in some modern smarts, like Bluetooth connectivity. The onboard sound is only average, the outputs let you connect it to a proper set of speakers that offer a rich and enjoyable sound.

TerraFlame s'mores roaster If you know someone who loves s'mores all year round, this is an excellent choice. This beautiful gel-fueled fire pit can be used indoors or out, it's really perfect for indoor use. The gel fuel is odorless and doesn't release any toxic fumes into the air, so they can roast up their fill of marshmallows, no matter what the weather is like outside. If you want to couple this gift with a similar one, check out our choices for smokeless fire pits.

Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 (Update: Out of Stock) Jabra bills the Elite 8 Active as the "world's toughest earbuds," and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. They include an LE Audio smart case, allowing wireless streaming from any device with a USB-C or 3.5mm port. I tested it with an inflight entertainment and it worked well, with no audio lag. The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also features enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio "for a better music experience," enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors, and improved noise-canceling performance. Read our Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 first take.

Meater 2 Plus The first time I saw the Meater 2 Plus, I knew I had to use it. I live in southern California, and the weather is pretty much always good enough to throw a rack of ribs or a spatchcock chicken on the grill. I do a lot of cooking out in the backyard, but it takes a long time to cook. You really want to cook slowly and evenly on a grill to keep the juices in. The Meater 2 Plus lets me put the temperature probe into the meat, close the grill lid and maintain a connection to my phone. Not only is the connection tremendous, but if you tell the app what meat you're cooking, it can work out the resting time too, giving you a perfect piece of meat every time. The update to the Meater 2 means it can be much closer to the heat, including deep frying turkeys.Read more: Meater 2 Plus hands-on

RayNeo Pocket TV If, like me, you get fed up with the terrible choices on hotel TVs, and you want something you can travel with that has all your settings already, try the Pocket TV from RayNeo. Originally designed to work with the RayNeo Smart glasses, the output is just USB-C, meaning it will work with any USB-C monitor or, if you have a USB-C to HDMI cable, any standard TV. The Pocket TV is Google TV-powered, meaning it's easy to navigate. It also has 64GB storage and room for an SD card, so you can save your shows for offline travel on a plane. I've used it a lot with the RayNeo glasses and it's a fantastic little ecosystem for watching your favorite shows privately while traveling.

Headphones
Beats Studio Pro If you know someone who's always wanted a pair of Beats headphones, then these are the perfect gift. The battery life is up to 24 hours (ANC on) and 40 hours (ANC off). They’re also our pick for best Beats headphones, and as CNET’s David Carnoy says, “I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max.” You be the judge. Read our Beats Studio Pro review to learn more about their sound quality and performance.

Hatch Restore 2 Help your giftee wake up more naturally -- versus a blaring beep-beep-beep -- with this sunrise alarm clock. They can customize things like the light options (how bright a sunrise would they like?), as well as the sounds they wake up to (like singing birds) and fall asleep to (soothing rain, anyone?). Plus, it can even help you form better sleep habits by decompressing with one of the many ambient sounds from Hatch. This model also made CNET's pick for best sunrise alarm clock.

Yamaha Audio YAS-209BL soundbar For that gadget-obsessed person in your life who seems to have everything, consider a soundbar. This Yamaha model is an optimal choice for boosting the quality of the sound from their TV or gaming system. With Alexa built-in, this smart soundbar can stream all their favorite music, TV shows and movies, not to mention the amazing sound it delivers for video games. It also received our Editors' Choice Award for best soundbar.
