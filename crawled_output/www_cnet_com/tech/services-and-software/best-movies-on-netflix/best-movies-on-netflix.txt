Searchlight Pictures
In the 10 years since releasing its first original film, Beasts of No Nation, Netflix has evolved into a power player in the movie scene. It's earned honors at award shows including the Oscars, Golden Globes and Emmys. The streaming giant won three Oscars in 2025, and action-thriller Rebel Ridge just nabbed an Emmy Award for Best TV Movie. Popular films like KPop Demon Hunters, which is now the platform's most-watched movie ever, have also helped make it a reliable destination for hits. Whether you love drama, comedy, blockbusters or quiet, independent films, check out what we consider to be the best movies you can watch on Netflix right now. We'll let you know what new films have just dropped, and whether or not something is leaving the platform. To that end, you'll want to catch The Departed, Friday Night Lights and the Mission: Impossible films before they leave at the end of September, and check out 28 Days Later which just arrived last week.If you'd rather go with a series, peruse our picks for the best TV shows to watch on Netflix.Read more: Where to Watch All the 2024 Oscar WinnersWatch movies at Netflix
Searchlight Pictures
28 Days Later (2002)
28 Days Later has been on a lot of people's watch lists as a result of the recent premiere of it's long-awaited follow-up 28 Years Later. The 2002 original stars Cillian Murphy as a bike messenger who awakens from a coma to find that Britain has been ravaged by zombie-like creatures infected with a rare virus. Netflix had the good sense to acquire 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, which have both just dropped on the platform so we can have a proper zombie marathon. (You can check out 28 Weeks Later on Hulu.)
Netflix
Rebel Ridge (2024)
Netflix original Rebel Ridge snagged an Emmy this year for Best Television Movie. The action film stars Aaron Pierre as an ex-Marine who, in an attempt to post bail for his cousin, has the bail money stolen by corrupt cops, and the ordeal turns into an action-packed, thrilling showdown. Don Johnson has evolved from playing suave cops like Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice to morally compromised officers of the law these days, and in Rebel Ridge, he's earned accolades for playing a wickedly corrupt Louisiana police chief at the heart of the film.
Netflix
KPop Demon Hunters (2025)
The Netflix original animated film KPop Demon Hunters premiered in June and has already risen through the ranks to become the platform's most-watched original film of all time. The film, about a KPop group that performs by day and hunts demons in their downtime, features tons of great original music and stars Arden Cho, May Hong and Ji Young Yoo as the titular girl group tasked with fighting off a demonic boy band. (And the recently released theatrical sing-along version is also available to stream, too.)
Netflix
Will & Harper (2024)
Will Ferrell and Harper Steele star in the Netflix original documentary Will & Harper as two longtime friends reconnecting on a road trip as they address Steele's transition to life as a woman. The film doesn't gloss over the hate Steele receives for her appearance and desire to live authentically, and Ferrell tempers his comedic persona to serve as Steeles supportive friend who isn't afraid to ask often uncomfortable questions. The film has won a Peabody Award and was nominated for an Emmy in 2025.
Netflix
Nonnas (2025)
Vince Vaughn stars in the Netflix original film Nonnas as a man who decides to open an Italian restaurant to honor his mother and grandmother who have passed. He hires a crew of older Italian women, the titular nonnas (played by Susan Sarandon, Talia Shire, Lorraine Bracco and Brenda Vaccaro), to cook and share their recipes to keep their traditions -- and the memory of their loved ones -- alive.
Universal Pictures/The Weinstein Company
Inglourious Basterds (2009)
One of Quentin Tarantino's best, Inglourious Basterds is an alternate
World War II history that reimagines what would have happened if a group
of American soldiers carried out a plot to assassinate a group of Nazis
in Paris during the war. The film co-stars Brad Pitt, Michael
Fassbender, Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger, and it won Christoph Waltz
an Oscar for his darkly comedic portrayal of Austrian SS officer Hans
Landa.
Universal Pictures
Jurassic Park (1993)
With this year's release of Jurassic World Rebirth, there's no better time to revisit the original Jurassic Park film directed by Steven Spielberg. The film, which just arrived to Netflix along with The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III, was an immediate blockbuster when it first came out in 1993 and has become a part of the pop culture lexicon in the years since. (And where would Jeff Goldblum be without it?)
Warner Bros.
The Departed (2006)
It's almost impossible to choose which of Martin Scorsese's films is his best, but The Departed is the only one that (finally) won him an Academy Award for best director. Loosely based on real-life Boston criminals like Whitey Bulger, the film stars Jack Nicholson as Frank Costello, a mob boss who plants an informant within the Massachusetts State Police. Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Vera Farmiga and Martin Sheen co-star in the film that will be... departing Netflix on Sept. 30.
Paramount Pictures
Clueless (1995)
Clueless, which premiered in 1995, is one of the great teen films of all time. The outfits! The music! The endlessly quotable script! The comedy, which stars Alicia Silverstone as the seemingly vapid LA teen Cher Horowitz, is based loosely on Jane Austen's novel Emma and arrived on Netflix on Aug. 1. We're totally buggin'.
Universal Pictures
Jaws (1975)
It's a big year for Jaws; the Steven Spielberg classic is celebrating its 50th anniversary and to commemorate, the film (and its three sequels) arrived on Netflix last month. The film, which starred Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw as three men on the hunt for a killer shark off the beaches of a New England town, has it all: thrills, impeccable performances and a score by John Williams that might be one of cinema's most memorable ever.
Netflix
The Old Guard (2020)
Based on the comic book by Greg Rucka, the action-fantasy The Old Guard stars Charlize Theron as one of a group of immortal mercenaries who are able to regenerate even after being killed. When they're tracked down and hunted by a pharmaceutical company that intends to study them, they fight back in an effort to protect themselves. The first film, released in 2020, was such a success that a sequel, The Old Guard 2, premiered earlier this summer and features Uma Thurman as Theron's newest adversary.
David James/Paramount Pictures
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)
Netflix just released the first five movies in the Mission: Impossible franchise and while we really enjoy them all, 2015's Rogue Nation is one of our favorites. Rogue Nation was the first in the franchise directed by Tom Cruise's frequent collaborator Christopher McQuarrie, and it introduced Rebecca Ferguson's ex-MI6 agent Ilsa Faust alongside Cruise's Ethan Hunt. All five M:I films arrived on Netflix this summer, but they've got a short shelf life -- catch them before they leave on Sept. 30.
Universal Pictures
Friday Night Lights (2004)
Peter Berg's 2004 drama Friday Night Lights spawned one of the great shows of the early aughts but the film stands on its own as a sports classic. Billy Bob Thornton stars as Odessa, Texas, football coach Gary Gaines, whose high school team is more than just a sports club; they're the soul of the town. After the team's star player (Derek Luke) is injured, Gaines has to restore morale and spirit not just within his team but in the entire community.The film is leaving on Sept. 30, so check it out while you can.
Sony Pictures
One of Them Days (2025)
One of Them Days is pure comedy gold. It's the perfect (R-rated) film when you're looking for something silly and fun and packed with great jokes and performances. The movie is part of the "desperate best friends embark on a mission with a deadline" genre (see also: Booksmart, Plan B) as best friends Dreux (Kiki Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA in her film debut) try to track down the rent money that was stolen by Alyssa's boyfriend before the end of the day. When they realize the money is gone, they desperately try to make all the money they need in one day, leading them to sell a pair of stolen Jordans and stage an art show to sell some of Alyssa's paintings. The film, which arrived on Netflix in March, features hilarious cameos from Katt Williams, Janelle James and Lil Rel Howery. Rumor has it a sequel is in the works.
ESPN
30 for 30: June 17, 1994 (2010)
30 for 30, the great ESPN documentary franchise, has put out dozens of great movies that cover some of the most incredible stories in sports, some of them overlooked and others focused on specific, infamous moments in history. One of the best films to come out of the series is the 2010 documentary June 17, 1994, a date that is remembered by many as the day of O.J. Simpson's police chase in a white Ford Bronco. The televised chase would have been notorious enough but what the doc points out is that that date was a huge moment across several sports. Many of those moments, including Game 5 of that year's NBA Finals, Arnold Palmer's final appearance on the PGA tour and Ken Griffey Jr. tying Babe Ruth's home run record were interrupted by one of the most famous live news broadcasts in history.
A24
Past Lives (2023)
Past Lives is the directorial debut from Celine Song, who also wrote the film. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo star as friends Nora and Hae Sung who met as children in South Korea but lost touch after Nora's family relocated to Canada. After reconnecting, the two friends explore their friendship and wonder what might have been had Nora never left. The film was nominated for best picture at the 2024 Oscars.
DreamWorks Animation
The Croods (2013)
Modern animated classics are a thing and The Croods is one of those DreamWorks movies that hits you with laughs, emotions and subtle contemplation. Teenage Eep is tired of her dad's (Grug) strict rules and sneaking out exposes her to someone new. New is an overall theme here in a story about the cave-dwelling Croods when they encounter disaster and are forced to find a new place to live. Grug doesn't always welcome learning new things from a human and Eep's curious, sometimes rebellious ways also contribute to family disagreements. If you like animated comedies with a touch of family sentimentality, stream The Croods and then the spinoff series, Dawn of the Croods.
Yoo Eun Mi/Netflix
Ballerina (2023)
Netflix's K-drama collection has a few hidden gems, including Ballerina, a 2023 revenge story about a former bodyguard seeking justice for her friend. Jang Ok-ju stops at nothing to make the offenders pay in this action-packed thriller. (Just don't get this Ballerina confused with the recent release of the same name starring Ana de Armas, which is also an action-packed revenge story -- that one's not on Netflix, at least not yet.)
Lewis Jacobs/Netflix
Rez Ball (2024)
A powerful story about a high school basketball team in New Mexico, Rez Ball takes viewers on a journey with the Chuska Warriors. When a tragic event strikes the team, it faces challenges on and off the court -- but still aims for a championship title. Co-written by Sydney Freeland and Sterlin Harjo (co-creator of Reservation Dogs), the movie is based on the novel Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation.
Neon
Parasite (2019)
Director Bong Joon-ho's dark, psychological thriller Parasite won the Oscar for best picture in 2019 (along with the awards for best director, best original screenplay and best international feature). The film, about a poor family who infiltrates the home and lives of a wealthy family, was recently named the best film of the 21st century in a New York Times poll of filmmakers and actors.
Netflix
Hit Man (2024)
The 2024 action comedy was one of several movies starring Glen Powell that helped cement his leading-man status. The film, co-written by Powell and director Richard Linklater, stars Powell as a nerdy professor drawn into an undercover investigation. Disguising himself as a hitman, he adopts a new persona for each client -- until he falls for a woman (Adria Arjona) who hires him to kill her abusive husband.
Netflix
My Octopus Teacher (2020)
2020's My Octopus Teacher won an Oscar for best documentary feature for telling a personal and poignant story of the friendship between a man and an octopus he meets while diving. Filmed over the course of a year, Craig Foster documented the kinship he formed with the octopus who would repeatedly and playfully approach him. The film explores the often unseen personality of a creature found in the wild who ends up giving Foster insight into nature and his own relationships. If you're inspired by the natural world, the film's director Pippa Ehrlich's follow-up feature, Pangolin: Kulu's Journey, is on Netflix now, too.
Netflix
Carry-On (2024)
In Carry-On, which arrived on Netflix in December, Taron Egerton plays Ethan Kopek, a TSA agent who is being blackmailed by a mysterious traveler (played by Jason Bateman) into allowing a dangerous package through security and onto a flight on Christmas Eve, endangering everyone aboard. The film is a thrilling game of cat-and-mouse and has proven so popular that it's currently Netflix's third most popular original movie of all time.
Netflix
Martha (2024)
Martha Stewart is somehow simultaneously elusive and completely accessible in her Netflix documentary Martha. Although she's spent much of her life -- a highly curated, seemingly perfect one -- in the spotlight, Stewart opens up about her most intimate and sometimes controversial moments, from a marital affair to her imprisonment for insider trading. Yet, she always manages to come out on top.
Netflix
Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl (2024)
Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is the latest film from Aardman animation studio, starring the beloved dog and his hapless, cheese-loving master. The Netflix original film about a robotic garden gnome that wreaks havoc on the man and his best friend arrived to the platform recently and received an Oscar nomination this year for best animated feature.Watch Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl on Netflix
Netflix
The Only Girl In The Orchestra (2024)
The Only Girl in the Orchestra won an Oscar this year for best documentary short and you can catch the 35-minute film exclusively on Netflix. The film is the story of Orin O'Brien, the first woman hired to perform in the New York Philharmonic (by Leonard Bernstein, no less). Often ogled for her looks and singled out for attention because of her gender, she rose above it all, staying true to her creative principles to become one of the orchestra's most renowned musicians for decades.Watch The Only Girl in the Orchestra on Netflix
Netflix
1917 (2019)
1917, the critically lauded, Oscar-winning film directed by Sam Mendes about World War I was remarkable for the fact that it was filmed with the intent of making it appear as though the entire movie was shot as two long, continuous takes. The movie stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman as British soldiers traveling across a dangerous battle zone rigged by Germans in an effort to deliver a message to their superiors, warning them of an impending attack. The film's stellar supporting cast includes Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Richard Madden.
Netflix
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)
Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is dedicated to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, who made his final screen appearance in the film before his death in 2020. The film stars Boseman as Levee Green, a member of blues singer Ma Rainey's band (Viola Davis), and takes place amid one of the band's conflict-ridden and turbulent recording sessions in 1920s Chicago. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play.Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on Netflix
Netflix
His Three Daughters (2024)
Genre: DramaRating: RIn His Three Daughters, Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen star as three estranged sisters who come together in their dying father's small New York apartment to care for him in his last days. Writer-director Azazel Jacobs coaxes some incredible performances out of each actress for this intimate, emotional and often funny study of family dynamics. Watch His Three Daughters on Netflix
Netflix
Rustin (2023)
Colman Domingo earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in this film about a man whose legacy has often been overlooked in civil rights history. Bayard Rustin fought alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and the Freedom Rides, among other major historic events. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. The film explores the life of a man whose legacy has long been overlooked.Watch Rustin on Netflix
Netflix
Always Be My Maybe (2019)
Always Be My Maybe stars Ali Wong and Randall Park as Sasha and Marcus, childhood best friends who grew up next door to one another in San Francisco. The two fall out after attempting the whole "friends with benefits" thing as teens but 15 years later they reunite -- uncomfortably -- when Sasha returns to her hometown for work. As Marcus struggles with his feelings for Sasha, she goes off and dates Keanu Reeves (playing a hilariously over-the-top version of himself), as she tries to figure out how she feels about her old friend. Charming and sweet, the film is a rom-com that's reliably funny thanks to its leads and excellent supporting performances from Michelle Buteau, Vivian Bang and Reeves.Watch Always Be My Maybe on Netflix
Netflix
Maestro (2023)
This biographical film nabbed seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Picture. Maestro tells the story of conductor Leonard Bernstein (Bradley Cooper) and his relationship with actor Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan). In addition to starring in the romance drama, Cooper also directed and co-wrote the film and produced it alongside Hollywood legends Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg.Watch Maestro on Netflix
Toho
Godzilla Minus One (2023)
Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. Set in 1945, the story centers around Kōichi Shikishima, a young pilot dealing with PTSD in a post-World War II era. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. The Sony film is available to stream on Netflix now.Watch Godzilla Minus One on Netflix
Netflix

The Greatest Night in Pop (2024)
If you weren't around at the time, it's hard to explain just how huge We
Are the World was. Recorded by a supergroup of popular
musicians -- assembled on the fly on the night of the 1985 American Music
Awards -- the charity single benefiting Ethiopian famine victims sold more than
20 million copies and featured the likes of Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross. (It feels impossible to imagine so many mega-stars assembling in one room for something like this today.) Luckily for us, there were
cameras rolling the entire time as dozens of the world's most famous
musicians pulled the epic all-night recording session. The recently
departed Quincy Jones proves to be the night's true star, wrangling a studio
full of nerves, egos and a little too much wine to produce something
genuinely special.Watch The Greatest Night in Pop on Netflix

Nyad (2023)
Annette Bening and Jodie Foster both scored Oscar nominations (for best actress and best supporting actress) for their roles in Nyad, the Netflix original film about marathon swimmer Diana Nyad and her devoted coach Bonnie Stoll. The remarkable true story is not a full biopic but a chapter of Nyad's accomplished life when, at the age of 60, Nyad
became obsessed with completing the arduous, near-impossible 110-mile swim from Cuba to Florida. Determined to become the first person to finish the
swim without a shark cage, the film is a story of Nyad's determination, ushered along by the support of those closest to her.Watch Nyad on Netflix

Untold is Netflix's answer to ESPN's 30 for 30 and the documentary series features dozens of fascinating behind-the-scenes stories from the world of sports.
