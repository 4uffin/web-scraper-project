The 45th edition of golf's biggest tournament takes place this weekend. Team USA will be looking to prevent Team Europe from claiming a first Ryder Cup win on American turf since 2012's "Miracle at Medinah."Keep reading to find out the best live TV streaming services you can use to watch each day of the tournament live. This year's installment of the biennial event sees Team USA skippered by Keegan Bradley. He will hope that home advantage, as well as having world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, will be enough to extend the lead over Europe to 27 wins to the visitors' 15, with just two ties in the tournament's history.Team Europe, meanwhile, is once again captained by Luke Donald and boasts a line-up including 2025 Masters winner Rory McIlroy and LIV Golf big hitter Jon Rahm. The tourists have reportedly prepared for the abuse they are expecting from the rowdy, partisan home crowd by using VR headsets.Hosting the tournament for the first time -- and marking the first occasion the Ryder Cup has been staged in New York -- the Black Course at Bethpage State Park is a notoriously difficult A.W. Tillinghast-designed public-access layout. Its narrow fairways and punishing roughs are set to heighten the drama of golf's most fiercely contested competition.Keep reading to find out the best live TV streaming services to use to watch each day of the tournament live, wherever you are in the world.
Should Team USA win this weekend, it won't get to keep the Ryder Cup trophy. As is tradition, it will instead be presented with a replica, with the original staying at the headquarters of the European Tour at the Wentworth Club in England. Gary Kellner/PGA of America
