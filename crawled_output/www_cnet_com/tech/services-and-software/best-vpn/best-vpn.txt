How we test
We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability.
Factors to consider in a VPN
Internet speed loss
VPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less, which shouldn’t be noticeable even on slower connections. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%.
Privacy
VPNs bolster your privacy by encrypting your connection and masking your IP address. Look for features like kill switches and DNS leak protection as well as strict no-logging policies backed up by third-party audits and transparency reports. Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or 14 Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind.
Server network
When considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. At the high end, the most comprehensive VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks. Additionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, like Tor (The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers that offer additional privacy.
Device support
Think about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on. Most VPN companies offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. You can typically install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps, like Xbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the router. Most VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. Most folks should be fine even with eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may feel constrained.
Streaming capabilities
VPNs can be great for privacy, but they're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock, Max or Hulu from your home country when traveling abroad. On the flip side, VPNs unlock access to foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries.

Why we like it ExpressVPN retains its Editors’ Choice award for the best VPN overall thanks in large part to how the company continues to improve and innovate year after year. The company consistently demonstrates a solid commitment to privacy and transparency, and continuously shows that it’s dedicated to driving the industry forward and pushing the boundaries of what a VPN can do.    In addition to being a top choice for privacy-conscious VPN users, ExpressVPN is a fantastic option for casual users because it’s extremely simple to use, fast and excellent for streaming. The VPN also now has servers in all 50 of the United States, making it great for getting around regional sports blackouts.However, ExpressVPN is also one of the most expensive VPNs on the market, even after a major price overhaul in September 2025 that we were hoping would make the service more attractive to budget-conscious users. The company’s new Basic tier includes only the VPN plus a stripped-down version of its Advanced Protection offering and costs $13 per month -- which is pretty standard for the industry. But the yearly subscription costs $75 for the first 15 months and renews at $100 annually, and the two-year subscription now costs $98 total for the first 28 months and renews annually at the same $100 rate. That’s still pretty steep for just a VPN, no matter how good it is.

Contrast that with Surfshark, whose base VPN plan offers unlimited simultaneous connections, a fuller feature set (including extras like Alternative ID) and costs $48 for the first 15 months and renews at $79 annually thereafter. But if you’re looking to bundle additional services with your VPN, ExpressVPN’s Advanced tier may even be a better value than NordVPN’s basic VPN-only plan, offering many more features at a similar intro price and lower renewal price.  Also featured inFastest VPNs, Best VPN for StreamingExpressVPN speedsWe measured an 18% average speed loss in our latest speed tests with ExpressVPN thanks to upgrades to its connection protocols, making Express the third-fastest VPN we tested this year. As long as your base internet speeds aren’t a slow crawl, you’ll have no issues streaming, gaming, torrenting or hopping on video calls while connected to ExpressVPN.ExpressVPN cooked up inventive solutions on both Lightway and OpenVPN protocols on its latest Windows app. With the introduction of Lightway Turbo, ExpressVPN is now able to run your connection through multiple tunnels simultaneously, allowing for more data to be sent at once and significantly boosting speeds. With OpenVPN on Windows, ExpressVPN implemented Data Channel Offload, which boosts speeds by handling data packets more efficiently. In our testing, speed loss through Lightway went from 40% in January 2025 to 17% in March, and 64% to 18% through OpenVPN over the same period, following ExpressVPN’s speed upgrades. Privacy and transparencyFew VPN providers do privacy and transparency as well as ExpressVPN. The company’s industry-leading 23 independent audits since 2018 leave other VPN providers in the dust and demonstrate its strong commitment to being as transparent as possible. A 2025 audit by KPMG concluded that ExpressVPN’s TrustedServer technology works as advertised and in accordance with the company’s privacy policy.In addition to being one of the most transparent VPNs, ExpressVPN is a privacy leader that continues to consistently roll out innovative privacy improvements on top of basic features that work as expected. It was one of the first VPN providers to implement post-quantum protections, which help protect against potential future threats from quantum computers. And as postquantum security standards have evolved, ExpressVPN has kept pace with those changes by integrating ML-KEM to beef up its postquantum protections. In August, the company rolled out its own implementation of WireGuard with post-quantum encryption and published a white paper detailing the process for other VPN providers to follow. ExpressVPN’s Shuffle IP feature is another privacy enhancement that works in the background and automatically assigns you a different IP address for each site you visit, making it even more difficult to track you online.UsabilityThanks to ExpressVPN’s simple interface and consistent user experience across platforms, there’s practically no learning curve, making ExpressVPN an ideal choice for beginners. You’ll get apps for Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV Stick and even a GUI app for Linux. ExpressVPN’s new mobile apps for Android and iOS add a few useful elements that make toggling settings and selecting server locations more intuitive. We also like the new themes that let you customize the look of the app.   If you want an excellent VPN for streaming, it’s tough to beat ExpressVPN. In our latest tests, we had no issues accessing content from a variety of streaming sites, including Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Max and Amazon Prime Video across all devices we tested. You can connect up to 10 devices simultaneously with ExpressVPN, which should be enough for most users. ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you have the opportunity to try the service before fully committing.

Why we like it NordVPN remains the fastest VPN we tested, making it an excellent choice for bandwidth-intensive activities such as 4K video streaming, competitive online gaming or file sharing on remote teams. The versatile NordVPN does just about everything well, from its fantastic content unblocking to its advanced privacy features. If you primarily want a VPN for activities like streaming video or competitive gaming, NordVPN should be your first choice. But Express barely edges out Nord for usability and privacy, and VPNs like Surfshark and Mullvad will be easier on your wallet.It’s initially a great value at $13 per month, $60 annually or $83 total for the first two years of service, but aggressive price hikes on the one- and two-year plans drive the renewal up to $140 per year, which is about the highest you can pay for a VPN. Thankfully, you can save money on your VPN service by stacking subscriptions, meaning you can buy a discounted NordVPN plan at Black Friday and add that to your existing account to avoid an exorbitant price hike.Also featured inBest VPN for Netflix, Best VPN for Streaming

NordVPN speedsIn our 2025 speed tests, NordVPN emerged as the uncontested fastest VPN with a 3% average internet download speed loss. We find anything under an average 25% download speed loss perfectly acceptable, so Nord’s blisteringly fast server performance should be virtually unnoticeable. Its proprietary WireGuard-based NordLynx VPN protocol delivered the best performance, with a mere 11% average speed loss on Windows compared to a still-solid 21% speed loss on the slower OpenVPN. On MacOS, both NordLynx and OpenVPN speed test results were faster than my base internet speed, which is extremely uncommon, but can happen in cases where internet providers are limiting bandwidth.Privacy and transparencyNordVPN ticks all of the privacy basics and then some, providing unique features for privacy-critical users. Although we’d like to see improvements in its privacy policy and more transparency about renewal prices, Nord is great for casual users who want to stream Netflix or BBC iPlayer and privacy-critical folks like investigative journalists alike. You’ll find standard options, like NordLynx and OpenVPN protocols, a kill switch and split tunneling. Additionally, Nord packs advanced privacy amenities including its NordWhisper VPN protocol, which tries to masquerade as standard web traffic in an attempt to hide the fact that you’re using a VPN. For enhanced privacy, you’ll find Onion Over VPN servers (which rely on Tor to make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to you) and double VPN servers (which beef up your privacy using a pair of VPN connections). The service continues to improve, with scam call protection on Android rolled out in July.There’s a strict no-logs policy that undergoes annual audits by a reputable third party. Its RAM-only servers reset after each VPN session, so theoretically, none of your browsing data should be saved to a disk anyway. For future-proofing, NordVPN rolled out post-quantum protection to all of its apps, which may guard against threats from quantum computers -- only a handful of VPN providers, including ExpressVPN, have post-quantum encryption. While Nord gets most things right, its privacy policy isn’t quite as reassuring as its main rival, ExpressVPN, especially regarding business transfers. Most folks shouldn’t be worried, but anyone with serious privacy concerns about having their user data transferred in the event of a merger may want to consider a different VPN provider.Usability Whether you’re a VPN beginner, seasoned privacy enthusiast or somewhere in between, you’ll find NordVPN’s apps intuitive. It’s easy to perform all essential tasks, like changing servers, switching VPN protocols or enabling different critical settings such as the kill switch. NordVPN offers apps for nearly every available platform, including Windows, MacOS, Linux (with a beginner-friendly GUI), Android, iOS/iPadOS, Apple TV, Android TV and the Amazon Fire TV. Visually, Nord’s app is busier compared to ExpressVPN’s minimalist app, but it’s not overwhelming or clunky like the PrivadoVPN and PIA apps. We wish split tunneling on Android were a little more flexible -- you can exclude individual apps from your VPN, but not use a VPN connection for only some apps. Still, that’s a minor quibble about an otherwise polished app.

Why we like it Surfshark is a solid option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly VPN experience that rivals higher-priced providers like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Its impressive roster of useful premium features delivers a lot of value even though the service has gotten more expensive. While it can’t quite keep up with NordVPN’s speed and ExpressVPN’s usability and overall privacy, it comes pretty close at a significantly cheaper cost than those two, especially when looking at renewal rates.Monthly pricing is the exception: Most VPNs charge about $10 to $13 for a monthly subscription, but Surfshark charges $15.45 per month, making it one of the most expensive monthly rates in the industry. Prices for Surfshark’s longer-term plans are much more reasonable. The one-year plan costs $48 for the first 15 months and renews at $79 per year thereafter. The two-year plan costs $60 for the first 27 months and renews annually at the same $79 rate. That’s significantly cheaper than the $100 that ExpressVPN charges and the $140 that NordVPN charges annually upon renewal.Also featured inBest Cheap VPNs, Best VPNs for Streaming

Surfshark speedsSurfshark’s overall speed performance has been remarkably consistent and fast over the past few years, with an average speed loss hovering in the high teens. In our most recent speed tests, we measured an average speed loss of 21%, which is speedy enough for us to consider it a fast VPN. Surfshark has a vast network of over 3,200 servers across 100 different countries, which can help ensure fast speeds and stable connections by minimizing congestion and offering more options for more users to connect to servers nearby their physical location.A new feature Surfshark calls FastTrack is an innovative solution that the company says can boost your VPN connection speeds by up to 70% on certain servers. The feature leverages Surfshark’s Nexus Network to optimize the path your connection takes to the exit server. This can result in faster speeds if connecting through multiple servers is more optimal than connecting directly. In our testing, FastTrack boosted our speeds by about 20%, but speed differences may be more pronounced for users on slower or less stable internet connections. For now, FastTrack is available on MacOS through Surfshark’s Seattle, Vancouver and Sydney server locations.Privacy and transparencySurfshark has cool privacy features in addition to standard privacy protections like its kill switch, no-logs policy and DNS leak protection. Surfshark’s Dynamic Multihop lets you tunnel through any two server locations for an added layer of privacy and its Rotating IP makes it harder to track you online by switching your IP address every few minutes. We also like Surfshark’s Alternative ID, a suite of unique privacy features that allows you to generate an alter-ego complete with full name, physical address, and email address that you can use online without divulging your true identity. An alternative phone number is also available for an extra $3 per month. Surfshark’s new EverLink “self-healing VPN infrastructure” is another one-of-a-kind innovation that works in the background to automatically reconfigure the VPN tunnel in case it unexpectedly breaks.  Surfshark also rolled out post-quantum protections this year to protect against potential future threats from quantum computers, a move that follows other top VPNs including ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Mullvad. We’re encouraged by Surfshark representatives telling us that the company is committing to an annual audit cadence. The latest no-logs audit from Deloitte found that the configuration of Surfshark’s IT systems are in line with its no-logs policy. Additionally, Surfshark publishes a quarterly transparency report, which details the number of legal requests the company receives each quarter and states that Surfshark has no useful information to disclose to authorities, in line with its no-logs policy.UsabilitySurfshark’s apps are slick, simple to use and deliver a consistent user experience across platforms. Apps are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Apple TV, Fire TV and Android TV. If you’re into streaming, Surfshark does well to unblock content on most platforms and streaming services and offers apps for smart TVs as well as streaming devices. We did experience slow loading times with Netflix on MacOS and Hulu detected the VPN when we tried streaming content on Hulu through Surfshark’s Fire TV Stick app. Otherwise, the streaming experience was solid and what we would expect from a top-tier VPN service. Surfshark is also a great choice if you live in a large household or have lots of connected devices because you’ll be able to connect an unlimited number of devices simultaneously, compared to competitors’ usual five to 10 limit. And like many other VPNs, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you’re not satisfied with the service.

Why we like it Proton VPN is the best free VPN, and the only zero-dollar virtual private network on the market that we wholeheartedly recommend. While Proton VPN’s free plan is excellent, its premium plan holds its own against the likes of ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark, and is a fantastic upgrade path for anyone who needs more servers for streaming and travel. Its nifty privacy features, like discreet app icons and guest modes, coupled with fast speeds and outstanding streaming service unblocking, make Proton VPN a solid option for casual users and privacy buffs alike. Proton also costs $60 for the first year or $108 for two years with a renewal price of $80 annually for the one- and two-year plans, making it cheaper than most competing VPNs, even if you’re paying the higher renewal price.Despite a few shortcomings with Proton’s free plan -- you can’t manually select a server, and you’re limited to one connection at a time -- it doesn’t sacrifice privacy, sell your data or plaster your screen with ads. By contrast, PrivadoVPN lets you pick a server on its free tier, but limits you to 10GB of monthly usage, which is barely enough for streaming a 4K movie. Moreover, Privado hasn’t been audited and doesn’t publish transparency reports, so unlike Proton VPN, it’s unsuitable for folks with serious privacy concerns. Also featured inBest Free VPN, Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video

Proton VPN speedsBoasting a blazing-fast 16% average internet download speed loss in our 2025 benchmarking, Proton VPN remained snappy even on geographically distant servers. Its performance falls comfortably under our recommended 25% average speed loss maximum, fitting between the pack-leading NordVPN (3%) and our best overall, ExpressVPN (18%). Regardless of the VPN protocol or server we used, Proton provided usable speeds for bandwidth-demanding activities like streaming ultra-high-definition videos or online gaming. Privacy and transparencyWhile Proton is great for casual users who want to stream Netflix or travel the world, its unique, helpful privacy features make it an outstanding choice for anyone with serious privacy concerns, like political activists. In addition to the industry-standard WireGuard and OpenVPN VPN protocols, Proton packs its proprietary Stealth protocol, which attempts to slip through firewalls disguised as normal web traffic. Stealth could be helpful in situations where VPNs are frowned upon, such as on school Wi-Fi or when traveling to certain countries. Like most VPN companies, Proton undergoes annual third-party audits, which have verified its no-logging policy, meaning the company isn’t collecting data about your online activity. Its privacy policy is also one of the most reader-friendly we’ve ever seen, directly addressing concerns about user data and privacy.Proton VPN’s discreet app icons let you hide the fact that you’ve got a VPN installed on your phone or tablet, making the Proton VPN app icon instead look like a notes or weather app. Proton's hidden app icons could prove helpful if you’re worried about your device getting seized and searched. For beefed-up privacy, you’ll find Secure Core servers, which use a second VPN connection, and Tor Over VPN servers, which use a VPN in conjunction with The Onion Router. Both Secure Core and Tor Over VPN servers make it even more difficult to trace your web traffic back to your computer. Usability Proton VPN is fairly easy to use, although its apps aren’t as streamlined as the minimalist ExpressVPN. Power users should appreciate Proton’s customizable apps with features like connection profiles to specify certain servers or protocols. Although Proton VPN is privacy-forward, it’s not all work and no play. We were impressed with Proton’s excellent streaming chops. It effortlessly unblocked many foreign Netflix libraries, including Netflix Egypt, as well as BBC iPlayer, CBC, Max, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus.We had no issues performing VPN basics with its apps across all platforms -- switching servers, changing VPN protocols and toggling on or off the kill switch. While the kill switch works on Windows, Android and MacOS, a design flaw doesn’t properly inform you that your public IP address may be exposed when switching servers on Mac, even with the kill switch enabled (an issue that plagues some other VPNs on Mac). Especially considering Proton VPN’s strong focus on privacy and transparency, we were disappointed by its unintuitive MacOS kill switch notification functionality. Nevertheless, Proton VPN is a great choice for power users, especially power users, thanks to its unique privacy features and excellent streaming service unblocking.

Why we like it Mullvad is a small but mighty VPN that holds its own against the top players in the VPN industry. We like that Mullvad requires no personal information to purchase or use, which is part of what makes it the best VPN for privacy. At signup, you’ll be assigned a randomly generated numerical code that you use to purchase the subscription and sign into the apps, eliminating the need for a username or password. Mullvad is fast, easy to use across platforms and boasts some of the industry’s best privacy features, but sometimes at the expense of certain casual use cases like streaming. If you’re a VPN user who has heightened online privacy needs and will be using your VPN predominantly to protect your privacy, Mullvad is the way to go -- especially if you’re on a budget. But if you’re more of a casual VPN user who just wants to stream content internationally from various streaming providers, then you’ll be better off with ExpressVPN, NordVPN or Surfshark.Mullvad’s prices are about as straightforward as it gets: 5 euro (about $6) per month, whether you use it for a month, six months or indefinitely. There are no discounts or recurring subscription plans available, and you only need to pay for the months that you need the VPN, which allows for maximum flexibility. That said, you can pay upfront for up to a year at any time by adding time to your account. If you purchase 12 months, it’ll cost you 60 euro (about $72), which is cheaper than the yearly rate that many other top VPNs charge. Alternatively, you can purchase a year of Mullvad from Amazon for $57 if you want to get it for even cheaper. Also featured inBest Cheap VPNs, Fastest VPNs

Mullvad speedsWe measured a 24% speed loss in our latest Mullvad speed tests. While that’s a drop from the 13% speed loss we measured last year, it still makes Mullvad one of the fastest VPNs available. And considering Mullvad’s relatively small network of 724 servers across 49 countries, the VPN’s speed performance is commendable. There are other VPNs that have thousands of servers in over 100 countries that aren’t nearly as fast as Mullvad. Mullvad’s plenty fast enough for data-heavy activities like streaming, torrenting or gaming.Privacy and transparencyPrivacy and transparency are where Mullvad really shines. Everything Mullvad does is based on the company’s uncompromising commitment to protecting user privacy, from its innovative privacy features to its anonymous sign up process, always-on kill switch and lack of recurring subscriptions.On top of getting the basics right, Mullvad offers some additional privacy features that go above and beyond what many other VPNs deliver. Mullvad was one of the first VPN providers to offer post-quantum protections, a forward-looking privacy feature that helps protect users against potential future threats from quantum computers. And unique to Mullvad is Defense Against AI-guided Traffic Analysis (DAITA), a feature that helps protect users from having their encrypted web traffic identified using artificial intelligence. The feature does this by sending dummy packets while making each data packet the same size in order to prevent adversaries from leveraging AI to identify the patterns of data packets that users send and receive through the VPN tunnel and match it to actual web traffic. Mullvad upgraded DAITA this year by more strategically injecting dummy packets to optimize for speed and privacy. And the team is currently working on an additional method of defense. Mullvad also undergoes regular external audits and its apps are open-source, meaning that its source code is publicly available online for anyone to scrutinize. Additionally, Mullvad is working on a way to make its server infrastructure fully user-auditable at any time and in real time.UsabilityMullvad’s apps deliver a consistent experience across devices and are extremely simple to use. With Mullvad, you’ll get apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS and Android TV, along with browser extensions and router support (which can help you bypass its restrictive limit of five simultaneous devices). Features are easy to access and work as expected on all platforms we tested, but it would be nice to see wider support from Mullvad for streaming devices. While most top VPNs have native apps for Apple TV and Fire TV Stick, Mullvad doesn’t yet -- although you can use Mullvad's Android .apk to run the VPN on Fire TV Stick. Mullvad’s streaming capabilities overall are hit or miss, making it a tough sell for anyone looking to do lots of streaming. We were denied access to content on Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu in our latest tests. In our spring 2025 tests, we were able to access content only on Netflix and Max. Other top VPNs typically are able to deliver access to a wide array of streaming services and on a larger selection of dedicated streaming devices. Mullvad has a 14-day money-back guarantee, so you can give it a try before fully committing to see if it’s the right VPN for you.

What is the best VPN in 2025?
The race for the best VPN title tightened after our round of August retests, leaving our top three VPNs all within half a point of one another. ExpressVPN rolled out new subscription options, but while some configurations are cheaper, most are not a better value than the previous iteration. It remains at a 9.0/10. Conversely, Surfshark has added helpful new features like FastTrack, better justifying its higher prices. We've raised its overall rating to 8.6/10. Here's a fuller breakdown of where our top picks stand.ExpressVPN is the best VPN overall thanks to its streamlined apps, fast server speeds, excellent streaming service unblocking and strong privacy. All told, ExpressVPN is an outstanding VPN for beginners and privacy experts alike. Its intuitive apps are a breeze to use, and we appreciate ExpressVPN’s forward-thinking approach to privacy. You'll even find servers across all 50 of the United States, making it a great choice for travel within the US and unblocking regional sports such as NFL games. However, ExpressVPN charges a premium for its service. For its new basic plan, which is essentially just the VPN service, you'll pay $13 per month, $75 for the first year or $98 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $99 annually).
CNETNordVPN is an exceptional VPN that’s extremely fast, great for streaming and packed with privacy features. Its connection speeds were the fastest we tested. Coupled with its extensive international server network and fantastic streaming service unblocking, Nord is one of the top VPNs for streaming. Plus, its massive global server footprint means NordVPN works well for travel. While NordVPN is initially a superb value at $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years, auto-renewal price hikes jack the cost up to an extortionate $140 annually on the one- and two-year plans. So we recommend monitoring your subscription to avoid a costly price increase. In July 2025, NordVPN released scam call protection on Android, making it an even more attractive mobile VPN.Surfshark is a great choice for folks seeking unique privacy features on a budget. It offers connection speeds and features comparable to ExpressVPN and NordVPN, but at an annual rate that's considerably cheaper at $48 for the first year or $60 total for the first two years (then $79 a year after the promotional period for both the one- and two-year plans). Surfshark gives you unlimited simultaneous connections, a benefit that most pricier competitors lack, including ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Despite its relative affordability in comparison with VPN rivals, Surfshark packs a privacy punch, offering unique features like split tunneling on MacOS and Dynamic MultiHop. Still, Surfshark doesn't quite match ExpressVPN's commitment to privacy, making it less suitable for people with critical privacy needs.Proton VPN is the most versatile VPN on the market. It's privacy-forward, with neat features such as discreet app icons on Android to disguise your VPN app as a notes, weather or calculator app. An obfuscation-focused VPN protocol focuses on masking your VPN connection as standard web traffic to slip through firewalls. But Proton VPN works equally well for casual users seeking an excellent VPN for streaming -- it even unblocks tough-to-access regional content like Netflix Egypt. At $10 per month, $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually), Proton is a great value.Mullvad VPN is the most private VPN. While you'll find the privacy basics, Mullvad goes above and beyond what most VPNs provide. Its unique privacy approach means you don't need to give the company any personal information if you don't want to -- not even an email address -- and you can even pay with cash. All of its apps are open-source, meaning anyone can inspect its source code for bugs or vulnerabilities. What's more, Mullvad's transparency extends to its pricing -- you'll pay 5 euros per month (about $6) whether you sign up for one month, one year or more with no price hikes at all. If you're seriously concerned about privacy, Mullvad is the VPN for you.Each VPN service we recommend has excellent value for a specific use case, and we point out the ideal customer for each one. The array of options available means there's a VPN service suited to your needs, whether your privacy needs are casual or critical. Also, consider jumping on one of the best VPN deals currently available, which many of our top picks are offering.

About VPNs
A virtual private network enhances your privacy by masking your public IP address, which is similar to your home address in that it provides your general geographical location. With a VPN enabled, your internet service provider or mobile carrier can't tell what apps you use or websites you visit, so you can hide your internet browsing and app activity or torrent privately. Because VPNs encrypt your web traffic by routing it through secure servers, you can make it appear as though you're connecting from a different city, state or country, which lets you unblock geographically restricted content, meaning you can access foreign Netflix libraries to watch content like K-Pop Demon Hunters, watch movies and shows like The Guest on BBC iPlayer outside of the UK and stream regional or international sports matches, like NFL or soccer games.VPNs are also nifty for travel because you can access services like email from your home country while abroad for a summer vacation without dealing with annoying CAPTCHAs. Because of their diverse applications, VPNs are excellent additions to your app arsenal. The best VPNs offer robust privacy protections without compromising on performance, notably internet speeds. At CNET, we rigorously test each VPN across all major platforms to determine the ones that provide exceptional privacy, reliability, speed, streaming service unblocking and value. We retested our top picks in August to try out new features and make sure existing ones were working as intended.VPN feature comparison: See how our top picks stack up

Factors to consider in a VPN
When shopping for a virtual private network, you'll need to figure out the best VPN for your needs and budget. Here's what to look for.Internet speed lossVPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server before communicating with apps, websites and other internet services rather than a direct connection. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less. This table shows the speeds we experienced in our testing. Your speeds will vary depending on factors like your internet service plan and connection type. The percentage of speed lost is intended as a general indicator of how much the VPN slows down your connection; lower numbers represent a faster overall connection. ProviderSpeed loss NordVPN 3%Proton VPN 16%ExpressVPN 18%Surfshark 21%Mullvad 24%
PrivacyAt a minimum, we recommend a VPN with 256-bit encryption (for OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (with WireGuard), a strict no-logging policy and DNS leak protection. Because logging is tough to verify, look for regular third-party audits. You can and should be skeptical of your VPN provider's zero-log claims. Still, VPN audits are important even if they don't provide the full privacy picture.Additionally, transparency reports offer peace of mind. We also suggest sticking with a VPN that includes a kill switch, which shuts your internet off in case your VPN unexpectedly disconnects.More privacy-concerned folks such as investigative journalists or political activists will appreciate advanced features such as obfuscation (which makes it harder for ISPs to determine that you're using a VPN), Tor over VPN (for additional encryption using the Tor network) and a double VPN (which relies on a second VPN server connection to enhance encryption). Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind.Server networkWhen considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. For instance, one virtual private network company may have twice the total number of servers as a competitor but half the different country locations, meaning you've got fewer international choices. Anything over 60 countries will work for many folks.You'll sometimes find specialty servers, such as Tor (The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers. Onion over VPN and Double VPN servers provide extra privacy by bolstering your encryption even further when compared with a standard VPN connection. On the other hand, obfuscated servers make it more difficult for apps, websites or internet service providers to determine that you're using a VPN.Device supportMost virtual private network services offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. Apple TV apps are increasingly common, with ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA, NordVPN, PrivadoVPN and IPVanish offering TVOS applications. ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton and PIA boast Linux GUI apps, making them compelling choices for Linux VPNs.Most VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Proton give you 10. Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish are unlimited. Even with a provider like Express, Proton or Nord, you can still install a VPN on as many devices as you wish, but you'll be able to have only a handful of active sessions at once. You can also install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage, although this will typically void the warranty on the router.VPN device compatibility Wondering which VPN services work on which devices?

*Smart television sets running Google TV/Android TV or Fire TV can download VPN apps directly, while LG's webOS, Samsung's Tizen OS and Roku TVs require a router VPN.**For Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Vivaldi.Streaming capabilitiesVPNs can be great for privacy. They're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. A VPN lets you stream services like Peacock (for NFL games), Max or Hulu from your home country while traveling abroad. Conversely, VPNs also unlock access to foreign libraries on platforms like Netflix (to watch Wednesday), Disney Plus (for Marvel's latest shows) and Amazon Prime Video (currently featuring Reacher). You may even be able to save money by using a VPN for streaming. For more info, check out the best VPNs for Amazon Prime Video and the best VPNs for streaming.CostWith most VPNs, you can buy virtual private network service on a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year plan. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a data breach or stop allowing access to foreign Netflix libraries over a year, at which point you’ll probably want to switch servicesMake a budget, then find a VPN provider that fits the bill while being mindful of price hikes. Notably, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription, like avoiding raised renewal rates by taking advantage of seasonal discounts like Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. If you're on a budget, you may want to consider one of the best cheap VPNs, like Surfshark, PIA or Mullvad.

VPN speed test data
Although VPN speeds aren't the only important criteria, you'll need a virtual private network provider with fast speeds. If all servers severely hinder your internet speeds, then streaming, browsing the web or hopping on Zoom calls may be be frustrating. Here's how VPN provider speeds stacked up.
How we test VPNs
Our hands-on testing and review process is designed to cut through the hype and determine the best VPNs of the bunch. When we look at each VPN service, we're not just examining them for their technical weaknesses, but we're also scrutinizing their individual performance strengths in various areas, like privacy, streaming or value for the money. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN across over 20 factors, and we continually improve our methodology as we learn more. Our rigorous testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests across multiple worldwide servers to determine accurate internet speed loss averages.We test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries, as well as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks. By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting or sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and its ownership in a notoriously murky market.The VPNs on this list earn our recommendation for more than just boosting their digital privacy strengths -- they enable easy streaming to overcome geo-blocked media, have torrenting-friendly servers and are fast enough to support gaming globally. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the uses we recommend it for most. Because we strive to keep on top of a fast-changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we learn more and retest.

How to choose the right VPN for you
Picking the best VPN requires knowing two basic things to start with: What you want to use it for, and what you're willing to pay. The range of VPN offerings is vast, but those two things will help you find a VPN that has the right blend of speed, security and cost.Below, you'll find specific FAQ sections on picking a VPN based on the most common needs: gaming, streaming media, working from home and privacy-critical professions. In general, you'll want a VPN that provides sufficient encryption, doesn't log your activity, offers essential security features like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, has server locations where you need them and can give you fast connection speeds. Our top five VPNs have all these features, although connection speeds will vary based on your internet provider and the server you connect to.For a deeper dive, check our detailed walk-through of how we evaluate and review VPNs. If you're looking for some quick pointers, here are universally applicable advice guides for beginners:VPN Red Flags to Watch Out ForHow to Identify a Good VPN

Other VPNs we've testedNot every VPN can be a favorite. These are the ones we reviewed, but they're not full-throated recommendations for one reason or another, including limited features and concerns over adequately hiding your identity, ultimately falling short to other picks we selected as the best VPNs. In addition to the more recently tested VPNs below, we also looked at Hotspot Shield and TunnelBear a few years ago and were left disappointed at the time.PIA Private Internet Access is a budget-friendly VPN that undercuts most of the competition at $12 per month, $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 total for three years. It’s privacy-forward with open-source apps, meaning anyone can inspect the source code for vulnerabilities or bugs, and one of the most reader-friendly privacy policies we’ve encountered. PIA was largely good for streaming service unblocking, letting us watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer, Max and a slew of other sites. It’s suitable for international and US domestic travel -- you’ll get 35,000 servers in 91 countries, including servers in all 50 of the United States. PIA is a compelling choice if you want to stream regional US sports, like NFL games. While PIA largely sticks to the privacy basics, its highly customizable VPN apps should satisfy power users who want lots of control over VPN connections. Apple users will appreciate split tunneling on MacOS -- a rarity among VPN providers that few providers besides PIA and Surfshark include. However, PIA’s sluggish server speeds make it unsuitable for folks with slower or more unreliable internet connections. We clocked an underwhelming 49% average internet speed loss in our 2025 speed testing. That might be fine if you’re using Google Fiber or cable, like Spectrum, but satellite internet users should opt for a faster VPN. Moreover, we encountered a lot of CAPTCHAs using PIA, even when trying to perform a basic Google search. For a little more money, you can get a lot more value with faster speeds and more advanced privacy features by opting for a VPN like Surfshark or Proton.  Show more See all PIA plans Quick Take Servers: 35,000-plusNumber of countries: 91Country/jurisdiction: USPlatforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (GUI), Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, browsers, routersPrice: $12 per month, $40 for the first year (then $50 annually) or $79 total for three yearsIPVanish IPVanish is a decent beginner-friendly VPN for folks seeking basic privacy. It does a good job of unblocking geographically protected streaming content on multiple services, such as providing access to foreign Netflix libraries (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). We liked its intuitive VPN apps which, while easy to use even for novices, weren't quite as streamlined as apps from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While you get privacy fundamentals from IPVanish, its US jurisdiction makes it unsuitable for people with critical privacy needs, like political activists, investigative journalists or asylum-seekers.Its comparatively slow speeds -- we measured a 44% average internet speed loss -- severely lagged behind NordVPN (11%), Surfshark (17%), Proton VPN (21%) and ExpressVPN (25%). But its servers peppering 108 countries mean you get an international reach close to NordVPN (126 countries), ExpressVPN (105) countries, Surfshark (100 countries), Proton (122 countries) and PIA (91 countries). IPVanish sets you back $13 per month, $40 for your first year or $53 for two years combined -- but the one- and two-year plans jump to $156 annually (the two-year tier renews at $312 total for two years of service, which breaks down to $156 a year paid upfront) after your introductory pricing period. For the price, you can get a VPN with faster internet speed maintenance.Read our IPVanish review.

If you’re a journalist, activist, dissident, physician, attorney or anyone else with critical privacy needs looking for a solid privacy-focused VPN, you won’t find it in CyberGhost.We like that CyberGhost publishes extremely detailed quarterly transparency reports (far outdoing all other VPNs in terms of detail and frequency) and operates a RAM-only server infrastructure, but the company’s overall approach to user privacy needs some major attention. CyberGhost’s privacy policy outlines some questionable data-sharing practices, and we were perplexed by how the VPN’s website and onboarding process reinforces the dangerous falsehood that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online. We were also disappointed to see how CyberGhost attempts to trick users into agreeing to share additional data with the company through its apps.Besides CyberGhost’s dubious approach to user privacy, the VPN’s apps are a mess. Throughout our testing process, we ran into numerous bugs and choppy performance on nearly all of CyberGhost’s apps across the platforms we tested. In our testing, all of CyberGhost’s apps consistently took an abnormally long time to connect to a server. At times, the apps would become entirely unresponsive, requiring an app restart and sometimes even a full system restart. CyberGhost’s apps also don’t offer much in the way of helpful bonus features like many others, including Surfshark and NordVPN, do. If you need a fast VPN, you’ll probably be disappointed by CyberGhost’s mediocre speed performance (30% speed lost in CNET’s testing).Overall, CyberGhost is a sub-par VPN provider with buggy apps, middling speed performance and questionable privacy practices. It costs $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 for the first 24 months (then $57 annually). For a similar price or even cheaper, you can choose several VPNs that are far superior to CyberGhost.Read our CyberGhost VPN review.

Norton Secure VPN does not support P2P or BitTorrent, Linux, routers or set-top boxes. It's Netflix and streaming compatibility is somewhat limited. Even worse, during testing, we experienced privacy-compromising data leaks.During CNET's testing, Norton Secure VPN speeds were comparable to other midtier VPNs but not particularly competitive. Although its VPN is only available on four platforms -- Mac, iOS, Windows and Android -- Norton gets points for its 24/7 live customer service phone support and 60-day money-back guarantee.Norton Secure VPN costs $40 for the first year, rising to $80 upon renewal. For that price, you get protection for five devices, which is well below ExpressVPN's eight simultaneous devices, Nord and Proton's 10 or Surshark and PIA's unlimited. Most VPN providers let you install a VPN on as many devices as you like but limit your simultaneous usage, Norton restricts how many total devices you can download a VPN on. This stingy device allowance is well under the competition. If you need more, you can always upgrade to Norton's Ultra VPN Plus with its 10-device policy. Norton Secure VPN Plus and Ultra VPN Plus bundle antivirus software, so if you need a VPN with antivirus, it's a consideration.Read our Norton Secure VPN review.

Its free plan limits your monthly usage to 10GB, but you can pick from servers in 13 cities. By contrast, Proton VPN doesn't limit your data consumption, but you can't choose a server manually. You won't get the fastest internet download and upload speeds or the largest server network with its paid tiers, but Privado is a solid VPN for streaming. Privado has privacy-friendly Swiss jurisdiction, but it hasn't been audited. All of its privacy features work, including split tunneling, DNS leak protection and a kill switch, although its kill switch was almost too aggressive, keeping your internet cut off even after manually disconnecting from a server or closing the PrivadoVPN app. Because of its lack of audits, it's hard to recommend Privado for privacy-conscious users, like investigative journalists, political activists, asylum-seekers or even worried torrenters. Privado is one of the best VPNs for casual users, with a premium plan available as a convenient upgrade path.Read our PrivadoVPN review.

In today's hyperconnected world, online privacy and security are increasingly critical. From online banking to communicating remotely with colleagues, we're transferring more data on our computers and smartphones than ever before. Much of that data is confidential information that we need to keep safe from hackers and snoops, so VPN use is on the rise as people take steps to secure their digital lives.
Do I need a VPN?
Anyone who accesses the internet from a computer, tablet or smartphone can benefit from using a VPN. You don't have to be an activist, government dissident or journalist to need a VPN; the rise of third-party data brokers, cross-site advertising trackers, IP address collection and mobile geo-targeting have all combined to create an online browsing environment that poses significant threats to everyday people's basic privacy. Because a VPN encrypts your connection, your browsing data is protected from your internet service provider (and any government entities that request your ISP data), and your network administrator in most cases. A VPN can also shield your private information — like passwords, usernames and bank or shopping details — from anyone snooping on your network.

What is the best free VPN?
Proton VPN's free tier is the only free VPN we've come across so far that's worth using. It costs a lot of money to operate a VPN, and free VPN services usually make up for the lack of subscription revenue by selling user data. In addition to being limited in usability and light on security, many free VPNs are fronts for malware distribution, which is why it's generally best to avoid them. Proton VPN's unlimited free tier is fast and secure and can be used for most online activities, including streaming Netflix. PrivadoVPN also offers a free plan that's great for casual customers. But its uneven internet speeds, modest server network and lack of third-party audits hold back a recommendation as one of the best VPNs. If you're on a budget and want access to a premium VPN solution, you can also take a look at our picks for the best cheap VPNs.

What is a mobile VPN?
A mobile VPN is simply a VPN you can use on your mobile device like your iPhone or Android phone. All of the providers we recommend have mobile versions of their desktop clients. You can use a mobile-focused VPN app to ensure greater data privacy, designed for your whole device. Mobile VPNs also generally have a smaller memory footprint and require less processing power than desktop VPNs, so they tend to yield faster connection speeds and don't eat up your battery as quickly. Keep in mind that most mobile VPN clients will use a lighter form of encryption than a desktop client to achieve those smartphone speeds. Be sure to check your VPN apps' settings to ensure you're using the apps' strongest encryption if your privacy needs are heightened. Our top three VPN picks all have excellent, easy-to-use mobile VPN app options for their services. Some VPNs will only work with one type of mobile platform — like iOS or Android — and some are universally compatible. To find the right mobile VPN for you, check out our mobile-specific VPN guides below. We routinely update them with our retesting information, so check back often.How to Set Up a VPN on Your SmartphoneBest Android VPNs for 2024Best iPhone VPNs of 2024

Are VPNs legal?
VPNs are perfectly legal to use in most countries. There's nothing wrong with taking steps to protect your privacy online, and you shouldn't have to worry that using a VPN as part of that process will get you in any kind of legal trouble. There are countries where VPNs are either banned or outright illegal. If you're using a VPN in a country like China, Iran, Oman, Russia, Turkmenistan, UAE or Belarus, you may find yourself in legal trouble. The irony here is that these are the countries where internet censorship and surveillance are most common. In those countries, you'll need to make sure you use a VPN that provides strong obfuscation so your VPN traffic is disguised as ordinary HTTPS traffic, meaning government entities won't even know you're using a VPN in the first place. You won't run into any trouble with the law for using a VPN across most of the world. One important reminder: VPNs are legal in most places, but engaging in illegal activity online is still illegal regardless of whether you're using a VPN.

How do I use a VPN for Netflix?
If you live in a country that censors its media or are traveling to one, geo-restricted content is a pain. You can use a VPN to circumvent censorship or access your home country's normal media content for an online streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video or Disney Plus. Pick a VPN that lets you manually select which country you want to connect through and has something called obfuscation. (Our top three picks offer this.) You don't always need to use the obfuscation feature to unblock Netflix, but since streaming services actively try to block VPN connections, obfuscation can help because it disguises your VPN traffic as regular internet traffic.If you're looking to try out other VPNs, choose one with a large number of IP addresses, preferably 10,000 or more. This is because one of the ways Netflix and others block VPNs is by blacklisting known VPN IPs, and if your VPN has tens of thousands of IPs, there's a better chance that you'll be able to connect to an IP address that Netflix hasn't flagged.Once your VPN is installed, connect to the country whose content you wish to view, restart your browser and go to the streaming site. If your VPN is working, the site should treat you as a resident of your selected country and serve you content assigned to that audience. If you're still having trouble, you can try using incognito mode on your browser or try clearing your cookies and cache. The best VPNs for Netflix — and streaming in general — all let you access geo-restricted content buffer-free.

How do I know if my VPN is working?
Your first and most apparent indication that your VPN is working is that your IP address will change and your location will be registered as that of the VPN server you're connecting through. You can check this on a site like whatismyipaddress.com.You'll also want to make sure your VPN is protecting your privacy and not leaking any of your data outside of the VPN tunnel, thus exposing it to your ISP and other entities that may be monitoring your online activity. You can check for leaks by going to a site like dnsleaktest.com or ipleak.net. If your location is registered as the VPN server location and your leak tests turn up negative, then you know your VPN is working to protect your privacy.

What is a remote-access VPN?
A remote-access VPN uses public infrastructure like the internet to provide remote users secure access to their network. This is particularly important for organizations and their corporate networks. It's crucial when employees connect to a public hotspot and use the internet for sending work-related emails. A VPN client on the user's computer or mobile device connects to a VPN gateway on the company's network. This gateway will typically require the device to authenticate its identity. It will then create a network link back to the device that allows it to reach internal network resources such as file servers, printers and intranets as if it were on the same local network.

What is a site-to-site VPN?
This is when the VPN technology uses a gateway device to connect the entire network in one location to a network in another location. The majority of site-to-site VPNs that connect over the internet use IPsec. IPsec-based encryption protocols are often considered by VPN specialists to be less secure against modern surveillance. Rather than using the public internet, it is also normal to use multiprotocol label-switching clouds as the main transport for site-to-site VPNs.VPNs are often defined between specific computers, and in most cases, they are servers in separate data centers. New hybrid-access situations have now transformed the VPN gateway in the cloud, typically with a secure link from the cloud service provider into the internal network.
