Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN
Unbeaten Chelsea contests its fourth London derby in as many games on Saturday as it takes on a Brentford team still looking to settle after a difficult summer.Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching English Premier League games as they happen, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if it's not available where you are.Chelsea's capital clashes have so far yielded two wins and a draw for Enzo Maresca's men, and a win here could see them move to the top of the EPL. Having missed his side's wins over West Ham and Fulham, star man Cole Palmer has been back in training this week, and is in contention for a return to action for the Blues today. While the away team is shaping up to be a genuine title contender this term, most Brentford fans will likely settle for a season that sees them avoid relegation. Over the summer, the Bees lost key players Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Nørgaard and Yoane Wissa, as well as manager Thomas Frank.Last month's battling 1-0 win over Aston Villa may have raised expectations above that low bar, but the hugely disappointing 2-1 collapse at Sunderland that followed has Bees fans once again fearing that a season of struggle may be in store for Keith Andrews' team. Brentford takes on Chelsea on Saturday, Sept. 13, at the Gtech Community Stadium, with kickoff set for 8 p.m. BST. That makes it a 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 5 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Sunday morning.
João Pedro has started life as a Chelsea player brightly, registering two goals and two assists in his first three Premier League games since joining the Blues in the summer from Brighton.  Mike Hewitt/Getty Images How to watch Brentford vs. Chelsea in the US without cableThis London derby clash will be broadcast on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login. It can also be streamed via Sling TV and other, more expensive streaming TV services.

How to watch the English Premier League 2025-26 season from anywhere with a VPNIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the EPL action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming.  It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security.  However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance.  If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial.

Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming EPL matches may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the "search for city or country" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log in to your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.
