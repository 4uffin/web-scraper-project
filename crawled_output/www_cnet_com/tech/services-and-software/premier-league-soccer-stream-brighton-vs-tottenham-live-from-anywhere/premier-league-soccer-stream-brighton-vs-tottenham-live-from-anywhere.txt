Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN
Thomas Frank has made a superb start to life as Tottenham manager and the Lilywhites will look to claim another win in the English Premier League on Saturday as they travel to the Amex Stadium to face a stuttering Brighton. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching EPL games as they happen, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if it's not available where you are.Tottenham comes into this clash after an encouraging week. Spurs thrashed local rival West Ham at the London Stadium before getting their Champions League campaign off to a winning start with a narrow 1-0 victory at home against Villarreal. Fabian Hürzeler, meanwhile, marked his 50th game in charge of Brighton last weekend in disappointing style with the Seagulls crashing to a 2-1 defeat away at south coast rivals Bournemouth. Brighton & Hove Albion takes on Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, Sept. 20, at the Amex Stadium, with kickoff set for 3 p.m. BST. That makes it a 10 a.m. ET or 7 a.m. PT start in the US and Canada, and a 12 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia.
Brighton boss Fabian Hürzeler has seen his side claim just one victory in their opening four matches so far this season.  Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images How to watch Brighton vs. Tottenham in the US without cableThis match at the Amex Stadium will be broadcast on streaming service Peacock. To catch the game live, you'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus subscription.

How to watch the Premier League 2025-26 from anywhere with a VPNIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the EPL action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming.  It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security.  However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance.  If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

Can I livestream Brighton vs. Spurs in the UK?No broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK because of the traditional Saturday 3 p.m. kickoff blackout. This prohibits matches from being shown in the region at that time to protect attendances throughout the English football pyramid. That also means that if you're traveling in the UK, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game as you normally would at home, because of geoblocking.There's one option to get around this. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast, and go from there. Livestream Brighton vs. Tottenham in Canada If you want to livestream EPL games in Canada this season, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights to the Premier League once again and will be broadcasting all 380 matches live.

Quick tips for streaming the Premier League using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming EPL matches may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the "search for city or country" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log in to your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, because both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.
