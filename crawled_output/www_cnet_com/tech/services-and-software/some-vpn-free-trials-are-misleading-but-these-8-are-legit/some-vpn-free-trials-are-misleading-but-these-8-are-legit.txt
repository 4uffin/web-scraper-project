Some VPN Free Trials Are Misleading, but These 8 Are Legit
You don't have to pay upfront to take a spin with a VPN.
Alex Valdes
Alex Valdes from Bellevue, Washington has been pumping content into the Internet river for quite a while, including stints at MSNBC.com, MSN, Bing, MoneyTalksNews, Tipico and more. He admits to being somewhat fascinated by the Cambridge coffee webcam back in the Roaring '90s.

Surfshark is one of several VPNs that offer truly free trials. James Martin/CNET
Repeat after me: Activate, then cancel. Activate, then cancel. You'll sleep better at night and your wallet won't take a hit.That's one piece of advice from SafePaper, accompanied by its 2025 VPN free trial guide. The cybersecurity and online privacy website tested more than 30 VPN services to determine which offer true-blue free trials and "not just 'risk-free' money-back guarantees."When shopping for VPNs, you'll find many that offer "free trials," but not all free trials are made the same. There are those where you have to pay up front, and then only get your money back if you don't violate the refund clause. SafePaper has identified the VPNs that offer genuine free trials, where you get to use the service for free (usually 1 to 7 days) before your payment method kicks in -- unless you cancel first, of course.Read more from CNET: The Best Free VPNs | The Best Cheap VPNs | Save on Your Subscription"True free trials are surprisingly rare in the VPN industry," said Paige West, editor at SafePaper, said in a statement. "We wanted to cut through the marketing language and identify services that offer real no-commitment access, especially for users who value transparency and cost control."It's not that VPNs with genuine free trials are better than those that offer refunds after the trial is over. "It's a matter of preference" as to which free trial VPN you want to try out, said CNET VPN expert Attila Tomaschek."A VPN free trial typically only lasts a few days, giving users limited time to thoroughly test the service," Tomaschek said. "A money-back guarantee, while requiring upfront payment, usually lasts about 30 days, which can help users get a much more comprehensive look at the service over a longer period of time."See also: NordVPN vs. Surfshark: See How These Sister Services Stack UpBut buyer beware, adds Tomaschek: "While getting your money back from a reputable VPN provider is usually unconditional and pretty straightforward, it's important for users to read the fine print ahead of making a purchase to ensure the VPN company doesn't impose any hidden caveats like usage limits that may void its money-back guarantee."Free trials, no payment requiredIn its report, SafePaper identified eight VPN providers with free trials that did not require payment to use the trial. They're listed below, with info about how long the trials last, which operating systems they work with and whether payment info is required:Surfshark (see CNET review): 7 days; payment info required; all major operating systemsCyberGhost (see CNET review): 1-7 days (varies by device); partial payment info; Windows, MacOS, Android, iOSKaspersky: 7 days (non-US); payment info required; all major operating systemsX-VPN: 7 days; payment info required; all major operating systemsNordVPN (see CNET review): 3 days; payment info required; Android onlyHideIPVPN: 3 days; no payment info required; all major operating systemsHidemy.name: 1 day; no payment info required; all major operating systemsWordVPN: 1 day; no payment info required; all major operating systemsLook before you leapSafePaper added a few pro tips to consider when going with a free VPN trial: Cancel immediately after you activate the trial. That way, you won't get charged if you miss the deadline to cancel the subscription. And haven't most of us made that mistake before?You should try two to three different VPN services before making your final decision. Compare speed, support and stability.Use alternate email addresses to safeguard the privacy of your primary email account.
