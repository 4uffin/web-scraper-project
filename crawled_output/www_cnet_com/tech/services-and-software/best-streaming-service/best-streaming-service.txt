What to consider
Content
Originals, kids titles and back catalogs all make a difference when deciding which streaming service is worth your money, along with the availability of new releases and blockbuster movies. Examine the library offerings of each streamer to determine whether they carry all episodes of shows you enjoy, movies, older titles or a selection of foreign content.
Price
Now that most streaming platforms offer ad-based options, you can choose whether you want to pay to watch without commercials, or if tolerating ads is better for your budget. Monthly prices start around $6-$7 and go up to $23, but you can also consider rotating your services to pay less overall for streaming TV in a year.
Simultaneous streams
With any streaming service, you'll want to know how many screens you can watch at a time. For example, Netflix's ad-based plan allows two simultaneous streams, but you have to upgrade to the premium version if your family needs four screens. Look for platform offerings that let your household stream on multiple devices at once if that's what you need.

Best for originals
Netflix
Pros
Simple interface that's easy to navigate
Solid recommendation system
Abundant catalog of licensed movies, shows and originals including Bridgerton, Wednesday
Cons
Expensive subscription plans
Fee for extra members
There's a reason why Netflix has become shorthand for streaming in general. The service has evolved into a must-have streaming app, even if you choose to pay extra to share your password. With big originals like Squid Game, Wednesday and Stranger Things dropping new seasons in 2025, and award-winning titles, it's giving us the closest thing we have to watercooler conversations these days. Netflix has a dependable and user-friendly interface while offering a vast range of features and a constantly evolving catalog with diverse content -- there's something for everyone. New on-demand shows and movies arrive each week, making running out of stuff to watch hard. You also get mobile games, live events like WWE Raw, kids' content, and anime and foreign-language programming, plus you can discover titles by using secret codes. Its ad-based tier makes it more affordable than rivals such as Disney Plus and Max, but we admit the recent price hike makes its ad-free plans pricier than others. Who it's perfect for: Habitual binge-watchers who prefer to watch TV shows as a full run. If you like a constant flow of newly arrived content -- whether it's a Netflix original or licensed titles like Interview with the Vampire or Young Sheldon -- the streamer carries movies and series for viewers of all ages. Great if you like to stream on your phone to watch new drops on demand or downloaded favorites on the go. Consider alternatives if: If you're a fan of network and cable TV shows currently airing new seasons, Netflix's catalog may be hit or miss for you. Hulu, Peacock and Paramount Plus are better suited for on-air shows because new episodes drop the next day on those platforms. Though on par with the competition, the cost of Netflix's ad-free plans may be a deterrent, and the service is only available in one bundle exclusive to Xfinity customers.Popular titles: Squid Game, Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters, Wednesday  ...

Best for families, Marvel, Star Wars
Disney Plus
Pros
Huge library that includes Agatha All Along, Daredevil, Moana
Reasonably priced bundles
Adjustable content rating system
Can watch Hulu, ESPN within app
Cons
Extended waits for new or original releases
Charges extra member fee
Disney Plus is one of Netflix's closest competitors for good reason. It's the only place where you can stream the vast majority of the Disney and Pixar libraries, along with every Star Wars movie, Marvel films, original TV shows, NatGeo content and The Simpsons. Shows like Bluey, Andor and Daredevil: Born Again attract millions of fans, and its catalog of films include brand hits such as Moana, Mufasa: The Lion King and Deadpool & Wolverine. At the current price of $10 per month for the ad-based plan, Disney Plus is a family-friendly streaming TV choice that offers value. Hub tiles make it easy to navigate its organized library, and if you're also subscribed to Hulu or ESPN, you can watch content for both within the app. Like Netflix, however, it now charges an optional extra user fee if you want to share your account.Who it's perfect for: With access to the Disney vault, Marvel, we consider it a must-have if you have kids or are a fan of any of its other titles (and who isn't a fan of Baby Yoda?). If you are a bundle lover, you should get one of Disney's money-saving packages. Ad-free Disney Plus is $16 monthly, there are four bundles that range from $11 to $27 per month. $11 Duo Basic combines Disney Plus and Hulu with ads, ad-free Duo Premium is $20. For $17 monthly, Trio Basic comes with Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus, all with ads. The $27-per-month Trio Premium bundle nets you all three streaming platforms, and only ESPN Plus has ads. Though it's not an official "Disney Bundle," there's an alternate package that combines Max, Hulu and Disney Plus for either $17 or $30 a month, depending on whether you want to go with ads or ad-free.Consider alternatives if: Disney Plus does not release new titles every week or month, which limits its slate and reasons to keep this service consistently throughout the year. Live programming consists of ABC News and occasional special events. And if you don't have kids or aren't a Marvel or Star Wars fan, its library and price may not be worth it for you.Popular titles: Agatha All Along, Bluey, The Mandalorian, Andor  ... Show more

Max/Warner Bros. Discovery/James Martin
Best streaming service for premium content
HBO Max
Pros
Slick interface
Loads of top-grade content for all audiences
Titles include The Last of Us, The White Lotus and House of the Dragon
Reliable, customizable parental controls
HBO titles stream at the same time as cable network
Cons
Pricier subscriptions, even with ads
Constant removal of beloved content like Looney Tunes
HBO Max has HBO's entire library, DC Universe titles and almost every Studio Ghibli film, along with favorites such as Friends, the Lord of the Rings movies and movies like Sinners and Mickey 17. It's the primary destination for new Warner Bros.-owned feature films, folds in unscripted series from Discovery brands like HGTV and TLC and is home to HBO Max originals such as Hacks and The Pitt. It's not Disney Plus, but HBO Max has a decent streaming collection for kids, too, with the ability to control ratings on kids' profiles.Although its 8.0 rating is neck-and-neck with Prime Video's, HBO Max consistently drops new releases, possesses a large back catalog, and offers user-friendly features. New episodes are surfaced at the top of the home page, and search functionality and brand hubs help make navigation a snap. The B/R sports tier, which streams live sports events for MLB, NHL, NBA, and more, is included on its ad-free premium plans. Who it's perfect for: Fans of Warner Bros., HBO, Cartoon Network and DC have lots to binge, there's a reliable rotation of high-quality new shows and movies each month. Consider alternatives if: HBO Max is pricey. At $10 per month for its ad plan, it's at the higher end of the streaming spectrum, and if you prefer the ad-free experience, the cost jumps up to $17 or $21 per month.

James Martin/CNET
Best for network TV shows from ABC, FX
Hulu
Pros
Low monthly price
Access to network shows and originals including Abbott Elementary, The Handmaid's Tale, Love Island
New episodes are available almost immediately
Option to get the Disney Bundle
Cons
Smaller catalog of originals than its rivals
Can't access outside the US Menus are sometimes hard to navigate
Glitches on occasion
For $10 per month (with ads), Hulu offers a counterpoint to Netflix. Its channel lineup has a huge variety of familiar shows from networks like ABC, Fox and FX that you can watch soon after they air (unlike on Netflix), as well as a growing catalog of its own critically acclaimed original series like The Handmaid's Tale, How to Die Alone and Only Murders in the Building. Hulu has new and old movies from Searchlight, 20th Century Studios and its own production team (have you seen Prey?), while kids can stream picks from Disney brands. There's also a live news feed from ABC that's included. If you have $10 a month to spare and don't mind trading a few ads for a wealth of TV options, Hulu is a no-brainer. You also have the option to upgrade to a no-ads plan for $19 a month or get a Disney bundle to save money on the service. Separately, you can get Hulu's live TV streaming for $83 a month for a full cable replacement.Who it's perfect for: Cord-cutters who want to watch network TV series from ABC, FX, Fox or A&E can stream new episodes the day after they air for shows like American Idol, Grey's Anatomy and The Cleaning Lady. FX hits like Shogun, new anime releases and original films and shows beef up its catalog, and we like that you can stream some titles on the Disney Plus app if you have both services. Consider alternatives if: Ad-based Hulu is not the best experience, as commercial breaks are lengthy and repetitive. Ad-free Hulu is expensive on its own at $19 a month, so you may find it's not worth it without signing up for a bundle. Though it's a diverse lineup, Hulu's smaller library of originals may not feel as exciting as Netflix for new arrivals. Popular titles: Abbott Elementary, Shogun, The Handmaid's Tale  ... Show more

Best for Amazon Prime members
Prime Video
Pros
Included with Prime membership
Large selection of movies and TV shows including The Boys, The Rings of Power and Swarm
Offline downloads
Cons
Confusing search process and menus
Free and paid content stacked together
Defaults to ad-based version
Prime Video now has ads in its default version of the streaming app, but you can pay a $3 fee to stream without them. The commercial breaks are relatively short compared with other streamers. The platform offers quality original shows and movies like The Boys and Invincible, an impressive back catalog of older favorites (and B-movies you haven't heard of) and live NFL games on Thursday nights. It lacks the catalogs of Netflix and Hulu and the star power of Disney's streaming platform, but it's where you can subscribe to other services such as HBO Max, Paramount Plus or Apple TV Plus as add-ons to make it convenient to stream in one place. The streamer also offers a suite of live channels that include local news feeds, PBS Kids and more. Prime Video's recent redesign aims to cut through navigation confusion with clearer labeling and menu updates, so you can distinguish among included Prime Video content, what requires a paid subscription or what's available to rent. Who it's perfect for: A Prime Video subscription is already included for millions of Amazon Prime members at no extra cost. If you're interested in checking out any of its originals like Fallout, Nascar, Thursday Night Football or Prime Video's large movie selection, it may even be worth paying the standalone $9-per-month TV fee (if you don't have Amazon Prime).Consider alternatives if: Non-Prime members may not find Prime Video's library enticing enough to pay for a monthly standalone subscription. While there are quality shows and movies on the platform that you can either binge or watch weekly, its slate of new releases isn't as robust as other services.Popular titles: The Boys, Good Omens, Cross, Fallout  ...

Best streamer for hockey, UFC
ESPN Plus
Pros
ESPN originals
Plenty to watch for NHL, UFC fans
Cons
Missing live broadcasts for NFL and NBA
ESPN Plus is a great streaming service for sports fans who follow the NHL, NWSL and UFC. This is because ESPN Plus is the new home of all out-of-market National Hockey League games along with those from soccer leagues around the world. It hosts exclusive UFC matches and pay-per-view events, such as UFC Fight Night and championship bouts (for additional fees).Hockey fans who root for teams that aren't based where they live need ESPN's streaming service to watch their team's action. The service won't be of much use to fans of the home teams. Local games are blacked out on ESPN Plus, so you'll need access to your regional sports network through cable or a live TV streaming service to watch them. Golf fans can stream the PGA Tour live on the platform.Who it's perfect for: NHL and UFC fans, and those who love international soccer leagues or the National Women's Soccer League can find what they want, and there's a solid selection of original content. If you already have a Disney bundle, which includes Hulu and Disney Plus starting at $15 a month, it's an added perk. A standalone subscription for ESPN Plus costs $12, but some viewers may find it more cost-effective to pay for one of the Disney Bundles, which range from $17 to $27 monthly with ESPN Plus included.Consider alternatives if: You want more sports. ESPN Plus doesn't show live NFL or NBA games, and while its vast library of original programming is impressive, it's difficult to navigate. The service is best suited for die-hard fans of the sports it covers well, but more casual fans might find themselves with an ESPN Plus subscription anyway through the Disney Bundle.If you're looking to watch an abundance of sports content, check out our picks for the best sports streaming services.Popular titles: The Pat McAfee Show  ...

Best budget service for network TV, Universal movies, live sports
Peacock
Pros
Stream Yellowstone, Real Housewives, Chicago Fire, live sports, Bel-Air
Live broadcasts of NFL's Sunday Night Football and other sports
Decent selection of new and older movies like Wicked
Cons
No offline downloads for mobile unless you upgrade
NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock offers a premium ad-supported option for $11 a month, granting you access to more than 80,000 hours worth of content from NBC, Bravo, SyFy, Universal Pictures and USA Network. Upgrade to Premium Plus for $17 a month to watch without commercials. Fan favorites on the platform include Law & Order and The Office, and viewers can also watch live NFL Sunday Night Football, Premier League soccer matches, WWE events and originals like Bel-Air, Traitors and Poker Face.New episodes of NBC TV series reside on Peacock and are streamable the next day, and Premium Plus members can watch live local NBC channels in real time. Universal films hit the platform after their theatrical run, so you can enjoy new movies like Wicked, Nosferatu and The Wild Robot with your subscription. The streamer also includes a line of live channels across genres like Unsolved Mysteries, NBC News Now and Game Show Central.Peacock drops in the rankings due to its lack of mobile downloads for its non-premium plus tiers and limited 4K HDR streaming, which most of its competitors offer. That said, it's budget-friendly and you can get the service as part of a bundle with Netflix and Apple TV Plus if you have Xfinity, and there are ways to get Peacock for free.Who it's perfect for: Fans of NBC, Universal films, live sports and reality shows will enjoy Peacock's library with a wallet-friendly price. It's filled with binge-worthy shows like The Real Housewives, Yellowstone, Modern Family, Days of Our Lives and Columbo, and NBC series can be streamed the day after their linear broadcasts.Consider alternatives if: You want downloads for on-the-go streaming? Look elsewhere unless you want to pay more. Peacock has great originals, but if you're not heavily into NBC series, sports or reality shows, then you should subscribe only when there's something you want to watch.Popular titles: Yellowstone, Love Island USA, Traitors, Poker Face, Bel-Air  ...

Large selection of reality shows, kids' titles from Nickelodeon, and access to CBS hits
Streams major movies such as Gladiator II and Top Gun: Maverick soon after release
Live NFL games
Inexpensive monthly price
Ability to watch Showtime titles
Cons
Few originals outside of Evil, Yellowstone: 1883 and Star Trek
Not much 4K HDR content
Paramount Plus brings together live news and sports with on-demand shows and movies, including originals, leaning on parent company Paramount's brands like CBS, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and Paramount Network, plus its Paramount Pictures movie studio. Now that Showtime series and movies have merged into the Paramount Plus app, you can upgrade to a premium subscription to watch content from both services in one place.The service has a ton of content: 40,000 episodes of TV and 2,500 movies, plus dozens of original series, for either $8 a month (with ads) or $13 a month (ad-free with Showtime), which . Two of its biggest draws include South Park and Taylor Sheridan series Landman, 1923, 1883 and Tulsa King. Buzz-worthy Paramount feature films like Gladiator II, Top Gun: Maverick and Sonic 3 also land here first after they hit theaters.Much of Paramount's value lies in nostalgia: You can watch almost every old Nickelodeon show, Comedy Central stand-up specials and popular series ranging from Frasier and Cheers to SpongeBob SquarePants and Young & the Restless. Additionally, Paramount Plus has a Live Channels feature that enables subscribers to watch curated content in special categories. You can check out live content for Star Trek, CBS Sports HQ, Paw Patrol and more with either subscription plan. Who it's perfect for: There's enough Taylor Sheridan, CBS (including live sports) and Nickelodeon to satisfy everyone in your household, and the platform is just $8 a month if you don't mind a few ads. With Paramount Pictures' new movies and reality content from VH1 and BET, the service offers value. Consider alternatives if: Constant streams of new film releases are not Paramount Plus' strength, so if that's a must, then you would be better off with Netflix or HBO Max. Popular titles: Yellowjackets, Evil, Landman, Tulsa King, Lioness, The Equalizer, Ghosts  ... Show more

Best service for ad-free premium content
Apple TV Plus
Pros
Ted Lasso, and prestige shows such as Pachinko, Foundation, The Morning Show, Severance
No ads
All originals stream with 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos
Cheap monthly rate
Cons
Small selection of titles
Lack of older content
Limited Android support
Apple TV Plus is the lowest-priced premium, ad-free streaming service available at $10 a month. It does come with high-end features like 4K resolution, HDR and mobile downloads, but it's also the one service on this list that includes only original content, and no regular back catalog of shows or movies to explore. It now has more than 50 exclusive, big-budget original programming shows and movies, but only a few have captured widespread attention, such as Ted Lasso and CODA, which won 2022's Oscar for best picture, along with Severance. Although the service is branching out with live Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer games, its library is far smaller than what you'll find with any of the other services on this list. The app can be confusing because it's housed in the larger Apple TV app with other content. However, Apple TV Plus is now available as a Prime Video add-on and on Android devices. It has one big advantage: There are a lot of ways to get it for free, at least for a while. If you're a degree-seeking college student, a new purchaser of an Apple device, or someone who subscribes to the Apple One bundle, you can snag a long-term free trial of Apple TV Plus.Who it's perfect for: Fans of prestige TV shows can get their fix without worrying about ads. There's also a small selection of kid-friendly titles on the service.Consider alternatives if: There's not an enormous library that's comparable to what Max carries from Warner Bros. or HBO, Disney's vault or Netflix's ever-growing stable of titles, so you may run out of things to watch after you enjoy a few series or movies.Popular titles: Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, Pachinko, For All Mankind  ...

Factors to consider
Simultaneous streams: Services usually charge more for more streams. Be sure you're covered for yourself and other members of your household, and consider whether you have to pay extra to share your account.Finding shows and movies: Is the interface user-friendly on TVs and mobile devices? All of these services have organized home screens with recommendation rows, continue-watch sections, and genre hubs.The ad experience: When we tested ad loads for these services, we found that platforms like Hulu and Paramount ran ad breaks longer than the others. Additionally, there are services that don't include ads on kids' profiles, such as HBO Max, Netflix and Hulu. A downside for the ad-supported tiers on Netflix and Disney Plus is that these plans exclude select titles.Kids' programming: Some streamers offer a large variety of family-friendly titles for all ages, while others, like Apple TV Plus, have limited catalogs. The best kids' streaming services have something for every age. Save money with bundles: You can cut your costs by choosing to bundle your streaming services together, such as Comcast's StreamSaver, a Disney Bundle or with a food delivery service. One of the best offerings available right now is the HBO Max-Disney package, but new bundles are constantly being introduced. How we test streaming services
Chances are you're already pretty familiar with most of the names on this list, but it's by no means comprehensive. There are plenty of other ways to stream and hundreds of other choices available. As we evaluated these particular streaming options, we kept certain things in mind.  This list is ordered based on the numerical value I assigned to each streaming service in their individual review, which I determined by design (i.e. ease of use across different TV and mobile platforms), features (like 4K HDR, mobile downloads, recommendations, watch lists and number of streams), content (frequency and number of shows and quality of originals and back catalogs) and value (price compared to these other factors). We stream using a Roku stick, smart TV, Apple TV box, mobile phone, tablet and Fire TV stick.
Aaron Pruner/CNETEach platform offers the same standard features on the home screen, and we found that HBO Max, Disney Plus and Hulu excel with dedicated hubs and collections, while Netflix's recommendation rows for current, older and upcoming picks combined and genre-based organization are superior. Subtle features are also a plus, like the ability to share titles via text from HBO Max and Netflix, or Netflix's 'Moments' functionality that lets you save scenes from your favorite titles. We also measure ad time on ad-based plans and look for glitches during playback. See each service's reviews for full details. Streaming Services FAQ
