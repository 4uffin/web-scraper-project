Eagles vs. Chiefs Livestream: How to Watch NFL Week 2 Online Today
How to watch Eagles vs. Chiefs on Fox
There are usually a couple games in the late window on Sunday afternoon, but this Week 2 matchup is so tasty that the NFL has made it a national broadcast. It's Jalen Hurts and the Philly Tush Push going up against the magic of Patrick Mahomes and the Andy Reid-led Chiefs, and it's going to be awesome. It's also a Super Bowl rematch. The Eagles won the title last season by blowing out the Chiefs, who were coming off back-to-back Super Bowl titles of their own. So, the winners of the past three Super Bowls are playing in this game. The Eagles picked right up where they left off last year and started the season with a win in primetime against the Dallas Cowboys. The Chiefs stumbled out of the gate and lost to the LA Chargers in Brazil. The Chiefs get the Eagles at home, and Arrowhead is a tough place for visitors, but a loss to the Eagles would mean an 0-2 start for the Chiefs, who lost only two regular-season games all of last year.
The Kansas Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles meet in Week 2 for a Super Bowl rematch. Andy Lewis/Icon Sportswire/Getty ImagesThe Eagles and Chiefs kick off Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET (1:25 p.m. PT) on Fox. Here's how you can watch or stream it live without a cable or satellite TV subscription.Read more: How to Watch NFL Games Without Cable in 2025
