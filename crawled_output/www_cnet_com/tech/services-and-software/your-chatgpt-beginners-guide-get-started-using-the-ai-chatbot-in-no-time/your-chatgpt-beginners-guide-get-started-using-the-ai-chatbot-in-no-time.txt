ChatGPT can do more than just answer your questions. James Martin/CNET
As we approach the third anniversary of ChatGPT's breakthrough moment, the AI chatbot has become an institution. It has about 700 million weekly users -- which means roughly 7 billion people still need to get up to speed.
If you're ready to give ChatGPT a try, you'll be joining throngs of people using it for work, but even more so in their personal lives. Common uses include finding information and getting help with writing, according to new research from ChatGPT maker OpenAI. AI chatbots in general offer new ways to organize information, create content and simplify everyday tasks.
It does help to know the basics of how ChatGPT works so you can navigate the growing ecosystem with confidence. Think of this as your crash course in ChatGPT. We'll walk through what it is, how to use it, and the essentials you need to know if you're just getting started with AI chatbots.With that in mind, here's your ChatGPT 101 class. Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)What can ChatGPT do for you? A lotChatGPT can answer your questions, summarize text, write new content, code and translate languages. Depending on what version you're using, it can either browse the internet or generate information up until its last training model date.
It's not magic, it's math: The results are based on the large language model's predictions and past information, making it prone to hallucinations, errors and biases.Keep a balanced approach when using tools like ChatGPT. AI, like most cutting-edge tech, is neither all good nor all bad. Avoid being too dogmatic on either side.I've tried using ChatGPT for everything from work-related tasks like creating a resume and a cover letter, looking for a dream job and negotiating a raise, to personal things like saving time and being more productive, finding the best deals and coupons while shopping online and even creating recipes from my leftovers.First: Get set up with ChatGPTYou can use ChatGPT as a search engine, much like Google's home page. Go to chatgpt.com or download the ChatGPT app on Apple's App Store or on the Google Play Store.Open the app or website, and type in your question or prompt. You can use the voice function, attach files and even browse trending topics under Search.
ChatGPT/Screenshot by Amanda Smith/CNETFor more advanced and personalized features, it's best to create an account and log in. ChatGPT knows more about you through your search history, and you can customize ChatGPT's responses. To create an account, click on the Sign Up button in the top right-hand corner. Choose between a free or premium membership ($20 a month). In many instances, the free version is fine.For quick personal searches, you might want to use the app. For work, the desktop version is probably easier. And if you're using the voice button instead of typing your prompt, the mobile app is best. Second: Get comfortable with ChatGPTThere's no one "right" way to use ChatGPT. The only wrong way to use it is to only use ChatGPT and to outsource your critical thinking to it. Use ChatGPT and Google, and always fact check everything they both tell you. Click on the sources of information that Google and ChatGPT are drawing from. You can't simply trust the info AI gives you -- it may be hallucinating, or drawing the wrong conclusions from doubtful source information.It's also helpful to come to AI tools with your intention in mind. For example, you could use ChatGPT as a thinking partner or a research aid. Give it a "job" and build it into your process, rather than it replacing all your research. Read more: ChatGPT Glossary: 56 AI Terms Everyone Should KnowWhat can you ask ChatGPT?You can ask ChatGPT almost anything -- just avoid ever giving it any personal or sensitive information, such as your credit card number, SSN or any personally identifying information in case of data breaches. For whatever you're asking ChatGPT, the more context you give, the better. You only get out what you put in, so focus on providing as much information as possible in your first prompt.Your prompt will depend on whether you're asking a question, summarizing text, brainstorming, getting "advice," analyzing images, sourcing code or generating content. If you're not sure where to start, here are a couple of things I've asked for ChatGPT to help me with. Let's compare my two search intentions: Advice-related requestsI'm trying to get pregnant and want to know the ideal diet for my situation. Example prompt: "I'm a 36-year-old woman getting ready to start IVF. I have no fertility issues, but my AMH is on the lower end. Provide a suggested diet to follow in the lead-up to my egg retrieval and transfer."It will give you a lot of information. Most of it won't be personalized to you, so think of it as a conversation where each follow-up prompt gets you closer to customized advice. You can see an example of this exact advice-related prompt here, and all the follow-up questions I had to ask to drill down to get helpful information. Just remember: If you're asking for health and wellness information, always double-check with a doctor.Data-related requestsSay you're a small business owner and want to reduce your overhead, so you input your expenses spreadsheet into ChatGPT for advice.
ChatGPT/Screenshot by Amanda Smith/CNETYou could click on the Analyze data button and it will generate prompts. Pick the most appropriate, or type in after "help me…"Example prompt: "Help me save money on my expenses. Attached is my expenses list for last year." Again, double-check every number the AI tool comes back with.Try a ChatGPT samplerIf you just want to play around with the tool before using it to ask specific questions, you can use the automatically generated prompts that come up in ChatGPT. For example, if you click on Surprise me, you can explore prompts like this:
ChatGPT/Screenshot by Amanda Smith/CNETI clicked on one of the suggested prompts and here's the answer I got:
ChatGPT/Screenshot by Amanda Smith/CNETIf you click on Make a plan, you can explore prompts like "make a plan to get a promotion," "make a plan to buy a new car," "make a plan of meals for the week" and "make a plan for a weekend in New York." For the meal plan suggestion, for instance, give ChatGPT a quick input of ingredients in the fridge and your current diet focus, and it will generate a meal plan for the week. You can be as custom as uploading a photo of what's in your fridge and asking for a dinner suggestion, or as straightforward as asking ChatGPT for some good restaurant options in New York. This meal planning example really shows how ChatGPT and other AI tools are a "choose your own adventure" and handy search partner for anything you want to do with them.Just remember to maintain a balanced view of these tools. And always double-check its advice.
