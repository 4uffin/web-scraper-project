How to watch Seahawks vs. Cardinals game
Can I watch the Seahawks-Cardinals game on local TV?
It's the battle of the birds tonight in Arizona. The Seahawks and Cardinals are each off to a good start at 2-1, but are looking up in the NFC West standings at the undefeated San Francisco 49ers. The Cardinals must rebound on a short week after losing on a last-second field goal to the 49ers last Sunday. Meanwhile, the Seahawks have won two straight after dropping their opening game to the 49ers after giving up a touchdown in the final 2 minutes.The Hawks and Cards kick off tonight at 8:15 p.m. ET (5:15 p.m. PT). The game will stream nationally on Prime Video and free on Twitch. Fans in the Seattle and Arizona markets can watch on a local TV station but the rest of the country will need to stream it on Prime Video or Twitch.
Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals host the Seattle Seahawks tonight for Thursday Night Football on Prime Video and Twitch. Kavin Mistry/Getty ImagesHow to watch Seahawks vs. Cardinals gameTonight's game will stream nationally on Prime Video, giving NFL fans more incentive than free two-day shipping to sign up for an Amazon Prime account, which costs $15 a month or $139 a year. You can also subscribe only to Prime Video for $9 a month.If you don't pay for either of Amazon's services you can watch free on Prime Video's Twitch channel. (Twitch is also owned by Amazon.)You can also use NFL Plus, the league's $7-per-month streaming service (or $15 a month with Red Zone included), to stream the game without subscribing to Prime or Prime Video. Note that NFL Plus viewing is limited to watching on just a phone or tablet, not on a computer or TV.

Thursday Night Football for $9 a month
You can watch tonight's game and the rest of the Thursday Night Football slate this season on Prime Video. For millions of Amazon Prime subscribers, the Prime Video channel is already included at no extra cost. But if you're not an Amazon Prime subscriber, it might be worth it to shell out the $9 a month for the stand-alone Prime Video service, not only for football but also its impressive selection of shows and movies.Read our Prime Video review.

Can I watch the Seahawks-Cardinals game on local TV?Yes, Hawks and Cards fans in the local markets of each team will be able to watch the game on an over-the-air station. For this game, that's Fox 13 (KCPQ) in Seattle and Fox 10 (KSAZ) in Phoenix, according to 506 Sports. There are two ways to watch local channels on your TV without cable or satellite TV. The first is with a live TV streaming service. The second is with an over-the-air antenna if you live in an area with good reception.Each of the five major live TV streaming services carry Fox but not every service carries every local network, so check each one using the links below to make sure it carries Fox in your area.
