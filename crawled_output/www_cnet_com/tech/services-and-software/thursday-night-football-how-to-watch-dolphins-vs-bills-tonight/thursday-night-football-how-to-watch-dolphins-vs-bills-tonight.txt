Thursday Night Football: How to Watch Dolphins vs. Bills Tonight
How to watch Dolphins vs. Bills game
Can I watch the Dolphins-Bills game on local TV?
The Dolphins haven't won in Buffalo since 2016 and that streak is almost certain to continue for another year. The seat is getting hot for Miami head coach Mike McDaniel with the team off to an 0-2 start. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa looked better in last week's loss but is likely to struggle on the road against the Bills' defense. And the Dolphins are going to need to find a way to score points because Buffalo's offense looks unstoppable behind league MVP Josh Allen.The game kicks off tonight at 8:15 p.m. ET (5:15 p.m. PT). It will stream nationally on Prime Video and free on Twitch. Fans in the Miami and Buffalo markets can watch on a local TV station but the rest of the country will need to stream it on Prime Video or Twitch.
Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills host the Miami Dolphins tonight for Thursday Night Football on Prime Video and Twitch. Michael Owens/Getty ImagesHow to watch Dolphins vs. Bills gameTonight's game will stream nationally on Prime Video, giving NFL fans more incentive than free two-day shipping to sign up for an Amazon Prime account, which costs $15 a month or $139 a year. You can also subscribe only to Prime Video for $9 a month.If you don't pay for either of Amazon's services you can watch free on Prime Video's Twitch channel. (Twitch is also owned by Amazon.)You can also use NFL Plus, the league's $7-per-month streaming service (or $15 a month with Red Zone included), to stream the game without subscribing to Prime or Prime Video. Note that NFL Plus viewing is limited to watching on just a phone or tablet, not on a computer or TV.

TNF for $9 a month
You can watch tonight's game and the rest of the TNF slate this season on Prime Video. For millions of Amazon Prime subscribers, the Prime Video channel is already included at no extra cost. But if you're not an Amazon Prime subscriber, it might be worth it to shell out the $9 a month for the stand-alone Prime Video service, not only for football but also its impressive selection of shows and movies.Read our Prime Video review.

Can I watch the Dolphins-Bills game on local TV?Yes, Dolphins and Bills fans in the local markets of each team will be able to watch the game on an over-the-air station. For this game, that's CBS 4 (WFOR) in Miami and ABC 7 (WKBW) in Buffalo, according to 506 Sports. There are two ways to watch local channels on your TV without cable or satellite TV. The first is with a live TV streaming service. The second is with an over-the-air antenna if you live in an area with good reception.Each of the five major live TV streaming services carry Fox but not every service carries every local network, so check each one using the links below to make sure it carries Fox in your area.
