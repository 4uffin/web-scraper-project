11 Hidden iOS 18.5 Features I Love

iOS 18 introduced a redesigned Control Center and several optimization options for the home screen. Viva Tung/CNET
Apple announced all of the new features for its next iPhone at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference. With  iOS 26 (yes, iOS 26, not iOS 19) the tech giant is adding a gaming app and redesigning the interface. This doesn't mean that iOS 18.5 isn't worth exploring.
If you're feeling brave and are experienced enough to try out iOS 26 now, you can download the developer beta, but most iPhone owners will want to wait for Apple to release the fully baked version of iOS later this year. Until then, there's a whole host of cool features for the current version of iOS -- 18.5.From the revamped Control Center and adjustable flashlight beam to customizable battery charging, I've chosen a few of my favorite hidden iOS 18.5 features you should know about now.

Restart your iPhone from the new control centerIf you're running iOS 18, you don't have to press any physical buttons to restart your iPhone. The redesigned control center features all the classic controls you're used to, like brightness, volume, orientation, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, but there are several new controls, including one to restart your iPhone.All you need to do is swipe down from the top-right of your iPhone and press and hold down on the new power button in the top-right of the control center. You can't just tap it; you have to hold it down for a second or so, and then the slider to power off your iPhone will appear. To turn your iPhone back on, you'll still need to press and hold the physical side button.
On iOS 17 and earlier, the only way to restart your iPhone is to press and hold either volume button and the side button. Nelson Aguilar/CNETUse a QR code to share your Wi-Fi passwordThere are a few ways you can share a Wi-Fi network and password with people via your iPhone, and there's a new way to do it on iOS 18. Using a QR code fills in a few gaps for ways to quickly share your Wi-Fi information:Share with several people at once. Instead of individually sending out your Wi-Fi password, you can have everyone scan the QR code from your phone.Share with someone not saved as your contact. Nearby share for Wi-Fi doesn't work unless that person is in your contacts.Share with someone who has Android. Nearby share and AirDrop don't work with Android devices.
Watch this: Introducing iOS 26 at WWDC25
04:37
If you encounter any of those scenarios and don't want to text the Wi-Fi password to them, you can use the QR code. Go to the new Passwords app, go to the Wi-Fi section, tap on the network you want to share and then hit Show Network QR Code. If the other person scans the QR code with their camera, they'll be connected to the Wi-Fi network.
This only works for Wi-Fi passwords, not regular passwords. Nelson Aguilar/CNETAdjust the beam width of your flashlightThe flashlight on the iPhone is getting a big upgrade. You've long been able to change the intensity of the flashlight, but on iOS 18 you can now also adjust the beam width of the light, as long as you have a compatible model. You can go wide, to cover more area with less light, or go narrow, to use more intense light over less area, and everywhere in between. It's a fun feature to play around with for lighting people for photos.To use the new feature, turn on your flashlight (use the lock screen or control center), and a new user interface will appear on the dynamic island. You can change the light intensity by swiping up and down, but to change the beam width, you'll need to swipe left and right. If you tap anywhere in the dynamic island, you can turn the flashlight off and on.
A wide flashlight beam (left) and a narrow beam. Nelson Aguilar/CNETNote: This feature only works on iPhone models with the dynamic island, including the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro, ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro Max, iPhone 15 series and iPhone 16 series.Quickly turn off AI notification summaries for certain apps from your lock screenIn iOS 18.1, Apple introduced notification summaries -- Apple Intelligence-powered notifications that summarize your notifications from a single app. If you have multiple unread notifications from an app like Gmail or Amazon, you'll see an italicized summary appear on your lock screen, condensing them all into a few sentences you can quickly digest.However, notification summaries don't always work very well, especially for text messages and news apps. In fact, as of iOS 18.3, notification summaries are disabled for all news apps across your device, like the Apple News and CNET app. But if you want to disable the feature for other apps, you can easily do so without even unlocking your phone.From your lock screen, find a notification summary for an app you want the feature disabled for and swipe left on the notification. Tap on Options and then hit Turn Off "App Name" Summaries to stop notification summaries for that app. You'll continue to receive notifications, they'll just be individual, like you're used to.
You can see that notification summaries are italicized on iOS 18.3 Nelson Aguilar/CNETShare your AirTag with other peopleAn AirTag allows you to easily track your luggage when you're traveling or your keys when they're lost, but sometimes you might want other people to also be able to track your AirTag, especially if you're on a family vacation or weekend getaway with your partner. With iOS 18, you can now share any AirTag you have with up to six people.Don't miss: 5 Clever Hiding Spots for Your Apple AirTagsTo do this, go into the Find My app and find the AirTag you want to share. Go into the AirTag, hit Add Person under Share AirTag and choose a contact, or several. Finally tap Share in the top-right and that person will then have to accept your invitation. Once they do, they'll be able to track your AirTag from their Apple device.
Anyone that is tracking the AirTag won't be notified when it's near them. Nelson Aguilar/CNETCustomize your iPhone's charging limit to improve the battery's lifespanYour iPhone already has a feature that's designed to improve your battery's lifespan. Optimized Battery Charging learns your daily charging routine to reduce the time your phone is fully charged, delaying charging past 80% while you sleep and then charging to 100% only when you need it.However, if you want to prolong your iPhone's battery lifespan even more, you can manually change your charging option to anywhere from 80% to 100%, so that your iPhone never fully charges. Go to Settings > Battery > Charging and choose an option.
Optimized Battery Charging disables whenever you choose an option under 100%, which just means that your phone won't automatically wait to finish charging to 100%, because it can't. Nelson Aguilar/CNETIf you choose anything lower than 100%, that's the highest percentage your battery will charge to. The benefit of that is that lithium-ion batteries, like the one in your iPhone, degrade faster when consistently charged to 100%, so keeping the charge lower reduces stress on the battery.Transcribe Voice Memos and make them searchableThe Voice Memos app is incredibly convenient for capturing ideas or song snippets, but they've always been obfuscated. You can give them a descriptive title, but that doesn't help when you want to find that one memo you recorded that contains the word "porcupine." In iOS 18, the app can create transcriptions of your voice memos and search for words that were previously available only as audio waveforms.In the Voice Memos app, tap one of your memos to reveal its controls and then tap the Edit Recording button, which looks like a waveform. Or, tap the three-dots button to the right of a memo and choose Edit Recording.Next, tap the Transcribe button to create the transcription (or view the text if it's already been transcribed). Tap Done.
Take an existing voice memo (left) and create a transcript of the recording (right). Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNETNow, when you use the Search field, the app looks through the transcripts in addition to the titles for results. The text is also available throughout iOS. When you perform a search from the home screen, you'll see Voice Memos as a category with the memos that include the search term (you may need to tap Show More Results to reveal it).
With transcripts made, voice memos are more easily searchable. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNETHide app labels for a cleaner home screenIs your home screen feeling a little too cluttered? If so, this new feature could help. Now with iOS 18, you can get rid of app labels or the names of the apps that you see underneath each app icon on your home screen. If you can recognize an app from just the icon, who needs the label?On your home screen, press and hold down on any blank space, until you enter jiggle mode, and then hit Edit > Customize. A menu will appear at the bottom of the screen; choose the Large option, which will make your app icons slightly larger and remove the app labels.
This will also remove the app labels from the folders in the App Library. Nelson Aguilar/CNETUse AI to get priority notifications on your lock screenAs long as you have an Apple Intelligence-supported phone, you can enable a new feature to get notifications that AI thinks may be important in a separate section on your lock screen. The prioritized notifications appear at the top of your notification stack, glowing in color.To enable Priority Notifications, go to Settings > Notifications > Prioritize Notifications and toggle the feature on. Notifications like missed calls, text messages and important emails will fill up this section, as well as notifications from third-party apps that you use frequently.
You'll see missed calls, text messages and notifications from your most used apps in this new Priority Notifications section at the top of your lock screen. Nelson Aguilar/CNETChange an app to a widget without leaving the home screenNot every iOS app has a widget for your home screen, but if it does, you don't need to dig through the widget edit page to find it. If you're running iOS 18, and there's an app that you want to turn into a widget, you can do so very quickly right from your home screen.On a supported app, press and hold down on the icon on your home screen to bring up the quick actions menu. If the app has a widget, you'll see an app icon next to a variety of widget icons (up to three). Tap on any of the widget icons to change the app to a widget. If you want to go back from the widget to the app, go to the quick action menu and hit the app icon on the left.
This only works for apps that have widgets on iOS. Nelson Aguilar/CNETSecretly identify songs using the Action ButtonNo lie, it's satisfying when someone asks, "What song is this?" to be able to activate Music Recognition on the iPhone and get an answer quickly. To get the answer means very noticeably asking Siri to run Shazam or activate Music Recognition in the control center. Wouldn't it be fun to let your friends think you've been blessed with an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music?In iOS 18, you can come close using the Action Button. Go to Settings > Action Button and swipe through the options until Recognize Music is selected.
Assign the Recognize Music feature to the Action Button and then identify songs by just holding the button. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNETTo make it work, just press and hold the Action Button for a couple of seconds. Shazam appears on the dynamic island to listen to what's playing and identify the song. If you're sneaky about activating Shazam and peeking at your phone, no one needs to know you got some help from a supercomputer in the cloud.Find images with handwriting and illustrations in the Photos appA lot is changing in the Photos app in iOS 18, from the way things are organized to the ability to use generative AI to remove objects in images. Apple has also tucked a few surprises into the app to help you sort through your library.Scroll down past the main library itself to view categories such as People and Pets and Memories until you reach Utilities. Tap it to view the full list -- but note that a new feature of this interface is the ability to swipe left to view additional panels. Prior to iOS 18, Utilities included options to view hidden, recently deleted and duplicate photos.Now, it includes many more options. Tap Handwriting to view images with handwriting in them. Looking for images that are illustrations and not photographs? Tap Illustrations (although in our testing this seems to grab a lot of screenshots too).
View images that contain handwriting in your Photos library in iOS 18. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNETShare a specific section of a podcastDid the hosts of your favorite podcast say something especially funny or thoughtful that you want to share with someone? In the Podcasts app in iOS 18, you can send an episode to a friend with the playback advanced to that moment -- but the capability isn't easy to find.Tap the Now Playing bar in the app at the bottom of the screen to view the playback controls and pause the episode. Use the progress bar to go back to the start of the section you want to share.Next, tap the More (…) button and choose Share Episode. In the sharing options that appear, tap From Start below the episode title, and then select From [the current time]. Tap Done.
Start by sharing the episode itself. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNETLastly, choose the method of sharing, such as via Messages or Mail. When the recipient receives the shared episode and opens it in the Podcasts app, they'll see the option to Play from [the time].
Specify that the shared episode begins at the time you chose. Screenshot by Jeff Carlson/CNET
