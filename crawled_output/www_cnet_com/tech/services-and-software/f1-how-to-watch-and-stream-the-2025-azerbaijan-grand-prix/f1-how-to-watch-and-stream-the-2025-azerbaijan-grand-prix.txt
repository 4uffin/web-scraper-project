When and where are the races?
The drivers head to the Caspian Sea coast for Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix in the midst of controversy surrounding McLaren's actions last time out at Monza. Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the race as it happens, wherever you are in the world. While Red Bull's Max Verstappen had a superb weekend in Lombardy, setting a new all-time F1 speed record in qualifying before claiming victory in the Italian Grand Prix, those feats were somewhat overshadowed by the fallout after McLaren ordered Driver's Championship leader Oscar Piastri to allow his teammate and title rival Lando Norris to pass him.That call ultimately allowed Norris finish in second in front of Piastri, reducing the latter's championship lead by three points to 31. This ensures that the title race is on a knife's edge ahead of a Grand Prix that's renowned for its unpredictability.Making its 10th appearance on the F1 calendar this year, the Baku City Circuit has consistently delivered some of the most thrilling races of recent seasons, thanks in large part to its unusually long, slipstream-friendly main straight along the city's shoreline coupled with a notoriously wide Turn 1 that invites risky overtaking.The Azerbaijan GP takes place at the Baku City Circuit on Sunday, Sept. 21, at 3 p.m. AZT local time. Starting time in the US and Canada is 7 a.m. ET (4 a.m. PT). In the UK that's a 12 p.m. BST start. Australian viewers will be looking at a 9 p.m. AEST start.The entire race weekend, including practice sessions and qualifying, will be shown in the US on ESPN's family of TV and streaming networks. Folks who want to follow the whole race weekend will need access to the ABC and ESPN news channels on cable or live TV streaming services, or the ESPN Plus streaming service.
The Azerbaijan GP's Baku City Circuit passes the Maiden Tower, one of the city's most famous landmarks. Clive Mason/Getty ImagesLivestream the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in the USEvery Formula One race during the 2025 season will be televised on ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. All practice and qualifying sessions and all F1 Sprint events also will be broadcast. This race will be carried on ESPN. Selected races will also stream on ESPN Plus, featuring two alternate streams for all races (Driver Tracker and mixed onboard cameras).

ESPN Plus
Carries F1 races in the US
ESPN's standalone streaming service is great for casual fans of F1 and is a must-have accessory for fanatics. It costs $12 a month or $120 a year. If you're an F1 fan who's also looking to get your Disney fix, the Disney trio bundle (Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus) might end up being an even better buy. It's great for fans who love catching the parts of the race weekend that typically air on ESPN2 or ESPNews, and also want the latest Marvel movies or Star Wars shows.If you're a diehard fan of motorsports and Formula Series racing, ESPN Plus might not be for you, given that it rarely covers F2, F3 or Porsche Supercar racing. That's why ESPN Plus is ideal for casual fans who enjoy catching a race every once in a while or fans who don't want or need all of the extra bells and whistles of F1 TV but want to beef up their coverage options. Read our full review of ESPN Plus.
