How we test
What to Consider
Server specs
Look for a plan with good processing power and RAM to prevent lag, plus enough storage to accommodate the Minecraft world you're trying to build.
Location
Your game will run faster if your computer's retrieving data from a server near your geographical location rather than a server stored on the other side of the world.
Ease of use
Look for a Minecraft server host with an easy-to-use control panel that you can use to make adjustments to your server as needed.
Security
Your Minecraft server should be secured with a firewall to keep out malware and DDoS protection to prevent your server from being overwhelmed by malicious traffic.
Customer service
You should be able to access customer service 24/7 through your preferred method of communication (live chat, phone or email). Some companies may offer multiple methods of communication.

Add to compareFactors to consider when choosing a Minecraft server host
Server specs and resource allocationYour server needs to have enough resources to run your game smoothly for the number of players you want/expect to have in your server. There are three resource types to pay attention to here:Central Processing Unit or CPU - Minecraft relies primarily on the CPU to execute its instructions. The FPS -- Frames Per Second -- rate may be limited if the server's CPU isn't powerful enough. Ideal CPU power depends on the number of players you want to include. Requirements also vary based on the server's operating system.Random Access Memory or RAM - RAM determines response times, how much of the Minecraft environment you can load at once, and the number of players you can have before your server slows down. Heavy resource packs may also influence the amount of RAM you need. You'll require a minimum of 1GB of RAM for one to four players and 2GB for five to 10 players.Storage - This determines how much world information you can store and how many backups you can create. You'll need at least 2GB of empty space for one to two players and 10GB of empty space for three to five players.Exact resource requirements vary based on the number of players you're going to host on your server, the operating system of your server and the resource packs you're using. There are many online resources, like the Minecraft Fandom site, where you can find information on the resources your server will need for your exact game setup. You can also reach out to customer service for any host you're considering to learn about the types of games their servers are capable of supporting.LocationYour host should let you choose a data center close to your location to store your server on. This will improve loading speeds and ensure that your game runs smoothly. If you're running a game with international players, ask the host you're considering about the steps they take to ensure that the game will run smoothly for people in other locations. Ease of useYour Minecraft server host should provide an easy-to-use Control Panel where you can manage key aspects of your server. SecurityYour Minecraft server host should provide a firewall, DDoS protection and anti-virus software to keep your game secure and protect your players' data.Customer serviceLook for 24/7 customer service accessible via live chat and email. You may also want to choose a host with phone support. How we test the best third-party Minecraft server hosts
Angela Lang/CNETIt's important to note that we didn't explicitly "test" the Minecraft hosting provider options on this list. Instead, we compiled a competitive overview based on a variety of factors, including third-party ratings and features offered by each hosting company. We've also weighted the rankings of these businesses by the Better Business Bureau and TrustPilot. With that data in hand, we split them into two tiers: Best Minecraft hosting providers (top tier): These Minecraft host vendors all have a rating of A or higher from the nonprofit Better Business Bureau (except in cases when the companies are based outside of North America and not included in the BBB ranking system) and a rating of 4.0 or higher out of 5 from TrustPilot, a Danish consumer review site. All of the TrustPilot rankings are based on at least 1,000 user reviews. All of the vendors listed in our top picks also say they offer 24/7 support and modpack support. Other Minecraft hosting options to consider (second tier): All of these Minecraft host vendors have TrustPilot ratings of 4.0 or above; those ratings are based on fewer than 1,000 user reviews. Some have low ratings from the BBB that are worth taking a look at before making your decision or do not have a BBB page due to location. Important caveats: The Better Business Bureau is not affiliated with any government agency and does not rate companies outside of North America. To be BBB Accredited, companies pay a fee to the organization. TrustPilot, meanwhile, also offers a paid tier that provides companies more interaction with their user ratings. It also removed 2.2 million fake reviews in 2020.A note on pricing: We've made every effort to verify that the prices listed here were accurate at the time of last publication, but prices in this category are subject to frequent fluctuations and are also consistently subject to special offers and limited deals. Further, many of the prices listed here reflect the monthly rates if you prepay for 12 months of service or are limited-time introductory prices. Please check the vendors in question to verify pricing at any given time. Other unofficial Minecraft hosting options to consider
The following Minecraft server hosts have slightly lower or fewer TrustPilot and/or BBB ratings than the ones above. BisectHostingBisectHosting offers 25 different plans, each with an option for a budget or premium package. The budget Minecraft hosting plan costs $3 a month for 2GB of RAM and go up to around $144 a month for 48GB of RAM. Premium plans range from $10 a month to about $240 a month, with the same amounts of RAM as their budget counterparts but with more locations and free daily backups, modpack updates, sponge installation and a dedicated IP address. BisectHosting has a B- rating from the BBB, but it also has a TrustPilot rating of 4.7 out of 5 with almost 10,000 reviews. See all BisectHosting plansNodecraftNodecraft also offers Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition server hosting, starting at around $6 a month.

Minecraft server hosting FAQ
What is the best Minecraft server host?
Hostinger is the best Minecraft server host, with excellent server performance during our hands-on test and a 4.6 out of five star Trustpilot ranking based on over 30,000 reviews.
Show more
What is the best amount of RAM for a Minecraft server?
The amount of RAM you need for a Minecraft server depends on the number of players you'll have. You'll need 1GB for 1-4 players, 2GB for 5-10 players and more RAM for larger servers.
Show more
Is two CPU cores enough for a Minecraft server?
Two CPU cores may be enough to run a small Minecraft server. Many experts recommend using more cores, especially if you plan to have more than a few players on your server.
Show more
What is the best free 24/7 Minecraft server host?
ScalaCube offers the best free Minecraft server hosting plan, with 6GB of RAM and 30GB of storage. ScalaCube's free plan also features advanced DDoS protection and a 99.99% uptime. However, you'll only be able to have two players on a Java server or one player on a Bedrock server. This makes it great for building the basics of a Minecraft world, but you'll need to upgrade to a paid plan if you want to play with a group. You won't need to pay much, though -- ScalaCube's premium plans start at just $2 a month.
Show more
How much does a 24/7 Minecraft server cost?
You can get a 24/7 Minecraft server for free, but it will come with strict limitations. Premium plans offer more flexibility for as little as $2 per month.
Show more
Do I need an IP address to host a Minecraft server?
No, you don't need an IP address to host a Minecraft server. However, a dedicated IP address can be worthwhile if you want to build a professional server, as it allows you to do things like building a public presence for your server.
