These films will satisfy scary movie lovers.
Meara Isenberg Writer Meara covers streaming service news for CNET. She graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in journalism. When she's not writing, she likes to dote over her cat, sip black coffee and try out new horror movies.

With horror flicks like Nosferatu, Speak No Evil and Smile 2, Prime Video might have something up your spooky alley. The streaming service is ad-supported but if the idea of watching commercials sends a chill down your spine, you can pay an extra monthly fee to remove them.Here are some highly rated horror films to satisfy your cravings. Dim the lights, grab the popcorn and enjoy your creepy feature.Watch on Prime Video
See at Prime Video
Paramount Pictures
Smile 2 (2024)
This follow-up to 2022's spine-chilling horror Smile plagues a new protagonist with a string of creepy grins. Naomi Scott stars as the tormented pop star Skye Riley. Petrifying experiences ramp up as she prepares for a new world tour.
Universal Pictures
Speak No Evil (2024)
Getting to know new friends can be fun. Or you could experience everything that happens in this horror movie. Starring James McAvoy as a sinister host, Speak No Evil offers an unsettling weekend getaway you won't easily forget.
Paramount Pictures
A Quiet Place: Day One (2024)
Aliens that kill based on sound populated the worlds of the post-apocalyptic horror films A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II. This spin-off prequel written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (John Krasinski helmed the originals) shows the creatures invading New York and stars Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn.
20th Century Studios
The First Omen (2024)
This flick stars a captivating Nell Tiger Free (Myrcella Baratheon in Game of Thrones) as an American woman working in Rome who uncovers a scheme to birth the Antichrist. It's a prequel to 1976's The Omen.
Lionsgate
American Psycho (2000)
In case you haven't yet been introduced to well-groomed investment banker Patrick Bateman, it's time to pull out your business card and get acquainted. Elements of dark comedy, thriller and horror are on display in this film, a satire of late '80s excess that stars Christian Bale as a wealthy young professional with murderous hobbies.
Prime Video
Totally Killer (2023)
Want to revisit the '80s? Kiernan Shipka time travels to the decade and takes on a killer in this new Prime Video slasher comedy. Randall Park and Julie Bowen also make appearances.
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre/YouTube
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)
Five friends cross paths with cannibalistic monsters -- including the chain saw-wielding Leatherface -- in this 1974 film directed by Tobe Hooper. The influential horror movie will thrill and disturb you.
Focus Features
Nosferatu (2024)
This stylish flick comes from Robert Eggers, who also directed The Witch, The Northman and The Lighthouse. A remake of the silent film Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, the haunting entry stars Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Willem Dafoe and Bill Skarsgård.
Amazon Studios
Nanny (2022)
Nanny is an increasingly unnerving movie about a mother working in the US and separated from her son in Senegal, whom she hopes will soon join her. The powerful, chilling film -- led by a captivating Anna Diop -- takes viewers through her difficult, haunting wait.
Amazon
Suspiria (2018)
If you like your horror films interspersed with a bit of contemporary dance (and who wouldn't!), then Suspiria is definitely the one for you. It tells the story of a supernatural dance academy run by a coven of witches and features themes like motherhood, guilt and abuse of power. An homage to the original 1977 film, Suspiria stars Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton.
Amazon Prime
Coherence (2014)
Coherence is a huge favorite here at CNET and it's a terrifying watch. Not necessarily in the traditional, gory, horrific sense but more in terms of the concepts. It's a multiverse movie released before multiverses were cool and is not what you expect. Coherence is the kind of movie you'll finish and immediately rewatch to try to rewire your brain. It's a fantastic achievement and a must watch.
