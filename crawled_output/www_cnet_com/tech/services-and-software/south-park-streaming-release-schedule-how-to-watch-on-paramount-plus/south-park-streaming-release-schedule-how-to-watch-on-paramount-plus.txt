South Park season 27, episode 5 release date and streaming details
Comedy CentralIf you've been around for the start of South Park season 27, you know its rollout has been hectic. That pattern is continuing with the debut of episode 5, which was previously scheduled to air on Comedy Central on Wednesday, Sept. 17. The new installment will now air on Sept. 24, which is three weeks after the last episode.An X post included a message from South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. "Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don't get it done," the message said. "This one's on us. We didn't get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!"A note regarding tonight’s previously scheduled episode. South Park To Continue On Wednesday, September 24th At 10pm ET/PT On Comedy Central. pic.twitter.com/00WNNLOA2G— South Park (@SouthPark) September 17, 2025
While it's been hard to predict release dates for South Park season 27, another aspect of the show is more definitive: its new streaming home. With the signing of a deal in July, 50 new South Park episodes and the show's back catalog will be on Comedy Central and Paramount Plus. Forthcoming episodes of season 27 will stream on Paramount Plus in the US the day after airing on Comedy Central. The show is no longer available on HBO Max as of early August.If you want to watch the 27th season of the show, here's what to know. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome. South Park season 27, episode 5 release date and streaming details Episode 5 will air on Comedy Central on Wednesday, Sept. 24, at 10 p.m. ET, 10 p.m. PT or 9 p.m. CT and stream on Paramount Plus the next day (the first four episodes are already on the streaming service). In episode 5, "Kyle and Cartman are at odds when a prediction markets app gets popular with their fellow students," according to a post on X.The episode 5 shake-up resulted in a longer wait for a new episode, and it looks like that three-week hiatus will continue with episode 6. After that, South Park installments should return to airing every other week. Here are the dates to know.Episode 5: Airs on Comedy Central Sept. 24. Streams on Paramount Plus Sept. 25. Episode 6: Airs on Comedy Central Oct. 15. Streams on Paramount Plus Oct. 16.Episode 7: Airs on Comedy Central Oct. 29.
