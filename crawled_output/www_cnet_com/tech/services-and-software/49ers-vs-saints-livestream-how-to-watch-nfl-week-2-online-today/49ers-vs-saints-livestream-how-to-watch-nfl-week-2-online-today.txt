How to watch the 49ers vs. Saints game online from anywhere using a VPN
How to watch 49ers vs. Saints in the US
Quick tips for streaming the 49ers vs. Saints game using a VPN
The 49ers started the season with a win, but lost quarterback Brock Purdy in the process. With Purdy unlikely to play, backup Mac Jones is in line to start in New Orleans. Second-year QB Spencer Rattler is the Saints' starter, and helped keep them in the game last week before a late rally came up short in Arizona. Rattler started six games last year for New Orleans and is still looking for his first NFL win. The 49ers and Saints kick off at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) on Fox. Here's how you can watch or stream it live, even if the game isn't available on your local Fox channel. The game will be shown on TV in the San Francisco and New Orleans areas (according to 506 Sports) and on live TV streaming services, but there may be cases where you're blocked because of an internet location glitch. But there's an option that doesn't require subscribing to something like NFL Sunday Ticket or NFL Plus or searching the internet for a sketchy website: You can use a virtual private network.  Here's how you can watch the game from anywhere in the US with a VPN.

How to watch the 49ers vs. Saints game online from anywhere using a VPNIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally due to incorrectly applied blackout restrictions, you may need a different way to watch the game and that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, plus it's a great idea for when you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.
With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.
Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US and Canada, as long as you've got a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.
Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.

How to watch 49ers vs. Saints in the US
Sunday's 49ers vs. Saints game is on Fox. The good news for football fans is that Fox is available on all five major live TV streaming services, but not every service carries every local network, so check each one using the links below to make sure it carries Fox in your area. You can also stream games broadcast on Fox with the new Fox One streaming app.
Fox
Fox One: $20 per month
Sunday afternoon games on Fox
Fox's new direct-to-consumer streaming service launched in August. Fox One costs $20 a month or $200 a year and lets NFL fans watch their local Sunday afternoon games on Fox. You'll also get access to Fox's complete TV portfolio, including sports-related channels such as Fox Sports, B1G, FS1, FS2 and local Fox stations.

Sling Select
Carries Fox for $20 a month in select markets
Sling's new skinny bundle costs $20 and includes local Fox, ABC and NBC stations in select markets. It does not, however, offer CBS in any of its plans. It's also worth noting that Sling Select charges an extra fee of $5 or $10 in select markets for Fox in addition to the $20 base fee.   Sling also offers a Day Pass for $5 or a Weekend Pass for $10. If you also wanted to get ESPN in addition to the local networks, you would need to get the $61-a-month Sling Orange and Blue plan. Read our Sling TV review.

For $83 a month, you'll get all the major football channels with YouTube TV, including Fox. You can also add RedZone for an extra $11 per month. Plug in your ZIP code on YouTube TV's welcome page to see which local networks are available in your area.YouTube TV is also the exclusive home to NFL Sunday Ticket. But note that Sunday Ticket doesn't include local games. You can only watch Sunday afternoon games that aren't being broadcast on CBS or Fox in your area. If you want to watch all the football on Sundays you'll need Sunday Ticket plus a YouTube TV subscription (or just get Sunday Ticket and then use an antenna for local games).To get the full experience of your local games, NFL Sunday Ticket and NFL RedZone, you'll need the YouTube TV base plan ($83 per month), Sunday Ticket ($276 for returning subscribers or $480 for new subscribers for the season) and the Sports Plus add-on ($11 per month).

An over-the-air antenna connected to your TV provides another option for Fox. The best part about antennas is that there are no streaming or monthly fees required, although you will need to make sure you have good reception.
Quick tips for streaming the 49ers vs. Saints game using a VPN
With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- experience and success may vary. If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the "search for city or country" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.
