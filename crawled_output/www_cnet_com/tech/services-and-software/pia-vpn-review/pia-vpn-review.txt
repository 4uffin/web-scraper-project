PIA VPN Review: Privacy Basics on a Budget, but Underwhelming Speeds
Speed: Middling speed loss and lots of CAPTCHAs
Value: PIA is one of the cheapest VPNs available, but a little more money elsewhere gets you significantly faster speeds
PIA app performance: Highly customizable and largely user-friendly, yet slightly unrefined
Privacy and transparency: PIA prioritizes privacy
Final thoughts: PIA is a great cheap VPN, but it feels rough around the edges
While a bargain-bin DVD may not give you the sharpest picture or tons of special features, it still lets you watch the movie itself. Likewise, Private Internet Access may not be the fastest VPN or boast all the bells and whistles of its competitors, but it provides privacy basics on a budget. There are even some neat privacy features, like split tunneling on MacOS and Linux, but many of these may only be relevant for power users. Despite its wallet-friendly pricing, PIA remains privacy-forward, with unique offerings like open-source apps so anyone can inspect the source code for greater transparency. On the entertainment side, PIA is decent for unblocking region-restricted content, like foreign Netflix libraries or BBC iPlayer. And you’ll get unlimited simultaneous connections, which most pricier premium VPNs don't provide. To fully assess PIA, I ran over 250 internet speed tests, checked for DNS leaks, scrutinized its apps on many devices, pored over its privacy policy and communicated with the Private Internet Access team via email and video conference. In addition to running benchmarks, I used PIA for everyday tasks like streaming service unblocking to see how it fared as a daily driver VPN.But in my benchmarking, PIA’s middling internet speed loss made it unsuitable for folks with slow or unreliable internet. Its extremely customizable apps should satiate power users, but I didn’t find them the most user-friendly. During my daily usage, I frequently encountered CAPTCHAs, which bogged down my experience -- PIA tells me it plans to address this in 2025, and I’m eager to see the results of their efforts.Ultimately, PIA is a good cheap VPN, although it’s not the fastest or the most modern and polished. Speed: Middling speed loss and lots of CAPTCHAsAverage speed loss: 48% in March 2025 testsNumber of servers: 35,000-plusNumber of countries: 91PIA’s unreliable internet speed loss makes it OK for budget-conscious buyers with already fast internet but unsuitable for streaming fanatics or folks with slow internet connections.VPNs slow down your internet speeds because your data gets encrypted first rather than “talking” directly with your ISP’s servers -- it’s a minor tradeoff for beefing up your privacy. But the fastest VPNs, including NordVPN, Proton VPN and Surfshark, only reduce your internet download speeds by an average of 25% or less. In my 2025 PIA benchmarking, I clocked an average 48% internet download speed loss, which is almost identical to its 2024 performance. To put this into perspective, I generally get 300Mbps download speeds over Wi-Fi on my Google Fiber connection, so with PIA enabled, I might instead see 150Mbps -- usable for sure, but a far cry from my full bandwidth, which might matter if other devices are actively eating into that bandwidth.PIA’s server speeds fluctuated wildly Several factors influence internet speed loss with a VPN, including server load, VPN protocol and location. Typically, you’ll see faster speeds when tunneling through a VPN server physically located closer to you since your data doesn’t travel as far. For instance, I’ll usually pick a server in Charlotte, North Carolina, for optimal performance when connecting from my home office in North Carolina. Generally, the Wireguard VPN protocol is faster than OpenVPN, so to get the best speeds, you’d theoretically select Wireguard and a geographically close server. PIA’s speed results subverted my expectations, and I got slower speeds with Wireguard than OpenVPN on both Windows and MacOS. Likewise, speed tests often varied wildly from one set of benchmarks to the next. On one round of three internet speed tests, I measured an average 124Mbps download speed over a US New York server, then a 54Mbps average on the next bout. While some variability is expected based on different factors -- including server load based on the time of day -- our VPN testing process is designed to account for this, and we don’t normally encounter such drastic fluctuations. I’ve contacted PIA representatives for insight into the significant speed loss I measured, and they’re investigating. PIA plans to upgrade much of its server fleet from 1G to 10G servers in 2025, so you may encounter faster speeds over the course of the year, but that upgrade is fully rolled out. Admittedly, most people won’t be running over 250 internet speed tests, so internet speed fluctuations may not be as apparent during normal use. In real-world tests, I noticed some websites loading slower than I was used to. While streaming videos never stopped playing to buffer, I experienced some initial low-resolution playback on Windows and MacOS. The streaming experience on Android TV, Fire TV and Apple TV was smoother, with no noticeable video quality loss. PIA provides plenty of servers, but I ran into a lot of IP address quality issuesA generous global VPN server network benefits international travel, streaming service unblocking and potentially server speeds. PIA’s global footprint of 35,000 servers spread across 91 countries is in line with the industry standard -- most rivals, like ExpressVPN, Surfshark, NordVPN and Proton VPN offer thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. I was especially impressed by PIA’s US showing with servers in each of the 50 United States, making it a great choice for streaming NFL games. Despite its sizable server roster, I experienced many CAPTCHAs with apps and services -- and even Google Search -- when trying to use different servers. This isn’t unique to PIA; it’s a constant cat-and-mouse game between VPN providers and apps or websites, with IP addresses getting banned. While some folks found fewer CAPTCHAs with other search engines, like DuckDuckGo, you don’t want to switch apps purely because of your VPN. Your VPN should seamlessly slot into your daily usage, not dictate it. Nevertheless, I didn’t notice nearly the same amount of CAPTCHAs with alternatives, including NordVPN and Proton VPN. I filled out so many CAPTCHAs with PIA that I began asking myself questions like: “Does the rider’s helmet count as part of the motorcycle?” A PIA representative told me the company plans to address IP address quality in 2025, hopefully reducing the number of CAPTCHAs you might encounter. In the meantime, if you encounter many CAPTCHAs like I did, you could try a dedicated IP address, which PIA offers as an optional paid add-on. A dedicated IP costs $5 per month, $51 annually or $90 total for three years. But at that point, you may as well consider a slightly more expensive VPN.Key takeaway: PIA’s unreliable internet speed performance means it’s not great for folks with slow internet connections like satellite internet. Its solid server network provides a generous global footprint, including excellent US representation with servers in all 50 states, making it decent for travel. While my daily use was largely acceptable despite some slow-to-load websites or blocky video quality at the start of a stream, the frequent CAPTCHAs when trying to use various apps or sites proved mildly frustrating. Value: PIA is one of the cheapest VPNs available, but a little more money elsewhere gets you significantly faster speedsCost: $12 per month, $40 for the first year (then $50 annually) or $79 total for three yearsMoney-back guarantee: 30 daysPayment options: Credit card/debit card, PayPal, Amazon Pay, cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.)Available apps: Windows (x86 and ARM), MacOS, Linux (CLI and GUI), Android, iOS/iPadOS, Android TV, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, browsers, routersPIA is one of the cheapest VPNs on the market, and while it’s not the fastest or most polished, you get all of the privacy basics plus a few forward-thinking features on a budget. Its wallet-friendly pricing even includes unlimited simultaneous connections, a benefit most pricier VPNs eschew. But a little more money for a rival VPN gets you far faster speeds and a smoother overall experience.Most VPN providers charge anywhere from $10 to $15 for a monthly subscription, and PIA is in the same ballpark at $12. Usually, you’ll save money with an annual or multi-year plan. PIA’s competitive pricing undercuts many rivals at $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 total for three years of service. Granted, we don’t recommend shelling out for more than a year’s worth of service up-front. Your fast, private VPN may suffer slow speeds, a data breach or difficulties unblocking streaming sites during a year. But PIA’s $79 three-year subscription is less than many one-year plans with premium providers, including ExpressVPN, making it an attractive choice, even if I don’t recommend springing for it.If you’re considering PIA, the question is whether the cheaper price is worth the trade-offs. For most people, it might not be. The value-priced Surfshark gives you much faster speeds, better streaming support and more polished apps for about $10 more than PIA for your first year. The only downside is that Surfshark renews at $79 per year, whereas PIA re-ups for $50 on its annual subscription. By contrast, PIA doesn’t make you babysit your subscription as much with its meaningfully cheaper auto-renewal. That said, you can stack subscriptions with Surfshark, meaning if you purchase a one-year plan, and then buy another one-year subscription a few months later, you’ll get an additional 12 months of service added to your account, helping you avoid a pricey auto-renewal. Despite its higher renewal price, I’d still recommend Surfshark for the average user who doesn’t mind taking a more proactive approach to avoiding an automatically renewing subscription.PIA app performance: Highly customizable and largely user-friendly, yet slightly unrefinedPIA’s apps try to balance usability without sacrificing granular control, and while that’s mostly successful, a little refinement could go a long way. Sometimes, it feels like you need to take a Udemy course to understand VPN apps, but many companies like ExpressVPN and NordVPN offer fairly streamlined apps. Private Internet Access falls somewhere in the middle; it’s not as slick and intuitive as ExpressVPN but also not as clunky as PrivadoVPN. Navigating apps largely made sense but was occasionally overwhelmingI found PIA’s VPN apps mostly user-friendly, but even as a VPN expert, I sometimes felt like there was too much going on at once. Finding most major settings was pretty straightforward, and there are some unique privacy features. I was pleased to find split tunneling on MacOS and Linux, not just Windows and Android. Only a handful of VPN providers, including Surfshark, support split tunneling on Apple computers. Split tunneling lets you route some apps through a VPN but not others. I used split tunneling on my MacBook Air M2 to download Bioshock Remastered on Steam without a VPN for faster download speeds while streaming Final Destination 3 on Netflix Germany to stay entertained while I waited for the game to install. In my testing, the kill switch -- which keeps your public IP address private in the event of an unexpected VPN disconnection -- worked flawlessly. But the settings menu felt a bit overwhelming, especially for newcomers. While I liked the control over advanced settings like connection timeout intervals on Wireguard, such options are probably overkill for the average user. While hiding these choices behind an “additional settings” menu might streamline the interface for VPN beginners, that design route could make things less obvious for power users. Juggling user-friendly design without sacrificing power-user capabilities is tricky, and I don’t mind extra settings being visible in this case.But on certain platforms, I found app navigation cumbersome. On Android, diving into the VPN server country list shows everything from lowest ping to greatest. I tried to re-order everything alphabetically and nest cities under countries for easier navigation, but to no avail. Sure, you can search in the search bar, but often, I’ll just scroll down to the country or city I want to connect to. I reached out to customer support and was informed that “...the server list [on Android] is arranged solely based on optimal ping to ensure the best possible connection quality. This setup is designed to enhance your experience by prioritizing servers that offer the most reliable performance.” I get the philosophy -- many folks will want to use a fast VPN server. But that assumes a lot about specific user behavior. Maybe I’m in the US, but want to stream something on Australian Netflix, which would be a higher ping from my location compared with more geographically close servers.Compounding the issue, some country servers have an inconsistent naming convention, so it’s sometimes easier to scroll rather than search. Australian servers are mostly named “AU [city],” for instance, “AU Sydney.” But the streaming-optimized server is “Australia Streaming Optimized.” Searching for “Australia” only pulled up the streaming-optimized server, so I then had to search just for AU, which listed all Australian servers and the lone Austrian server. I’d like the app experience polished more without losing the power user amenities. I don’t expect it to be as slick and streamlined as ExpressVPN, but more logical app design and server sorting on some platforms would go a long way.PIA streaming performance is good, although you may need to hop serversOn a budget, PIA is a great VPN for streaming from Netflix and other sites, but you can find faster VPNs with more international server locations and better unblocking capabilities.Whether you want to stream services from your home country while abroad or unblock foreign streaming libraries to save money on subscriptions, PIA does a decent job thanks to its extensive web of international servers. For folks living in or traveling to the United States, PIA’s servers in all 50 states make it a compelling option, especially for unblocking regional sports TV networks. With apps for all major streaming devices -- Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Android TV -- PIA pairs well with your smart TV.  But rivals, including NordVPN, Proton VPN and Surfshark, offer faster speeds while delivering a more seamless streaming experience. I successfully unblocked US, UK, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Romania, South Africa and Australia Netflix libraries. Using PIA, I watched To Catch a Killer on US Netflix, and Star Trek: The Next Generation on Netflix Canada, normally on Paramount Plus in the States. Curiously, the streaming-optimized servers in some countries, like the UK, didn’t work for me -- some streaming services recognized my connection as VPN traffic. But a quick server change to a non-streaming-optimized server allowed access. My advice: Try a streaming-optimized server first if available, but if not, select a different server.Using US servers, I effortlessly streamed Nosferatu on Peacock, Matlock on Paramount Plus and My Hero Academia on Crunchyroll. Hulu functioned on Windows and MacOS, but it detected VPN usage on Android TV. Tunneling through a Canadian server, I enjoyed The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel on CBC Gem, while a UK server let me watch The Jetty on BBC iPlayer. Max US and international streaming worked nicely, so I enjoyed Heretic on a US server and The Batman on Max Romania. Unfortunately, I had a few issues with Amazon Prime Video US, which worked on MacOS but not Windows or Android TV. Amazon Prime Video UK, on the other hand, played just fine on Windows and MacOS. Customer support: Excellent guides and reasonably responsive tech supportTroubleshooting, like a box of Band-Aids, is something you want to have at an arm’s reach but not need to use. I was impressed with PIA’s extensive guides and relatively fast customer support response times, although live chat answers left a little to be desired.  Private Internet Access boasts a robust support section with a knowledge base, support guides and community forums. The knowledge base features articles on essential topics like learning how a VPN works, testing port forwarding on Linux and managing your subscription. In the guides section, you’ll find tutorials for installing or uninstalling PIA’s VPN apps on different platforms. Live chat is available both for customers and non-customers alike. I initiated a chat and asked how to run a VPN on my smart TV. I heard back after 10 minutes and was told, “the best way is to install it [a VPN] on your router and then connect the TV to the router.” I followed up by asking, “how do I install a VPN on my router?” After about a minute, the customer service agent sent me a YouTube tutorial explaining how to install a VPN on a router. I found the initial reply somewhat helpful, but having instructions for installing a VPN on my router upfront would have been even more beneficial. Additionally, running a VPN on your router is a complex process that varies by individual router, and could void your warranty. I was surprised that the help desk rep didn’t inform me of this and first suggest an easier alternative, like using a Windows PC as a hotspot.In addition to live chat, I submitted a support ticket by filling out a Contact Us form and impressively heard back within an hour. I was pleased with the response time and the detailed answer about re-arranging apps on the PIA Android app. Key takeaway: PIA’s apps are highly customizable, which is great for experts but may be overwhelming for VPN newcomers. Streaming performance was mostly decent despite its high speed loss because of good unblocking capabilities. However, I had to server hop a bit on occasion when various streaming services detected a VPN. Privacy and transparency: PIA prioritizes privacyJurisdiction: USEncryption: AES-256-bit or 128-bit (OpenVPN), ChaCha20 (WireGuard)Open-source appsRAM-only server infrastructureNo DNS leaks detectedIndependently auditedProtocols available: OpenVPN and WireGuardAlthough PIA doesn’t provide the fastest speeds, the slickest app experience or the most cutting-edge privacy features like post-quantum encryption, it offers excellent privacy and transparency. You’ll find both the OpenVPN and WireGuard VPN protocols with modern encryption alongside customization options. For instance, you can select AES-128-bit or AES-256-bit encryption with OpenVPN. Oddly, AES-128-bit encryption comes pre-selected by default. I’d have expected the more secure 256-bit encryption instead, especially since less secure encryption didn’t produce faster speeds in my testing. You’ll also find a slew of privacy basics, including a kill switch. All of PIA’s VPN apps are open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the source code and look for bugs or vulnerabilities (assuming a level of programming knowledge). I appreciate this move, which fosters trust and transparency with users. Only a handful of other VPN companies, including Proton VPN and Mullvad, offer open-source apps. In addition to its privacy basics under the hood, PIA touts one of the most reader-friendly privacy policies I’ve perused and undergoes regular third-party audits to back up its no-log claims.PIA offers RAM-only servers and obfuscated servers, but lacks some of the advanced privacy features of competitorsPIA packs some great options to shore up your privacy, but you won’t find cutting-edge features like post-quantum encryption, a double VPN or Tor over VPN servers that many of our top-rated VPNs offer. The average user should be OK, but folks with serious privacy concerns may consider a different provider, like NordVPN, Proton VPN or ExpressVPN.Many VPN providers utilize RAM-only servers, which don’t save any VPN session data to a hard disk. Because the server stack reboots entirely after each session, there should be no data logged, which therefore beefs up privacy. You’ll also get obfuscated servers that try to mask the fact that you’re using a VPN. If you’re trying to use a VPN on a school Wi-Fi network or with a streaming service but encountering issues, obfuscated servers may help. PIA lets you pick between the SOCKS 5 proxy and Shadosocks for obfuscation, both of which attempt to make your VPN traffic masquerade as traditional web traffic. I like the choices, but you don’t get a dedicated obfuscation-focused VPN protocol like NordVPN’s NordWhisper or Proton VPN’s Stealth, which might be more user-friendly to enable. You get an ad-blocker included with an optional paid antivirus You’ll get an ad-blocker standard with optional paid antivirus software, although the latter falls short to most standalone free and paid services.PIA’s MACE feature -- which comes standard with a VPN plan -- blocks malware, trackers and ads when you’re connected to a VPN server. If you need antivirus protection, PIA offers an optional paid add-on for $4.50 per month, $24 per year or $36 total for three years. PIA’s antivirus solution may be an affordable, convenient VPN and antivirus bundle, but you can get better protection elsewhere. It’s only available for Windows, not MacOS. By comparison, Surfshark’s antivirus software works on Windows, Mac and Android. Unlike PIA’s antivirus, Surfshark’s security solution has been certified by AV-Test -- with more comprehensive coverage and third-party tests, it’s a better choice for a cybersecurity package.PIA undergoes annual third-party audits and publishes quarterly transparency reportsWhen I was in New Orleans and dined at the Clover Grill, there was a sign proclaiming “World’s best hamburgers.” When I asked the server if that assertion was true, he replied, “It’s Bourbon Street. Would anyone lie to you?” VPNs’ no-logging claims feel similar: As important as company claims are, it’s crucial to have regular audits by reputable third parties. PIA underwent a no-logs audit under the scrutiny of Deloitte and published the results in April 2024. A PIA representative confirmed via video call and email that the company has an audit queued up for 2025. I like the annual audit cadence -- while audits don’t paint a complete privacy picture, they’re crucial trust signals. And annual audits maintain that trust with reasonable frequency. Moreover, PIA’s zero-log claims have been successfully vetted in court twice, once in 2016 and later in 2018 -- in both instances, PIA had no logs to hand over. While a no-logs policy means there’s theoretically no user data to share, VPN companies still receive requests like court orders, and transparency reports offer a glimpse into how VPN companies handle log requests. PIA publishes a quarterly transparency report detailing the number of data requests from government agencies, alongside the amount of logs produced. From Oct. 14 to Dec. 31, 2024, PIA received 57 requests, giving over zero logs, suggesting your user data is safe with PIA. Depending on the jurisdiction, a VPN company may be required to share information. Because PIA is headquartered in the US -- a member of the Five, Nine and 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances -- some privacy-concerned folks may be wary. However, its excellent track record of denying data requests should provide peace of mind for most people, especially casual users who want to stream Netflix. PIA’s privacy policy is easy to read with no red flagsPrivate Internet Access takes the “private” part of its name seriously, featuring one of the most digestible privacy policies I’ve pored over. Many privacy policies -- even outside of VPNs -- can read like Dickensian word salads. However, PIA’s privacy policy is as clear-cut as it can be when it comes to legalese. While I’d like the company to take a stronger stance against data-shating across its parent company, Kape Technologies, its excellent transparency coupled with its solid privacy policy largely mitigates any concerns I might otherwise have.Sections have summaries in green, so if you want to know what you’re signing up for without reading every single word, you’ve got a jargon-free way to understand the basics. I like how straightforward PIA’s privacy policy is and how clearly it’s laid out.Private Internet Access is upfront about its commitment to user privacy. Its privacy policy states, “We collect as little personal information as possible – only what’s needed to activate your account and allow you to experience our world-class service. We need two things to sign you up for a subscription: 1) an email address, and 2) payment.” Most VPNs need those basics, with some being more invasive, and Mullvad on its own island, taking privacy effectively as far as possible by not even requiring an account to sign up.In 2019, Kape Technologies -- a company then-infamous for distributing malware -- acquired PIA. Kape owns several other VPNs, including ExpressVPN and CyberGhost. While some folks may be concerned about data-sharing considering PIA’s ownership, PIA maintains a commitment to safeguarding user data, stating in its privacy policy: “While we may disclose collected Personal Data to necessary members in our group of companies (across our ultimate holding company and all its subsidiaries) insofar as is reasonably necessary to continue our Service in line with this Policy, we regard our commitment to user privacy as paramount.” PIA’s disclaimer about data-sharing within its holding company is similarly reassuring to what its sibling company, ExpressVPN, has in its privacy policy. I wasn’t too concerned, especially since PIA outright says in its privacy policy, “We keep minimal personal data. We will NEVER share any of the data we have on our users with anyone, anything, or any entity unless doing so is absolutely necessary for us to keep providing our award-winning service.” Still, ExpressVPN’s privacy policy is even firmer about sharing data with “...related entities…only when required, and for the duration required, for processing solely related to the purposes and legitimate interests outlined in this Privacy Policy, while ensuring at all times the same data protection standards.” I’d like to see PIA address its Kape ownership and data-sharing or lack thereof even more forcefully.PIA is headquartered in the US, which may worry some folks with critical privacy concernsUnlike providers such as Proton VPN or NordVPN, PIA’s jurisdiction falls within the US, which is a member of the Five, Nine and 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances. Addressing its compliance with law enforcement requests, PIA’s privacy policy says, “...although we will comply with all valid subpoena requests, our legal team scrutinizes each and every legal request that we receive for compliance with both the ‘spirit’ and ‘letter’ of the law…PIA will not participate with any law enforcement request that is unconstitutional or illegal. Moreover, when it is possible and a valid option, we will provide the user an opportunity to object to any requested disclosures.”But because PIA doesn’t log user data -- a claim backed up by annual third-party audits -- there should theoretically be little information to pass along besides an email address, payment data and billing address information associated with an account. Additional privacy mitigations, like RAM-only server infrastructure, further safeguard your VPN session data. Its easily decipherable privacy policy reiterates PIA’s commitment to privacy and should assuage all but those with the most serious privacy concerns.Key takeaway: While PIA falls short of many rivals because of its uneven speed loss and highly customizable albeit slightly less refined app design, it hits the privacy and transparency nail on the head. You’ll find one of the most streamlined privacy policies of any VPN on the market, open-source apps, annual audits and a quarterly transparency report. People with demanding privacy concerns, like political activists or asylum-seekers, may be off-put by PIA’s US jurisdiction and Kape Technologies ownership, but for most casual users seeking basic privacy or international streaming capabilities, that shouldn’t be a deterrent. Final thoughts: PIA is a great cheap VPN, but it feels rough around the edgesPIA is a long-time VPN provider that gets a lot right, particularly by providing serious privacy without breaking the bank. But in my 2025 testing, PIA is lagging behind the top of the pack. At $40 for the first year, PIA undercuts most competitors by anywhere from $8 to $60 annually. Even its renewal price of $50 is still cheaper than most rivals. For the price, you get a VPN that’s good for streaming and travel while packing useful privacy basics alongside some rare features, like split tunneling on MacOS. But a little bit more money for another VPN -- notably Surfshark -- can give you a much better experience.PIA’s uneven speed loss makes it a tough sell for folks with slow or unreliable internet connections. And while I liked the customizability of its apps from a power user's perspective, odd design choices, like not being able to view a list of countries alphabetically on Android, are counterintuitive. Additionally, I experienced a lot of CAPTCHAs when trying to use websites and apps, including Google Search and some streaming services. This made everyday tasks, like trying to look something up on Google or stream an episode of a show on Amazon Prime, an occasionally frustrating experience. To be fair, this is a challenge all VPN providers face, but I ran into a lot more roadblocks with PIA than in my 2025 Nord VPN and Proton testing. PIA told me the company has plans to address many of the pain points I encountered, so I’m hopeful those efforts make for faster speeds and fewer internet browsing roadblocks as the year progresses.
