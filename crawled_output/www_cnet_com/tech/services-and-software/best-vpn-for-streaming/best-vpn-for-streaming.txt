Why we like it ExpressVPN is our pick for the best streaming VPN. It's a top-notch VPN provider that demonstrates a steadfast commitment to privacy and transparency. It’s a safe choice for privacy-conscious VPN users, and also a fantastic option for casual users because it’s extremely simple to use, fast and excellent for streaming. Why we like it for streamingDuring our testing, we were able to access geo-restricted content from popular streaming sites like Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Max and Amazon Prime Video through various global server locations. Streaming quality was excellent across all devices we tested on, with no buffering or video quality issues, even when playing 4K videos. You can connect up to 10 devices simultaneously with ExpressVPN, which is on par with NordVPN and Proton VPN but fewer than Surfshark, and should still be enough for most people. If you need to connect more devices -- or stream on smart TVs that don't natively support VPN apps -- ExpressVPN's Aircove VPN router lets you bypass the company's 10 device limit. With ExpressVPN, you’ll get a simple interface and consistent user experience across platforms, making ExpressVPN an ideal choice for beginners. Apps are available for Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV Stick and even a newly released GUI app for Linux. You can make ExpressVPN work with smart TVs or devices that don't offer native VPN apps using the provider's own Aircove router with the VPN built right in. Alternatively, you can use ExpressVPN's intuitive router app on a compatible third-party router for whole-network coverage. You’ll want fast speeds for streaming and other data-heavy activities like gaming and torrenting. ExpressVPN delivers -- we lost only 18% of our base internet speeds in our latest round of speed testing with ExpressVPN.

ExpressVPN is a well-rounded VPN and one of the very best you can buy for streaming or practically any other use case. But the catch is that you’ll pay a premium. The monthly subscription plan costs $13 per month, which is pretty standard across the industry. You’ll pay $75 for the first year or $98 total for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $100 annually). That's about on par with NordVPN, but more expensive than the value-packed Surfshark and Proton VPN. A seven-day free trial is available, followed by a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can test ExpressVPN risk-free to see if it works well for your streaming needs before committing.Also featured in: Best VPN Service for 2024, Best VPN for Apple TV

Why we like it NordVPN is currently the fastest VPN based on our latest speed tests (a mere 3% speed loss), making it an outstanding choice for streaming. All VPNs will slow your internet speeds somewhat, but we registered the lowest speed dips with NordVPN in our testing. Why we like it for streamingWe didn’t suffer any buffering or video quality issues when watching videos, even while streaming 4K content. In our testing, NordVPN effortlessly unblocked foreign Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Max libraries. With NordVPN enabled on Chromecast with Google TV, we were able to unblock Star Trek: The Next Generation on Netflix UK, which is typically reserved for Paramount Plus subscribers in the US. Additionally, we had no issues watching BBC iPlayer, CBC Gem, Hulu, Crunchyroll and several other regional streaming services. The NordVPN app is simple to navigate and packed with features on most platforms. There’s a helpful list of the fastest servers for different countries, such as Canada, the UK, the US, France and Germany, alongside access to all available servers across 126 different countries. You’ll find Onion over VPN, double VPN and obfuscated servers for even more robust privacy protection. You can select a preferred VPN protocol, use split tunneling and auto-connect with NordVPN.

A kill switch is notably absent from some of NordVPN’s streaming client apps, including Android TV, Apple TV and Fire TV. That’s normally a deal-breaker for us, but if privacy is secondary and your main objective is to simply stream movies or TV shows, then you may not mind the omission. Like other top VPNs for streaming, NordVPN features an Apple TV app, but the app's server selection functionality is still a headache to navigate. NordVPN's whole-home VPN router compatibility lets you access foreign Disney Plus, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video libraries on smart TVs or other devices that might not have downloadable VPN apps. With NordVPN, you can connect up to 10 devices at once, which should be enough for most people. The monthly plan is $13 per month, the annual subscription costs $60 for the first year, and the two-year subscription costs $81 total for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $140 annually). NordVPN's starting prices are essentially aligned with what ExpressVPN offers, but you'll pay a premium for its service in comparison to wallet-friendly VPN providers like Surfshark and Proton VPN. All subscription plans are protected by a 30-day money-back guarantee.Also featured in: Best VPN for Fire TV, Best VPN for Netflix

Why we like it If you’re on a budget or you’re a Netflix user seeking to get the most out of your subscription, Surfshark is the way to go. It supports almost every device you can think of, including the Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Android TV streaming boxes. We found that Surfshark is more than capable of streaming content on various streaming services, like Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. However, we did run into a few issues when attempting to stream content on Hulu, including the Fire TV Stick app detecting the VPN.Why we like it for streamingSurfshark really excelled when we tested the provider’s ability to stream Netflix. Surfshark says it can unblock 22 different countries’ Netflix libraries, but it unblocked even more during our testing, including libraries from countries like Denmark, Bulgaria, Belgium and Hungary. Other VPNs can unblock multiple Netflix libraries, but a VPN can rarely do it to the degree that Surfshark can. With Surfshark, we were able to stream The Bear on Disney Plus using a Canadian server (it's on Hulu in the US), The Jetty on BBC iPlayer with a UK server and Law & Order SVU on Netflix with a French server (SVU is on Peacock in the US).We’re impressed with Surfshark’s consistently fast speeds over the past few years, with an average speed loss hovering in the high-teens. We measured an average speed loss of 21% in our 2025 speed tests -- which is technically slower than previous years, but shouldn’t result in a noticeable difference in practice.

As well as being an excellent VPN for streaming, Surfshark packs a ton of useful privacy features into a budget-friendly package. You can boost your privacy by routing your connection through two servers of your choice using Surfshark’s Dynamic Multihop feature or shuffling your IP address using the VPN’s IP Rotator feature. Its GPS spoofer -- only available on Android -- may even let you unblock certain streaming services, like YouTube TV, that rely on GPS for geo-location. Surfshark also offers unlimited simultaneous connections, which goes beyond what most others allow for. Apps are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS and streaming devices, including Apple TV, Fire TV Stick and Android TV dongles or boxes. You can also set Surfshark up on a VPN-compatible router for whole-network coverage and to stream on smart TVs that don't natively support VPN apps.Surfshark's monthly plan costs $15.45 per month, but you can get considerable savings with its longer-term plans. Its yearly plan starts at $48 for the first year, or if you opt for the two-year plan, you'll pay $60 upfront for the initial two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $79 annually). A 30-day money-back guarantee is available with all subscription plans.Also featured in: Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video, Best VPN for Your Smart TV

Why we like it If you want a VPN that’s free and still able to stream the US Netflix library, then Proton VPN is the ideal choice. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET recommends -- it’s secure, safe to use and doesn’t put any limits on speed or usage. Technically, Proton VPN’s free servers across five countries aren’t optimized for streaming, but we still achieved sufficient speeds and were able to smoothly stream Netflix content through the VPN’s free US servers. With Proton VPN's premium tier, you get access to 15,000-plus servers in 122 countries and excellent streaming performance across platforms.
Why we like it for streamingWhile Proton VPN caters primarily to the privacy-focused crowd, it's a well-rounded VPN service that has broad appeal for casual users, thanks in large part to its first-rate streaming capabilities. During our tests, we accessed content from several regional Netflix libraries as well as content on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. Its ability to unblock international Netflix libraries, including the Egyptian Netflix library (which rivals NordVPN and Surfshark struggled to unblock), makes Proton VPN's paid tier a worthy VPN for streaming. The only hiccup we ran into was that we couldn't stream Disney Plus on MacOS through Proton VPN's US servers, although it worked fine on other platforms. We didn't experience any buffering or video quality issues, and streaming content in 4K went smoothly with Proton VPN across all platforms during our tests -- which wasn't surprising considering the VPN cut our speeds by only 16%. Apps are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS, as well as for various streaming devices like AppleTV, Fire TV Stick and Android TV. You can also set Proton VPN up on a router for whole-network coverage and to stream content on smart TVs and other devices like Roku that don't natively support VPN apps. You can connect up to 10 devices at once with Proton VPN, which is the same as what NordVPN allows and more than ExpressVPN. A few other VPNs, including Surfshark and PIA allow for unlimited simultaneous connections, but Proton VPN's allowance of 10 should be enough for most users.
Read more
Proton VPN's free plan is limited to five server locations (US, Japan, Netherlands, Poland and Romania). Proton VPN's paid subscriptions cost $10 per month, $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 a year). A 30-day money-back guarantee is available on all subscription plans in case Proton VPN doesn't fit your streaming needs.Also featured in: Best VPN for Travel, Best Free VPN

Why you should use a VPN for streaming
A virtual private network can be your all-access pass to streaming content from all over the world. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, changing your public IP address, which can make it look like you're in another city, state or even country. Due to regional licensing agreements, streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video, Max, Disney Plus and Hulu have unique content libraries that vary by region. Using a VPN can help you access those region-specific libraries. For instance, if you want to access your home Netflix library while traveling outside of the US, you can connect to a US-based VPN server and access the content as if you were at home. Alternatively, you'll be able to access international content that is not normally available in your region. All you need to do is click or tap on the country location you want to stream content from in the VPN app and you're good to go. Changing your virtual location with a VPN can also help you cut through regional sports broadcast blackouts or even save you money on streaming subscriptions.Choosing the right streaming VPN allows you to keep up with new releases and global streaming video content without being locked into one regional catalog. However, not all VPNs are equally capable when it comes to streaming service unblocking. Many streaming services have systems in place to detect and block VPN usage. We've rigorously tested a bevy of VPN services over the years, putting them through their paces to see how they perform with internet speeds, app usability, connection reliability, privacy and streaming. When evaluating a VPN's streaming capabilities, we test how smoothly the VPN is able to unblock regional streaming content from a wide variety of streaming services through various international server locations across different platforms like mobile, desktop and dedicated streaming devices. Based on that testing, we've designated ExpressVPN as our top pick for the best VPN for streaming, but NordVPN and Surfshark are both worthy alternatives. Whether you want to stream NFL games, watch Wednesday on Netflix or enjoy Alien Earth on Hulu, a VPN for streaming has you covered.

Factors to consider in a VPN for streaming: How to choose the right VPN
Based on our years of experience using and testing VPNs, here's what you should consider when choosing a VPN for streaming.Streaming capabilitiesYour VPN’s capacity to access streaming content is the top factor to consider in a VPN for streaming. If your VPN can’t access geo-restricted streaming content, it isn’t fit for this purpose. It’s also important to make sure that the VPN you choose works well for the specific streaming services you want to access. Think about the streaming services you want to watch like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Hulu, Peacock, Crunchyroll, YouTube TV and Sling -- then try your VPN with those services to see if it works. We've found that ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark all work reliably with each of those streaming services across most platforms.
Keep in mind that a streaming service that works with a specific VPN today may not tomorrow (and vice versa). Sometimes a simple server switch can do the trick and get you access to the content you're looking for. If not, you can alert your VPN's support team to the issue and they may be able to get it resolved. Each of these VPNs will give you your money back within 30 days of purchase, so if it happens to not work as well as you want, you can get a refund. Check out the best VPNs for Netflix and the best VPNs for Amazon Prime Video for more information. SpeedYour VPN’s speed performance plays a major role in the overall quality of your streaming experience. You’ll need a VPN that’s fast, especially if you’re streaming in 4K or if you’re accessing geo-blocked content from a region that’s a considerable distance from your physical location. Generally, you'll need download speeds of 25Mbps at a bare minimum for 4K streaming, but you'll want at least 50Mbps for reliable 4K streaming. You can get by with far less (10 to 20Mbps) for HD streaming. All VPNs will slow your speeds somewhat (sometimes by 50% or more), but if your VPN is slowing your connection too much, you may end up experiencing a lot of buffering or lower-quality video playback. A fast streaming VPN will only reduce your download speeds minimally -- ideally by 25% or less on average. As long as your connection is fast enough to begin with, the speed loss shouldn't be noticeable.PrivacyRegardless of what you’re using your VPN for, privacy is a key consideration for any VPN service. Your VPN should have privacy measures in place, like DNS leak protection, a kill switch, modern encryption protocols and a no-logs policy (ideally one that’s been audited or tested in the wild). A VPN that provides the necessary privacy protections will ensure that your internet traffic is never leaked unencrypted.NetworkA good VPN for streaming should have a network of servers in locations across the globe. If you’re looking to fully optimize your streaming and get access to the largest selection of streaming content, then you’ll probably want to choose a VPN with servers located in the largest number of countries. If you’re looking to access content from a specific region, you should check to ensure the VPN you want to use has servers in the region(s) you need. You can check the VPN’s server page on its website to see what countries it has servers in before purchasing a subscription. Most of our top picks feature thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. To unblock streaming content from a specific country, all you need to do is use the VPN app to connect to a server located in the country from which you want to stream content. For example, to access the US Netflix library, ensure you're connected to a server in the US. Or if you want to access content on BBC iPlayer, connect to a UK server. Device compatibilityYou’ll also want to make sure that the streaming VPN you choose is compatible with the device on which you want to stream content, whether that’s a mobile device, laptop, smart TV or streaming device. Most VPNs are compatible with a wide range of devices, but it’s always a good idea to confirm that the service you’re considering will work with your device. Many VPNs have apps for Fire TV and Android TV that work on streaming devices or smart TVs, but not every provider has an Apple TV app yet. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA and IPVanish are a few of the providers that do have Apple TV apps. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Luckily, you can use a VPN on your router if you want to use a VPN with devices like PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles or Roku streaming devices that don't support native VPN apps.Router installationIt isn't necessary to use a router to stream geo-blocked content with a VPN, but it can help if your smart TV or streaming device doesn't natively support VPN apps. Also, with a VPN router setup, you can protect all of the devices on your network at once while using only one of your allotted simultaneous connections. Installing a VPN on a compatible router can be difficult and even risky if you try it yourself, so be sure you have the technical know-how to do so before proceeding. Alternatively, you can purchase a router with a VPN preinstalled from a company like FlashRouters. If you're an ExpressVPN user, you can purchase the provider's Aircove router or use its intuitive router app on your existing VPN-compatible router. CostVPN prices can vary considerably from one provider to another. A monthly VPN subscription can range anywhere from about $5 to $15 per month. Longer-term VPN subscription plans often feature introductory pricing around $40 to $100 for the first year. But be aware that renewal prices can sometimes double or even quadruple -- with VPN renewal pricing coming in anywhere from $50 to $150 or more per year after introductory term. If you're on a budget, take a look at our list of the best cheap VPNs. You can even use a VPN to save money on your streaming subscriptions because a VPN can help you access more global content without you having to subscribe to as many streaming services. Sports streamingIf you're a sports fan, you can use a VPN to avoid regional blackouts and stream sports from anywhere. To do so, just connect to a VPN server in a location where the sporting event is accessible online -- whether it’s a specific U.S. city, or a different country -- and you should be able to stream all the sports you want. For instance, you can use a VPN to stream out-of-market NFL games or watch NFL matches while traveling abroad. How we test VPNs for streaming
We know choosing a VPN for streaming can be a tall task, so we thoroughly tested different providers using different streaming services on several platforms. For each VPN, we evaluated each provider’s streaming performance on mobile, desktop and dedicated streaming devices like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick and Apple TV. After evaluating how easy it was to navigate each VPN app, we connected to dozens of server locations (including the US, UK, Australia, Japan, Egypt, France, Germany and Canada) with each VPN to determine if the service was able to unblock geo-restricted content from different regions around the world on streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. We noted whenever a VPN was blocked from accessing certain geo-restricted content, and we checked to make sure the VPN connections were fast enough for streaming in 4K and that the streaming experience was smooth and free of buffering when a VPN was able to successfully stream content. Each VPN we’ve listed here is a capable VPN for streaming, but one may work better for you than another, based on your particular needs or budget. Each VPN here also offers a money-back guarantee, so you can try them out before you fully commit to one.

Other VPNs we tested
Private Internet AccessThe wallet-friendly Private Internet Access, or PIA, is an open-source VPN provider with a strong focus on privacy. PIA costs just $12 monthly, $40 for the first year (the one-year plan renews at $50 annually) or $79 every three years. Although PIA worked well enough for Netflix and Disney Plus, it struggled with Amazon Prime Video. PIA has apps for nearly every platform, including Windows, MacOS, Linux (with a GUI that's more beginner-friendly than a command-line interface), web browsers, iOS/iPadOS, Android/Android TV and Apple TV. Despite its affordability compared with many VPN rivals, PIA is tough to recommend for streaming because of its middle-of-the-road speed performance. In our testing, we clocked an underwhelming 49% average speed loss. Folks with fast internet speeds (50 megabits per second or more) should be fine, but slower or more unreliable internet connections like satellite internet might not work as well. (For reference, Netflix recommends a minimum 15Mbps download speed for a single 4K video stream.) Ultimately, PIA is a fantastic VPN with strong privacy features, but its streaming shortcomings limit its appeal for VPN users who want to unblock a wide selection of streaming content. Read our PIA review.IPVanishIPVanish is a decent VPN for streaming if you’re new to VPNs and want a solution that’s simple to use and can help you watch content on various streaming platforms. During our testing, we were able to access Netflix libraries from a handful of regions, along with content on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. Although some VPNs may struggle to deliver across platforms, we were able to access each of the streaming services we tested on each of the devices we tested them on with IPVanish. The main area where IPVanish struggles is its speed. The inconsistency of IPVanish’s speeds -- we clocked a high 44% average speed loss in our 2024 tests -- may put a damper on your streaming experience, especially while watching 4K ultra-high-definition videos.A monthly subscription to IPVanish costs $13 per month, which is on par with many other VPNs, but its annual plan starts off cheaper than both NordVPN and ExpressVPN at $40 for the first year. IPVanish offers a two-year plan that costs $52 total for the first two years combined. Beware that the one-year and two-year plan prices skyrocket to an absurd $156 per year or $312 total every two years after the initial one- or two-year term. Although IPVanish's renewal prices are only slightly more expensive than ExpressVPN's and NordVPN's similarly excessive renewal prices, IPVanish's unremarkable feature set, average overall performance and sluggish speeds make it comparably unattractive and not an ideal choice for streaming enthusiasts. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis).Read our IPVanish review.MullvadMullvad is an excellent choice for privacy-conscious VPN users and posted a reasonable 24% average speed loss in our latest testing. It worked well with Netflix, Disney Plus and Hulu, but it struggled with streaming Amazon Prime Video during our tests and doesn't offer full, native support for smart TVs or streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV Stick or Apple TV. That, in combination with its comparatively small network of servers in just 49 countries, makes Mullvad a tough sell for folks wanting to use the VPN for streaming purposes.Mullvad requires zero personal information to sign up -- not even an email address -- and costs a flat fee of $5 per month whether you use it for a month, a year or five years. You can pay for and add as many months to your account as you want, but Mullvad doesn't have recurring subscriptions of any sort because it strives to collect as little data as possible. If you're not satisfied with the service, then you can request a refund within the first 30 days of purchase.Read our Mullvad review.

Streaming VPN FAQ
Is it legal to use a VPN for streaming?
Unless you’re in a region where VPN use is illegal or restricted, there’s nothing illegal about using a VPN for streaming. It’s a good idea to check the Terms of Service page of the streaming service you’re using to ensure that it doesn’t include language that would render your VPN use in violation of its terms. If you violate a streaming service’s ToS by using a VPN, you may find yourself suspended or even banned from the service. It’s more likely that you’ll just get a pop-up dialogue that says that a VPN/proxy has been detected and the content is not accessible. We haven’t heard of anyone getting in trouble for using a VPN with a streaming service, but it’s up to you to weigh the associated risks.

Which streaming services work with VPNs?
Many streaming services have technology in place to detect and prevent VPN use on their platforms to abide by regional licensing agreements. However, the best streaming VPNs are able to get past those blockades and give users access to geo-restricted content. The VPNs listed above all work with a wide variety of streaming services including Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer and Crunchyroll.

Why isn't my VPN working with Netflix/Disney plus/etc.?
Keep in mind that streaming with a VPN is often a cat-and-mouse game between the VPN and the streaming service, so a streaming service that works today with a specific VPN may not tomorrow, and vice versa. The best VPNs for streaming work hard to give users access to a variety of streaming services, but sometimes there are issues. If your VPN isn't working with a specific streaming service, a simple server switch may do the trick. You can also try streaming the content on another device if you have other devices available. If you're still running into issues, you can contact the VPN's support team and let them know you're having trouble streaming content -- most of the time, they'll do their best to get the issue ironed out on their end.

Can I use a VPN to save money on streaming subscriptions?
It's possible to save money on streaming subscriptions by using a VPN. Because a VPN can help give you access to content not normally available in your region, your streaming options can be substantially expanded. For example, you can access content on a different country's Netflix library that may normally only be available on Peacock in your location -- in which case you'd only have to subscribe to Netflix to access the content you want. This way, you can potentially limit the number of streaming services you subscribe to and save money.
Show more
Do I need a VPN for every streaming device?
You don't necessarily need a VPN for every streaming device you own, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind. If your streaming device natively supports VPN apps and you want to use it to unblock geo-restricted content, then it's a good idea to install a VPN on that device. Some VPNs allow for unlimited simultaneous connections and some limit the number of devices you can connect at once to 10 or less. If your VPN's simultaneous connections allowance is limiting, you can install your VPN on a compatible router to cover all of the devices on your network with a single connection. A router setup can also help you run your VPN on smart TVs and streaming devices like Roku that don't natively support VPN apps. Alternatively, if your VPN offers a SmartDNS option, you can use that directly on your streaming device even if it doesn't support VPN apps. The catch is that SmartDNS doesn't encrypt your traffic and your DNS queries are still visible to your ISP when you use one -- so while SmartDNS can help you unblock geo-restricted content, it doesn't offer the same privacy benefits that your VPN does.
