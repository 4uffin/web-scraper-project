Livestream Barcelona vs. Valencia in Australia
The pick of La Liga's Gameweek 4 fixtures sees Barcelona looking to get back to the team's winning ways as they host Carlos Corberán's Valencia.  Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game as it happens.  The Blaugrana went into the international break after a hugely disappointing 1-1 draw with Rayo Vallecano, with a superb showing from goalkeeper Joan Garcia preventing a far worse result for the defending champs.  The team now faces a Valencia team that came into the weekend's action in 9th position in the standings. Los Che's encouraging 3-0 win over Getafe at Mestalla last time out shows that they're unlikely to experience a thrashing like the 7-1 defeat they suffered in this fixture last season.  Today's game had originally been penciled in as the long-awaited grand reopening of Barca's renovated Camp Nou, but with security licenses still pending, the match will instead take place at the more compact 6,000-capacity Johan Cruyff Stadium.  Barcelona takes on Valencia at the Estadio Johan Cruyff on Sunday, Sept. 14. Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. CET, making it a 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT start in the US, an 8 p.m. BST start in the UK and a 5 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday.
With the opening of the renovated Camp Nou reportedly pushed back until October, Barcelona will face Valencia today at the Johan Cruyff Stadium, the modest home of their B team. Alex Caparros/UEFA/UEFA/Getty Images
How to watch Barcelona vs. Valencia in the US without cableThis match is available to stream in the US via ESPN and ESPN Plus, which has live English and Spanish-language broadcast rights for La Liga in the US.
