How we test
What to consider
Effectiveness
Antivirus software runs virus scans for known viruses and malware, watches for shady websites, offers ransomware protection and monitors unexpected behavior that may be a sign of new viruses and malware. You want antivirus software that can successfully identify these unknown online threats without flagging too many false positives.
Light on system resources
You don't want antivirus software that taxes your PC's resources. If after you install the program, websites open slowly, apps download or open sluggishly or copying a file takes longer than expected, you may want to try another service.
Cost and discounts
Before you buy, check for discounts on a company's website. Another way to save: The prices we list above are for 10 devices -- if the company offered that package -- but you can trim your cost with antivirus packages if you need to cover three or five devices.
Privacy
Companies say they anonymize this technical data as much as possible to protect your privacy. The security companies on our list post privacy policies on their websites, so read their privacy statements to learn what the companies do with the information you share.
Protection for other platforms
Microsoft is by far the biggest target for viruses and malware. Android is second, with just under 1% of apps installed on Android devices with Google Play Protect in the potentially harmful category.

From our phones to our laptops, we use many gadgets and increasingly store vital information on them. Malware can be used to steal this data and lock you out of your devices, derailing your personal and professional life. High-quality antivirus software can prevent this by scanning files you attempt to download and attempting to block anything deemed suspicious or harmful. We’ve extensively researched and tested the most popular antivirus tools -- along with the security suites they come bundled in -- to help you find the right antivirus software for your cybersecurity needs.

What's the best antivirus software overall?Our hands-on antivirus testing showed that Bitdefender is the best antivirus software of 2025. Plans include a myriad of security tools capable of protecting most aspects of your online presence, plus identity monitoring and identity theft insurance for users with advanced assets. You'll also enjoy Bitdefender's user-friendly interface, resource-light yet highly effective performance and comprehensive privacy policies that keep your data safe. However, Bitdefender covers only up to five devices on individual plans.For users with numerous gadgets, McAfee is the best antivirus software, because it offers a variety of cybersecurity and identity protection tools, with coverage for unlimited devices on most plans -- and for lower prices than Bitdefender's five-device plans. However, it'll use more of your device's resources.Best antivirus software of 2025

Originally sold as AVX (AntiVirus eXpert), Bitdefender has protected Windows and MacOS computers since the 1990s. Bitdefender's service expanded to cover iOS and Android in the 2010s, ensuring protection for all of your devices.Why we like itBitdefender's antivirus had excellent usability and performance during my hands-on testing, and it also consistently earns top marks from respected independent antivirus testing labs like AV-Test and AV-Comparatives. The Bitdefender Ultimate Security packages also include a slew of other privacy and security tools, including a VPN, password manager, parental controls, email protection (for local email tools like Outlook), an autopilot tool to help you understand how secure your computer is and webcam protection. I was impressed by the usability and functionality of most of these tools. The digital footprint visualization tool was particularly effective, finding everything from old online accounts to cookies and other trackers connected to sites I've visited, with data going back several years. Bitdefender also provided buttons for requesting data removal from each of these sites, making it easy to clean up my online presence.Additionally, you’ll get two performance-enhancing tools: a One-click Optimizer that aims to help you find ways to speed up your device and a Battery Mode tool for configuring how much power individual device functions use to improve your laptop's battery life. However, it’s worth noting that these tools -- and the firewall protection offered by Bitdefender -- aren’t available for MacOS.Who it's best forBitdefender Ultimate Security is your best choice if you want a suite of tools to protect all of your digital activities, including email and other online activities. The parental controls also make Bitdefender Ultimate Security a great choice if you've got kids or regularly care for kids who might use your devices.Who should look elsewhereBitdefender isn't a great choice for users with numerous devices, as its Ultimate Security packages only provide protection for up to five devices. This is notable when compared to McAfee, which offers protection for unlimited devices, or Norton, which has plans that cover up to 10 devices.Bitdefender's VPN also isn't great, significantly slowing down my internet speed during my testing. Unfortunately, this is a common issue among VPNs built into cybersecurity packages from antivirus companies. If you're looking for a high-quality VPN, we recommend purchasing separate software like ExpressVPN.Finally, it's worth noting that Bitdefender's identity theft protection is only available to US customers. Again, this issue is common among antivirus companies' cybersecurity packages, with international identity theft protection only being available through Malwarebytes. If you're outside of the US, you'll want to seek out a separate tool for identity theft protection.PricingBitdefender Total Security starts at $60 for the first year ($110 per year on renewal) and includes the core antivirus, password manager and VPN with a daily limit of 200MB per device. However, most users will get the greatest benefit from the Bitdefender Ultimate Security plan, which includes unlimited VPN, scam protection tools and dark web monitoring for $90 in the first year and $160 per year after. If you have significant assets to protect, you can further upgrade to Bitdefender Ultimate Security Plus for $120 for the first year ($190 on renewal).If you just want antivirus software, you can get coverage for one device for $30 for the first year ($70 per year on renewal) or try the free version. But since most folks own multiple devices, we recommend Ultimate Security for comprehensive coverage.  ... Show more

Founded in 1987, McAfee has had some difficulties in its journey. It briefly became part of Intel before becoming its own company again, and it even became infamous after releasing a bad update that crippled millions of computers in 2010. But it's always found its way back to providing top-notch antivirus software.Why we like itDuring my hands-on review, I found McAfee's antivirus software very easy to use. Running it in the background had no effect on my everyday activities, and scans used a small enough percentage of resources for me to continue those activities without issues. Moreover, McAfee consistently receives high marks in all three categories measured by AV-Test (security, usability and performance) and has received numerous awards from AV-Comparatives. This proves McAfee's ability to effectively protect your devices from a variety of malware.Along with the core antivirus software, the McAfee Plus Premium package gives you web protection for warding off malicious websites, a password manager and VPN. You'll also get a Social Privacy Manager and Personal Data Cleanup to protect your information online and remove it from untrustworthy sites. I was particularly impressed with the Online Account Manager, which helped me find hundreds of accounts connected to my email address and gave me tools to easily shut them down. I also appreciate that McAfee offers protection for unlimited devices, as opposed to the five- or 10-device limits imposed by other antivirus programs.Who it's best forMcAfee is your best choice if you want effective antivirus protection for more than 10 devices without spending a fortune to get it.Who should look elsewhereMcAfee's scans use up a lot of CPU power -- 50% to 60% -- and the deep scans take much longer than comparable scans I've run using other antivirus programs. This means it may not be the best antivirus for users who regularly perform tasks like video editing and may need to perform these high-resource activities while running scans. I recommend Bitdefender or Norton if you're looking for a resource-light antivirus that still provides excellent protection and comes bundled with a variety of cybersecurity tools.McAfee's VPN also has issues, significantly slowing down my internet during my tests. That said, I encountered similar problems with all the VPNs connected to the antivirus software I've tested, so you'll have to buy a separate VPN if you want both excellent privacy and excellent performance. We recommend ExpressVPN for both its performance and its commitment to privacy.Finally, McAfee's privacy policies give McAfee a lot of leeway in how it shares your information with a wide range of third parties. You may want to consider one of the other companies on this list if you're deeply concerned about privacy.PricingMcAfee Plus Premium costs $45 for the first year and $150 a year on renewal. If you only have one device to protect, you can purchase the Basic plan for $30 in the first year ($90 per year on renewal). However, Basic doesn't include the best McAfee features, like the personal data cleanup tool, so the more expensive plans are worthwhile for most users regardless of the number of devices they own.People with significant assets can spring for the Ultimate antivirus and identity protection plan, priced at $200 for the first year and $280 per year afterward. This plan includes identity theft coverage of up to $2 million and $25,000 ransomware coverage, plus investment monitoring.  ... Show more

Norton is another longstanding name in the antivirus space, protecting millions of devices since 1990.Why we like itI found Norton's antivirus remarkably easy to set up and use during my hands-on testing. This antivirus also had remarkably low resource usage, claiming just 1% to 2% of my CPU's processing power during active scans -- over 20% less than both Bitdefender and McAfee. Moreover, Norton LifeLock has consistently earned high marks from AV-Test and AV-Comparatives for virus and malware detection.Norton's performance optimization tools (software updater, file cleanup and startup manager) were similarly efficient, with quick scans and minimal resource usage. The password manager, safe search extension and safe browser were also effective and easy to use.Norton offers something you won't get with other antivirus tools: encrypted cloud backups. This ensures that your data is safe if your device breaks down. This starts at 2GB, which isn't much but could protect most users' essential data (like your tax information), and goes all the way up to 250GB, which is enough to protect most users' entire data collection.Finally, Norton offers a variety of identity protection features, from dark web monitoring to identity theft protection and credit monitoring. You can also get stolen fund reimbursement of up to $25,000 with the highest-tier plan.Who it's best forNorton LifeLock is your best choice if you're completely new to antivirus tech and want something that emphasizes simplicity. Norton's also a great choice if you're looking for cloud backups and want them bundled into your cybersecurity package to minimize the number of bills you need to manage.Who should look elsewhereNorton lacks the digital footprint and online account management tools offered by other top companies like Bitdefender and McAfee. Similarly, you can't get social media monitoring tools from Norton, so it's not an ideal choice if you want something that will help you clean up your overall online presence.Norton's VPN had better performance than most antivirus companies' VPNs, but it still wasn't great, especially when I set it to servers outside of North America. I recommend buying a separate VPN like ExpressVPN if you want to use a VPN without noticeably slowing down your internet.I was also disappointed by Norton's limited identity theft protection. Specifically, the lack of insurance coverage for identity theft puts Norton's highest-tier package behind comparable packages from Bitdefender and McAfee.Customer service also proved less than ideal, with Norton's AI going to great lengths to keep me from speaking to a human. Moreover, when I did get in touch with a person through phone support, I had to repeat my question multiple times before it was understood.PricingA 10-device subscription for Norton 360 with LifeLock Select is $100 for the first year and $190 per year afterwards.For folks that don’t need Norton’s LifeLock protection, Norton 360 Deluxe offers many of the same antivirus features, along with a VPN and password manager, for $50 a month up front ($120 on renewal) and covers five devices. Or, you can grab the budget-friendly Norton 360 Standard, which covers three devices for $40 in the first year and $95 per year on renewal.  ... Show more

Founded in the Czech Republic, AVG Internet Security has provided antivirus protection to European computers since 1992, with its services expanding into the US in 1998.Why we like itAVG Internet Security had similar scan speed and resource usage to Norton during my hands-on testing, making it one of the most efficient antivirus tools I tested. AVG's antivirus also has consistently high AV-Test rankings across all categories.Most of AVG's other tools were also highly effective, from the TuneUp program (which helps you clean up your files and processes to improve device performance) to the AntiTrack tool (which opts you out of the biggest ad-tracking programs and blocks additional tracking on websites you visit). The secure browser and safety extension for popular browsers like Chrome can further protect you while surfing the web, though neither one is particularly good at blocking ads.Who it's best forAVG Internet Security can be a good choice if you're looking for a free or highly affordable cybersecurity package that includes both an antivirus and safe browsing tools.Who should look elsewhereAVG Internet Security doesn't include features like dark web monitoring, online account management or digital footprint visualization, making it a poor choice if you're looking to control where and how your data is used online. AVG doesn't offer identity theft protection or insurance either, so you'll want to look to one of the other companies on this list if you have assets to protect.I also had issues with AVG's VPN, which had poor performance, even when compared to other antivirus companies' VPNs. If you're looking for a high-quality VPN, consider purchasing a separate program like ExpressVPN.AVG's customer service further disappointed me, forcing me to jump through multiple hoops before I could speak with a person. It also took an unusually long time for AVG's support representatives to answer my questions. I recommend Bitdefender or McAfee if you're looking for an antivirus with good customer support.Finally, AVG's privacy policies and its connection to Avast -- a company fined $16.5 million by the FTC for selling its customers' data -- give me some concerns about AVG's commitment to protecting user data. If you're concerned about the security of your personal information, I recommend choosing a different antivirus company like Bitdefender or even Malwarebytes, which has the best privacy policy of any antivirus I've tested.PricingYou can get AVG Internet Security for 10 devices for $60 in the first year and $100 a year on renewal. The single-device plan is more affordable at $40 for the first year and $78 per year after.  ... Show more

Founded in 2004, Malwarebytes started as a tool for removing malware from computers. It has since grown into a full antivirus service with real-time protection and other benefits.Why we like itIf you're looking for an antivirus company that truly commits to protecting its users' data, look no further than Malwarebytes. Malwarebytes' VPN is a true no-logs VPN with RAM-only, diskless servers that don't store any user data in a permanent way. Malwarebytes' other programs collect slightly more data, but it's limited to what Malwarebytes needs to continuously run and update its software to protect against new threats. Moreover, Malwarebytes has strict limitations on the third parties it will share your data with. While this does include public authorities, Malwarebytes is adamant that it will only do this if compelled, and it won't share your data with the same range of marketing and advertising companies that other antivirus companies share information with.The software itself is also highly efficient, using even less disk CPU power than other low-resource antivirus tools like AVG and completing regular scans within five minutes during my hands-on testing. The deep scans took longer -- around 40 minutes -- but not nearly as long as McAfee's full scans. Other Malwarebytes tools were similarly effective, with dark web scanning bringing up dozens of breaches going back years. Malwarebytes' VPN also had significantly less impact on my internet speed than most other VPNs created by antivirus companies, though it still didn't perform as well as something like ExpressVPN.Who it's best forMalwarebytes is your best choice if you want to get antivirus protection without compromising your privacy.Who should look elsewhereMalwarebytes' interface isn't particularly easy to navigate, with scan scheduling hidden away and no built-in deep scan feature (you have to set up your own deep scans with the custom scan option). This makes it a poor choice for folks who aren't technically inclined.Furthermore, Malwarebytes' third-party test results are mixed. It hasn't performed well in its most recent AV-Test and AV-Comparatives tests, but it did receive a 2025 Product of the Year Award from AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation. The AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation is a reputable organization with membership in the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization, but you may still want to consider another program if you're not fully confident in the AVLab Cybersecurity Foundation's results.Finally, Malwarebytes' customer service is remarkably frustrating. The knowledge base -- the one aspect of customer service tech companies almost universally get right -- lacks multimedia content on most pages, the live chat representatives can be slow to answer even simple questions, email support is slow, and phone support doesn't exist. Consider Bitdefender or McAfee if good customer support is important to you.PricingYou can get protection and disinfection for one device for $45 per year. For access to the full security suite, you'll pay $120 in the first year and $240 per year on renewal, with coverage for one device. Additional fees are charged for each additional device attached to your Malwarebytes plan.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing antivirus software
Picking the best antivirus software means finding one that keeps your PC or mobile device safe, doesn't consume a lot of system resources, is easy to use and stays out of the way until you need it. Here's what to look for.EffectivenessAntivirus software runs scans for known malware and can offer real-time protection. It can watch for shady websites and suspicious links to keep you out of trouble. It can also offer ransomware protection and monitor unexpected behavior that may be a sign of new and not-yet-identified viruses and malware. You want antivirus software that can successfully identify these unknown online threats without flagging too many false positives.You can determine an antivirus software’s effectiveness by checking out its detection rate in tests performed by labs like AV-Test and AV-Comparatives. Look for software with high security rankings and an online detection rate of at least 90%.Light on system resourcesYou don't want antivirus software that taxes your PC's resources, like CPU power. The antivirus shouldn't slow your computer down at all while running in the background or have a significant impact on your ability to perform everyday tasks when running active scans.Scans also shouldn't take a long time (more than 10 minutes for a regular scan or one hour for a deep or full scan). Similarly, additional tools should have minimal impact on the performance of your device or the specific program (like a browser) those tools are connected to.While we do consider performance in all of our antivirus reviews, a program's impact on your device may be different. The good news is that most antivirus programs offer either a free trial or a money-back guarantee, so you can test out how they work on your setup with minimal risk.Cost and discountsDon't just pay the sticker price for antivirus protection. Before you buy, check for discounts on a company's website. You can also trim your cost with smaller antivirus packages if you need to cover three or five devices rather than, say, 10. You may also find discounts on an app's Amazon page or at outlets like Best Buy.Pay close attention to renewal costs. Most antivirus tools charge annual fees and only offer discounts for the first year, though you may be able to get a discount by paying for two years upfront. These promotional prices might lead to you paying as much as double the original amount for the following years.Bundled servicesAntivirus software may come bundled with other security tools like a password manager and a VPN. Buying a security suite with all of these tools lets you manage everything from one account, saving you hassle and money.However, the VPNs in these security bundles aren’t always the best tools available. You may want to purchase separate subscriptions or choose a VPN with antivirus if privacy is a major concern.PrivacyTo be effective, antivirus software needs to monitor what's going on with your PC, check in with company servers about unusual behavior and provide sound banking protection. It's important to protect yourself by making sure the company you work with has protocols for pseudonymizing or anonymizing data so it's not connected to your identity and encrypting all information -- especially anything that can't be disconnected from your identity.You'll also want to consider the number and types of disclosures the company's privacy policy allows, which dictate what third parties it may give your information to.Protection for other platformsMany of us have our important data spread across multiple devices with different operating systems. This makes it important to choose an antivirus that can protect all of these devices. Pay close attention to any features that are limited to a specific operating system.Customer serviceThe best antivirus companies offer 24/7 customer service via live chat, phone and support ticket, with fast and helpful representatives. We test all of these methods of communication during our reviews to help you get a sense of the company's overall commitment to customer support.Issues with AvastIn test after test, Avast Antivirus for Windows performed well for malware detection, with options ranging from Avast free antivirus software to Avast Premium Security. We've included its antivirus in our list of recommended security app options before.However, early in 2024, the Federal Trade Commission fined Avast $16.5 million to settle charges that claimed the company had sold customer browsing information to more than 100 third parties from 2014 to 2020. Avast allegedly collected the data through browser extensions and antivirus software and sold the data through its Jumpshot subsidiary, the FTC claims. As part of the settlement, Avast is prohibited from selling or licensing any web browsing data for advertising purposes.In response to the initial reports in 2020, then-Avast CEO Ondřej Vlček said in a statement that he understood his company's actions raised questions of trust. To address that, Avast terminated Jumpshot data collection in January 2020 and closed its operations. We hope the FTC actions mean that there will be no further Jumpshot-style activities and that Avast returns to glory as one of the best antivirus software options. Until then, we recommend using one of the many other solid choices in this realm (listed above). Issues with KasperskyLet's talk about Kaspersky Lab, specifically about the June 2024 federal ban prohibiting Kaspersky from directly or indirectly selling antivirus or cybersecurity software or services in the US or to US citizens. This sweeping ban follows a more limited one in 2017 that prohibited Kaspersky software and services on federal government computers because of alleged ties between Kaspersky and the Russian government.Based in Moscow, Kaspersky Lab has for years produced some of the highest-rated antivirus software for business antivirus needs and home customers. Its software consistently earned top scores and awards for virus and malware detection and endpoint protection from independent testing labs.“Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive US information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard US national security and the American people," Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in the official announcement of the ban.In a statement, Kaspersky said it "does not engage in activities which threaten US national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted US interests and allies." How we test antivirus software
Our research process starts with looking at each antivirus company's website to evaluate its features, additional security tools (like VPNs) and pricing to determine its overall value. We also consider the operating systems and number of devices each antivirus tool can protect, prioritizing tools that can protect all of your computers and mobile devices.If our initial research shows that a company provides a broad range of high-value security tools, or an affordable antivirus with robust features, we move on to hands-on testing. This involves purchasing a plan, installing all of the suite's security tools, and testing each tool for performance (the percentage of resources used and speed of scans) and usability (ease of use).Finally, we analyze the company's commitment to its customers. This begins with thoroughly reviewing the company's privacy policies to determine what user data it keeps, how it protects that data and what types/how many third parties it shares that data with, giving higher rankings to companies that minimize data collection and sharing. We then move on to testing the customer service by reaching out via live chat, phone and email (when available), using the experience to evaluate the speed and helpfulness of each company's customer support team. Other antivirus software we've tested
In addition to the antivirus apps we recommend, a handful of other antimalware tools are worth considering among the best antivirus protection if you find them at a better price or just prefer to use one over our picks above.AviraAvira's antivirus technology consistently receives excellent AV-Test results and AV-Comparatives awards. I was also impressed by the antivirus's fast, efficient scans during my hands-on testing. I especially appreciate that you can get this antivirus, along with Avira's safe browsing tools, for free.Unfortunately, Avira is also frustrating to set up. Plus, the company also has business practices -- like installing a secondary performance optimization program without permission or prompting -- and privacy policies that leave me very concerned about how much information it collects and what it does with this data. This includes a policy of tracking IP addresses of VPN users, which opens the door to reverse-engineering other VPN usage data the company claims it doesn't track, and a willingness to share that information with public authorities.Moreover, Avira has some of the worst customer service I've experienced when testing antivirus software. Live chat was great, but phone service was unhelpful, and I didn't even receive a response from email support. Combined with the privacy policy issues, this makes it difficult to recommend Avira. All of this makes Avira's premium plan a poor choice -- but Avira can still be worth considering if you're looking for free antivirus software.Trend Micro Maximum SecurityThis antivirus provider may not be as well known to consumers because of its focus on enterprise security, but Trend Micro antivirus security also brings its business expertise to the home with its Trend Micro Maximum Security tools.Trend Micro's software earns high marks from AV-Test, consistently scoring well for detecting zero-day attacks and widespread viruses and malware. Trend Micro also does a good job of not taxing system resources. Trend Micro's antivirus for home users starts at $20 for the first year ($40 per year after).ESET NOD32 AntivirusIf you're looking for something easy to set up and use, ESET NOD32 antivirus may meet your needs. It earns high scores for usability and offers solid virus protection. A five-device option is available for as little as $60 for a year on the base package, with a five-device, one-year plan on its midrange Essential tier running $70. ESET NOD32 has a 30-day free trial so you can try before you buy. Best antivirus FAQ
Which software is best for antivirus?
The best antivirus software is Bitdefender. Our hands-on testing found that Bitdefender has a wide range of features, a user-friendly interface and excellent performance.
Show more
Which antivirus program is 100% effective?
Both Norton and McAfee have achieved 100% malware detection during third-party testing from AV-Test. However, new malware is created every day, and lab conditions can’t perfectly replicate real-world conditions, so the same results are unlikely in real life. Following basic internet safety best practices is essential regardless of the antivirus software you’re using.
Show more
Which is better, Norton or McAfee?
Norton is better if you’re looking for a total security suite. The Norton 360 subscription includes high-quality antivirus software, a password manager and VPN, safe browsing tools, parental controls and 50GB of cloud storage. You can also get some identity theft protection features and 250GB of cloud storage if you get the most expensive Norton plan. Plus, Norton had better user-friendliness and performance in our hands-on testing.However, McAfee can be more useful for users with significant assets, as it provides up to $2 million in identity theft insurance. McAfee's plans also cover unlimited devices, which makes it a good choice if you have more than 10 devices to protect.
Show more
Is Windows Defender better than Norton?
Microsoft Defender -- formerly Windows Defender -- provides good security for most users, but it only had a 98.8% malware detection rate in the most recent tests conducted by AV-Test. Norton had a 100% malware detection rate in its most recent tests, proving that Norton is better than Windows Defender.
Show more
Can antivirus protect against phishing?
To a degree, yes. Some antivirus programs can do things like warn you or block you from visiting a suspected phishing site. Others may automatically block suspicious emails that appear to come from a malicious sender or contain phrasing common in phishing emails. However, you cannot count on an antivirus program to be a failsafe solution for phishing protection. You still need to be vigilant and know what to look out for on your own when it comes to phishing because an antivirus program won't be able to catch everything.
Show more
Will antivirus slow down my computer?
Any program running on your computer will require a certain amount of processing power to work, which can affect your computer's overall performance. If an antivirus program is just running in the background, it shouldn't affect your computer's performance. When actively running a scan of your system, antivirus software can noticeably slow down your computer. If this is the case, try scheduling antivirus scans at night, or at a time when you're not using your computer.
Show more
Does my Mac need antivirus?
There is a common misconception that Macs are inherently immune to malware, but the truth is that most malware simply wasn’t created to target Macs due to their limited market share. As Macs continue growing in popularity, they're increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals looking to deploy malware designed for the MacOS operating system. MacOS has a built-in antivirus solution called XProtect that can detect and remove malware. It works in the background and updates automatically to keep up with the latest threats, but it still may not catch everything that a third-party antivirus program will. So if you want to play it safe and boost the malware protection on your Mac, it's a good idea to add a third-party antivirus solution.
