The Girlfriend, a psychological thriller series starring Olivia Cooke, is now streaming on Prime Video. Prime Video
Have you run out of TV series to tackle on Prime Video? Chances are, you're leaving some great options unwatched.You might know Amazon's streaming service best for shows like The Boys and Fallout -- and both are great -- but you shouldn't stop there if you have a subscription. The streamer is home to lesser-known series like The Devil's Hour and continues to add excellent options, such as the new college-set comedy Overcompensating.Note that Prime Video is ad-supported and charges an extra fee to remove commercials. Read on for this month's new releases and a collection of the best shows on the streamer.Watch Prime Video
See at Amazon
What's new on Prime Video in SeptemberNote: These descriptions are taken from Prime Video press releases and lightly edited for style.Sept. 1The Runarounds, season 1 premiere (2025- ): Teen drama.

Brooke Palmer/Prime Video
Gen V (2023- )
Gen V is a spin-off of Prime Video's hit violent and satirical series The Boys. Despite efforts to keep her head down, freshman Marie Moreau gets swept up in a mystery at Godolkin University, a prestigious but shadowy school for superheroes. The new series' strong characters and fresh story establish it as something pretty super in its own right. Another reason to watch? Season 4 of The Boys picks up after the events of the first Gen V season.
Amazon Studios
Invincible (2021- )
For those who aren't a fan of cartoons, Invincible could be your converter, up there with other adult cartoons like BoJack Horseman and Rick and Morty. Based on a comic book from Robert Kirkman, the creator of the Walking Dead, Invincible follows 17-year-old Mark Grayson and his training to become a superhero just like his father, who happens to be the most powerful superhero on the planet. Episodes run long at nearly 50 minutes, connected into one big, blood-spattered story. A subversive series with a huge cast featuring Steven Yeun, Sandra Oh and J.K. Simmons, Invincible will engross you in its smart animated world.
Amazon Studios
The Boys (2019- )
The Boys stormed Amazon with its ultra-violent tale of antihero vigilantes seeking revenge against the world's most beloved superheroes. These heroes aren't what they seem: Their corporate overlords cover up their shady personal lives, including sexual harassment and the odd assassination. With social commentary, black comedy and pops of gore, The Boys takes a thrilling and unapologetic step away from the family-friendly genre.
Crime
Tyler Golden/Prime
Ballard (2025- )
If you enjoyed Bosch and Bosch: Legacy, and you'd watch a spinoff or just want a thrilling new police drama to consume, Prime Video's Ballad should be at the top of your list. The series stars Maggie Q as the leader of the Los Angeles Police Department's underfunded cold-case division. The team deals with long-forgotten crimes, uncovering shocking information about the LAPD in the process.
Shane Mahood/Amazon Studios
Reacher (2022- )
Adapted from Lee Child's best-selling Jack Reacher book series, Reacher's eight-episode first season packs a muscular punch. Reacher, a brawny former US Army military policeman played by Alan Ritchson, arrives in a small town and is promptly arrested for a murder he didn't commit. Armed with killer strength and some solid detective skills, the protagonist eventually fends off an array of enemies while uncovering a criminal conspiracy. A treat for crime thriller fans and lovers of Child's novels.
Romance
David Lee/Prime Video
Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2024- )
Prime Video's Mr. & Ms. Smith cast Donald Glover and Maya Erskine in a story about strangers turned married spies. The eight-episode series reimagines the 2005 action film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, following the unconventional spy couple as they encounter risky missions and, inevitably, a change in their feelings for each other.
Dana Hawley/Prime Video
The Summer I Turned Pretty (2022- )
If a coming-of-age tale with a peak summer setting, a teenage love triangle and a soundtrack stocked with Taylor Swift songs sounds appealing to you, keep reading. The show centers on Belly (breakout actor Lola Tung), who makes a much-anticipated annual commute to a beach house with her mom and brother. She looks a bit different than she did the last time she set foot on Cousins Beach and spent time with her mom's best friend's sons, Conrad and Jeremiah. Young-adult author Jenny Han wrote the book on which the TV series is based and serves as one of the showrunners.
Prime Video
With Love (2021-2023)
Looking for love? With Love might be the perfect feel-good rom-com. The charming premise sees the Diaz siblings, Lily and Jorge, navigate major holidays across the year, from Halloween to Christmas -- major holidays that put pressure on singletons in search of romantic relationships. Follow the Diazes on their journey, along with their delightful and sometimes delightfully awkward extended family. An earnest, enjoyable breeze.
Comedy
Prime Video
Overcompensating (2025- )
If the news of Max's Sex Lives of College Girls getting canceled left you aching for a new collegiate comedy to obsess over, don't skip Overcompensating. The series' first episode follows university freshmen Benny and Carmen, who feel the pressure to do the deed on night one, lest their social statuses plummet. However, former high school football star Benny is attracted to guys and closeted. Authentic and funny, this series from comedian Benito Skinner is one of Prime's best new shows.
Prime Video
The Outlaws (2021- )
Seven strangers are assigned to the same community payback sentence in this appealing comedy thriller set in Bristol, England. The six-episode show is fun, dark and touching, offering an engaging look at its rule-breakers backgrounds and the relationships that form between them. The plot thickens when some members of the group come across a bag of cash. If you need another draw, the show is co-created by Stephen Merchant, who co-created the UK version of The Office.
Amazon Studios
Undone (2019-2022)
This unique series uses the Rotoscoping animation technique to tell the story of a young woman who, after suffering a near-fatal car accident, discovers she can manipulate time. Intriguing, right? It gets better: Bob Odenkirk plays Alma's dead father, who enlists her help in investigating his murder. Bending both time and space, Undone is surreal and beautifully existential for those looking for deep material.
Jackie Brown/Amazon Studios
The Kids in the Hall (2022)
Prime Video has resurrected The Kids in the Hall, the Emmy-nominated Canadian sketch comedy show that originally ran from 1988 to 1995. (By "resurrects," I mean the show literally exhumes members of the comedy troupe from a grave they were buried in at the end of the original show. That's just the beginning of the fun.)  Follow the comedians as they freak out over mislabeled desserts, fight over imaginary love interests and write Earth's last fax. Be warned: Some of these sketches are highly NSFW.
Amazon Studios
A League of Their Own (2022)
Prime Video's TV series A League of Their Own is inspired by the 1992 film of the same name and introduces new characters portrayed by Abbi Jacobson, D'Arcy Carden and others. In the comedy-drama's first episode, women try out for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the '40s. The show explores themes of race and sexuality and offers a satisfying period setting and compelling characters.
Amazon Studios
The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (2017-2023)
A '50s housewife who becomes a standup comic? This brilliant series from Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino is filled with sparkling performances from Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Borstein, with dialogue to match. Set in a vibrant and changing New York, our delightful heroine moonlights as a comedian, while doing her duties as an upper-class Jewish American housewife. With impressive visuals, warmth and zingers, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is the full package.
Thriller
Prime Video
The Devil's Hour (2022- )
The Devil's Hour sets up an intriguing mystery: Why is a woman, Lucy, waking up at 3:33 a.m. each night, and why does her 8-year-old son, Isaac, seem oddly emotionless? Starring Jessica Raine (Call the Midwife) as Lucy, Nikesh Patel (Starstruck) as a kind detective and Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who) as a suspicious character, the Devil's Hour is a twisty series that eventually delivers satisfying answers. A bonus? A third and final season is on the way.
Niko Tavernise/Prime Video
Dead Ringers (2023)
Oscar winner Rachel Weisz plays not one, but two main characters in Dead Ringers, Prime Video's version of David Cronenberg's 1988 psychological thriller. The darkly comedic series follows identical twin doctors pursuing their goal of opening a birthing and research center. Spend some time with these unconventional sisters, you'll want to see the whole thing through.
York Tillyer/Amazon Studios
Chloe (2022)
Led by a stellar Erin Doherty, this British thriller will swallow your attention. It centers on Becky, a temp with an unusual pastime: assuming different identities to sneak into fancy art galleries and yoga classes. When a woman she follows obsessively on Instagram suddenly dies, she attempts to uncover more details, once again posing as someone else. Tear away from your timeline and check out this six-episode limited series.
Sci-fi
Prime Video
Fallout (2024- )
Prime Video's video game adaptation is an entertaining postapocalyptic adventure you shouldn't leave sitting in a vault. The series follows three characters occupying the same wasteland. One is Lucy (Ella Purnell), who wanders in search of her kidnapped father and feels the need to invoke the Golden Rule to a cruel post-human Ghoul (Walton Goggins). Meanwhile, an eager Maximus (Aaron Moten) gets his big break as a squire in the Brotherhood of Steel. It's an unpredictable series with humor and gore. Don't let long episode runtimes deter you from exploring Fallout.
Prime Video
The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy (2024- )
A wacky, stellar adult animated comedy about exceptional alien surgeons, the Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy follows best friends Dr. Sleech and Dr. Klak (voiced by Stephanie Hsu and Keke Palmer) as they perform daily duties like treating a patient using an anxiety-eating parasite (that's just episode 1). The series' out-of-this-world voice cast also features Maya Rudolph, Natasha Lyonne and all five Culkin brothers.
Prime Video
Paper Girls (2022)
The first episode of Paper Girls, a sci-fi TV series based on popular comics by Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang, brings together four kids riding bikes on their paper delivery routes in 1988. While that may sound like a sci-fi-er you've binged already, (yep, Netflix's hit Stranger Things), Prime Video's show stands on its own. Follow along as the girls travel through time, navigate powerful adversaries and learn more about themselves. Another reason to watch? Comedian Ali Wong is also part of the cast.
Drama
Prime Video
Expats (2024)
A new miniseries starring Nicole Kidman may be enough to guide your finger to the Play button, but you may also want to know that Expats comes from Lulu Wang, the director of the critically acclaimed 2019 comedy-drama The Farewell. In the six-episode show, Kidman portrays an American woman who's living in Hong Kong and is one of three characters linked by a sudden family tragedy.
David Hindley/Prime Video
Riches (2022)
A soapy drama about a family after the death of their wealthy patriarch sits tantalizingly on Prime Video. In Riches, the will reading goes in an unexpected direction, leading Stephen Richard's two sets of children to vie for control of his business. You'll glide through the stylish first season, which includes Ted Lasso Emmy nominee Sarah Niles.
Amazon Studios
The English (2022)
Gripping Western drama series The English stars Emily Blunt and Chaske Spencer as an unlikely duo traveling across a treacherous landscape. The first episode of the miniseries presents some terrible characters and reveals a bit of what motivates both protagonists -- Blunt's aristocratic Englishwoman and Spencer's Pawnee ex-cavalry scout -- to continue in the face of danger. Gorgeous visuals and superb acting make The English worth a binge.
Alan Peebles/Prime Video
A Very British Scandal (2022)
Unfurling over three hour-long episodes, A Very British Scandal dramatizes the highly publicized, real-life divorce between the Duke and Duchess of Argyll in the 1960s. Claire Foy, of Netflix's The Crown, and WandaVision's Paul Bettany star.
Ali Goldstein/Amazon Studios
As We See It (2022)
A newer entry to Prime Video, As We See It earns a spot among its best shows. Starring three actors who identify as autistic, this sincere series follows young adults on the autism spectrum as they navigate jobs, make friends and find love. Neurotypical actors usually play autistic characters on screen, so the casting sets this one apart. It's also heartfelt, funny and poignant, with well-rounded characters you'll want to root for. I could let the show's glowing Metacritic score speak for itself -- but whatever convinces you, this needs to be your next watch.
Fantasy
Jonathan Prime/Prime Video
My Lady Jane (2024)
Lady Jane Grey, the Queen of England for just nine days in 1553, is the subject of this Prime Video series. The show doesn't stick closely to the events of her life, weaving in fantasy elements like humans who can turn into animals and imagining a world where she met a fate other than execution. Based on a book of the same name and blending comedy, action, romance and more, My Lady Jane is a wild, enjoyable ride you won't find in a history book.
Prime Video
I'm a Virgo (2023- )
Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You) created this surreal series about Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a 13-foot-tall Black man who leaves home for the first time at 19. The gentle giant from Oakland, California, experiences friendship, love and more milestones in this coming-of-age story, which brings humor, social commentary and undeniable originality to the small screen.
Ben Rothstein/Prime Video
The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (2022- )
Haven't watched Prime Video's buzzy, wildly expensive fantasy series yet? The Rings of Power brings incredible visuals, a sprawling cast and a sense of adventure to the streaming service. It's set thousands of years before The Lord of the Rings, and in part follows a young version of the character Galadriel, who's played by Morfydd Clark.
Amazon Studios
The Legend of Vox Machina (2022- )
Buckle up for a new animated series that centers on a group of boisterous, belching misfits called Vox Machina. Based on Dungeons & Dragons web series Critical Role (you don't have to be familiar with that to enjoy this show), The Legend of Vox Machina sees its protagonists go from being broke bar-hoppers to accepting a mission to stop evil brewing in Exandria. We're further introduced to the characters in a musical number that occurs about halfway through the first episode. That's right, I said musical number. You'll be down for every element this show throws at you. Why would anyone choose these misfits to fight for the kingdom? "Well ... they do have a bear," one royal decision-maker concedes.
Documentary
Prime Video
LuLaRich (2021)
In LulaRich, the directors of Hulu's Fyre Festival documentary explore the dark side of the multilevel marketing company LuLaRoe. The four-part documentary series interviews founders DeAnne and Mark Stidham and paints a not-so-rosy picture of the women's clothing giant, which is known for its loudly colored and patterned leggings and tops. In the doc, women who joined the company (investing a chunk of money in the process) dealt with stinky merchandise, a toxic culture and challenges in reaching financial goals. Settle in for a fascinating and well-made docuseries that spotlights the stories of former LuLaRoe retailers.
