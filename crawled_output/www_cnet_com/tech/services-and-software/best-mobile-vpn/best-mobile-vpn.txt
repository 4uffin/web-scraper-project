How we test
We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability.
Factors to consider in a mobile VPN
Device support
For a mobile VPN, think about the devices you want to install a VPN on -- like your Android phone, Android tablet, iPhone or iPad. Additionally, consider the other platforms like Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android TV, Apple TV, Fire TV, routers or browsers that you want to use a VPN with. Consider how many simultaneous devices you need to run a VPN on.
Internet speed loss
All VPNs slow down your internet connection somewhat because they encrypt your data by sending it through secure servers first. Look for a maximum average 25% internet download speed loss. The fastest VPNs we tested only drop your internet speeds by an average of 11% or so.
Privacy
At a minimum, select a VPN with a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a strict no-logging policy backed up by third-party audits. We also suggest a VPN provider that publishes regular transparency reports. For encryption, look for AES-256-bit over the OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols and ChaCha20 with WireGuard.
Server network
Consider the overall number of servers as well as individual country locations. On the high end, many comprehensive server networks consist of thousands of servers spread across 100 or more different countries.
Streaming capabilities
VPNs can be helpful for unblocking geographically restricted entertainment content. You can use a VPN to watch streaming services like Peacock, Max or Hulu from your home country while traveling abroad. VPNs can also unlock access to foreign Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video libraries.
Cost
Most VPNs let you can sign up for a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year VPN subscription. Expect to pay $5 to $15 a month, $40 to $100 per year or $80-plus for a two or more year plan. A multi-year deal often nets you the greatest savings, but we recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with lower risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a data breach or stop allowing access to foreign Netflix libraries over a year.

Why we like it ExpressVPN is a top-notch VPN provider that demonstrates a steadfast commitment to privacy and transparency. It’s a safe choice for privacy-conscious VPN users and for casual users since it’s extremely simple to use, fast and excellent for streaming. In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that it offered servers in all 50 US states, making it a good choice for folks traveling to and within the United States, or for those who are seeking a VPN to unblock regional sports, like NFL and WNBA games.Why we like itWith ExpressVPN, you’ll get a simple interface and consistent user experience across platforms, making ExpressVPN an ideal choice for beginners. Apps are available for Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV Stick and even a newly released GUI app for Linux. ExpressVPN’s streaming performance is impressive. We were able to access content from popular streaming sites like Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Max and Amazon Prime Video across all devices we tested. You can connect up to eight devices simultaneously with ExpressVPN, which is fewer than many other VPNs offer (NordVPN allows for 10 and Surfshark unlimited), but should still be enough for most users.You’ll want fast speeds for streaming and other data-heavy activities like gaming and torrenting. Thankfully, ExpressVPN delivers. We measured an 18% average speed loss in our latest speed tests with ExpressVPN, which represented a significant improvement over our previous testing. The provider was able to remedy some recent speed woes with a couple of inventive solutions on both Lightway and OpenVPN protocols on its latest Windows app.

If you have heightened privacy needs, you’ll appreciate ExpressVPN’s approach to transparency and user privacy. The provider leads the industry with 22 independent audits since 2018 and sets a standard by consistently rolling out innovative privacy improvements. ExpressVPN has kept pace with post-quantum security standards and integrated ML-KEM into the Lightway protocol to beef up its post-quantum protections. IP Shuffle is another helpful feature that works in the background and changes your IP address each time you load a website, which helps make it even more difficult to track you online. ExpressVPN’s kill switch works as advertised and we encountered no leaks in our latest tests. The VPN employs industry-standard AES 256-bit and ChaCha20 encryption with its Lightway protocol and also supports OpenVPN and IKEv2 protocols. Its TrustedServer technology takes the RAM-only server infrastructure to the next level by reinstalling the entire server stack in addition to wiping any data with every reboot.ExpressVPN’s Lightway protocol makes it one of the best VPNs to use on your phone. Like the WireGuard VPN protocol, ExpressVPN’s proprietary equivalent Lightway plays well with both Wi-Fi and mobile data connections, so your signal won’t drop out if you have to switch between the two regularly. It’s significantly lighter than OpenVPN, draining less battery from your phone when you’re connected to a VPN server, which may keep you from constantly needing to recharge your phone.Like any app, using ExpressVPN will take up some of your phone's battery life. Figures released by ExpressVPN suggest that you can expect around 140% more battery usage while your VPN is active compared to your baseline battery consumption on an iPhone while streaming video content like Netflix. In ExpressVPN’s testing, running Netflix for an hour on an iPhone 15 consumed 10% of the battery life without the ExpressVPN app enabled, compared to 24% when the VPN was connected. That’s a pretty significant chunk of your power. It’s quite a different picture on Android, where Express recorded a 21% drop in battery power on a Google Pixel 6A without the VPN, compared to 35% with the VPN turned on. In comparison, that’s only a 67% increase in power consumption. As both of these figures come from devices streaming Netflix, they may not exactly reflect what you can expect depending on your real-world activities. Also, it’s not clear whether these figures are taken from devices using OpenVPN or Lightway (or both).ExpressVPN is a well-rounded VPN and one of the very best you can buy. The catch is that you’ll pay a premium. The monthly subscription plan costs $13 per month, which is pretty standard across the industry. But you’ll pay $75 for the first 15 months or $98 total for the first 28 months (the one- and two-year plans renew at $100 a year). Those prices are approximately in line with what its closest competitor, NordVPN, charges: $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $81 for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $140 per year). Other top VPNs like Surfshark and Proton VPN are considerably cheaper. Surfshark costs $48 for the first year or $60 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually). Proton VPN is $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 per year). ExpressVPN offers a seven-day free trial, followed by a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you have the opportunity to try the service before buying or fully committing.Also featured in: Best VPN 2025, Best VPN for Android

Why we like it Surfshark is a solid option for anyone looking for a premium VPN experience for a cheaper price than ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Surfshark boasts an impressive roster of useful premium features that deliver a lot of value despite a recent renewal price hike. It can’t quite match NordVPN’s speed or ExpressVPN’s overall privacy position, but it comes remarkably close at a cheaper price. All in all, Surfshark is a top-notch VPN that demonstrates consistent improvement year after year.Why we like itSurfshark’s apps are slick, simple to use and deliver a consistent user experience across platforms, including Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, Apple TV, Fire TV and Android TV. Streaming enthusiasts will appreciate that Surfshark does a good job of unblocking content on most platforms and streaming services and that it offers apps for smart TVs as well as streaming devices. Other than a few minor hiccups, Surfshark’s streaming experience was solid, which we would expect from a top-tier VPN service, and it offers unlimited simultaneous connections while most VPNs limit you to 10 or fewer.We’re impressed with Surfshark’s consistently fast speeds over the past few years, with an average speed loss hovering in the high teens. We measured an average speed loss of 21% in our 2025 speed tests -- which is technically slower than previous years, but shouldn’t result in a noticeable difference in practice. Surfshark’s network of over 3,200 servers across 100 different countries is large, but somewhat smaller than those provided by ExpressVPN (105 countries), Proton VPN (122 countries) and NordVPN (126 countries). A large network of servers like what Surfshark offers can help ensure fast speeds and stable connections by minimizing congestion and offering more options for more users to connect to servers nearby their physical location.

In addition to standard privacy protections like its kill switch, no-logs policy and DNS leak protection, Surfshark includes a few unique features that help it stand out from the pack. Dynamic Multihop lets you tunnel through any two server locations of your choosing for an added layer of privacy, and Rotating IP switches your IP address every few minutes, making it harder to track you online. Surfshark’s Alternative ID lets you create an alter-ego complete with full name, physical address, and email address that you can use online without divulging your true identity. Following the lead of other VPN providers including ExpressVPN, Mullvad and NordVPN, Surfshark plans to roll out post-quantum protections this year to protect against potential future threats from quantum computers. Even though Surfshark is still playing catchup in terms of transparency, we’re encouraged by company representatives telling us that a no-logs audit has been commissioned for this year (its first since 2022) and that the company is committing to annual third-party audits.Surfshark provides some experimental data on how much battery you’d expect the VPN service to take up on iPhones and Android devices. Unfortunately, it’s unclear if these tests were conducted over Wi-Fi or mobile data. On the iPhone XS, Surfshark suggests you can expect around 41% more power consumed when a VPN is in use. In Surfshark’s benchmarks, the battery dropped  17% when not connected to the VPN versus 24% with a VPN enabled. The Android result is a bit better, with a OneTouch 8T using up 3% battery to stream without a VPN and 4% with a VPN, resulting in only 33% more battery consumption. These results have been taken from devices actively streaming YouTube videos, so they may represent battery consumption while your device is being used.While Surfshark’s $15.45 per month rate makes it one of the most expensive monthly subscription prices in the industry, pricing for its longer-term plans is reasonable. The yearly plan costs $48 for the first year and the two-year plan costs $60 total for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $79 annually). Surfshark’s renewal prices increased this year, but its overall pricing is still significantly cheaper than ExpressVPN’s 75 for the 15 months or $98 total for the 28 months (the one- and two-year plans renew at $100 annually), as well as NordVPN’s $60 for the first year or $81 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $140 a year). And like many other VPNs, Surfshark offers a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you’re not satisfied with the service.     Also featured in: Best VPN for iPhone, Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video

Why we like it NordVPN is the best VPN for users who need blazing-fast speeds for 4K video streaming, competitive online gaming or lag-free Zoom calls. It also offers a handful of privacy-boosting options and some innovative features like Meshnet. While Express remains slightly ahead in privacy and transparency and other VPNs offer cheaper long-term prices, NordVPN still provides an impressive all-around service that continues to improve. In July 2025, NordVPN revealed a spam call protection feature on Android, making it an even more compelling VPN for Android users.Why we like itNordVPN is the fastest VPN we tested by a long shot, with a best-in-class 3% average internet download speed loss -- its closest competitor was Proton at 16% speed loss. In our testing, we found NordVPN an excellent choice for streaming, with effortless unblocking of foreign Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Max libraries. Additionally, we had no issues watching BBC iPlayer, CBC Gem, Hulu, Crunchyroll and several other regional streaming services. Coupled with fast speeds, its excellent region-restricted content unblocking makes Nord one of the best VPNs for streaming. With a sizable roster of 8,000-plus servers peppering 126 countries, NordVPN is excellent for international travel and streaming, especially since its global reach is slightly more than Proton VPN, Surfshark and ExpressVPN. Its 10-device simultaneous device allowance is excellent for power users with many devices. While some providers, like Surfshark and PIA, offer unlimited simultaneous device policies, Nord’s longtime rival ExpressVPN limits you to eight.
Read more
We like that NordVPN’s strong privacy chops go beyond the basics. Alongside the industry-standard NordLynx (WireGuard-based) and OpenVPN VPN protocols, Nord offers its proprietary obfuscation-oriented NordWhisper, which masquerades as traditional web traffic to try slipping through firewalls. NordWhisper could be helpful in situations like on school Wi-Fi, when the network you’re on doesn’t play nicely with VPNs. You’ll get double VPN (which uses a second VPN connection) and Onion over VPN servers (which use Tor) to make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to its source compared to a standard VPN connection. Meshnet lets you create a virtual local network of PCs, mobile devices and streaming devices for secure file sharing, hosting LAN parties or accessing services like Netflix without pesky multi-factor authentication.NordVPN offers extensive details on how the VPN app affects your battery life. While the company’s testing does not include information on how iPhone devices perform, it does suggest that Android performance while streaming video is roughly the same whether the VPN is turned on or off. While using a Google Pixel 6 to stream YouTube for an hour, the battery dropped 8.78% while the VPN was turned off, whereas using NordLynx drained the battery by 8.83% and using OpenVPN consumed 8.89%. Although the difference is relatively small, it does suggest NordLynx performs slightly better than OpenVPN when streaming video. If these results are accurate, that means NordVPN vastly outperforms Surfshark and ExpressVPN when it comes to battery consumption.Initially, NordVPN is a great value at $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $81 total for the first two years. However, the one- and two-year plans renew at an astronomical $140 per year, which is considerably more than the $79 to $80 that Surfshark and Proton VPN renew for, but in the same ballpark as ExpressVPN's $100 a year renewal price. Although you can avoid a pricey renewal price hike by stacking subscriptions, we’d like to see Nord’s pricing model be more transparent. Despite its extortionate renewal price, NordVPN is a superb VPN for everyone from streaming fanatics to folks with critical privacy needs.Also featured in: Best VPN for Netflix, Fastest VPN

What is the best mobile VPN right now?
ExpressVPN is currently CNET's top pick for the best mobile VPN, thanks to its reliability, responsiveness and ease of use. In our testing, we appreciated ExpressVPN's user-friendly design, which remains intuitive on Android devices and iPhones. We also liked the fast internet speeds and the excellent streaming service unblocking. ExpressVPN's proprietary Lightway VPN protocol has been built from the ground up to handle seamless connection changes between Wi-Fi and mobile data while saving on battery life.

What is a mobile VPN?
Using a virtual private network on your mobile device keeps your internet data -- like apps you use and websites you visit -- private from your ISP or mobile provider. When you connect to the internet from a smartphone or tablet with a VPN, your data is sent through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server, which acts as your gateway to the rest of the internet. If you're connecting to a server in a different area, like a different city, state or country, you'll be able to access geographically restricted services, like streaming BBC iPlayer outside of the UK or watching international Netflix libraries while you're traveling.Some wireless carriers throttle, or slow down, certain types of traffic, but with a VPN enabled, your mobile phone company can’t tell what app or website you’re using. Accordingly, streaming with a VPN can give you better streaming video quality on mobile because your carrier may opt to slow down bandwidth-intensive traffic to keep network costs down. This also means you'll be able to bypass censorship in certain situations where there may be content restrictions, like in other countries or on school or work networks. Some VPNs also offer obfuscation, which disguises the fact that you're using a VPN altogether. Our CNET experts have extensively tested both Android and iOS VPN apps to bring you the best mobile VPNs. In our hands-on testing, we analyzed value for money, evaluated server speeds by running hundreds of internet speed tests per provider, unblocking streaming sites, examining app user experiences and poring over privacy policies. We've also scrutinized how the Android and iOS experiences compare to their desktop client app counterparts.

Factors to consider in a mobile VPN
There are hundreds of VPNs available, and with so many of them offering mobile apps, it can be difficult to choose the right solution for your iOS or Android phone or tablet. Based on our extensive research and hands-on testing of VPNs over the years, these are the factors to look out for when choosing the best mobile VPN for your needs and budget:PrivacyIf there’s anything you can’t compromise on while choosing a VPN, it’s privacy. Your VPN should be using industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption (with the OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 with WireGuard, along with foundational privacy protections like a kill switch, DNS leak protection and an audited no-logs policy. Most VPNs offer a VPN protocol selection, and generally, we’ve found WireGuard and its derivatives or equivalents faster than OpenVPN or IKEv2.If you have heightened privacy needs, you'll need a VPN provider that's based in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction. You should also look for a VPN company that provides obfuscation and has a RAM-only server architecture. Additional privacy features to look out for include Tor over VPN functionality, which uses Tor to make it even harder to trace your traffic back to its source, ad and tracker blockers and multi-hop connections, which make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to its source using multiple VPN connections. These features can offer increased privacy, but aren't absolutely essential for casual users. It's also a good idea to choose a VPN that has a proven track record of being both trustworthy and transparent. One of the best ways to immediately tell whether a VPN provider is confident in its privacy policy is whether it regularly publishes the results of audits commissioned by a trustworthy third party. Audits don’t paint a full privacy picture, but can still be important trust signals.  SpeedYour mobile VPN's connection speeds can have a major influence on the quality of your streaming, downloading, video conferencing, gaming and general web browsing activities. To keep things running as smoothly as possible, you'll want a VPN that will have as minimal of an impact on your regular internet speeds as possible, whether you're using Wi-Fi or mobile data.  Here's how VPNs we tested stacked up, speed-wise. ProviderSpeed loss ExpressVPN 18%Surfshark 21%NordVPN 3%
UsabilityA mobile VPN should have all of the features you need easily accessible with a tap of your finger. Many mobile VPN apps include a help section with easy ways to get in touch with support or access troubleshooting documentation directly from the device, which can be helpful if you need assistance on the go. The VPN should have a large network of servers around the world so you can connect easily and reliably from wherever you may be traveling, and it should be able to help you access geo-restricted content from various regions if that's what you want to use it for. You should also think about device support. IKEv2 or WireGuard should be your go-to for mobile devices because both are typically faster and more energy efficient than OpenVPN. Some VPN providers feature proprietary protocols like ExpressVPN's Lightway, which ExpressVPN claims has been built from the ground up for solid mobile connectivity, or NordVPN’s NordLynx.The chances of you bumping into a hacker on public Wi-Fi is low, but if you’re worried about man-in-the-middle attacks or data interception, you may want public Wi-Fi protection. Public Wi-Fi protection automatically enables your VPN on certain networks to mask your browsing activity.In addition to running a VPN on Android phones like the Google Pixel 9 XL or an iPhone like the 16 Pro Max, you may want to install a virtual private network on your computer, tablet and streaming device. Make sure the VPN provider you're considering supports all of the gadgets you need to use a VPN with.CostConsider the cost and overall value of your mobile VPN before making a purchase. VPN pricing varies greatly from provider to provider, but you can typically expect to spend about $5 to $13 per month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. If you want to save money over the long term, you can opt for an annual subscription, where prices can range from roughly $30 to $100 per year. You'll want to be careful with free VPNs because you may risk your privacy instead of protecting it when using one. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET enthusiastically recommends. Most premium VPNs offer a money-back guarantee that can be anywhere from a week to 45 days. You can also get a seven-day free trial with many VPNs when you sign up through Apple's App Store or the Google Play Store. So you have options to try various mobile VPNs risk-free before deciding whether to fully invest in one.Streaming
Many folks rely on VPNs for streaming service content unblocking. For instance, you can use a virtual private network to make apps and websites think you're in a different city, state or even country. Bypassing geographical restrictions may let you unlock foreign Netflix, Disney Plus or Amazon Prime Video libraries, watch movies and shows on sites like BBC iPlayer or enjoy out-of-market NFL games. You may even be able to save money on streaming service subscriptions by using a VPN. The best mobile VPNs not only do a great job unblocking geo-protected content, but also give you access to a wide range of server locations. The more countries you can connect to, the greater the amount of content you have access to from all over the globe.Mobile streaming performance often differs from desktop due to app-specific detection methods. Streaming services, like YouTube TV, rely on GPS data for geo-location, so a VPN connection won’t make it look like you’re in a different region. Using VPN apps that have GPS spoofing on Android -- like Surfshark -- can help. But you also may want to stream through your browser instead of your app for the best results.Mobile app designThe best mobile VPN apps feature a mobile-specific design that allows you to easily find server status indicators and access settings in a way that isn’t cluttered and cramped. Look for apps that are clearly designed and don’t overwhelm you with too many options on a single page or use fiddly, undersized widgets for changing server locations, as they can be difficult to use on the go.Battery consumptionVPN battery impact can vary significantly between providers, protocols and devices. It’ll also depend on the existing battery health of your device. Generally, we’re confident that WireGuard and IKEv2 will provide better battery efficiency on your device compared to OpenVPN. We’ve seen plenty of testing numbers from different VPN providers, but there’s no general consensus on exactly how much a VPN will drain your battery. Plus, testing was conducted in those cases by the various VPN companies themselves, so we’ve taken their reporting with a grain (or two) of salt. Using a VPN means you're running an app on your phone and consuming bandwidth, both of which will drain your battery faster than not having a VPN enabled.Network switchingSeamless transitions between Wi-Fi and cellular data are essential for mobile VPNs. The best providers offer VPN protocols that keep your connection going during network changes, automatically reconnecting between Wi-Fi and cellular data as well as preserving your privacy during transitions by preventing IP address leaks.Data consumption impactBecause a VPN encrypts your web traffic, using one increases your mobile data or Wi-Fi usage. NordVPN suggests this figure is somewhere between 4 to 20% for mobile data encryption. Bandwidth consumption varies by VPN protocol and encryption level. iOS vs. Android differencesAs with all VPN apps, you’re likely to run into at least minor differences between iOS and Android apps even when they’re offered by the same provider. The biggest issue from a VPN perspective is that very few clients offer split tunneling on iOS. Apple restricts the ability of apps to manage other app networking on the iOS platform, so most VPN clients don’t offer any implementation of split tunneling, with some notable exceptions, like Surfshark’s Bypasser mode. However, Bypasser on iOS -- unlike on Windows and Android -- only works for websites, not websites and apps. If you’re unsure, you should check first to see if there’s feature parity between both apps. How we tested mobile VPNs
Our VPN testing process draws from years of experience provided by CNET’s team of experts. We examine VPNs across more than 20 factors. We tested both iOS and Android versions for each VPN to test for speed loss, DNS leaks, streaming, user experience and overall feature sets. We've also highlighted the difference between the iOS and Android experience for each provider's apps, where pertinent, as there are usually at least some slight differences in features between the two platforms, and you may be more interested in one or the other. Ultimately, every VPN we’ve highlighted here is a great choice for your mobile device, regardless of which platform you’re on, but one may be a better fit for you over another, depending on your budget or individual circumstances.For speed testing, we conducted over 250 individual internet speed tests per provider using multiple servers around the world and with different VPN protocols to gauge internet speed loss. Additionally, we checked for DNS leaks, ensured all major features like kill switches were functioning correctly and assessed streaming service unblocking capabilities. We also pored over privacy policies, perused transparency reports and analyzed audit results.

Other VPNs we tested
Proton VPNProton VPN is a highly private, open-source VPN solution from the Swiss-based privacy company Proton. Proton VPN holds the distinction as the only free VPN that CNET thoroughly recommends, and it's the mobile VPN for you if you're looking for a top-quality service without having to pay a dime. With Proton VPN's free plan, you get access to just five server locations (US, Japan, Poland, Romania and the Netherlands). But unlike most free VPNs, Proton VPN doesn't limit your usage in any way. Unfortunately, there’s no way of picking which server you’ll get connected to when you use Proton’s free service, so it’s not ideal for activities like streaming content. Proton VPN has made this change to reduce the load that free users take on the service, so you’re most likely to be connected to whichever free server is closest to you. Most free VPNs are essentially useless for anything other than the most basic online activities, but I had no issues streaming Netflix on Android and iOS using Proton VPN's free servers. If you want to pay for Proton and get access to all its servers and privacy features, it's relatively inexpensive compared to the competition, at $10 a month, $60 a year or $108 total for two years (the one- and two-year plans spike to $80 annually upon renewal). On Android phones, tablets and Chromebooks, you can select discreet app icons -- rather than the Proton VPN app icon, your VPN app will instead be disguised as Notes, Weather or Calculator, thereby hiding that you've got a VPN installed. There's even a credential-less login option for Proton VPN Android users, so you can start using Proton without signing up for an account. According to a Nov. 5, 2024 blog post, Proton is slated to bring its guest mode to iOS and iPadOS.Proton VPN's iOS/iPadOS and Android apps are nearly identical but with a few minor differences in appearance and available features. The Quick Connect button lets you easily hop onto an optimal server. The Android app lets you easily connect to a recent server, or you can toggle on Fastest to jump on the server with the quickest internet speeds -- which should be geographically nearby. You can also browse a list of all 122 countries with the paid premium plan. Both apps also include a kill switch and give you the option of using Proton VPN's NetShield feature to block malware, tracking and ads. All told, Proton is one of the best mobile VPNs with both its free and paid plans. Read our Proton VPN review.PIAPIA is a budget-friendly VPN that’s cheaper than most competitors at $12 per month, $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 total for three years of service. PIA also offers unlimited simultaneous connections, a benefit that pricier VPNs like Proton, ExpressVPN and NordVPN don’t have. It’s suitable for streaming service unblocking, provides a solid network of 35,000-plus servers in 91 countries and has highly customizable, albeit a bit unpolished, apps. Folks who live in or frequently travel to the US may appreciate PIA’s servers in all 50 of the United States -- which can be helpful for streaming regional sports, like NFL games. We like that its apps are open-source, meaning anyone can inspect the source code for bugs or vulnerabilities, which is solid transparency. Only a few other providers, including Proton VPN and Mullvad, have open-source apps. While PIA largely sticks to covering the basics, it features some neat privacy amenities, including split tunneling on MacOS (which lets you use a VPN for certain apps and services but not others) -- a rarity among VPN providers. Notably, Surfshark also has Mac split tunneling. Unfortunately, PIA was rough around the edges in our latest round of testing. We clocked its internet speed loss at an underwhelming 49% average, higher than the 25% average we like to see. Additionally, we encountered many CAPTCHAs while trying to perform basic tasks like running a Google search. Although streaming was largely decent, we had to change servers more often than with other providers, like NordVPN, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN or Surfshark. You can get Surfshark, which delivers far faster speeds, a better streaming experience and more forward-thinking privacy features, for a little more money. Still, PIA is a good budget pick for folks who need comprehensive US server coverage. Otherwise, your money is probably better spent on Surfshark or Proton VPN, both of which offer faster server performance and robust privacy while charging slightly more cash than PIA.Read our PIA reviewIPVanishIPVanish’s mobile apps look slick, but if you want better performance and functionality out of your mobile VPN at a similar price or cheaper, you’re better off going with one of our top picks listed above. (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). To be fair, IPVanish’s mobile apps are functional, and you’ll be able to achieve sufficient online privacy and unblock regional streaming content on your mobile device with it. Its speeds are on the slower end of the spectrum (we measured a 44% average internet speed loss in our 2024 testing), its server network is relatively small and its data-sharing practices have us raising our eyebrows. That, in combination with its curiously high pricing, is largely why IPVanish misses the cut here.Read our IPVanish review.

ExpressVPN remains the best mobile VPN with an unparalleled user experience. Although ExpressVPN is more expensive compared to Surfshark and NordVPN, there are plenty of positives that justify the higher price. Most notably, the sheer ease of use, fantastic speeds and forward-thinking privacy features, like post-quantum protection.  We’ve removed Private Internet Access from our top recommendations due to its significant speed loss. The mobile apps are acceptable if you need a VPN app that can customize your OpenVPN packet settings for speed or encryption strength, or you’re looking for comprehensive coverage in the US, thanks to its servers in all 50 of the United States. NordVPN released NordWhisper, an obfuscation protocol designed to evade VPN blocks by disguising your VPN traffic as traditional web traffic. It’s not fully rolled out yet, but you can currently access it on Android, Android TV, Windows and Linux. Surfshark recently added a form of split tunneling to its OS app, which allows you to choose which websites bypass the VPN tunnel. Several providers -- including ExpressVPN and NordVPN -- have debuted post-quantum protection to guard against threats from quantum computers, like hacking.

A word of caution about VPNs on iOS
There's been a fair amount of chatter from VPN companies and independent researchers over the past few years about iOS devices leaking data outside of the VPN tunnel unencrypted. Proton VPN outlined a potential workaround that could be universally applied to other iOS VPN apps. The trick is to connect to a VPN server, and then enable and disable Airplane mode. This should kill all existing processes connected to the internet on the device and allow them to reconnect through the VPN tunnel. To be clear, this issue is on Apple's side and affects all VPNs on iOS devices, so it didn't influence my assessment of the top mobile VPNs, but is nonetheless crucial for iOS users to know. The vulnerability was reported to be present since at least iOS 13. Apple has not responded to multiple requests for comment on the issue, including whether the company plans to issue a fix ahead of the expected release of its latest mobile operating system, iOS 18.

What does my ISP/mobile carrier see when I'm connected to my mobile VPN?
Whether you're connected to Wi-Fi or using your mobile VPN on a cellular network, the provider supplying the internet connection will only see that you're connected to a VPN. Your ISP or mobile carrier won't see your internet activity or the websites you visit, but will see the IP address of the VPN server you're connected to, the amount of data you're transmitting and the timestamps of when you were connected to the VPN. You can connect to a "stealth" or obfuscated server, if offered by your VPN, and hide from your provider that you're connected to a VPN if you need additional privacy.

What does a mobile VPN do that's different from a regular VPN?
Simply put, a mobile VPN is a virtual private network app designed to run on phones and tablets. Primarily, mobile VPNs seamlessly switch back and forth between cellular and Wi-Fi networks. Good mobile VPN apps are optimized for smartphone and tablet touchscreens instead of feeling like you need a keyboard and mouse to navigate them.
Show more
Will a VPN drain my phone's battery?
Mobile VPN apps will have some impact on the battery consumption of your phone. This depends significantly on which protocol you use, as WireGuard and IKEv2 tend to consume less battery than OpenVPN. There aren’t a lot of great numbers out there from researchers, so where possible, we’ve relied on research published by the VPN providers themselves to gauge how much extra battery a VPN might consume.
Show more
Does a VPN work on both Wi-Fi and cellular data?
Your VPN should generally encrypt Wi-Fi and cellular data signals. However, there may be cases where either your ISP or mobile provider blocks access to a VPN. You’ll either need to use an obfuscated protocol or switch to another network to potentially keep using your VPN. Quality mobile VPNs seamlessly switch between both connection types without breaking the encrypted tunnel. Having a mobile vpn that can switch networks without dropping your connection or leaking your public IP address is essential if you’re traveling while using a VPN.
Show more
How do I know if my mobile VPN is working?
You can check if your mobile VPN is working by making sure your public IP address is masked while your VPN is enabled, and checking for DNS leaks, which are easy and important VPN tests to perform. Some VPNs will show the public IP address of the VPN server you’re connected to in the app, but otherwise, you can check by visiting a site like whatismyipaddress.com on your mobile browser. If you visit the site without connecting to a VPN, it will show you the public IP address assigned by your ISP. Connect to the VPN and check the site again; you should see that your IP address has changed to the one associated with the VPN server you’ve connected to. You can also use dnsleaktest.com to see if your mobile VPN is leaking DNS requests, which could reveal both your IP and the sites you’re visiting to your ISP.
Show more
Are free mobile VPN apps safe to use?
As a rule of thumb, no. You should not download a free mobile VPN. Most free mobile VPN apps are unsafe and often sell user data to advertisers or contain malware. Proton VPN's free tier is the only free option we recommend, as we’re confident the company offers genuine privacy as a result of its annual third-party audits and no-logs policy. Even if a free VPN provider isn’t selling your data, they are usually heavily restricted in terms of the locations you can connect to and use bandwidth limits to keep you from fully taking advantage of the VPN.
Show more
How do VPNs affect mobile data usage?
A VPN will increase your mobile data usage, since you’re adding another app that sends and receives data -- your VPN -- on top of the other app or apps you’re using. Additionally, all VPNs usually slow down your internet speeds, even if marginally, with the fastest VPNs reducing your internet download speeds by an average of 25% or less. As a result, a VPN will slow down your mobile data speeds.
Show more
Can I use a VPN on my tablet?
Yes, tablets support the same VPN apps as their Android and iOS smartphone counterparts. Some providers, such as ExpressVPN and NordVPN, will offer iPad and Android tablet apps that have enhanced interfaces optimized for larger screens, like tablets and Chromebooks.
Show more
Will a mobile VPN let me stream from other countries?
Mobile VPN apps can unblock geo-restricted streaming content, but success varies by service and provider. In general, you should be able to stream content from other countries. However, if you’re struggling to access Netflix, Disney Plus and other platforms from the apps they provide, you can try changing user profiles in that streaming app. Alternatively, with your VPN off, you can try force closing the app, clearing your app cache and data, enabling your VPN and connecting to a desired server then opening up the app, logging in and trying to stream.
Show more
What's the iOS VPN leak issue everyone talks about?
iOS devices have a known vulnerability where some traffic can bypass the VPN tunnel if the connection was made before the VPN was turned on. This affects all VPNs on iOS, not specific providers. The workaround involves connecting to your VPN, then enabling and disabling Airplane mode to force all connections through the VPN tunnel. To date, Apple has not fixed the functionality in iOS that causes this to happen.
