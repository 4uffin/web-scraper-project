26 of the Best TV Shows to Stream on Disney Plus
The Disney-owned streamer has Marvel, Star Wars and so much more.

Kathryn Hahn, Joe Locke, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn and Patti LuPone star in Marvel's Agatha All Along on Disney Plus. Marvel Television
Disney Plus is one of the big dogs in streaming entertainment, and it only took half a decade to get here. The Walt Disney name carries huge value, and when it comes to Mouse House programming, Disney Plus is where it's at. So, it should come as no surprise when I call this one of the best streaming services out there. It may be a bold statement but where else can you find Andor, Bluey and Daredevil hanging out all under one roof? Then there are all the Marvel and Star Wars titles in the streamer's library. All this Disney epicness is just a click away.Disney Plus also has an array of Disney classics and original titles well worth your time. Do you want family-friendly shows, educational docuseries or fun reality programs? They're all here. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Read more: Disney Plus Review: More Than Just Child's PlaySign up for Disney Plus

Disney/Pixar
Dream Productions
Dream Productions takes place between the events of Inside Out and Inside Out 2 and heads back into the mind of young Riley. Instead of focusing on her emotions, this four-episode mockumentary-style series delves into the production company in charge of her dreams. As Riley grows, her emotions require extra processing, and that's where the folks at Dream Productions come in. Paula Pell and Richard Ayoade star; the voices of Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Tony Hale, Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are also featured.
Marvel
Ironheart
The newest Marvel series to hit Disney Plus takes place following the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and follows Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) as she creates her own suit of armor inspired by Tony Stark's. Part coming-of-age story and part journey of self-discovery, the series finds the brilliant young woman grappling the with intersection of magic and technology while striving to find her place in the world.
National Geographic
Underdogs
You may be used to animal series narrated by the likes of, say, Sir. Richard Attenborough or Morgan Freeman, to add gravitas to the informative program. Underdogs takes a different route. Ryan Reynolds takes the voice-over helm on this one to explore Mother Nature's odd creatures. Misfits to some, weirdos to others, the Deadpool star gives these quirky animals their due in this fun series.
Des Willie/Lucasfilm Ltd.
Andor
Simply put, I think Andor is the best Star Wars series Disney Plus has made. The program ditches the flashy, and often clichéd, production values of its predecessors and goes all-in on some intense ground-level storytelling. Expanding the story of the characters featured in the one-off film Rogue One, Andor comes through with the emotional stakes thanks to its smart writing and the excellent performances of its cast. Phenomenal stuff, right here.
Giovanni Rufino/Marvel Television
Daredevil: Born Again
Daredevil: Born Again finds Matt Murdock once again fighting for justice, both in the courtroom and on the streets. The series acts as a reboot of sorts and reunites Charlie Cox with Vincent D'Onofrio's (who reprises his role as Wilson Fisk) to once again battle for the soul of Hell's Kitchen. Check out our bone-crushing review of the series.
Marvel Animation
Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
A new spin on Spider-Man lore unfolds in the streamer's new animated series, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. The show, presented in a nostalgic animation style, explores a different timeline in which Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) is mentored by Norman Osborn (Colman Domingo), who you may know better as the villainous Green Goblin. This'll be interesting.
Pixar
Win or Lose
Pixar's first original animated series follows a middle school softball team and their journey to the championship. The eight-episode season takes place over one week and follows different characters as they explore the same events from different perspectives. SNL alums Will Forte and Melissa Villaseñor lend their voices alongside Better Call Saul's Rhea Seehorn, Lil Rey Howery, Rosa Salazar, Flula Borg and Jo Firestone.
Disney/Francisco Roman
Goosebumps
Justin Long led the first installment of Disney Plus' YA series, and David Schwimmer takes up the mantle of creepy adult in the show's second season. The gateway horror series takes inspiration from R.L. Stine's iconic book series. Each season follows a group of teens wrapped up in a supernatural mystery.
Matt Kennedy/Lucafilm Ltd.
Star Wars: Skeleton Crew
Star Wars: Skeleton Crew dials the tone back to the Amblin days of the 1980s. There's no trace of Luke Skywalker in this show. Instead, Skeleton Crew takes place in a reality where stories of the Jedi are viewed as fairy tales. That is, until a ragtag group of kids stumble upon an abandoned starship and accidentally shoot themselves into space. The result: a (literally) out-of-this-world adventure.
Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel
Agatha All Along
Agatha All Along isn't a direct sequel to WandaVision, but the stories are definitely related. Kathryn Hahn reprises her deliciously devilish role in the spooky new series, which follows Agatha and a group of ragtag witches on a journey down the Witches Road to help Ms. Harkness get her powers back. Spoiler: It ain't gonna be easy.
Lucasfilm Ltd.
Star Wars: Visions
Star Wars: Visions is a fun and edgy animated anthology series that adds an exciting new element to Lucasfilm's long-established franchise. Seven Japanese animation studios were tapped to create nine unique noncanonical episodes for the program. Additional episodes from Spain, Ireland, Chile, the United Kingdom, South Korea, France, India, Japan and South Africa were released in the show's second installment.
Disney Plus
Doctor Who
Doctor Who kicked off 60 years ago, and since then, the sci-fi series has been revamped multiple times. Actors like David Tennant and Matt Smith helped bring the iconic Time Lord into the present day with the program's run of modern era seasons. Ncuti Gatwa is the latest actor to take the reins as the Doctor, marking the first time in the program's history that a Black actor has stepped into the role. Doctor Who made the move to Disney Plus in 2023. New episodes (starting with season 14) will exclusively air on the streamer.
Ludo Studio
Bluey
Bluey is a phenomenon, plain and simple. The kids' show, which follows a family of anthropomorphic dogs -- Bluey, her sister Bingo, dad Bandit and mom Chilli -- was the most streamed series in 2023, and for good reason. Nearly all the episodes run at around 8 minutes in length, making it an easy binge. And while the tone remains light and playful, the series digs into relevant and poignant topics in a way that never talks down to its audience. Who knew a show about an Australian dog family would be so addictive? Disney Plus knew.
Disney Plus
Percy Jackson and the Olympians
This fresh take on Rick Riordan's cherished books aims to erase the live-action movies from our collective memories. And for the most part, it accomplishes its task. The eight-episode first season follows the events of Lightning Thief, the first book in the series. Thanks to a younger cast and lighter stakes, this Percy Jackson series is positioned to be a YA hit for Disney Plus.
Lucasfilm Ltd.
The Mandalorian
Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau took their love of Star Wars to new heights with The Mandalorian. It's the first live-action Star Wars series to hit Disney Plus and it set the standard for everything that came after. Stylistically inspired by things like the Lone Wolf and Cub manga, Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo and Sergio Leone's iconic Dollars trilogy (which starred Clint Eastwood as the Man With No Name), the series follows a lone bounty hunter who gets a second chance at life when he's hired to protect a little green alien you may know simply as Baby Yoda.
Apple Corps Ltd
The Beatles: Get Back
This three-part documentary series puts us smack-dab in the creative maelstrom of one of the world's biggest musical groups. Directed by Oscar-winner Peter Jackson, The Beatles: Get Back gives a cinéma vérité-style look at a band at the top of their game and on the precipice of collapse. This previously unseen footage shows John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in rehearsal for their infamous rooftop concert at their Apple Corps headquarters on London's Savile Row. It was their last live performance. It's breathtaking, inspiring and heartbreaking. And definitely worth a watch.
Marvel Studios
What If...?
If you've ever wondered what may have happened if things turned out differently for your favorite Marvel heroes and villains, Marvel's What If...? is the show for you. The animated anthology series is based on the comic book of the same name and asks, "What if key events in the MCU never happened?" Peggy Carter can totally become Captain America and the Avengers may turn into brain-hungry zombies. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of what Marvel's What If...? is bringing to the table. Read our full What If... ? review here.
Marvel Animation
X-Men '97
X-Men: The Animated Series ended its five-season run in 1997. Almost three decades later, X-Men '97 continues the story of everyone's favorite mutant superhero crew. The pacing is quick, the writing is tight, and the 2D animation style acts as a nice bow tying together this lovely nostalgic gift for '90s kids everywhere.
Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios
Echo
Echo (Alaqua Cox) was first introduced in a three-episode arc in Hawkeye. Marvel's Echo is centered on the hearing-impaired antihero. She's also a member of the Choctaw Nation, which leads the series to wonderfully explore these aspects of her identity. Her association with Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) further connects the MCU shows on Disney Plus with those previously on Netflix -- and sets up the arrival of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) and crew quite nicely.
Lucasfilm Ltd.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch
The Bad Batch is an intense, action-packed spin-off of the celebrated Star Wars animated series The Clone Wars. Audiences have seen the fallout of Order 66 take shape in various forms throughout the Star Wars franchise, but never like this. The Bad Batch follows a squad of elite clone troopers with genetic defects. They may have special abilities, but that doesn't make them invisible to the top-secret execution order. In turn, the animated series fills in some blanks in Star Wars lore. It does so in an incredibly entertaining way.
Disney Plus
Ms. Marvel
Ms. Marvel is a breath of fresh air for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Disney Plus series flips the script on what we have grown to expect from Marvel shows on the streamer. Iman Vellani is a revelation as the titular hero. It's a challenge for a show to balance the heavy responsibilities of being a superhero with the trials and tribulations of high school. The story pulls it off, and does so with a welcome helping of Muslim representation.
Disney Plus
WandaVision
WandaVision started it all on Disney Plus. It's the first original series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to hit the streamer. It's a genre-bending adventure that finds Wanda and Vision living out different realities inspired by TV sitcoms, from I Love Lucy and The Dick Van Dyke Show to The Brady Bunch and Family Ties. How does the emotional fallout of Avengers: Endgame (and Vision's death, specifically) affect Wanda? Well, let's just say her grief takes her down one heck of a weird rabbit hole.Read our full WandaVision review.
Gareth Gatrell/Marvel/Disney Plus
Loki
Tom Hiddleston has appeared as Loki, the God of Mischief, throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past decade. Thanks to Disney Plus, he finally leads his own odd adventure. The quirky sci-fi series puts Loki in the unlikely position of hero. Here, he works with a barrage of interesting characters, including Owen Wilson's Mobius M. Mobius, to correct the timeline. It's an offbeat, fun and thoroughly weird series that appeals to die-hard fans and newbs alike.
Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
What happens when Captain America hangs up his shield? That's the question going into Marvel's The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Here, Sam Wilson (better known as Falcon) and Bucky Barnes (aka the Winter Soldier) buddy up in a surprisingly funny and heartfelt series that deals with trauma, grief and classism as the world picks up the pieces from the earth-shattering events of Avengers: Endgame.
Disney
Moon Knight
Moon Knight stars Oscar Isaac as Steven Grant, a troubled man with dissociative identity disorder. These aren't simple anxiety issues -- no, Grant actually shares his body with a mercenary named Marc Spector. The discovery of this alter-ego leads Grant on an adventure that pits him against a sinister cult leader named Arthur Harrow (Ethan Hawke) and a gang of formidable Egyptian gods. It's a trippy ride that may even scratch that Indiana Jones itch.Read our full Moon Knight review.
Disney Plus
Muppets Mayhem
Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem Band get top billing in Muppets Mayhem, Disney Plus's latest series inspired by Jim Henson's Muppets. Here, the Electric Mayhem Band struggles to record one more album. But record company politics and other past mistakes make things complicated for the crew -- and boy do those complications lead to some hilarious on-screen antics! Of all the Muppets programs to hit TV in recent years, Muppets Mayhem comes closest to the wacky, fun vibe of the original.
