A VPN isn't the only way you can change your IP address. Here are alternative options.  Getty Images/Viva Tung/CNET
Your public IP address is sort of like a street address; it's a unique string of numbers assigned by your internet service provider to identify your home internet network. In addition to your home network's public IP address, each device on your home internet network -- like laptops, gaming consoles and smartphones -- has a private IP address, which is a unique IP address assigned by your router. Your router needs to know the different devices that exist so it can "talk" with them. So there's a single public IP address shared among your internet-connected devices, but each of those gadgets has its own private IP address.Usually, you won't need to think about what your IP address is at all. However, you may need to occasionally change your IP address, like if you're concerned about privacy or need to access region-restricted streaming services, such as foreign Netflix libraries or watching BBC iPlayer outside of the UK. Using a virtual private network, or VPN, is the easiest way to make websites and internet-connected apps think you've got a different IP address -- that's what I use most frequently to hide my IP address. You can change or hide your IP address using multiple methods, depending on whether you need to alter your public or private IP address. VPNs, proxy servers, router reboots or manually obtaining new IP addresses are viable solutions. Here's everything you need to know about changing your IP address, from what an IP address is to which technique you should use based on your specific circumstances.Read more: Best VPN Service for 2025: Our Top Pick in a Tight RaceWhat is an IP address?An Internet Protocol -- or IP -- address is a unique string of numbers used to identify an internet-connected device. There are two types of IP addresses: public IP addresses and private IP addresses. An IP address falls within the ranges of 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255. A public IP address is like a street addressYour ISP assigns a public IP address to your router. Because your internet service provider doles this out to your router, you only have one public IP address, meaning if you look it up on your phone and laptop -- both connected to your Wi-Fi network -- it should show the same public IP address. Your public IP address is like a street address. Similar to your street address, your IP address contains information about your approximate geographical location because it normally includes your ISP's info. You can look up your own IP address using a website like the aptly-named WhatIsMyIPAddress, where you'll find information such as your internet service provider and your general region. Your private IP address is used by your router and home networkOn the other hand, a private IP address is only accessible by other devices on your local network -- meaning devices connected to your Wi-Fi router or hardwired into your modem. Most private IP addresses start with 192, 172 or 10 -- although public addresses can begin with a 192 or 172 as well. Each device on your home network has its own unique private IP address, whereas your router usually only has one public IP address.Why would you want to change your IP address?Often, you don't even have to think about your public and private IP addresses. But there are several reasons why you may want to change your IP address.Privacy: If you can view info like your ISP and general physical location by looking up your public IP address, other entities -- your ISP, websites you visit or apps you use -- can glean data about you from the websites you visit and apps you use. You might want to change your public IP address for privacy reasons. Streaming: Some apps and websites, like streaming services, are region-restricted, so you can't access them outside certain countries. A new public IP address from a specific country can help unblock geo-protected content, like foreign Netflix libraries.Throttling or censorship: You can change your public IP address to circumvent censorship, like viewing websites blocked by your government or school administration. Likewise, a fresh public IP address could allow you to bypass throttling restrictions from your ISP or mobile carrier.Troubleshooting: Changing your private IP address may help you get your device working again if there's an issue with its connectivity to your router or modem, which is helpful for IT troubleshooting.How to change your IP address using a VPN
James Martin/CNETVPNs, or virtual private networks, encrypt your internet traffic, making them solid tools for safeguarding your online privacy. If you're already paying for a VPN, you can also use it to disguise your public IP address. A VPN reroutes your traffic through an encrypted server so that apps and websites don't view your public IP, but that of the server you're connected to. Essentially, it makes apps or websites think you have a different public IP address. Your ISP can't see your online activity, like the apps you're using or websites you're visiting, and sites or apps view your traffic as originating from your VPN company's server. VPNs are great for situations where you want extra privacy, need to access geo-blocked content or have to bypass throttling restrictions and censorship. A doesn't change your device's private IP address.Here's how to hide your IP address with a VPN:Sign up for a plan with a VPN provider.Download and install a VPN app on your device.Open the newly installed VPN app and sign in.Enable your VPN and select your preferred server.The exact process for using a VPN varies slightly by device. You can quickly test whether your VPN is working correctly by looking up your IP address with your VPN toggled off and then on -- the IP addresses shouldn't match.How to change your IP address using a proxy serverA proxy server and VPN are similar because they're both middlemen between your device and the internet. Like VPNs, proxies hide your public IP address from apps and websites. However, a proxy server doesn't encrypt your connection, so the connection isn't as secure or private as a VPN. A proxy may work for basic pseudo-anonymity for web browsing or streaming videos, but for an encrypted connection, you'll need a virtual private network. Before I switched to a VPN, I used a proxy service -- GetFlix -- to unblock geo-restricted content, like streaming TV shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation while in the US.Setting up a proxy server differs depending on the platform you're using. Generally, you'll configure your proxy server address in your device's settings, enable your proxy and choose an IP address. Some proxy services include user-friendly apps, so you can just download an app, sign in, start your proxy and pick a server.How to change your IP address by resetting your router
Ry Crist/CNETRebooting your router is a simple method for obtaining a new private IP address:Check your device's IP address and make a note of it.Unplug your router for a minimum of 5 minutes (but depending on your ISP and router/modem, this could take longer).Plug your router back in -- it may take a few minutes for your internet connection to return.Reconnect your device to your network if it doesn't automatically do so.Recheck your private IP address -- this time, it should be different from what it was when you first looked.Your router assigns private IP addresses to each connected device, so resetting it is supposed to make it forget your gadget and dole out a fresh private IP address. Resetting your router may also give you a new public IP address, but this depends on how your ISP assigns IP addresses. If you still see the same public IP address from before after a router reboot, try resetting your router again or for a longer period of time -- even up to a day. Folks with a separate router and modem may need to reset both networking devices to obtain a new public IP address. And resetting your router to get a new public IP address only works if your ISP assigns a dynamic IP address, which some don't. How to change your private IP address automatically or manually
Sarah Tew/CNETWhile using a VPN or a proxy can change your public IP address, you may need to get a new private IP address. For instance, you may want to change your private IP address if you're experiencing internet connectivity issues on one specific device, or if you'd like to set a static IP address. Most devices let you easily update your private IP address automatically, meaning you won't need to know a free IP address to use, unlike manually configuring an IP. Updating your IP address automatically is more user-friendly -- you won't need to know a free IP address on your network to use. But sometimes you'll want to manually add an IP, like if you're running a home server and wish to assign a static IP address -- for example, I host a Plex server and have a static IP address set up. That way, when I want to transfer files to and from my Plex server, I can do so easily because that private IP address doesn't change. Here's how to update your IP address manually and automatically on different platforms.How to change your IP address on WindowsTo automatically refresh your IP address:Open the Run dialog box by simultaneously pressing the Windows key and R button (Win + R). Alternatively, you can head to the Start Menu and search for Run.Type CMD and tap Enter to open a command prompt.Type ipconfig /release and hit Enter to give up the current IP address of your Windows machine.Type ipconfig /renew and tap Enter to get a new IP address automatically.To manually update your IP address:Head to Start.Go to Settings.Select the Network & internet tab.Click Wi-Fi if you're using a wireless network or Ethernet for a wired connection.For Wi-Fi, select [network name] properties (for instance, my W-Fi name is WuTangSecret, so I clicked WuTangSecret properties). With Ethernet, you don't need to select anything else to get to the IP assignment screen.Next to IP assignment, click Edit.Click Manual.Toggle on IPv4 or IPv6, whichever you'd like to use or your router and modem support.Punch in the IP address you want to use.  Alternatively, you can switch your IP address from the Control Panel:Head to Start.Open the Control Panel.Click Network and Internet.Visit the Network and Sharing Center.Select your network.Choose Properties.Click TCP/IP.Punch in the IP address you want to use. How to change your IP address on MacTo automatically get a new IP address:Visit System Settings.Click Network.Select Wi-Fi, then the Details button next to your network.Select TCP/IP.Pick Renew DHCP Lease.To manually obtain a fresh IP address:Go to System Settings.Click Network.Select Wi-Fi, then the Details button next to your network.Click TCP/IP.Choose Configure IPv4 > Manually or Configure IPv6 > Manually.Type in your desired IP address.How to change your IP address on LinuxOpen the Application (you can do this by pressing the super key, which is the Windows button or Command key on an Apple keyboard).Launch the Connections application.Select your network, then click the IPv4 or IPv6 tab.Switch Method to Manual.Enter the IP address of your desired DNS server in the DNS Servers section.Note that these instructions might vary slightly depending on the specific Linux operating system you're using, but should generally be the same for most Debian-based OSes, like Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Linux Mint.How to change your IP address on AndroidHead to Settings.Tap Wi-Fi.Press the i button beside the Wi-Fi network you're connected to.To automatically get a new IP address: Tap Forget to disconnect from your wireless network — it's a trashcan icon.
