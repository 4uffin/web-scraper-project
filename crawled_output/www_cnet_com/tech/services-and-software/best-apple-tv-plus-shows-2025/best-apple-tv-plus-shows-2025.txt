Gary Oldman stars in Slow Horses on Apple TV Plus. Apple TV Plus
You really should be watching Apple TV Plus. I know, I know. The streamer's strategy of non-promotion for their shows has left many titles lurking under the radar. But I am here to tell you that a good chunk of those releases are well worth your time.You already know programs like Severance and Ted Lasso. Seth Rogen's freshman comedy The Studio took this year's Emmys by storm, taking home 13 wins, so obviously that is a show you should check out -- and I mention it in the list below. See at Apple TV PlusAside from those examples, there's a whole slew of good stuff you probably have never heard of that I think you should watch. Did you know Schitt's Creek star Eugene Levy hosts his own Emmy-nominated travel show? That's here. As is Jason Momoa's groundbreaking Polynesian-led drama about the unification of the Hawaiian Islands. And why not toss in a limited series about the hunt for Abraham Lincoln's killer while we're at it?I should note that this list does not include the platform's genre offerings. I put together a separate list of Apple TV Plus' best sci-fi TV shows. If you're looking for genre suggestions, you should check out that article. The 20 shows featured below are led by top-notch talent. These dramas, comedies and thrillers are well-written and push the envelope in some way. You want something thought-provoking, heart-wrenching or knee-slapping? You've come to the right place.

Apple TV Plus
The Studio
Seth Rogen co-created and stars in this dysfunctional comedy series about a movie studio's attempt at staying relevant in Hollywood. Ike Barinholtz, Kathryn Hahn, Catherine O'Hara, Chase Sui Wonders and Bryan Cranston round out the cast. It's the whopping list of celebrity cameos, though, that really sets this series apart from other comedies. Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Anthony Mackie and more show up in the most unexpected and hilarious ways. There's nothing else like The Studio on TV.
Apple TV Plus
Loot
Loot follows Molly Wells (played by Maya Rudolph), who, after getting divorced from her tech billionaire husband (played by Adam Scott), discovers she is $87 billion richer. Instead of living a lavish life, relishing in her newfound status, she decides to lead a philanthropic organization with the goal of giving it all away. Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Nat Faxon, Ron Funches and Joel Kim Booster also star.
Apple TV Plus
The Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy
The lack of Anthony Bourdain's presence on TV has led me to flounder for a worthy host to fill the void. I didn't expect Eugene Levy to be that guy. It's all in the title of the show. He's not a fan of traveling -- but he's taking himself out of his comfort zone and the result is an informative, heartwarming and entertaining series.
Apple TV Plus
Manhunt
We all know about Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Apple has turned that historical event into a conspiracy thriller that is well worth your time. Manhunt, which is based on the book Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer, throws us into the chase to track down John Wilkes Booth. Anthony Boyle, Tobias Menzies, Hamish Linklater, Betty Gabriel, Matt Walsh and Patton Oswalt star.
Apple TV Plus
Trying
Trying follows Nikki (Esther Smith) and Jason (Rafe Spall), a couple who can't have a baby. So, they move to adopt. But the process isn't that simple -- especially when you throw their off-beat families and daily chaos into the mix. Trying is a lot of things: A romance, a comedy, a drama. Whatever you want to call it, the Apple TV Plus series is a thoroughly enjoyable watch.
Apple TV Plus
Chief of War
Jason Momoa stars, served as writer and executive produced the period drama Chief of War. The series tells the story of the unification of the Hawaiian islands against the threat of colonization at the turn of the 18th century. The show features a predominantly Polynesian cast and explores this time in history from the indigenous perspective.
Apple TV Plus
Acapulco
Acapulco stars Eugenio Derbez as Maximo, a man reminiscing about his younger years working at a hotel in 1980s Acapulco. It's a light-hearted series that is nostalgic and full of heart, which feels like an anomaly in our current TV era. You want a bright and fun show, with low emotional stakes? This is the series for you.
Apple TV Plus
Slow Horses
Slow Horses is the first television series starring Sir Gary Oldman and that detail, in and of itself, should be enough to get you to tune in. The program is inspired by Mick Herron's Slough House book series and follows Jackson Lamb (Oldman) and his crew of low-level spies as they face espionage challenges and criminal conspiracies in each season. Three of the show's five seasons have a perfect 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, which it absolutely deserves.
Apple TV Plus
Smoke
Taron Egerton is Dave, an arson investigator, and Jurnee Smollett is Michelle, a police detective, who team up to track down a duo of arsonists wreaking havoc on their community. Smoke is a brooding drama series inspired by true events. There's a twisty mystery fueling this program, and it boasts a strong cast, which also includes Greg Kinnear, Anna Chlumsky, John Leguizamo, Rafe Spall and Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine.
Apple TV Plus
Stick
If you thought the return of Happy Gilmore was the only golf comedy worth watching, think again. Stick stars Owen Wilson as Pryce Cahill, a jaded ex-golfer who is given a second chance at the sport in the form of a 17-year-old golf prodigy named Santi (Peter Dager). If you're looking for another feel-good sports series like Ted Lasso, you should definitely give this show a shot.
Apple TV Plus
Dope Thief
Dope Thief is inspired by Dennis Tafoya's 2009 novel and follows friends Ray and Manny, who decide to impersonate DEA agents so they can steal from drug dealers. Things go sideways when their tiny crime unveils a massive drug operation. Brian Tyree Henry and Wagner Moura lead the series, ensuring this enthralling drama is led by top-tier talent.
Apple TV Plus
Your Friends & Neighbors
In this dark comedy, Jon Hamm plays defamed hedge fund manager Andrew "Coop" Cooper, who decides to try home invasions as a means of generating income. The twist on that twist? He's robbing his wealthy neighbors. What he doesn't expect through all this thievery is the dark secrets he uncovers about the members of this upper-crust community.
Apple TV Plus
Black Bird
Black Bird is inspired by the true story of Jimmy Keene (Taron Egerton), a man who made a deal with the FBI to go undercover in a maximum-security prison to shorten his sentence. I forgot to mention, this is a place that houses the criminally insane and his mission is to make friends with Larry Hall, a suspected serial killer, so he can discover information about where the bodies are buried. That is, if he can get a confession in the first place. Paul Walter Hauser gives a career-best performance as Hall.
Apple TV Plus
Pachinko
Pachinko is a sweeping drama that follows multiple generations of a Korean family from the early 1900s through the 1980s. Seriously, it's hard to sum up how beautiful and complex the storytelling is in this series in a few sentences. I'll just say the performances, cinematography and conflicts featured here are absolutely fabulous. It's probably the best show on this entire list, if I am being honest.
Apple TV Plus
Shrinking
Jason Segel, Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams star in this dramedy series about a broken therapist who strives to piece his life and family back together after a heartbreaking loss. There's an intriguing balance found when Jimmy (Segel) breaks from professional norms to help his clients heal while seeking to do the same for himself. It's sad, hilarious, poignant and profound. To me, this is what mental health stories on TV should look like.
Apple TV Plus
Bad Monkey
When you center a murder mystery in Florida, you have to expect things to get weird. And they do just that in Bad Monkey. It's a quirky sort of drama that stars Vince Vaughn as Andrew Yancy, a detective-turned-restaurant inspector, who gets sucked into a murder case after fishing a severed arm out of the ocean. Bill Lawrence (of Ted Lasso, Scrubs and Shrinking fame) created the dark comedy, which is inspired by the book by Carl Hiaasen.
Apple TV Plus
Presumed Innocent
Presumed Innocent, based on the novel by Scott Turow, hails from executive producer David E. Kelley and stars Jake Gyllenhaal as smarmy lawyer Rusty Sabich. Unlike the 1987 movie starring Harrison Ford, this series delves way deeper into the multi-layered scandal that put Sabich in handcuffs. The exploration of every character, all of whom seem awful in some way, adds to a morally corrupt narrative that makes this a riveting, albeit sometimes frustrating, watch.
Apple TV Plus
Lessons in Chemistry
Here we have yet another book adaptation to add to this list, and, thankfully, Lessons in Chemistry is a feel-good delight. Inspired by Bonnie Garmus' book of the same name, the series follows a chemist named Elizabeth Zott (Brie Larson) who finds herself taking a job as host of a cooking show. Being a story that takes place in the '50s, it shouldn't be a surprise that Zott faces loads of sexism in the workplace. She perseveres, though, and brings a quirky scientific element to her Julia Childs-like role, making this period piece a fun show to dig into.
Apple TV Plus
Platonic
I didn't know what to expect when I clicked play on Platonic. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne have co-starred in other projects together, but their delightfully oddball dynamic in this one stands out. The story follows two long-time friends who reconnect in their 40s only to find that, even though they live very different lives, they share common midlife struggles of trying to figure out where they fit in this rapidly changing world. It's also nice to see a non-romantic exploration of a friendship between a man and a woman. Contrary to what When Harry Met Sally said, it is possible.
Apple TV Plus
Bad Sisters
Sharon Horgan created this dark comedy series -- which takes inspiration from the Belgian show Clan -- about a group of sisters who deal with the fallout of the murder of JP, one of the women's husbands, who, because of his distasteful behavior, is referred to throughout the show as "The Prick." The series shifts narrative regularly to reveal bits and pieces behind who killed the man, while showcasing the dysfunctional dynamic between these bad sisters. Horgan stars opposite Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene and Eve Hewson.
