Quick tips for streaming UEFA Champions League matches using a VPN
Paris Saint-Germain begins the defence of its UEFA Champions League crown on Wednesday with a difficult Gameweek 1 home fixture at the Parc des Princes.Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching Champions League games as they happen, wherever you are in the world, and how to use a VPN if it's not available where you are. Having pulled off a historic treble last season, headlined by a 5-0 thrashing of Inter Milan in June's UCL final, Luis Enrique's PSG has a lot to live up to. While it may have missed out on an unprecedented quadruple after losing in the Club World Cup to Chelsea in July, all the signs point to the Parisians being back in the groove, having started the defence of their French Ligue 1 title with four victories from four matches.They now come up against an Atalanta team still coming to terms with life under new boss Ivan Jurić. The former Southampton manager recorded his first Serie A win of the season with a 4-1 hammering of Lecce at home at the weekend. Paris Saint-Germain takes on Atalanta at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday, Sept. 17. Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. CEST local time in France, making it an 8 p.m. BST start in the UK, a 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT kickoff in the US, and a 5 a.m. AEST start in Australia on Wednesday.
Luis Enrique saw his PSG team clock up a fourth victory of the Ligue 1 season with a 2-0 win over Lens at the weekend. Neal Simpson/Sportsphoto/Allstar/Getty ImagesLivestream PSG vs. Atalanta in the US without cableAmerican soccer fans can stream this game along with every fixture of this season's tournament via Paramount Plus, which has exclusive live English-language broadcast rights in the US for the UEFA Champions League. This season introduces a multiview option that lets fans watch up to four matches simultaneously and choose their preferred in-game audio.

How to watch every UEFA Champions League 2025-26 game online from anywhere using a VPNIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally due to incorrectly applied blackout restrictions, you may need a different way to watch the game and that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, plus it's a great idea for when you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.   With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.   Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US and Canada, as long as you've got a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.   Looking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.

Quick tips for streaming UEFA Champions League matches using a VPN  With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming UCL matches may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the "search for city or country" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is an address in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone) so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services. We normally recommend Brave.
