Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman star in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Paramount Pictures
You want cool sci-fi movies, and Prime Video has 'em.If there's one truth all science-fiction fans know, it's that there isn't just one type of sci-fi story out there. The genre is delightfully all-encompassing, featuring a cavalcade of flavors and tones to appeal to pretty much any taste. Alien thrillers and monster battles to bleak dystopian dramas and futuristic love stories can all be found here (scroll on to see what I mean). No matter what you're into, Prime Video probably has a title that fits the bill. To save you the hassle of scrolling through endless pages of content to find what you'd want to click play on, I did the work for you. Below is a guide I put together of the best sci-fi movies on the streamer. From the return of an iconic movie monster to the origin story of a terrifying (and silent) alien invasion, the choices are epic. The only challenge now is to figure out which title you're going to click play on first.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Read more: 20 of the Best Sci-Fi TV Shows to Stream on Netflix See at Prime Video
Paramount Pictures
10 Cloverfield Lane
There was a lot of secrecy around 10 Cloverfield Lane when it first hit theaters, and rightfully so. Technically, it's a sequel to Cloverfield -- the 2008 found footage giant monster movie -- but it doesn't act like it. At least not until the final act. Instead, 10 Cloverfield Lane plays out like a tight, claustrophobic thriller with solid performances by its cast, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr. The giant alien invaders are just the icing on the cake.
Paramount Pictures
Transformers
Sure, Transformers is filled with tropes that tend to come with any of Michael Bay's films but I can't ignore the childhood joy this movie sparks. The cast does a decent enough job bringing emotional stakes to the story but let's be honest: This is a Transformers movie, which means you're watching it because you want to see giant robots fight. And on that front, this movie delivers tenfold.
Push
Before Chris Evans donned the Captain America shield, he appeared in a lesser-known superhero movie: Push. The story follows a guy named Nick (Evans) who uses his psychic abilities to take down a government agency that's trying to turn folks with superpowers into super soldiers. Dakota Fanning, Camilla Bell, Ming-Na Wen and Djimon Hounsou star in this thoroughly enjoyable cult flick.

Limitless
What if there were a pill that could turn any person into a hyperintelligent super genius? Limitless aims to answer that question. The movie stars Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra, a down-on-his-luck writer who takes the untested drug and uses it to massively level up his life. Of course, what goes up must come down, and Eddie soon finds out that sometimes, it's best to leave mysterious meds alone.

Mad Max
Mad Max, the first entry in the hit franchise, takes place in a not-so-distant future where oil becomes a hard-to-find commodity. With the world in chaos, a local police officer named Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) pursues a dangerous mission to take revenge against a violent biker gang, following the murder of his wife and child.
Prime Video
The Tomorrow War
Chris Pratt stars in this action movie that follows a group of soldiers who travel back in time to warn of a future where humanity is losing the war against an army of alien invaders. Mankind's only hope lies in a group of would-be heroes who are tapped to travel to the future in order to save the present.

Molli and Max in the Future
Molli and Max in the Future is a delightfully fresh sci-fi mashup. It stars Zozia Mamet as Molli and Aristotle Athari as Max, two characters who, over the course of many years, dimensions and planets, continue running into each other. I suppose you can say it's like if When Harry Met Sally and Bladerunner had a baby. And that's meant as a compliment.
Paramount Pictures
A Quiet Place: Day One
A Quiet Place: Day One takes audiences back to the very beginning of the alien invasion. While it may not be a necessary entry in the franchise -- like, say, 10 Cloverfield Lane -- the movie digs its heels into the human experience amid an otherworldly cataclysmic disaster. Come for the disaster, stay for the cute cat.
City Films
Escape From New York
In John Carpenter's postapocalyptic cult classic, it's 1997 in New York and the city has been ravaged by war. Manhattan has been turned into a giant walled-in prison. After the president is taken hostage, former Special Forces officer (and current prisoner) Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is recruited to save the day in return for his own freedom.
Screenshot by Aaron Pruner/CNET
Donnie Darko
This mind-bending cult classic stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a misunderstood high schooler who, after seemingly surviving a horrific accident, begins traveling through time. In the process, he discovers the joy of being alive and in love. Themes of depression, repression and alternative universes fill this delightfully bizarre film. Also, let's not forget that giant demon bunny named Frank.
