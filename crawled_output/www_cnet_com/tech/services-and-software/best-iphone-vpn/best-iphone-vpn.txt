How we test
We intensively test each VPN, making sure it meets our standards for privacy, speed and usability.
What to consider
Privacy
Look for industry AES 256-bit encryption (over the OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) and ChaCha20 (with WireGuard or IKEv2). Additionally, a reliable VPN should have a kill switch, DNS leak protection and an audited no-logs policy. Privacy-critical users may appreciate a VPN provider based in privacy-friendly jurisdiction and advanced features like obfuscated servers, Tor-over-VPN, multi-hop connections and RAM-only server infrastructure.
Speed
All VPNs slow down your internet connection somewhat but the fastest VPNs only reduce your internet download speeds by an average of 25% or less. The best-performing VPNs we benchmarked only dropped our speeds by less than 20%.
Usability
A solid VPN for iPhone should be simple to use, whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned tech user, so that you can easily hop on a server and access different settings.
Device support
In addition to iOS and iPadOS, you may want to consider other devices you want to use a VPN on. Most quality VPN providers also support Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android/Android TV. VPN support for Apple TV is becoming increasingly common. Some VPNs offer Linux GUI apps, which are easier to use than CLI apps for new Linux users. And many VPNs also offer router support for whole-network coverage that lets you use the service with devices that don't have native VPN apps, like game consoles.
Cost
VPN pricing varies but you can expect to pay anywhere from $5 to $15 per month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. You can usually save money by choosing an annual rather than monthly subscription, with prices ranging from $30 to $100 per year. While multi-year bundles often offer the most savings, we typically recommend sticking with an annual plan for the most savings and the least risk.

Why we like it If you’re looking for a cheaper alternative to high-priced VPNs like ExpressVPN and NordVPN, but still want a premium VPN experience, Surfshark is a great choice. Surfshark’s iOS app is slick, packed with useful privacy features and works just as well as its expensive peers. The app connects in a snap and settings are easily accessible with just a few taps. All in all, it’s a top-notch VPN for iPhone that’s fast, user-friendly and excellent for streaming when you’re on the go.Why we like itLike many other VPNs, Surfshark’s iOS app offers standard features like a kill switch, quick-connect and protocol selection (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2). Like other top VPNs, Surfshark includes standard privacy protections like an audited no-logs policy and DNS leak protection. But Surfshark’s iPhone app includes a few extras like an ad blocker, static IP, Rotating IP that automatically changes your IP address every few minutes and Dynamic Multihop, which allows you to tunnel through any two server locations of your choosing. Notably, Surfshark also offers split-tunneling on its iOS app, a feature that most other VPNs no longer offer for Apple devices. We also like that Surfshark gives you the option to pause your connection instead of disconnecting outright, which can be helpful if you need to take care of a few things while off the VPN but don’t want to forget to turn it back on when you want to protect your privacy. But what really sets Surfshark apart from the competition is its Alternative ID feature that lets you generate a fake persona that includes a full name, physical address and email address that you can use to fill out forms and sign up for stuff online without having to use your actual personal information. Alternative ID features are included with all subscription plans, but an Alternative Number feature is also available for an extra $3 per month, letting you receive calls and communicate via text without having to divulge your actual phone number.

Surfshark isn’t the fastest VPN, but it’s still relatively speedy and plenty fast enough for general online browsing, as well as more data-heavy activities like streaming and gaming on your iPhone. In our 2025 speed tests, we calculated a total average speed loss of 21%, which is slower than NordVPN’s astounding 3% speed loss but more in line with Proton VPN’s 16% speed loss and ExpressVPN’s 18%. Either way, if your network connection is fast enough to begin with, Surfshark’s speeds still shouldn’t noticeably impact your online activity.In our streaming tests, Surfshark performed exceptionally well on iOS, unblocking content on popular streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Hulu, Netflix and HBO Max -- through various global server locations. And with a massive network of over 3,000 servers in 100 different countries, Surfshark can help give you access to a vast amount of international streaming content on your iPhone whether you’re at home or traveling the world. Surfshark's long-term plans offer a lot of value when compared with ExpressVPN's and NordVPN's pricing, especially considering Surfshark's unlimited simultaneous connection allowance. The annual plan costs $48 for the first year, and the two-year plan costs $60 total for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $79 annually). However, Surfshark's monthly subscription costs $15.45 per month, which is more expensive than just about any other VPN's monthly rate, so for the best value, we recommend sticking with an annual plan. All subscription plans are backed by a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you're not satisfied with the service.Also nominated in: Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video, Best VPN for Netflix

Why we like it ExpressVPN is the best iPhone VPN for beginners because its iOS app is a breeze to use and because the service delivers industry-leading privacy protections, fast speeds and excellent streaming capabilities. The app's minimalist interface is simple to navigate and includes all the basic features you'd want in a VPN app, like a kill switch, protocol selection (Lightway, IKEv2) and easy access to servers. You'll also have access to Advanced Protection features that you can set to block ads, malware, trackers and adult sites. Additional tools you'll have on hand include a DNS leak test, WebRTC leak test and IP address checker -- which make it easy to ensure the VPN is working properly when you're on the go. In July 2025, ExpressVPN revealed that it now offers servers in all 50 of the United States, making it a great choice for traveling to and within the US, or streaming regional sports, like NFL and NBA games.Why we like itIf you want to stream your favorite shows and movies on your iPhone, ExpressVPN is an excellent option. The 18% average speed loss we measured in our most recent speed tests means ExpressVPN should be plenty fast for streaming and other data-heavy online activities. During our latest tests with ExpressVPN's iOS app, we were able to access content on popular streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Hulu, Netflix and HBO Max.Privacy-focused folks will appreciate ExpressVPN’s forward-thinking privacy initiatives and its strong commitment to transparency. Its post-quantum protections help protect your data from future threats from quantum computers and are built into the Lightway protocol -- so you don’t have to do anything other than connect through Lightway to benefit from post-quantum protections. ShuffleIP is another privacy feature that changes your IP address for every website you visit, making it even more difficult to track you online when using the service. Like ExpressVPN’s post-quantum protections, ShuffleIP works in the background so you don’t need to enable it separately. During our latest tests, the kill switch worked as expected on iOS and we detected no leaks. ExpressVPN's no-logs policy is regularly audited, offering additional peace of mind.

With ExpressVPN, you'll get the best overall VPN and one of the best iPhone VPNs you can buy. If you’ve got other devices to connect, ExpressVPN lets you link up to eight simultaneously. But with its premium service comes a premium price tag -- one that far outpaces most of the competition. The monthly plan costs $13 per month, which is in the same ballpark as what most VPNs charge per month. But ExpressVPN's longer-term plans are considerably more expensive than many of its competitors, including Surfshark, Proton VPN, NordVPN and Mullvad. The yearly plan costs $100 for the first year and the two-year plan costs $140 for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $117 annually). The yearly and two-year plans include additional identity protection features, which you're essentially forced to pay extra for even if you don't want or need them. However, company representatives tell us that ExpressVPN is working on overhauling its pricing structure to offer more value for budget-conscious users. ExpressVPN offers a seven-day free trial in addition to a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can give the service a try before committing.Also nominated in: Best VPN for Apple TV, Best VPNs for Streaming

Why we like it NordVPN is the fastest VPN for iPhones, making it an excellent choice for bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming videos, gaming or hopping on Zoom calls. Its astounding 3% speed loss in our 2025 tests was significantly faster than the rest of the pack. Across the board, from its iOS and iPadOS to MacOS, Windows and Android apps, NordVPN is user-friendly, with a familiar app experience regardless of the platform. In our testing, NordVPN’s iPhone app was slick and intuitive, with easy access to settings like protocol selection (OpenVPN and NordLynx), server selection, specialty servers and Threat Protection. Why we like itIts generous global network of 8,000-plus servers across 126 countries makes NordVPN a solid choice for international travel and streaming service unblocking. We effortlessly unblocked content on many streaming apps, including Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Netflix and BBC iPlayer. Its blazing-fast server speeds make it one of the best VPNs for streaming. While Nord’s superb entertainment support is great for casual VPN users seeking basic privacy or streaming content unblocking, its robust privacy chops make it a compelling choice for folks with serious privacy needs, like concerned torrenters. Its proprietary NordWhisper VPN protocol is designed to mimic standard web traffic, and therefore may slip through school Wi-Fi firewalls and other networks that restrict VPN use. Specialty servers like Tor Over VPN and double hop beef up your privacy, making it even more difficult to trace your web traffic back to your device. And Meshnet is a unique privacy feature that lets you create a virtual network to host remote LAN parties for gaming, seamlessly access streaming services while traveling or avoid CAPTCHAs. NordVPN also includes a strict no-logs policy that's been independently audited, along with DNS leak protection.

At $13 a month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years, NordVPN is competitively priced, considering its rich privacy feature set and generous 10 simultaneous connection allowance. But the one- and two-year plans rise to an astronomical $140 per year, which is borderline extortionate. You can avoid a pricey auto-renewal by stacking subscriptions, but we’d prefer a more budget-friendly renewal price. But if you want blisteringly fast connectivity, NordVPN is a fantastic choice for streaming on your iPhone, iPad, MacBook or Apple TV. Your purchase is backed by an industry-standard 30-day money-back guarantee.Also nominated in: Fastest VPNs, Best VPNs for Netflix

Why we like it Proton VPN is the best (and only) free VPN that we recommend for iPhone or any other platform. But Proton’s exceptional premium VPN plan is a worthy upgrade -- or alternative to other paid VPN rivals. We particularly like the option to create custom server group profiles and easy access to settings like protocol selection (WireGuard, Stealth), kill switch, NetShield and VPN Accelerator. Why we like itProton VPN's free plan doesn’t sell your user data, limit your monthly use or plaster your screen with ads. But you can’t select a server manually, you’re limited to servers in five countries, and you can only connect on one device at a time. By comparison, its paid plan provides 14,900-plus servers in 122 countries, lets you jump on any server you want and allows for up to 10 simultaneous connections, which is excellent for multi-device users.Where Proton VPN excels is its balance of remaining privacy-forward but great for casual VPN users. It’s fast, outstanding for streaming and prioritizes privacy. The iOS home screen was redesigned in April 2025, making it more user-friendly and easier to access favorite server locations or customize settings. You’ll get some unique privacy features, like its proprietary Stealth VPN protocol that’s designed to bypass VPN blocks. Android users can access guest mode to use Proton VPN without creating an account, and the company said that feature is coming to iOS and iPadOS in 2025. Proton VPN also has an independently audited no-logs policy and DNS leak protection.

During our tests, Proton unblocked nearly every streaming service we tried, including some tough-to-access ones, like Egypt Netflix libraries -- ExpressVPN and Surfshark were the only other VPNs we tested that were able to load Netflix Egypt. Whether you want to boost your privacy, need to stream geo-protected content or want a generous global server network for travel, Proton VPN is a great choice. While some VPNs like ExpressVPN are slightly more user-friendly, and others like Mullvad may be marginally more private, it’s hard to find a VPN that balances intuitive app design with streaming unblocking as well as Proton does.Proton VPN costs $10 per month, $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years combined (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually). Priced in the middle of the value-packed Surfshark and the premium ExpressVPN, Proton VPN is a solid overall investment that provides fast speeds, unique and useful privacy amenities plus excellent streaming service unblocking capabilities. All plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee.Also nominated in: Best Free VPN, Best VPN for Amazon Prime Video

The best VPNs for iPhones in 2025
Screenshot/CNETSurfshark is the best VPN for iPhones overall. We appreciate that Surfshark offers split tunneling on iOS and MacOS, not just on Windows and Android -- a rarity among VPN providers. Despite its relatively wallet-friendly pricing, Surfshark doesn't compromise on features, including advanced privacy settings or speed. You can use Surfshark on as many devices as you want simultaneously, which is great if you have a household full of devices you want to protect, and more generous than most competitors.
Surfshark's app delivers tons of features at a budget-friendly price. Surfshark/Screenshot by CNETExpressVPN is the best iPhone VPN for beginners, thanks to its excellent privacy protection and streamlined, user-friendly mobile interface on iOS and iPadOS (as well as Android and all other platforms for that matter). In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that its server network included connection options in all 50 of the United States, making it a great choice for travel and for unblocking regional sports, like NFL or WNBA games. It's a great overall VPN, although you'll pay more for that excellence -- ExpressVPN is more expensive than most of its rivals.
Screenshot/CNETNordVPN is the fastest VPN for iPhones, delivering blazing-fast speeds perfect for 4K video streaming or online mobile gaming. Its fast server speeds, coupled with an impressive global roster of 8,000-plus servers in 126 countries, make NordVPN one of the best iPhone VPNs for streaming and travel.
NordVPN offers servers in more locations than most VPNs. NordVPN/Screenshot by CNETProton VPN is the most versatile iPhone VPN, offering an impressive server network alongside customizable settings and features that are great for power users. Proton is privacy-focused and open-source, and it performed well in our latest speed tests, trailing only NordVPN.The Best iPhone VPNs compared

A virtual private network, or VPN, enhances your iPhone's privacy by masking your public IP address, so your ISP or mobile carrier can't see what websites you visit or apps you use. Likewise, apps and websites you use won't be able to tell where you're actually connecting from because your public IP address -- which is like a street address -- is hidden, meaning you can appear like you're in another city, state or even country.Because VPNs can make apps think you're in a different geographical area, you can unblock region-restricted content, such as foreign Netflix libraries or global Amazon Prime Video content. Using a VPN, you can watch Wednesday on Netflix from anywhere around the world, stream Murdoch Mysteries on CBC Gem from outside Canada and unblock regional sports streaming content, like NFL or WNBA games. If your mobile carrier throttles video streaming on a cellular connection, you may even experience faster speeds and therefore better streaming video quality on your phone using a VPN.Our team of experts at CNET has rigorously tested dozens of the top VPN providers on multiple platforms, including iOS and iPadOS. We evaluated each service based on several factors, including privacy features, internet speed loss, user-friendly app design, streaming service content unblocking and overall value for the money. Whether you want to avoid streaming video throttling on a cellular connection, need to unblock geographically restricted streaming movies and shows or are traveling internationally for the summer but need access to content from your home country without grappling with annoying CAPTCHAs, one of the best iPhone VPNs is a great addition to your app arsenal.

Factors to consider in the best iPhone VPNs
Downloading a VPN app, creating an account, choosing a plan and connecting to your VPN shouldn't take longer than a minute or so. Nelson Aguilar/CNETWith so many iPhone VPN apps available, it can be difficult to choose the right one. Based on our extensive research and hands-on testing of VPNs over the years, these are the factors to look out for when choosing the best VPN for iPhone:PrivacyThe most important factor to consider with any VPN is privacy. You should never use a VPN provider if you can’t trust that it's taking your privacy seriously. Every VPN worth its salt should provide AES 256-bit encryption over either OpenVPN or IKEv2 VPN protocols at the bare minimum. If it also offers ChaCha20 over WireGuard, you’ll get all the protection you expect plus a nice speed boost over most other protocols. Your VPN should also have basic privacy features such as a kill switch, which protects you if your VPN connection unexpectedly goes down, DNS leak protection to stop your ISP from reading your website requests and a solid no-logs policy that is regularly audited. We recommend checking any provider’s privacy policy and reading its audit reports closely, as it’ll give you a good understanding of whether a VPN provider is serious about your privacy. If you notice a mention of data collection or sharing practices in a VPN's privacy policy that don't sit well with you, then it's best to trust your gut and look for a different provider.If your privacy needs are critical, then you’ll need to look for a provider that goes above and beyond the standard privacy considerations. Your VPN should be based in a jurisdiction that has strong privacy laws that don't mandate data retention or logging. Choosing a provider that offers obfuscation is also necessary if you’re in a region or network that restricts or bans VPN use outright because it can help hide the fact that you're using a VPN in the first place. Many of the best VPNs are also rolling out post-quantum protections that help protect against potential future threats from quantum computers, which is essential for privacy-critical users now and in the future. Finally, your provider should offer either a RAM-only server infrastructure or employ full-disk encryption on its hard drives, both of which can help ensure that your data remains secure. There are also some other privacy features that aren’t as vital but still useful, such as ad-blockers, Tor over VPN and multihop connections. Speed Your VPN's connection speeds can have a major influence on the quality of your streaming, downloading, video conferencing, gaming and general web-browsing activities. All VPNs slow down your internet somewhat, simply by nature of encrypting your traffic and routing it through one or more remote servers. To keep things running as smoothly as possible, you'll want a VPN that will have as minimal an impact on your regular internet speeds as possible. Generally, we've found that the best VPNs for iPhone only drop your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less. In our testing, we've seen as low as an average 3% internet download speed loss. For bandwidth-demanding applications like competitive gaming or video streaming, you'll want a fast VPN.

UsabilityA good VPN for iPhone should run smoothly and be easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise. It should have all of the features you need easily accessible with a tap of your finger. Many of the best iPhone VPN apps also include an easy way to get in touch with support directly from the device, which can be helpful if you need assistance on the go. Basically, your VPN app should be as easy for you to use as your iPhone itself. It should have a large network of servers around the world so you can connect easily and reliably from wherever you may be traveling and be able to help you access geo-restricted content from various regions. Server networkThink about the cities, states and countries you travel to the most, or want to make it look like you're connecting from. Most of our top-rated VPNs feature thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. Large server networks benefit travel, since you can find a server near where you are for the fastest-possible connection -- usually, the closer you are physically to a VPN server, the less speed loss you'll experience. Additionally, a generous VPN server network is great for streaming-service unblocking and bypassing regional content blocks, since you've got a better chance of finding servers in countries you need to make it look like you're in. Plus, more servers may help maintain better internet speeds, because servers overloaded with users may slow down.Alongside the total number of servers and countries, think about specialty servers. Some VPN providers, including ExpressVPN, let you torrent on any servers, whereas other VPN providers, like NordVPN and Proton VPN, have P2P servers optimized for peer-to-peer file-sharing. Certain VPN providers offer servers with beefed-up privacy. For instance, you might find a double VPN, or multihop, VPN servers that feature a second VPN connection to make it even more difficult to trace your web traffic back to its source (your device). Likewise, some VPN companies have Tor over VPN, or Onion over VPN servers, which make it harder to trace your internet traffic back to its source (again, your device). Tor over VPN and double VPN servers tout similar benefits, with the main difference being that multihop relies on a pair of VPN connections, while onion VPN uses a combination of Tor and a VPN connection simultaneously.
Streaming service unblockingThere are many reasons to use a VPN, from privacy for web browsing to travel. Because VPNs route your web traffic through encrypted servers, apps you use and websites you visit will think you're in a different location, which is based on the server you're tunneling through. For instance, if you're in New York City but connected to a server in the UK, apps like Netflix will think you're across the pond. Many streaming services, like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer and CBC Gem, rely on your IP address to load content. Depending on your IP address, which contains general geographical information, the content library might vary a lot or you may not be able to access anything at all. But with a VPN, you can bypass regional restrictions to unblock content on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services. Using a VPN for streaming could even help you save money. CostDepending on your budget, you may want to take into account the cost and overall value of your iPhone VPN before making a purchase. VPN pricing can vary greatly from provider to provider but you can typically expect to spend about $5 to $15 per month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. If you want to save some money, you can choose an annual subscription, where prices can range from roughly $30 to $100 per year. You'll want to be careful with free VPNs because you may end up risking your privacy instead of protecting it. Many free VPNs have slow speeds or have unreliable connections that frequently drop because of overloaded servers. Some even actively degrade your privacy, logging any internet activity through the VPN for sale to third parties or injecting ads into your browsing sessions. Even paid VPNs have varying degrees of usability, privacy protections, speeds and streaming capabilities. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET recommends. Most premium VPNs offer a money-back guarantee anywhere from a week to 45 days. You can also get a seven-day free trial with many VPNs when you sign up through Apple's App Store, so you have options to try various iPhone VPNs risk-free before you decide whether to fully invest in one. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription. Device supportWhile you'll want a VPN for iPhone that works well on iOS, you may have other devices that you want to run a VPN on. Most VPNs work on Windows, MacOS, Linux PCs and Android devices. While Android TV and Fire TV apps are common for use on streaming devices, Apple TV apps are still on the rise. Providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN, Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish offer Apple TV VPN apps. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Think about the devices you want to install a VPN app on and make sure your desired VPN provider supports those gadgets.

James Martin/CNET How we test iPhone VPNs
PIA's apps offer a lot of options for customization. PIA/Screenshot by CNETWhen we evaluate the best iPhone VPNs, we spend weeks testing the features offered on each VPN's iPhone app to see how they compare to the competition. We carefully consider the look and feel of the app and the overall usability of the software, including how easy it is to establish a connection, bearing in mind the generally smooth user experience iPhone users are accustomed to. We test the performance and reliability of the VPN connection on each of the protocols available in the provider's iPhone app, while paying special attention to how the app performs when switching between Wi-Fi and a mobile network. We test for leaks and ensure each service's kill switch is working as it should, in addition to testing the functionality of every other feature available on the VPN's iPhone app. If a provider offers unique features (or includes a rare-to-iPhone feature like split-tunneling) we make sure to call them out and document our experience using them. Many VPNs also offer easy access to customer support directly from their iPhone app, so we test that functionality and evaluate how seamlessly the app is able to connect the user with a support agent as well as the general effectiveness of the support itself. We test each VPN's ability to circumvent geographical restrictions and access content on popular streaming sites on the iPhone, while taking into account previously-tested speed performance and noting any issues with buffering or stream quality. Finally, we evaluate each provider's pricing to determine the service's overall value.

Other iPhone VPNs we tested
PIAPrivate Internet Access is a decent cheap VPN that undercuts most of its rivals at $12 per month, $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 every three years. We like its customizable apps and privacy-forward design that includes open-source apps as well as a reader-friendly privacy policy. PIA is one of the few VPN providers that offers split tunneling on MacOS, so Apple aficionados may appreciate the flexibility to route some apps but not others through a VPN. However, PIA’s high 48% average speed loss is about double what you can typically expect from a fast VPN, making it a tough sell for folks with slow or unreliable internet connections. Additionally, we experienced many CAPTCHAs with PIA when trying to access websites like Google. And its app design, while mostly user-friendly, felt outdated compared to most of the competition. While PIA is a good budget VPN, for a little bit more money, you can get a lot more value with a VPN like Surfshark or Proton VPN.Read our PIA review.IPVanishIPVanish's iPhone app is fairly easy to use and includes a prominent "Connect" button on the home screen that'll get you connected quickly. If you navigate to the "locations" screen to select a specific server, you can either connect to the "optimal location" or choose from a list of servers. However, after you've connected, there's no indication of whether you're connected or not unless you navigate back to the home screen. Even if you connect to the optimal location, the Connect button on the locations screen still says "Connect" -- which can lead to some confusion. Although IPVanish's iPhone app isn't as streamlined as the others on this list, it includes split tunneling functionality -- a feature most VPNs don't offer with their iPhone apps. Even so, it's difficult to enthusiastically recommend IPVanish to iPhone users considering that far superior services are available for the same price or cheaper. IPVanish costs $13 per month, $40 for the first year or $53 for the first two years combined. However (as this information is not made sufficiently clear on IPVanish's pricing page), be advised that the price of the annual plan more than doubles to $156 a year on the annual plan, and $312 total for two years of service on the two-year tier after the initial term. Also, IPVanish's 30-day money-back guarantee only applies to the annual and two-year subscription plans, not the monthly plan. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by CNET's parent company, Ziff Davis.)  Read our IPVanish review.

What is the best free VPN for iPhone?
The only free VPN for iPhone that we recommend is Proton VPN. Its free tier employs the same encryption standards as its premium tier, doesn't impose any use or speed limitations and doesn't sell your data. There's no shortage of free VPN options available for iPhone, but we generally don't recommend most free VPNs for a number of reasons. First, many free VPNs make money by collecting your personal data and selling it to third parties -- putting your privacy at risk and defeating the purpose of using a VPN in the first place. Many free VPNs may also inundate you with annoying pop-ups and unwanted advertisements, and some may even contain malware. Additionally, free VPNs impose limitations on use, are burdened by overcrowded servers (which can negatively affect speeds and stability), typically lack streaming support and often employ substandard encryption.

What is the best VPN if I only care about streaming?
In our testing, ExpressVPN was the VPN that performed the best for streaming on iPhone as well as on every other device we tested. If your main priority is to unblock international streaming content on your iPhone with a VPN, we recommend going with ExpressVPN because it has proven year after year in our tests to be the most reliable service for geo-unblocking content from all over the world.

What to look forward to in 2025
The best VPNs for iPhone are already highly intuitive and deliver exceptional performance on iOS devices. But you can expect even more refinements throughout 2025 and beyond in terms of performance and features. Specifically, many of the top VPNs have been rolling out additional services such as password managers, antivirus protection, secure email and identity protection features that you can bundle with the VPN service. We've started seeing many of these additional features added to existing VPN apps but we're likely to see them integrated more into a single app for each provider instead of having multiple apps for each of your bundled services. We're also likely to see a greater degree of parity between apps on different platforms (especially with more providers re-implementing split tunneling on iPhone and other Apple apps), so users can have access to the same set of features regardless of which operating system they're using. Additionally, we'll see providers committing to more regular audits, refining their pricing structures and a wider implementation of forward-thinking privacy features such as post-quantum protection.In June 2025, ExpressVPN revealed the completion of a successful audit performed by KPMG LLP, which found no evidence of logging. Proton announced a successful SOC Type II audit in July 2025, which confirmed that the company has strong security in place and moreover, reliably follows that practice. Surfshark revealed in June 2025 that it underwent an audit by Deloitte that found no evidence of logging practices. In February 2025, NordVPN announced that Deloitte audited its no-logging claims, finding no evidence of logging. The company released the results of a successful app assessment handled by Cure53, which concluded that NordVPN had strong VPN features that work as intended.

Do iPhones come with a built-in VPN?
No, iPhones do not have a built-in VPN app, but there is a built-in VPN client in iOS that lets you connect to a VPN server. But the easiest way to use a VPN on your iPhone or iPad is by downloading your VPN provider's app.

Do iPhone VPNs leak traffic?
Recent independent research claims that VPNs on iOS devices leak user traffic outside of the VPN tunnel, unencrypted. VPN providers have pointed out that the vulnerability exists on Apple’s side and affects all VPNs on iOS devices. Proton VPN outlined a workaround to the issue in a blog post, advising iOS VPN users to connect to a VPN server, enable Airplane mode (to kill existing internet connections and temporarily disable the VPN) and disable Airplane mode. The VPN should then reconnect with all internet connections running through the VPN tunnel. Proton notes that it’s not a 100% guarantee that the VPN will be rendered leak-free through this process, but it can only help.

What does my ISP/mobile carrier see when I'm connected to my VPN?
Your internet service provider or mobile carrier can see that you're connected to a VPN, but it won’t be able to see the websites you visit or your browsing history, because your iPhone VPN encrypts your online traffic. Your ISP/mobile carrier will also see things like the IP address of the VPN server you're connected to, the time stamps of when you're connected and the amount of data you've transmitted. If you want to hide the fact that you’re using a VPN altogether, you can connect to an obfuscated server, if offered by your VPN.

How do I set up a VPN on my iPhone?
The easiest way to set up a VPN on your iPhone is by downloading your VPN provider's app from Apple's App Store. Then, fire up the app, punch in your login credentials and tap "Connect" or "On" -- the exact phrasing may differ -- to enable your VPN. To turn off a VPN on your iPhone, tap the "Disconnect" or "Off" button.

Can I use my VPN on multiple devices besides my iPhone?
Yes, the best VPNs for iPhone all allow for multiple simultaneous connections, which is great if you want to use a VPN on other devices -- like a MacBook, Windows PC, Android device smart TV or streaming device. Typically, you'll be able to connect at least five to 10 simultaneous devices, with a few services offering unlimited connections.
