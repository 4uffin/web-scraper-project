New, non-Adobe AI models are coming to Photoshop beta. Adobe
Photoshop is getting its first-ever non-Adobe AI models, starting with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (better known by its nickname, nano banana) and Flux.1 Kontext Pro. These new, third-party models give creators who use the generative fill tool more options for AI media generation without having to leave their current project. They're only available in the Photoshop beta app starting today, but many beta features eventually make their way into the regular version of Photoshop.Anyone who has used AI knows it makes mistakes, called hallucinations. By using AI image generation in the Photoshop app, the tools necessary for fixing those mistakes are right at hand."You have the full power of Photoshop around you. So as you use generative fill with these [new] choices, you can also continue to refine your results using the powerful engine that is Photoshop: layers, masks, selections," Deepa Subramaniam, vice president of creative professionals marketing for Adobe, said in an interview. "So it's really about how all of this comes together within Photoshop."This is also good news for Adobe subscribers who want to play around with the AI darling du jour, Google's nano banana. This new image editing model has drawn plenty of attention and excitement, and it's already available in other Adobe programs, including Express and Firefly, as well as Google's AI Studio.
Standard subscribers (those on the Creative Cloud standard, photography plan and Photoshop desktop single app plan) will get 100 lifetime generation credits for each model, while Creative Cloud Pro subscribers get 500 credits per day for each model. But from now until Oct. 28, you can use the models without deducting credits.Right now, you can only select outside models when using generative fill, though Subramaniam said there are plans to bring outside models to other AI tools in the future. Generative fill lets users select specific areas and use text prompts for AI to "fill" the area with AI-generated imagery. Outside AI models fall under Adobe's AI policy, which promises not to train on your content. The company does warn that third-party material may not be OK for commercial use, unlike content made with its in-house Firefly models.When you go to select those regions, you can swap out Adobe Firefly's image model for Gemini or Flux. You can confine changes to select areas with your select tool, something that's hard to do with other AI image generation tools. You can also take the opposite approach by selecting the entire project and using text prompts to have Gemini or Flux reimagine it, with your existing assets serving as reference images.
An example of how you can use generative fill to reimagine existing images. AdobePhotoshop has added many AI tools over the past few years, to the chagrin of some users. I've tested those features extensively as CNET's AI image and video expert. Adobe has long offered image generation through its Firefly AI models, integrated into Photoshop and other programs. But Photoshop's AI updates have mostly focused on editing rather than wholesale creation. Generative remove is an AI heavy-duty eraser, for example. You can check out this guide to using Photoshop's AI tools for more tips.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.AI models available through AdobeAdobe has been expanding its roster of third-party AI models over the past few months.
