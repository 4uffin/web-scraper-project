Google's ChromeOS Will Combine With Android Next Year to Supercharge Big-Screen AI
The success of Gemini and AI on Android has inspired the major update to ChromeOS, Android chief Sameer Samat says at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii.
Katie Collins Principal Writer Katie is a UK-based news reporter and features writer. Officially, she is CNET's European correspondent, covering tech policy and Big Tech in the EU and UK. Unofficially, she serves as CNET's Taylor Swift correspondent. You can also find her writing about tech for good, ethics and human rights, the climate crisis, robots, travel and digital culture. She was once described a "living synth" by London's Evening Standard for having a microchip injected into her hand.

Sameer Samat on stage at Snapdragon Summit. David Lumb/CNET
Bringing AI to smartphones and tablets has been a massive success for Google, which earlier this month saw its AI assistant Gemini become the top free app on Apple's App Store for the first time. More specifically, AI and Gemini have become integral parts of the past few major Android updates and are super-well integrated into the Android ecosystem.For now, the same can't be said of ChromeOS, Google's lightweight operating system for computers and laptops. But that's all set to change.Earlier this year, Android chief Sameer Samat confirmed that ChromeOS and Android would combine to create a more seamless experience across devices. Speaking at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii on Wednesday, Samat said it's one of the things he's "super excited about for next year" and gave a bunch of additional details about the how and why behind the move."For a long time, mobile phones and PCs have been communicating... now we have this opportunity with large-screen compute to add that in," he said. "In the Android ecosystem, you have all these different devices, and you want your AI to be able to work across all of them. So that's the new era."That doesn't mean ChromeOS is going away, though. "If you think about the laptop form factor, we've had ChromeOS for a long time, and we're super committed to that platform, and it's been really successful for us," Samat said. In fact, the ChromeOS experience will remain, but its the baseline technology will switch to running on Android, he added.Speaking on Tuesday at the Snapdragon Summit, Google's SVP of Devices and Services, Rick Osterloh, shed some more light on the technicalities of the project. "We're building together a technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems," he said. "This is another way that we can leverage all of the great work we're doing together on our AI stack, our full stack, bringing Gemini models, bringing the assistant, bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain."It will be fascinating to see what new experiences Gemini will enable on ChromeOS, and how it might elevate Google's big-screen OS for this new era. Google will be hoping it can replicate the success of its AI-based mobile operating system across its laptops and make its Chromebooks even more appealing to Android phone owners looking to upgrade their computers, thanks to the seamless integration of Gemini across their different devices.
