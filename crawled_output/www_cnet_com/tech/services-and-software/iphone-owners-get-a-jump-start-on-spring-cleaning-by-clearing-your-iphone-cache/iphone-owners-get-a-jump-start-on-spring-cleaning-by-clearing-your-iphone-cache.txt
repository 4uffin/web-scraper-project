You can easily clear the cache in your Safari, Chrome or Firefox browser in four or five steps. James Martin/CNET
Apple gave us an early look at iOS 26 at its June WWDC event, released a public beta in July for early adopters, and is expected to show more of the newest update to the iPhone operating system at its "awe dropping" iPhone event Tuesday, Sept. 9. But there's a way right now to give your iPhone a new lease on life -- clear your cache.
Clearing your cache gives Safari and other web browsers a clean slate. It can improve performance, free up a bit of storage space and help fix annoying bugs like slow page loads or broken links. It's not an entire system overhaul, and it can't save you from a seven-year-old phone, but it can help improve your browser experience.
Your browser cache is kind of like a digital mini fridge. Whether you use Chrome, Safari, Firefox or another browser, the cache stores page elements locally to speed up your next visit. It's great for grabbing a digital snack or drink without having to trek all the way to the kitchen -- at least, until the mini fridge gets overstocked with expired food, which in this analogy is outdated page elements.
Clearing your cache is the equivalent of cleaning out that mini fridge. You'll have to restock it (your first visit after you clear your iPhone cache might be a bit slower), but once you do, you'll have a better experience than before.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.If it's been a while since you gave your iPhone's browser a reset, here's how to clear your cache and give your device a quick refresh.
What happens when you clear your cache?
Clearing your cache usually involves clearing website cookies too. Cookies work similarly to browser caches, except they store information about user data, rather than data on the website itself. Clearing your cookies gives you a chance to reset those preferences, which could improve your browsing experience. Note that clearing your cache and cookies will log you out of sites, which means you'll have to log into them again and reset any preferences. The up-front investment of that time can lead to a smoother experience down the road and it can be a useful fix if you've recently changed settings that aren't being applied properly.
Here are step-by-step guides on how to clear your iPhone's cache, depending on the browser you prefer.
How to clear your iPhone cache in Safari
Safari is the default browser on iPhones and you can clear your Safari cache in a few short steps. Starting with iOS 11, following this process will affect all devices signed in to your iCloud account. As a result, all of your devices' caches will be cleared and you'll need to sign in to everything the next time you use them. Here's what to do.
1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone.
2. Select Apps > Safari.
3. Scroll down to History and Website Data and choose Clear History and Website Data.4. Choose Clear History and Data in the pop-up box -- you can choose anywhere from the last hour to all history.
Then you're set!

How to clear your iPhone cache in Chrome
Chrome is another popular browser for iPhone users. Google has simplified the process for clearing your Chrome cache, making it much faster to clear your data.
1. Open the Chrome app.
2. Select the three dots in the bottom right to open more options.
3. Swipe over to Settings in the top menu bar.
4. Scroll down and tap Privacy and security.
5. Tap Delete browsing data to open another menu. Select the intended time range at the top of the menu (anywhere from Last 15 minutes to All time). Make sure that Cookies and Site Data are checked, along with Cached Images and Files. Finally, hit Delete data at the bottom of the screen.
Screenshot by Adam Benjamin/CNET
How to clear your iPhone cache in Firefox
If you're a Firefox devotee, don't worry. Clearing the cache on your iPhone is straightforward. Just follow these steps.
1. Press the hamburger menu in the bottom right corner to open options.
2. Choose Settings at the bottom of the menu.
3. Select Data Management in the Privacy section.
4. To clear everything, choose Web Site Data at the top of the menu and then Clear All Web Site Data. Alternatively, you can choose to clear just your browsing history, cache, cookies, offline web data, tracking protection or offline files.
Screenshot by Adam Benjamin/CNET
How often do I need to clear my cache?
Most people only need to clear their caches once every month or two. That's generally the point when your browser will build up a cache large enough to start slowing things down. If you frequent a large number of sites, you should err on the side of clearing your cache more often.
