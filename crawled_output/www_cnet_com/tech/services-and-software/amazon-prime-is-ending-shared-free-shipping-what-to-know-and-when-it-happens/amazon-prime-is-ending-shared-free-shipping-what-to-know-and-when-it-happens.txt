Amazon Prime Is Ending Shared Free Shipping Outside Your Home, Gifts Excluded
Here's how the end of the Prime Invitee program could affect your free deliveries.
Tyler Graham Writer Tyler is a writer under CNET's home energy and utilities category. He came to CNET straight out of college, where he graduated from Seton Hall with a bachelor's degree in journalism. For the past seven months, Tyler has attended a White House press conference, participated in energy product testing at CNET's testing labs in Louisville, Kentucky, and written one of CNET Energy's top-performing news articles, on federal solar policy. Not bad for a newbie.
When Tyler's not asking questions or doing research for his next assignment, you can find him in his home state of New Jersey, kicking back with a bagel and watching an action flick or playing a new video game.
You can reach him at tgraham@cnet.com. Expertise Community solar, state solar policy, solar cost and accessibility, renewable energy, electric vehicles, video games, home internet for gaming.

If you're a Prime Invitee, your free deliveries may be coming to an end soon. James Martin/CNET
If you've been using someone else's Amazon Prime membership for free shipping, but you don't live in the same house, you may need to pay another subscription fee soon. According to Amazon's updated customer service page, the online retail giant is ending its Prime Invitee benefit-sharing program Oct. 1.Amazon's Prime Invitee program is being replaced by Amazon Family. It includes many of the same benefits, but Amazon Family only works for up to two adults and four children living in the same "primary residential address" -- a shared home. Amazon Family members will still be able to use free shipping to send gifts elsewhere, but your Prime Invitees will no longer be able to use the perk.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Amazon isn't the first company to prevent membership sharing between family and friends. The e-commerce giant is just the latest to follow Netflix's account-sharing crackdown. While it's unclear whether this change will work for Amazon, Netflix gained over 200,000 subscribers following its policy change. We also saw a similar account-sharing crackdown with Disney Plus and YouTube Premium. Read more: More Than Just Free Shipping: Here Are 19 Underrated Amazon Prime PerksWhat the Amazon Prime shipping crackdown means for youIf you're the beneficiary of someone else's Prime Invitee benefits, you have until Oct. 1 to take advantage of the current program before the changes take effect.Starting in October, you'll have to get your own Amazon Prime subscription to benefit from the company's free shipping program. First-time subscribers get a year of Prime membership for $15, but you'll be stuck shelling out $15 a month to maintain your subscription thereafter.Read more: Your Free Pass to Prime Day Deals (No Membership Required)

Why is Amazon ending the Prime Invitee program?This move follows shortly after Reuters reported that Amazon's Prime account signups slowed down recently despite an extended July Prime Day event. While the company reported blowout sales numbers, new Prime subscriptions didn't meet internal expectations. In the US, they fell short of last year's signup metrics.  According to Reuters, Amazon registered 5.4 million US signups over the 21-day run-up to the Prime Day event, around 116,000 fewer than during the same period in 2024, and 106,000 below the company's own goal, a roughly 2% decline in both metrics. By forcing separate households to have their own subscriptions, Amazon could be looking to attract more Prime accounts after previously failing to do so.  The new Amazon Family program (previously known as Amazon Household) offers Prime benefits to up to two adults and four children in a single home, including free shipping, Prime Video, Prime Reading and  Amazon Music. The subscription also includes benefits for certain third-party companies, such as GrubHub.
