Did a Human Write That? How I Detect if My Students Used AI for Their Assignments
Robot or human? Use these tested tricks to separate real writing from AI-generated text.
Rachel Kane Contributor and former Senior Editor Rachel is a freelancer based in Echo Park, Los Angeles and has been writing and producing content for nearly two decades on subjects ranging from tech to fashion, health and lifestyle to entertainment and education. She's currently a Professor of Practice at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, helping to mold the new minds who will inherit the media landscape. She's hoping to prevent the singularity by being polite to chatbots and spends way too much time refining Midjourney prompts.

Can you tell if something was written by a human or AI? Sompong Tom/Getty Images
Artificial intelligence has exploded in popularity over the last few years, in large part due to AI chatbots like ChatGPT. As AI evolves, it's become easy for professionals to whip up emails or research -- and for students to write their assignments. The days of paying someone else to compose their essays are over. AI writing tools can do it in minutes.
As a professor of strategic communications, I regularly find students using AI tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly and EssayGenius. It's usually easy to tell when a student has used one of these tools to draft their entire work. One telltale sign is ambiguous language. AI also likes to spit out text with the assignment prompt featured broadly.Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.How to tell if something was written by AISome of the most common ways to tell if something was written using AI are:Key terms from your assignment prompt are used repeatedly.Inaccurate facts are included, thanks to the AI chatbot hallucinating.Sentences don't sound natural.Explanations are generic and repetitive, rather than actually leading anywhere.The tone doesn't sound like their usual writing style.For example, a student might use ChatGPT -- an AI chatbot that uses large language model learning and a conversational question and answer format to provide query results -- to write a short essay response to a prompt by simply copying and pasting the essay question into the tool.Take this prompt: In 300 words or fewer, explain how this SWAT and brand audit will inform your final pitch.This is ChatGPT's result:
Screenshot by Rachel Kane/CNETI have received responses like this, or those very close to it, a few times in my tenure as a teacher, and one of the most recognizable red flags is the number of instances in which key terms from the prompt are used in the final product. Students don't usually repeat key terms from the prompt in their work in this way, and the results read closer to old-school SEO-driven copy meant to define these terms rather than a unique essay meant to demonstrate an understanding of the subject matter.But can teachers use AI tools to catch students using AI tools? I devised some ways to be smarter in spotting artificial intelligence in papers.How to catch AI cheatersHere's how to use AI tools to catch cheaters in your class.Understand AI capabilitiesThere are AI tools on the market that can scan an assignment and its grading criteria to provide a fully written, cited and complete piece of work in a matter of moments. Some of these tools include GPTZero and Smodin. Familiarizing yourself with tools like these is the first step in the war against AI-driven integrity violations. Do as the cheaters doBefore the semester begins, copy and paste all your assignments into a tool like ChatGPT and ask it to do the work for you. When you have an example of the type of results it provides specifically in response to your assignments, you'll be better equipped to catch AI-written answers. You could also use a tool designed specifically to spot AI writing in papers.Get a real sample of writingAt the beginning of the semester, require your students to submit a simple, fun and personal piece of writing to you. The prompt should be something like "200 words on what your favorite toy was as a child," or "Tell me a story about the most fun you ever had." Once you have a sample of the student's real writing style in hand, you can use it later to have an AI tool review that sample against what you suspect might be AI-written work.Ask for a rewriteIf you suspect a student of using AI to cheat on their assignment, take the submitted work and ask an AI tool to rewrite the work for you. In most cases I've encountered, an AI tool will rewrite its own work in the laziest manner possible, substituting synonyms instead of changing any material elements of the "original" work.Here's an example:
Screenshot by Rachel Kane/CNET
Screenshot by Rachel Kane/CNETNow, let's take something an actual human (me) wrote, my CNET bio:
Screenshot by Rachel Kane/CNETThe phrasing is changed, extracting much of the soul from the writing and replacing it with sentences that are arguably clearer and straightforward. There are also more additions to the writing, presumably for further clarity.Can you always tell if AI wrote something?The most important part about catching cheaters who use AI to do their work is having a reasonable amount of evidence to show the student and the administration at your school, if it comes to that. Maintaining a skeptical mind when grading is vital, and your ability to demonstrate ease of use and understanding with these tools will make your case that much stronger.Good luck out there in the new AI frontier, fellow teachers. Try not to be offended when a student turns in work written by a robot collaborator. It's up to us to make the prospect of learning more alluring than the temptation to cheat.
