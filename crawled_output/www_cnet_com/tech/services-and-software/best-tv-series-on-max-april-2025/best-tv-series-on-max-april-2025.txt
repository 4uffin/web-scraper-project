Warrick Page/HBO Max
The Pitt (2025- )
A lot can happen in one day on the job in a hospital's emergency department. This modern-day medical drama fills its 15-hour first season with what transpires during a single shift. Created by ER executive producer R. Scott Gemmill and starring ER's Noah Wyle as chief attendant Michael Robinavitch, this compelling and realistic series is worth checking out.
Liane Hentscher/HBO
The Last of Us (2023- )
This TV adaptation of a popular video game follows hardened survivor Joel (The Mandalorian's Pedro Pascal) and spunky teen Ellie (Game of Thrones' Bella Ramsey) as they face human and not-quite-human dangers in a postapocalyptic world.
Warner Media
House of the Dragon (2022- )
Creating a show as beloved as Game of Thrones is tough to pull off but HBO spin-off House of the Dragon soars to impressive heights. Set hundreds of years before fantasy series GoT, the prequel depicts how infighting and tragedy consume House Targaryen. Multiple players clamor for power, including Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke).
HBO Max
The White Lotus (2021- )
What was initially a limited series was so good HBO renewed it for a second season. The satire about guests at a fancy resort gradually unveils the darker edges of its picture-perfect postcard. The White Lotus features an ensemble cast, including Jennifer Coolidge, Alexandra Daddario, Steve Zahn, Molly Shannon and more hilarious people, who make this series soar. If that wasn't enough, a murder mystery with the big reveal waiting till the very end will keep you thoroughly entertained.
Amanda Searle/HBO
Industry (2020- )
If you're missing the competition and drama on display in Succession, you should pay attention to this HBO series. The first season follows young graduates, including Harper Stern (Myha'la from Netflix's Leave the World Behind), as they step foot into London's Pierpoint & Co. The early 20-somethings hope for permanent jobs at the leading international bank.
Eddy Chen/HBO
Euphoria (2019- )
Euphoria's second installment is on HBO Max now. This visually stunning series has garnered its fair share of fans and it's not hard to see why -- the absorbing performances, cinematography and exploration of mature topics make this show shine. If nothing else, stick around to see Dune star Zendaya, who plays teenager Rue.
Seacia Pavao/HBO Max
Julia (2022-23)
Following the life of television chef and cookbook writer Julia Child, this drama doles out a generous serving of humor and charm (and delicious-looking food, of course). Sarah Lancashire is endlessly watchable as the famed American cook, who paved the way for future cooking shows with her long-running series The French Chef. Two seasons are available on the streamer now.
Crime
Ursula Coyote/HBO Max
Duster (2025)
A hardworking young female FBI agent tries to take down a crime boss with help from his getaway driver in this thrilling crime drama set in Arizona in the '70s. Lost star Josh Holloway plays the smooth guy behind the wheel and Rachel Hilson's character is the first Black female FBI agent in the gripping, jam-packed series co-created by J.J. Abrams and LaToya Morgan.
Macall Polay/HBO
The Penguin (2024- )
Set between Matt Reeves' 2022 film The Batman and the upcoming sequel The Batman Part II, The Penguin stars Colin Farrell as the underestimated and ambitious Gotham gangster (although you'll barely recognize the Oscar-nominated actor). The thrilling, eight-episode season chronicles Oz Cobb's rise and is enhanced by other complicated characters, such as Cristin Milioti's Sofia Falcone and Rhenzy Feliz's Victor Aguilar.
Michele K. Short/HBO
True Detective (2014- )
True Detective may be best known for its first season starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson but the anthology series continues to release intriguing new stories. The latest, which premiered in 2024 after a five-year hiatus, follows Jodie Foster and Kali Reis' characters as they tackle a chilling mystery in the fictional town of Ennis, Alaska. It includes a new showrunner, Issa López, who will helm an upcoming fifth edition.
Kumiko Tsuchiya/HBO Max
Tokyo Vice (2022-24)
Season 2 of Tokyo Vice, a crime drama based on a book by journalist Jake Adelstein, has slickly stepped on to HBO Max. Set in Japan in the late 1990s, this noir follows an American journalist (Ansel Elgort) who nabs a job at a major Japanese newspaper. A world of grisly murders, neon nightclubs and powerful crime bosses awaits.
Comedy
Atsushi Nishijima/HBO
Fantasmas (2024- )
Viewers have former Saturday Night Live writer Julio Torres to thank for this quirky and captivating HBO comedy. In episode 1 of the surreal series, an Alf-like sitcom takes a turn for the awkward and the letter "Q" gets a life story. Torres, also known for the HBO show Los Espookys and A24 film Problemista, stars as a version of himself, and guest actors include Steve Buscemi, Julia Fox, Emma Stone, Aidy Bryant and Bowen Yang.
HBO
The Rehearsal (2022- )
Nathan Fielder, best known for his Comedy Central show, Nathan For You (and cringe comedy), writes, directs and stars in this new HBO series. In the show, the comedian goes to extraordinary lengths to let people rehearse moments before they happen. In the first episode, Fielder helps a man prepare for a confession to a friend, and builds an exact replica of the bar they're planning to meet at (the attention to detail is incredible). After planning for any outlandish thing that might happen, we see how the real exchange between the two friends plays out. Bizarre and truly fascinating, The Rehearsal should get some time on your screen.
HBO Max
Peacemaker (2022- )
Following the events of 2021's The Suicide Squad, this DC spinoff catches up with Peacemaker (John Cena), our towering, costume-clad protagonist who's just been released from the hospital. Peacemaker believes he's a superhero, but with his oft-repeated phrase about attaining "peace, no matter how many people I have to kill to get it," the title doesn't really suit him. The show establishes Peacemaker's next steps -- he isn't returning to prison, instead taking part in a black ops mission that will (again) get his hands dirty. The show often lands its jokes and you'll especially enjoy its entertaining supporting cast.
HBO Max
Hacks (2021- )
The great Jean Smart rightfully takes the spotlight in this acclaimed comedy-drama series. Throwing iPads into swimming pools and delivering withering looks, Smart plays Deborah Vance, a legendary Las Vegas comedy diva who must face the prospect of appealing to a younger audience or disappearing into obscurity. She's partnered with Ava (Hannah Einbinder), a young and equally snarky comedy writer, to freshen up her material. Perfectly balancing its biting insight into how the comedy business treats women, with the warmth of an odd couple buddy comedy, Hacks is one of the best original series to come out of HBO Max.
Ryan Green/HBO
The Righteous Gemstones (2019-25)
This outrageous series highlights a highly dysfunctional family of famous televangelists called the Gemstones. In the show's first season, a member of the family is blackmailed and ridiculous antics ensue. John Goodman stars as the family patriarch, Eli, and Danny McBride, Edi Patterson and Adam Devine also commit to the bit, pulling off an absurd and addictive black comedy. The third season of the show is out now, and HBO has renewed the series for a fourth.
HBO
Somebody Somewhere (2022-24)
Like feel-good shows? Somebody Somewhere is a great option you may have skipped over. In the first episode, 40-something Sam, living in her Kansas hometown and dealing with a recent loss, strikes up a friendship with a co-worker. Authentic, funny, with glowing performances, the half-hour series is the perfect thing to wind down to.
HBO Max
Rap Sh!t (2022-23)
A half-hour comedy series from Issa Rae (the star and creator of HBO's acclaimed series Insecure), Rap Sh!t introduces two former friends from high school. Shawna is an aspiring, socially conscious rapper, and Mia is a make-up artist and single mother
who works multiple jobs. By the end of the first episode, the young women (now in their 20s) have reconnected and filmed a mesmerizing rap video that takes off on the internet. The show's protagonists are phone-obsessed, constantly checking up on social media and recording videos, and it affects the viewing experience in interesting ways.
Jake Giles Netter/HBO Max
Our Flag Means Death (2022-23)
In this comedy set on the high seas, Rhys Darby plays Stede Bonnet, an aristocrat who abandons his cushy life and family to become the captain of a pirate ship. Spoiler: He hilariously bumbles through the gig. Game of Thrones fans may spot Hodor actor Kristian Nairn hanging out among the crew, and the series also stars Taika Waititi as Blackbeard.
HBO Max
The Sex Lives of College Girls (2021-25)
Mindy Kaling co-created this dramedy about four 18-year-old girls who start their freshman year of college together in Vermont. With distinct personalities, the college newcomers navigate love and sex in their own ways. The show is funny, easily bingeable and bolstered by the chemistry among its female leads. A contemporary teen comedy showcasing messy experiences, relatable characters and raunchy jokes.
HBO Max
Starstruck (2021-23)
Starstruck is a classic screwball comedy, starring the lovably goofy Rose Matafeo. She plays Jessie, a twentysomething Londoner who parties it up on New Year's Eve, then later discovers she had a one-night stand with Tom Kapoor, a celebrity played by Nikesh Patel. Follow Jessie as she juggles odd jobs, from cinema worker to nanny, and her blossoming relationship with a film star that involves no high jinks whatsoever. Watch out for scene-stealer Minnie Driver as Tom's agent in this witty, neatly crafted comedy package.
HBO Max
The Other Two (2019-23)
The sibling rivalry is strong and primed for hilarity in this comedy from a couple of Saturday Night Live writers. Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider tell the story of Cary (Drew Tarver) and Brooke (Heléne Yorker), siblings in their late 20s who struggle with the sudden rise to internet fame of their 13-year-old Justin Bieber-channeling brother. Molly Shannon is a treat as their mother, Pat, ushering her children through open doors to success. Once you get over the gimmicky premise, The Other Two's pop culture satire and surprisingly heartfelt storylines are a winning combination. Schitt's Creek fans should give this a look.
HBO
Succession (2018-23)
This satirical show follows the family controlling the world's biggest media and entertainment company, whose members become embroiled in a battle to take over as their father's health declines.
John P. Johnson/HBO
Barry (2018-23)
In Barry's opening scene, SNL alum Bill Hader casually leaves a hotel room that contains a dead body. The actor plays hitman Barry Berkman, who isn't happy with life or his unconventional profession, but his path is altered when he travels to Los Angeles and gets roped into performing in an acting class. Barry features plenty of violence and a deeply troubled protagonist, leaning into the "dark" part of its dark comedy designation. But it's also really funny, and there are four seasons to binge. At the very least, you'll want to tune in for truly great scenes between Hader and his acting teacher, played by Henry Winkler.
Animation
HBO Max
Creature Commandos (2024- )
This engaging DC series from James Gunn examines the backstories of a ragtag team of monsters put together for dangerous missions. From Frankenstein's bride to a Nazi-targeting robot to a creature resembling a human and a furry animal, the Creature Commandos are a motley crew worth spending violent, unhinged time with. The series is the first in Gunn and Peter Safran's new DC Universe and it's already renewed for season 2.
HBO Max
Harley Quinn (2019- )
Harley Quinn is an adult-oriented animated series that centers on the baseball bat-wielding antihero. Kaley Cuoco voices the mayhem-prone Harley, who in the first episode breaks up with the Joker and tells him she's going to replace him as the top villain in Gotham. The hilarious, action-packed show also features characters like Poison Ivy and four seasons are available to binge. It premiered on the DC Universe streaming service before moving to HBO Max.
HBO Max
Scavengers Reign (2023)
An unusual alien world and the humans stranded on it are the subject of this spectacular sci-fi series on HBO Max. The story follows characters marooned on a peculiar planet that's home to fascinating creatures and landscapes. The world is beautiful but also poses dangers to the human guests, who seek out their ship and fellow crew members. An expansion of a 2016 animated short film, Scavengers Reign is a compelling, 12-episode saga you won't be able to quit watching.
Documentary
HBO
Telemarketers (2023)
This docuseries provides an intriguing look at the world of telemarketing, starting the story in the early 2000s, when Sam Lipman-Stern began working at a New Jersey call center. Over the course of three hour-long episodes, Lipman-Stern and office buddy Pat Pespas learn the murky truth about the work they were doing and set out to uncover more about the industry -- a quest that eventually leads them to the halls of Congress. It's worth tuning into these amateur sleuth's unhinged, thought-provoking 20-year journey.
