Peter Capaldi stars in the season 7 episode of Black Mirror titled Plaything. Netflix
There's streaming sci-fi TV shows, and then there are Netflix's streaming sci-fi TV shows. Sure, you can find all sorts of great programming across the streaming landscape, but Netflix has a long-established reputation for delivering top-tier genre shows. Programs like Stranger Things and Black Mirror. But those two examples are just the tip of the iceberg.Science fiction isn't a monolith. There are so many different tones and styles of sci-fi that can fit any mood. Want a dystopian alien invasion thriller? 3 Body Problem is for you. In the mood for an off-kilter superhero series? The Umbrella Academy will surely scratch that itch. And if avant-garde titles are your thing, may I suggest you give The OA a spin?Enough small talk; you know what you like. It's time to beef up that watch-list. These are the best Netflix sci-fi TV shows you should watch right now.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Read more: The Best Sci-Fi TV Shows to Watch on Prime Video Right NowSee at Netflix
Netflix
I Am Not Okay With This
It's one thing to be a teenager and navigate the awkward elements that high school life has to throw at you. But add some newfound superpowers into the mix, and the challenges become even more complicated. This is basically what I Am Not Okay With This is about. The series is based on Charles Forsman's graphic novel and there is only one season. After being renewed, the show was ultimately canceled due to COVID restrictions and budgetary issues.
Eriek N Juragan/Netflix
Joko Anwar's Nightmares and Daydreams
It's sort of expected when a new genre anthology series premieres that someone will eventually compare it to The Twilight Zone. Well, that's exactly what I'm going to do with Joko Anwar's Nightmares and Daydreams. The new seven-episode anthology series leans heavily into horror territory and does so through an Indonesian lens.
Netflix
Devil May Cry
The popular video game series gets the anime treatment in Netflix's Devil May Cry. The gist in a nutshell: Dante, a charismatic demon hunter, has to, well, hunt demons to save humanity. Power Rangers alum Johnny Yong Bosch supplies the voice for Dante in the action-packed series co-created by Castlevania and Dredd producer Adi Shankar.
Netflix
Stranger Things
Stranger Things caught on like wildfire when the genre series quietly premiered its first season on Netflix in 2016. What began as an homage to '80s cinema, with callouts to E.T., Dungeons & Dragons, Goonies and the works of Stephen King, has blossomed into a layered and sweeping sci-fi adventure. The program follows a group of kids in Hawkins, Indiana, who, after meeting a mysterious girl they name Eleven, discover a sinister dimension hiding right under their feet. Government cover-ups, demonic hell-beasts and a cast full of beloved misfit characters make up this tour-de-force genre series.
Mariano Landet/Netflix
Eternaut
Netflix's beautifully shot, post-apocalyptic series is the long-awaited adaptation of the beloved Argentine graphic novel, El Eternauta, which was first published in 1957. The story follows Juan Salvo and a group of survivors who make it through a lethal snowstorm (the snowflakes literally kill) only to discover the real threat against humanity isn't a weather anomaly but an alien invasion.
Netflix
Maniac
Emma Stone and Jonah Hill star in this mind-bending drama from Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective) and Patrick Somerville (The Leftovers). The 10-episode series follows Annie (Stone) and Owen (Hill) as they enter a drug trial for a medication that will allegedly cure all their problems. As you can probably guess, it doesn't. Stone and Hill look like they're having crazy fun throughout the program, as they get to try on a variety of different characters. The addition of Sonoya Mizuno, Justin Theroux and Sally Field to the cast make this an underappreciated gem worth your attention.
Netflix
Travelers
Time travel is the name of the game in this sci-fi series that flew under the radar for many. Led by Will & Grace alum Eric McCormack, the program follows a group of people whose consciousnesses are sent back in time to inhabit other people's bodies to make humanity better by changing the past. It sounds complicated but I assure you, it isn't.
Netflix
3 Body Problem
3 Body Problem was created by Game of Thrones alums David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, along with The Terror showrunner Alexander Woo, and is based on the Hugo Award-winning novel by Liu Cixin. The high-concept sci-fi series connects a watershed moment in 1960s China to the present day, where a group of scientists must face an emerging global threat unlike anything humanity has ever seen.
QUANTRELL D. COLBERT/NETFLIX
Archive 81
This sci-fi horror series, which was loosely inspired by the found footage podcast of the same name, follows a film archivist who restores documentary footage found on a bunch of videotapes from 1994. Through his work, he's sucked into a terrifying mystery surrounding the stuff on the tapes. Netflix may have only given this series one season but it's still a riveting watch.
Netflix
Raising Dion
Raising Dion is a superhero series centered around a special boy named Dion, who happens to have superpowers. Unlike other shows that tackle similar storylines -- think The Boys and Invincible -- this program highlights Dion's differences in an empowering light. Of course, there are supervillains and a sinister government agency to deal with, which keeps things interesting. But what keeps this show unique is its focus on family and finding your place in the world. Also, Jason Ritter is in the cast. And he's wonderful.
Netflix
The Umbrella Academy
Inspired by the comic book created by Gerard Way and Gabriel Bá, the series follows a group of adopted superhero siblings who have been raised to save the world. From time travel to saving humanity from multiple apocalyptic events, the ongoing adventures of the dysfunctional Hargreeves flips expected genre tropes on their heads. It's weird, off-beat, hilarious and poignant.
Netflix
Supacell
Supacell takes the familiar superhero narrative and flips the script. The series follows four Black people living in South London who suddenly develop superpowers. What connects each of them to their newfound abilities are their families' histories with sickle cell disorder -- a common hereditary condition. Using the genre as its narrative foundation, the show delves into the human drama that plays out among these characters while highlighting relevant cultural themes like racism, human trafficking and predatory health-care practices.
Netflix
Black Mirror
Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror set the standard for what a modern-day genre anthology series can do. Each story featured throughout the series, which currently has six seasons and an interactive standalone movie worth visiting, takes place in a near future world where technology has impacted humanity in wonderful, strange and terrifying ways. Uplifting to horrific, Black Mirror is a brain bug of a television show that'll keep you thinking long after the credits roll.
Netflix
The OA
They broke the mold when they made The OA. The two-season series created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij follows the story of Prairie Johnson (Marling), a young blind woman who, after being missing for seven years, returns to her family with her sight restored. Where was she all these years? How can she see? Parallel existence across multiple dimensions, that's how. Okay, that answer barely scratches the surface of this extremely unique and layered program. Come for the Quantum Physics, stay for the interpretive dance routines.
Netflix
Dark
Like Stranger Things, Dark kicks off with the inexplicable disappearance of a child. Instead of another version of the Upside Down plaguing the town, the German series dabbles with time travel to explore how a family and community can be impacted by the event of a kid going missing. A noir slow burn that leans heavily on the horrors of generational trauma, Dark lasted three seasons on Netflix. It will definitely get under your skin.
Netflix
1899
1899 was created by Jantje Friese and Baran bo Odar -- the same duo who brought Dark to Netflix -- and follows a group of passengers on a ship heading to New York during the turn of the century. This is more than a run-of-the-mill period piece. As soon as things kick off, the show throws time travel, multiple dimensions, reality simulations and other bits of sci-fi craziness at the screen. It may not have gotten a season 2 but there's still a lot of genre goodness to mull over here.
Cho Wonjin/Netflix
Parasyte: The Grey
In Parasyte: The Grey, alien parasites land on Earth and begin turning people into shape-shifting monsters. To battle this growing Invasion of the Body Snatchers-style threat, survivors -- otherwise known as "The Grey" -- rise up to save humanity and the planet. Inspired by the manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki, this Korean series should please any horror and sci-fi fan.
Netflix
Sense8
Matrix creators Lilly and Lana Wachowski teamed up with Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski to bring Sense8 to Netflix. The supernatural drama follows eight random people from around the world who learn they are emotionally and mentally linked. Labeled "sensates," the group learns from each other as they literally are forced to walk in each others' shoes and take on new and exciting skills. Things wouldn't be complete without the inclusion of a shadowy organization who's hunting them all down. Over two seasons, the program explored timely issues like gender, sexuality and identity, blending genres like telenovela, K-drama, Bollywood and Euro-noir as it hops around the globe.
Netflix
Altered Carbon
Based on the book by Richard K. Morgan, Altered Carbon exists in a future world where consciousness can be moved from one body to the other. Joel Kinnaman starred in the first season as ex-soldier Takeshi Kovacs. His mission to solve a murder evolves into a journey of self-discovery as he works to track down his lost love and answers regarding his previous life. Season 2 finds Anthony Mackie stepping into the role to further the cyberpunk noir tale.
Netflix
Love, Death + Robots
Mixing different animation styles with live-action, Love, Death + Robots is an anthology unlike many others. The series, which has drawn comparisons to Black Mirror, dips into a multitude of standalone stories that explore a world where sentient robots, creatures and other such beings have more humanity than humanity itself.
Des Willie/Netflix
Lost in Space
Using the 1965 series as inspiration, Lost in Space follows the Robinson family on a space mission to colonize a planet as humanity teeters on the brink of collapse. The show is heavy on family drama, which can be off-putting at times. Thanks to the sociopolitical conflict, a cool alien robot friend and Parker Posey's deliciously villainous Dr. Smith, the show holds up.
Netflix
Manifest
For its first three seasons, Manifest was an NBC original. After it was canceled by the network, Netflix swooped in to revive the series. The story follows the passengers of Flight 828, who arrive at their destination five years after originally taking off. The survivors begin having premonitions and visions that help them save others from disasters that have yet to happen. It's sorta like Lost and Final Destination had a baby, kinda.
Netflix
Alice in Borderland
Alice in Borderland is based on the manga by Haro Aso and follows a group of characters in a parallel version of Tokyo forced to compete in a bunch of twisted games to stay alive. This battle royale-style thriller will appeal to fans of life-or-death competition titles like Squid Game, The Hunger Games and Battle Royale.
