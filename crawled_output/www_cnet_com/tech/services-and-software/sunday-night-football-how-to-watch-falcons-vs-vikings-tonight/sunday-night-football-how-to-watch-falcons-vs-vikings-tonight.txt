Sunday Night Football: How to Watch Falcons vs. Vikings Tonight
How to watch Falcons vs. Vikings
In his first NFL start, J.J. McCarthy led the Vikings to a furious fourth-quarter comeback, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for a third to beat the Bears in Chicago. Now, McCarthy gets his first home start in primetime against the Falcons. The Falcons dropped their opener last week, but second-year QB Michael Penix Jr. looked good in defeat, passing for nearly 300 yards and a touchdown while also running in another, all without turning the ball over.The Falcons-Vikings Sunday Night Football game starts tonight at 8:20 p.m. ET (5:20 p.m. PT). The game is available to watch nationally on NBC or stream on Peacock.
J.J. McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings host the Atlanta Falcons tonight on Sunday Night Football.
