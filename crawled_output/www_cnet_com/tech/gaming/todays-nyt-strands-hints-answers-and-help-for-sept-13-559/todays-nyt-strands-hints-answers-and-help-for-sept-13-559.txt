Need help today's Strands answers? We've got you. James Martin/CNET
Looking for the most recent Strands answer? Click here for our daily Strands hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Mini Crossword, Wordle, Connections and Connections: Sports Edition puzzles.Today's NYT Strands puzzle is fun, but tricky. Even after I had solved for a few answers, I didn't quite understand the theme, though it eventually came to me. (Answer below.) If you need hints and answers, read on.I go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story. If you're looking for today's Wordle, Connections and Mini Crossword answers, you can visit CNET's NYT puzzle hints page.Read more: NYT Connections Turns 1: These Are the 5 Toughest Puzzles So FarHint for today's Strands puzzleToday's Strands theme is: Better than good.If that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Tony the Tiger says this.Clue words to unlock in-game hintsYour goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words. These are the words I used to get those hints but any words of four or more letters that you find will work:SEAT, SEATS, GRAM, GRAMS, PLATE, PLATES, PEAS, NUTS, PLAT, PLATS, LAKE, THEN, MIND, GREAT, STONE, TONEAnswers for today's Strands puzzleThese are the answers that tie into the theme. The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you have all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. Here are the nonspangram answers:APES, AUNTS, LAKES, MINDS, PLAINS, EXPECTATIONSToday's Strands spangram
The completed NYT Strands puzzle for Sept. 13, 2025. NYT/Screenshot by CNETToday's Strands spangram is THEYREGREAT. All the answers can take the word "great" in front of them, like Great Plains, or great aunt. To find the spangram, look for the T that's the farthest-left letter on the top row, and wind down.Toughest Strands puzzlesHere are some of the Strands topics I've found to be the toughest in recent weeks.#1: Dated slang, Jan. 21. Maybe you didn't even use this lingo when it was cool. Toughest word: PHAT.#2: Thar she blows! Jan.15. I guess marine biologists might ace this one. Toughest word: BALEEN or RIGHT. #3: Off the hook, Jan. 9. Similar to the Jan. 15 puzzle in that it helps to know a lot about sea creatures. Sorry, Charlie. Toughest word: BIGEYE or SKIPJACK
