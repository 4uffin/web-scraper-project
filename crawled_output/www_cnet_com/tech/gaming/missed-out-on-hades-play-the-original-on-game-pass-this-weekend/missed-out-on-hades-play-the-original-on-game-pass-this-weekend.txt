Microsoft/CNET
The god-like rogue-like dungeon crawler game Hades is one of the most popular games in recent memory -- and one of my personal all-time favorite games. The gameplay feels smooth, it's easily replayable and the game's writing is full of heart and emotion. Game developer Supergiant Games is gearing up to release Hades 2 soon but if you missed playing the original -- or want to replay it -- you can on Xbox Game Pass now.Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a CNET Editors' Choice award pick, offers hundreds of games you can play on your Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Amazon Fire TV, smart TV and PC or mobile device for $20 a month.
