Best SSD for PS5 in 2025: Internal Storage Upgrade at Every Budget
We tested the best M.2 solid-state drives for the PlayStation 5. Here are our top picks for improving your storage and enhancing your PS5 gaming experience.

Joseph Kaminski Senior Associate Technology Editor / Reviews During my almost twenty years at CNET, I handled benchmark testing/methodologies for both Mac and PC systems and, sometime after, integrated testing for micro-mobility (e-bikes, electric scooters and EUCs), which is a passion of mine. Transitioning from a BMX background to this field was seamless.
Despite testing numerous products, each new one brings the same excitement as my first.

With so many awesome titles available for the PlayStation 5, the console's 1TB solid-state drive can quickly fill up with all that gaming goodness. Luckily, you can easily bulk up your storage and speed by adding an internal SSD. Not all SSDs are equal, though. For instance, the drive needs a heat sink -- an essential component to stave off overheating. If your solid-state drive doesn't have one, you'll have to add it manually (I've made some suggestions below to help with that process). Also, while my testing for the best SSDs is done with a PS5, the speed results in the charts below will give you an overall look at their performance, even if one of these is destined for a desktop.

How we test SSD drives for PS5
PS5 SSD FAQs
What is the overall best SSD for PlayStation 5?You are likely to get strong performance from all the top choices for SSDs (also known as solid-state drives) but some of them are more cost-efficient than others. The best value doesn't mean the best speed. While searching for the best SSD, we landed on the Lexar NM790, as it offers 4TB for less than $300. After all our tests, it was either in line with our other top performers or it was better. The other options on this list were so comparable that if you find a good deal on one of them, they'll do just as well for your PlayStation 5. We've been testing SSDs for years, especially since 2021, when Sony unlocked the option to add more storage. If you're ready to expand your game library, keep reading. We've tested several drives, including the 4TB Seagate FireCuda 530, which we installed in this how-to feature. You can find the results of those performance tests below. One thing to note is that while the test games remained the same, periodic Sony PS5 software updates could also impact speed performance.

Seagate FireCuda 530 NVMe PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD
The big 4TB Seagate FireCuda 530 includes a built-in heat sink, which is a requirement for an internal PS5 drive. There are 1TB, 2TB and 4TB models.After I installed and set up the drive, I tried transferring a few games from the default drive to my new SSD. Call of Duty, which is nearly 200GB, transferred in about 2 minutes, 30 seconds. Returnal -- around 50GB -- transferred in about 40 seconds.   ... Show more

Fastest inexpensive SSD for PS5
PNY CS3150-XHS Gen 5 M.2 SSD
At first glance, the 1TB $146 PNY CS3150-XHS Gen 5 M.2 SSD resembles a mini graphics card, looking more at home in a high-performance PC with its heatsink, dual fans and customizable LED lights. But I had to test it on the PS5 to see if it deserved a spot on the best list. For clarity, I did not connect the fan or use the PS5’s SSD plate cover, allowing for better ventilation.  ... Show more

Best SSD for PS5 without heat sink
PNY XLR8 CS3140 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD
Normally I'd stick with M.2 drives with built-in heat sinks to make the entire upgrade process easier, but I'll make an exception for this PNY XLR8 drive because PNY also makes a separate PS5 SSD cover panel for $20, complete with a built-in heat sink. Just slot the slim M.2 drive in the slot, screw the new cover panel over it and you're all set.

WD Black SN850 Gen4 x4 NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD
Besides the Samsung and Seagate versions, this Western Digital drive is probably the most popular M.2 choice for the PS5. It also includes the needed heat sink built in, which I recommend as a much easier way to get your console storage upgraded. The WD Black comes in 500GB, 1TB and 2TB sizes, although I can't see going through all the effort required to open the PS5 and install these for a mere 500GB of extra space, especially with some games getting close to 100GB in size. 1TB seems like the best value for your money.   ...

Samsung 980 Pro with Heat Sink M.2 SSD
Samsung's high-end M.2 drive was a logical first choice for a lot of PS5 modders, but the original version didn't include a built-in heat sink -- which is required for operation. You could buy a separate one and attach it, but that's a few extra steps.Conveniently, this excellent Samsung 980 Pro SSD is now available with a heat sink, which makes it an all-in-one package. There are two current configurations, a 1TB model and a 2TB model, with the price roughly doubling for the larger model.   ... Show more

MHQJRH M.2 2280 SSD heat sink
If you're going down the add-your-own-heat sink route, this is one of the most popular parts for PS5 owners. Gamers have reported that it's a perfect fit for the PS5's M.2 slot, especially when paired with the Samsung 980 SSD. To attach a heat sink like this, you usually need some thermal tape to connect the heat sink to the drive. In this case, there's an included thermal pad that sticks the two parts together. That's important because, without the right kind of thermal management, the M.2 drive could get too hot in the tightly constricted PS5 internal drive slot.   ... Show more

Samsung 980 Pro 1TB PCIe NVMe Gen4 M.2
This is the original Samsung 980 Pro 1TB drive that needs a separate heat sink. If you've got one and can attach it, it's a less expensive option and easy to find. The price of this model has even dropped by a few dollars. The advantage of adding an M.2 internal drive to your PS5 is that you can both store and play PS5-native games from it. Regular external hard drives can store PS5 games, but not play them. (Both store and play PS4 games.)  ... Show more

Add to compareHow we test SSD drives for PS5
To test these M.2 SSD drives for the very specific purpose of storing and playing PS5 games, our primary concern is data transfer speed. All the drives compatible with the PS5 will play and load games seamlessly. The only time you're likely to notice the drive in action is when transferring full games either to or from it. To test the speed of these drives, we downloaded specific games onto the PS5 internal drive and transferred those games to the newly installed M.2 drive. Then we transferred the same games back to the internal SSD. The games we use for this test are Final Fantasy VII Remake, at 81GB; and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, at 39GB. We used a stopwatch to time the transfers and listed each result in the chart above. PS5 SSD FAQs
We update this list regularly, and below are answers to some of the most common PS5 M.2 SSD questions.
How do I remove the PS5 cover?
Both the front and rear panels of the PS5 are removable. To remove the bottom cover and expose the M.2 drive slot, Sony recommends positioning the console so the PS logo is facing up and the power button is facing away from you. Grip the bottom-left corner of the cover and pull slightly up and to the right so the cover lifts away. You can see a demo of the PS5 cover removal process here.
Show more
Does my M.2 drive need a heat sink?
Yes. Sony requires a heat sink (basically a chunk of metal) to dissipate heat and prevent the drive from overheating. Some M.2 drives include a built-in heat sink, while others need to attach manually via tape or adhesive.
Show more
What games will run from a PS5 M.2 drive?
Unlike an external drive connected via USB-C, an internal M.2 drive can both store and run PS5 and PS4/PS Plus games. An external drive can store both but only play PS4 or older games.
