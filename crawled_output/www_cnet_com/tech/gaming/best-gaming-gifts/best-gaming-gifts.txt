20 Best Gifts for Gamers for 2025
What qualifies as a good gift for a gamer? CNET's editors have found the best gaming gift ideas of 2025.
Article updated on Mar 10, 2025
Lori Grunin Senior Editor / Advice I've been reviewing hardware and software, devising testing methodology and handed out buying advice for what seems like forever; I'm currently absorbed by computers and gaming hardware, but previously spent many years concentrating on cameras. I've also volunteered with a cat rescue for over 15 years doing adoptions, designing marketing materials, managing volunteers and, of course, photographing cats.

Best gaming consoles and VR
Consoles
Sony PlayStation 5 For popular exclusive games like Astro Bot, the PS5 is the way to go (although many of these games eventually make it to PCs much later on). The PS5's big advantage is its modernized, redesigned controller, which gives better haptic feedback. The PS Plus subscription service offers a big, Netflix-like catalog of monthly games, although mostly older ones. It's nearly impossible to find the older version of the console unless you buy refurbished; the current model usually has "slim" somewhere in the name; it's more compact than the original with a little more storage (1TB), but one reason it's smaller is because Sony removed the DVD drive, which is now an option.It's not cheap, and if you're willing to drop even more cash, the $700 PS5 Pro launched in early November. It's not the next-gen model (we won't see that for a while). But it's the most powerful console on the market, running games faster and at higher resolutions.Read our PS5 review and slim PS5 hands-on.

Consoles
Xbox Series S The smaller, cheaper Series S version of the Xbox plays all the same games, but at 1440p resolution, which lies somewhere between traditional HD and 4K. More importantly, it's great for downloading and playing the huge catalog of Xbox Game Pass games or for free-to-play online games like Fortnite. There's a newer model in black with twice the storage for about $50 more, the Xbox Series S 1TB, but it's not necessary unless you specifically want to gift the black or you know your gamer keeps having to delete games because storage is tight. If you want to give the white model, you can spring for an inexpensive plug-in drive to go with it.Read our Xbox Series S and Series S 1TB reviews.

Video Games
Meta Quest 3 VR headset The Editors' Choice-winning Meta Quest 3 is currently XR-pro Scott Stein's pick for the best VR headset. It's backward compatible with the Quest 2 apps and games, plus it's got better graphics, a wider and higher-resolution display, clearer lenses, smaller controllers with better-vibrating haptics and, yes, mixed reality. Like the older model, it's totally self-contained, needs no cables or external tracking cameras, and plays a pretty diverse set of games, from shooters to puzzle games to theme-park rides. And it's not just for gaming; it can be used for fitness training, virtual theatergoing and even VR meetings. Read our review of the Quest 3.

Consoles
Nintendo Switch OLED handheld game console This fourth iteration of Nintendo's Switch hybrid handheld has the biggest, best built-in display (the OLED screen in its name), plus a redesigned kickstand and TV dock. For anyone looking to give a first Switch or add a second unit for household multiplayer, this is the default model to consider. It's also the most expensive at $350, but even that makes it one of the cheaper handheld consoles around. The caveat here is that we're expecting the long-awaited next-generation model within the next 12 months, so you might want to wait and give one in 2025. Read our Nintendo Switch OLED review.

Valve Steam Deck OLED I've got a hoard of gaming laptops, a powerful desktop and more, but the Steam Deck OLED is still my go-to gaming device. It's not for everyone -- really just gamers who have large libraries of games from the popular Steam store and whose games are listed as at least playable on the Steam Deck, if not on the Great on Deck list.The more expensive OLED version is worth the extra cost over the older LCD model -- it starts at $679 versus $399 -- for the bigger, better screen, twice as much storage, faster Wi-Fi and longer battery life. But make sure that your giftee wants one, because once it's opened it can't be returned.Read our OLED Steam Deck review.
$649 at Steam
Close
Analogue Pocket For anyone with a pile of old Game Boy games, the Analogue Pocket is a Game Boy revival dream come true. The Pocket plays Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges, as well as other retro handheld games, like the Sega Game Gear, with separately sold adapters. A sharp color screen and a battery with USB-C recharging mean games look and play fantastically -- and the company just added a nostalgic range of colors. A separately sold dock can play games on a TV screen too. Read our Analogue Pocket review.
$220 at Analogue

Virtual Reality Headsets
PlayStation VR 2 Scott Stein says of the PSVR 2, "While the PSVR 2 does need to be tethered, it's quite possibly the best luxury home VR experience that exists right now." It's got OLED screens, excellent haptic controllers and works with Coke-bottle glasses. All in all, a great addition to anyone's PS5 setup, if you can pay the $550.Read our PSVR 2 review.

Best gaming controllers
Gaming Controllers
Xbox Wireless controller This is the controller that comes bundled with the latest Xbox consoles, so it's pretty basic -- no customization or fancy features. But if the person you're gifting to has an Xbox and likes to play side-by-side with friends, or if they just don't like sharing a controller (raises hand) and need a spare, it's nice to go with a matching model. Plus, they know it will fit in any dual charger they already have.

Mobile Accessories
Backbone One on-phone game controller Game controllers that snap onto your phone can be a pain -- even if they attach easily, they make using your phone even briefly in portrait mode difficult -- but they're the slickest, most natural-feeling way to use a controller with your phone. Backbone's One is one of the top models, with a lot of extra software features that make it more than just a convenience.Models are available for Android and USB-C iPhones and Lightning-connector iPhones, in both Xbox and PlayStation-standard layouts. Before buying, you should know what phone your recipient uses, because these tend to be size- and model-specific (because connectors fall in different places).Read our Backbone One PlayStation and Xbox reviews.

Misc
Razer Kishi Ultra With bigger grips than you typically find on an on-phone controller -- which means there's also room for a full set of controls, including an eight-way d-pad and action buttons, plus Hall Effect triggers, programmable buttons and sturdy analog sticks and USB-C pass-through charging -- it's a lot more comfortable to use for long sessions and feels a lot more like a traditional controller. Of course, that makes it more expensive, too, at $150.See our list of best Xbox controllers.
$150 at Best Buy
Close
Byowave Proteus Controller This one might be tough to get for this holiday season and it's expensive -- $299 -- but it's a very new, modular controller intended for gamers who can't use a standard controller. Reviewer Sean Booker says he thinks other gamers would have fun with it as well, swapping the modules around (they can be hot swapped) and creating custom configurations you can't get anywhere.

Bluetooth Headsets
HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless This midpriced headset is solid all around and extremely comfortable, but it stands out from the crowd for excellent battery life -- which can be crucial for hardcore gamers, so they don't have to deal with wires.Read our  HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless review.

Headphones
Sony Pulse Elite Wireless Audio specialist David Carnoy likes this headset in general because it has excellent sound quality (it uses planar magnetic drivers), multidevice connectivity and good voice calling, combined with the type of must-haves you need for gaming, like a dongle for a low-latency connection to the PS5. Plus, it's midpriced at $150.Read our Sony Pulse Elite Wireless review.

Headphones
SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X If you're looking to spend less than $150, the Arctis Nova 5X is currently the model hanging on my hook. The 2.4GHz dongle works with any device that has a USB-C port, It's got Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connection (not simultaneous, though), it comes with a case and has decent battery life; But they stand out for the mobile app which lets you control a lot, including
equalizer presets when used on consoles and EQ on Bluetooth. There's a Nova 5P model for PlayStation or plain-old Nova 5 for PC, which are cheaper at around $115 (they lack the Xbox support) which are basically the same but without features specific to the Xbox.If you're willing to pay a bit more -- anywhere from $130 to $180 -- the Arctis Nova 7 is better, if only because it allows for simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz. I prefer the dual connections because it can pass through notifications from my phone as well as ringing.Read our SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X review

Keyboards
Logitech G G515 Lightspeed TKL Priced at about $130 -- some variations are more or less -- the G515 is one of my favorite low-profile keyboards for mainstream gaming and everyday use: I'm even typing on it now. It's very quiet with no wobble and a soft landing, comes with either tactile or linear switches, can connect via Bluetooth and USB as well as a 2.4GHz dongle, is very responsive and wakes up fast, and has sturdy doubleshot PBT keycaps with standard stems. Plus, TKL models are smaller than full keyboards, ditching the number pad, so they take up significantly less desk space.

Mice
Razer Cobra Pro wireless mouse In addition to being a good gaming mouse, this model is noticeably narrower and shorter than Razer's other mice but has a full set of features; plus, it can connect via Bluetooth as well as the 2.4GHz dongle and wired, which makes it a good everyday mouse. It's also a good weight -- not an ultralight, as most smaller gaming mice tend to be but which can be a little too light for gamers who aren't action diehards.

Hard drives
WD Black P40 Game Drive Every gamer needs extra storage: It's a fact of our lives. Editor David Carnoy recommends the P40 as the best ultrafast external model, especially now that the price is down to $100 for 1TB, which is probably the lowest capacity that's worth buying. If you're willing to pay more ($180), 2TB is a nicer capacity to gift.

Bambu Lab A1 Mini Combo 3D printer Editor James Bricknell loves printing game models, gaming stands for headsets and more, and this $349 model is his choice for the best entry into the world of color 3D printing. Its bigger cousin, the A1 Combo, is a more feature-rich version, but the Mini is smaller and costs $100 less, which makes it the perfect gift.Read our Bambu Lab A1 Mini Combo review
