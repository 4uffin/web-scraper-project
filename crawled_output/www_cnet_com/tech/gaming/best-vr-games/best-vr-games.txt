Batman: Arkham Shadow is one of the best experiences you can get in a VR headset. Meta
Years come and go, but virtual reality is still a place where some of the most interesting and immersive games exist, if you're curious enough to wear a headset. Thanks largely to the Meta Quest, which remains the most popular VR headset product line in existence, there are lots of fascinating, sometimes extremely active, and compelling games to play. And it's not just on the Meta Quest, which now has a newer line of upgraded-graphics headsets (the Quest 3 and Quest 3S). The PlayStation VR 2 has a solid number of excellent games, PC VR remains a place with many classics, and even Apple's Vision Pro has a couple of good ones.Read more: CNET's Best VR HeadsetsThe number of great VR games each year feels like it's slowing down, but there are still lots of gems. The good news is VR games actually age well. Some of my favorite VR games from years ago are still ones I play regularly. VR's latest trick has been mixed reality, blending passthrough color camera feeds with VR graphics to make it feel like games are bleeding into your real world. Some of the games on this list dabble in mixed reality, too.Best VR Games - May 2025

Batman: Arkham Shadow
If you've ever had the urge to be Batman, this is the best VR Batman experience ever made. Arkham Shadow throws you into a beautiful-looking underworld with controls that let you quickly fight, glide with batwings, and use a bunch of tools. It's been given away free with Quest 3S purchases, but it's well worth buying on its own, even if you're not getting it for free. Release date: Oct. 21, 2024Genre: AdventureDeveloper: CamouflajPlatforms: Quest 3S, Quest 3

Asgard's Wrath 2
One of the biggest and most visually rich RPGs you can play in VR, Asgard's Wrath II is also full of first-person action. This Egyptian-themed game, full of gods and beasts, has a mix of puzzles and combat and a lot of secrets to discover. There's a ton to do, with cinematic worlds and puzzles and a roguelike mode that randomly generates battles in case you somehow finish the dozens-of-hours main story. The graphics aren't quite as good as the PC-only first game in the series, but few Quest 2 or Quest 3 games have looked better.Release date: Dec. 15, 2023Genre: RPG/AdventureDeveloper: Sanzaru GamesPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3

Another Axiom
Gorilla Tag
Don't ask me, ask my kids. The most popular game in VR for years is this weird free social game that uses your arms to propel you through a bunch of worlds that feel as pixelated as Minecraft. The brilliance of Gorilla Tag is its system of arm-driven movement, but its staying power is in its Minecraft-like social universe.Release date: Feb. 12, 2021Genre: ActionDeveloper: Another AxiomPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2

Kluge Interactive
Synth Riders
Much like Beat Saber, Synth Riders is a rhythm-based music game. Synth Riders is a bit more forgiving, asking you to match hand movements to certain positions rather than swinging a virtual saber. It's also one of the few big VR games to also live on Apple's Vision Pro. If you happen to have a Vision Pro and wanted a Beat Saber-like experience, this is your best chance.Release date: June 21, 2018Genre: ActionDeveloper: Kluge InteractivePlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2, Vision Pro

Puzzling Places
Assembling 3D puzzles is a surprisingly challenging experience, and Puzzling Places lets you slowly assemble 3D scans of real places to create immersive models you can expand and peek your head into. Each puzzle can be set up with different amounts of pieces, ramping difficulty up or down as needed. A mixed-reality mode floats the puzzle pieces in your real-world environment, too. Whether you play on Quest, PSVR 2 or Vision Pro, it's always fun.Release date: Sept. 2, 2021Genre: PuzzleDeveloper: realities.ioPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2, Vision Pro

Valve
Half-Life Alyx
Valve's long-awaited sequel to its dystopian first-person sci-fi franchise, which debuted right alongside Valve's Index headset in 2020, is still one of the best things you can play in VR. Set between the events of the first Half Life and Half Life 2, Alyx puts you behind the hands of resistance fighter Alyx Vance, following her journey as she takes the fight to the alien Combine forces. Series fans will be familiar with the world setting and various familiar enemies, but its VR nature makes this game dramatically more immersive, frightening and visceral. From aiming shots at shambling zombies to throwing tin cans at pigeons, Half Life: Alyx makes superb use of VR to make an existing series feel fresh and exciting. Release date: March 23, 2020Genre: ActionDeveloper: ValvePlatforms: Steam

Sony Interactive Entertainment
Horizon: Call of the Mountain
This PlayStation VR 2-exclusive game, made as a VR-focused spin-off of Sony's futuristic and robo-pocalyptic Horizon games, is one of the most beautiful and intense VR experiences next to Half-Life: Alyx. Most of the game involves climbing up mountains and shooting enemies with your bow and arrows, with some puzzle solving thrown in. The game's use of optional eye tracking, rich visuals and uncanny details throughout make it a PSVR 2 must-have.Release date: Feb. 22, 2023Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: PSVR 2

Sony Interactive Entertainment
Gran Turismo 7
All of the already-fantastic Gran Turismo 7 racing game on PS5 is playable on Sony's PlayStation VR 2 headset, making this one of the best PSVR 2 games and one of the best VR games anywhere. Just a couple of caveats: The races are the only part that snap into VR, and GT7 doesn't work with the Sense controllers (you need to use the DualSense controller or a compatible wheel), but the level of driving detail is absolutely stunning.Release date: March 4, 2022Genre: RacingDeveloper: Sony Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: PSVR 2

Capcom
Resident Evil Village
Another PS5 game that has a complete PSVR 2-compatible upgrade, Resident Evil Village looks stunning and takes advantage of the PS5 graphics and the PSVR 2 display to create one of the most detailed immersive horror games yet. The translation to VR isn't always perfect, but it's still an amazing demonstration of how good VR gaming can look.Release date: Feb. 22, 2023Genre: HorrorDeveloper: CapcomPlatforms: PSVR 2

Hello Games
No Man's Sky
No Man's Sky is a game that's only gotten more and more spectacular with age, becoming an endless space adventure with a ridiculous amount of things to do. The entire game can be played in VR, and the results are often jaw-dropping. For sheer play value alone, this is worth adding to your VR collection. The PSVR 2 upgrade is one of the headset's best games.Release date: Aug. 9, 2016Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Hello GamesPlatforms: PSVR 2, Steam

ILM Immersive
Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge
ILM Immersive has made several iconic VR games (if you haven't played Vader Immortal, you should try that too). Tales From The Galaxy's Edge is more free-roaming in its level designs, and is set in the wilds of Batuu, the planet from Disney's Star Wars theme parks. It's also more shooter-based, with some well-designed weapon mechanics. If you want to feel like you're living a Star Wars life for a while, this is your first VR destination (check out Star Wars: Squadrons for another good option for Steam VR). It's almost like a virtual Disney parks souvenir.Release date: Nov. 19, 2020Genre: AdventureDeveloper: ILM ImmersivePlatforms: PSVR 2, Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3

Beat Games/PlayStation
Beat Saber
Two lightsabers, slashing to music. Beat Saber is a music-rhythm movement and dance game that's done so well, it's already in arcades. Slash blocks in particular directions, avoid bombs, duck obstacles and suddenly it's a workout. It's a great rave-dance VR lightsaber workout, and with its frequent music packs and upgrades, it's become one of the all-time VR classics.Release date: May 1, 2018Genre: Rhythm ActionDeveloper: Beat GamesPlatforms: PSVR 2, Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Windows

Polyarc
Moss: Book II
Moss: Book II follows much the same format as the original Moss game, a platformer in which you guide adorable mouse Quill through various puzzles. This sequel sees a continuation of Quill's story, with fresh puzzles, wider, more interactive environments and beautiful visuals. The original Moss and Moss Book II are both fantastic, and you should play them both. But you might as well pick the newest one if you're a newcomer, since it stands on its own and has improved graphics.Release date: March 31, 2022Genre: AdventureDeveloper: PolyarcPlatforms: PSVR 2, Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Mighty Coconut
Walkabout Mini Golf
My overall favorite VR game just might be mini-golf. Walkabout's multiple golf courses are brilliantly designed, with extra-hard challenge modes and hidden golf balls to collect. The game's golf physics are perfect. The multiplayer modes are great for having friends join in online. Several increasingly good courses keep arriving as DLC, from one based on Jim Henson's Labyrinth to Wallace and Gromit course to a series of Jules Verne courses. Every time a new course comes out, I get excited. Seriously, you have no idea how good VR mini-golf is. And the Meow Wolf course is absolutely wonderful.Release date: March 24, 2020Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Mighty CoconutPlatforms: PSVR 2, Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Oculus
In Death Unchained
A bow and arrow, and waves of evil creatures. In Death Unchained's roguelike design, which changes the experience every time you play, is a challenge of pure survival and some incredibly satisfying archery mechanics. It won us over the moment it arrived on the scene, and remains one of the best arcade-like games on the Quest (it's just called In Death on PC).Release date: July 23, 2020Genre: ActionDeveloper: SuperbrightPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Demeo
Tabletop role-playing vibes come to this excellent turn-based VR game that cross-plays to any other platform. The clever design lays out a 3D dungeon map you move through while playing cards from your hand that deal damage. Along with Walkabout Mini Golf, this is the best casual multiplayer VR experience you can have. It's also almost like playing D&D in VR.Release date: May 6, 2021Genre: AdventureDeveloper: Resolution GamesPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2, Vision Pro

Iron Man VR
Ever dream of being Iron Man? This game will have you hovering around in a jetpack, using your hands to aim and blast through a series of missions that are surprisingly kinetic and fun. Iron Man was originally a game on the PlayStation VR, but the move to Quest is far more fun because there are no wires to worry about getting tangled in. Release date: July 3, 2020Genre: ActionDeveloper: CamouflajPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Skydance Interactive
Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners
If you love zombies and survival action, Saints & Sinners and its Chapter 2 sequel are the way to go. These games look great on the PC and also play well on the Quest and PSVR 2. Survival horror and a surprisingly deep adventure make this and the original game must-haves.Release date: Jan. 23, 2020Genre: ActionDeveloper: Skydance InteractivePlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2

Tetris Effect
Named after the real-life cognitive phenomenon and designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, the creator of Rez Infinite and the classic Lumines, this is Tetris in VR. And it's incredible. Music and visuals sync with your moves to create synaesthetic, hypnotic flow gaming. It's also a great way to show off the PSVR 2's high-contrast display. On the PSVR 2 and PC, it doubles as a 2D game.Release date: Nov. 9, 2018Genre: PuzzleDeveloper: EnhancePlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam, PSVR 2

Population One
The multiplayer battle royale experience of Population One is very Fortnite-like. In fact, it's extremely Fortnite-like. That's a good thing. There are few large-scale multiplayer VR games right now, and this is one of the best. Dropping down from above, navigating the shrinking map, climbing and hunting for supplies, and excellent controls make this a must-play team shooter. Plus, there are constant season updates.Release date: Oct. 22, 2020Genre: ActionDeveloper: BigBox VRPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Eleven Table Tennis
Ping-pong in VR is a workout. The table tennis physics in Eleven Table Tennis are superb, making this one of the most realistic simulations you can have in a headset. The difficulty levels ramp up to some seriously unforgiving levels, too.

I Expect You To Die 3
VR is a great format for escape room experiences. I Expect You to Die is a game you can play seated, leaning over desks and flipping switches, using telekinetic powers to control items from afar. The puzzle designs can be as challenging as any escape room I've ever been in. The series has three games now, but you might as well start with the newest one.Release date: Aug. 17, 2023Genre: PuzzleDeveloper: Schell GamesPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

You have no idea how intense VR rock climbing can be until you've tried The Climb 2. You use your hands to reach up and grab ledges, grab ropes and zipline. It sounds easy, and yet discovering ledges, holding the right grip and keeping focus can be a real challenge. It's also absolutely beautiful.Release date: March 24, 2021Genre: ActionDeveloper: CrytekPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3

Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes
One of the best VR games only requires one person to wear a headset. In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is in a tiny room, faced with a fiendish bomb to defuse. Everyone else has the hilariously complex bomb defusal manual and both sides have to describe the bomb, and the instructions, before it explodes. A party game classic.Release date: July 26, 2015Genre: PuzzleDeveloper: Steel Crate GamesPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

Superhot VR
With or without VR, Superhot has a brilliant conceit: Time only moves when you move. Which means you can be utterly surrounded by enemies bristling with machine guns or ones ready to slice you into pieces, and still defeat them all by -- oh so slowly -- brushing their weapons aside, dodging bullets, throwing pots and pans, etc. Every level plays like a puzzle as much as a shooter, and you come out looking like an action hero every time. Release date: Dec. 5, 2016Genre: ActionDeveloper: Superhot TeamPlatforms: Quest 2, Quest 3S, Quest 3, Steam

What is the best VR game right now?
That's a totally subjective question, but my personal answer for "Best VR Game Ever" is Walkabout Mini Golf: its collection of immersive mini golf courses are phenomenal, and it's a great multiplayer soclal game to try. But Half Life: Alyx also remains one of the most impressive immersive adventures available in a headset.
Best VR games FAQ
Is VR growing or dying?
VR always feels like it's somewhere in between life and death. Meta's Quest headsets remain strong sellers, but the state of VR games overall feels like it's stalled out a little since it's not as profitable a territory for developers compared to mobile or standard PC/console designs which can be ported to other hardware more easily. Good VR games tend to not be very playable out of a VR headset, although there are a good handful of 2D games that have VR-playable modes.
Can you burn fat playing VR games?
Absolutely. In fact, VR gaming is one of my favorite ways of getting fit. If you play a game like Beat Saber and track your heart rate, you'll see the impact. Just keep in mind that sweating in VR can easily happen, and you should get a silicone sweat-resistant face mask for yours if you're considering getting super-active.
How we came up with the best VR gamesCNET has a wide variety of writers with decades of collected experience playing games and experiencing VR. While we're not always able to catch everything that's new, we pay attention to how much time we spend in VR games and how much of an impact they make on us. We jump between all the VR platforms to help make our decisions.
