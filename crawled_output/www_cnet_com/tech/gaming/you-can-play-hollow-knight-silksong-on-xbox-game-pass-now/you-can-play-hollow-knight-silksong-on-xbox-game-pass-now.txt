Microsoft/CNET
The wait is over. After years of rumors and speculation, Hollow Knight: Silksong, the sequel to the award-winning indie darling Hollow Knight, is here. And Xbox Game Pass subscribers can play the highly anticipated sequel right now at no additional cost. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, a CNET Editors' Choice award pick, offers hundreds of games you can play on your Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Amazon Fire TV, smart TV and PC or mobile device for $20 a month. A subscription gives you access to a large library of games, with new ones, like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, added monthly, plus other benefits such as online multiplayer and deals on non-Game Pass titles. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Here are all the games Microsoft added to Game Pass recently. You can also check out the games the company added to the service in August, including Gears of War: Reloaded. Hollow Knight: SilksongGame Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can play now.The wait is over for one of the most anticipated indie games in recent memory. You play as the hunter and princess Hornet as she ascends to Hallownest's peak. You'll venture through mossy grottos, craft deadly tools and take on over 200 powerful bugs with acrobatic skills as you climb to the top. But you aren't just taking down everything in your path. You'll also befriend strangers and unlock secrets that might help you in your quest. I Am Your Beast Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass and Game Pass Standard subscribers can play now.This covert, revenge thriller is like a comic book in game form. You play as a retired secret agent who gets called in for "one last job." But unlike other stories where the hero says, "Yes," you say, "No." So now the military-industrial complex is hunting you through the North American wilderness. You have to evade your enemies and sabotage their equipment to survive.
Nine Sols New to Game Pass Standard.Don't let the cute cat-like hero fool you; this game can be brutal. This 2D action platformer is about revenge. You play as an ancient hero who awakes from a 500-year slumber to embark on a vengeful journey against those who imprisoned them. The hand-drawn art style and gameplay inspired by Sekiro make this a uniquely challenging and beautiful game. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers could play this game in December, and Game Pass Standard subscribers can play this difficult but rewarding game soon, too. Cataclismo Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can play now.This game combines resource management, real-time strategy, siege defense and exploration into one title. Creatures from a corrupted world, called Horrors, are seeking to destroy humanity, so you have to build intricate fortresses to fend off waves of enemies. Once the Horrors are gone, you'll forage for resources outside of your defenses during the day to help in the next night's attacks. Will you be able to find a way to put a stop to the Horrors once and for all, or will you fall like the rest of humanity?
Paw Patrol World Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass and Game Pass Standard subscribers can play now.Microsoft removed this kid-friendly game from Game Pass in February, and the company is bringing it back to the service this month. You can play as Chase, Skye, Marshall or Everest as they save the day across locations like Adventure Bay, Jake's Mountain, the Jungle and Barkingburg. Use your nose to sniff out secrets and pup treats you can use to unlock new outfits and more for your pup.
RoadCraft Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can play now.When natural disasters strike, someone has to clean up the damage and restore the local infrastructure. That's where you and your company come in. You'll use construction machinery to clear debris, replace faulty equipment and rebuild roads, bridges and more. Don't just throw all that debris away. Some of it can be recycled and used for reconstruction in this building simulator.  Subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $20 a month
