If you want to upgrade your TV's sound, the big choice is between the convenience and affordability of a soundbar, and the superior sound quality -- and extra cost -- of an AV receiver and a set of surround-sound speakers. Both options will enable you to experience high-quality sound, including Dolby Atmos, for your movies and TV shows. Both can also offer streaming music via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi from your phone. and may also enable voice assistant control from Alexa or Google Assistant. Soundbars and speaker systems both have their pros and cons, so where do you start?Here's what you need to know.How much do you want to spend?
The Sonos Ray is an affordable soundbar that offers multiroom music. Ty Pendlebury/CNETFirst, you'll need to decide what your budget is, and how much of your living space you're willing to give up. Soundbars require less money and space, while AV surround setups take more of both. One of the main advantages of a soundbar system is that you don't need to lay out as much cash. Excellent soundbars can be had for around $100, while spending around $300 for a soundbar will get you something pretty great. If you're spending over $500 on a soundbar, though, you should really think about separates.It may take more time and money to assemble a separate speaker system, but the effort is well worth it. For this, you'll need at least a pair of stereo speakers ($200 and up) and an AV receiver, which will cost at least $300 on its own. The advantage to all of this is that you'll then have a platform that you can build upon and grow as your finances allow.  Buying a complete 5.1-or-more speaker set may be even more expensive up front, but will give you full surround sound (with rear speakers, a center speaker for dialogue and a subwoofer for bass), and its performance will be that much richer.  TL;DR: Got under $500 to spend? A soundbar is your best bet. Over $500? Get an AV receiver and decent stereo speakers, and you can upgrade over time.Soundbars
Roku Streambar
Best budget soundbar
2023
The Roku Streambar is both insanely affordable and surprisingly talented. It will lift the sound of dialog in your movies to make it more understandable, but the speaker's secret weapon is its built-in 4K streamer. The entire system is easy to use and sounds great.

Sonos Beam (Gen 2)
Best soundbar for movies and music
The Sonos Beam (Gen 2) is a soundbar that combines the best of both worlds -- excellent Dolby Atmos immersion in your favorite films, and seamless music streaming. The Beam is easy to use and sounds great, too. You can also use it as part of a Sonos multiroom system for streaming wherever you happen to be at the time. Even on the go with the Sonos Ace and Sonos Roam 2. Read CNET's review of the Sonos Beam Gen 2.

If you're just starting out, the best way to upgrade your TV sound is with a soundbar. It's simple: everything you need is included in the box and it's easy to set up. There are only a couple of cables to connect, and they don't require multiple speakers in the room. As we discuss in our soundbar buying guide the best features to look for are Bluetooth and a HDMI-ARC or optical digital connection.
Soundbar advantages Affordable.Easy to set up.Sound a lot better than TV speakers.Self-contained, so it doesn't need a separate amplifier to make it work.Some models include advanced features such as Dolby Atmos compatibility or surround speakers (or the ability to add them later).Soundbar disadvantages Don't sound as good or play as loud as a full surround-sound system, especially in big rooms.Usually can't upgrade individual components or add new surround formats.Limited features compared to a receiver.Spending more won't necessarily improve sound quality. (Soundbars can only be so big without blocking the TV.)Read more: Best SoundbarsSpeakers and surround soundThere are many different brands of receivers and speaker-makers that it can be hard to know where to start. Here's a solid "starter set" to give you an idea of what $900 buys. First, pick your speakers and then add a receiver.Either...

If the Klipsch speaker package is no longer on sale, then a pair of great stereo speakers could be all you need, and the Elac Debut 2.0 B5.2 punches well above its weight. The pair offer eye-catching looks and a decent price tag to boot. Though these have been replaced by a newer model, these are currently on sale for $269.

Onkyo TX-NR6100
The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver under $1,000 and offers everything you need to build a great system. It offers 8K video compatibility (for whenever you might need that), streaming features and support for Dolby Atmos. It sounds amazing for the money and is simpatico with Klipsch speakers in particular.

If you're a home theater fan, then a surround-sound system is probably what you're after. Having a 2.1, 5.1 or Atmos
5.1.4-channel setup delivers an audio experience that can't be beat by a soundbar at any price. The sound is bigger and more enthralling, an advantage that's particularly important in large rooms. For instance the Klipsch Reference Theater Pack offers a big sound from a compact system. It's on sale at Amazon right now for $400. You don't need a whole bunch of speakers, though, as you can start with a pair of stereo speakers and a receiver or integrated amp. You can later add surround speakers, Atmos heights and/or a subwoofer for sound that rivals your local cinema. Though the complexity increases over a soundbar, adding a universal remote will help make the system more user-friendly for the less technical of your friends and family. If you want to know more check out our receiver buying guide, which I've summarized below.Surround system advantages Better sound quality, including true surround effects with rear speakers.You're no longer bound by manufacturer and can mix and match as you like.Adding height or surrounds doesn't mean necessarily buying a whole new system.Very flexible, as you can upgrade either the receiver or speakers at a later date.Surround system disadvantages Costs more than a soundbar.Takes up more space.More complex.Wires and more wires.Read more: Best AV ReceiversOther alternatives
Powered speakers: There are an increasing number of powered speakers designed to fill the gap between soundbars and surround systems. These can be straightforward systems like the $160 Klipsch RP-15M or more specialized offerings like the Roku Wireless speakers. Headphones: Most TVs offer headphone jacks while newer TVs also include Bluetooth outputs to connect wireless headphones. If you want a semi-wired option then the Roku Smart Remote comes with a 3.5mm jack onboard for use with Roku TVs and streamers. Headphones are particularly useful for use in environments where you don't want to disturb others, and they can be bought quite cheaply.  Which should you buy?If you're looking for the simplest possible solution to improving TV sound, get a 'bar or maybe a pair of powered speakers first. There are plenty of affordable options available, and you don't need to sacrifice style for performance. The sweet spot for a soundbar is between $200 and $300, as spending any more than that doesn't guarantee improved performance.
If you're serious about sound quality though, separates are the only way to go. You can mix and match according to your needs, and it's easier to upgrade once new formats come in -- you won't need to replace everything if you want to add 8K video capability, for example.
Whichever option you choose, you will never need to go back to tinny, little TV speakers ever again. Happy listening.
