How we test
What to consider
Budget
Before anything else, you should consider how much you're willing to spend on your new soundbar.
Dolby Atmos
If you're looking for a more realistic and immersive audio experience, you'll want to make sure your soundbar supports Dolby Atmos.
HDMI Connections
A soundbar should have at least one HDMI input, and preferably more. The ability to connect multiple cables will help users with a large selection of sources
Subwoofer and Surround Speakers
Single-bar systems are great for smaller TVs, while a soundbar-and-subwoofer combo is better suited for a living room. Consider your needs before opting for a larger home theater setup.

Back to selection
Any television you buy today will have onboard speakers, but every single one can be improved with the addition of a great-sounding soundbar. With the right model, you get the benefits of a home theater system or AV receiver without having to run messy wires or take up as much space. I've tested hundreds of products from big-name brands over the years to help you discover the best soundbar for your needs. From more basic models to those packed with features like Dolby Atmos, Bluetooth, built-in streaming, multi-room audio and immersive surround sound, here are my picks for the best soundbars of 2025.

Roku Streambar
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Compact and easy to set up with just one cable
Excellent dialogue reproduction
Tried-and-true user-friendly Roku experience with built-in streaming capabilities
Side-firing speakers create a large sound image
5.1 audio processing allows for later hardware upgrades (subwoofer, surround speakers)
Cons
Lacks bass and mid-bass in movies and music
No dedicated music mode
What makes it stand out:The Roku Streambar delivers impressive vocal clarity that makes dialogue easy to understand. It features a compact, 14-inch design and is remarkably easy to set up with the connection of a single HDMI cable. Thanks to its side-firing speakers, it's able to create a surprisingly wide stereo image. Being a 4K streamer, in addition to a speaker, the Streambar also features the excellent Roku interface. Though it's not the loudest or most bass-heavy model, the Streambar is able to fill a room in a way that belies its tiny footprint.Perfect for these listeners: The Roku Streambar is ideal for people who want to upgrade both their TV's sound and streaming capabilities without spending a lot. Its tidy footprint makes it ideal for small TVs and smaller spaces. The Streambar particularly shines for speech-heavy content such as news and dramas, providing articulation that makes it easy to follow. Those looking to upgrade their surround sound later will appreciate the add-ons, including Roku's wireless subwoofer and surround speakers or the Walmart-exclusive Onn products. Consider alternatives if:Movie enthusiasts expecting theater-like sound will be disappointed by its bass response, while music listeners will find some songs lack dynamics and punch. While adding the $130 Onn subwoofer helps significantly, that expansion does double your investment. If, like many people, you already own a streamer device, half of what you're paying for on the Streambar becomes redundant. The Streambar also has limited connectivity, with just an optical digital input and HDMI ARC, requiring you to use your TV as a switcher for game consoles and other devices.   ... Show more

Best smart soundbar
Yamaha YAS-209
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent sound in a compact size with articulate, punchy subwoofer
Feature-packed, including Amazon Alexa and six media-specific presets (music, TV, movie, sports, gaming and stereo)
Onboard DTS Virtual:X for simulated surround effects
Easy setup and use with companion Yamaha Sound Bar Controller app and an intuitive, large remote
Cons
Uses LED lights that are difficult to read instead of on-screen display
Surround sound is just OK, with only two channels of drivers
What makes it stand out: The Yamaha YAS-209 packs in everything I expect from a midpriced soundbar: ease of use, powerful output levels and an ability to replay both movies and music to a high standard. The soundbar offers an immersive experience with movies, thanks to DTS Virtual:X, and better separation of instruments and a broader stereo effect (in its Stereo mode) compared to competitors. The wireless subwoofer demonstrates better articulation with music tracks, avoiding the bloated sound that some competitors can produce. As Yamaha's first smart speaker, it implements Amazon Alexa effectively -- the microphones work well even in loud environments, and it's able to hear commands without shouting.Perfect for these listeners: The YAS-209 is ideal for those seeking a midrange soundbar with excellent performance for both movies and music. Home theater enthusiasts will appreciate the DTS Virtual:X for simulated surround effects from a single bar. Those who want connectivity options will find HDMI, optical digital and Bluetooth, plus Ethernet and Wi-Fi for Spotify Connect. It's perfect for people who want the convenience of voice control, as it incorporates two microphones for use with Amazon Alexa. The fact that you can ask Alexa for a song -- and have it sound better than pretty much any smaller smart speaker -- makes it particularly appealing for music lovers who've embraced smart home technology.Consider alternatives if: Users invested in the Apple or Google ecosystems will be disappointed, as the Yamaha only works with Amazon Alexa. There's also no AirPlay 2 or built-in Chromecast. The subwoofer is quite large at roughly 16 inches square and 7.5 inches wide, making it potentially intrusive in smaller spaces. Those who prefer visual feedback when adjusting settings might be frustrated by the lack of an on-screen display, and the tiny LEDs on top that are too small to see from across the room. Finally, music purists might note that its Music mode adds reverb to vocals and less separation between instruments than its Stereo mode, and it can sound slightly compressed during complex musical passages.  ...

Best budget soundbar
Vizio SV210M
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Immersive sound with DTS Virtual:X that emulates a surround system
Versatile connectivity with four ports and Bluetooth compatibility
Powerful bass and expressive midrange with 2.1 channel audio
Four EQ presets for varied listening
Cons
Subwoofer is small and not very articulate
Voice assistant connection not super useful and difficult to operate
Some sound distortion at louder volumes
What makes it stand out: The Vizio 2.1 Soundbar (SV210M) is a great soundbar for the money. This stereo soundbar features a modern design with rounded edges and is paired with a wireless subwoofer that's so small it should be easy to find a place for it. Despite its compact 30-inch width, the Vizio delivers room-filling sound -- if I closed my eyes, I couldn't tell where the speaker was, which is an achievement for a budget model. For music and movies, this soundbar is all that many people will need. The tiny sub can put out some hurt when needed, handling explosions with impressive power. It’s an absolute winner.Perfect for these listeners:The Vizio 2.1 is ideal for anyone with a limited space and budget, thanks to its compact soundbar and wireless subwoofer for under $200. Music lovers will appreciate its natural and fun touch with their favorite songs while still being able to hit deep bass notes. Movie dialogue positively sizzles, and sound effect reproduction is raw and untamed (in a good way). With impressively-performing listening modes for both music and movies, the Vizio 2.1 Soundbar is all that many people will need.Consider alternatives if: If you have an older TV without HDMI connections, you'll need to look elsewhere; The Vizio 2.1 lacks analog or optical connections. Home theater enthusiasts seeking true Dolby Atmos effects will be disappointed -- while it can read Dolby Atmos and DTS signals, it can't produce genuine height effects. The soundbar also lacks a physical remote control, offloading setting changes to the Vizio Mobile app, which requires a Bluetooth connection first. Audiophiles who prefer a "direct mode" for music listening should note that the soundbar bounces sound off your walls, even when set to Music mode.

Best high-end soundbar
Sennheiser Ambeo Max Soundbar
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Unmatched sound with 13 drivers, including five high-fidelity tweeters and six long-throw woofers
Great connectivity with six ports including HDMI eARC and Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Google Chromecast
Same price as buying a separate receiver and speakers, but more compact
Unique calibration microphone determines the room's acoustics for best possible surround effects
Cons
Very, very expensive
No subwoofer included
Not great with music (too midrange-forward)
Massive size won't fit under most TVs
What makes it stand out: The Sennheiser Ambeo is the best surround experience I've had from a single speaker. I don't know what kind of black magic this is, but you should hear it for yourself. While competitive soundbars from the likes of Sony make movie dialogue sound big and atmospheric, the Sennheiser sounds both big and precise. Without rears, the Sennheiser can make voices hover over the top of your head, though, like any system I've ever heard, it can't convince you things are behind you. Perfect for these listeners: The Ambeo is perfect for serious home theater enthusiasts who value cutting-edge surround sound technology and want the absolute best performance from a single soundbar, without the hassle of separate speakers. The Ambeo's precision with surround effects and dialogue clarity make it excellent for movie lovers who want to hear every detail in soundtracks. People who enjoy genres like blues and folk music will find that the Ambeo performs especially well with these musical styles. For those who want to be at the very apex of cutting-edge surround sound from a single bar, the Sennheiser Ambeo is where you'll want to be.Consider alternatives if: Despite its impressive surround performance, the Sennheiser Ambeo isn't for everyone. At its full price of $3,000, budget-conscious shoppers should know there are excellent Atmos soundbars available for a fraction of the price. The Ambeo underperforms with music, exhibiting a midrange-forward sound that makes harsh music sound harsher, especially in the dedicated music mode. The Ambeo also lacks dynamic heft and deep bass, making explosive movie sound effects sound somewhat inconsequential. While adding a subwoofer can give the speaker more authority, it also pushes the system cost to around $4,000. Those who want features like Bluetooth output for wireless headphones or a headphone jack will be disappointed, as neither is included, despite the premium price.

Best value Sonos soundbar
Sonos Ray
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent sound with two midwoofers and two tweeters that have waveguide to focus high frequencies outward
Compact, attractive design that comes in two colors (black and white)
Simple connection and easy setup
Unmatched multi-room system for all-over sound
Cons
No HDMI connection
Lacks extra features like voice assistant or Dolby Atmos capability
No designated remote control (must control with phone or TV remote)
What makes it stand out: The Sonos Ray is the closest thing yet to a Sonos One speaker the company has made in soundbar form, and that's a significant achievement. Despite its compact 22-inch width and simple design, the Ray delivers sound that belies its physical dimensions. The key to this performance lies in its proprietary tweeters with waveguides that focus high frequencies outwards, allowing it to produce a surprisingly wide soundstage. The vocals sound super crisp, and both the highs and bass are full with a tight overall sound. At $279, it's part of the exciting trend toward affordable audio gear that actually sounds good. Perfect for these listeners: The Sonos Ray is ideal for those who primarily use their soundbar for music, as it performs particularly well with this content, sometimes even outshining the more expensive Sonos Beam. The Ray makes a perfect complement to a bedroom TV and would also work well to upgrade a television in a smaller living room. Those who want to start building a Sonos multiroom system will find the Ray an excellent entry point, as it includes all the streaming capabilities that make Sonos the gold standard of multiroom speakers. It offers dozens of streaming services and connections with Apple AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect. Consider alternatives if: The Sonos Ray isn't for everyone, particularly those looking for the most bang for their buck in terms of home theater performance. The Ray lacks HDMI connectivity, which seems an odd omission given that almost every new soundbar -- even the $80 ones -- now includes an HDMI port. While most TVs have an optical output, this connection limits the soundbar to Dolby Digital sound formats. The Ray also doesn't include a voice assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant built in (though you can control it using a separate smart speaker). Those seeking powerful bass effects should consider alternatives with separate subwoofers, as the Ray sounds positively anemic compared to speaker systems. The Speech Enhancement feature is also quite subtle compared to competitors, which offer numerous levels of voice enhancement and are more effective for making dialog more understandable.  ...

Best PC soundbar
Creative Stage
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Ultra-affordable option
Tiny, industrial design that's user-friendly and perfect for small spaces
Four ports, including USB for MP3s and Bluetooth connectivity
Clear sound with available bass and treble adjustments
Cons
Lacks true low-bass and stereo separation
Limited sound projection and volume due to smaller size
What makes it stand out: The Creative Stage delivers a compelling mix of sound quality and features at an ultra-affordable price. It includes both a separate subwoofer and an HDMI ARC input, something that's unheard of at this price. The system comes with a comprehensive remote control, which includes four sound modes and independent volume control for the sub. The Creative's separate sub really helps bring out the best in movies and video games, and while it may not be the most articulate model, it digs relatively deep. When set to gaming mode, the Creative system was able to keep up with gunfire, explosions and spatial cues without folding into a hard ball of distortion.Perfect for these listeners: The Creative Stage is especially well-suited for PC gamers who want to make every penny count. It truly excels as a desktop or gaming system, creating a better stereo image at 3 feet versus a couch-based 6 feet. Its compact dimensions make it ideal for smaller spaces and TVs for those on a tight budget -- its sound will trounce the built-in speakers of just about any TV. The connectivity options make it versatile for various setups: it includes Bluetooth wireless, an optical input, HDMI ARC and even a USB port for playing MP3s from an external drive. People sharing walls or floors with neighbors will appreciate the ability to independently adjust the subwoofer volume for more considerate listening.Consider alternatives if: Those looking for a primary TV soundbar for average to large living rooms should look elsewhere, as the Stage doesn't play as loud as you might want in a living room environment. Due to the physical length restrictions of the cabinet, it offers little stereo separation when heard from a couch -- it's all vocals and mostly mono at that distance. The subwoofer is tethered by an 8-foot cable that, while perfect for going under a desk, isn't long enough to be effective when placed alongside a couch in a living room setup. Music enthusiasts might find the Creative less engaging than competitors, and while it does well with movies and TV shows compared to systems without a soundbar, it can't compete with its competitors’ ability to go much louder without losing control.  ...

Factors to consider when choosing a soundbar
Everyone's audio needs are different, so be sure to consider your unique preferences, space and listening habits. Use this guide to navigate the options and find the best soundbar for you. If you need a little extra help, check out my complete guide to how to buy a soundbar in 2025. BudgetThe most important consideration when choosing a soundbar is working out how much you can spend, and I have found there are great soundbars at every price, starting at $100. If you're looking for more premium, feature-packed models, be prepared to spend a lot more -- upwards of $3,000. I do have one rule of thumb: Once the price of a soundbar exceeds $500, you may find it more worthwhile to save for an AV receiver and speakers. If you're a movie buff, consider splurging on features like Dolby Atmos to bring the theater experience home. Music lovers will want to prioritize audio reproduction and multi-room or wireless streaming to fill their space with sound. Gamers should look for soundbars with dedicated gaming presets that enhance dialogue clarity and directional audio cues.Room sizeConsider your room's size and layout. Smaller spaces, like bedrooms and offices, might be overwhelmed by high-wattage soundbars with separate subwoofers. Single-bar systems are great for smaller rooms and TVs, as their length allows for built-in stereo sound while still being compact. Larger rooms or home theater setups will benefit from more robust soundbars with additional speakers and subwoofers to produce that booming surround sound.Also think about where you'll place it -- will it sit on an entertainment console, be mounted on a wall or fit beneath your TV? Be sure that your soundbar can physically fit in the desired space by checking the dimensions and mounting capabilities.
Use the following guide to see which soundbar length we recommend for each TV size:
Speaker length (in inches)Recommended TV screen size 12 Any38 to 45 42-inch to 50-inch50 55-inch to 65-inch60 70-inch and larger
Audio format compatibilityMatch your soundbar's audio format to the content you enjoy most. Here are a few of the most important audio formats and their use cases to consider when choosing a soundbar:Dolby Atmos for 3D soundscapes with height channels that create immersive experiences perfect for movie buffsDTS:X for object-based audio that adapts to your specific speaker setup, ideal for home theater enthusiastsPCM (Pulse Code Modulation) for uncompressed digital audio commonly found on Blu-ray discs and gaming consolesDolby Digital 5.1 for traditional surround sound with five speakers and a subwoofer, the standard for DVD contentBluetooth audio codecs (AAC, aptX, LDAC) for wireless streaming with varying levels of quality, essential for music streaming from mobile devicesCheck your TV's connection options (HDMI ARC/eARC, optical) to ensure compatibility with the soundbar you choose. How CNET tests soundbars
At the AV Lab in New York City, I test soundbars head to head with a variety of reference equipment. Ty Pendlebury/CNETCNET follows a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process for all of its soundbar testing. In the CNET AV Lab, I do comparative testing, pitting similar soundbars against each other side by side.I evaluate the sound performance of each soundbar with several different types of content, including movies, music, TV shows and games. I use several test scenes, mainly from action movies, including the opening of Mad Max: Fury Road for playback of the spatial audio standard Dolby Atmos for soundbars that support it. I also use the Thanator attack scene of Avatar (26.53) to test a system's dynamics and detail retrieval. CNET's dedicated audio lab in downtown New York includes a selection of recent televisions (with HDMI eARC), plus Apple TV 4K streamer and Roku Ultra streamer, a Microsoft Xbox Series X and an Oppo UDP-205 4K Blu-ray player. I also use Roon music software to stream to individual devices or the Oppo player as needed.
From top: Sony UXP-700 Blu-ray player, AVPro 8x8 4K UHD Matrix Switch and Oppo BDP-203 Blu-ray player. David Katzmaier/CNETWhen it comes to music, I use several CNET test tracks, which you can find here in a Tidal or Spotify playlist. Tracks such as Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' Red Right Hand, with its deep bass notes and tenor vocals, help determine a system's ability to track male voices in particular, without sounding congested. The song also helps with uncovering hidden details and the relative dynamics a speaker is capable of. Using both types of content -- movies and music -- I then grade the sound quality of each soundbar. I evaluate characteristics such as speech clarity, dynamics/volume, bass response and musical playback.  My reviews also account for things like features, design and value. Here's a quick breakdown of our testing categories for more details on what I'm looking for: Subrating CategoryWeightWhat we looked for Design 25%Assessment of build quality, aesthetics, size relative to TVs, remote functionality, display readability, and placement flexibility (wall-mountable, low profile, etc.).Features 25%Evaluation of audio format support, connectivity options, wireless capabilities, room calibration, voice assistant integration, and specialized modes like night listening or dialogue enhancement.Sound 25%Overall audio performance across movies, music, and games. We test clarity, bass response, maximum volume without distortion, and surround sound accuracy in various room sizes.Value 25%Analysis of overall performance and features relative to price point compared with similar models in the same category. Higher-priced models must deliver proportionally better experiences.
Other soundbars we've tested
JBL Bar 500 ($600): Alongside Klipsch, JBL has long had a reputation for being a rock 'n' roll brand with a big sound and even bigger cabinets. During my tests, the JBL Bar 500 fulfilled both parts of the brief by pairing excellent sound with one of the largest subwoofers I've ever seen with a soundbar. Yet, while it includes both HDMI and networked music streaming, the JBL is missing Dolby Atmos height speakers -- which is disappointing for the price. You can save yourself a lot of money by getting the even bigger-sounding Klipsch Cinema 400 instead. Polk Signa S3 ($300): If you're looking for a speaker that can do music as well as play the latest episode of The Last of Us, then the Polk Audio Signa S3 has a lot to offer. It's great for accessing streaming services, as it has Chromecast built-in in addition to Bluetooth and an HDMI input. Read my Polk Signa S3 review.Sony HT-S2000 ($298): Better in some ways than the competition and worse in others, the Sony HT-S2000 boasts a better bass response than the Sonos Beam. For its original price of $500, it missed a lot of the features of its single-bar competition, namely Dolby Atmos compatibility and Wi-Fi streaming. It can now be found on sale for closer to $300. See how it stacks up against the Sonos Beam in our Sony HT-S2000 Soundbar vs. Sonos Beam review. Zvox SB500 ($400): If you're looking for a single audio bar that's even cheaper than the Sonos Arc, the Zvox SB500 is a great option for people who still prize sound quality. This speaker offers multiple sound mode options, tighter bass and better sound than most other single-speaker options. While it may lack the Sonos' Wi-Fi streaming, the Zvox still includes Bluetooth connectivity for streaming audio from your phone or tablet. Read the Zvox SB500 review.  Soundbar FAQ
HDMI vs. optical: Which connections do I want?
Depending on the age of your TV, there are two main ways to output to a soundbar: Digital optical and HDMI. Both HDMI and optical pass digital audio from your TV to your soundbar. Both are better than analog (the red and white cables, or RCA). Both can pass multi-channel audio, like Dolby Digital. Both cables can be had pretty cheap.The biggest difference is that HDMI can pass higher-resolution audio, including the formats found on streaming services such as Dolby Atmos and DTS HD Master Audio. These formats can't be transmitted across optical.The bottom line? Use HDMI when you can. The cables are cheap, and having just one wire simplifies setup. If you can't, optical is fine. If your TV or soundbar doesn't have HDMI, it can't take advantage of the high-resolution audio formats from streaming services anyway. On the other hand Dolby Digital is surprisingly good, and unless you have decent gear, you probably won't hear much (if any) improvement with Dolby Atmos and DTS HD MA.Before you buy a soundbar, make sure it accepts the same connections that exist on your TV. The most common input on soundbars is now HDMI-ARC, and if your TV is less than five years old it should be compatible, but it's worth double-checking.

Do I need Bluetooth or Wi-Fi on my soundbar?
If you plan on playing music through your soundbar, wireless streaming through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi is a must-have. Wireless streaming lets you play music from a multitude of sources -- like Spotify on your phone, or iTunes on your computer -- via your soundbar. Higher-end soundbars usually have both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth streaming, but most budget and mid-range options have one or the other.Bluetooth is the easiest way to wirelessly stream audio to your soundbar. It works with the music stored on your device and any music app, plus it's platform-agnostic -- virtually all iOS, Android and Windows phones and tablets have built-in Bluetooth. Likewise, almost every soundbar on the market features Bluetooth, and if it doesn't you can buy an adapter like those made by Belkin or Logitech. Still, Wi-Fi offers several upgrades to Bluetooth including the ability to listen in multiple rooms and even control it with Google Assistant or Alexa. Wi-Fi streaming generally sounds better, too, as its higher bandwidth allows for uncompressed audio (unlike Bluetooth). That said, most people won't notice a difference in most situations.So, if you prioritize convenience and quick connections from multiple devices, Bluetooth works well. But if sound quality is your primary concern, Wi-Fi streaming is generally superior.

Do I need separate speakers with my soundbar?
If you're looking for the simplest possible solution to improving TV sound, a stand-alone soundbar is the perfect place to start. If you're serious about sound quality though, adding separate speakers to your soundbar is the best way to go. You can mix and match according to your needs, and it's easier to upgrade once new formats come in -- you won't need to replace everything if you want to add 8K video capability, for example. Many retailers offer a soundbar-subwoofer bundle to jumpstart your speaker setup.
If you're not ready to upgrade to a full speaker system just yet, look for a soundbar with several HDMI ports. That way you can connect additional speakers to the soundbar when you're ready.We have a full piece designed to help you pick between a soundbar and speaker system, if you need a bit more help. Whichever option you choose, you will never be able to go back to tinny, little TV speakers ever again.
