What to Consider
Picture quality
Consider contrast ratio and brightness. A projector with a great contrast ratio will look better than a brighter projector, though the latter will perform better if you want to watch with some lights on.
Features
The most handy features you can opt for are lens shift and zoom, which make a projector easier to setup.
Budget
Expect to pay around $1,000 for a quality projector, though models do start around $100.
Specifications
Though important, many companies tend to inflate contrast and brightness specifications. Use them only as a rough guide.

Want a bigger image than even the best TV? Want something wall-size, either inside or outside, for the ultimate movie night? A projector is one of the cheapest ways to get an enormous image. Modern projectors are bright and compact, and many have 4K resolution. Most have streaming built in, so you can watch Disney, Netflix or anything else on them. Imagine games from a PlayStation or Xbox with life-sized characters. That's what the best projectors can create. Whether you want an amazing home theater or to host your own backyard movie night, most projectors are easy to set up and only require a power cable and some Wi-Fi. Here are the best projectors we've tested for every situation. Our Picks

8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Superb overall picture quality
Excellent contrast ratio
Motorized lens
Ample lens shift and motorized zoom
Cons
Huge
Expensive
Still uses replaceable lamps
Why I like it:The Epson Home Cinema 5050UB is the best all-around home projector we've reviewed and if you want to transform your living room into a home theater, this is the best place to start. It has an excellent contrast ratio, paired with impressive brightness and accurate color, all with better detail than what's possible with a 1080p native resolution projector. These all make for one of the best projector's I've reviewed in years. It also has extensive lens shift and zoom options so it will fit in a variety of setups including mounted to the ceiling, on a shelf behind a couch, and so on. Even better, the adjustments are motorized, so you can have a 2.35:1 screen and with the press of a button zoom out to fill it or zoom in to just fill the central 16x9 portion for TV shows. It still uses lamps, however. If that's a dealbreaker for you check out the Epson LS11000 mentioned below. It's very similar to the 5050 but uses lasers instead of a lamp, which has additional benefits beyond not having to replace lamps.Who is it for:Anyone who wants to transform their living room into a home cinema and wants better image quality than what a less-expensive projector can provide.Who shouldn't buy it:If you just want something for an occasional movie night the 5050 is big, bulky, and wildly overkill. One of the less expensive projectors on this list will do most of what the 5050 does for way less money.  ... Show more

Best projector for bright images
Anker Nebula X1
9.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Ridiculously bright
Impressively quiet
All you need for an epic movie night anywhere
Cons
Brutally expensive
Did I mention it's expensive
Who is this for, exactly?
The Anker Nebula X1 is a high-end, portable projector capable of extreme light output. It's the brightest projector I've ever measured. It's also quiet, has a great contrast ratio and offers vibrant colors. The fact that it's relatively compact and portable (it has a retractable handle) makes this projector a real oddball -- a real oddball, but an impressive one.Why I like it:The X1's performance is exemplary. It's extremely bright, so bright that depending on your room or screen, you might need to turn it down. It's not the absolute best-looking projector I've ever tested, but it's up there. That ridiculous light output goes a long way in covering any shortcomings.Who is this for?Anyone who wants a truly massive screen, especially outside.Who shouldn’t buy itThe X1 is extremely expensive for a projector, especially with the wireless speaker package and something that might not be used every day. Other, similarly priced projectors (like the Epson LS11000), offer far easier placement in a wider variety of rooms. Certain people with glasses will also notice color artifacts around white lights on the screen due to the three-laser design. Most people won't have that issue, though.

Best 1080p projector
BenQ HT2060
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent, lifelike color
Decent contrast ratio
The Goldilocks of price and performance
Cons
Brightness is rather average
A little pricey for 1080p
Why I like it:This projector's predecessor, the HT2050A, was one of my favorite projectors for many years. The HT2060 improves on it in most ways, and if your budget is around $1,000 and you have a light-controlled room, this is the projector to get. It creates a fantastic image with excellent contrast and color accuracy. It easily outperforms projectors that cost a lot more. It even has some lens shift to make installation easier in a wider range of rooms. While "only" 1080p resolution, that should be plenty for all but the most resolution-obsessed viewers. Its LEDs will last the life of the projector, so there are no lamps to replace. It's bright enough for most uses but if you need more extreme levels of brightness, check out the Epson HC2350 mentioned below. It doesn't look as good but is far brighter.The HT2060 is our go-to recommendation for most people looking for a projector. It looks great and does just about everything well, especially considering the price.Who is it for:Anyone who wants a great projector at a great price.Who shouldn't buy it:If you want the extra resolution possible with 4K, or want a huge image, there are brighter and higher-resolution projectors on this list that I like almost as much as the HT2060.  ...

BenQ X500i
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent contrast
Accurate colors
Bright
Cons
Expensive
Short throw not for everyone
Why I like it:This is one of my favorite projectors. The image it creates is gorgeous. If you have a smaller room, or when placement behind (or above) a couch isn't possible, this projector's short-throw is an excellent option. It needs just 5 to 6 feet away from a wall or screen to create a 100-inch image, compared with about 10 feet for a non-short throw projector. I like it so much I wish it was more flexible because its image quality is some of the best I've seen in years. It creates a bright, sharp, 4K image with tons of contrast and excellent color. Its image is better than many projectors that cost far more. I wanted to buy one after I reviewed it but alas my theater setup isn't conducive to a short-throw projector.Who is it for:People with smaller rooms, or the ability to mount a projector above where a coffee table would be.Who shouldn't buy it:If coffee table placement, or a ceiling mount above where a coffee table would be, isn't where you want a projector, the X500i isn't for you. Short throw projectors don't work in every room, but if they do work in your room this projector makes a beautiful image.  ... Show more

Best portable projector
Anker Nebula Mars 3 Air
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great size
Google TV streaming
Decent color and contrast for a portable
Cons
A little pricey
Shorter battery life
Outperformed by larger, but still portable, models
Why I like it:If you're looking for a highly-portable projector that can be battery powered but still create a decent image, the Anker Nebula Mars 3 Air does just about everything right. It's my pick for best portable projector, and it creates a relatively bright image, sounds decent, has Google TV built in and is easy to move around and set up. It's a little on the expensive side, but if you're looking for something for the occasional movie night at home or on the go, it does a great job. Who is it for:Anyone who wants something extremely portable (it even has a handle!) for movie nights outside or anywhere a normal projector would fear to tread.Who shouldn't buy it:If you don't need something as easily portable, the BenQ HT2060 (elsewhere on this list) is brighter and looks better overall. It's far larger and more expensive, of course, but still easy to move from room to room.  ... Show more

Best projector with a gimbal mount
JMGO N1S Pro 4K
7.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
High brightness in a small(-ish) projector
Surprisingly good speakers
Basically instant setup
Cons
Colors aren't accurate
The gimbal design is still weird
Outperformed by non-gimbaled alternatives
Why I like it:If you're looking for a projector that can be ready to watch within seconds of plugging it in, a new sub-category of projectors has a pedestal base that both rotates and pivots up and down. This design makes the projector easier to set up compared to non-gimbaled designs, especially handy for portable models. If saving a few minutes of setup is worth the extra cost to you, the JMGO N1S Pro produces a bright, reasonably accurate image. It also sounds good and has built-in Google TV for streaming. It's also quite bright, so it can compete somewhat with room lights, although like any projector, you'll need some curtains for daytime viewing. The short-throw BenQ X500i (mentioned above) will fit better in smaller rooms and create a bigger image from a shorter distance from a wall or screen.Who is it for:Someone who moves and sets up a projector often enough that saving a few minutes each time is worth spending hundreds compared to a non-gimbaled projector.Who shouldn't buy it:The gimbal design doesn't really make economic sense, as much cheaper, non-gimbaled projectors can rotate (just turn it) and pivot (with built-in feet or by propping something under the front). If you only move your projector once in a while, or are willing to spend 2 to 3 minutes setting one up when you do, the JMGO's price premium over other projectors is a waste.  ... Show more

Best budget 4K projector
Epson Home Cinema 2350
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
4K for the cost of 1080p
Compact design
Very bright
Cons
Contrast is pretty mediocre
Loud at max brightness
Technically 4K but other projectors are sharper
Why I like it:The Epson HC2350 is an extremely bright 4K projector at a great price. I'm talking really, really bright. It's one of the brightest projectors I've ever measured. It also has lens shift, built-in streaming and a compact size. It's brighter than the BenQ HT2060 mentioned above, although that projector looks better overall. Unfortunately, its contrast ratio isn't great and is well below average. As a result, its image is more washed out and "flat" compared with some other projectors, notably the aforementioned BenQ. While it is 4K, the HC2350 uses LCDs to create its image so it's susceptible to motion blur. Because of that, it doesn't always look as sharp as you might expect. If you really want 4K and need something with extreme brightness, this is the best option anywhere near $1,000.Who is it for:If you want to create a massive image, like 150-inches diagonal massive, the HC2350 can do it.Who shouldn't buy it:If you want image quality over light output, the HT2060 is a better option.  ...

SCORE
Pros
Excellent price for 4K
Great diminutive size
Reasonably bright
Cons
Colors aren't impressive
Not particularly bright
No zoom
The compact JMGO N1S is a plucky little 4K projector that offers a great alternative to the BenQ HT2060 and Epson HC2350 for those looking for something more portable.Why I like it:The N1S does most things right, including a decent contrast ratio, decent brightness, 4K detail, built-in Google TV and quiet operation. The aforementioned BenQ and Epson look better, but they're also a lot larger. You can pick up the N1S and carry outside, to another room, pretty much anywhere there's WiFi and an AC outlet. It's also one of the cheapest 4K projectors I've reviewed.Who is this for?Anyone who wants a small, easily portable, 4K projector. It even has a handle in the base.Who shouldn’t buy itImage quality is good, but not great. Light output is good, but not great. In picture modes other than Movie, the colors are wildly inaccurate. Which is to say, there are better looking options, but none as small as the N1S.  ... Show more

Anker Nebula Capsule Air
7.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Fun sized
Full version of Google TV
Useful optional accessories
Cons
Not very bright
Not very accurate
Why I like it:The soda can-size Anker Nebula Capsule Air is just about as portable as you can get. It has 720p resolution, built-in Google TV for streaming and a battery that should last for a long movie or several episodes of your favorite TV show. There's even an optional tripod with a battery to extend playtime to 4 hours. However, it's not particularly bright, no projector this size is, but for something pocket-sized for a viewing party just about anywhere (anywhere dark, anyway), it's great. If you don't need that extreme level of portability, the Anker Mars 3 Air elsewhere on this list looks better overall while being a bit larger.Who is it for:Someone who wants an extremely small projector that still looks good.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone who wants an image larger than a small TV or needs to compete with any amount of ambient light.  ...

SCORE
Pros
Highly accurate, lifelike color
Lots of light
Great size
Cons
Contrast ratio is below average
No zoom
Why I like it:The roughly cube-shaped BenQ GP520 is a compact, all-in-one projector with built-in Google TV and lots of light output. Thanks to multiple, optional, stands and mounts, it's easy to place the GP520 either on a low table, high shelf, on the floor facing the ceiling, or mounted on that ceiling facing a wall. It also has extremely accurate color, creating a bright, vibrant image.Who is it for:Someone who wants a projector that can easily sit out of the way when not in use.Who shouldn't buy it:While bright and colorful, the GP520's contrast ratio isn't great. In terms of absolutely image quality, BenQ's own X500i (short throw) or HT2060 (cheaper, better looking, though lower resolution), are likely better options. The older X300G, which the GP520 replaced as a pick in this guide, isn't as bright but has a better contrast ratio. It's mentioned below in the Other Projector's We've Tested section.  ... Show more

Best 4K laser projector
Epson Home Cinema LS11000
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lasers never need to be replaced
Bright and colorful
Very natural looking
Cons
Not as detailed as some 4K DLP projectors
Performance doesn't quite justify the price
Why I like it:The Epson Home Cinema LS11000 is similar to the Epson 5050 but instead of a lamp, it uses a laser and phosphor combo to create light. This means even better color, no lamp replacements, faster turn on/off and a more usable dynamic contrast ratio. A more advanced pixel shift means better resolution than the 5050 as well. The LS11000 is more expensive to start but over the life of the laser projector, they should be about the same. So better picture quality for roughly the same total cost of ownership makes this well worth considering over the 5050. Between the two I'd pick the LS11000, assuming the higher initial price wasn't a major obstacle.Who is it for:Anyone looking for a fantastic home projector and doesn't mind paying a little more up front not to have to replace lamps over the life of the projector.Who shouldn't buy it:It's big and bulky. This isn't a projector for the occasional movie night. This is for transforming a room into a home theater.  ... Show more

Best high-end portable projector
Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K SE
7.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Large but fairly portable
All-in-one streaming machine
Doubles as a BT speaker
Cons
No zoom or lens shift
Light leak halo a bit excessive for the price
Mediocre contrast ratio
Why I like it:The Anker Nebula Cosmos 4K SE is a bit large to be easily portable but it outperforms the smaller, easily portable models. It's a narrow niche, ideal for people who want something capable of a decent image for the occasional movie nights while retaining some semblance of portability thanks to a big handle. In addition to a bright image, it sounds surprisingly good for a projector and can double as a Bluetooth speaker. There's no zoom or lens shift so it's not as ideal for permanent placement as the cheaper (and better looking) BenQ HT2060 or short-throw BenQ X500i (both of which I like better), but for a portable, all-in-one streaming machine, it works really well. Who is it for:Someone who wants something fairly portable but with enough performance to look good creating a big image.Who shouldn't buy it:If you're looking for something to sit in once place and always be ready to go, there are other options on this list that will work better while only being a little less portable.  ...

Geoffrey Morrison/CNETPicture quality: Projectors lag behind TVs in overall picture quality. However, they largely make up for it with absolutely massive images. Want a TV that's 100 inches or more? If you're not ultrarich then only a projector can do that. Even so, there's a wide range of picture quality even among projectors of a similar price. A projector with a great contrast ratio but only average light output is going to look better than the opposite. However, a brighter projector will be easier to see with some lights on and can create an even bigger image. Where are you using it?: For light controlled rooms and home theaters, a projector with a high contrast ratio is better than one that prioritizes light output. For mixed-use rooms where it'll be hard or impossible to totally control the ambient light, or if you want an outdoor movie night with an image the size of the side of your house, one that prioritizes light output will be better, because the contrast ratio won't be as noticeable. What about "X" spec?: Ignore the specs. Companies claim million-to-one contrast ratios, insane brightness ratings and more. But the specs are largely divorced from reality. A claimed 2,000-lumen projector is probably brighter than a 500-lumen projector, but 1,500 and 1,700-lumen projectors are probably the same.How much should you spend?: $1,000 is the sweet spot with projectors, where you can get great picture quality and brightness. Less than that usually requires a compromise of some kind. Some highly portable and battery-powered models are far less. They're not as bright but they're great for their intended use. Spending more gets you incremental improvements. Above $3,000 there's a big jump in picture quality again and from there the sky's the limit. Great picture quality but they're well beyond what we usually test.What features should you look for?: If you're connecting the projector to an audio system (and you should, either receiver/speakers or soundbar), then you don't really need many features in the projector itself. Just get one that has great picture quality and high brightness. Lens shift and zoom are handy if you want more flexibility in placement. If you're looking for some kind of "all-in-one" device with speakers, make sure it has a full version of Android TV inside for streaming, otherwise you'll want to connect a streaming stick like Roku. This is because many highly portable and budget models use the Aptoide store, which won't have as many streaming app options and those it does have often have compromised functionality (no HD, difficult to navigate and so on).  How we test home theater projectors
Geoffrey Morrison/CNETCNET puts projectors through a rigorous and unbiased testing process that's the culmination of more than two decades of projector reviews. We use specialized test equipment, including a Portrait Displays C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Minolta LS-100 luminance meter and an AEMC CA813 illuminance meter. The data is collected and collated by Portrait Displays CalMan Ultimate software, which helps us evaluate every PJ we review. Every lamp-based projector is "burned in" for 50 hours before measuring, and all projectors are initially set up using their most accurate color temp and color modes. Test patterns, sent from a VideoForge Pro 8K, are then used to adjust the various picture settings so the projector looks its best before measurement and evaluation. Contrast ratios are measured in each lamp and iris mode (when available). Once the projectors are fully set up and objectively measured, we watch a variety of content, including TV, movies and games, both with the projector by itself and compared side by side with two direct competitors. Broadly speaking, we're looking for the three picture quality aspects: contrast ratio, overall light output and color reproduction. Contrast ratio is the most important part of any projector's performance. It's the difference between the darkest part of the image and the brightest. While certain TV technologies, like OLED, can create a black that's the actual absence of light, no projector technology can physically do this. As a result, contrast ratios with projectors are far lower. It's the difference between a washed-out and "flat" image and one that's more lifelike and "pops." The better projectors will have a measured contrast ratio in the thousands. Most are between 500 and 1,000:1. Light output is the second most important factor, because it's not only how bright the image appears on your wall but also how big an image you can produce. Most modern projectors are significantly brighter than projectors from even 10 years ago. We measure brightness in candelas per square meter (cd/m2) and then convert them to estimated lumens for ease of comparison. It's important to note that we use the most accurate color temperature mode for our brightness comparisons, but we'll note when a less accurate mode is significantly brighter. Most of the projectors we test are between 1,000 and 2,000 lumens, with battery-powered models far less and some specialized projectors even higher.Color accuracy is the last major factor. No projector can truly take advantage of HDR or wide color gamut, but some can do more than others. Generally, we're satisfied with accurate colors, but adding HDR effects is a bonus. Most home theater projectors we test are fairly accurate. Budget models, which typically prioritize brightness over everything, and PJs from newcomers to the projector space often have wildly inaccurate colors that result in a very unnatural image.Other factors, like video processing and HDR processing, are evaluated in the viewing tests. These are rarely a major factor in projector performance, but some models still use older chips that have issues.The best projector will have a high contrast ratio, high brightness and great color. Those are difficult to do at the same time, but as long as the balance works and the projector looks better than its competitors at a similar price, it's a winner.For more info, check out how CNET tests projectors.*See review for more details**As measured.

BenQ W2720i Geoffrey Morrison/CNETBenQ W2720i: The W2720i has a great design that would blend well into a modern room. Its image quality is decent, but not as good as others we've tested. It's not quite a short throw, but if you can fit a short throw BenQ's X500i performs far better. Read my full review of the BenQ W2720i.BenQ X300G: The X300G is a great projector, with a compact, cube shape and great orange highlights. It was a former pick in this guide due to its excellent contrast ratio. The GP520, mentioned above, is a better choice for most people due to its greater light output. If you can find the X300G on sale for less than the GP520, it's still a great option.Epson EpiqVision Mini EF21: The small EF21, and its gimbaled sibling the EF22, are roughly the size of a toaster and look decent. For the level of performance they're pricey, but can often be found cheaper. Check out our full review of the Epson EpiqVision Mini EF21.Xgimi Horizon Ultra: The Horizon Ultra (image above) has a stylish design and is capable of an extremely bright image. However, its contrast ratio is quite poor. Check out our review of the Xgimi Horizon Ultra.Xgimi Horizon S Max: Similar to the Horizon Ultra, the S Max improves on the Ultra's contrast ratio but drops the optical zoom for a gimbaled design. Not an upgrade that the price suggests, but more a side-step.Optoma GT2100HDR: The GT2100HDR is a bright short-throw projector with 1080p resolution. It lacks any zoom and is outclassed by the, admittedly more expensive, BenQ X500i" target="_self. Check out our review of the Optoma GT2100HDR" target="_self.BenQ GS50: The GS50 is a lunch box-size 1080p projector with a built-in battery. You can even use it as a Bluetooth speaker. However, it's dimmer than the Xgimi Halo Plus for similar money, so we recommend that one instead.Samsung Freestyle: The small, cylindrical Freestyle is an interesting idea, but it comes up short. It's about the size of a Bluetooth speaker and in fact can double as one, and the Freestyle can pivot on its stand to project an image at any height on walls and even the ceiling. Its built-in streaming is far better implemented than with most portable projectors. However, it lacks a battery and its performance is average, at best. Worse, its price is a good 50% higher than it should be based on how it looks and performs. Read our Samsung Freestyle review.Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2: Another relatively expensive projector we didn't love, the Xiaomi at least has a gorgeous, Apple-like design going for it. We appreciated the compact size, 1080p resolution and built-in Android TV streaming, but the cons outweigh the pros. It's relatively dim, especially for the price, and it lacks both a built-in battery and compatibility with a USB power source, so it's not truly portable. Read our Xiaomi Mi Smart Projector 2 review. Epson Home Cinema 880: The 880 is one of Epson's less expensive home projectors, but it still puts out a remarkable amount of light. That, and the price, make it tempting. The contrast ratio is terrible, however, so the overall image quality is weak. Read our Epson Home Cinema 880 review.
Geoffrey Morrison/CNETLG HU810PW: The HU810PW is a higher-end, laser-powered projector with 4K resolution that's able to create some lovely, colorful images. It's also quiet and sports an attractive, boxy case. The contrast ratio is quite poor, so it doesn't look nearly as good overall as other projectors in its price range. Read our LG HU810PW review. Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K: Since it has a handle and it's a compact size, the Cosmos Laser 4K is technically portable, but it's hardly mini at more than 10 pounds. There's also no battery, so you'll need to plug it in. It's nice and bright, but the other downsides -- lack of zoom, average overall image quality and a steep price for what you get -- keep it off this list. Read our Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K Projector review. Projector FAQs
What is the best projector for outdoor movies?
If you want to move movie night outdoors, you have a few options. We generally recommend, when possible, using a regular home projector and running an extension cord. Home projectors offer far better, brighter images for the same amount of money or less compared with portable projectors. If you want to go fully cordless, we like the Anker Nebula Capsule 3. It's not very bright, but it's small and convenient.For more options, check out our list of the best outdoor projectors.

What kind of projector should I get?
LCD and Digital Light Processing projectors are the most common technologies. Higher-end projectors often use LCOS, or liquid crystal on silicon, designs. These are marketed as SXRD and DILA. LCOS is superior to LCD and DLP in almost every way, but it's also significantly more expensive. LCD (used almost exclusively by Epson) and DLP both have their strengths and weaknesses. DLP is typically sharper, while LCD often brighter. However, both technologies still offer images which are plenty bright and sharp. It's more down to implementation on a specific model of projector than either technology.

Do you need a screen for a better projector experience?
You can use any flat surface to project your image. However, don't expect any surface to be the best for a projector. Any and all tiny bumps in a wall, for example, will be visible as extra "noise" in the image. If you want the best image quality from your projector, even an inexpensive screen is a far better option. This is because projector screens tend to brighten the image noticeably and create a smooth surface that best shows off your TV program, movie or game.

Should I buy a portable or a home projector?
Portable models are expensive for their performance, but the advantage is they can work where there's no outlet. If you don't plan on ever using the projector away from your house, a traditional projector will be far brighter and can be used outside. Just remember to bring it inside when you're done.
Show more
Which projector has the best picture quality?
The Epson Home Cinema 5050UB boasts the best picture quality of our best projector picks. While certainly not a budget option, the 5050UB offers excellent performance in rooms with ambient light, vibrant color and superior contrast ratio and is a significant step up in image quality over its competitors.
Show more
Can I connect my phone to a projector?
Yes, most projectors can connect to your phone. If you're okay with a few cables, you can connect your device via an adapter or "dongle" to the projector's HDMI or USB inputs. For a wireless connection, you'll need a Bluetooth-enabled projector to pair your phone or tablet. You can also opt for a third-party media box or streaming stick, though these still require an HDMI port. Either way, displaying your phone on the big screen is easier than ever with modern projectors.

What is a short-throw projector?
A short-throw projector can create a 100-inch image from a distance of just 5 feet, while a traditional home projector can create the same size image from around 10 feet. A short throw ks especially helpful in narrower or smaller rooms where it may be hard to get a traditional projector far enough away to create the desired image size. The projected image can also be extremely bright -- even in rooms with more ambient light. With the promise of simple installations and impressive brightness specs, short-throw projectors are an excellent option for those looking to improve their home viewing experience without the hassle.
Show more
What's an ultra-short throw projector?
Regular projectors can create a 100-inch image from around 10 feet away. Short throw, about 5 feet. An ultra-short throw only needs a few inches. These wide, squat projectors, often called "laser TVs" are one of the latest heavily marketed trends in the projector category. They are extremely expensive for their performance, and unlike the marketing, can't compete with ambient light unless paired with an expensive specialty screen. While they seem an easy solution to a complex setup with a traditional projector, that's misleading as well. Given their cost, complexity and misleading marketing hype, we recommend regular and non-ultra-short-throw projectors for most people.
