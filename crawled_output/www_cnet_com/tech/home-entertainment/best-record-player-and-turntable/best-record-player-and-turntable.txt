How we test
What to consider
Design
There are four main elements to a turntable: the plinth or base, the platter on which the vinyl record sits, the motor and the arm. The best designs offer extended bracing and isolation between each of these elements to reduce the noise, which can affect the sound quality of vinyl.
Cartridge
The best turntables feature a user-replaceable cartridge, which allows you to experiment with a higher-quality cartridge (such as an Ortofon 2M Red).
Price
Turntables start at around $50 and can cost as much as a mortgage payment, but the really good ones start at around $300. Audiophile-quality models start from $1,000.
Belt or direct drive
Direct drive is almost exclusively used by DJs — in turntables such as the Technics SL1200 — whereas belt driven models are consumer-focused.
Pre-amp
Unlike most types of players, a turntable needs a pre-amp to bring music up to “line level”. Otherwise it sounds like pixies singing in a cave. Some models offer a switchable onboard preamp which can enable you to use a better phono stage down the road.
Speed switch
If you play a lot of singles or own audiophile pressings then you will likely want a hardware switch to choose between 33 1/3 and 45. Instead, some models require you to remove the platter and move the belt to change speeds.

Compare
Back to selection
There's nothing that compares with the immediate sound of a record player, and the booming sales of vinyl are a testament to the format's longevity. I've rounded up the best record players I have tested side-by-side in the CNET audio lab in downtown Manhattan, and taken into account popular features such as Bluetooth connectivity and phono preamps. If you're looking to purchase a new player, whether as a first-time buyer, an audiophile or as a vinyl collector, these are the best turntables you can buy right now, suitable for most budgets.

Fluance RT82
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
It's user-friendly
Beautiful looking and well-constructed
It features great sound quality
Cons
There's no onboard preamp
What makes it stand out:The Fluance RT82 offers everything you could want except an onboard preamp, so if you have a receiver or amplifier with a dedicated phono input, this is the model to get. I was mightily impressed by the Fluance's well thought-out inclusions. Auto-start on/off, adjustable feet and even a little bubble-level were included. This high-quality turntable had one of the most entertaining sounds I have heard of anything near the price, with plenty of insight into recordings as well as a healthy bass kick. It comes in black, white and a walnut wood finishPerfect for these listeners:The Fluance looks, feels and sounds like a "proper" turntable, and was the best sounding in a comparison between other $300 turntables including the Music Hall MMF-1.3 and the Orbit Plus. This recordshould appeal to people who don't want to pay through the nose for a quality unit. It's an ideal step-up from suitcase-style portable players or the entry-level Audio-Technicas.Consider alternatives if:While the Fluance RT82 breaks the "you get what you pay for" homily fairly convincingly, it's still possible to pay more for an even better player. This model needs a preamp and, while you can pay extra for one, some other models such as the Audio Technica AT-LP70X include switchable preamps making them more flexible.  ... Show more

Best automatic turntable
Audio-Technica AT-LP70X
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
This turntable is a big sonic step up from the LP60
It has an upgradable stylus
It features automatic operation
Cons
The turntable has a plastic construction
What makes it stand out:With a high degree of usability, a refreshed look and engaging sonics, the Audio-Technica AT-LP70X is the turntable I recommend you want both great sound and automatic operation. I found the AT-LP70X sounds so much better than the budget AT-LP60X, so if you're choosing between the two it's worth paying the extra $80 for the LP70X. The model comes in black with two finish options: bronze and silver. Perfect for these listeners:With its push-button operation, the AT-LP70 is great for beginners as well as people who don't want to fuss around with lifting tonearms into the groove. It may also appeal to people who have an eye to decor-friendly audio components.Consider alternatives if:At its new price of $279, the AT-LP70X is very close in price to the Editor's Choice-winning Fluance RT82. If you don't need automatic operation, then the reassuringly solid, and more upgradable, Fluance will probably serve you better in the long run than the plastic construction of the AT-LP70X.  ...

/10
SCORE
Pros
It's easy to setup and use
It has a choice of line level or phono output
Sound quality is warm and bass rich
Affordable yet surprisingly feature-rich
Cons
It has a plastic construction
Other turntables offer more detail
What makes it stand out:After extensive testing, I found the Audio-Technica AT-LP60X to be a one-stop shop for budding enthusiasts with fully automatic operation and defeatable preamp. The latter means it offers is a basic upgrade path as the choice of line or phono output allows you to add your own preamp. This AT-LP60X is a great value and comes in black with three finish options: solid black, silver or brown. Perfect for these listeners:If you're just starting out in vinyl or looking for a cheap turntable to give as a gift, the relatively inexpensive Audio-Technica AT-LP60X belt-driven turntable offers the warm sound you've heard about.Consider alternatives if:While this turntable is a huge step-up from portable Crosley turntables it's still pipped for sound quality by its even-better stablemate, the AT-LP70X, as well as most of the others on this list.

Pro-Ject T1
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
The T1 offers a refined sound
Great design and a choice of colors
It has an onboard preamp
Cons
The unit's ergonomics aren't the best
What makes it stand out:The Pro-Ject may be pricier than my main pick, but it shows how spending a little more can reap benefits. In terms of sound quality, it really can bring out the best in your records. It offers refined treble, an expansive, detailed midrange and supple bass. It looks lovely, too, with its glass platter -- second only in appearance to the Audio-Technica AT-LPW40WN (but the Pro-Ject sounds better). It comes in several wood finishes as well as black and white. Though it has been replaced by the slightly more expensive T1 Evo, there are still some T1 models available. Perfect for these listeners:The Pro-Ject T1 offers a compelling blend of attractive looks and revealing sonics, making it one of the most affordable "lifestyle" turntables.
Consider alternatives if:The T1's only "problem" is that it's ergonomically awkward -- the switch is deep on the left-hand side instead of on the front, and you need to apply a bit of upward force to remove the tonearm from the rest.  ... Show more

8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
The Debut Carbon Evo boasts excellent sound quality
It's easy to setup
It's a great looking table
Cons
It's not suited to the acrylic platter upgrade
Awkward tonearm rest hampers usability
What makes it stand out:The Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo offers everything you want in a player for the money: the best sound quality of turntables under the $600 mark, ease of setup and use and striking looks. You would have to spend twice as much on another brand (*cough* Rega) to get better sound. It comes in several colors including red (pictured below), steel blue, yellow, fir green and a walnut wood finish. It has been replaced by the Debut Carbon Evo 2 (below), but that turntable is $200 more.Perfect for these listeners:If your budget is between $500 and $600 then the Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo is the turntable I would recommend. Consider alternatives if:At this price, the Debut Carbon Evo starting to get into "Rega territory" but Pro-Ject's usability isn't quite up with there with the Planar turntables of the world. If ergonomics and upgradability are important you may want to consider the P1 or P2 (on sale) .  ... Show more

U-Turn Orbit Theory is available in walnut or ebony U-Turn
Best turntable under $1,000
U-Turn Orbit Theory
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
The U-Turn Orbit Theory has great features and is great sounding
It's not as uncomfortably trebly as the competition
Cons
None to speak of
What makes it stand out:The Orbit Theory may look similar to the Orbit Plus, but this is a vastly superior turntable. Seemingly every component has been upgraded -- from a hardwood plinth to a solid magnesium tonearm -- and U-Turn charges handsomely for these improvements at $999. The model has adjustable feet, speed control, a nifty tonearm lift and almost everything is preinstalled at the factory. While the package also comes with a felt mat, I found it sounded better without. Placing the record directly on the acrylic platter is also hella cool. It comes in three different wood finishes: oak, ebonized oak and walnut. I listened to the Orbit Theory against my reference Rega Planar 3 with a Goldring E3 cartridge, and the Orbit performed surprisingly well. Sound quality was helped enormously by the Ortofon 2M Blue, which exhibited the same sound signature I'd heard before on the Fluance RT-85 and the Project Debut Pro. Only here, with the Orbit Theory, was the brightness better kept in check. Bass was deep and tight, the midrange expressive and detailed, while there was still that treble forwardness that people often associate with digital. The model I received had the optional (and defeatable) $70 phono amp onboard. If you don't have a preamp of your own, it sounds pretty good, though upgrading will pay dividends with better bass.While the cheaper Orbit Plus was a fairly average model for the money, I was impressed with the company's newest model. So impressed that the supercharged Orbit Theory is now my favorite turntable under $1,000. Perfect for these listeners:The Orbit Theory has a smooth, fun sound and should appeal to people looking for a mix of both "analog" warmth and "digital" detail. If you want to buy American-made, the new arm tube is manufactured here while the player is fully assembled in the US. Consider alternatives if:The Orbit incorporates almost every "must have" feature, but it doesn't include automatic operation. But, then again, almost no models at the price do.

Best record player over $1,000
Rega Planar 3
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
It's one of the most beautiful looking turntables available
It features a great tonearm
Sound quality is rich and detailed
Cons
It has no automatic features
There's no preamp option
What makes it stand out:Rega has made turntables for over 40 years and was the first to develop the lightweight plinth (or base) that's now seen in most modern turntables. Even at $1,125 or more, the Planar 3 sits just in the middle of the company's range, but it's arguably the best value. It's also a thing of elegance, with a simple-to-set-up design and the beautiful RB330 tonearm (if you're into that sort of thing). With the right cartridge, the Rega Planar 3 offers an exciting, fun sound, while also looking great and just being a complete blast to use. It is highly recommended. Note that the Rega comes in a number of configurations, such as without a cartridge ($1,125), with the Ortofon 2M ($1,364) or with the Rega Elys ($1,395). If you get the bare table, you can choose whichever cartridge you want. A good dealer will fix one without charging extra installation fees.Perfect for these listeners:The Rega Planar 3 is a tactile player, and it's suited to people who literally want a more analog experience. Plus, it just sounds great. If you're a tweaker you can customize almost every part with a wide selection of third-party upgrades. Consider alternatives if:There are literally thousands of different turntables available at every imaginable price, and the Rega Planar won't be the right fit for everybody. Serious audiophiles may look to something even more exotic, while bargain hunters will likely shop in the "$300 or less aisle."  ... Show more

No analog headphone output or speaker onboard
What makes it stand out:Forget the suitcases. If you want a portable player then you're going to have to think more laterally. This is one of the most eye-catching turntables you will ever see -- it's a handheld case...thing that plays records. This updated version of Audio Technica's original (and much emulated) "Sound Burger" offers all of today's mod cons including USB-C charging and Bluetooth connectivity. I found that pairing a set of headphones was easy enough -- holding down the Bluetooth button on both the turntable and a pair of Bowers and Wilkins P7 headphones connected the two straight away. The turntable has a 33/45 button and the rubber tonearm rest doubles as a 45 adaptor. Sound quality was better than expected, with plenty of bass from M/A/A/R/S' Pump Up the Volume as well as a decent midrange and some treble sparkle.Perfect for these listeners:If you're a crate digger, having one of these swinging from your belt could prove to be invaluable. It's quite the conversation starter as well. And if you have a Bluetooth speaker handy, it could power a decent party -- provided your friends treat the unit with care.Consider alternatives if:Turntables are delicate affairs as is, with their precious stylus tips, but the Sound Burger dials the fragility to 11. It's all manual operation and it's easy to miscue the record if you're not watching, and if you don't push the tonearm back enough, it can dangle in free space between records, making it prone to knocks. Also, you need to lie the player flat for playback, so you may need to rethink those daydreams of jogging or even commuting with one of these. If you're a purist, then the lack of a wired headphone out or onboard speaker may be a deal breaker -- it's line-out only.  ... Show more

Add to compareWhat is the best record player overall?
Based on my hours of testing and comparisons between models at every level, the best turntable for most people is the Fluance RT82 ($299). It offers excellent design, killer old-school looks and great sound quality for the money. But if you're looking to spend a lot more than that, the best turntable I've tested is the U-Turn Orbit Theory. It offers superlative sound quality and looks every bit the premium model it is. If a budget model is what you seek, you could start with something like theBest record players compared

Factors to consider when choosing a record player
The Audio-Technica offers a carbon-fiber tonearm. Sarah Tew/CNETDesignThere are four main elements to a turntable: the plinth (or base), the platter on which the vinyl record sits, the motor and the arm. The best designs offer extended bracing and isolation between each of these elements to reduce the noise, which can affect the sound quality of the vinyl.
MotorGenerally, modern record players are powered in one of two different ways: belt drive and direct drive. Direct drive has a dedicated motor that spins the platter directly, and this design is almost exclusively used by DJs -- in turntables such as the Technics SL1200. Belt drive models are more consumer-focused and use a motor-driven rubber belt to spin the platter. Belt drive is designed to reduce the noise over direct-drive designs by absorbing motor vibrations which could otherwise be picked up by the stylus. All of the record players in this list offer a belt drive. CartridgeA cartridge is the small "box" mounted to the end of the tonearm on your record player. It includes the stylus (or needle) that lowers onto the vinyl itself. The best turntables feature a user-replaceable cartridge, which allows you to experiment with a higher-quality cartridge (such as an Ortofon 2M Red) to produce a better sound.Speed switchAnother convenience feature to look for include an electronic speed switch which means no more removing the platter to change speeds. If you play a lot of singles, or own audiophile pressings. then you will likely want a hardware switch to choose between 33 1/3 and 45. PreampA switchable, onboard preamp that enables you to use a better phono stage. Unlike most types of players, a turntable needs a preamp to bring music up to “line level." Otherwise it will sound like pixies singing in a cave. External preamps are generally required for some vintage models as well as intermediate and high-end turntables that sell at a higher price. If you're looking to keep costs low and convenience high, you may want to consider a turntable with a built-in preamp that then connects to any speaker or receiver. CNET contributor Steve Guttenberg recommends the $100 Schiit Mani phono preamp as a quality budget option.
Additional featuresMany modern record players come equipped with features including Bluetooth pairing and USB connectivity. PriceTurntables start at around $50 and can cost as much as a mortgage payment, but the good ones start at around $300. Audiophile-quality models start from $1,000. This list contains plenty of options, including budget models, to help you stay within your budget. How CNET tests record players
The CNET Audio Lab in downtown Manhattan where I test turntables, soundbars, and AV receivers side-by-side Ty PendleburyI test all of the turntables side-by-side in the CNET lab with models which have an equivalent price and feature count. Though some of the models on test have a preamp onboard, I used the phono-level output on each -- this output features an unamplified signal and needs an preamp with RIAA equalization. I tested the turntables using a combination of gear including a Rotel RA1592 amplifier, Onkyo TX-NR696 and TX-RZ50,  Q Acoustics 3050i tower speakers, and the Cambridge Audio Duo preamp.As part of the tests listened to a number of different albums including these four artists: Bob Marley, Slint, LCD Soundsystem and Miles Davis. On each turntable, I listened for bass response (was it boomy or clean?), midrange detail (low-level instruments and echo effects) and high frequencies (were they recessed or too loud?). The best turntables performed well across all genres.
Two of the models offered a switchable line-level output -- the Music Hall MMF-1.3 and the Audio-Technica AT-LPW40WN -- and this is handy if you don't have or don't want an external preamp. You can plug these models into anything that accepts RCA connectos. I also plugged these two directly into the amplifier and compared them against each other.
It's worth noting that some of the models are unavailable outside North America, such as the Crosley C10A, Music Hall MMF-1.3, Fluance RT82 and the U-Turn Orbit Plus. If you're looking for the best alternative to the Fluance RT82, I would recommend the Pro-Ject T1.
Other record players I've tested
Most of the turntable models I've tested for this buyer's guide have at least something to recommend them -- whether it be design, sound quality or both. The following are ranked in order of commendability.
Cambridge Audio Alva ST ($599) Ty Pendlebury/CNETCambridge Audio Alva ST ($699): It's a close call between the Cambridge Audio and the Pro-Ject Debut Evo and it's only sound quality that separates the two. The Alva ST is loaded with features and is a more enjoyable deck to use, but the Pro-Ject has a shade more subtlety and detail in its performance. Still at the price, this Cambridge Audio is a great turntable.Crosley C10A ($268): You may know the brand for its suitcase players, but Crosley's C10A is an excellent hi-fi component. This vinyl record player sounds good and looks great. I don't like it quite as much as the Fluance but at $268, it's a bargain.Music Hall MMF-1.3 ($349): The Music Hall MMF-1.3 is a good turntable at a decent price. It has an even-handed response with all types of music but it wasn't as engaging as the Fluance RT82. If you're looking to plug a turntable straight into any receiver without a phono preamp, this is the model I'd opt for.Fluance RT85 ($500): Unless you have a mellow-sounding system, the Fluance RT85's combination of an Ortofon 2M Blue and acrylic platter seems like one upgrade too far. The RT85 will be too much for already bright systems and the Pro-Ject T1 and Debut Evo are a better value at this level.Audio-Technica AT-LPW40WN ($499): With its carbon-fiber tonearm and natural wood veneer plinth, the Audio-Technica features excellent design, but it's a mixed bag in terms of sound quality. The table sounded boomy when plugged into a phono preamplifier, and while it was more neutral with the onboard preamp, it was still a little ho-hum.
The $799 Pro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo 2
Ty Pendlebury?cnetPro-Ject Debut Carbon Evo 2 ($799) : Not really a sequel to the original Evo as much as a brand new franchise. While it's better-sounding and the platter is improved, it's $200 more than before and not as recommendable.Victrola Stream Carbon ($799): The first turntable to work wirelessly with Sonos, the Victrola Stream Carbon is easy to set up and play on any compatible speaker. The turntable's a lot of fun and the sound quality was fine enough, but sadly the ergonomics were a little off. Specifically, the two components you use every time -- the power-speed switch and the tonearm lift -- are almost comically tiny. Read my Victrola Stream Carbon first take.Monolith by Monoprice Belt Drive Turntable ($199): The Monolith turntable offers a lot for the money including a USB connection and a Bluetooth output. It sounds great and it definitely looks the part. However, turntable setup is a pain, and I've experienced some problems such as extreme speed fluctuations.
The $329 U-Turn Orbit Plus. Sarah Tew/CNETU-Turn Orbit Plus ($399): While it's better-sounding than the original, the U-Turn couldn't compete with the performance of other players around $300. The turntable sounded truncated with a lack of extended high frequencies, and on the hardware side, the lack of a cue lever felt like a glaring omission.Crosley Cruiser Deluxe (around $80, depending on color): The "suitcase-style" portable turntable is hyper popular due to its combination of eye-catching design and cheap pricing. The Deluxe has a plethora of features, including Bluetooth in/out plus RCA out, but some compromises have been made, including a cheaper stylus. It's a fun toy, but in the end it's the Crosley's poor sound quality which disappoints. The Victrola Eastwood (below) sounds better, but it has its own issues.Victrola Eastwood ($90): Unlike the competitive Crosley Cruiser Deluxe, the Victrola offers a proper cartridge (no plastic moving parts here) and compact styling. While it also sounds better than its competitor, the Eastwood's main problem is that the lid gets in the way when you try to change records, which could lead to damaging your vinyl.

Is vinyl better than digital?
Music fans have been debating the differences between digital and analog since the introduction of CD in the early '80s. There is no true "winner," as both have their respective strengths. Digital offers ease of use, portability and should sound the same on Day 1 as it does on Day 10,000. Vinyl offers a fuller, richer sound and it's also more fun thanks to its tactile nature. Many people have collections which encompass several formats: streaming, CDs, vinyl records and even cassettes.

Can I leave the dust cover on when playing records?
It's worth noting that all of the models I tested come with a dust cover, but in every instance bar the "suitcase" I used them with the lid off. While every other aspect of a turntable is damped, the dust cover usually is not. It's a simple piece of plastic designed to keep dust off your vinyl while not playing music. If left on, it can cause feedback when the volume is up loud enough. It's best to remove the cover before playing a record: Players look and sound better that way.

How much should I spend for a good record player?
While you can spend extravagant amounts on a turntable, the true sweet spot for a record player is around $300. The best models at this price are not simple toys and can be considered true hi-fi. They offer elevated vinyl record sound quality and high-quality components. Unlike cheaper players, spending a bit more on these models will buy you a turntable that's built to last.

Do suitcase turntables ruin records?
While a turntable like the Pro-Ject Debut Pro could be considered a serious piece of hi-fi, suitcase models like the Crosley Cruiser Deluxe are essentially toys. That's OK, and as long as you treat them as such you shouldn't run into any problems. Whether turntables like this will destroy your records, though, is hotly contested, but the moving parts can be of a fairly basic quality. For example, the stylus on our Cruiser review unit was a chunky plastic/ceramic combo instead of the aluminum/diamond you'd see on almost any other turntable. The stylus itself was also quite large, which could lead to greater wear, and when plugged into a separate hi-fi the player sounded like an AM radio.The other factor that could lead to damage is that it is typically children who use these suitcase record players, and they aren't as careful with their records as experienced users. While we know people who've used suitcase models without issue, it is worth paying a bit more for a player like the Audio Technica LP60, which offers superior build quality and also sounds better.
