How we test
What to consider
Price
TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality.
Screen size
Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best.
Capability
Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality.

FAQ on Best TVs of 2025
There are a bunch of 2025 televisions now available in stores, and I've reviewed a good deal of them, but even so, some of the recommendations below debuted last year. This is because TVs are a stable technology, and year-to-year improvements are usually minor, which means in some cases you can buy a similar TV to a 2025 model, but for half the price. That said, here are the best TVs you can buy now, from high-end QLED and OLED TVs to midrange mini-LED and cheap 4K smart TVs.These are the best TVs for 2025

Best TV for picture quality in 2025
Samsung S95F
8.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Best overall image quality I've tested
Best-in-class glare reduction in a bright room
Superior contrast and off-angle viewing
Ultrathin panel with external input box
Cons
Expensive
Slightly diminished contrast in bright rooms
If you want the best TV you can buy in 2025, this is it. Samsung's S95F takes everything we loved about last year's S95D -- great picture quality, super-fast gaming, superior anti-glare -- and somehow manages to improve upon it. What's especially impressive is how good this TV is at banishing reflections, which makes it well-suited to watching in a bright room. If you find yourself squinting at the screen because you can see a window or overhead lights in your picture, this TV is for you. While there is some loss of contrast with the lights on, it's not as pronounced as with the S95D, and its overall lack of reflectivity is well worth the trade-off.Picture quality is just as great as you'd expect from an OLED, with vivid colors and fantastic contrast. The TV has also had a brightness boost in 2025 of around 30 percent and can go toe-to-toe with the even-brighter (on paper, at least) LG G5.The only downside? It costs a lot of money. Yet, as Samsung's flagship OLED, the S95F makes your investment worthwhile -- and rewards movie fans and gamers alike with excellent performance in an attractive package.

Brightest OLED TV of 2025
LG OLED G5
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
The G5 has the highest brightness of any OLED TV yet
It's capable of stunning image quality
Cons
Brightness boost is not visible in all content
Remote is not as good as previous versions
Expensive compared to LG C4
While every other OLED TV until now has shown modest increases year-over-year, the LG G5 is a massive improvement on its predecessor. LG says it has a 40% improvement in brightness -- and I verified this through my own testing -- and it's a TV that can take on LCD TVs for its clarity and punch. The G5 has better color than the company's own C5, and it's a lot better for gaming, too. For the right person, the extra $600 or so for the G5 over the C5 is well worth it.With its high brightness the G5 is also great for use in a lit room, though it's second to the excellent Samsung S95F, in my testing, in terms of reducing glare in a bright room.With excellent brightness, punchy contrast and bold color, the LG G5 is one of the best TVs if you want the best picture possible from a 2025 TV.  ...

Best TV value for 2025
LG OLED C4
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Better picture quality than any non-OLED TV we've tested
Superior contrast and off-angle image
Best-in-class gaming features
Sleek styling with ultralight, thin panel
Cons
Expensive
Not as bright as higher-end OLED TVs
No major improvements over the C3
The C4 may be a 2024 TV, but it is the best TV you can buy right now for number of reasons: namely, it has better picture quality than any LCD TV on this list, including the TCL QM8, and it's currently selling for the same price as a mid-range LCD TV. As I found in my measurements, the C4 has perfect black levels, unbeatable contrast and well-saturated colors. In my comparison tests, its overall brightness isn't quite as impressive as 2025 OLEDs like the C5 and G5, but it's still an incredible performer in all types of room lighting. The C4 is well-suited to almost any kind of content. For example, its fast pixel response times and high saturation make it great for watching sports, as well as making it a superb gaming TV. The C4 demonstrates why it's often better to buy last year's version of a TV. It's very similar to the new C5 and about a grand cheaper in the 65-inch size. As an OLED, the C4 is still more expensive than the cheaper TVs here, so the only reason you wouldn't buy this TV is if you wanted a better "bang for buck." The TCL QM8 or even the Roku Pro Series is a better value.  ... Show more

Best LCD TV of 2025
TCL QM8K
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Great picture quality
Very few haloing artifacts
New Filmmaker mode helps create more accurate pictures
Cons
Still bright, but dimmer than the TV it replaced
Worse input lag with games
TCL has topped CNET's list of the best TVs for the past few years, and the QM8K improves in a few key ways. In my side-by-side comparison tests with both the LG C5 and the Hisense U8K, the TCL stood out with excellent color and OLED-like black levels. The key to the TC's picture-quality performance is mini-LED tech and its new Halo Control System, which is designed to reduce light bleed in dark scenes. It works, though it does mean the screen is a little less bright than the previous QM851.The TV also has a sleek design with a center-mount stand and a spiffy remote control. The operating system is Google TV, which I don't like as much as Roku TV, but it's still a solid smart TV system.Apart from a slightly slower gaming response time -- measured at about 1ms slower than most and 4ms slower than the best -- the main downside of the TCL QM8K is that it's only available in large sizes (65 inches and up). If you're looking for a TV for a smaller space, I recommend the similarly-performing Hisense U8QG instead.

Best TV under $1,000 in 2025
TCL QM6K
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
The TCL QM6K has excellent picture quality
The black levels are surprisingly deep
This TV offers outstanding bang for buck
Cons
The TV's brightness and color saturation could be better
When it comes to the best TVs for the money, it's the TVs priced under a grand typically include the features you want without paying too much. The TCL QM6K started at a grand and is now even cheaper (around $650) and it has those tick boxes already checked -- excellent picture quality, streaming, and gaming. It's an attractive TV with its "bezel-less" design and is simple to put to together and set up.The TV boasts compatibility with all the HDR formats -- including both Dolby Vision and HDR10+ -- and includes the company's Halo Control System processing, which is designed to eliminate backlight haloing in its 500 dimming zones.In my side-by-side tests of the TV I found that it had plenty of contrast compared to its competition, though I had hoped for a lot more oomph in the brightness department -- its 655 nit reading is super low for a modern TV. Yet, if you're watching in the dark, or without direct reflections, its lack of dazzling whites won't be an issue.  ... Show more

Samsung DU7200
7.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Cheap
Excellent black levels and shadow detail
Plenty of streaming options
Cons
Desaturated reds
Interface is less user-friendly than a Roku TV
In terms of the best bang for buck, one of the most impressive models has been the Samsung DU7200 -- it's a TV that delivers a really good picture for an affordable price. The black levels and shadow detail are excellent for the money, and while my test unit looked a little desaturated out of the box, that was easily fixed by adjusting the Color control. The TV has onboard streaming, and the sound quality isn't too bad either. If you're looking for a bedroom unit or a smaller gaming TV then the Samsung DU7200 is the model I would choose. Don't buy it if you're a stickler for image quality, but for the price, it's pretty great.  ... Show more

Aug 21, 2025: Added TCL QM8K as the best LCD TVAug 7, 2025: Added TCL QM6K to best TV under $1,000July 18, 2025: Samsung S95F OLED is now my Editors' Choice for best high-end TV, and added the Samsung S90F and LG C5 to Also tested.July 3, 2025: Updated list with a review of 2025's Samsung S95F, plus the latest pricing. Other TVs I've tested
The Konica Minolta CS-2000 spectroradiometer testing an LG OLED in CNET's lab. David Katzmaier/CNETRoku Pro Series: If you're looking for a gaming TV and don't want to spend the money on an OLED model, the Roku Pro is a solid choice. Read CNET's review of the Roku Pro (2024)Samsung S90F: The Samsung S90F is a fantastic TV with great contrast levels and highly saturated colors, and it's great for gaming, too. Yet it's still more expensive than last year's LG C4 and S90D, and not that much different. Get those instead while they're still available. Read my review of the S90F OLED TVLG C5: Like the S90F, this is an excellent OLED TV for watching TV or playing games. However, at the moment, it's stuck between the much-cheaper LG C4 and the much better, though more expensive, LG G5. Read my review of the LG C5 TV.
The Panasonic Z95A is a 2024 OLED TV which boasts a dedicated audio system. Richard Peterson/CNETPanasonic Z95A: The Panasonic Z95A is a superb TV and it has one advantage over most at the price because of its dedicated speaker system, giving it decent sound quality. The inclusion of Amazon Fire TV is also unusual for the price but I still prefer Google TV. Read CNET's hands-on of the Panasonic Z95A.Samsung S90D: The S90D performed well in our measurement tests but it suffered some contrast loss compared to the C4. Any differences between the C4 and S90D were subtle. Read CNET's full review of the Samsung S90D.Samsung S95D: With a versatile matte screen and awesome picture, the Samsung S95D delivers astounding image quality, and is quite a bit cheaper than the,nbest muscle relaxers albeit better, S95F. Read CNET's full review of the Samsung S95D. How CNET tests TVs
CNET editors David Katzmaier and Ty Pendlebury have been testing TVs since the turn of the century. Sarah Tew/CNETIn every CNET TV review, I compare three or more similar TVs side by side in a dedicated, light-controlled test lab. With each review, I employ a rigorous, unbiased evaluation process that has been honed in more than two decades of TV reviews. I test TVs with a combination of scientific measurements and real-world evaluations of TV, movies and gaming content. To ensure I can evaluate the picture quality of every TV I employ the use of an AVPro Connect 8x8 4K HDR splitter so each one receives the same signal. I test the TVs using various lighting conditions playing different media, including 4K HDR movies and console games, across a variety of test categories, from color to video processing to gaming to HDR.
In order to measure each TV, I use specialized equipment to grade according to light output and color.
My hardware includes a Konica Minolta CS-2000 spectroradiometer and a Murideo Six-G 4K HDR signal generator. I use Portrait Displays CalMan Ultimate software to evaluate every TV I review according to their brightness, black levels and color.My reviews also account for such things as features, design, smart TV performance, connectivity including HDMI inputs and gaming compatibility.

The Sony Bravia 8 II is a new flagship OLED David Katzmaier/CNETWith all of the TVs available today, and all of the technical terms and jargon associated with television technology, it can be tough to figure out what's important. Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion.Picture quality: Broadly speaking, the type of display technology helps dictate how good a TV's picture quality is, but OLED is typically the best display technology, and this is followed by LCD (including QLED, and Mini LED). OLED tends to have the best picture quality because it doesn't need a backlight and every pixel can be either on or off, leading to great black levels. In comparison, each LED in a backlight looks after multiple pixels at a time so it isn't as precise -- it's not yet 1:1. Among midrange models, look for a feature including full-array local dimming, mini-LED and 120Hz refresh rate, which (unlike some other extras) do help improve the picture in my experience. Additionally, If a TV uses Quantum Dots it often leads to better color performance, whether it's an OLED or an LCD.Screen size: Bigger is better in my book. I recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. More so than any "feature," stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money. One of the most common post-TV-purchase complaints I've heard is from people who didn't go big enough. And I rarely hear people complain that their TV is too large. It's worth adding that while TVs can get really big indeed, 4K resolution is sufficient for even the biggest models, and CNET doesn't recommend any 8K TVs as they represent a poor comparative value.Price: TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Most entry-level TVs have a good enough picture for most people, but TVs last a long time, so it might be worth spending more to get a better picture. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall when prices are lower.Sound quality: Every TV has some sort of built-in speaker, but in my twenty years of reviewing AV equipment the sound of modern TVs has been routinely terrible. While I do test the audio on each model, if you are serious about sound quality then buying a separate soundbar (from $100) or home theater system will instantly improve vital aspects such as speech and bass reproduction.Smart TV: Among entry-level TVs the most important feature is what kind of smart TV system the TV uses, and while some are proprietary to each brand (Samsung and LG) some models do offer Roku and Google TV.For more TV buying advice check out How to Buy a TV.
TV brightness according to CNET's testing
One important aspect of image quality I test is overall brightness using the CS-2000 spectroradiometer. Here's how brightness compares in nits across select TVs listed above.Light output in nits

FAQ on Best TVs of 2025
How much should I spend on a TV?
Prices vary widely by size and features, from less than $100 for basic 24-inch TVs to more than $2,000 for big OLED models. TVs last a long time, so we think it's worthwhile to spend a little extra beyond the bare minimum to get a bigger screen, better picture quality or better features. With that in mind, here are some ballpark prices that will get you a very good TV in 2025.55-inch: $70065-inch: $1,00075-inch: $1,300You could pay (much) more or less. The fact is that just about any TV will produce a picture decent enough to satisfy most viewers. Most complaints you read in user reviews aren't about picture quality. Instead, they're about ease of use, smart TV menus or sound (or a broken TV).

What size TV should I buy?
In our opinion bigger is better, and your money is best spent on large screen sizes rather than a slight upgrade in image quality. The answer also depends on room size and seating distance: If you have a big room and sit farther away, you'll want a bigger TV.

Which is better, OLED or LED?
In our reviews, OLED TVs, which use organic light-emitting diode technology, have always had better picture quality than LED TVs, which are essentially LCD TVs that use LED backlights. The main reason is that OLED TVs can produce a perfectly dark shade of black with no stray illumination or blooming, which leads to better contrast and pop. LED TVs can get brighter and usually cost less than OLED TVs.

What is the best smart TV system for streaming?
At CNET, our favorite is Roku for its simplicity, but different systems like Google TV, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung and LG have different strengths, particularly for voice commands. In any case, we don't consider the built-in smart TV system that important because you can always connect a streaming device to any TV.

How do I get the best TV sound?
Most TVs sound terrible because their thin cabinets don't have room for decent-size speakers or a bass. If you want to get good sound, you should buy an external audio system. Even an inexpensive soundbar will deliver much better audio quality than a TV's built-in speakers.
