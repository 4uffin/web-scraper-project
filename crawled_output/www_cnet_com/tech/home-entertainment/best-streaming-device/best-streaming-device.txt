Streaming device FAQ
What is the best streaming device overall? We prefer Roku's content-agnostic approach, ease of use, large app library and excellent search functionality over those from other companies. We've found that the Roku Express 4K Plus is usually the cheapest Roku that offers 4K HDR streaming, and is therefore the best streaming device to buy. The Express 4K Plus lacks Dolby Vision support, but we've found that this usually isn't a deal-breaker, as Dolby Vision only works on some TVs (and notably not Samsung). Additionally, we don't think that Dolby Vision looks any better than regular HDR and isn't generally worth extra money. That said, there are times during the year when the Roku Express 4K Plus is not our top pick. This occurs when the Streaming Stick 4K is on sale and is cheaper than the Express 4K Plus. The Streaming Stick 4K offers all the same functionality of the Express 4K Plus, but includes Dolby Vision support -- which is why it's typically more expensive. We don't think this addition is worth the premium price, but it certainly shouldn't prevent you from grabbing the Streaming Stick 4K if it's the cheaper of the two.

SCORE
Pros
Super simple, app-based menus
Cheaper than 4K HDR rivals
Fast and responsive
Ethernet support (with third-party adapter)
Dolby Atmos supported on some apps
Cons
No Dolby Vision support
Roku's voice assistant remains weaker than rivals from Amazon, Apple and Google
Roku is our favorite streaming system, with the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search. It also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another. The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to the AirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall.  ... Show more

Pros
Robust app and Dolby Vision support

Cons

No support for gaming services
No smart home control
Voice assistant remains limited
Does not support Dolby Atmos
The Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. Along with a stick-like design, Dolby Vision HDR is the main difference between the Streaming Stick 4K and the Express 4K Plus, and is ostensibly why the Streaming Stick 4K is more expensive than its sibling. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Useful remote
Large app selection
Makes excellent use of the Google Assistant
Ties in well with YouTube TV, Google Photos
Cons
Can lag when switching apps or using voice
Assistant doesn't always give the best option to play back content
No full Dolby Atmos
The Chromecast with Google TV 4K isn't quite as good as the Roku Express 4K Plus, but it comes closer than any other device on the market. Chromecast outdoes Roku by adding Dolby Vision compatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world.  ... Show more

Pros
Fast loading times

Cons
Only slightly improved from previous model
Like its predecessor, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2023) loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max offers Wi-Fi 6E and nearly all the latest playback standards, including Dolby Vision. For people hooked into the Amazon ecosystem, the new Ambience mode can include up-to-date delivery information on your TV screen. Though it's only a little better specified than the original Max, the second gen is now officially the best Fire Stick on the market today.  ... Show more

Apple TV 4K (2022)
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Cheaper starting price than previous Apple TV 4K
Speedy performance
Modern, A15 Bionic chip
Robust app and format support, integration with other Apple services
Cons
Still a lot more expensive than rival, capable streamers
No noticeable apps or experiences to take advantage of new chip
TV gaming on Apple Arcade remains lacking
Ethernet is just on the priciest model
The 2022 Apple TV 4K starts at $129, $50 less than its previous version. It also has a faster A15 Bionic processor under the hood and an updated Siri Remote that swaps out the proprietary Lightning connector for USB-C. If those changes sound minor, that's because they are. When using the device, it's hard to see any real difference compared to last year's model. But it continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to use Apple Arcade for gaming or take full advantage of their Apple One subscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate its flexible HDR and TV calibration feature.For most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Compact, easy to set up and affordable
Excellent dialogue reproduction

Cons
Lacks bass in movies and music
Soundbars with streaming onboard may be a relatively recent development, but Roku's new Streambar nails it. It has the Roku interface we know and love, complete with 4K HDR with improved sound for any TV, especially dialog. It's smaller and more affordable than its predecessor, the Roku Smart Soundbar, but we think the new Streambar media streamer device makes more sense for most people.  ... Show more

Sure, it's an expensive media device -- and that's before adding a game controller -- with 8GB of storage and 2GB RAM, compared to 16GB of storage and 3GB RAM, but if you want a jack-of-all-trades video streaming player, the Shield is it. In addition to 4K streaming and HDR, it offers a robust library of games, both console-level and Android TV, Steam Link, built-in Google Assistant complete with smart home control, NAS access, Plex server capability, HD HomeRun integration and much more.  ...

Factors to consider when choosing a streaming device
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a new streaming device. Higher-end devices can cost well over $100, like the Apple TV 4K, the Roku Streambar, and the NVIDIA Shield TV. But if your budget is a little tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective streamers which are priced as low as $30. Brand compatibilityYou'll want to consider the other brands in your home's ecosystem before choosing a product. If you're already an Apple loyalist, you might opt for the Apple TV to round out your supply of iPhones and HomePods. Or, if you're already an Amazon Prime subscriber, the Fire Stick may be your best option. Google and Chrome junkies may prefer to keep it in the family with several Chromecast and Google options to complete their ecosystem. In any case, keeping it "in the family" may be your best bet in terms of picking your streaming device. Use casesConsider what exactly you'll be using your streaming device for. Are you looking for extra streaming services beyond what your TV already offers? Are you looking for a powerful device which you are also able to game on? Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the streaming device you choose. Display hardware and connectivityAsk yourself how you'll be integrating the streaming device into whatever environment you're buying for. Most devices offer both HDMI connectivity and Wi-Fi, though wireless connectivity issues may force some people to use Ethernet, for example. Consider whether you're willing to add wires to your setup to let your streaming device run as smoothly as possible.
How we test streaming devices
Every streaming device we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available on the platform and note how they stack up against the competition. To do this, we hook rival streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences. Our metrics that we look at to rate a device include: hardware design and features, remote capabilities and design, overall platform ease-of-use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance, and the overall speed and reliability of the system.
Sarah Tew/CNET Other streaming devices we've tested
Roku Ultra LT: This is technically the cheapest current device with Roku's streaming system and an Ethernet port. The savings compared to the actual, non-LT Ultra isn't much, however, and it lacks that device's slick extras like Dolby Vision, programmable keys, fast app launching and the remote finder.JubileeTV: JubileeTV's modus operandi is to simplify streaming TV access for aging Americans. With technology constantly advancing and an overwhelming amount of content available, older viewers can feel lost. JubileeTV provides a familiar viewing experience for seniors to enjoy their favorite programming while staying connected to family and loved ones.

The Roku UItra (2024) includes a new remote but it's not an essential upgrade. Josh Goldman/CNETRoku Ultra (2024):
The Roku Ultra (2024) has seen some upgrades including a new caching system for faster loading times and a new voice remote with USB-C charging. If you already have an Ultra, then simply buy the new Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition instead. Read CNET's full review of the Roku Ultra (2024).Fire TV Stick 4K: The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed.Fire TV Stick Lite: The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting the Roku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is the Express Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, learn more about the Fire TV Stick Lite in our full review. Streaming device FAQ
Do streaming devices have monthly fees?
No. Streaming devices themselves do not have any monthly fees. However, channels that you can watch on the streaming devices, like Netflix, HBO Max and Hulu, do require users to pay monthly fees in order to access their content.

Do you need a streaming device with a smart TV?
Not necessarily. Many smart TVs come with their own streaming platform where users can download popular apps like Netflix and Hulu. Samsung's smart TVs offer fairly robust options. Also, TVs now come with more built-in mainstream streaming platforms such as Roku, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV.Problems can arise when your TV's interface lacks some of the content you need. For example, Spectrum users who have an LG smart TV will not be able to find the Spectrum app through LG's platform. Instead, they'll need to pick up a Roku, Apple TV or Google Chromecast in order to stream their cable package. Generally speaking, streaming-centric devices from Roku or Amazon tend to have more available apps than a streaming platform from a TV manufacturer. Of course, as you'll see below, there are some exceptions.

Can I get all the channels I want on any device?
Every streaming device has major streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and Amazon Prime. That said, not all services have access to every streaming channel in existence. Once again, the Spectrum TV app proves illustrative. It is available on most platforms, but is not on any Amazon Fire TV device. It might be a good idea to double check which device has the apps you'll need before making a purchase. Otherwise, you might be in for an unpleasant surprise when you find out that your device doesn't have an app for one of your favorite services.
