What to Consider
Budget
Before anything else, you'll want to consider how much you're willing to spend on a Fire TV Stick. Higher-end models can cost up to $140, but there are plenty of simpler yet still very effective Fire TV Sticks which are priced as low as $20.
Use cases
Consider what exactly you'll be using your Fire TV Stick for and make sure it aligns with the capability of the model you choose.
4K and HDR
Models like the Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick 4K and the 4K Max support and HDR protocols, while the Fire TV Stick Lite and standard Fire TV Stick do not.
Alexa
While all five Fire TV Stick models have Alexa integrations, the Fire TV Cube has some advanced modalities that may better suit your needs.

Amazon has made a big splash in the streaming world with its Fire TV devices, ranging from the straightforward Fire TV Stick Lite to the feature-packed Fire TV Cube. We’ve tested these options (and everything in between) alongside offerings from Roku, Google and Apple. While Roku often wins us over with its easy-to-navigate, neutral platform, Amazon’s Fire TV Sticks shine for Alexa fans and those deep into the Amazon ecosystem. Choosing the right model might seem daunting, but we’ve got you covered. Whether you need something basic or a device that does it all, our guide to the best Fire TV Stick will help you pinpoint exactly what suits your streaming style and needs.  Our Picks

What's the best Fire TV Stick? When looking at all the great options offered by the variety of Fire TV Sticks on the market, we have given our top spot to the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. It launches apps quickly, and navigating around feels fast and smooth, thanks to its robust processor. It also comes with Dolby Vision support and Wi-Fi 6 for faster streaming.

SCORE
Pros
Ambient mode is useful
Excellent picture and sound
Loading times are zippy
Cons
Slightly more expensive
Interface is more crowded than ever
Roku and Google offer better values
If you're looking for the best Fire Stick on the market, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is it. The Max is speedy and loads apps almost immediately, and navigating around the system is swift and smooth. Even better, the Max supports Wi-Fi 6 and nearly all the latest playback standards, including Dolby Vision. The downside to the Max is its Fire TV platform with ads featured prominently throughout. We just don't appreciate the TV becoming a giant rotating billboard for content or ads when in screensaver mode. But this is a good choice for those looking for the best and fastest Amazon Fire TV stick.  ... Show more

Fire TV Stick 4K
Pros
Slightly more affordable
4K streaming
Impressive voice features
Great value
Cons
Not as fast as other models
No Wi-Fi 6 connectivity
User interface pushes Amazon content too aggressively
The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K debuted in 2018 and is still around today. While we generally think it's worth it to upgrade to the Max, the original Fire TV Stick 4K is still a good choice for those who want 4K streaming without paying for the latest bells and whistles, namely Wi-Fi 6 and blazing-fast speed. The voice features are impressive and Echo and Dot owners can control it with Alexa. Its app and game selection is superb and responses are still fast, though not as fast as on the Max. The remote can control volume and power on TVs and soundbars. Ultimately, if the price of the Fire TV Stick 4K is close to the Max, we recommend passing on this and getting the newer and faster Max.  ... Show more

Best budget streamer
Fire TV Stick Lite
Pros
Dirt cheap
Includes Alexa voice remote
Wide range of streaming apps, including Max
Integrates well with Echo speakers
Cons
Voice commands don't work with every app
More complex menus than Roku
HDR without 4K is kind of pointless
The Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite is our favorite budget streaming device, besting the Roku Express. The Lite trounces the Express in features-for-the-money. This Fire TV's biggest advantage is a remote with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. The cheapest Roku with a voice remote is the Express Plus 4K, which uses Roku's more basic voice system, not Alexa. The Fire Stick's remote also doesn't need line of sight to work. If you want to spend as little as possible on a streaming player, the Lite is your best bet.  ... Show more

Best for hands-free Alexa, smart home control
Fire TV Cube
Pros
Sleek design
Speedy processor
4K upscaling
Cons
Smart TV features don't work with every TV manufacturer
Alexa isn't always reliable
Difficult to set up equipment control in some situations
The 2022 Fire TV Cube adds a handful of bells and whistles, including 4K upscaling and a faster processor, to a device that's been around for a while. The Cube has always been a mash-up of the Fire TV Stick and an Alexa speaker, allowing you to use your voice to search for shows and adjust the volume and inputs on your TV, dim lights, make Zoom calls (audio-only, unless you add a webcam), stream music and check the weather -- all hands-free, without using the remote. It also features an octa-core processor and 2GB of memory for lightning-fast streaming in 4K, as well as audio support for Dolby Atmos. That said, the latest version of the Cube has difficulty controlling devices connected to your TV -- especially if that TV happens to be a TCL -- and often misses the mark when integrating Alexa commands with your cable box.   ...

Fire TV Stick
Pros
Inexpensive
Remote offers Alexa voice and TV control
Wide range of streaming apps
Integrates well with Echo speakers
Cons
The cheaper Lite is a better value
The step-up 4K stick is better for 4K TVs
More complex menus than Roku
Although the Lite is a better value, the Amazon Fire TV Stick is another good choice for those who are still rocking regular HD TVs. The main difference between the Fire TV Stick and the cheaper Fire TV Stick Lite lies in the remote control. Fire Stick's remote has buttons for volume, mute and power, allowing you to control those functions on your TV. The Lite lacks these capabilities and is therefore slightly less expensive. If you have a 1080p TV and don't mind paying a little more for a remote that can control the volume on your TV, the Fire TV Stick is a good choice for you.  ... Show more

Fire TV Stick review
Add to compareFactors to consider when choosing a Fire TV Stick
BudgetBefore anything else, consider how much you're willing to spend on a Fire TV Stick. Higher-end models can cost up to $140, like the impressive Fire TV Cube. But if your budget is tighter, there are plenty of simpler yet effective Fire TV Sticks priced as low as $20. The entry-level standard Fire TV Stick, for example, offers HD playback if your television is compatible. Plenty of options exist for a range of budgets and all your streaming needs. Use casesConsider what exactly you'll be using your Fire TV Stick for. Are you hoping to turn your TV into a smart TV,
or are you looking for extra services beyond what your smart TV already offers? Maybe you're hoping to use your Fire TV Stick to control your smart home technology. Make sure your use cases align with the capabilities of the Fire TV Stick you choose. 4K and HDRModels like the Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick 4K and the 4K Max support 4K resolutions and HDR protocols, while the Fire TV Stick Lite and standard Fire TV Stick do not. If you're not too concerned about high-resolution streaming or your TV model doesn't support anything above 1080p, the latter models should suit your needs. Otherwise, you may want to opt for one of the 4K Sticks. Alexa integrationAll five Fire TV Stick models have remotes with built-in voice search and control powered by Alexa. But if you're looking for something a bit more advanced, the Fire TV Cube may be your best bet. That's because it's equipped with the full capabilities of a separate Alexa speaker, allowing you to use your TV hands-free, without a remote. Full Alexa integration also means that the Cube can control your smart-home gadgets, like lights and thermostats. While plain Fire Stick variants can also do this, they require a connection with a separate Amazon Echo speaker. If you're looking for an Alexa-speaker-streaming-device combination, you'd likely be happiest with the Fire TV Cube. If this isn't your top priority, or you already have an Echo speaker, one of the Fire TV Sticks will be fine.
How we test Fire TV devices
Every Fire TV Stick we review receives hours of hands-on testing. Typically, this involves installing the device on multiple TVs, evaluating the setup process, adding popular streaming channels and using the product as if it were our own. We use all of the major features available and note how they stack up against other Fire TV models in the company's lineup. To do this, we hook up multiple Fire TV streaming devices to the same TV so we can switch back and forth easily to compare the experiences.The metrics we use to rate a device include hardware design, distinctive features that differentiate models, remote capabilities and design, overall ease of use, effective layouts and design, search capabilities, privacy settings, the number of apps and their performance and the overall speed and reliability of the system. Other TV Sticks we've tested
Roku Express 4K Plus: The Express 4K Plus streaming media player is one of the cheapest streaming TV options with 4K HDR. (Even if your current TV doesn't support those formats, your next one probably will.) Thanks to the AirPlay update, this Roku device is one of the least expensive ways to connect your iPhone or other Apple device to your TV. It is cheaper than the company's Streaming Stick 4K Plus and other 4K HDR streaming devices, and it's our top pick for best streaming device overall.Chromecast with Google TV 4K: Chromecast outdoes Roku by adding Dolby Vision compatibility, but its biggest smart device strength is Google Assistant voice search, which works well for finding stuff to watch. We also like the impressive integration with other Google services such as Google Photos and YouTube TV. The interface is more evolved-looking than Roku, but ultimately we prefer Roku's simpler approach, no-nonsense search results and lower price. That said, the new Chromecast is a better smart streaming device choice for those already living in Google's world.Apple TV 4K: The Apple TV 4K continues to be a good choice for those who want an Apple device to use Apple Arcade for gaming or take full advantage of their Apple One subscription bundles. Video purists will appreciate its flexible HDR and TV calibration feature. For most people, however, Apple's venerable remote control streaming device just isn't worth the money, especially now that Roku has nearly all the major apps and AirPlay. If you really want Dolby Vision, you can find that on the Roku Streaming Stick 4K at a fraction of the price.Roku Streaming Stick 4K: The Roku Streaming Stick 4K features the same simple interface, large app selection and impressive search function found on all Roku devices, but also offers Dolby Vision support. While we think the Streaming Stick 4K is a great device, we're just not sold on the Dolby Vision upgrade -- mostly because we generally don't think that it provides a major image quality upgrade over standard HDR. But if Dolby Vision is important to you, this device will not disappoint. Fire TV Stick FAQ
What's the difference between a Fire TV device and a Fire TV television?
A Fire TV device, like the ones in this list, is a small stick-shaped or square piece of hardware that plugs into an HDMI port at the back of your TV. This gives your TV access to Amazon Fire TV software and content, no matter what brand of TV you own. Amazon also makes Fire TVs, which are televisions that come with Fire TV software preinstalled. This means that your TV will automatically have access to the Fire TV interface without the need for an additional streaming device.
Show more
What streaming apps are on Fire TV?
Fire TV offers a long list of streaming apps, including Netflix, Disney Plus, Apple TV, Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Peacock TV, Tubi, Pluto TV, Showtime, Discovery Plus and others. Spectrum cable users, however, do not have access to the Spectrum app on Fire TV.
Show more
Do I need an Amazon Prime membership to use Fire TV?
No, though you will need a free Amazon account in order to set up the device. While you don't need to pay for a Prime membership to use Amazon Fire TV, it is useful and recommended. Membership comes with a selection of Prime Video content, including access to shows such as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Expanse and Wheel of Time. These shows and other Amazon-branded content are heavily advertised in the Fire TV system and a Prime membership makes it easier to check out all that Amazon has to offer.
Show more
What is the best streaming device?
Of the Fire Stick models, we prefer the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. It launches apps quickly, and navigating around feels fast and smooth, thanks to its robust processor. It also comes with Dolby Vision support and Wi-Fi 6 for faster streaming. But when looking at all the great options on the market, we've given our top spot to the Roku Express 4K Plus. With the most streaming app options, the simplest streaming platform interface and the best search, the Express 4K plus is an excellent substitute to many Fire Stick devices. Unlike the Amazon-owned Fire Stick, the Roku also has a content-agnostic platform that doesn't push any one media streaming service provider, like Amazon Prime Video or Apple, over another.
Show more
Is there a monthly fee for a Fire TV Stick?
No, there is no monthly fee to use an Amazon Fire TV Stick. While you do need an Amazon account to set up the device, an Amazon Prime subscription is not required. Remember that many streaming services and channels do require a subscription to access them, like Netflix, Hulu or Disney Plus. Don't worry, though -- there are some great free options out there (Tubi, Pluto and Freevee are our top picks for the best free TV streaming services). With a Fire TV Stick in hand, you're sure to find great content with or without a subscription.
Show more
Is there a new Fire TV Stick coming out in 2025?
Amazon announced the new Fire TV Stick HD in October of 2024 to replace both the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite. The newest model, available for $35, delivers much of the same experience you'd expect from our current roundup of Fire TV Stick devices like 1080p resolution and Alexa integration.
