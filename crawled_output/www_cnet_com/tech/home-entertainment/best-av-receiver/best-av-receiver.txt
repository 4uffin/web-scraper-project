How we test
What to consider
Channels
If you’re looking for a Dolby Atmos receiver, the minimum number of channels is seven --
which is written as either 7.1 or 5.1.2 channels). Power specs are mostly made up, but anything over 100 watts per channel in stereo is good.
HDMI inputs
All modern components use the universal HDMI standard and so you should choose a receiver that has as many of these inputs as possible. If you’re a gamer choose one which has HDMI 2.1 so it can transmit 4K/120Hz to a TV as well.
Dolby Atmos capability
Most receivers over $500 include Dolby Atmos capability, but you don’t need to buy height speakers straight away. You can always add them later.
Wi-Fi music streaming
Alongside Bluetooth, many models have onboard Wi-Fi connectivity for wireless music streaming. Standards to look for include Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Cast.

Back to selection
If you’re serious about bringing theater-like sound into your home, an AV receiver is the best choice. An AV receiver gives you much more control over how you set up and interact with your home theater system. A receiver has many roles -- it acts as a video switch between components like a streaming box or gaming console, and it also decodes and amplifies audio signals so you can hear them through your speakers. The best receivers offer excellent sound quality and come equipped with 8K video, Dolby Atmos and music streaming capabilities, and they connect to your TV via an HDMI cable. You can start with as little as a pair of stereo speakers and then add rear speakers and a subwoofer later. This will enable you to get the best movie, TV show and music performance to suit your budget. Our Picks

8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
One of the best music streaming suites
Excellent home theater performance
Fun to use
Compatible with Xbox Series X/4K 120Hz signals
Cons
Not as dynamic with music
The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is my top choice because it's an excellent-sounding receiver at an affordable price. It has a particular knack for Dolby Atmos soundtracks with an expansive, yet detailed sound, and it's also very good at playing back music. It also offers plenty of streaming audio support, so it's ready to entertain as soon as you hook up the Wi-Fi.The TX-NR6100 is a 7 x 100-watt-per-channel receiver with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support. It includes six HDMI inputs at the back, with three able to pass 8K video; the remaining three ports include HDR10 and Dolby Vision compatibility. Vinyl is still in the middle of a revival, and the NR6100 enables users to take advantage thanks to a dedicated phono input for turntables and record players that lack an onboard phono preamp. Streaming options include Google Cast, DTS Play-Fi, Spotify Connect, Sonos, AirPlay and Bluetooth. Though you can pay much more, or even much less, the Onkyo TX-6100 offers the best mix of usability and performance for the money.  ... Show more

Best AV receiver for power users
Onkyo TX-RZ50
Pros
Dirac Live calibration for excellent sound
Best streaming suite offered in a receiver
Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa connectivity
Cons
Difficult setup for Dirac
Onkyo's TX-RZ50 is a perfect step-up model for those looking to upgrade their home theater systems for a set of better-quality speakers or to add a turntable. Like its budget-oriented label mate, the TX-NR6100, it's stacked with features including the audiophile-level calibration called Dirac Live, as well as the best streaming suite offered in an AV receiver. On that point, being able to request songs directly from Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa is a real boon.What improvements does the $1,699 TX-RZ50 offer over the $800 TX-NR6100? Firstly, it offers double the number of 8K compatible inputs (six versus three) plus it boasts more power (120 watts versus 100 watts). It also has two-way Bluetooth for streaming as well as listening on wireless headphones.The TX-RZ50's performance was excellent, whether listening to streamed music or watching a movie: I hadn't heard Dolby Atmos sound this convincing in a long time. The addition of Dirac Live does pose its own complexities in setup -- please, only use the Onkyo Controller mobile app in combination with the supplied microphone -- but doing so rewards with a highly involving performance.  ...

Yamaha RX-A4A
Pros
Excellent build quality
Booming cinematic sound
Built-in phono preamp
Cons
Doesn't sound great with music streaming
I'm a big fan of the Yamaha RX-V6A, so I was curious to see what the step-up RX-A4A brings to the table. As it turns out, this Yamaha offers even better build quality and a huge, cinematic sound.Look through the fancy top grille and you'll see neatly packed components and a distinguished, stamped transformer. The system is capable of a beefy 110 watts per channel (stereo) and has seven HDMI ports for your connectivity needs.I tested the Yamaha A4A against the Onkyo RZ50 and the older Denon X3700. The Yamaha's sound quality tended toward the cinematic rather than the musical, and it offered a big, roomy sound perfect for blockbusters or conspiracy thriller TV shows. What was surprising is that the onboard phono preamp was even better than the one on the rival Onkyo RZ50, so I can recommend the Yamaha for people who don't want a separate preamp for their turntable.The Yamaha is great as a home theater receiver but doesn't sound as good with music streaming. Still, as the Onkyo offers balanced performance across both, it's my current favorite.  ... Show more

Sony STR-AN1000
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Plenty of streaming connectivity including Sonos
Excellent sound
8K and 4K/120Hz support
Cons
Slightly higher retail price than competitors
Lower power rating
Poorly designed remote control
If you're a gamer, this receiver will be able to keep up with the latest games and consoles like the Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5. The Sony STR-AN1000 is a 7.2-channel Dolby Atmos receiver that offers a whole host of new features, including HDMI 2.1 (4K/120Hz) support and Sony's own 360 Reality Audio. It boasts superb connectivity with six HDMI inputs (two with 8K compatibility) and two 8K outputs. The receiver also includes support for video standards such as Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG for high-resolution gaming. As far as analog inputs, the Sony offers four, though it does lack a dedicated phono input. The Sony also has one of the most sophisticated setup routines yet, so dialing in great sound is even easier. It offers an upgraded version of its calibration routine, now called Digital Cinema Auto Calibration IX. This involves a new stereo microphone and a natty plastic stand -- where competitors' are cardboard -- and it now accommodates multiple seating positions. If you prefer to do a manual AV receiver calibration, then the system is quite powerful, as it now lets you set the height of the screen and speakers; most receivers do not let you do this. But the main reason to buy it is its outstanding performance, especially for video games.  ... Show more

Sony STR-AN1000 review
Add to compareWhich receiver should you buy?
The Onkyo TX-NR6100 is the best receiver for most needs Ty Pendlebury/CNETIf you're spending under $1,000, there are four main receivers to choose from -- the Sony STR-AN1000, the Yamaha RX-V6A, the Onkyo TX-NR6100 and the Denon AVR-970H. All offer excellent performance, so the short answer about which to buy is whichever is available for the lowest price. At the moment, that is either the Denon or the Onkyo, and I especially recommend the Onkyo TX-NR6100" target="_self for its combination of excellent performance and connectivity. The Onkyo offers easy setup, excellent usability, solid looks and useful features, including the best streaming suite (alongside Sony). As an added plus, the Onkyo was never prone to the 4K issue that plagued early versions of the Yamaha RX-V6A.Meanwhile, the step-up Onkyo TX-RZ50 is an excellent receiver if you're looking for the next level of features and a performance bump over sub-$1,000 models. It offers an excellent, if slightly scary, calibration routine from Dirac Live and the best number of streaming features on the market. It sounds great with music and movies alike.  	Lastly, if it's home theater thrills you're after, the Yamaha RX-A4A offers crisp, dynamic sound and fantastic build quality for $1,300.
Factors to consider when buying an AV receiver
AV receivers are notoriously complex, with reams of features and confusing technical specifications. (For example, what's 4K/120Hz anyway?) Yet, what are the things that really matter when buying a new model? I'm going to sum up the most important ones right here.
HDMI inputsWith most TVs and set-top boxes supporting HDMI, you should buy a receiver that has as many of these HDMI input ports and outputs as possible. Front-mounted HDMI ports are kind of like a human appendix -- unneeded, because most users don't hot-plug HDMI devices -- making the number of rear inputs what's most important. (How else are you going to connect your Roku, Blu-ray player, Nintendo Switch and all your other devices?) The Onkyo TX-NR6100 and Denon AVR-S970H have six rear-mounted HDMI inputs, while the Yamaha RX-V6A goes one better with seven. If you want to connect two different displays -- a TV and a projector, for example -- all but the Yamaha offer a second HDMI output. You should also be sure you have an extra HDMI cable or two on hand -- these things are like the second sock of a pair as you can never find them when you need them.Dolby Atmos capabilityMost receivers in the $500-and-above price range include Dolby Atmos capability and DTS:X, but the effect these formats have on your home theater movie-watching can be subtle, or in most movies, nonexistent. In other words, don't worry about missing out on these formats by not installing a ceiling-pointing speaker or two. Mounting your rear surround speakers high on the wall will get you halfway there in terms of quality, immersive sound.WiFi music streamingMost midrange receivers have onboard Wi-Fi network connectivity for wireless music streaming via your speaker system. There are plenty of standards for wireless streaming services, but the most universal are Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay and Google Cast. If you're looking to build a multiroom system with a variety of AV systems and speakers with wireless connectivity, these are the three flavors to aim for. Onkyo and Sony are the only devices to support all three. The Denon receiver model lacks wireless streaming via Google but ups the ante to AirPlay 2 and the proprietary HEOS system. Meanwhile, Yamaha has its own MusicCast system. How CNET tests AV receivers
The CNET Audio Lab in downtown Manhattan where I test turntables, soundbars, and AV receivers side-by-side Ty PendleburyAt CNET, I test audio equipment from compact soundbars to surround sound systems, but regardless of the device, my methodology is the same. I always compare products against one or more reference devices that offer the best performance at a similar price.
When it comes to receivers I want to see how well a system performs with music and movies, as most people will want to do both. I watch test scenes from 4K Blu-ray or streamed from a 4K streaming service (Fandango at Home, for example) and evaluate aspects such as Dolby Atmos surround sound performance and dialog clarity. I also use several test music tracks and test streaming features such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Systems that can perform well with both types of entertainment inevitably score the highest.
Check out CNET's receiver buying guide for more about the features and things you should consider when looking for a new system.
Other AV receivers I tested
The Denon AVR A10H is a 13.4-channel receiver. Ty Pendlebury/CNETDenon AVR-A10H ($5,199): If you hear the words "home theater" and think "dedicated room with a screen and leather recliners," then the AVR-A10H is the kind of receiver you would use to power it. It has all of the features you need, including Dolby Atmos, music streaming, 4K/120Hz on all seven HDMI inputs and more. While it sounds good -- I tested it powering a set of Klipsch Fortes -- the combination of a high price and 13(!) powered channels may be too much for most living rooms.
Yamaha RX-V6A Ty Pendlebury/CNETYamaha RX-V6A ($599): This Yamaha RX-V6A offers a fresh look at AV receiver design, with its futuristic edges and simple controls, while maximizing sound quality. The Yamaha might even make you forget about visiting a cinema ever again, and it's no slouch with music, either. It offers plenty of connectivity with Wi-Fi bringing AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth and Yamaha's MusicCast system for streaming from your devices. Notably, the TSR-700 is identical, and it was an exclusive model for some outlets. Find out more in CNET's Yamaha RX-V6A review. Denon AVR-X3800 ($1,699) Denon has a reputation for quality sound and powerful amplification, and the AVR-X3800 will be able to power most systems with ease. In terms of features, the Denon has everything you need in a modern receiver including Dolby Atmos and six 8K HDMI inputs. Based on my head-to-head testing, I found that the Denon was even-handed with movies and music, but not as good as the equivalent Marantz SR6015 with music or as good at home theater as my current pick, the Onkyo RZ50. Read CNET's first take on the Denon AVR-X3800. AV receiver FAQs
What is the difference between a stereo receiver and an AV receiver?
A stereo receiver is an audio-only, two-channel amplifier that includes source switching and an AM/FM tuner -- if it lacks a tuner it's called an integrated amp. Meanwhile, an AV receiver is typically a surround sound system amplifier that enables HDMI switching and playback of audio and video. Most also include tuners onboard as well. An AV receiver is more versatile than a two-channel model because it can be used for both stereo and surround sound. You can add as many speakers to them as you have, starting at just two -- so they're pretty flexible to build out your surround sound system.

Should I buy an 8K receiver?
Standards change all the time, but the bare minimum right now is support for HDR and Dolby Vision, and at least HDMI version 2.0 or better. All of the models above support not only 4K and HDR video but 8K support as well, even if 8K content is hard to find. Be aware that all 2020 8K-compatible receivers were prone to a bug preventing them from displaying variable refresh rate video, and from the Xbox Series X in particular. Denon, Marantz and Yamaha announced fixes for existing models, while compliant models from Yamaha RX-V6A began shipping in the summer of 2021. Denon and Marantz receivers sold after April 2021 should be 4K/120Hz compatible. Yamaha users can check for 4K compatibility here while Denon and Marantz users should check with their dealer.The TX-NR6100 is the first receiver I tested that I found to both pass 4K/120Hz and which I would also recommend to new buyers.

How do I connect my TV to my AV receiver?
If you have a relatively new TV you should be able to use a single cable -- an HDMI cable, to be exact -- to connect your receiver to your television. If you have an HDMI port labeled ARC/eARC on the TV you can connect that to the main HDMI ARC output of the receiver. Doing so enables you to hear onboard Netflix from your TV when you set the receiver on the "TV" input, while also enabling video to be transmitted from your other AV sources.If you have an older TV without an ARC-compliant port you will need to connect both an HDMI cable and an optical cable to the back of your TV. However, if you have a CRT or rear-projection TV which has composite or component inputs you will need a $1,000-plus receiver such as the Marantz SR6015 or Onkyo TX-RZ50. Many receivers no longer offer switching for these legacy connections.

Is 4K/120Hz support a big deal?
The short answer is: Yes, but only if you own an Xbox Series X and a brand-new TV. As I write this, there is a growing number of Xbox Series X games that support this optional mode -- including Halo Infinite and Fortnite, to name a couple -- but the advantages of 4K/120Hz over 60Hz are minimal as far as I've seen at this point. Future games and even video sources may make the differences clearer, and that's why you may want a receiver that's fully compatible.If you do buy an older receiver, you don't care about the Xbox Series X, you can always hook a fancy new console directly to the TV, then use eARC to get audio to the receiver.
