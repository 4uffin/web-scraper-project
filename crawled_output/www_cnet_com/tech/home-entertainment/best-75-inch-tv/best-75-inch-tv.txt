What to consider
Price
75-inch TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive and spending more money can also get you better image quality.
Screen size
Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best.
Capability
Finding a worthwhile smart TV system is most important for entry-level TVs. High-end TVs are more about picture quality.

Back to selection
Bigger screens mean more impressive, immersive images, and a 75-inch TV is really big. Of course these days you can buy 85-inch and even larger TVs, so by that measure a 75-inch screen might seem just perfect for you. We've listed the best 75-inch TVs we've reviewed along with some 77-inch OLED models. (That's because there are no 75-inch OLEDs, you'll want an OLED screen if you want the best image quality.) These sets range from budget to expensive, and many include the latest gaming and image quality features including a 120Hz refresh rate and mini-LED. If a 65-inch TV just isn't big enough and you have the space, one of these 75-inchers might be just the right fit for watching college basketball's biggest tournament. Our Picks

75-inch TV FAQ
What is the best 75-inch TV overall?If you're in the market for a large TV, you may feel some extra pressure to find one that not only meets your size requirements but offers the best features -- all without breaking the bank. The TCL QM8 TV sits at the top of our list of best TVs: It offers superb picture quality, an affordable price tag and Roku, the best smart TV system. It also includes gaming features like 4K/120Hz input and variable refresh rate that can get the most out of consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series X. When a friend asks me what 65- to 98-inch TV to buy, and money is still an object, I tell them to get the TCL QM8.There are plenty of other excellent choices out there, however, so even though the QM8 is my current favorite for most people, it might not be right for your preferences or budget. 2025 TVs are also hitting the shelves right now but, for the most apart, we'll continue to recommending their (discounted) 2023 versions .The most important factor when choosing a new 75-inch TV is its size, and that depends on your room type and how far from the wall your sofa or bed is located. At CNET, our general advice is that bigger is usually better, especially if you're looking to get the most bang for your buck. To help you find the right big-screen TV for your needs and budget, we've rounded up some of the best 75-inch TVs on the market right now. The list below represents the best TVs I've reviewed in CNET's test lab, where I've compared them side by side. I've actually reviewed the 65-inch sizes in the series for most of the models listed below, but the 75- and 77-inch versions are basically identical beyond screen size. Read more: How to Watch March MadnessBest 75-inch TVs of 2025

SCORE
Pros
Relatively affordable
Excellent overall image quality

Capable Google TV system
Cons
Not as accurate as some competitors
Only available in 65-inch size and larger
TCL continues to dominate our rankings of the best 75-inch TVs, and the QM8 model sets a new standard. It shines in my comparison tests with superior brightness and impact while keeping great contrast -- something other 75-inch TVs can't match at this price. Thanks to its mini-LED technology and full-array local dimming, the QM8's picture quality is exceptional. The design remains sleek and modern at this size, and has a center-mount stand. Although the QM8 operates on Google TV (which I find less user-friendly compared to Roku TV), it still offers a solid smart TV experience, making it our top pick in the 75-inch TV market. This model is the successor to last year’s TCL 6-Series Roku TV.  ... Show more

No major improvements over the C2 from 2022
The LG OLED77C3 stands out among non-OLED TVs in our roundup of the best 75-inch TVs, offering superior picture quality at a reasonable price. It beat out the mini-LED models in my comparison tests with its perfect black levels, unmatched contrast and great off-angle viewing. While it's not the brightest option, it still performs incredibly well in all kinds of room lighting. The C3 is also one of the lightest TVs we've ever reviewed thanks to its carbon-fiber construction.We've also looked at this year's C4 model, which performed well. You can check out that review here. For now, we recommend the C3 as long as it's available as it offers a better value with only slight differences from the C4.

Best 77-inch TV picture quality
Samsung S95D
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Best overall image quality we've tested
Best-in-class glare reduction in a bright rooms
Superior contrast and off-angle viewing
Ultrathin panel with external input box
Cons
Expensive
Slightly diminished contrast in bright rooms
The Samsung S95D is a standout in our list of the best 75-inch TVs, mainly because of its matte finish that nearly eliminates reflections. This is a huge plus for viewing in bright rooms, and it's better at reducing glare than any other OLED TV we've tested, a display technology that has always delivered the best picture available. It's also the first OLED TV to feature a matte screen, which is typically only found in non-OLED models. This finish really makes a difference, turning sharp reflections from lights and windows into soft, barely-noticeable glows. The S95D also comes with an external box for connections, which means you can keep HDMI cables and the power cord hidden away. In terms of image quality, the Samsung S95D beats all its 75-inch competitors, including the G4 and last year's G3, as well as any non-OLED TV. But it's still quite expensive. While it's ideal for those with brighter rooms, many people will be perfectly happy with a less expensive TV.  ... Show more

Best 75-inch midpriced TV
Vizio Quantum Pro
7.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Bright, high-contrast image for the price
Preserves picture well from off-angle
Cons
Slightly less accurate color
Available in only two sizes
In our search for the best TVs, Vizio has consistently delivered very good picture quality at a great price. The 75-inch Quantum Pro is no exception, offering solid performance as a mid-priced option, though not without a few downsides. In our side-by-side comparisons, the Vizio Quantum Pro performed quite well for the price point and stands out with better contrast than other similarly priced TVs like the Roku Plus Series. It didn't quite reach the brightness and contrast levels of slightly more expensive models like the TCL QM8 and Hisense 75U8K, but that's to be expected with a mid-priced option. One major drawback is that the Quantum Pro is its limited size offerings; it's only available in 65- or 75-inch sizes. While we tested the 65-inch model, the same review applies to the 75-inch version since the features and picture quality will be similar regardless of size. But if you're specifically looking for a 75-inch TV, the Vizio Quantum Pro is a strong, affordable contender.

7.8

SCORE
Pros
Affordable
Good picture quality thanks to local dimming
Great smart TV system
Cons
Lacks 120Hz refresh rate and other gaming extras
Not as bright as some similarly priced TVs
Competition in the mid-priced 75-inch TV market is intense, and the Roku Plus series is a notable new option. This model stands out as an entirely Roku brand product, unlike other TCL Roku TVs featured higher up on our list. It includes upgrades like QLED and full-array local dimming, which enhance picture quality beyond what you'd get from, say, the TCL 4-Series. This is Roku's first venture into making TVs under its own name, rather than partnering with other manufacturers like TCL, Sharp, Pioneer or Hisense. Roku has also introduced a lower-tier model, the Roku Select Series, which comes with fewer features and lacks local dimming, but is also available in a 75-inch size.

TCL 4-Series
7.0

SCORE
Pros
Affordable
Excellent Smart TV system
Cons
Image quality and features lag in some entry-level TVs
The TCL 4-Series stood out in our 75-inch TV testing with its great picture quality at a lower price point. But as a budget TV, it lacks some higher-end features like Dolby Vision, Bluetooth connectivity and AMD FreeSync with a variable refresh rate. Still, the 4-Series is a reliable 75-inch choice if you're OK without the bells and whistles of something more expensive. The 4-Series' main advantage is that it comes with Roku's Smart TV system built in, which makes it easy for anyone wanting an all-in-one smart TV solution without buying additional streaming devices. Note that TCL has been selling the 4-Series for the last few years with little visible change in its image quality or features, though it has recently added some larger screen sizes, including an 85-inch option.

Pros
Relatively affordable

If you're on the hunt for the best value 75-inch TV and the TCL QM8 isn't quite what you're looking for, consider the Hisense 75U8K. Though I slightly preferred the QM8 in a head-to-head comparison, the U8K impressed me with its features and image performance.The budget-friendly 75U8K offers excellent picture quality thanks to its mini-LED backlights and full-array local dimming. It also incorporates unique gaming features and operates on the user-friendly Google TV system. Plus, the U8K is significantly cheaper than other 75-inch TVs with comparable quality from more established brands, making it a strong contender for those seeking a great deal on a 75-inch TV.  ...

Add to compareFactors to Consider When Choosing a 75-inch TV
With all the TVs available today, and all the technical terms and jargon associated with television technology, it can be tough to figure out what's important. Here's a quick guide to help cut through the confusion.Price: TVs range in price from $100 to more than $2,000. Smaller screens are cheaper, well-known brands are more expensive, and spending more money can also get you better image quality. Most entry-level TVs have a good enough picture for most people, but TVs last a long time, so it might be worth spending more to get a better picture. It's also best to shop for a TV in the fall, when prices are lower.Screen size: Bigger is better in our book. We recommend a size of at least 43 inches for a bedroom TV and at least 55 inches for a living room or main TV -- and 65 inches or larger is best. More than any other "feature," stepping up in TV screen size is the best use of your money. One of the most common post-TV-purchase complaints we've heard is from people who didn't go big enough. And we almost never hear people complain that their TV is too large.Capability: When it comes to entry-level TVs, the most important feature is what kind of smart TV system the TV uses. Among midrange models, look for a feature including full-array local dimming, mini-LED and 120Hz refresh rate, which (unlike some other extras) do help improve the picture, in our experience.

Our primary TV test lab has specialized equipment for measuring light and color, including a Konica Minolta CS-2000 spectroradiometer, a Murideo Sig-G 4K HDR signal generator and an AVPro Connect 8x8 4K HDR distribution matrix. We use Portrait Displays CalMan Ultimate software to evaluate every television we review. In every CNET TV review, three or more similar TVs are compared side by side in various lighting conditions, playing different media, including movies, TV shows and games, and across a variety of test categories, from color to video processing to gaming to HDR. Our reviews also account for design, features, smart TV performance, HDMI input and gaming compatibility, and other factors.One important aspect of image quality we test is overall brightness. Here's how it compares in nits across select TVs listed above. Check out How We Test TVs for more details.

75-inch TV FAQ
Is a 75-inch TV too big?
It depends on your room size, seating distance and personal taste. For a large living room or den, a 75-inch TV is generally excellent, but it's too big for smaller living rooms or most bedrooms. If you sit closer to the screen, you don't need as large a TV for the best experience. For maximum theatrical impact, according to THX and SMPTE, you should be between 7.5 and 10 feet from a 75-inch screen, although many viewers will find it more comfortable to sit a bit further back than that. Every 75-inch TV has 4K resolution, and if you have 20/20 vision you can sit as close as about 4.5 feet from the screen and still not discern individual pixels.

How wide is a 75-inch TV?
Most 75-inch TVs measure between 65 and 67 inches wide. Because the frames around newer TV screens are typically quite narrow, 75-inch TV widths don't vary much. f you're not planning to wall-mount the TV, you generally want the piece of furniture supporting the TV to measure at least as wide as the TV itself, and preferably a few inches wider. Refer to the manufacturer's website for exact dimensions of a particular 75-inch or 77-inch TV.

How much does a 75-inch TV weigh?
A 75-inch TV weighs between 75 and 100 pounds with its stand, but this varies significantly depending on the type of TV. Removing the stand allows you to wall-mount the TV and reduces its weight (stands can weigh up to 20 pounds). Shipping weight (box, accessories, etc.) adds another 10 to 20 pounds. Refer to the manufacturer's website for exact weight of a particular 75-inch TV.

What is the best resolution for a 75-inch TV?
Most 75-inch TVs (or any TV over 50 inches) are made in 4K, meaning they have 8 million pixels that compose the picture on the TV. A single pixel, or discrete picture element, consists of a tiny dot on the screen. However, newer and much more expensive 75-inch TVs may be available in 8K resolution (33 million pixels), but we don't think those are worth buying just yet. Stick with 4K for now when buying a 75-inch TV and check out our guide to TV resolutions for more information.
