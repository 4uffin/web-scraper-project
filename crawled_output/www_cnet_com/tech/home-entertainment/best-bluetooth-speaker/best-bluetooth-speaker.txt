What to consider
Budget
Before anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker.
Size
Be sure to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable.
Durability
Many Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach or on a hiking trip, consider a more durable speaker.
Speakerphone capabilities
Some speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone.

It's summertime -- or as I like to call it, portable Bluetooth speaker season. I test everything from tiny speakers that strap onto the handle bars of your bike to big Bluetooth boom boxes that pump out surprisingly powerful sound that can fuel your outdoor pool and beach parties. With each passing year Bluetooth speakers continue to improve, featuring better sound quality, longer battery life and more durable designs that makes them suitable for indoor and outdoor use. Many are fully waterproof and some even float. I've included options in every size category and price range, with several budget-friendly choices for those who don't want to spend a lot. Our Picks

What is the best Bluetooth speaker overall?With so many great Bluetooth speakers out there, it's hard to declare one the best overall. Currently, the new Bose SoundLink Plus tops our list, striking the right balance of performance and price, earning a CNET Editors' Choice award in the process. The Soundcore by Anker Boom 2 remains an excellent overall value along with Anker's new Soundcore Boom 3i. I'm also also a fan of the the new LG Xboom Bounce, Sony ULT Field 3 and ULT Field 5, Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen), JBL Charge 6 and Beats Pill.What We Updated: August 2025We added the Sonos Move 2 with it being discounted to $350 or $100 off its list price of $450.

Best Bluetooth speaker overall
Bose SoundLink Plus
Pros
Sleek design with integrated rope loop
IP67 waterproof, dustproof and shock-resistant
Impressive sound for its size with fairly robust, well-defined bass and good clarity
EQ settings in Bose companion
USB-C charge out allows you to power up a phone and other devices
Cons
While it's $130 less than the SoundLink Max, it's still pricey
No built-in microphone for speakerphone capabilities
No auxiliary input
As Bose continues to expand its SoundLink portable Bluetooth speaker line, it's become harder to choose which is best for you. That said, the new-for-2025 SoundLink Plus ($269, £250, AU$430), which sits between the more compact second-gen SoundLink Flex ($149, £150, AU$250) and the beefier and pricier SoundLink Max ($399, £400, AU$600), may just be the best of the bunch, the goldilocks of Bose Bluetooth speakers. While it can't play quite as loud or deliver as much bass as the larger Max, it costs significantly less and puts out clear, potent sound that's a big step up from the Flex's sound. It strikes the right balance of performance and price, earning a CNET Editors' Choice award in the process. Read my full review.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Well-priced
Fairly compact yet delivers impressive sound with big volume and strong bass
Waterproof and floats
USB-out port
LED lighting
Good battery life
Cons
No dust-resistance rating
I liked the original Soundcore Motion Boom, which made our best Bluetooth speakers list and was one of the better mini boom box Bluetooth speaker values over the past few years, selling for about $80). The 3.75-pound Boom 2 costs more but sounds substantially better (read full review), with more than double the power rating of the original, so it not only plays louder but kicks out more bass and offers better clarity at higher volumes (it's equipped with two tweeters and one subwoofer). It also has a couple of built-in LED lights to help create that party vibe. It's an impressive sounding speaker for its size and a good value.Waterproof (IPX7-rated) with a floatable design, the speaker's battery life is rated at up to 24 hours at moderate volume levels (it charges via USB-C) and you can tweak the sound and customize the lighting with the Soundcore app for iOS and Android. There's also a USB-out port to charge your devices. Read full review.

Pros
Impressive sound
Attractively styled
P67 waterproof, dust-proof, rust-proof and shock-resistant
Party lighting
USB-C charge out
Decent party life
Cons
Fairly pricey
Somewhat hefty
Sony has released a couple of new-for-2025 portable Bluetooth speakers, the ULT Field 3 ($200) and ULT Field 5 ($330), to fill out its ULT line, which now includes six models. I liked the ULT Field 3 and ULT Field 5. Both are IP67 waterproof, dust-proof, rust-proof and shock-resistant. They include a removable shoulder strap and offer significantly improved sound over their predecessors, with more bass and better overall clarity. As you might guess, the larger ULT Field 5 delivers a bigger sound with more bass than the ULT Field 3. While somewhat pricey, it's one of the best-sounding Bluetooth speakers I've tested in its size class and is also equipped with party lighting and a USB charge-out port. Battery life is rated for up to 20 hours at moderate volume levels (or 10 with party lighting on).  ... Show more

Top LG Bluetooth speaker with strong sound
LG Xboom Bounce by Will.i.am
Pros
Durable design that's meets military specs
Strong, natural sound quality with good bass performance and clarity
Fully waterproof
Integrated carrying strap and lighting element
Cons
Unclear how well how strap/handle will hold up over time
LG's partnership with Black Eyed Peas' frontman Will.i.am is paying dividends as the company's latest crop of Bluetooth speakers measure up well against key competitors in the space. I tried the Xboom Grab ($140) and the Xboom Bounce ($200) and came away liking both speakers. But the larger Bounce has significantly fuller sound, with a lot more kick to the bass. On both speakers, I appreciated that they seemed well tuned and more natural sounding than many Bluetooth speakers I test, particularly in the midrange where vocals live (vocals are a bit forward, but I liked that).The speaker has an interesting concept for a handle. It's a flexible strap that you can also use for hanging the speaker from a hook or anything that the strap will hook onto (the strap is integrated into the design of the speaker). The only question I had was whether it might stretch out over time. That said, it does appear to be replaceable.The speaker is IP67 dust- and water-resistant, which means it's fully waterproof. LG also says it offers "military-grade durability" and is able to withstand "high temperature, rain, salt fog, blowing dust, vibration, immersion and shock." It's also rated for an impressive 30 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and has an understated lighting element that adds a little bit of flair. Finally, the Bounce is Auracast-enabled and works with LG's ThinQ app for iOS and Android (not its Xboom app), where you'll find software updates and equalizer settings to tweak the sound profile a bit.Note that there doesn't seem to be any difference between the Bounce and Bounce Core, so get the cheaper model. Weirdly, a search on the topic gets this AI result from Google: "The LG Xboom Bounce and Xboom Bounce Core are essentially the same speaker, with the main difference being the manufacturing location and time. They are the same model, manufactured at different times and places, but offered at the same price point."  ... Show more

Best mini Bluetooth speaker
Bose SoundLink Flex (2nd Gen)
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Impressive volume for its compact size, can fill a living room with sound with no distortion at higher volumes
Very good bass and good clarity in the treble and midrange
Prop it up horizontally, lay it down flat or hang it vertically by its sturdy integrated loop
Fully waterproof and dust-proof with IP67 rating (and also floats)
Automatically optimized speakerphone with built-in microphone for voice calling
Longer battery life
Cons
No audio input for wired listening
Silicone finish on back attracts some dust and lint
Uses Bluetooth 4.2 instead of 5.1
When the SoundLink Flex speaker launched, Bose made some bold claims about its new Bluetooth speaker, particularly its bass performance. But it mostly lived up to the hype and is arguably the best-sounding wireless speaker for its compact size. A second-gen model quietly arrived in October 2024 that adds a few
features, including a new customizable shortcut button, Bose app compatibility (you can now tweak the sound profile with an equalizer and create a SimpleSync connection with another compatible Bose product) and support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs. It's also equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 4.2. While those aren't major upgrades, they do make an excellent portable Bluetooth speaker slightly better.The second-gen SoundLink Flex is available in black, blue dusk, sandstone and a new alpine sage color. Like the original, it's equipped with Bose's PositionIQ technology to automatically detect the speaker's orientation and deliver optimized sound based on whether it's upright, hanging or flat on its back.  ...

The Soundcore Boom 3i comes in three color options. David Carnoy/CNET
Best compact rugged speaker that floats
Anker Soundcore Boom 3i
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Compact, rugged design saltwater-resistance
Floats floats and "auto-corrects" to keep the speaker drivers facing upward
Good sound for its size with a reasonable amount of bass
Built-in light show
Emergency alarm
Cons
A little overpriced at its list price
Audio warbles if a wave washes over the speaker in water
Can distort a little at higher volumes
In some ways, Anker's new Soundcore Boom 3i is the spiritual successor of the company's popular Soundcore Motion Plus speaker that was released in 2020. It's similarly shaped but has more of an outdoor adventure slant with Anker calling it "built for the wild" and billing it as the first Bluetooth speaker with playback in water, as it floats and "auto-corrects" to keep the speaker drivers facing upward just above the surface. As you'd expect from a speaker that promotional photos show strapped onto a kayak (it does have a detachable carrying strap), the Soundcore Boom 3i is fully waterproof and dust-resistant, with an IP68 rating. Anker takes things a step further, touting the Boom 3i as "5X" saltwater-resistant.You shouldn't expect audiophile sound from a mono Bluetooth speaker of this ilk. But for the most part, the Soundcore Boom 3i gives you what you want from a portable Bluetooth speaker from a sound perspective. By that I mean it plays loud for its size -- it weighs about 1.8 pounds and measures 8.3 by 3.1 by 3.3 inches -- plus it puts out a reasonable amount of bass and has fairly respectable clarity. You can find speakers that sound a little more natural, but these types of rugged portable speakers aren't designed for critical listening (it can distort a little at higher volumes).I tested the speaker's playback in water and indeed it flipped over, so the speaker drivers were facing up, and the music kept playing, though the audio got a little garbled when a little wave passed over the speaker, and the drivers started spitting water out. The speaker also has another interesting feature: Holding down the "BassUp" bass-boost button for 5 seconds sets off a 96-decibel emergency alarm -- Anker says it's clearly audible at up to 100 meters -- with flashing red LED lights (yes, the speaker has a built-in light show). You can hit any button to turn the alarm off.   ... Show more

Best Bose mini home Bluetooth speaker
Bose SoundLink Home
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Sleek design thats fits well in a home
Impressive volume and bass for its small size with decent sound clarity
Two-device linking compatibility to create a stereo pair for even better sound
Solid speakerphone capabilities with clear voice calling and good background noise reduction
USB-C audio for wired, lossless listening from devices
Cons
Doesn't link with Bose app to tweak sound profile
No water resistance rating
Somewhat expensive
Some sound limitations due to size
The best way to describe Bose's new SoundLink Home speaker is as the spiritual successor to the SoundLink Mini 2, which was quietly discontinued in late 2018. Available in two color options, the SoundLink Home is a portable Bluetooth speaker with up to 9 hours of battery life but it has more of an indoor design, with an aluminum chassis and no water resistance (you can move it around but it's not a speaker you'd take to the beach or take camping).Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and weighing slightly more than 2 pounds, it's able to deliver an impressive amount of bass sound for its compact size. Overall, it sounds excellent for a mini Bluetooth speaker, featuring decent clarity and bigger sound than the SoundLink Flex. However, like any small speaker, it does have its sound limitations (if you push the volume up with certain tracks, it can sound a bit restrained in certain frequencies as its digital processing seeks to prevent distortion). Putting two of these speakers together as a stereo pair does produce significantly better sound and you can link the speaker directly to a computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C cable for wired sound (it does sound slightly better in wired USB-C mode). On a more critical note, it's somewhat expensive and doesn't link to Bose's companion app for headphones and other Bluetooth speakers, so you can't tweak the sound profile.  ... Show more

Beats Pill

SCORE
Pros
Impressive sound quality with newly-engineered woofer system for better bass definition and wide soundstages
Very good volume for its size, and can link multiple Pills in amplify mode to further boost sound
USB-C audio for lossless wired listening and charge-out feature
IP67 waterproof and dust-proof with soft-to-the-touch rubber finish
Good speakerphone functionality with clear voice calling and background noise elimination
Integrated detachable lanyard for easy portability and listening options
Cons
No auxiliary input for wired lossless listening
Heavier than Bose SoundLink Flex
The Beats Pill of 2024 has improved in some key ways from its predecessor, particularly in sound quality, durability, battery life and price point. I do like the form factor and lighter weight of the Bose SoundLink Flex. The Pill does have a few extras like USB-C audio wired mode and speakerphone functionality that are appealing.You'll have to decide how important those extras are when weighing the Pill against the Bose SoundLink Flex. Any way you look at it, the Pill is a very good compact Bluetooth speaker. Like the Bose, it's an easy portable wireless speaker to recommend, especially if its price dips by $20 to $30, as the SoundLink Flex's price sometimes does during flash sales.  ... Show more

Best new JBL Bluetooth speaker
JBL Charge 6
Pros
Excellent sound with better bass, clarity and minimal distortion at higher volumes
Fully dust- and waterproof and ruggedly designed with removable handle for easy portability and more listening options
USB-C audio for lossless wired connection that can also be used as a charge-in or charge-out port
Good battery life (up to 24 hours)
Cons
Fairly pricey
JBL hasn't radically redesigned the Charge 6 on the outside -- it looks similar to its predecessor and weighs the same (2.11 pounds) -- but it does have better sound, battery life and lossless audio over a USB-C connection. One of the more noticeable external changes is to the new model's charge-out port (that port is why the speaker line is called "Charge"). Instead of a USB-A out port hidden under a gasket, there's a single exposed USB-C port that's both charge-in and charge-out. It allows you to use this fully waterproof and dust-proof (IP68) speaker as a power bank and charge devices like your smartphone while streaming music to the speaker. Additionally, JBL has added a removable handle to the Charge 6.The larger Charge has always sounded significantly better than the smaller Flip, and that hasn't changed with the Charge 6, even as the Flip 7 has also improved its sound quality. The Charge 6 produces more bass and a bigger overall sound with minimal distortion at higher volumes (both speakers feature better overall clarity). While the Flip 7's smaller size makes it easier to carry around, the Charge 6 is worth the extra money if sound quality is a priority. I have some quibbles with its somewhat high price -- its list price is $20 higher than the Charge 5's -- but the Charge 6 is easily one of the best speakers in its size class. Read our first take of the Charge 6.

Best Sonos portable speaker
Sonos Move 2
Pros
Improved sound and battery life
Water-resistant and dustproof
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Links with other Sonos speaker for multi-room audio
Autotuning system calibrates to any environment
Battery is replaceable
Cons
Fairly pricey
Despite having a durable design, it could get damaged if you drop it
Sonos' Move 2 portable speaker is a pretty straightforward product to review. That's because it improves upon its already very good predecessor in a couple of key ways. In addition to offering more spacious sound thanks to a new dual-tweeter acoustic architecture, it also delivers much improved battery life (up to 24 hours). Sonos also tossed is some modest design updates, including new touch controls. Alas, those upgrades come with a higher price -- the Move 2 with an included a wireless charging dock costs $449 (£449, AU$799), or $50 more than the original. But it's being sporadically discounted to $350, and if you can afford it, it's an excellent portable speaker that makes for a nice addition to your home's Sonos lineup, with the ability to travel more widely thanks to its Bluetooth support.

Top-sounding ultra compact Bluetooth speaker
Sony LinkBuds Bluetooth Speaker
Pros
Excellent sound for a very small speaker featuring a two-way speaker system (tweeter and woofer) for a fuller sound with punchy bass and good clarity
Can pair two LinkBuds together for impressive stereo sound
Impressive battery life (up to 25 hours)
Wireless charging cradle/dock included
Integrated carrying strap for portability
Auto switches audio with LinkBuds or Sony's 1000XM5 earbuds
Cons
Fairly pricey
LinkBuds naming can be confusing with LinkBuds headphones
Only splash-proof
Sony made some mistakes with its LinkBuds Bluetooth speaker. First, it launched it in its LinkBuds line with a couple of new LinkBuds, so it kind of got lost in the shuffle. Second, it's a little too expensive at its list price. But ignoring all that, I was surprised how good it sounded for its tiny size. It's easily among the best-sounding micro Bluetooth speakers out there and is equipped with a two-way speaker system featuring a dedicated tweeter and Sony's X-Balanced Speaker unit (woofer), giving it much fuller sound than you'd expect with punchy bass and good clarity. It's still a mono speaker, though you can pair two of them together for stereo sound. Battery life is also impressive. At moderate volume levels, it's rated for up to 25 hours of battery life. It also comes with it's own wireless charging dock, which clearly added some cost to the speaker, which is IPX4 splash-proof and comes in light gray or black. The LinkBuds Speaker gets its name from its ability to seamlessly take over ("auto switch") from your LinkBuds Fit, LinkBuds Open or LinkBuds S earbuds, as well as Sony's 1000XM5 earbuds, when you walk into your home and put your earbuds back in their case (your smartphone must be in Bluetooth range of the speaker). Also, your music will automatically switch from the speaker to your buds when you put the buds in your ears.

Best value alternative to Bose SoundLink Flex speaker
Tribit StormBox Flow
Pros
Impressive sound for its small size with excellent bass
Can be wirelessly paired with another StormBox for excellent stereo sound
Great value
Compact yet rugged design thats fully dust- and waterproof (IP67 rating) and can be positioned both flat and upright
Excellent battery life (up to 30 hours)
Cons
Design is slightly bland
Companion app isn't very intuitive
High-frequency sounds leave something to be desired
Tribit's StormBox Flow is another Bose SoundLink Flex knockoff for less that shares some similarities with the Soundcore Motion 300, including the same list price. The Tribit may sound slightly better than the Motion 300, edging it out for bass performance by a tad, but the Anker speaker wins on design.Like the Bose SoundLink Flex, the Tribit StormBox Flow can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up. You can also wirelessly pair two of the speakers together for stereo sound. It has an IP67 rating, which means it's dust-resistant and fully waterproof. Tribit says it delivers up to 30 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. That's impressive.  ... Show more

Upgraded JBL Flip Bluetooth speaker

Pros
Compact, rugged design thats fully dust- and waterproof (IP68)
Improved sound with more bass and volume and limited distortion at higher volume levels
New Push-Lock accessory system to swap between included carabiner and loop
Cons
Somewhat pricey
Sound quality is better on JBL's Charge 6
New for 2025. JBL hasn't drastically changed the design of its seventh-gen Flip portable Bluetooth speaker, which looks similar to its predecessor but has a new Push-Lock accessory system that allows you to swap between a carabiner and a loop (both are included). There are also some upgrades on the inside, including a newly developed woofer that helps improve bass performance. Like its big brother, the Charge 6, this fully waterproof and dust-proof (IP68) speaker is equipped with something called "AI Sound Boost," which JBL says keeps the speakers from distorting as their drivers are pushed to their "maximum capability." In other words, JBL has improved the speaker's digital processing with upgraded algorithms and the Flip 7 mostly manages to avoid distorting at higher volume levels. (I didn't find it distortion-free, though.)If sound quality is a priority, the large and more expensive Charge 6 is a better option (it does produce bigger sound with bass noticeably more bass). But, as I said, the 1.21-pound Flip 7's sound has been leveled up, and it remains one of the better-sounding speakers for its size, improving its standing against Bose's similarly priced SoundLink Flex, which received some small upgrades in 2024. Read our Flip 7 first take.

Best new compact Sony Bluetooth speaker
Sony ULT Field 3
Pros
Attractive styling
Very good sound for its relatively compact size
IP67 waterproof, dust-proof, and rust-proof
Good battery life
Cons
A little expensive
No charge-out port
I like the new designs of Sony's new-for-2025 ULT Field 3 and ULT Field 5 Bluetooth speakers, which can stand vertically or lay horizontally. Both speakers are fully waterproof, dust-proof, and rust-proof (IP67 certification) and offer significantly improved sound over their predecessors, with more bass and better overall clarity. Both also include a new removable shoulder strap; I used it more with the heftier ULT Field 5 than the lighter ULT Field 3, which is about half the size of its more-expensive sibling.Needless to say, the ULT Field 5 sounds better, delivering bigger sound with more bass. But the ULT Field 3 also delivers more bass and volume than you'd expect, given its relatively compact size (and it offers better clarity and bass performance than its predecessor, the SRS-XE300). Its battery life is also a little better (up to 24 hours at moderate volume levels), but it is missing the charge-out port found on ULT Field 5.  ... Show more

Pros
Excellent sound for a relatively compact speaker
Premium design with replaceable rope handle
Fully waterproof, dust-proof and shock-resistant
Up to 20 hours of battery life
USB-C port also charges out
Cons
Pricey
No speakerphone capabilities
When I first heard about the SoundLink Max, I was a little surprised Bose would put out a $399 Bluetooth speaker after the $149 SoundLink Flex speaker did so well. The Flex was so successful because it not only sounds good for its compact size but it doesn't cost that much, at least not for a Bose product. Not surprisingly, the 4.89-pound Max also sounds impressive -- it may just be the best-sounding for its size -- and has a premium design with a built-in rope handle that's replaceable (the Max is fully waterproof and dust-proof). It's a great Bluetooth speaker but its high price tag may turn some folks off.  ... Show more

Top value micro Bluetooth speaker
Soundcore by Anker Select Go 4
Pros
Very compact (weighs just 0.58 pounds)
Decent sound for its tiny size with non-tinny bass
Fully waterproof (IP67) and floats
Built-in strap for easy portability
Dual-device pairing ability for stereo sound
Impressive 20 hours of battery life
Cons
Looks and feels a tad cheap
Volume is limited due to speaker size
The Soundcore by Anker Select Go 4 doesn't have quite the build quality as JBL's Go 4 micro Bluetooth speaker (it has a slight budget feel to it), but it offers comparable sound quality and costs half the price. Like the JBL Go 4, the similarly named Select Go 4 sounds decent for its tiny size and is able to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Also, it's fully waterproof and even floats. Battery life is rated for an impressive 20 hours at moderate volumes and you can pair two of these speakers together for stereo sound. It's definitely a good value.

Best value Bluetooth boom box party speaker
Tribit Stormbox Blast 2
Pros
Improved design from original that's less boxy and generic looking with IP67 rating (dust- and water-proof)
More powerful sound than the original with upgraded dual 45W mid-range drivers, 80W subwoofer and two 15W tweeters
Loud, powerful bass with "bass boost" mode
Strong battery life (Up to 30 pounds) that can be charged with USB-C cable or included two-prong power cord
Customizable integrated light show
Two microphone inputs for karaoke (mics sold separately) and charge out port
Cons
Too large to be truly portable (15.8 pounds)
Battery life is limited when volume is high, which may defeat the "party" use case
In 2024, Tribit released a second-gen version of its popular Stormbox Blast Bluetooth boom box speaker. The Stormbox Blast 2 has an upgraded design -- it's less boxy and generic looking than the original -- along with upgraded speaker drivers and two inputs for wired microphones for karaoke (the microphones are sold separately). The speaker is quite beefy, weighing in at 15.8 pounds, and it's rated for 200W of power, with an 80W subwoofer, dual 45W mid-range drivers and two 15W tweeters.This thing plays loud, has powerful bass (I mainly kept the bass boost mode engaged) and measures up well against more premium Bluetooth boom box speakers from JBL and Sony that cost about twice as much. Like the original, this also has a light show component -- it's customizable or can be turned off -- and the speaker is fully waterproof with an IP67 rating. While the Stormbox Blast 2 is rated for an impressive 30 hours of battery at moderate volume levels and the light show off, battery life does drop significantly when you really crank the volume. Also worth noting: there's a charge out port, and interestingly, the speaker can be charged with a USB-C cable or the included two-prong power cord.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Very good sound for its small size (1.76 pounds) with stereo capabilities and strong midrange and treble and a bass-boost button for low-end amplification
Compact, waterproof (IPX7) design that can lay flat or be propped up thanks to SmartTune technology
Robust feature set including support for LDAC codec and speakerphone abilities
Cons
Doesn't sound as good as competitors' options
Sounds slightly overdriven with bass boost on
Bose makes its excellent SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker that sells for about $150 and sometimes goes on sale for less. The Soundcore Motion 300 is Anker's answer to that Bose speaker. Around the same size as the Bose, it doesn't sound quite as good but it sounds impressive for its compact size and lists for only $80 (it's been on sale for as low as $55). Like the SoundLink Flex, it can be laid down flat with its speaker firing up toward the ceiling or propped up as shown in the photo above. It's IPX7 waterproof and delivers up to 13 hours of audio at moderate volume levels. There's also support for Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android and other devices that support Bluetooth wireless streaming with LDAC. The speaker has a bass boost button that does amp up the low-end a bit. But I actually thought the speaker sounded a little better without the bass-boost engaged because the speaker seemed slightly overdriven with the boost.   ... Show more

Pros
Attractive design that's compact and light (weighs less than one pound) and also fully dust- and waterproof (IP67)

Sonos's original Roam speaker sounded very good for its compact size, but many users complained that it was tricky to go from Wi-Fi mode at home and Bluetooth mode on the go. With the release of the new Roam 2, which comes in five color options, those connectivity issues go away. The reality is the Roam 2 isn't much of an upgrade. It has the same acoustic architecture (and the same impressive sound for its size), but now it has two buttons -- one for power and the other for Bluetooth -- instead of a single power button. That Bluetooth button lets you pair the speaker with any Bluetooth-enabled audio device right out of the box. Previously, the setup was more convoluted and required you to connect to your Sonos home Wi-Fi network first.  ... Show more

Best mini Bluetooth speaker with strong bass
Sony ULT Field 1
Pros
Full, balanced sound profile
Speakerphone capabilities for great voice call usage
Lightweight and compact design
Cons
Limited sound profile without engaging the ULT button
Sony launched the SRS-XB23 a few years ago and it was a fairly popular portable Bluetooth speaker. The lightweight and compact ULT Field 1 sort of looks like a cross between the XB23 and the newer SRS-XE200. It sounds significantly better than the XB23, which had bass forward sound but just didn't offer enough clarity and detail for my tastes. The ULT Field 1 sounds fuller and more balanced and competes favorably with JBL's popular Flip 6, which lists for the same price.The speaker comes in four colors: off-white, orange, black and forest gray, and it's waterproof and dust-proof, with an IP67 rating. It also has speakerphone capabilities and is rated for up to 12 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.When you press the ULT button, you get a bass boost and overall fuller sound. Unlike with the ULT button on the Wear headphones that I thought boosted the bass too much, in the case of the Field 1, the speaker didn't have enough bass unless the ULT button was engaged.  ...

Ultimate Ears Everboom
Pros
Attractively designed and fairly compact (2.1 pounds) for travel-friendly listening
Excellent sound for its size with punchy bass and nice detail
Fully waterproof and dust-proof (IP67 rating) and floats for outdoor use
Good battery life (up to 20 hours)
Links with other UE Boom speakers for impressive volume or stereo sound
Cons
Fairly pricey
Not too long ago, Ultimate Ears released its higher-end Epicboom Bluetooth speaker, which sounds very good but is pretty pricey at $300 and somewhat large. The newer Everboom is about half the size, weighing in at 2.1 pounds (the Epicboom weighs 4.36 pounds), and more travel-friendly. It can't produce as much sound or bass as the Epicboom, but it does play relatively loud, and I was in some ways more impressed with its sound than the Epicboom's. By that I mean for its size, it's one of the best-sounding speakers out there, delivering punchy bass and nicely detailed sound.Fully waterproof (it floats) and dustproof with an IP67 rating, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and can be wirelessly linked up with most of UE's current family of Boom Bluetooth speakers, which includes the Boom 4, Megaboom 4, Epicboom and Hyperboom. Alas, the only strike against it is its relatively high price tag ($250).

Mini Bluetooth speaker with impressive sound quality
Harman Kardon Luna
Pros
Clear, natural sound and punchy bass with dual-driver design that features a woofer and a tweeter and rivals competitors like the JBL Flip 6 and Charge 5
Attractive, compact design (weighs 1.5 pounds)
Fully dust- and waterproof (IP67 rating) with a 12 hour battery life and Bluetooth 5.3
Cons
Slightly expensive
No companion app
Harman Kardon, which is owned by Samsung, makes popular JBL Bluetooth speakers like the Flip 6 and JBL Charge. The under-the-radar Harman Kardon Luna may just be the best mini Bluetooth speaker you've never heard of. It's not only attractively designed -- it comes in black or white -- but sounds surprisingly good for its size, with clear, natural sound and punchy bass (it's a mono speaker with a dual-driver design that features a woofer and a tweeter).It's slightly bigger than JBL's Flip series speakers and slightly smaller than the JBL Charge series, but the Luna's got a bit of heft to it, weighing in at 1.56 pounds (0.71 kg). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, it's also fully waterproof and dustproof, with an IP67 rating. Battery life is rated at up to 12 hours at moderate volume levels. I did find it to be a better-sounding speaker than the JBL Flip 6 and preferred it in some ways to the JBL Charge 5.  ... Show more

Tribit XSound Plus 2
Pros
Excellent sound with 30-watt rating and ample bass
Compact, portable design (1.28 pounds) with a removable lanyard that's fully waterproof (IPX7 rating) for portable listening and outdoor use
Bluetooth 5.3 and "party mode" capabilities to connect to other Tribit speakers for stereo sound and louder volume
Companion app is useful and intuitive to tweak EQ settings
Speakerphone capabilities for voice calls

Cons
Design is a little generic looking
Sound profile can be slightly uneven
The Tribit XSound Plus 2 is the successor to the similarly priced MaxSound Plus, which was a very good value. The XSound Plus 2 plays a little louder (it has a 30-watt vs. 24-watt power rating) and also has a slightly better battery (up to 24 hours at 50% volume vs. 20 hours). Additionally, this speaker is equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 and is able to connect to the Tribit app and link up in party mode with Tribit's XSound Plus 2, StormBox Flow and StormBox 2 Bluetooth speakers.The speaker, which weighs in at 1.28 pounds, does play quite loud for its size and delivers an ample amount of bass. The sound can be a bit uneven (the speaker sounds very good with some tracks and a little brash with others), but you can tweak the sound profile with some EQ settings, including three preset sound modes built into the speaker itself.Overall, the speaker seems pretty durable and has a removable lanyard and an IPX7 rating, which means it's fully waterproof. It does have speakerphone capabilities as well as an auxiliary input.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Good sound for its ultracompact size and modest price
Waterproof and dustproof (IP67)
Integrated strap
USB-C charging in/out with 12 hours of battery life
Cons
Not as durable as Bose SoundLink Micro
Distorts slightly at higher volumes with certain tracks
In 2020, Tribit released the StormBox Micro, a budget version of Bose's excellent SoundLink Micro speaker that delivered surprisingly good sound for its size and modest price. The second-gen StormBox Micro 2 offers improved sound and battery life, along with a charge-out feature that turns the speaker into a power bank for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. An integrated strap allows you to clip it to your backpack or your bike's handlebars.Like the original, it's an excellent value and easy to recommend if you're looking for a super-compact portable wireless speaker. It does cost $60 but sometimes goes on sale for closer to $50.  ... Show more

Best value mini boom box speaker with premium look
Soundcore by Anker Motion X600
Pros
Premium look and feel
Spatial audio features and LDAC codec support
Built-in handle and auxiliary input
Soundcore companion app is intuitive and well-designed
Cons
Default sound isn't great (need to engage bass boost and spatial audio)
Some may find it slightly too heavy for a portable speaker
Anker's Soundcore Motion X600 mini boom box not only has a premium look and feel with a metal grille and carrying handle, but includes some interesting features like spatial audio and support for Sony's LDAC audio codec. It sounds impressive for its relatively compact size and is a good value.Weighing 4.2 pounds (1.9 kg), it has some heft to it but it's light enough to carry around without feeling like you're getting a workout. The speaker is available in gray, green and blue and is equipped with five drivers, including two woofers, two tweeters and one full-range, upward-firing driver "in a unique speaker array that combined with Soundcore's audio algorithm and DSP helps create a wide (and tall) soundstage for listening to any type of music," according to Anker. It's rated for 50 watts of total power, with two 20-watt amps devoted to the woofers and tweeters and a third 10-watt amp powering the upward-firing driver.At the default sound setting without bass boost or spatial audio engaged, I wasn't exactly wowed with sound quality (the bass is a bit underwhelming, the mids are recessed and there's a bit too much treble push). But as soon as you engage the bass boost and spatial audio, everything sounds more balanced and full. You can also tweak the sound profile further in the Soundcore companion app for iOS and Android.   ... Show more

Best mid-range Bluetooth boombox
Soundcore by Anker Boom 2 Plus
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Impressive sound with fairly compact design
Competes well against more expensive boom box speakers
Charges via USB-C and has charge-out power bank option
Fully waterproof and floats for beach or pool parties
LED lighting
Cons
Smaller Boom 2 costs considerably less and is a better overall value
No dust-resistance rating
I consider the smaller Boom 2 the best value among current Soundcore by Anker Bluetooth speakers because it delivers very strong sound for a speaker that costs a little more than $100. But the larger and more expensive Boom 2 Plus is a better-sounding speaker that plays louder and produces bigger sound with more bass. It costs about $250 and it competes well with boom box speakers from JBL and Sony that cost upward of $400.This speaker has dual 50W woofers and dual 20W tweeters, Anker says, and charges via USB-C, which is nice. There is also a charge-out option to charge your devices and the Boom 2 Plus is rated for up to 20 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels. The speaker has a handle and removable strap to make it easy to carry around and is IPX7 waterproof. It also floats should you drop it in a body of water and has a customizable light show option.  ... Show more

Best Bluetooth speaker with built-in carabiner
JBL Clip 5
Pros
Good sound for its compact design
Slightly improved sound from predecessor
Redesigned carabiner
Improved battery life
Waterproof and dust-proof
Cons
Slightly expensive when not on sale
Can deliver only so much bass
The JBL Clip 5 has a redesigned carabiner with a "bigger and more accessible opening, making it easier to clip on anywhere." In my tests, the speaker ended up sounding slightly better than its predecessor, which JBL says is because the increased driver power allows for more "streamlined sound and consistent bass at every volume."Battery life is rated at 12 hours at moderate volume levels, and the speaker is equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with LE audio capabilities. It's IP67 waterproof and dustproof and has JBL Portable app support, along with multispeaker connectivity via Auracast. It's available in several colors.Read full review  ... Show more

Best durable mini Bluetooth speaker
Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Now has USB-C charging
Very good sound for its size with decent bass
Rugged design
Extended wireless range (40 meters)
Waterproof and dust-proof (and it floats)
Cons
Less slim than some micro Bluetooth speakers
Ultimate Ears' fourth-generation Wonderboom 4 offers some small improvements over its predecessor, including USB-C charging (finally) and a new Podcast EQ mode. Otherwise, the speaker is unchanged and sounds very similar with an identical battery life rating of 14 hours (at moderate volume levels) and a Bluetooth chip that allows for extended wireless range of more than 130 feet (40 meters). The design hasn't been altered either, although the speaker now comes in different colors.Like its predecessor, the Wonderboom 4 carries a list price of $100 but sometimes sells for a little less. Its IP67 rating means that it's not only waterproof but also dust-proof (and able to float).This model retains the Outdoor Boost mode that boosts treble and you can link two together (or pair up with a Wonderboom 3 or Wonderboom 2) to create a stereo pair by simply pressing a button on each speaker. Featuring very good sound for its small size, there's some decent punch to the bass (being short yet squat helps it produce more low end), but it can only deliver so much kick.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Very compact with an attractive design
Decent sound for its tiny size
Improved sound from predecessor
Durable carrying strap for on-the-go listening
Cons
Micro design can only deliver so much bass and volume
Pricer than the previous model
The fourth generation of JBL's smallest Bluetooth speaker not only has an upgraded design but it delivers slightly better sound and significantly better battery life -- up to 7 hours versus the JBL Go 3's 5 hours at moderate volume levels. The speaker can only deliver so much sound for its tiny size (don't get your expectations up too high), but it sounds better than you think given just how small it is (it truly fits in a pocket) and manages to output just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny. Available in multiple colors, the speaker is also durable and has an IP67 water-resistance rating, which means it can survive being submerged in water and is also dust-proof. All in all, it's one of the top micro Bluetooth speakers out there.

Best portable party speaker
JBL PartyBox 110
Pros
Big sound that packs some serious punch
Guitar and mic inputs
Built-in light show
Designed for horizontal or vertical listening with built-in handle
Bluetooth or wired USB connection
Can link to another PartyBox for stereo sound
Cons
Weighs 23 pounds
Only splash-proof rather than water-resistant or water-proof
No dust resistance rating
Released in 2021, the PartyBox 110 packs some serious punch and delivers bigger sound than many portable boombox speakers, including JBL's own Boombox 3. There's an integrated handle for toting the speaker, but the PartyBox 110 is pretty hefty, weighing in at 23 pounds and measuring slightly more than 22 inches tall. You can stand this Bluetooth boom box up vertically as shown in the picture above or place it horizontally, as it has rubber feet on both sides of the speaker.It's rated for up to 12 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels and has a redesigned light show that syncs to the beat of your music (you can customize the light show from the speaker itself or use the JBL PartyBox companion app). The speaker has Bluetooth or a wired USB connection and there are guitar and mic inputs. It's also worth noting that the speaker is IPX4 splash-proof and you can wirelessly link two PartyBox 110 speakers together for stereo sound.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing a Bluetooth speaker
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new Bluetooth speaker. Value-priced wireless speakers continue to improve, so you can find good "cheap" Bluetooth speakers from Chinese brands like Tribit for not too much money (less than $60). If you're looking for a more premium speaker, you can expect to pay $100 or more, especially for larger portable speakers that deliver better sound.SizeBigger speakers tend to sound better, delivering a bigger sound with more bass. Going bigger means they weigh more, which can make them a little harder to carry around. So you have to balance size with performance if you're looking for something that's easily portable. If you're interested in a larger portable speaker, one feature worth looking out for is a built-in handle.DurabilityMany Bluetooth speakers are now fully waterproof and some are fully dustproof. If you're planning on taking the speaker with you to the beach, pool party or hiking trip, having a more durable speaker is a desirable trait.Speakerphone capabilitiesSome speakers have a built-in microphone that turns them into a speakerphone when making calls on your cell phone. Many speakers don't offer that feature, so choose accordingly if that's something you're looking for. If you're looking for more speakers that fit this bill, check out our roundup of the best speakerphones here.
How we test Bluetooth speakers
In assessing what the best Bluetooth speakers are, we consider six key criteria. These criteria include design, durability, sound quality, battery life, extra features and value. We test everything from compact mini models and pocket-size micro versions to heftier models with powerful audio. For more, check out our lists of the best smart speakers, best PC speakers and the best Wi-Fi speakers and music systems.DesignEvaluating design, we first assess how comfortable the speaker is to carry, position and adjust (their ergonomics), including grip surfaces and carrying handles or straps. We also measure and weigh each speaker to assess how easily it can be transported. Then we consider visual aesthetics, noting available colorways and finishes and how the speaker looks in different environments. DurabilityWe test the durability of each speaker in both indoor and outdoor environments to simulate real-life conditions. We stress test ports and buttons, cycling through physical controls and repeatedly connecting/disconnecting cables to assess long-term reliability. We also verify IP (dust- and water-resistance) ratings when applicable and examine all external materials for signs of potential wear or degradation. Sound qualityWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the speaker to top competing products in their price range. Some of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit. Tested sonic traits include:Frequency responseTonal balanceSoundstage width and depthBass response and controlOutdoor performanceDistortion testingBattery lifeBecause battery life can be affected by volume, we test each speaker at both moderate and high volumes to provide a realistic assessment. We also measure how long the speaker takes to reach a full charge using all available charging equipment, including USB-C, micro-USB, proprietary connectors and wireless charging where applicable.Extra featuresSome great-sounding Bluetooth speakers aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from voice assistant integration (Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri, for example) to speakerphone abilities. We also also test multi-speaker capabilities, or "party modes," that allow stereo pairing and multi-room functions. Models with Bluetooth multipoint, or the ability to connect to several devices at once, are also noted within the "additional details" section of each product. We also take a look at the companion app for the speaker if there is one evaluate for stability, user-friendliness and useful features like EQ adjustment, firmware updates and speaker finding. ValueWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the Bluetooth speaker against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.
Other Bluetooth speakers we tested
Tribit Stormbox Lava: Tribit's new-for-2025 Stormbox Lava speaker can be best described as a poor man's JBL Xtreme 4 speaker. It doesn't sound as good as that JBL speaker, which costs $380. The Lava looks a little generic, but it does output a lot of sound with pretty powerful bass and costs a lot less (a removable shoulder strap and carrying handle are included). This is not the most refined-sounding speaker -- it lacks some clarity -- but if big sound is what you're after in a boombox-style speaker, the affordable Stormbox Lava fits the bill. With an IP67 dust- and waterproof rating, it also seems pretty durable and offers up to 24 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels. As for extra features, there's a charge-out port, and you can link multiple Tribit speakers in party or stereo mode and tweak the sound via the Tribit app for iOS and Android.Marshall Middleton: With Marshall recently releasing the Middleton in 2025, the original Middleton speaker is being discounted. It isn't exactly compact, but tt also isn't so beefy that you get a workout carrying it around. Weighing 4 pounds (1.8kg), it's bigger than Marshall's Emberton speaker and smaller and more portable than its Kilburn II speaker. Any way you look at it, it sounds very good for its size and puts out a surprising amount of quality bass while offering good treble detail and natural-sounding mids (where vocals live). I also liked that it has equalizer controls on the speaker itself and is fully waterproof and dustproof with an IP67 rating.Sony SRS-XB100: Sony's smallest Bluetooth speaker was once again modestly upgraded in 2023, with a new Bluetooth chipset, slightly improved sound and speakerphone performance. This portable Bluetooth speaker is both dust- and waterproof with an IP67 certification and, like its predecessor (the SRS-XB13), it's rated for 16 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and charges via USB-C. Equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with support for the AAC and SBC audio codecs, the speaker plays bigger than you'd think for its small size, with some punch to its bass. It's pretty impressive for a mini mono speaker.JBL Clip 4: JBL has released the newer Clip 5, which features slightly better sound and a new carabiner design. But the Clip 4 is still a very good micro Bluetooth speaker and can be had at a discount.JBL Flip 6: As JBL has launched the newer Flip 7, which has improved sound and a little better battery life, the Flip 6 is being discounted. While it doesn't sound as good as its successor, the Flip 6 is still a good Bluetooth speaker that offers good sound quality in a rugged design (it's IP67 waterproof and dust-resistant) -- and it doesn't look much different from the Flip 7. JBL Charge 5: I still like the Charge 5, which also comes in a more expensive WiFi version, but JBL has released the improved Charge 6. That said, with that newer model available, we're seeing some nice discounts on the older Charge 5. At that right price, it is worth considering.Sonos Roam: Available in white or black for $179, the Roam is currently the smallest and most affordable Sonos speaker (if you don't count those $99 Sonos-compatible Symfonisk Ikea Wi-Fi bookshelf speakers), although it's fairly expensive for a mini wireless speaker. This Sonos Roam model, like the bigger Sonos Move 2 portable speaker, is equipped with both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and can tap into an existing Sonos multiroom audio system and link with other Series 2-compatible Sonos speakers. Learn more about the Sonos Roam with our hands-on review. Tribit XSound Go: Despite being on the market for several years, the Tribit XSound Go remains one of the top Bluetooth speakers for the money. Besides sounding decent for streaming your favorite music and more, this affordable Bluetooth speaker is also fully waterproof. It has had some small upgrades over the years. Read our full review of the Tribit XSound Go to find out more. JBL Pulse 5: JBL's Pulse speaker is now in its fifth generation, and both the sound quality and 360-degree light show have been improved. JBL has "expanded the transparent outer body" so the customizable light show looks more impressive. (There's a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to alter the colorful lighting effects.) The speaker is also IP67 dust-proof and waterproof, and it offers up to 12 hours of battery at moderate volume levels. I did a full review of the JBL Pulse 5 in January of 2023, and it still holds as an excellent speaker option.Anker Motion Boom: Anker's more expensive Soundcore Motion Boom Plus (see above) is a substantial sound upgrade over the original Motion Boom but this model remains a very good mini boom box for the money. Equipped with a handle and weighing a little over 4 pounds, the speaker reminds me of one of those giant flashlights or "floating lanterns" that were in vogue about 30 years ago. For the record, the Motion Boom actually does float and is fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. Find out more in our full Anker Motion Boom review. UE Hyperboom: Ultimate Ears' Boom Bluetooth speakers come in a few different sizes, but none of them are as big as the Hyperboom. A supersize wireless speaker that tips the scales at a hefty 13 pounds, the Hyperboom makes the UE Megaboom 3 look unquestionably puny. It's not cheap, but its sound quality is better than a lot of the jumbo portable speakers on the market right now. Read our full review of the UE Hyperboom.Marshall Willen: Marshall's little mono Willen speaker is similar to Bose's SoundLink Micro and other micro speakers like the Tribit StormBox Micro 2. Also like those speakers, it has an integrated strap on its base so you can clip it onto a backpack or even to your bike's handlebars. Its 2-inch full-range driver and two passive radiators put out more sound than you'd think it would for its tiny size, and it offers decent clarity as well as just enough bass to avoid sounding tinny (you can choose from three preset sound modes).Bang & Olufsen Beosound A1 (2nd Gen): A couple of years ago, Bang & Olufsen upgraded its dome-shaped aluminum-clad A1 speaker with improved battery life, better speakerphone performance (it now has a three-microphone array) and slightly improved sound. It's not only the smallest wireless speaker from the Danish company, it's technically the most affordable. You can learn more about the small-but-mighty B&O Beousound A1 in our full review. Bose SoundLink Micro: Although a little pricey and due to be upgraded, the Bose SoundLink Micro sounds remarkably decent for its tiny size, delivering more bass than other pocketable speakers. It's a fully waterproof Bluetooth speaker and is available in three color options, although the blue version appears to be hard to find. I tested the speaker in 2018 and rated it an 8.3 out of 10 in the Bose SoundLink Micro review. Anker Soundcore Motion Plus: Anker's Soundcore Motion Plus came out in 2019, but it remains one of the best-sounding speakers for around $100. It's larger than many mini Bluetooth speakers, but it's still compact. It manages to sound quite a bit fuller than much of the competition in its price range, with bigger bass, more volume and better clarity. It's also fully waterproof (IPX7-rated) and has support for the aptX streaming codec for devices like Samsung's Galaxy phones that support it. Read more in my Anker Soundcore Motion Plus review. Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore: It's a little overpriced for the sound quality it delivers, but the Beosound Explore is a very good little speaker that has a sleek, eye-catching design, is fully waterproof and dustproof (IP67 rating), and offers excellent battery life, with up to 27 hours of music listening at moderate volume levels.Monoprice Soundstage 3
(Out of Stock): Monoprice tends to make pretty generic-looking electronic products, and its understated Soundstage 3 Bluetooth speaker probably isn't going to wow you with its design although its minimalist aesthetic has its appeal. It's a good value thanks to its ability to play big sound with strong bass and decent clarity, with 50 watts of power that drives a 5.25-inch "concave aluminum cone woofer" flanked by two 1-inch silk-dome tweeters. It also has good connectivity options, including digital optical, 3.5mm analog and RCA analog wired inputs that allow you to connect your television or another stereo component. There's also a sub-out port.Tribit XSound Mega
(Out of Stock): Over the last few years, Tribit has made several Bluetooth speakers that deliver a lot of boom for the buck. Add its new XSound Mega to the list. Tribit is billing the XSound Mega as more of an outdoor speaker — a lanyard is included for toting it around as a sort of mini boombox — but it works just fine indoors. It has an LED light show that you can turn on or off and there are three EQ settings for sound: XBass, Music and Audiobook. Additionally, it can be used as a power bank to charge your mobile devices.Tribit StormBox
(Out of Stock): The StormBox looks like a cross between a UE and a JBL speaker. We suspect that's not an accident. This fully waterproof speaker costs significantly less than the JBL Flip 5 and Flip 6 and produces a bigger sound. Its rechargeable battery offers up to 20 hours of battery life for playing music and more. Tribit's XSound speakers are probably a better value, but the StormBox is more stylish. Bluetooth speaker FAQs
How do I choose a Bluetooth speaker?
When choosing a Bluetooth speaker, it comes down to size and price. If you're looking for a very portable speaker, you'll want to get something very compact, but remember that smaller speakers usually produce less sound and bass than larger ones. There are plenty of mini Bluetooth speakers that deliver a bigger sound than you might expect, but they do have their sonic limitations. For a lot of people, it's a question of finding a speaker that's not too big or too small -- one that travels well but also is capable of producing good sound for its size. Finding the best portable Bluetooth speaker also comes down to your budget.Price can be a limiting factor. You may not want to spend $150 or more for a small speaker. Luckily, there are plenty of good options for $100, and some decent mini Bluetooth speakers can cost less than $50. Also, certain "value" brands that sell primarily on Amazon are strongly worth considering because they do offer a lot for the money.If you're looking for the best sound quality, as I said, bigger is usually better, and some larger portable Bluetooth speakers -- sometimes referred to as Bluetooth boom boxes -- can put out a lot of sound and have an integrated handle for toting them around.

How do I connect a Bluetooth speaker to my TV?
Well, first of all, you need a TV, video streaming device or set-top cable or satellite box that has Bluetooth. You connect a Bluetooth speaker just like you do Bluetooth earbuds: through the Bluetooth settings menu on your TV or those aforementioned devices (Apple TV, for instance, has Bluetooth connectivity, making it easy to connect your AirPods).The only issue with connecting a Bluetooth speaker to your TV is that there can be some audio-video syncing issues due to Bluetooth lag. In some cases, where your Bluetooth speaker has an audio input (a few high-end Bluetooth speakers even have digital audio inputs), you can use a wired connection to the speaker via the audio outputs on your TV. Soundbars tend to use the optical or HDMI connection on your TV to get sound. Many soundbars have a Bluetooth option so you can wirelessly stream music from your phone to the soundbar. So if you're looking to really build out the sound on your television, you may want to look into building a true home theater system or a great soundbar audio experience.

What is the loudest Bluetooth speaker?
The loudest Bluetooth speakers are the biggest ones. Sometimes they're referred to as boom boxes or "party" speakers. Some of those speakers are portable and have built-in rechargeable batteries while the biggest party speakers have wheels on them for transport and need to be plugged in with an AC adapter because they require so much power.We have a list of the best wireless boom box speakers if you're looking for a bigger Bluetooth speaker. It's also worth noting that Bluetooth speakers from the same company can be daisy-chained together to augment their sound or paired together as a left-right stereo pair. Often, the best way to get a bigger sound is to pair two Bluetooth speakers together in a stereo pair.

How much does a good Bluetooth speaker cost?
Quality Bluetooth speakers usually cost between $50 and $400. Budget-friendly options like the Anker Soundcore Motion 300 ($50-$80) offer decent sound quality for more casual listening. Mid-range Bluetooth speakers such as the JBL Flip 6 ($150-$200) can provide better audio fidelity and battery life for more serious listening.

Do I need a waterproof speaker?
Waterproof Bluetooth speakers are an excellent option if you plan to use your speaker outdoors, by the pool, at the beach or in the shower. Models with an IP rating of IPX3 or higher are protected against spraying or splashing water, while IPX7 ratings or higher can withstand full submersion in water for up to 30 minutes. Be sure to consider where you plan on bringing your Bluetooth speaker and take a look at the manufacturer's IP rating before you choose a model.
