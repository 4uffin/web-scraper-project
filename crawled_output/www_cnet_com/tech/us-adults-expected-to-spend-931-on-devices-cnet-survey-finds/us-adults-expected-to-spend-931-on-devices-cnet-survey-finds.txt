The holidays are still months away, but if you want the best deals on a new laptop or smartphone, you should probably start shopping now. According to a new CNET survey, nearly half of shoppers aren't waiting until Black Friday and Cyber Monday to shop. Instead, they're shopping for tech for the holidays months early to beat potential rising prices and shortages.But is shopping early the best strategy? I spoke with CNET's resident tech and shopping experts to find out.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Here's what they say you need to know about navigating early sales, finding the best deals and avoiding common pitfalls, like product shortages and hidden price hikes.
Key takeaways
Many US adults (59%) are interested in purchasing tech devices this holiday season. Smartphones (26%) and laptops (23%) are at the top of shoppers' lists. The average US shopper plans to spend $931.18 on tech devices this holiday season, and millennials plan to spend $139 more. Over half (59%) plan to shop Black Friday sales to save money on holiday tech purchases, followed by comparison shopping (37%). Half of shoppers plan to shop for tech early (August to October), but a quarter plan to shop in November. Nearly 9 in 10 (87%) have shopping concerns about purchasing consumer tech this holiday season, including rising prices and tariffs.
Shoppers plan to spend an average of $931 on tech this holiday seasonCNET found that US shoppers plan to spend an average of $931 on tech this holiday season, and a few devices top their shopping lists. The millennial generation expects to spend more, with an average of $1,070 on tech this holiday season. Gen X plans to spend the least, with $747.
Cole Kan/CNET/Getty ImagesSmartphones and laptops are at the top of holiday tech wish lists Smartphones (26%) and laptops (23%) are the top two tech gadgets most US adults are buying this holiday season. Between new features and popular releases, CNET experts shared why smartphones and laptops are sought after this year and what to know before you buy.
Cole Kan/CNET/Getty ImagesSmartphones New smartphone models, including the Google Pixel 10 and Apple's iPhone 17, are released months before the holidays. Some features, like Apple Intelligence and Gemini Nano, are limited to newer models. David Lumb, CNET's mobile expert and reporter, says that may persuade you to buy a new phone for the holidays. "It's probably the time of year when consumers' old phones start to feel long in the tooth -- and with new iPhones typically released in September, they may be tempted by their extra features and capabilities."But don't expect to see steep discounts on these newly released models in time for the holidays. Lumb says most brand-new phones released within the past few months won't have great holiday deals. Sometimes Samsung doesn't follow this trend, but Apple rarely discounts its phones. You may see a $100 discount on last year's iPhone when the new one is released. When's the best time to buy? If you're still planning to buy a new phone this year, November is the best time to look for one, especially during Black Friday and Cyber Monday week. Retailers will have the best deals then, but don't expect big discounts. Some phone carriers may offer trade-in offers, but comparing deals is still best. "The best way to save money on brand-new premium phones is to look for bundles and deals from carriers and third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon," Lumb says. "And make sure you're taking care of your old phone to get the most trade-in value, which can save you hundreds of dollars off a new one when you turn in your old one."There are still a few popular budget-friendly smartphones if you're looking for a good deal but don't need the latest and greatest. "While this year's new iPhone 16E stretches the idea of 'budget' at $600, the $429 iPhone SE released in 2022 remains the most affordable iOS phone," Lumb says. "Android fans have far more options around the same price range, like the $499 Google Pixel 9A or $400 Samsung Galaxy A36, and into true budget territory with the $300 Moto G Power 5G, $250 TCL 60 XE NxtPaper 5G and $200 Samsung Galaxy A16." Laptops Deals are available on several types of laptops, including budget-friendly options and high-performance gaming models. Depending on your needs, you can choose from plenty of laptops, but CNET recommends the M4 MacBook Air or the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7. Before you buy a laptop this holiday season, Josh Goldman, CNET's laptop expert and managing editor, recommends setting a budget and expectations first. "The best move is to set a budget, try to stick to it and look at deals from retailers and direct from the manufacturers," Goldman says. Most importantly, make sure you're getting a laptop with the features and specifications you need now and in the foreseeable future. When's the best time to buy? Goldman says if Amazon follows its usual fall Prime Day sale, you should start to see good deals on computers then. Deals are expected to continue through Black Friday and the week of Cyber Monday. You can find the lowest laptop prices during Black Friday,  but there are sales throughout the year. "Unless you're buying one as a gift or have an urgent need, another sale is always just around the corner," Goldman says.TVs are also on holiday shopping lists One in five (20%) shoppers is considering buying TVs this holiday season. While CNET tracks weekly TV deals and lists the best TVs of this year, it's still a prime time to buy now. When's the best time to buy? David Katzmaier, CNET's resident TV expert and senior editorial director, says the best time to start shopping for one is usually around Black Friday. Deals will continue through the holiday season, leading up to the Super Bowl in February. You may still find deals during the fall Prime Day or other early sales. Katzmaier recommends using a price tracker, like Keepa, for historical pricing and to spot a good deal. Keepa is one of several websites with a browser extension to track Amazon product prices. Experts also recommend CamelCamelCamel. "That way, when it goes on sale, you know how deep the discount really is and you can pounce if it's a good deal. Waiting is usually the best strategy and when the TV hits an all-time low, go for it," Katzmaier says. However, the more substantial discounts are usually on the more expensive TV options because they cost more, but you can still find good offers on other models. "The best deals we find are often midpriced models -- neither super budget nor really high-end -- that go on sale during Black Friday," Katzmaier says. "Those are also the kinds of TVs that do the best in our reviews."Shoppers are concerned about buying tech for the holidays Nearly nine in 10 (87%) of shoppers are worried about purchasing tech this holiday season. By the numbers, over half (52%) are worried about tariffs and rising prices on tech they plan to buy, while 48% worry about finding quality tech at an affordable price. Other concerns include shoppers being able to afford new tech (38%), going into debt or straining their finances to purchase devices (26%) and availability and shortages (23%). The concerns are valid. Holiday tech shopping may not be smooth sailing for some popular tech devices, like video gaming consoles and smartphones. Here's a closer look and what CNET experts are seeing.Over half of shoppers are worried about rising prices and tariffs With over half of shoppers worried about rising prices and tariffs, Russell Holly, CNET's shopping expert and director of commerce, has seen plenty of evidence that suggests tariffs on personal electronics and home tech will affect prices during sales this year. However, you can get ahead of some price hikes on personal and home tech essentials. "Things like AA batteries, replacement batteries for AirTags and even kitchen necessities like dishwasher tabs will reduce possible price gouging later," Holly says. Goldman says that it's less about tariffs for many retailers. There are other economic factors impacting prices."We've seen some small price increases, but several manufacturers we've asked about the impact of tariffs have said the increases are more about general inflation and that sometimes newer tech just costs more, which is true," Goldman says. "Sometimes you have to wait a couple of years for the latest and greatest to become more affordable." Nearly half are worried about finding tech at an affordable priceBridget Carey, CNET's consumer tech expert and editor, advised shopping with caution and not buying the first device you see, especially if you're concerned about finding quality devices at a good price. More paid social media influencers and AI-generated search results are skewing top recommendations, which may not be the best or accurate, she says. That's why she recommends taking an extra few minutes to do your research to save money and frustration from a device you're unhappy with."Before making a large purchase, it's more important this year to find reviews written by independent, trusted sources to weed out the junk -- or just to help you find the right brand for your needs," Carey adds. Expect shortages on popular tech itemsSome popular newly released items may face shortages this holiday shopping season, especially if there's a good deal. That's a concern that nearly 1 in 4 (23%) have. If there's a must-have item on your list, like the highly anticipated iPhone 17 or the Nintendo Switch 2, don't wait to buy it if it's in stock and you can afford it. That's because waiting for lower prices may mean missing out on the item altogether. For example, Carey predicts that the Nintendo Switch 2 may be tighter on supply as December approaches."Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser told CBS there would be a steady supply of Switch 2 units coming throughout the year. But our CNET Switch 2 restock tracker has found stores regularly going out of stock, so I would shop sooner rather than later to avoid disappointment," Carey says. Half of US adults are shopping for tech ahead of the holiday season
Cole Kan/CNET/Getty ImagesThinking about holiday shopping before Halloween may sound odd, but Carey recommends planning your shopping list now. "With the cost of tech increasing, you'll want to be prepared to jump on any sale you see in October and early November. Black Friday isn't just one weekend anymore — it starts in October." But you'll still want to keep an eye out for sales after October and pay attention to return policies just in case you find a better deal. CNET found that half of tech shoppers plan to shop early -- September and October -- to ease some of their shopping concerns. Still, most shoppers (25%) plan to wait until November, and 6% will wait until December. How US adults are trimming costs on consumer tech and servicesClose to nine in 10 (89%) shoppers plan to use various strategies. Shopping on Black Friday is the most popular money-saving method (59%). Other popular methods include comparison shopping (37%), shopping during Fall Prime Day and competing retailer sales (34%), shopping refurbished or pre-owned tech (23%) and shopping earlier (22%).If you're comparing prices, especially during sales, Holly advises making sure you're getting a deal. "Tools like CamelCamelCamel.com will show you the price history of a product, so you know whether the sale is genuine and how tariffs have affected the price over the course of this year," Holly says. "You can also verify discounts through CNET's Deals page, where we actively track discounts to make sure you're getting the lowest price."So when's the best time to buy tech and appliances?Holly adds that Black Friday sales focus on entertainment and popular gifts. It's also a good time to shop for TVs, eBikes and gaming accessories. Fall sales before Black Friday typically focus on home appliances, laptops and emergency preparedness. "The best strategy for making sure you're getting the best deals is to prioritize more practical life improvements first and be ready for entertainment purchases closer to the end of the year," said Holly. Methodology CNET commissioned YouGov Plc to conduct the survey. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. The total sample size was 2,395 US adults, of whom 1,369 were interested in purchasing consumer tech products or services this winter holiday season. Fieldwork was undertaken Aug. 20-22, 2025. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18+).
