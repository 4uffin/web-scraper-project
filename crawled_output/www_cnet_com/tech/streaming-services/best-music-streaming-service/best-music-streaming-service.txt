What to consider
Price
If you prefer a monthly subscription, consider how much want to pay for access to music, full albums, podcasts and other content. Additionally, you may pay less money if you're eligible for a student deal, or you'll pay more if your household needs a family plan so everyone can stream.
Sound quality
Depending on what devices you're using to listen, the availability of features like Dolby Atmos or spatial audio may determine your streaming service preference. Whether you're listening in your car, phone or home theater speakers, check if lossless and other high-quality features are included and/or supported.
Music purchases
Some music lovers want to buy digital songs or entire albums, but not every service offers that option. Apple Music, Qobuz and Amazon Music are your primary choices for that.

Compare
Back to selection
Today's audio streaming services offer a tantalizing mix of convenience and music discovery, giving you easy access to your favorite tunes while helping you unearth new gems. Sound quality is even better than ever, and many of the paid subscriptions include spatial Dolby Atmos audio and/or lossless for free. It's not just about music anymore, either. Audiobooks and podcasts have become the next must-have features, with Spotify and Amazon Music including both as part of their monthly fees. I've tested all the major services and compared all the relevant features, along with a full price breakdown. Let's dive in. Our Picks

Music streaming FAQs
What is the best music streaming service overall?When choosing a music streaming service, it's a close race between two in particular: Spotify Premium and Apple Music. Both services boast extensive catalogs and plenty of features, but there is a clear winner. Despite a price increase to $12 a month, Spotify is the best streaming service for most people. It offers the best mix of features, including lossless, audiobooks, Spotify Connect streaming and great community offerings such as Spotify Wrapped. Spotify also offers the best free tier: Without paying a dime or providing a credit card number, you can listen to millions of tunes and stream to Wi-Fi devices.For Apple device users, the excellent Apple Music is hot on Spotify's tail with potential for even better sound due to the inclusion of spatial music, and it's a dollar cheaper. Although the company has made strides in recent years, a few bricks of the former walled garden remain, and it's not as recommendable to Android or PC users. Spotify is still a better choice for users of both iOS and Android. Lastly, if you're an audiophile -- or simply love music -- then both Tidal and Qobuz offer excellent sound quality at realistic prices. Of those two, Tidal has taken pains to remove the proprietary MQA format and offer a cheaper fee, while Qobuz offers a point of difference in its download store.Read more: Apple Music vs. Spotify: Comparing the Top Music Streaming ServicesBest music streaming services of 2025

Best music streaming service overall
Spotify
Pros
Lossless music on Premium for no extra charge
Free version is robust
Spotify Connect simplifies connection to devices
Great playlist features including live "Jam"
Cons
Free-service ads can be intrusive
Podcast integration is awkward
Hard to find a non-audiobook option
Spotify is a pioneer in music streaming and is arguably the best-known service. It offers several curated music discovery services, including its Discover Weekly playlist, and is constantly implementing new ones, such as Stations, an AI DJ, audiobooks and podcasts. After years of waiting, Spotify is finally rolling out lossless music for no extra charge.Though it may not be lossless (yet), Spotify is great if you're seeking a solid all-around service, especially one that lets you make, browse and share playlists for any occasion. The company's year-end Wrapped is an institution and it has spawned "best of" imitations from most of the company's competitors. It's worth noting that Spotify has undergone some price changes in the last 18 months which coincided with the addition of audiobooks. The service now costs $12 in the US, £12 in the UK and AU$14 in Australia. The company does have a book-free tier for $11, but it's available only to current and "eligible" customers, but this appears to be a very select group. There's also an ad-supported free version of Spotify, and the student rate costs $6 per month.  ... Show more

Best alternative to Spotify
Apple Music
Pros
Spatial and hi-res music included
Combines your iTunes library with music you don't own, with a choice of music lockers
Human music experts and algorithms help find music you'll want to hear based on what you play
Tight integration with Apple HomePod and iOS devices
Cons
Not as fun for Android or PC users
At the same price as Spotify, Apple Music offers a lot for the money, including 100 million tracks and iOS and Android compatibility. The service runs second to Spotify in terms of subscribers but surpasses its rival in that it has hi-res lossless and spatial audio albums, plus classical music app at no extra charge.Though it makes the most sense if you're an Apple user, Music is an option if you're listening on a PC, Android, or have invested in smart speakers -- including those from Google. If you own an Apple HomePod, Mini or Nest device, you can summon Apple Music tracks with your voice. The service also features a ton of curated playlists, many handcrafted by musicians and tastemakers, although the service lacks the robust sharing options (or some of the cool add-ons) available to Spotify users. If you're looking to move to Apple Music from its main rival Spotify, then Apple has released a tool which enables you to swap your libraries from one to the other.  ...

Best for serious music fans
Tidal
Pros
High-fidelity music streams, including Dolby Atmos surround mixes
Lots of video content, including concert livestreams
Profiles and record reviews on every page, plus up-and-coming artist spotlights
Cons
The mobile apps and web player aren't as straightforward as some others
The catalog isn't as exhaustive as Spotify Premium
Most high-res music uses MQA, which needs a specialized decoder
Though Tidal quietly did away with its free service, it also scrapped its $20 Hi-Fi Plus tier in favor of an all-inclusive $11 plan instead -- this means hi-res music for everybody. It's worth noting that the service is (still) replacing its proprietary MQA files with hi-res FLAC for better compatibility. The service also boasts an impressive number of tracks -- more than most competitors -- at 110 million songs. If you're an audiophile, a fan of urban music, or a mix of both, then Tidal offers a great catalog and a very attractive price.  ... Show more

Best for audiophiles who want to buy albums
Qobuz
Pros
The app is really clean and fun to use
Ability to listen to 24-bit music without needing a specialized decoder
Download store as well
Cons
No spatial audio
Qobuz's streaming service offers a wealth of music in hi-res, and you don't need a special hardware decoder to listen to it. The service offers two main plans: Studio Premier ($13 monthly or $130 yearly) and the $180 annual Sublime Plus. If you're a student, its new $5-a-month plan is a great value. Uniquely, the streaming service offers its own hi-res download store, and if you sign up for Sublime, you get a discount on purchases.In 2025, the company added Qobuz Connect, which enables users to stream from the app to their compatible hi-fi, and takes on similar functionality from Tidal and Spotify.At 100 million tracks, Qobuz's streaming catalog rivals Tidal's and Spotify's in number, and based on our tests, its catalog of more-obscure artists is now pretty impressive. Excellent sound quality at a decent price? Qobuz is our favorite service for serious music lovers who also want to be able to purchase tracks.  ... Show more

YouTube Music
YouTube Music ($11 a month) is the successor to Google Play Music, and if you sign up for the ad-free YouTube Premium at $14 a month, you get YouTube Music for free. The good news is that YouTube Music is a mostly impressive service (the lower bit rate of 256Kbps is mildly disappointing), but Google has retained the predecessor's music locker system enabling you to upload new tracks. In even better news, YouTube Music offers a clean interface with over 100 million tracks to choose from. YouTube Music offers well-curated radio stations that play endlessly and are updated often. The service also has the ability to make playlists out of YouTube music clips, which makes it a worthy option. Lastly, the Apple HomePod has joined Google's Nest devices in enabling users to set YouTube Music as the default.  ...

Best for Prime members
Amazon Music Unlimited
Pros
Cheaper than the top three if you're an Amazon Prime member
Lyrics automatically pop up on the "now playing" screen
Hi-res and spatial audio from Sony 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos at no extra charge
Offers free music stations for Amazon Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap (includes ads)
Cons
Artist profiles don't have biographies
The service no longer includes a music locker
While Amazon Prime Music comes "free" as part of a Prime membership, users can choose to upgrade to Music Unlimited for audiobooks and higher-quality music streams. At $11 for Prime members, or $12 if you don't have Prime, Unlimited offers an expanded catalog plus Atmos audio mixes which can be played on Dolby Atmos soundbars, Android or iOS devices, and the Amazon Echo Studio. In terms of usability, the Music Unlimited interface is also more powerful than before with playlists, genres and podcasts all accessible from the main page.  ... Show more

French stalwart Deezer has been operating in the US since 2016, and it has a lot to offer, including a free tier (mobile only) and an impressive 120 million tracks. It has more subscribers than some others on this list, thanks in part to its previous affiliation with Cricket Wireless. The main Premium plan is $12 a month, and users are also able to upgrade their audio quality within the app. Deezer also offers a couple of unique features, including being the first service to let users upload their catalogs from competitors at no extra charge.   ...

Factors to consider
James Martin/CNETThe principal thing you'll need to weigh is your monthly cost. Until recently, prices were stable at around $10 a month, but Apple Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Tidal, YouTube Music and Spotify have all hiked rates to $11 or more. While your subscription fee can give you access to a number of features -- including classical music, karaoke and podcasts -- what it can also do is unlock higher-quality audio. Sound quality is also an important consideration, and services such as Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited offer lossless and Dolby Atmos music at no extra charge. Meanwhile, Spotify now offers lossless music as part of the Premium subscription.With the addition of audiobooks, both Amazon Music and Spotify offer an additional point of difference over the other services.If you like to buy your own digital music, Apple Music and YouTube Music are the only services to offer a digital locker to store your existing library of songs, while Qobuz also offers a storefront (without a locker for existing libraries). How we test streaming services
We've checked out the big names, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music and Deezer, as well as smaller ones such as Tidal, Qobuz, Napster and Pandora Premium, to see how each platform stacks up for your subscription dollar. Most of the services feature music catalogs of around 100 million tracks and are supported by a host of different devices. Given that all of the services basically have the same libraries, we evaluated each one based on: Ease of useCostFeaturesSound qualityWhile YouTube Music offers objectively the "worst" quality based on numbers alone, most people won't notice a difference, especially on phones or Bluetooth speakers. The biggest boons for Spotify users, in particular, are that service's ubiquity, community features and ability to easily pair with other devices.Apple's also gets high marks due to its suitability for iOS and Mac users, as well as the ability to listen to higher-quality streams at no extra cost. If the service was more yielding to PC users and smart home fans, Apple Music would easily become the service we would recommend. In short, Spotify is better for users of almost any phone, smart device or computer. We also tested
Napster: Popular music streaming service Rhapsody relaunched as Napster in 2016. It offers 110 million tracks including lossless for $11 a month. The service is fine, although it lacks the killer features of the best here -- e.g. podcasts, simplified streaming and community features. Competition is stiff, and Spotify and Apple are a better value. See at Napster.Pandora Premium: Still one of the most popular streaming radio services in the US, Pandora also offers the a la carte Premium ($11 a month) and no-ads Plus ($5 a month). The result is more flexibility than most competitors, and Premium has gained plenty more subscribers in recent years, even if the service is not keeping up in terms of overall catalog size. Sadly, its audio quality is among the lowest available, even on the Premium subscription (192Kbps), and it doesn't offer enough of an incentive for an upgrade from its highly popular free tier. See at Pandora. Music streaming FAQs
How do I listen to free music?
Most of the streaming music services offer free tiers -- including Spotify, Pandora, Amazon and YouTube -- but they do come with a couple of caveats. First, these are usually playlist services, in which you can pick a song and the rest of the tunes auto-generate -- you can't pick exactly what you want to play. The other potential downside is that they come with ads, and sometimes it's the same ad for every break.

How do you transfer your library between services?
Without contracts, it's pretty easy to cancel one service and start with another. Swapping between music services isn't as straightforward as swapping between movie locker services using Movies Anywhere, for example. If you don't want to have to rebuild your playlists and library from scratch when you switch, you have two main options: a music locker service such as YouTube Music (but this implies you have a library of ripped or bought MP3s), or a library import tool such as Soundiiz. The latter is a service that lets you import the songs from each of your music services and transfer them, and while there's a $4.50 monthly charge, you can always cancel once you've converted your library. Deezer offers the ability for new users to convert their libraries from other services for free (via another service called Tune My Music).

Do I need spatial or Atmos audio?
The short answer is "no" and the long answer is "sort of, maybe." Stereo music has been around since the 1950s and its worldwide catalog simply dwarfs the amount of Atmos audio tracks by comparison. Apple may rave about how "magical" spatial music is, but unless you have an expensive Dolby Atmos system, you may not be able to hear the differences anyway. In our own tests, we've found that a well-mixed Atmos track on a dedicated setup can be fun. It's like a roller coaster -- enjoyable, but you wouldn't want to use it as your sole form of transport. However spatial audio does make sense if you're watching a movie because you're not moving your head that much, and soundtracks are designed to be listened in surround, anyway. While the music industry has tried unsuccessfully to market surround music with Quadraphonic in the 1970s and DVD-Audio in the 2000s, it's unlikely stereo music will ever go out of favor.

Which music streaming service has the biggest catalog?
At the time of writing, all of the services offer at least 100 million tracks each -- while Deezer says it has 120 million -- but that's not the end of the story. The number of songs offered by a music service used to be the main differentiator, but as always, it's quality over quantity that counts -- and particularly if you're looking for more obscure tracks. Depending on your favorite genre, some of the services may offer a better catalog for under-the-radar (Spotify), indie (Apple) or hip-hop artists (Tidal). Users who are less ambitious about expanding their musical taste should be satisfied with the catalogs that all the services offer.

Which services include music lockers?
Amazon was one of the first services to offer uploading your MP3 collection into the cloud, but this was officially discontinued in 2018. Meanwhile, both the Apple and YouTube services allow you to combine your personal music collection with the streaming catalog, although tagging and organization can be a time-consuming challenge (your myriad live Phish tracks won't organize themselves). Still, if you've invested money in digital music over the years, those two services offer a patch to continue enjoying that music online.
