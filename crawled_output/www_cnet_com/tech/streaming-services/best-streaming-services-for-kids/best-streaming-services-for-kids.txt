What to consider
Cost
Some of these services are free to access, while others require a paid subscription. And if you don't mind your child seeing ads while streaming, you can choose a free platform or low-cost plan to save money each month. Not every streamer shows commercials on kids' content, but prepare to pay more for a service like Paramount Plus or Disney Plus to stream without ads.
Simultaneous streams
For any streaming service, you'll want to know how many screens you can watch at a time. For example, Netflix's ad-based plan allows two simultaneous streams, but you have to upgrade to the premium version if your family needs four screens. Look for platform offerings that let your household stream on multiple devices at once if that's what you need.
Parental controls
Streaming services that house mature content -- such as Max and Netflix -- provide ways for parents to restrict what programming kids can watch. Others offer children's-only content with customizable settings that allow you to block certain titles. Check for parental controls that aren't easily bypassed, like PINs or curated kids' profiles.

Add to compareFactors to consider
Selection of kid-friendly programming: Some streamers offer a wide variety of family-friendly titles for all ages, from preschool to teens. Others have limited catalogs or cater more to a younger demographic.Parental controls: Some services don't offer the ability to change age ratings or block certain content for kids. Be sure you can adjust parental controls, control access to mature content or curate each child's profile based on age.Simultaneous streams: Services may charge extra for additional streams. Ensure household coverage and consider account-sharing costs.Finding shows and movies: Is the interface user-friendly? It should be fairly easy to search for things to watch using menus and other features.  How we test kids streaming services
It's likely you've heard of most of the platforms on this list, but it's by no means comprehensive. There are plenty of other ways to stream and hundreds of other choices out there. As we evaluated these streaming options, we kept certain things in mind for kids.We first considered how much, what type and the quality of content available on each service for every age group. We tested parental control settings and kid profiles. In addition to catalog size and maturity settings, we looked at design (i.e.: ease of use across different TV and mobile platforms for kids), ads, features (like mobile downloads, recommendations, watch lists and number of streams) and value (price compared to these other factors). Click through to the full reviews for more details. Other streaming services we tested
Prime Video: This service is easily accessible for Prime members with a catalog that combines Freevee, Amazon originals and some licensed content, such as the uber-popular Peppa Pig. Though Prime Video has a decent selection of movies and TV shows, it gleans much of its kids' programming from Nickelodeon, PBS Kids and other Viacom properties.Hulu: Like Prime Video, Hulu offers originals (such as Animaniacs) and titles for every age. Much of it comes from other networks. Compared with its rivals, Hulu's price and content lineup is less appealing for a spot on this best list. But our perspective may change when Hulu and Disney Plus begin offering a single app option that will bring titles from both streaming services into one platform.
Kids streaming services FAQ
What about live TV streaming services?
If you prefer a streaming experience that's similar to linear TV, you may want to consider a live TV streaming service such as YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV or Sling. They cost more than on-demand services, and each offers a roster of family-friendly channels and a set of parental controls, but it depends on the service. You may find a suite of Disney Channel offerings, Cartoon Network, PBS, Animal Planet or other live channels that pique your kids' interest, but you may find it's cheaper to get Disney Plus or Max. Check out our channel guide for live streaming services to see which platforms have what you want.
Show more
What about Amazon Kids Plus?
Amazon Kids Plus is a great app that includes books, videos and games for children. However, its streaming TV lineup is small, with a few originals in addition to licensed titles from PBS, Hasbro and other companies. Kids will be happy to watch Strawberry Shortcake, Pokemon and Lego Marvel, but parents must pay $5 per month for the app. It's a convenient choice if you're already a Prime member or own a Fire tablet, and parents are able to share purchased Prime Video titles (like Spider Man: No Way Home) with their child's Amazon Kids account. Parental controls allow you to set time restrictions and receive notifications if your child requests to buy something.That said, when compared to other paid streaming services on this list, we felt they offer more variety than Amazon Kids Plus when it comes to TV shows and movies.
Show more
What if you don't want your kids watching ads while streaming?
We know that screen time is not the only area of concern, because advertising affects kids, too. Disney Plus has an ad-supported plan that includes commercials in its kid-friendly content. But Netflix's ad-based plan keeps ads out of children's titles. Both services -- in addition to Max, Kidoodle and Paramount Plus -- offer more expensive plans if you want to watch all content without commercials. The PBS Kids app is ad-free.
