What to consider
Do you prefer on-demand or live?
Some free streaming platforms offer both live and on-demand content or only one type. If you like to channel hop, then a service like Pluto may be your first pick over Tubi or Freevee. Because they're all free, you can get more than one without hurting your wallet.
Ad load
Only one service on this list is completely ad-free, so you should decide if the commercials are worth the tradeoff during your viewing experience. The ads are not that heavy in Tubi, but you may discover they are unbearable on another service. Choose according to your tolerance level.
Kids' content?
Not every free streaming service is loaded with kid-friendly titles, so scroll through the live and on-demand lineups to see who carries the most age-appropriate content. You can also check out our best streaming services list for kids for recommendations on free platforms.

Back to selection
When it comes to free TV streaming services, your wallet can catch a break. You can switch around between them as often as you’d like without parting with a penny. Despite the ads on most of these services, streaming TV for free offers plenty of benefits. You can watch live news broadcasts, on-demand shows and movies and stream content 24/7 on FAST channels. Whether you want reality TV, horror flicks, true crime or kids’ shows, services like Tubi and Pluto TV have older series and films, sort of like basic cable reruns. And some platforms offer their own original programming. Our Picks

Free streaming services FAQs
What's the best overall free TV streaming service?If we had to choose only one platform to wear the ultimate crown, it would be Tubi. The Fox-owned brand touts an easy-to-use interface and extensive library of TV shows, movies and live channels. Find cult classics alongside new Tubi originals, or take advantage of its features that help you personalize your recommendations, like its Rabbit AI tool or Scenes function.Still, other options listed here are considered among the best free streaming services; Pluto TV is great for channel surfers and the Roku Channel can be convenient if you want to watch the news without cable. Here's more on why we think Tubi is the best and other free streamers that enable you to indulge your inner couch potato.Read more: The Best Live TV Streaming Services for Cord CuttersBest free TV streaming services of 2025

Pros

Lower live channel count than some competitors
Only one profile per account
Tubi TV offers considerably more free movies than TV shows, but it continues to grow its extensive library and its live channel lineup. This ad-supported network doesn't require an account, although signing up for one enables you to save favorites and resume playback if you switch between devices.Tubi offers nationwide and local news livestreams in addition to live sports, weather and entertainment channels. The streaming site's TV selection offers some of the reality shows we've come to expect, such as Hell's Kitchen and Dance Moms, plus oddball inclusions such as the Australian drama McLeod's Daughters.To watch TV series on demand, you can browse by title, network or genre, including a Tubi Kids category. Not every show has full seasons available, but you'll find Broadchurch, Columbo and six seasons of Gossip Girl among the choices. There are also a handful of Tubi originals as well as feature films such as The Goonies and Snowpiercer.  ... Show more

Pros
250+ channels
Popular movies on-demand
Cons
No way to pause livestream
Smaller on-demand selection than some others
Pluto TV is noteworthy for offering not only on-demand, free movie streaming, but also more than 250 live and linear channels on the platform, including BBC Food, CSI, Star Trek and CBS News. Because it's a Paramount-owned brand, Pluto also has episodes of shows like Criminal Minds and Survivor.Pluto offers an impressive selection of live channels sorted into categories like news, reality, sports, comedy and movies in a grid format. On-demand TV content is organized into TV drama series, sitcoms, crime, game shows, sci-fi and more. The layout is not nearly as slick as the live channels, but there's a variety of genres. One oddity: If you're watching a livestream, there's no way to pause. You can only mute it.  ... Show more

Pros
400+ channels

Cons
Streaming is better outside of mobile app
Roku Channel is a free TV streaming service designed for people who own the company's streaming devices and TVs, but it's also available via Roku's apps for phones and tablets as well as online. The Roku Channel offers more than 400 live channels including a channel guide, with its existing selection of on-demand content. While the linear TV includes live news and lifestyle channels, the on-demand content ranges from Roku originals (like the Weird Al Yankovic biopic), to reality TV (Hoarders, Kitchen Nightmares) to popular series like 2 Broke Girls and House. You'll also find anime (live and on-demand) and crime shows. Unfortunately, not every TV series is complete (Bewitched, for example), and the service offers only a single episode in some cases. There's plenty of stuff to watch, including a dedicated kids section. There's also a solid array of classic movies, including It's a Wonderful Life and The Usual Suspects. In addition, you can subscribe to premium services including Paramount Plus, much like you can via Prime Video channels or the Apple TV app.  ... Show more

Best for library card holders
Hoopla Digital
Pros
No ads
Cons
Only available through certain libraries
Got a library card? Check to see if your library has partnered with Hoopla. This digital-media service allows you to check out all kinds of stuff -- from ebooks to movies to TV shows. When you "borrow" one, you have 72 hours in which to watch it. Your library determines the total number of titles you can borrow each month. A bonus for this service is no commercials are interrupting your viewing experience.Hoopla's TV selection is something of a hodgepodge, with a smattering of well-known shows mixed in with a lot of self-help, documentary and family fare. For example, you'll find two seasons of Chewing Gum, both seasons of The Jim Gaffigan Show and lots of Ken Burns documentaries. Hoopla also has instructional videos from The Great Courses series, various kids shows and plenty of Acorn TV content that would otherwise require a subscription. Film selections rotate on and off the platform, so be sure to check the rotation on a regular basis.  ... Show more

Add to compareFactors to consider
Use them all: As all these services are free, you have nothing to lose by trying multiple out and determining which suits you best. You could also take a different approach by searching for a movie or show you want to watch and see if any free services offer it.On-demand or flipping through channels: The free TV streaming services often feature both on-demand content and live channels, but not always. You may prefer Pluto for channel surfing and Sling Freestream for on-demand binging, or the opposite. Think about what you want to get out of a free TV service and what each one provides.Ads on ads on ads: With most of these TV services, ads are the price you pay to watch titles for free. If you really can't stand ads, you may need to stick with premium subscriptions from streamers like Netflix and Max.Kids offering: Consider whether the free service offers kid-friendly content, and that ads may be a factor. Hoopla, if you can get it through your library, is an ad-free option on this list. How we test streaming services
With more than 200 streaming services in existence -- globally -- it can be hard sifting through each brand and its offerings. We narrowed this list down based on several factors, including accessibility, popularity, on-demand content, live channels and reliability. We watched each service on a TV and mobile device to evaluate its user interface and channel roster.These apps can be easily accessed on virtually any media player, smart TV, web browser or mobile device, and they offer a variety of content to suit genre preferences or age ranges. Because they're free services, there's added value for those that offer originals and live channels. When doing test runs of these services, we didn't encounter problems with crashing, lag time or choppy live broadcasts, but your mileage may vary. Other streaming services we tested
Peacock: The main way to access Peacock is by being a paying customer. Plans include Premium, which is $8 a month or $80 a year, and Premium Plus, which is $14 a month or $140 a year. NBCUniversal's streaming service also has a free tier, which may or may not be good news for you. As of January 2023, you must already be a Peacock Premium subscriber to use the free version of Peacock. In addition to being exclusive to older users, the tier severely limits what you can watch compared to if you paid for Peacock, so we opted not to include it on this version of our best list. If you've had a Peacock account long enough, the free tier should be available if you aren't actively paying for a Peacock subscription.
Free streaming services FAQs
What about free apps for networks like ABC, NBC, PBS, CW and others?
These are also viable options. You can watch shows from your favorite networks on their dedicated apps but we opted to not include them on this list as some (like ABC) require you to be registered with a cable/TV provider to view the most recent content. Network apps typically allow you to watch new episodes of your shows the next day -- or week -- via their app or website. In some cases, you can also watch live news broadcasts or episode reruns of TV series.
Show more
Do I have to sit through ads on these services?
Yes. The tradeoff for receiving content to stream for free is that you have to tolerate commercials. Whether you're watching a live channel or on-demand video, each of these services will run ads during your viewing experience. To keep the content free, they have to pay the bills with ads. The only exception on this list is Hoopla.
Show more
Which app has the most family-friendly content?
If you're looking for age-appropriate shows and movies, you'll find plenty of titles on Tubi, Roku Channel and Freevee for young children, tweens and teens. Pluto also features dedicated kids' channels with content from Nickelodeon, Lego, Garfield and more.
