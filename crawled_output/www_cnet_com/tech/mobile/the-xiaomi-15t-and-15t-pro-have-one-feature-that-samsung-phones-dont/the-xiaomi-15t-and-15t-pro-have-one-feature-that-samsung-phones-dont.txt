The Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro Have One Feature That Samsung Phones Don't
The phones pack a lot for the money but US shoppers will have to look elsewhere.

The Xiaomi 15T Pro has a good camera setup on the back. Andrew Lanxon/CNET
Xiaomi's 15 Ultra impressed me earlier in the year with its stellar camera setup that provides superb quality for pro shooters. But the company's not done for the year just yet; the Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro pack Leica-branded camera systems and a host of high-end tech into a metal body. I've been hands-on, and there's a lot to like. Both the processor and the cameras put in solid performances during my hands-on time with them. Plus, I was intrigued to hear about a unique new feature found only on the Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro: a walkie talkie mode for making device-to-device voice calls in areas where there is no cell service. Read more: I Took Over 1,000 Photos With the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Check Out My FavoritesAt the time of writing, Xiaomi wouldn't confirm pricing details for the 15T or 15T Pro, but for reference, last year's 14T Pro started at £650 (roughly $880) in the UK and was a high-performing mid-range handset. I'd expect the 15T Pro to come with a similar price tag. It's safe to assume the base 15T will be at least £100 cheaper. As with all of Xiaomi's products, an official US launch is not on the cards. Xiaomi 15T Pro camerasThe back of the 15T Pro is home to a triple-camera array, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom and a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera.

Taken with the main camera, I like the warm tones and rich contrast here. Andrew Lanxon/CNET

The phone has kept a good handle on exposure with this image from the main camera. Andrew Lanxon/CNETOn a sunny late summer day in Edinburgh, I found the main camera capable of taking solid shots with even exposure, accurate colors and plenty of detail.
Enlarge Image
There's noticeably less detail in images taken with the ultrawide lens, especially toward their edges. Andrew Lanxon/CNETSwitching to the ultrawide lens, I'm not quite as impressed. The exposure balance isn't as good and the details are noticeably poorer, especially towards the edge of the frame. Still, it's fine for snaps.
Enlarge Image
At 5x zoom, images are crisp and clear. Andrew Lanxon/CNETBut the 5x optical zoom is impressive, delivering crisp details and consistent exposure handling, just like the main camera.

There are various color profiles to choose from on the phone. Andrew Lanxon/CNET

As with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, it's the Leica-branded black-and-white preset that I keep coming back to. It delivers a punchy look that I really love. Andrew Lanxon/CNET
Enlarge Image
The front-facing camera captured a vibrant image here, without too much unnatural skin smoothing. Andrew Lanxon/CNETLike the 15 Ultra, it also offers a Pro mode that allows you to shoot in RAW, manually adjust settings and choose from various color profiles -- including several of the same Leica-branded ones found on Leica's regular cameras.Xiaomi 15T Pro: Design and displayThe phone is made with an aluminum alloy frame and a glass fiber back, which feels sturdy in hand, while its IP68 waterproof rating means the occasional splash won't be a problem. I think the phone looks a bit plain; even its "mocha gold" color leans more towards 1970s couch brown. But looks are subjective and hardly matter if you're just going to throw a case on it anyway.
The metal and glass fiber construction feels sturdy to hold. Andrew Lanxon/CNETThe 6.8-inch display is bright enough for use in direct sunlight, with rich colors and plenty of screen real estate to do justice to mobile games or YouTube videos -- perfect for your commute. Xiaomi 15T Pro: Processor, battery and extrasThe 15T Pro runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ processor, which clocked some decent scores on the Geekbench 6 benchmark test. It came in a bit shy of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but a fair way above the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL. In everyday use, I found it nippy and it handled gaming in PUBG and Destiny: Rising without any issues.Powering the phone is a 5,500-mAh battery, which should get you through a full day of mixed use. It supports up to 90W wired charging, which should get juice back in the tank very quickly, assuming you have a compatible charger.
The 15T Pro's display is pretty easy to view under direct sunlight. Andrew Lanxon/CNETThe phone runs Android 15 at its core and I'm a bit peeved that it comes preinstalled with a bunch of third-party apps, including Amazon shopping, Amazon music, AliExpress, Facebook and more. It makes the phone feel cluttered right out of the box; I recommend uninstalling whatever you don't want before you even begin installing your own apps. An interesting new feature is offline communication, which lets two 15T series phones make direct device-to-device voice calls from up to 1.9 kilometers away. It essentially turns the phone into a walkie-talkie, offerings a way to communicate in areas where there's no cell service -- like when you're hiking with friends in the wilderness. It's a novel idea, and as far as I know, unique to Xiaomi. That said, it currently only works if both you and your friend have a Xiaomi 15T or 15T Pro, so hopefully the company rolls it out to more devices soon.
The Xiaomi 15T (left) and the 15T Pro (right). Andrew Lanxon/CNETXiaomi 15T and 15T Pro: Are they any good?The 15T Pro's solid processor and camera performance make it a decent all-round phone for what I'm hoping will be a reasonable mid-range price tag. While it won't be offering much competition to the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the new iPhone 17 Pro, it's got everything you'd need from an everyday Android phone.The base 15T packs most of the same camera setup but uses a slightly less powerful processor and misses out on the 90W fast charging found in its Pro sibling. I expect it to cost even less, making it a better option if you're shopping on a budget.
