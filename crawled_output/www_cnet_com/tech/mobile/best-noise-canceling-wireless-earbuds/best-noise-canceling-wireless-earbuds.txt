Today's wireless earbuds offer active noise cancellation, or ANC, that matches and even surpasses the noise canceling found in full-size over-ear headphones. While there are dozens of good noise-canceling earbuds available at a variety of prices, these are my current favorites based on my 15 years of experience testing earbuds. Not only do all these buds do a good job muffling ambient noise, but they also sound impressive, are well designed and deliver strong voice-calling performance. I've also included a few top budget noise-canceling earbuds options for folks who don't want to spend too much. Our Picks

Noise-canceling earbuds FAQs
What are the best noise-canceling earbuds overall? With a host of improvements, including a better fit, noise canceling and sound quality, Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 currently top our list and are easy to recommend to Apple users. Bose's recently released QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) also feature superb noise canceling and excellent sound quality. Some newer additions to the list include the Sony WF-CF710N, which frequently go on sale for less than $100 and the Anker Soundcore P41i, which have a charging case that doubles as a power bank and can charge your phone. The best noise canceling can mask a wider range of frequencies and do so on the fly ("adaptive" noise canceling) with sophisticated software algorithms, advanced microphones and powerful micro processors embedded in the buds. Apple, Bose and Sony remain among the leaders in this category, but the noise canceling for more affordable models continues to improve. Keep in mind that this list focuses on the best noise-canceling earbuds, not over-ear headphones. For a mix of both, check out our roundup of the best noise-canceling headphones with active noise cancellation.What we updated: September 2025I added the Apple AirPods Pro 3 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd gen) and removed the AirPods Pro 2, Nothing Ear and Beats Fit Pro, as rumors and leaks suggest that Nothing and Beats will soon update those models.

Best wireless earbuds overall
Apple AirPods Pro 3
Pros
Design upgrades to the buds and ear tips improve their fit
Noise cancellation has been upgraded and is now top-notch
They sound better with improved bass response and more clarity
Built-in heart-rate monitoring with new sensors
Excellent voice-calling performance (upgraded microphones)
Battery life rated for up to 8 hours (up from 6 for AirPods Pro 2)
Cons
They still use the H2 chip found in the AirPods Pro 2
Heart-rate monitoring is buried in fitness apps
While they work with Android, many of their features are exclusive to Apple devices
Some new colors would be nice
Why I like themWhile I didn't get a new H3 chip and I was hoping that the charging case would be able to convert into a Bluetooth transceiver to use the buds on a plane with an inflight entertainment system, I did get most of what I was looking for in the AirPods Pro 3. The changes may seem incremental to some folks, but all the key elements such as fit, sound quality and noise cancellation have been noticeably leveled up along with single-charge battery. They're about as close as earbuds get to being complete: excellent noise cancellation, strong voice-calling performance and sound quality that rivals the very best. Few buds excel in all three areas -- and the Pro 3s manage it while packing in plenty of extra features, including their new heart-rate monitoring feature. Read my full review.Reasons to buyAs I said, these buds are significantly improved in the four most important areas: fit, sound quality, noise cancellation and battery life. The result is that you don't feel like you're making any compromises when buying the AirPods Pro 3 if you're an Apple user.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile they work with Android devices, you lose many of the AriPods 3's extra features if you're not using them with Apple devices and its iPhones and iPad in particular. They also may just be a little too expensive for many folks.  ... Show more

Top Bose earbuds with superb noise canceling
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)
Pros
Excellent sound and improved noise-canceling that's truly impressive
Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit
New Immersive Audio Cinema mode for video content that also improves speech clarity for spoken-word content
Slightly improved voice-calling
Wireless charging has finally been added
Cons
Hardware changes don't really amount to a true 2.0 product
Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life
Why I like themAs far as the hardware goes, the QC Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) look exactly the same as the original QC Ultra Earbuds, although Bose has added a new plum color to the line. There are two small changes. The 2nd Gen Ultra Earbuds now support wireless charging, a feature that should have been available with the originals. The included ear tips now have wax guards, a fancy way of saying there's a silicone mesh that now covers the holes in the tips. The reality is, they don't seem like a true 2.0 product. But they do feature improved adaptive noise canceling that's truly impressive (it's neck-and-neck with the Apple AirPods Pro 3's noise canceling for the best ANC in a set of earbuds), along with some sound quality enhancements, including a new spatialized immersive audio Cinema mode that widens the soundstage and makes "video content more lifelike" with clearer dialog. The mode also helps with spoken-word audio content like podcasts and audiobooks.New features available in both the original QC Ultra Earbuds and Gen 2 model include:Bose SpeechClaritySpotify TapTurn capacitive controls on/offGeneral connectivity and stability improvementsFeature upgrades available exclusively to the Gen 2 model include:Enhanced adaptive noise cancellationReduced noise floor (the faint hiss in noise-canceling mode)Case battery reportingCinema Mode Reasons to buyThe Bose QuietComfort Ultra offer a comfortable, secure fit and feature superb noise canceling and excellent sound quality. While the improvements to this model are incremental, it's good that Bose has made some upgrades to an already great set of noise-canceling earbuds. They also work well with both iOS and Android smartphones. Reasons to skip/keep lookingThey're pretty pricey and a little bigger than some earbuds like the AirPods Pro 3 and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

Best Sony noise-canceling earbuds
Sony WF-1000XM5
9.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
New smaller design
Improved sound, noise canceling and voice calling
Upgraded processors and drivers
Cons
Pricey
No Find My feature integrated into app
Companion app crashed several times during use
Not ideal for Apple users
Why I like themWhen Sony set out to design its WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds, it was looking to address some gripes folks had with their predecessor, the WF-1000XM4 earbuds that came out in 2021. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling performance. Overall they're impressive -- easily among the top earbuds on the market. Equipped with 8.2mm speaker driver units and two new proprietary Sony chipsets (V2 Integrated and QN2e Noise-Canceling processors), the earbuds deliver rich sound with nice detail, clear mids and punchy, well-defined bass. Read my full WF-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyI try a lot of new earbuds but I keep coming back the the WF-1000XM5s because they're just all-around very good earbuds, with strong overall performance and a solid feature set, including LDAC audio codec support for Android users and Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature that automatically lowers the volume of your music and puts the earbuds into ambient sound mode so you can easily have a conversation without removing your buds. Also, now that the buds have been out for around two years, they're often on sale and you can also find well-priced refurbished units.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile these earbuds are more compact and should be a good fit for more people's ears, they still might not fit some ears. Not everybody will get a tight seal from the included foam ear tips, even though they're available in four size options. Also, note that next-gen Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds should be coming in 2026.  ... Show more

Best-sounding noise-canceling earbuds under $100
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC
Pros
Affordable
Impressive sound for the price
Comfortable, secure fit
Decent noise canceling
Good battery life
Cons
Charging case is bulky
Why I like themIn a surprise move, Skullcandy has joined forces with Bose to create what's essentially a budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. With "Sound by Bose," not only do the Method 360 ANC buds sound better than most earbuds in this price class (they sound very similar to Bose's $170 QuietComfort Earbuds), they also fit comfortably and securely thanks to Bose's Fit Kit system that features stability bands to lock the buds in your ears. While they share many of the traits of Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they're lighter and lack the more premium finish of those pricey buds. Also, their noise canceling isn't up to the QC Ultra's best-in-class ANC standard. But it's still effective and better than the noise canceling I experienced with previous Skullcandy earbuds I've tested. Read Skullcandy Method 360 ANC review.Reasons to buyWhile you can find earbuds that sound pretty decent for this price (or a little more), the Method 360 ANC's sound quality is a notch up from what you typically find at this price point. Another selling point is that these buds should fit most ears comfortably and securely thanks to the Bose-like design.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Method 360 ANC's only potential major drawback is its rather large carrying case and the buds themselves are a little bigger than most. Some people won't mind that the case is bulky, but it may be dealbreaker for some folks. Also, voice-calling performance could be better, but hopefully that will improve with firmware updates.  ...

Top value noise-canceling earbuds
Earfun Air Pro 4
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Relatively inexpensive
Very good sound and overall performance for their price
Decent noise canceling
Support for AAC, AptX and LDAC audio codecs
Cons
Touch controls and voice-calling performance could be slightly better
Why I like themEarfun is one of our go-to brands for budget earbuds and its Air Pro 4 buds (read my full review) are one of the better earbuds values out there, which is why I awarded them an CNET Editors' Choice in 2024. While they aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Apply the code EAP4CNET at checkout on Amazon to get an additional 10% off).Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs.Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much.Reasons to buyAs I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio).Reason to skip/keep lookingThe voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. And lastly, I should note that Earfun will release the slightly updated Air 4 Pro Plus this fall, though it'll likely be more expensive than this model at launch.  ... Show more

Best earbuds with power bank built into charging case
Anker Soundcore P41i
Pros
Charging case has a built-in 3,000 mAh battery and USB-C cable for charging smartphones and other devices
Buds are lightweight and comfortable to wear
Decent sound quality with strong bass performance
Case also has built-in standing to prop up your phone
Very good battery life
Cons
Case is a little bulky and heavy
No ear-detection sensors
Case does not charge wirelessly
Why I like themAnker's earlier Soundcore P40 buds have a stand built into their charging case for propping your phone up for video watching. The new-for-2025 P41i not includes an integrated stand but a 3,000-mAh battery and USB-C cable that turns the case into a power bank for charging your phone (owners of older iPhones can also get a version with an integrated Lightning cable that costs $10 more). While the case is a little heavy and bulkier than many earbuds cases, I like the two-devices-in-one concept. Note that while it doesn't offer high-speed charging, it does charge at 10W speeds, which isn't too shabby.As for the buds themselves, while they lack such extra features as ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear, they offer decent sound with strong bass performance and decent noise-canceling and voice-calling capabilities. The sound isn't as rich or detailed as what you get with more premium buds, but it's respectably smooth and steers clear of any harshness. Battery life is also good: A single charge gets you up to 10 hours of playback time at moderate volumes with ANC on. And if you don't use the case to charge your phone (it will charge an iPhone 16 to about 50%), it has enough juice to charge the buds around 15 times.Reasons to buy themYou like the idea of combining your earbuds with a power bank to charge your phone in a pinch.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you like your earbuds cases small, these probably aren't the buds for you. While the case isn't huge, it's heavier and larger than a lot cases because it does have a 3,000-mAh battery in it. Typically, earbuds charging cases are equipped with 300-mAh to 700-mAh batteries (the AirPods Pro 2's charging case has a 523-mAh battery by comparison).  ... Show more

Best noise-canceling wireless earbuds for Samsung users
Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable
Very good sound quality
Decent noise canceling
Excellent voice-calling performance
Lights in buds are kind of cool
Cons
A little pricey
Design looks a tad generic
Why I like themThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro stand out with their excellent fit, impressive sound quality and top-notch voice-calling performance. Though Samsung has added stems (it calls them "blades" and they have integrated LEDs) to these flagship earbuds, this new design works better for more people -- I found the buds lightweight and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is noticeably improved from the previous Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, with superior treble clarity and bass definition, producing a cleaner, more accurate sound. The ambient mode, which lets external sound into the buds, works very well, sounding natural with no audible hiss. And I liked that the buds have their own built-in voice-commands (they do not require a wake word like Google Assistant or Siri), an underrated feature. Read my Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review. Reasons to buySamsung had some kinks to work out with these buds at launch (they paused shipping them for a time), but they're excellent earbuds, with improved performance across the board. The stem design is a little controversial for fans of previous Galaxy buds, but I like their design and they're essentially Samsung's version of the AirPods Pro 2 but geared towards Android users and Galaxy device owners in particular who can take advantage of a few Samsung-only features like support for its "high-resolution" Samsung Seamless Codec (there's a Galaxy Wear app for Android users).Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile I've used them with my iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone users should probably look elsewhere, as there's no iOS app, meaning all updates and settings are only available via the Galaxy Wear app for Android. Those seeking the absolute best noise cancellation available might be disappointed, as the ANC, while good, is slightly behind what's offered by competitors. Finally, users with larger ear canals may not be able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips (only three sizes are provided). Since the ear tips are custom-designed for these buds, finding compatible third-party options can be challenging.  ... Show more

Best new earbuds from Anker
Anker Soundcore Liberty 5
Pros
Comfortable fit and attractive design
Improved noise canceling
Upgraded voice-calling performance with better noise reduction
Good battery life (up to 8 hours with ANC on)
Sliding cover is convenient
Cons
Would ideally be priced closer to $100
A touch of sibilance in the treble
Why I like themAfter Anker confused consumers a bit with multiple versions of its Liberty 4 earbuds at a few different prices, we get the new-for-2025 Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. Their sound quality is about the same or a tad better than that of the lower-priced Liberty 4 NC -- it's quite good but not great -- but the adaptive noise canceling and voice-calling performance have noticeably improved, with better noise reduction during calls. The AirPods-like buds fit my ears well and have good all-around performance at a more affordable price than the AirPods Pro 2. While some people may not love the new pinch controls (there's a physical button in the stem), I liked them, and the compact case has a sliding lid that doesn't pop open when you drop the case.Anker says the buds have 2x stronger voice reduction, which means the buds do a better job muffling people's voices around you (that was the case in my tests). As I said, the sound is good but not great (Anker says the buds have "wool paper diaphragms" and "bass-enhancing tubes"). Out of the box, you get a smiley face sound profile with strong bass, slightly accentuated treble and slightly recessed mids (there's a bit of sibilance in the treble). You can play around with the equalizer settings to improve the sound a bit and optimize it to your preference. Android users should note that buds support Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec for Bluetooth streaming, while the AAC codec is available for both iOS and Android users.The Liberty 5 are IP55 splash-proof -- they can withstand a sustained spray of water -- and dust resistant. Battery life is good -- the buds are rated for up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on and 10 hours with noise canceling off. Though the buds list for $130, we could see them discounted to closer to $100 later in 2025 so long as tariffs don't jump too high.Reasons to buyThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 are solid all-around wireless earbuds that offer good sound quality and improved noise-canceling and voice-calling performance for a fairly affordable price. Reasons to skip/keep lookingThey're a reasonable value at their list price, but I'd ideally like to see them priced closer to $100.

Best noise-canceling earbuds for Pixel smartphone and Android users
Google Pixel Buds Pro 2
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Smaller design
Improved sound and noise-canceling
New, more powerful Tensor A1 chip
Excellent battery life
Good voice-calling performance
Hands-free Google Assistant for Android users
Spatial audio
Cons
Ear tips may not allow some people to get a tight seal
No support for AptX or LDAC audio codecs for Android users
A few features not available for Apple users
Why I like themWhen they're in your ears, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 look a lot like the original Pixel Buds Pro and retain the stabilizer fins that help lock the buds in your ears. But they're smaller than their predecessor and Google equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and boosts their performance across the board. How you ultimately feel about them will largely depend on how well they fit your ears. That's the case for most noise-canceling earbuds, but with the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you don't get a tight seal from the included ear tips, there's a massive dip in both sound quality and noise-canceling performance. If you do get a tight seal, these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. Read my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.Reasons to buyFor Pixel device owners, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have some extra appeal because they're designed to work more seamlessly with your Pixel devices (there's automatic switching between Pixel smartphones, tablets and watches) and also feature "Clear Calling" for Pixel smartphones, which does improve voice calling performance a bit. That said, Android owners can take advantage of most of the Pixel Buds Pro 2's features, including hands-free Google Assistant and "Conversation Detect" feature that pauses what you're listening to and puts the buds in transparency mode when you start talking to someone.Reasons to skip/keep lookingI'll start by pointing out that while buds work just fine with iPhones, iPhone users miss out out several features, so Apple users should probably look elsewhere. From an ergonomic standpoint, the buds' smaller design should provide a better fit for a wider range of ears, but some people may find that the original Pixel Buds Pro fit their ears better. Also, some Android owners may be disappointed that the buds support neither Qualcomm's AptX or Sony's LDAC audio codecs (AAC and SBC are supported). Lastly, it's a little annoying that the white case can pick up stains from objects in pockets, though the case is easy enough to clean off with a alcohol wipe.  ... Show more

Best new wireless sports earbuds with ear hooks
Beats Powerbeats Pro 2
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Improved design and sound quality with smaller case
Equipped with more powerful H2 chip
Good noise canceling
Excellent voice-calling performance
Heart-rate sensors
Strong battery life
Wireless charging
Cons
Some users may not get a tight seal
A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2
More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)
Why I like themThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.These new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.Reasons to buyFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).  ...

Top-sounding earbuds from Panasonic
Technics EAH-AZ100
Pros
Excellent sound
10% smaller and 16% lighter than the AZ80s (better fit)
Improved noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking
Good battery life
Triple multipoint Bluetooth pairing
Cons
Despite smaller size, buds still stick out of your ears more than some buds
Why I like themPanasonic's new flagship earbuds, the Technics EAH-AZ100, feature a more compact design than the earlier EAH-AZ80 buds (the AZ100s are 10% smaller and 16% lighter) along with improved sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. One of the key upgrade here is Panasonic's newly developed proprietary Magnetic Fluid Driver that Panasonic says creates "clean, high-resolution, low-vibration and low-distortion sounds for the most authentic, balanced audio that's true to the original source." This type of driver is found in Technics high-end EAH-TZ700 wired in-ear monitors ($1,200), and it's been miniaturized for use in the AZ100s.I thought the AZ80s sounded really good, and these new AZ100s sound even better, with clean, accurate sound that brings out details in your music you don't hear with lesser earbuds (Android users get support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). As for extra features, there's Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking, plus you can pair with up to 3 devices simultaneously (most multipoint Bluetooth-enabled earbuds allow you to pair to two devices).Reasons to buyThe Technics EAH-AZ100 are among the best-sounding earbuds, so if sound quality is a priority, they should be on your short list. Also, the fact that their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved slightly is icing on the cake,Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 don't sound as good as these earbuds, they do offer superior noise canceling and voice-calling performance for less money along with an even more robust feature set, particularly for iPhone users.  ...

Best JBL noise-canceling earbuds with LCD in case
JBL Live Beam 3
7.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Comfortable design
Strong solid quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Touch-screen LCD integrated in case
Good battery life
Wireless charging
Cons
Noise canceling is good but not top notch
Why I like themThe Live Beam 3 earbuds look similar to the earlier Live Buds Pro 2, which I liked a lot, especially when they go on sale for less than $100. Essentially JBL's AirPods Pro 2 competitor, their distinguishing feature is the 1.45-inch touchscreen LCD integrated into their charging case that acts as a remote control for the buds and allows you to access their features. Equipped with 10mm drivers, not only do they offer clear, well-defined sound with punchy bass but their noise canceling and voice-calling performance are very solid. Their battery is also good -- they offer up to 10 hours of battery life with ANC on and 12 hours with it off at moderate volume levels (a 10-minute charge gives you four hours of battery life). Available in four color options, they're IP55 splash-proof and dust-resistant.Note that JBL's flagship Tour Pro 3 earbuds also have an integrated LCD but feature dual drivers, which deliver even better sound than these buds with a little more depth and detail. However, the Live Beam 3 often sell for $50 off their $200 list price, which makes them a better deal overall.Reasons to buyThe Live Beam 3 are really solid performing, well-designed earbuds that should most ears comfortably. Some may see the the touchscreen LCD as a bit of a gimmick, but it is useful as a remote control for the buds and a differentiating feature.Reasons to skip/keep lookingMy only minor gripes would be that the buds look a tad cheap for their somewhat elevated lists price. Also, the charging case is a bit larger and heavier than most charging cases becauseit has that built-in touchscreen LCD.  ... Show more

Best Sony noise-canceling earbuds with a secure fit
Sony LinkBuds Fit
Pros
Lightweight
Comfortable, secure fit
Very good sound and noise canceling
Strong voice-calling performance
Built-in voice controls
Cons
Case is slightly big
No wireless charging
Why I like themTruth be told, in some ways, I like the Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than its flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls.Reasons to buyIn many ways, these are Sony's answer to Beats' Fit Pro earbuds that were released in late 2021 and become very popular. Not only only do they sound good but they're lightweight and comfortable and fit securely in your ears thanks to their sport fins, making them good for both everyday use and sporting activities.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe biggest problem with the LinkBuds Fit is that their list price is too high (they're overpriced at full price). They do get discounted now, and they're more enticing when they dip below $150 (they'd ideally cost closer to $130).  ... Show more

Best value Sony noise canceling earbuds
Sony WF-C710N
Pros
Improved noise-canceling and battery life
Refreshed design
Good sound
New ear-detection sensors and upgraded voice-calling performance
Touch controls work well
Cons
Sound could be a tad more detailed and smooth
Why I like themNot surprisingly, the next-generation of Sony's entry-noise canceling earbuds now feature better noise canceling (with dual microphones). They also get a few other enhancements, including ear-detection sensors and upgraded voice-calling performance along with slightly better battery life and a style makeover, as these buds now come in an eye-catching translucent "glass" blue color that I liked a lot.The successor to the WF-C700N, the WF-C710N is a definite upgrade that delivers pleasing, dynamic sound with deep, punchy bass. Initially, I thought the earbuds were lacking a bit in the clarity department but when I prioritized sound quality in the settings and engaged Sony's DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) in Sony's companion SoundConnect app, the sound improved. That said, you're just not going to get the more refined and accurate sound of Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 earbuds, which sound smoother and more articulate (with some tracks I encountered a touch of distortion with the WF-C710N). The sound isn't quite as good as that offered by the more expensive LinkBuds Fit, which I like a little better because those buds are smaller and include sport fins. However, that model's battery life is only 5.5 hours and they do cost about $50 more.Battery life is rated for up to 8.5 hours on single charge with noise canceling on and audio played at moderate volume levels, though that number will dip if you engage DSEE. With the improvements, the CF-C710N are overall quite appealing earbuds that I enthusiastically recommend when they go on sale for $90.Reasons to buyYou want very good sounding Sony earbuds but can't afford the company's flagship buds.Reasons to skip/keep lookingSony's ear tips fit some people's ears better than others. If you don't get a good seal with the included ear tips, you may be disappointed in the sound quality and noise-canceling performance.

More affordable Bose noise-canceling earbuds
Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024)
Pros
Comfortable, secure fit
Very good sound and noise canceling
Good battery life
Case has wireless charging
Voice-control features built into buds
Cons
Buds and case are a little big
Voice-calling performance could be slightly better
Voice-control features are a bit hit or miss
Why I like themIn recent years, when it came to its new earbuds, Bose has focused on premium noise-canceling buds with premium price tags. But now it's released more affordable QuietComfort Earbuds ($179) for folks priced out of its $299 flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. The new QC Earbuds, as Bose calls them, don't perform quite as well as the QC Ultra Earbuds, but they offer a very secure, comfortable fit, strong sound and noice-canceling performance while adding a few new features, including built-in voice controls, not found in the Ultras. Read my Bose QuietComfort Earbuds (2024) review.Reasons to buyI came away impressed with the QC Earbuds, despite a couple of small shortcomings. Overall, they're very good buds and certainly worth considering, especially when they're discounted to $150 or less, which they frequently are.Reasons to skipI do think the buds and case are a little big compared to what you get with other buds. And while the voice-calling performance had its plusses (good background noise reduction), callers said my voice sounded a little muffled and sometimes warbled in noisy environments.   ... Show more

The Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 in midnight blue. David Carnoy/CNET
Best-sounding noise-canceling wireless earbuds
Bowers & Wilkins Pi8
Pros
Great sound
Smaller design with improved fit
Improved noise canceling
Smaller case transforms into a Bluetooth transceiver (it also has wireless charging)
Cons
Expensive
Some other premium earbuds have superior ANC and voice-calling performance
Why I like themSimply put, the Pi8s are fantastic-sounding earbuds that also benefit from having a clearly improved design from the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2. It's debatable whether the Pi8s sound $150 better than the step-down Pi6s, but there's no doubt these are some of the best-sounding earbuds on the market, if not the best (everybody's sound tastes vary so it's hard to declare one set of buds the best-sounding overall). Like with the Pi7 S2, sound quality is the highlight here, along with the charging case's ability to transform into a Bluetooth transceiver. Noise cancellation seems improved, and noise reduction during calls seems better, but the voice-calling performance wasn't as good as what I got with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.Reasons to buyThe Pi8 are easily among the top earbuds for sound quality with refined, spacious sound and deep, well-defined bass. Also, their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved from their predecessor, making them better earbuds all around. And lastly, that their case turn into a Bluetooth transceiver is a nice feature for frequent travelers who want to use their wireless earbuds with an inflight entertainment system.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Pi8 are pricey earbuds that will be out of a lot people's price range. And while models like the AiPods Pro 2 may not feature as impressive sound quality, they do offer slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance (and some other extra features) and cost less.  ...

Noise-canceling isn't as good as AirPods Pro 2's
Why I like themThe AirPods 4 are, unsurprisingly, the fourth generation of Apple's original true-wireless earbuds that feature an open design, which means they don't have silicone ear tips like the AirPods Pro 2. Not only do they feature a slightly smaller design and better sound than their predecessor, but they're equipped with Apple's H2 chip that improves overall performance and powers Apple's ever expanding AirPods features, though they don't have the AirPods Pro 2's Hearing Aid mode. Read my Apple AirPods 4 review.The AirPods 4 comes in two versions: a $129 entry-level model and a $179 step-up model with active noise canceling. ANC is a rare feature for open earbuds because it typically doesn't work with an open design, but these are the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works (it's about half as strong as the AirPods Pro 2's noise canceling). That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it.Reasons to buyA lot of people don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears and find open earbuds more comfortable (plus, you can hear the the outside world for safety reasons), and the AirPods 4 are made for those Apple users. They also sound very good for open earbuds and feature excellent voice-calling performance along with Apple's spatial audio and likable pinch controls. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Canceling are more special simply because noise canceling . While the AirPods 4 with ANC noise muffling capabilities aren't that great compared with what you get with the AirPods Pro 2 and top noise-canceling earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds or the Sony WF-1000XM5. But that it works at all and is reasonably effective is kind of wild because, as I said, noise canceling and open earbuds usually aren't a good mix.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile their slightly smaller, updated design fits a wider range of ears more securely, some folks may not get a secure fit. The AirPods Pro 2 offer a more flexible fit because they include four different sizes of ear tips. They also deliver better sound with more bass and significantly better noise canceling in a noise-isolating design.  ... Show more

Best-sounding Sennheiser noise-canceling earbuds
Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent sound
Upgraded Qualcomm chipset
Slightly improved battery life and noise canceling
Small upgrades to feature set
Added dust resistance
Cons
No external design changes
Pricey
Why I like themWhenever a new pair of Momentum True Wireless earbuds drops, I always find myself saying, "Wow, these sound good." Sound quality has always been the MTW's biggest strength, and that remains the case with the fourth-gen version. There's been some modest improvements in other areas, particularly with the noise cancellation performance and the reliable, hiccup-free Bluetooth connection I had with my phone. At the same time, the voice-calling performance could be better, and I'm a little disappointed that these aren't even more of an upgrade over their predecessor. Still, the Momentum True Wireless 4 are excellent earbuds that I have no problem recommending, particularly when they're discounted.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy these is for their audiophile-grade natural, accurate sound. And while the buds are a tad large, I their design (they fit my ears well) and the case is nice, too. But look for them at a discount because they've been out since February 2024.Reasons to skip/keep lookingSome competing models like the AirPods Pro 2 are more compact and have a much more robust feature set and better noise canceling and voice-calling performance. Also, if you prefer earbuds with bigger bass, these may not be for you.  ... Show more

Best value Beats noise-canceling earbuds
Beats Studio Buds Plus
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and discrete design fits most ears comfortably and securely
Upgraded performance from original Studio Buds, including better noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Android friendly (iOS users get hands-free Siri)
Improved battery life
Cons
No wireless charging capabilities
Missing several extra features that you get with the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, including spatial audio
No ear-detection sensors
Why I like themCompared to the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market, the newer Studio Buds Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. Read my Beats Buds Plus review.The transparent version got a lot of attention at launch (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' "acoustic architecture" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds.Reasons to buyThe compact Beats Studio Buds Plus offer good sound quality and strong all-around performance for an affordable price, especially when they're discounted, which they often are. It's also worth noting that like with other Beats headphones and earbuds, these are more Android-friendly than Apple's AirPods (there's a Beats app for Android) and the only feature that Apple users get that Android users don't is hands-free Siri.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Studio Buds Plus were released in May of 2023, so they're over two years old and may be due for an upgrade. Also, while the AirPods Pro 2 may cost more, they have a more robust feature set -- for Apple users anyway.  ... Show more

Excellent-sounding noise-canceling earbuds from Beyerdynamic
Beyerdynamic Amiron 300
Pros
Comfortable, lightweight design
Very clean, crisp sound
Good voice-calling performance
Wireless charging
Cons
Fairly pricey
Noise-canceling is decent but not great
Why I like themI thought Beyerdynamic's first pair of true-wireless earbuds, the Free Byrd, sounded impressive. But they were a little bulky and their design left something to be desired. That isn't the case for its Amiron 300 buds. They're compact, lightweight and fit my ears well -- I was able to get a tight seal with the largest ear tip. While their noise canceling falls short of what you get with flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Sony, Bose and Apple -- it's decent enough but not great -- the Amiron 300's sound is rich, detailed and fairly open (you can can distinctly hear each instrument). Out of the box, they have a very pleasant tonal balance, and you can tweak their EQ settings in Beyerdynamic's companion app. The bass is articulate and punchy and there's nice clarity and accuracy to the midrange (where voices live).The buds support the SBC, AAC and LDAC audio codecs and have some of the key features you'd expect from premium earbuds. These include ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear and resume playback when you put it back in, wireless charging, transparency and low-latency modes and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3). I thought their touch controls worked well and battery life was solid -- they're rated for up to 7 hours with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels and up to 10 hours with it off. They have 3 microphones in each bud and callers said they could hear me well even in noisy environments with only a bit of background noise intruding.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy the Amiron 300 is for their sound quality (they're among the best-sounding earbuds) and are also well-designed.Reasons to skip/keep lookingAt this price point, the competition is fierce, with a lots of good premium options. I can't declare that the Amiron 300 truly stands above flagship models from Sony, Panasonic (the Technics EAH-AZ100) and others.  ... Show more

Add to compareFactors to consider when choosing noise-canceling earbuds
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new noise-canceling earbuds. Value-priced noise-canceling earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good "cheap" buds for not too much money (as little as $60 for the Earfun Air Pro 4). If you're looking for premium buds from Sony, Apple, Bose or other luxury brands, be prepared to spend a lot more -- upwards of $300, in many cases. Fit It's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise cancellation can be dramatically affected for the worse. PerformanceYou want noise-canceling earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important with wireless earbuds, which are more susceptible to loss or damage due to their size. Most wireless earbuds have an IP rating, or a designation of how dust- or waterproof a product is. Those with higher IP ratings are more likely to withstand the elements should you need your earbuds outside of normal use. Return policyBecause the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy. That means you can return the buds if they aren't a good match for your ears. How we test noise-canceling earbuds
We test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria, comparing similarly
styled and priced models. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value. Design: Evaluating design, we assess not only how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. When it comes to earbuds, we also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings. Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.Noise-canceling performance: We evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they muffle not only street noise but people's voices. Extra features: Some great-sounding workout headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user-friendly it is. Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices.Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.  Other noise-canceling wireless earbuds we've tested
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: Bose has shipped its improved QC Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen), which means you'll be able to find discounts on the original QC Ultra Earbuds. They excellent sound and previously best-in-class noise-canceling performance.Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC: Released in 2023 and now discounted, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than 2022's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better. They have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. Status Between 3ANC: Status Audio's earbuds aren't exactly the sleekest or most attractive earbuds you can buy, but if you don't mind their utilitarian look and giant stems, you are getting an excellent-sounding set of earbuds. The Between 3ANC, the company's first noise-canceling earbuds, also do a good job muffling ambient sound, although they aren't up to the level of the Bose QuietComfort 2 earbuds for noise-canceling prowess. They did perform very well in my voice-calling test, reducing much of the background noise around me in the streets of New York while picking up my voice clearly, or so callers told me.Bowers & Wilkins PI7 S2: In 2023, Bowers & Wilkins upgraded its fantastic-sounding PI7 noise-canceling earbuds. The new S2 model has better battery life and Bluetooth range, now up to 25 meters (double the previous range). Additionally, the buds now integrate into the new Bowers & Wilkins Music app for iOS and Android and have a much-improved setup experience. Learn more in our full Bowers & Wilkins PI7 review. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. Master & Dynamic MW09: Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds ($349) look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to noise canceling. The earbuds sound great but are mysteriously out of stock everywhere, so we dropped them from the best list. If they come back in stock, we'll add them back to this list.Sony LinkBuds S: Unlike the "open" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating earbuds with tips that jam in your ears. They're more compact and lighter than Sony's former flagship WF-1000XM4 and also feature Sony's V1 processor (Sony has since released the more compact WF-1000XM5). Their sound and noise canceling don't quite measure up to either XM4s or XM5s, but they're still quite good. They're the Sony buds for people who can't afford Sony's flagship earbuds but want 80% of those buds' features and performance for significantly less. I've fully reviewed the Sony LinkBuds S and rated them an appreciative 8.4 out of 10. Sony WF-1000XM4: Released in 2021, Sony's WF-1000XM4 earned a CNET Editors' Choice Award. They're still excellent earbuds, but Sony has now released the next-gen WF-1000XM5. They may be a good option if you find them at a good discount. I published a full review of the Sony WF-100XM4 buds when they released if you think the budget earbuds are for you. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 were among the best new true-wireless earbuds of 2022. They're still among the best truly wireless earbuds, but Sennheiser has released the upgraded Momentum True Wireless 4. Also, the newer AirPods Pro 2 and Sony WF-1000XM5 buds are arguably superior, so only look to buy the Momentum True Wireless 3 when they're significantly discounted. Learn more about the buds in my Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review. JBL Tour Pro 2: JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds have received a lot of attention for bringing something new to true-wireless earbuds: a full-color touchscreen display embedded in the case that allows you to access the earbuds' key features and control playback as well as adjust volume levels. It's a bit of a gimmick but also useful. The buds could sound slightly better for their list price, but overall the JBL Tour Pro 2s are very good earbuds that offer a good fit, a robust feature set, strong battery life, plus solid noise canceling and voice-calling performance. I took a look at the feature-packed earbuds in 2023 and wrote a full JBL Tour Pro 2 review that you can read here. Beyerdynamic Free Byrd: Beyerdynamic may be late to the game, but it's finally introduced its first truly wireless earbuds, which feature active noise canceling, up to 11 hours of battery life (with noise canceling off) and impressive sound quality. Read my full Beyerdynamic Free Byrd Earbuds review to learn more. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2: Available in four colors, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 noise-canceling headphones don't feature as good sound or noise canceling as the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, but they're compact (15% smaller and 20% lighter than the earlier Buds Plus, they barely stick out of your ears) and cost significantly less. Because they sit more flush with your ears -- and have that curved design -- they also pick up less wind noise. They're IPX2 sweat-resistant while the step-up Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are fully waterproof (IPX7). My full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review from 2021 has more information on the earbuds. Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX: Bang & Olufsen's $399 Beoplay EX buds are the company's best true-wireless earbuds. They feature a comfortable, secure fit (except perhaps for those with really smaller ears), top-notch build quality, great sound, good noise canceling and improved voice-calling performance over B&O's EQ buds, with three microphones in each earbud they help with reducing background noise while picking up your voice. They're out of most people's price range, they're arguably the best earbuds out there with stems and offer slightly superior sound to the AirPods Pro 2 with better clarity, deeper more powerful bass and richer, more accurate sound. I reviewed the B&O Beoplay EX earbuds before they were released in 2022 and included some more information there. Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4: Their sound isn't quite up to the level of higher-end buds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 that cost significantly more, but the Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 earbuds have a strong set of features, including a spatial audio mode with head tracking, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, up to nine hours of battery life, wireless charging and support for Sony's LDAC audio codec that can offer sound improvements if you have the right setup. Read more in my Anker Liberty 4 review for more information on the mid-range earbuds. Sennheiser CX Plus: The Momentum True Wireless 3 are Sennheiser's flagship true-wireless earbuds. If you can't afford them, the Sennheiser CX Plus (which features very good sound and decent noise canceling) is a good alternative for a lot less money. The step-down CX, which has no active noise canceling, costs even less. Find out more about the budget earbuds in my full Sennheiser CX Plus review.
Noise-canceling earbuds FAQs
Does noise canceling drain the earbuds' battery?
When noise canceling is engaged, it does tend to have an impact on battery life. This is more of a factor with earbuds, which tend to offer anywhere from five to eight hours of battery life with noise canceling on and seven to 12 hours with it off. Full-size headphones can offer 25 to 30 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and up to 40 to 50 hours with it off.
Show more
Does noise canceling impact sound quality?
Active noise canceling can have a small adverse effect on sound quality, especially if the noise canceling isn't all that good (noise canceling can create a faint background hiss). It can mess with the purity of the sound quality so it's tricky to create a noise-canceling headphone that sounds really good. As a result, often high-end noise-canceling headphones that tout fantastic sound quality don't have as powerful noise canceling (the noise canceling feels lighter).
Show more
Does noise canceling block all noise?
Noise-canceling headphones and earbuds have traditionally been good at blocking out lower-frequency sounds such as the rumbling you hear while traveling on a plane. They haven't been so good at muffling higher frequencies (a baby screaming, for example) and even people talking around you. Companies like Bose, Sony and Apple have improved the technology in the last year or two so their noise canceling works across a wider range of frequencies. It still can't muffle all noise but top noise canceling is now doing a better job tamping down more noises that live in midrange and higher frequencies.
Show more
Is it 'noise-canceling' or 'noise-cancelling'?
Short answer: both. Either spelling is correct; it's a matter of preference. Also, "canceling" is more common in American English while "cancelling" is more common in British English. Bose goes with "noise cancelling." CNET, however, saves an entire character by going with "noise canceling." Regardless, the noise is canceled just the same.
Show more
Can noise canceling cause pressure in your ears?
Some people are very sensitive to noise canceling and end up feeling some pressure in their ears. As a result, some people can't use noise-canceling headphones or earbuds. Earbuds and headphones manufacturers have done a better job venting earbuds in recent years, relieving that pressure sensation.
