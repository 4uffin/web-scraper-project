Apple's Sleeper Hit of Its Fall Lineup? The Apple Watch SE 3

The Apple Watch SE 3 at Apple's September event. Celso Bulgatti/CNET
At Apple's September event, the new iPhone 17 models and AirPods Pro 3 took much of the attention, plus the super-thin iPhone Air and updated Apple Watch Ultra 3. But in this frugal girl's book, the real headliner was the one that snuck in as the real underdog of Apple's entire fall lineup: the Apple Watch SE 3.I usually overlook Apple's SE model because it lacks many of the powerhouse features of the flagship and Ultra editions, like an always-on display or temperature tracking. But this year, the underdog Apple Watch SE 3 is closing the gap, and at $249 for the base model, it may be the best value of the bunch. For the first time, I'm considering recommending it as the watch for most people (at least on paper).The second-generation SE hadn't been refreshed since 2022, so this update was long overdue, and it didn't disappoint. Apple's not gatekeeping this year, because the SE 3 now has many of the features that were once reserved for the more expensive Series and Ultra models, like a powerful S10 chip (the same one found on the Series 11 and Ultra 3), new 5G connectivity and an always-on display. It's also adding temperature tracking, sleep apnea alerts, sleep score, one-handed gesture control and fast charging. You'll even be able to play music through the speaker now, just like on the higher-end watches.The addition of an always-on display feels like a turning point. To me, that was always the biggest drawback of the SE. Not only is it helpful for workouts, but you can also disable it to extend battery life when necessary.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
Watch this: New Apple Watches Are Raising Our Blood Pressure With Their New Features
05:22
FOMO timeThere are still some drawbacks to picking the more affordable SE 3, but not as many. It's missing some of the advanced health features that rely on upgraded sensors, like the new hypertension notifications and ECG.Battery life hasn't changed either; Apple still claims 18 hours for the SE 3. Compare that with the Series 11 and Ultra 3, which Apple says will get 24 and 42 hours, respectively. But charging time has made a giant leap forward from the previous model. The SE 3 now supports the ultra-fast charging that debuted on the Series 10, so you can top it up quickly and get up to 8 hours of juice in just 15 minutes on the charger.
The Apple Watch SE 3 (right) with the Apple Watch Series 11 (middle) and Apple Watch Ultra 3 (left). Celso Bulgatti/CNETThe biggest aesthetic difference is size: the SE 3 comes in 40mm and 44mm options compared to the 42mm and 44mm options for the Series 11 and the 49mm for the Ultra 3. The SE has slightly wider bezels, which makes the actual screen look smaller. It's also missing some niche features like the depth gauge and water temperature sensor.I'm one to root for the underdog, and this year feels like the SE's turn to shine. Whether you're a first-time Apple Watch owner, buying it for a child or family member or upgrading from a Series 5 or older, the SE 3 offers standout value.It's available for preorder now and will be available in stores on Sept. 19. The 40mm Wi-Fi model costs $249, while the cellular model costs $299.
