The iPhone 17 Pro has been officially unveiled as part of Apple's "awe dropping" September event, alongside the base iPhone 17 and the super-skinny new iPhone Air. While the new Cosmic Orange color is definitely the eye-catching update to the Pro line, Apple's new flagships have upgrades across the board, including a new supercharged A19 Pro processor and a longer 8x zoom camera. The iPhone 17 Pro will go on sale with 256 GB of storage and a starting price of $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,999), while the larger iPhone 17 Pro Max will start at $1,199. Preorders for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are open now.The iPhone 17 Pro has had a slight price hike from the iPhone 16 Pro's $999 starting price last year. It now has double the storage and actually costs the same as the equivalent 256GB iPhone 16 Pro, putting to bed fears of significant price hikes due to Trump's tariffs for the time being.
Watch this: iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: All the New Features You Need to Know
04:31
iPhone 17 Pro: Design and displayThe biggest physical change is on the rear of the phone. The camera unit now stretches across the whole top of the phone rather than simply occupying a small square in the corner. The cameras themselves are still clustered in the same location as before, although Apple says the expanded space gives more room for batteries and for the updated telephoto zoom camera, which I'll come to later.
The orange is the stand out color here. Apple/Screenshot by CNETThe Pro models are now built from aluminum, instead of the titanium frames that debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro. It's a unibody construction, which should make it especially durable -- as should the new "Ceramic Shield" toughened glass on the front and back, which Apple says is 3x more scratch resistant. From the front, the phones remain almost indistinguishable from previous models, with only the Dynamic Island breaking the display in the small cutout towards the top. Apple has yet to confirm the water resistance rating of the phones, but it's pretty safe to assume they'll continue to be IP68-rated as has been the case with pretty much all iPhones since 2018.The new range does bring some new colors; however, the vibrant-looking orange model is my personal favorite. I've found the Pro iPhone range often takes itself a bit too seriously, relying on darker or more muted tones. That new life-affirming orange color looks right up my street. iPhone 17 Pro: CamerasThe Pro's cameras have had a series of significant upgrades. The optical zoom now goes to 8x, doubling the range of the zoom on the last model. It offers an equivalent focal length of 200mm, which will be great for photographers wanting to really get in on the action from a distance. The telephoto camera's sensor is 56% larger than before and offers 48 megapixels of resolution.The hardware of the other cameras is largely unchanged, however, with no physical change to the sensors in the main or ultrawide cameras, and all three cameras offer 48 megapixels. The front camera has been updated, however, with a new square-format 18-megapixel sensor that allows for cropping in either horizontal or landscape orientation and better digital stabilization in video.
Apple/Screenshot by CNETVideo shooters haven't been forgotten either; the Pro phones can now shoot in Apple's ProRes Raw codec -- an update to the existing ProRes codec that captures a lot more data at the point of capture, allowing for deeper and more accurate post processing. ProRes Raw, as Apple explains, is an industry standard in professional cinematic productions and seeing it on a phone is wild. As both a photographer, video producer and YouTuber, I'm excited. iPhone 17 Pro: A19 Pro processorThe A19 Pro processor features an improved CPU and GPU, which Apple reckons can achieve 40% better performance than the iPhone 16 Pro. Keeping things cool is a new thermal management system that includes a vapor chamber that uses de-ionized water to actively cool the phone as it gets hot. The aluminum alloy also apparently dissipates heat 20x better than the titanium design of previous models.
Apple/Screenshot by CNETiPhone 17 Pro: iOS 26The iPhone 17 range will launch with the latest iOS 26 software on board. We've played around with iOS 26 in its early beta form, and the biggest changes are to the software's look. Apple's new "Liquid Glass" design leans into glasslike transparency in its menus and notification panels to achieve a brighter, more modern look.From the images I've seen so far, I'm pretty keen on the style. CNET's Blake Stimac has tested the beta and says, "underneath it all, Liquid Glass doesn't reinvent the wheel, and that's a good thing." I find that encouraging. I can't be bothered learning my way around an entirely new operating system, but I'm happy to see any tweaks that keep things feeling fresh. iPhone 17 Pro: BatteryApple says the iPhone 17 Pro packs the largest battery ever on an iPhone, which, as a result, delivers the best battery life ever from any iPhone. The company hasn't been specific about exactly how big this battery is, but as always, we'll be keen to see how it performs.The iPhone Pro launched alongside other new Apple products, including the skinny iPhone Air, the latest AirPods Pro 3 with live translation and the Apple Watch Series 11, SE 3 and Watch Ultra 3. Don't fancy the Pro iPhone? Apple also took the wraps off the base iPhone 17.
