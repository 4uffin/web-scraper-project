Apple Watch Series 11 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: The Top Highlights of Each Smartwatch
Apple and Samsung are including a wealth of health and fitness features to pump up their flagship watches. Here is how they compare.
Nicole Lee Writer I started my career with CNET all the way back in 2005, when the (original) Motorola Razrs were all the rage. Since then, I've written about everything from consumer electronics to internet culture for outlets like CNET, Engadget and Yahoo. Outside of work, I'm a big fan of baseball, board games, tabletop RPGs and improv comedy.

Apple Watch Series 11 and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 both have many health and fitness features. Apple/Samsung/Cole Kan/CNET
The Apple Watch has long positioned itself as a leader in the smartwatch space, and the new Series 11 watch includes several key updates that provide improvements over previous models. These include 5G connectivity for the cellular model and new health features like hypertension notifications and Sleep Score analysis. Yet, Apple does face plenty of competition from other companies, with Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch 8 providing a compelling alternative for people looking for a watch that pairs with an Android phone. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a lightweight design, access to the Gemini assistant and Samsung's own suite of health features like its new Running Coach.If you're not tied to either the Apple or Android ecosystem, it's worth taking a look at both to see which one you prefer. We've compiled several comparison points below to help make your decision easier. See Apple Watch Series 11 at AppleSee Galaxy Watch 8 at SamsungDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
The Apple Watch Series 11 now has Sleep Score analysis. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNETDesign and displayEven before we delve into their features, the most obvious difference between the two watches is in how they look. The Watch Series 11 retains the same square frame that prior Apple Watch have always had, along with a thin profile and edge-to-edge display.The Galaxy Watch 8, on the other hand, has a circular display that is more reminiscent of traditional watches and might appeal more to those who want a rounder shape. The Galaxy Watch 8 is not completely round, however. It has a square base, which makes the overall effect more of a squircle than a normal circle.
The Galaxy Watch 8 comes in two sizes: 40mm (pictured) and 44mm. It also comes in a silver and graphite aluminum finish.  Joseph Maldonado/CNETSize-wise, the Apple Watch Series 11 is available in 42mm and 46mm sizes while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is available in 40mm and 44mm. The difference might be minimal, but if you have a smaller wrist, you might prefer the smaller Galaxy Watch 8. In terms of their displays, the Apple Watch Series 11 has an OLED Retina display while the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 has a Super AMOLED. The Galaxy Watch 8's display gets brighter, with a peak of 3,000 nits while the Apple Watch Series 11's brightness can range from 1 to 2,000 nits.While the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is only available in aluminum (black or grey), the Apple Watch Series 11 is available in both aluminum and titanium in a variety of different finishes (jet black, rose gold or silver in the aluminium, and slate, gold or natural in the titanium).
The Apple Watch Series 11 adds hypertension alerts. Apple/Cole Kan/CNETHealth and safety featuresBoth of these watches offer basic health sensors like ECG, advanced heart rate, blood oxygen and temperature tracking, with a few differences. The Galaxy Watch 8 offers a skin analysis feature that tracks carotenoids and advanced heart metrics, while the Apple Watch Series 11 offers a new hypertension warning if you're showing signs of high blood pressure. It doesn't replace a blood pressure monitor, but Apple says it could still be an important screening tool so you can look into the issue further. They also have slightly different sleep features. The Galaxy Watch 8 has a Bedtime Guidance tool to help you figure out the best bedtime window depending on your circadian rhythm, which could improve your overall sleep quality. The Apple Watch Series 11, on the other hand, now offers a Sleep Score that'll grade your sleep quality from 1 to 100 along with other sleep data like number of interruptions and sleep duration.
The Gemini assistant, seen here on the Classic edition of the Galaxy Watch 8, can handle advances queries. Numi Prasarn/CNETThe Galaxy Watch 8 offers the Gemini voice assistant, which at this point is able to handle more advanced queries than Siri on the Apple Watch Series 11. As for the coaching apps, the Galaxy Watch 8 offers the Samsung Running Coach, which supposedly helps you with improving your runs, while the Apple Watch Series 11 has Workout Buddy, which offers motivation during workouts. Both watches offer fall detection and SOS alerts, but the Apple Watch Series 11 has additional safety checks like vehicle-crash detection.Battery lifeWhen it comes to battery life, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and the Apple Watch Series 11 are about the same. Both easily last more than 24 hours, which is especially great for sleep tracking. In our testing, we found that the Galaxy Watch 8 lasts around 30 hours with a single charge, while we managed to get around 27 to 32 hours per charge on the Apple Watch Series 11.
