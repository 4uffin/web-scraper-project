Reviews ethics statement
How we test
What to consider
Budget
Determine how much you're willing to spend on wireless earbuds and how that lines up with quality and functionality.
Fit
Your earbuds should offer a comfortable, secure fit. The seal will determine how noise-isolating they are, so keep an eye out for how tight of a seal they provide.
Return policy
In case the earbuds break or aren't a great fit for your ears, it's important that the retailer offers a good return policy.
Durability
You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality with a high IP rating.
Features
Determine which features matter most for your specific use cases -- commuting, exercise, professional calls -- and invest in a pair of buds accordingly rather than paying for features you may not use.
Battery life
Consider how long you anticipate using your earbuds between charges. Single-charge runtime typically ranges from 5-12 hours, with ANC reducing battery life by about 20-30%.
Noise cancellation
If you know you'll be listening in busier environments, look for earbuds with ANC. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology uses microphones and special processors to generate anti-noise that neutralizes any ambient sound.

Back to selection
Wireless earbuds come in a variety of designs, including open and noise-isolating models with silicone ear tips. That said, the category is now dominated by true-wireless earbuds, many of which have active noise canceling.

Wireless earbuds FAQ
The best wireless earbuds not only fit comfortably and deliver impressive sound quality but also feature effective noise cancellation and strong voice-calling performance. While several of my picks are pricier premium models, I've also included some top budget earbuds that I consider a good value. I've fully reviewed or done hands-on testing with all the earbuds on this list, which I update regularly as new top wireless earbuds are released.What are the best wireless earbuds overall? With so many great earbud options, it's hard to declare one model the best overall. Apple's new AirPods Pro 3, which feature a host of improvements, including a better fit, noise canceling and sound quality, currently top our list and are easy to recommend to Apple users. Bose's new QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) also feature superb noise canceling and excellent sound quality. The Earfun Air Pro 4 remains a top value pick. And the recently added Anker Soundcore P41i is also affordable ($80) and has a notable new feature: its charging case doubles as a power bank to charge your phone should it run low on juice.What We Updated: September 2025We added the Apple AirPods Pro 3 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) and removed the AirPods Pro 2, Nothing Ear and Beats Fit Pro, as rumors and leaks suggest that Nothing and Beats will soon update those models.Best wireless earbuds of 2025

Best wireless earbuds overall
Apple AirPods Pro 3
Pros
Design upgrades to the buds and ear tips improve their fit
Noise cancellation has been upgraded and is now top-notch
They sound better with improved bass response and more clarity
Built-in heart-rate monitoring with new sensors
Excellent voice-calling performance (upgraded microphones)
Battery life is rated for up to 8 hours (up from 6 for AirPods Pro 2)
Cons
They still use the H2 chip found in the AirPods Pro 2
Heart-rate monitoring is buried in fitness apps
While they work with Android, many of their features are exclusive to Apple devices
Some new colors would be nice
While they didn't get a new H3 chip, and I was hoping that the charging case would be able to convert into a Bluetooth transceiver to use the buds on a plane with an in-flight entertainment system, I did get most of what I was looking for in the AirPods Pro 3. The changes may seem incremental to some folks, but all the key elements, such as fit, sound quality and noise cancellation, have been noticeably leveled up along with a single-charge battery. They're about as close as earbuds get to being complete: excellent noise cancellation, strong voice-calling performance and sound quality that rivals the very best. Few buds excel in all three areas -- and the Pro 3s manage it while packing in plenty of extra features, including their new heart-rate monitoring feature.

Top Bose earbuds with superb noise canceling
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen)
Pros
Excellent sound and improved noise-canceling that's truly impressive
Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit
New Immersive Audio Cinema mode for video content that also improves speech clarity for spoken-word content
Slightly improved voice-calling
Wireless charging has finally been added
Cons
Hardware changes don't really amount to a true 2.0 product
Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life
As far as the hardware goes, the QC Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) look exactly the same as the original QC Ultra Earbuds, although Bose has added a new plum color to the line. There are two small changes. The 2nd Gen Ultra Earbuds now support wireless charging, a feature that should have been available with the originals. The included ear tips now have wax guards, a fancy way of saying there's a silicone mesh that now covers the holes in the tips. The reality is, they don't seem like a true 2.0 product. But they do feature improved adaptive noise canceling that's truly impressive (it's neck-and-neck with the Apple AirPods Pro 3's noise canceling for the best ANC in a set of earbuds), along with some sound quality enhancements, including a new spatialized immersive audio Cinema mode that widens the soundstage and makes "video content more lifelike" with clearer dialog. The mode also helps with spoken-word audio content like podcasts and audiobooks.New features available in both the original QC Ultra Earbuds and Gen 2 model include:Bose SpeechClaritySpotify TapTurn capacitive controls on/offGeneral connectivity and stability improvementsFeature upgrades available exclusively to the Gen 2 model include:Enhanced adaptive noise cancellationReduced noise floor (the faint hiss in noise-canceling mode)Case battery reportingCinema Mode   ...

Top-sounding earbuds from Panasonic
Technics EAH-AZ100
Pros
Top-notch sound quality sound with upgraded Magnetic Fluid drivers
More compact design should offer more secure, comfortable fit for more ears
Slightly improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Triple multipoint Bluetooth pairing
Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking
Five ear tip sizes with new medium-large option
Cons
Premium price point
Battery life drops significantly (by 30%) when using the LDAC audio codec, spatial audio and noise cancellation features
Buds still stick out of your ears a little more than some buds
Voice-calling performance could be slightly better
Panasonic's new flagship earbuds, the Technics EAH-AZ100, feature a more compact design than the earlier EAH-AZ80 buds (the AZ100s are 10% smaller and 16% lighter) along with improved sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. One of the key upgrade here is Panasonic's newly developed proprietary Magnetic Fluid Driver that Panasonic says creates "clean, high-resolution, low-vibration and low-distortion sounds for the most authentic, balanced audio that's true to the original source." This type of driver is found in Technics high-end EAH-TZ700 wired in-ear monitors ($1,200), and it's been miniaturized for use in the AZ100s.I thought the AZ80s sounded really good, and these new AZ100s sound even better, with clean, accurate sound that brings out details in your music you don't hear with lesser earbuds (Android users get support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). As for extra features, there's Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking, plus you can pair with up to 3 devices simultaneously (most multipoint Bluetooth-enabled earbuds allow you to pair to two devices). Reasons to buyThe Technics EAH-AZ100 are among the best-sounding earbuds, so if sound quality is a priority, they should be on your short list. Also, the fact that their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved slightly is icing on the cake,Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 don't sound as good as these earbuds, they do offer superior noise canceling and voice-calling performance for less money along with an even more robust feature set, particularly for iPhone users.  ...

Best wireless earbuds from Sony
Sony WF-1000XM5
9.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Touch controls make for easy use
New smaller design with four ear tip sizes included
Improved sound, noise canceling and voice calling with upgraded processors and drivers
Spatial audio with head-tracking for Android users
Cons
Pricey
No Find My feature integrated into app
Companion app crashed several times during use
Not ideal for Apple users
Why I like themWhen Sony set out to design its WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds, it was looking to address some gripes folks had with their predecessor, the WF-1000XM4 earbuds that came out in 2021. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling performance. Overall they're impressive -- easily among the top earbuds on the market. Equipped with 8.2mm speaker driver units and two new proprietary Sony chipsets (V2 Integrated and QN2e Noise-Canceling processors), the earbuds deliver rich sound with nice detail, clear mids and punchy, well-defined bass. Read my full WF-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyI try a lot of new earbuds but I keep coming back the the WF-1000XM5s because they're just all-around very good earbuds, with strong overall performance and a solid feature set, including LDAC audio codec support for Android users and Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature that automatically lowers the volume of your music and puts the earbuds into ambient sound mode so you can easily have a conversation without removing your buds. Also, now that the buds have been out for around two years, they're often on sale and you can also find well-priced refurbished units.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile these earbuds are more compact and should be a good fit for more people's ears, they still might not fit some ears. Not everybody will get a tight seal from the included foam ear tips, even though they're available in four size options. Also, note that next-gen Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds should be coming in 2026.  ... Show more

Top value noise-canceling earbuds
Earfun Air Pro 4
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Impressive overall performance for the price
Very good, slightly warm sound with slight bass push that can be tweaked in user-friendly companion app
Decent noise canceling and background noise reduction for voice calling
Support for AAC, AptX and LDAC audio codecs
Robust feature set (wireless charging, ear-detection sensors, multipoint Bluetooth 5.4)
Cons
Touch controls are a bit finicky
Voice-calling performance could be better in noisier environments
Why I like themEarfun is one of our go-to brands for budget earbuds and its Air Pro 4 buds (read my full review) are one of the better earbuds values out there, which is why I awarded them an CNET Editors' Choice in 2024. While they aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Apply the code EAP4CNET at checkout on Amazon to get an additional 10% off).Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs.Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much.Reasons to buyAs I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio).Reason to skip/keep lookingThe voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. And lastly, I should note that Earfun will release the slightly updated Air 4 Pro Plus this fall, though it'll likely be more expensive than this model at launch.  ... Show more

Best-sounding noise-canceling earbuds under $100
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Impressive sound with "Sound by Bose" technology that beats out competitors in the price range
Comfortable, secure fit with three ear tip and "fit fin" sizes designed to keep buds in your ears during sporting activities
Good battery life (40 hours total)
Ear-detection sensors and touch controls are well-implemented and customizable in Skullcandy-iQ app
Cons
Charging case is bulky and little tricky to put buds into
Lack the premium finish of Bose's expensive buds
Noise-canceling is decent but not great
In my voice-calling tests, Callers said they couldn't hear me well in noisy environments
Why I like themIn a surprise move, Skullcandy has joined forces with Bose to create a budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. With "Sound by Bose," not only do the Method 360 ANC buds sound better than most earbuds in this price class (they sound very similar to Bose's $170 QuietComfort Earbuds), they also fit comfortably and securely thanks to Bose's Fit Kit system that features stability bands to lock the buds in your ears. While they share many traits of Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they're lighter and lack the more premium finish of those pricey buds. Also, their noise canceling isn't up to the QC Ultra's best-in-class ANC standard. But it's still effective and better than the noise canceling I experienced with previous Skullcandy earbuds I've tested. Read the Skullcandy Method 360 ANC review.Reasons to buyWhile you can find earbuds that sound pretty decent for this price (or a little more), the Method 360 ANC's sound quality is a notch up from what you typically find at this price. Another selling point is that these buds should fit most ears comfortably and securely, thanks to the Bose-like design.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Method 360 ANC's only potential drawback is its large carrying case, and the buds are a little bigger than most. Some people won't mind that the case is bulky, but it may be a deal-breaker for some folks. Also, voice-calling performance could be better, but hopefully that will improve with firmware updates.  ... Show more

Best wireless earbuds for Samsung users
Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable to wear
Dual driver design (10mm dynamic driver plus Planar tweeter) for excellent sound quality with superior treble clarity and bass definition
Impressive feature set, including Voice Detect and built-in voice controls (no wake word required)
Top-notch voice-calling performance with very good noise reduction
High-quality ambient sound mode that sounds natural
Lights in buds are kind of cool
Cons
A little pricey
Some people may not be get a tight seal from the included ear tips, which have proprietary design
Design looks a tad generic and touch controls are a bit finicky
Noise canceling could be slightly better
Why I like themThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro stand out with their excellent fit, impressive sound quality and top-notch voice-calling performance. Though Samsung has added stems (it calls them "blades" and they have integrated LEDs) to these flagship earbuds, this new design works better for more people -- I found the buds lightweight and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is noticeably improved from the previous Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, with superior treble clarity and bass definition, producing a cleaner, more accurate sound. The ambient mode, which lets external sound into the buds, works very well, sounding natural with no audible hiss. And I liked that the buds have their own built-in voice-commands (they do not require a wake word like Google Assistant or Siri), an underrated feature. Read my Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review. Reasons to buySamsung had some kinks to work out with these buds at launch (they paused shipping them for a time), but they're excellent earbuds, with improved performance across the board. The stem design is a little controversial for fans of previous Galaxy buds, but I like their design and they're essentially Samsung's version of the AirPods Pro 2 but geared towards Android users and Galaxy device owners in particular who can take advantage of a few Samsung-only features like support for its "high-resolution" Samsung Seamless Codec (there's a Galaxy Wear app for Android users).Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile I've used them with my iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone users should probably look elsewhere, as there's no iOS app, meaning all updates and settings are only available via the Galaxy Wear app for Android. Those seeking the absolute best noise cancellation available might be disappointed, as the ANC, while good, is slightly behind what's offered by competitors. Finally, users with larger ear canals may not be able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips (only three sizes are provided). Since the ear tips are custom-designed for these buds, finding compatible third-party options can be challenging.  ... Show more

Best earbuds with power bank built into charging case
Anker Soundcore P41i
Pros
Charging case has a built-in 3,000 mAh battery and USB-C cable for charging smartphones and other devices
Buds are lightweight and comfortable to wear
Decent sound quality with strong bass performance
Case also has built-in standing to prop up your phone
Very good battery life
Cons
Case is a little bulky and heavy
No ear-detection sensors
Case does not charge wirelessly
Why I like themAnker's earlier Soundcore P40 buds have a stand built into their charging case for propping your phone up for video watching. The new-for-2025 P41i not only includes an integrated stand, but also a 3,000-mAh battery and USB-C cable that turns the case into a power bank for charging your phone. (Owners of older iPhones can also get a version with an integrated Lightning cable that costs $10 more.) While the case is a little heavy and bulkier than many earbuds cases, I like the two-devices-in-one concept. Note that while it doesn't offer high-speed charging, it does charge at 10W speeds, which isn't too shabby.As for the buds themselves, while they lack such extra features as ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear, they offer decent sound with strong bass performance and decent noise-canceling and voice-calling capabilities. The sound isn't as rich or detailed as what you get with more premium buds, but it's respectably smooth and steers clear of any harshness. Battery life is also good: A single charge gets you up to 10 hours of playback time at moderate volumes with ANC on. And if you don't use the case to charge your phone (it will charge an iPhone 16 to about 50%), it has enough juice to charge the buds around 15 times.Reasons to buy themYou like the idea of combining your earbuds with a power bank to charge your phone in a pinch.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you like your earbuds cases small, these probably aren't the buds for you. While the case isn't huge, it's heavier and larger than a lot cases because it does have a 3,000-mAh battery in it. Typically, earbuds charging cases are equipped with 300-mAh to 700-mAh batteries (the AirPods Pro 2's charging case has a 523-mAh battery by comparison).  ... Show more

Best open earbuds with active noise canceling
Apple AirPods 4 with ANC
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
More compact design (should fit more ears securely than Airpods 3)
First open earbuds with effective Active noise canceling (ANC)
Improved sound quality with new acoustic architecture
Equipped with Apple's powerful H2 chip that enables a robust feature set and faster digital processing
Case has wireless charging and speaker for Find My (missing from entry-level model, however)
Cons
Even with slightly smaller design, the buds may not be a good fit for some ears
Battery life could be a little better
Noise-canceling is only about half as good as the AirPods Pro's ANC
Why I like themThe AirPods 4 are, unsurprisingly, the fourth generation of Apple's original true-wireless earbuds that feature an open design, which means they don't have silicone eartips like the AirPods Pro 2. Not only do they feature a slightly smaller design and better sound than their predecessor, but they're equipped with Apple's H2 chip that improves overall performance and powers Apple's ever-expanding AirPods features. However, they don't have the AirPods Pro 2's Hearing Aid mode. Read my Apple AirPods 4 review.The AirPods 4 come in two versions: a $129 entry-level model and a $179 step-up model with active noise cancellation (ANC). ANC is a rare feature for open earbuds because it typically doesn't work with an open design, but these are the first open buds I've tried to have active noise cancellation that actually works (it's about half as strong as the AirPods Pro 2's noise cancellation). That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it.Reasons to buyA lot of people don't like having eartips jammed in their ears and find open earbuds more comfortable (plus, you can hear the outside world for safety reasons), and the AirPods 4 are made for those Apple users. They also sound very good for open earbuds and feature excellent voice-calling performance along with Apple's spatial audio and likable pinch controls. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Canceling are more special simply because of noise canceling. At the same time, the AirPods 4 with ANC noise muffling capabilities aren't that great compared to what you get with the AirPods Pro 2 and top noise-canceling earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds or the Sony WF-1000XM5. But that it works at all and is reasonably effective is kind of wild because, as I said, noise canceling and open earbuds usually aren't a good mix.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile their slightly smaller, updated design fits a wider range of ears more securely, some folks may not get a secure fit. The AirPods Pro 2 offer a more flexible fit because they include four different sizes of ear tips. They also deliver better sound with more bass and significantly better noise canceling in a noise-isolating design.

Best wireless earbuds for Android
Google Pixel Buds Pro 2
8.6

SCORE
Pros
Smaller design for lightweight, comfortable feel
New, more powerful Tensor A1 chip for improved sound and noise-canceling
Good voice-calling performance with Google's "Clear Calling" technology
"Hands-free, eyes-free" Gemini AI Google Assistant for Android users
Spatial audio
Cons
Ear tips may not allow some people to get a tight seal
No support for AptX or LDAC audio codecs for Android users
A few features not available for Apple users
Why I like themWhen they're in your ears, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 look a lot like the original Pixel Buds Pro and retain the stabilizer fins that help lock the buds in your ears. But they're smaller than their predecessor and Google equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and boosts their performance across the board. How you ultimately feel about them will largely depend on how well they fit your ears. That's the case for most noise-canceling earbuds, but with the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you don't get a tight seal from the included ear tips, there's a massive dip in both sound quality and noise-canceling performance. If you do get a tight seal, these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. Read my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.Reasons to buyFor Pixel device owners, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have some extra appeal because they're designed to work more seamlessly with your Pixel devices (there's automatic switching between Pixel smartphones, tablets and watches) and also feature "Clear Calling" for Pixel smartphones, which does improve voice calling performance a bit. That said, Android owners can take advantage of most of the Pixel Buds Pro 2's features, including hands-free Google Assistant and "Conversation Detect" feature that pauses what you're listening to and puts the buds in transparency mode when you start talking to someone.Reasons to skip/keep lookingI'll start by pointing out that while buds work just fine with iPhones, iPhone users miss out out several features, so Apple users should probably look elsewhere. From an ergonomic standpoint, the buds' smaller design should provide a better fit for a wider range of ears, but some people may find that the original Pixel Buds Pro fit their ears better. Also, some Android owners may be disappointed that the buds support neither Qualcomm's AptX or Sony's LDAC audio codecs (AAC and SBC are supported). Lastly, it's a little annoying that the white case can pick up stains from objects in pockets, though the case is easy enough to clean off with a alcohol wipe.  ... Show more

Beats Powerbeats Pro 2
8.8

SCORE
Pros
Improved design: buds are 20% lighter, case is 33% smaller, and ear hook is slimmer, incorporating nickel-titanium alloy
Equipped with Apple's more powerful H2 chip
Improved noise canceling and natural-sounding transparency mode
Very good sound quality
Excellent voice-calling performance with new microphones and voice accelerometers to help pinpoint your voice
Built-in heart-rate sensors
Physical control buttons work well during athletic activities

A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2 (no Precision Finding, Conversation Awareness or Adaptive Audio)
Some Apple-exclusive features unavailable to Android users
Built-in heart-rate monitor may not seem like a needed feature to some people
Why I like themThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.These new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.Reasons to buyFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).  ...

Cons

Noise-canceling isn't as good as that from Bose and Sony

Why I like themWhenever a new pair of Momentum True Wireless earbuds drops, I always find myself saying, "Wow, these sound good." Sound quality has always been the MTW's biggest strength, and that remains the case with the fourth-gen version. There have been some modest improvements in other areas, particularly with the noise cancellation performance and the reliable, hiccup-free Bluetooth connection I had with my phone. At the same time, the voice-calling performance could be better, and I'm a little disappointed that these aren't even more of an upgrade over their predecessor. Still, the Momentum True Wireless 4 are excellent earbuds that I have no problem recommending, particularly when they're discounted.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy these is for their audiophile-grade, natural, accurate sound. And while the buds are a tad large, I like their design (they fit my ears well), and the case is nice, too. But look for them at a discount because they've been out since February 2024.Reasons to skip/keep lookingSome competing models, like the AirPods Pro 2, are more compact, have a much more robust feature set, and offer better noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. However, if you prefer earbuds with bigger bass, these may not be for you.

Cons
No wireless charging capabilities
Missing several extra features that you get with the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, including spatial audio
No ear-detection sensors
Why I like themCompared to the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market, the newer Studio Buds Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. Read my Beats Buds Plus review.The transparent version got a lot of attention at launch (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' "acoustic architecture" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds.Reasons to buyThe compact Beats Studio Buds Plus offer good sound quality and strong all-around performance for an affordable price, especially when they're discounted, which they often are. It's also worth noting that like with other Beats headphones and earbuds, these are more Android-friendly than Apple's AirPods (there's a Beats app for Android) and the only feature that Apple users get that Android users don't is hands-free Siri.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Studio Buds Plus were released in May of 2023, so they're over two years old and may be due for an upgrade.

Best-sounding wireless earbuds
Bowers & Wilkins Pi8
Pros
Top-notch sound from carbon-coated 12mm drivers
Smaller design and improved fit
Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Wireless-charging-enabled case also transforms into a Bluetooth transceiver
Touch controls are sensitive and work well
Qualcomm's AptX Lossless audio codec supported for Bluetooth streaming (though only certain Android smartphones support the codec)
Cons
Expensive
Some other premium earbuds have superior noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
Not as robust feature set compared to that of some premium competitors
Why I like themSimply put, the Pi8s are fantastic-sounding earbuds that benefit from a clearly improved design from the Pi7 S2 and Pi5 S2. It's debatable whether the Pi8s sound $150 better than the step-down Pi6s, but there's no doubt these are some of the best-sounding earbuds on the market, if not the best (everybody's sound tastes vary, so it's hard to declare one set of buds the best-sounding overall). Like with the Pi7 S2, sound quality is the highlight here, along with the charging case's ability to transform into a Bluetooth transceiver. Noise cancellation seems improved, and noise reduction during calls seems better, but the voice-calling performance wasn't as good as what I got with Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.Reasons to buyThe Pi8 earbuds are easily among the top earbuds for sound quality, with refined, spacious sound and deep, well-defined bass. Also, their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved from their predecessor, making them better earbuds all around. Lastly, the fact that the case can turn into a Bluetooth transceiver is a nice feature for frequent travelers who want to use their wireless earbuds with an in-flight entertainment system.
Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Pi8 are pricey earbuds that will be out of many people's price range. And while models like the AirPods Pro 2 may not feature as impressive sound quality, they do offer slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance (and some other extra features) and cost less.

Wireless charging enabled
Support for LDAC audio codec for Android users
along with AAC
Cons
Noise canceling is good but not top notch
Charging case is a tad heavy
Not as robust feature set as AirPods Pro 2
Why I like themThe Live Beam 3 earbuds look similar to the earlier Live Buds Pro 2, which I liked a lot, especially when they go on sale for less than $100. Essentially JBL's AirPods Pro 2 competitor, their distinguishing feature is the 1.45-inch touchscreen LCD integrated into their charging case that acts as a remote control for the buds and allows you to access their features. Equipped with 10mm drivers, not only do they offer clear, well-defined sound with punchy bass, but their noise canceling and voice-calling performance is very solid. Their battery is also good -- they offer up to 10 hours of battery life with ANC on and 12 hours with it off at moderate volume levels (a 10-minute charge gives you four hours of battery life). Available in four color options, they're IP55 splash-proof and dust-resistant.Note that JBL's flagship Tour Pro 3 earbuds also have an integrated LCD but feature dual drivers, which deliver even better sound than these buds with a little more depth and detail. However, the Live Beam 3 often sells for $50 off their $200 list price, which makes it a better deal overall.Reasons to buyThe Live Beam 3 buds are solid-performing, well-designed earbuds that comfortably fit most ears. Some may see the touchscreen LCD as a bit of a gimmick, but it is useful as a remote control for the buds and a differentiating feature.Reasons to skip/keep lookingMy only minor gripes are that the buds look a tad cheap for their somewhat elevated list price. Also, the charging case is a bit larger and heavier than most charging cases because it has that built-in touchscreen LCD.  ... Show more

Bose Ultra Open Earbuds
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight buds with innovative clip-on design and comfortable fit (at times, you barely notice you're wearing them)
Very good sound for open earbuds with ample bass, good clarity and nice openness
Decent voice-calling performance with good voice clarity
Customizable, easy-access control button on the barrel of each bud
Cons
Expensive
Look may not appeal to everyone
Not great for noisy environments (outside sound can impact sound quality)
They weren't the first clip-on earbuds, but Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds really kickstarted this sub-genre of true-wireless earbuds. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. They're somewhat overpriced, but there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds. Initially, the buds didn't feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing, but the feature was added in July 2024. Read my Bose Ultra Open Earbuds review.Reasons to buyIf you're looking for open earbuds that allow you to hear the outside world, Bose's Ultra Earbuds are among the best out there. They feature a very comfortable, secure fit with strong sound quality for open earbuds in a premium design.Reason to skip/keep lookingThey're a little overpriced. I'd like to see these closer to $200 (they often go on sale for $250).  ... Show more

The OpenFit 2 in their case. David Carnoy/CNET
Top wireless earbuds for runners and bikers
Shokz OpenFit 2
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable with integrated ear hooks
Are among the best-sounding open earbuds
Improved battery life (up to 11 hours)
Both physical buttons and touch control for ease of use while running or working out
Good voice-calling performance
Cons
Somewhat pricey
Charging case is not dust- or water-resistant
Why I like themShokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds, at least in quieter environments. Read my Shokz OpenFit 2 review.Reasons to buyWhile the Shokz OpenFit 2 is a little pricey, it's among the best open earbuds with ear hooks. It features a comfortable, durable design, strong sound quality (for open earbuds), good voice-calling performance and improved controls. Because of these traits, it is near the top of my list of the best headphones and earbuds for runners. It also works well for bikers and anyone who doesn't like having ear tips jammed in their ears.Reasons to skip/keep lookingYou can find cheaper open earbuds with ear hooks that may not sound quite as good, but they're pretty close and are a better overall value.

Best new earbuds from Anker
Anker Soundcore Liberty 5
Pros
Comfortable fit and attractive design
Improved noise canceling
Upgraded voice-calling performance with better noise reduction
Good battery life (up to 8 hours with ANC on)
Sliding cover is convenient
Cons
Would ideally be priced closer to $100
A touch of sibilance in the treble
Why I like themAfter Anker confused consumers with multiple versions of its Liberty 4 earbuds at different prices, we get the new-for-2025 Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. Their sound quality is about the same or a tad better than that of the lower-priced Liberty 4 NC -- it's pretty good but not great -- but the adaptive noise canceling and voice-calling performance have noticeably improved, with better noise reduction during calls. The AirPods-like buds fit my ears well and have good all-around performance at a more affordable price than the AirPods Pro 2. While some people may not love the new pinch controls (there's a physical button in the stem), I liked them, and the compact case has a sliding lid that doesn't pop open when you drop the case.Anker says the buds have 2x stronger voice reduction, which means the buds do a better job of muffling people's voices around you (that was the case in my tests). As I said, the sound is good but not great (Anker says the buds have "wool paper diaphragms" and "bass-enhancing tubes"). Out of the box, you get a smiley face sound profile with strong bass, slightly accentuated treble and slightly recessed mids (there's a bit of sibilance in the treble). You can play around with the equalizer settings to improve the sound a bit and optimize it to your preference. Android users should note that buds support Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec for Bluetooth streaming, while the AAC codec is available for both iOS and Android users.The Liberty 5 are IP55 splash-proof -- they can withstand a sustained spray of water -- and dust resistant. Battery life is good -- the buds are rated for up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on and 10 hours with noise canceling off. Though the buds list for $130, we could see them discounted to closer to $100 later in 2025, so long as tariffs don't jump too high.Reasons to buyThe Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 are solid all-around wireless earbuds that offer good sound quality and improved noise-canceling and voice-calling performance for a fairly affordable price.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThey're a reasonable value at their list price, but I'd ideally like to see them priced closer to $100.  ...

Best Sony earbuds with a secure fit
Sony LinkBuds Fit
Pros
Lightweight with a comfortable, secure fit thanks to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters and redesigned ear tips
Very good sound with a bass-forward, dynamic sound profile
Good noise canceling
Strong voice-calling performance with good background noise reduction
Built-in voice controls and Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature
Optional accessories available to customize the look of the buds and case
Cons
Overpriced at their list price
No wireless charging
Why I like themTruth be told, in some ways, I like Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than its flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound as good or have noise-canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its eartips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls.Reasons to buyIn many ways, these are Sony's answer to Beats' Fit Pro earbuds, which were released in late 2021 and became very popular. Not only do they sound good, but they're lightweight and comfortable and fit securely in your ears thanks to their sport fins, making them good for both everyday use and sporting activities.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe biggest problem with the LinkBuds Fit is that its list price is too high (it's overpriced at full price). However, it does get discounted now, and it's more enticing when it dips below $150 (it'd ideally cost closer to $130).

Top new audiophile wireless earbuds
Noble Fokus Amadeus
Pros
Great sound
Attractively designed with a "bold red finish that pays tribute to Mozart's signature tailcoat"
Despite their large size, they fit my ears comfortably
Good battery life
Noise canceling is decent for audiophile buds that prioritize sound quality
Wireless charging
Cons
The buds stick out of your ears pretty far (they're pretty large)
Noise canceling is a step behind Sony's, Bose's and Apple's
No water-resistance rating
Noble, the maker of "artisanal" in-ear monitors and headphones, is edging into the more mainstream earbuds market with its most affordable buds yet, after releasing its Fokus Mystiq ($359), Rex 5 ($449) and Prestige ($599) models in recent years. While the Fokus Amadeus ($320) buds are on the large side, they do fit a little more comfortably than the company's earlier buds, and they feature active noise canceling. Though their noise muffling capabilities are merely decent (the ANC is certainly a step behind what you get with Bose and Sony flagship models), their sound quality is exceptionally good -- which is probably why they're currently backordered online (though you can reserve a pair).You can tweak the sound in the companion app for iOS and Android, where you'll also find Audiodo Personal Sound that customizes the sound based on your hearing profile, but I was happy with what I heard out of the box. The buds are equipped with 8.3mm custom triple-layer drivers, and the sound is open and nicely detailed, and the well-defined bass is deep and visceral without sounding boomy. Instruments feel distinctly and appropriately placed in the sound stage, and I appreciated that the natural sounding mids, where vocals live, are slightly forward and don't get eclipsed by the treble and bass (with the music I listen to, which includes a far amount of rock tracks, I don't like when the mids sound recessed).Noble's top-of-the-line Prestige buds are considered more analytical, which may be what some audiophiles are looking for. But the Amadeus buds have a bit warmer sound profile and aren't so revealing that they overly accentuate the flaws in less well-recorded tracks. These are buds you can use for long stretches without any listening fatigue, and they work well for a variety of music genres.Powered by Qualcomm's QCC3091 with Bluetooth 5.4, the buds have support for the AAC, LDAC and AptX Adaptive audio codecs. They have touch controls and are rated for 8 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and 12 hours with it off at moderate volume levels, which is better than average. Though they should withstand some light sweat, they have no water-resistance rating, so they aren't recommended as workout buds (they fit my ears pretty securely, but I wouldn't run with them). They worked pretty well for making calls, with decent noise reduction, but they're not top tier when it comes to voice-calling prowess. Again, the biggest reason to buy these is for their sound. They're easily among the best-sounding earbuds in this price class.  ... Show more

Best wireless earbuds from Beyerdynamic
Beyerdynamic Amiron 300
Pros
Comfortable, lightweight design that should fit most ears well
Very clean, crisp sound that's rich, detailed and fairly open with pleasant tonal balance and punchy bass
Good voice-calling performance with three microphones in each bud
Solid feature set, including wireless charging and ear-detection sensors
Touch controls work well
LDAC audio codec support for Android users
Decent voice-calling performance
User-friendly companion app allows you to tweak EQ settings
Cons
Fairly pricey
Noise-canceling is decent, but not great
Why I like themWhile Beyerdynamic’s original Free Byrd impressed with sound quality, the new Amiron 300 earbuds address the previous design shortcomings with a compact, lightweight form factor that fits my ears well. The sound quality is outstanding -- rich, detailed and fairly open with a very pleasant tonal balance out of the box. There's impressive instrument separation that allows you to distinctly hear each element in complex tracks. The bass response is particularly noteworthy -- articulate and punchy without overwhelming the mix -- while the midrange offers nice clarity and accuracy, which benefits vocal reproduction. Voice-calling performance is solid thanks to three microphones in each bud, with callers reporting they could hear me well even in noisy environments, with only minimal background noise intruding. Who they’re forThe Beyerdynamic Amiron 300 earbuds are perfect for audio enthusiasts who prioritize sound quality over absolute noise-cancellation performance. Those who wear earbuds for extended periods will appreciate the comfortable, lightweight design that avoids the bulkiness of the Free Byrd. Wireless charging users will appreciate the convenience, while anyone who enjoys fine-tuning their sound will welcome the ability to adjust EQ settings through Beyerdynamic's companion app. The earbuds are suitable for casual everyday use and more critical listening sessions, offering versatility for different scenarios and content types.Who should avoid themBudget-conscious shoppers should look elsewhere, as the Amiron 300s are pretty pricey compared to many competitors. Those who prioritize noise-cancellation above all else will be disappointed, as the ANC performance is decent, yet falls short of what you get with flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Sony, Bose and Apple. Those who prefer a more bass-heavy, consumer-oriented sound signature might find the accurate, balanced approach less exciting for certain music genres. Finally, those seeking the absolute latest technology innovations or unique features might find that these focus more on core performance than novel additions.   ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing wireless earbuds
Budget and performanceBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new true wireless earbuds. A quick tip -- consider the price-to-performance ratio rather than just the lowest price. Entry level models ($30-$80) typically offer decent sound but fewer premium features. Mid-range options ($80-$150) balance sound quality with features like basic ANC and water- and dust- resistance (IP ratings). Premium models ($150-$300+) deliver superior sound engineering, advanced noise cancellation, extended battery life and other specialized features. Determine which features matter most for your specific use cases -- commuting, exercise, professional calls -- and invest in a pair of buds accordingly rather than paying for features you may not use. Noise cancellationActive noise cancellation technology uses microphones and special processors to generate anti-noise that neutralizes any ambient sound. Adaptive ANC automatically adjusts to your environment, while adjustable systems let you control noise cancellation levels manually. Some premium models offer specialized noise cancellation for different environments (airplanes, traffic noise, ambient chatter). If you know you'll be listening in busier environments, look for earbuds with ANC. Do keep in mind that active noise cancellation can limit both battery life and sound quality, so if you're hoping to salvage those, look for buds that advertise a natural-sounding transparency mode that allows ambient sound in without digital artifacts. Battery lifeExpect to be using your buds for long stretches of time? Be sure to consider the battery life. Single-charge runtime typically ranges from 5-12 hours depending on feature usage, with ANC reducing battery life by about 20-30%. Charging cases should provide two to four full recharges, expending total playtime anywhere from 15 to 40 hours. If you're crunched for time, look for fast-charging capabilities that offer at least 1 hour of playback from 5-10 minutes of charging. Some premium models include wireless charging cases or even reverse charging from other devices like phones and laptops. Also consider battery degradation -- like any battery-powered device, expect maximum battery capacity to drop up to 80% from its original specifications after several charge cycles. General featuresToday's earbuds are often jam-packed with features that can make a huge difference in your listening habits. For one, connectivity technologies like Bluetooth 5.2+ offer improved range (up to 800 feet), lower power consumption and better connection stability, while Bluetooth multipoint connectivity allows simultaneous connection to multiple devices at once. If you want the best sound possible, advanced codec support impacts audio quality substantially. Look for AAC compatibility for Apple devices, or aptX Adaptive or LDAC for Android. Control interfaces vary from touch-sensitive panels to physical buttons and voice commands for those looking for easy ways to switch songs, adjust volume or answer calls. Microphone arrays with beamforming technology and AI noise suppression dramatically improve call quality if you're taking meetings on-the-go. Companion apps offer customizable EQ settings, firmware updates and location tracking features to keep your buds' features in one spot. Consider how you plan to use your buds and choose the features best suited to your needs. Durability and designYou want earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that I note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important with true wireless earbuds, which are more susceptible to loss or damage due to their size. Construction materials can impact longevity -- premium models use reinforced plastics, aluminum or even carbon fiber components to keep them safe from scratches and dents. Most wireless earbuds have an IP rating, or a designation of how dust- and waterproof a product is: IPX4 (splash resistant), IPX5 (protected against water jets), IPX7 (protected for immersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes) or the highest IP68 (fully dust- and water-proof). Buds with higher IP ratings are more likely to withstand the elements should you need your earbuds outside normal use. Be sure to consider the charging case's durability, too, with reinforced hinges and quality materials to prevent common failure points. Case dimensions are key for portability, so look for cases under 3 inches in length and 1.5 inches in height for a comfortable pocket fit. Keep in mind that while wireless charging compatibility adds convenience, it may slightly increase the size of the case. Fit and comfortIt's key that the earbuds you buy sit in your ears well and offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise cancelling can be dramatically impacted for the worse. Look for models with different ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) in different materials (silicone for durability, memory foam for comfort and isolation) to help achieve the proper fit. Also consider earbuds with fit tests in companion apps that analyze seal quality. If you plan on running or otherwise heavy movement in your earbuds, look for wingtips -- sometimes called sport fins -- that lock the buds in your ears. Keep in mind that many third-party vendors offer compatible ear tips and fins to help secure your earbuds if you can't find a model that fits your ears. Return policyI's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds break or aren't a good match for you and your listening needs. Manufacturer warranties typically range from 1-2 years, with premium brands often offering better customer service and replacement options. Research how companies handle common issues like single earbud failure or charging case defects. Retailer return policies supplement manufacturer warranties -- major electronics retailers typically allow 14-30 day returns, while specialized audio retailers sometimes offer more extended evaluation periods. If you're on the quest for the perfect earbuds, be sure to get a longer trial period to assess their performance.
How CNET tests wireless earbuds
I follow CNET's unbiased evaluation process for all of my wireless earbud testing. In the CNET sound lab, I compare similarly styled and priced models side-by-side based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, extra features, voice-calling and value. DesignI first assess how comfortable the true wireless earbuds fit (their ergonomics), typically testing each model for several hours across multiple days. I test all included ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) and evaluate their stability during movement or other physical activity. Build quality assessments include stress testing case hinges and folding mechanisms, examining material durability and verifying IPX ratings, or dust- and water-resistance through exposure to appropriate environmental conditions.
For earbuds with an IP rating, I expose the buds to both dust and water to test their durability.
David Carnoy/CNETSound quality I evaluate sound quality and music experience by listening to a set playlist of music tracks specifically selected to evaluate different frequency ranges and acoustic characteristics:
Frequency RangeTest TrackAcoustic Characteristics Sub-bass extension (20-60Hz) Spoon's "Knock Knock Knock"Features sustained low-frequency content that tests earbuds' ability to reproduce the deepest bass frequencies without distortion. The opening drum pattern and bass line provide excellent evaluation of sub-bass presence.Mid-bass articulation (60-200Hz) Drake's "Passionfruit"The prominent bass line throughout this track offers a perfect test for punch, attack, and control in the mid-bass region. The rhythmic foundation reveals how well earbuds handle bass definition and separation.Lower-midrange clarity (200-500Hz) The Doors' "Touch Me - Take 3"The foundational instruments in this track occupy the crucial lower-midrange, testing how earbuds handle the warmth and body of instruments without muddiness. Ray Manzarek's keyboard parts are especially revealing.Upper-midrange presence (500Hz-2kHz) Taylor Swift's "Vigilante Shit"Vocals predominantly live in this frequency range, and Swift's intimate vocal delivery provides an excellent reference for midrange clarity, presence, and articulation. The track also tests earbuds' ability to maintain vocal intelligibility.Lower-treble detail (2-8kHz) Athletes of God's "Don't Wanna Be Normal"Contains complex instrumental textures with significant content in the lower treble region, revealing how earbuds handle detail retrieval and instrumental separation without sibilance or harshness.Upper-treble extension (8-20kHz) Jvke's "Golden Hour"The atmospheric production and layered high-frequency content test earbuds' ability to reproduce air, space, and the highest overtones. The track reveals limitations in high-frequency extension and resolution.Dynamic range and transient response Orbital's "Dirty Rat"The electronic production features sharp transients and significant dynamic contrasts, testing earbuds' ability to handle micro-dynamics and maintain clarity during complex passages with multiple simultaneous elements.
Noise-canceling performanceI evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the earbuds in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they muffle lower frequencies (about 65dB of broadband noise). I then head out to the busy streets of New York City to use the buds in a real-world environment, testing their performance in: Public transit environments, like buses, trains and subway platforms (85-90dB of variable noise)Busy street intersections for traffic and construction noise (45-70dB of line source noise)Areas with ambient chatter and voices (70-75dB of speech-dominated noise)
I test wireless earbuds on the streets of New York City to see how they fare in noisy environments.
David Carnoy/CNETEach environment is tested several times.Extra featuresSome great-sounding earbuds aren't loaded with features, but I do take into account what extra features are on board and test them accordingly. Modern features include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation). I test special sound modes like EQ customization or bass modes as well as the efficiency of ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the earbuds out of your ears. Bluetooth connectivity is tested by subjecting the earbuds to a wireless range test or repeated device-switching if Bluetooth multipoint is included. I also take a look at the companion app for the earbuds (if there is one) and test its user-friendliness. Voice-calling performanceWhen I test voice-calling performance, I make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. We assess their reaction to traffic noise and windy conditions for microphone performance. We also move between quiet and noisy environments to test their response, then collect feedback from call recipients about voice clarity and background noise reduction.ValueFinally, I determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Great sounding, feature-packed headphones that offer a great bang for your buck earn top marks in this category.
Other top wireless earbuds we've tested
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: Bose has announced that it will be shipping its improved QC Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen) in the "summer" of 2025 in the U.S., which means you'll be able to find discounts on the original QC Ultra Earbuds, which feature excellent sound and previously best-in-class noise-canceling performance.Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC: Anker released the new Liberty 5 earbuds in 2025, but this 2023 model remains a decent value at around $90. It offers decent noise canceling and a similar level of sound quality as the Liberty 5 (it's quite good but not great). However, the Liberty 5 has improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance.Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Once included on this list, Jabra has discontinued the 2024 Elite 8 Active Gen 2 after announcing it decided to gradually wind down the Jabra Elite product line. Still, we liked their incredible durability (they survived several drops without a scratch) and enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio. They make for great sport earbuds if you can get your hands on them. I have a full Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 review if you're still interested in the discontinued buds. Sennheiser CX: If you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum True Wireless 3 earbuds, the CX are a good alternative. They feature very good sound, plus decent noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. The only issue is they stick out of your ears a bit and may not fit some smaller ears. This model, which often sells for less than $100 on Amazon, doesn't feature active noise cancellation but the step-up CX Plus does (the CX Plus is also a good value, particularly when it goes on sale). Learn more about the budget model in my Sennheiser CX true wireless earbud review. Beats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio Buds look a lot like the rumored stemless AirPods some people have been waiting for. Geared toward both iOS and Android users, they are missing a few key features on the Apple side of things (there's no H1 or W1 chip), but they're small, lightweight true wireless earbuds that are comfortable to wear and offer really good sound. Their noise cancellation isn't as good as the AirPods Pro's, but they do have a transparency mode and they're decent for making calls. Learn more in my fullBeats Studio Buds review that includes a more in-depth look at the features. Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise cancellation along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. Their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices. Read my full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review to learn more about the Android-enabled earbuds. JBL Tour Pro 2: JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds have received a lot of attention for bringing something new to true wireless earbuds: a full color touchscreen display embedded in the case that allows you to access the earbuds' key features and control playback as well as adjust volume levels. It's a bit of a gimmick but also useful. While the buds could sound slightly better for their list price, overall the JBL Tour Pro 2s are very good earbuds that offer a good fit, a robust feature set, strong battery life, plus solid noise cancellation and voice-calling performance. I took a closer look at the earbuds in my full JBL Tour Pro 2 review in 2023. Sony LinkBuds S: Unlike the "open" LinkBuds, the LinkBuds S are traditional noise-isolating true wireless earbuds with tips that jam in your ears. They're more compact and lighter than Sony's former flagship WF-1000XM4 and also feature Sony's V1 processor (Sony has since released the more compact WF-1000XM5). While their sound and noise cancellation don't quite measure up to either XM4 or XM5's, they're still quite good. They're the Sony buds for people who can't afford Sony's flagship earbuds but want 80% of those buds' features and performance for significantly less. Read more about them in our hands-on review of the Sony LinkBuds S. Sony WF-1000XM4: Released in 2021, Sony's WF-1000XM4 earned a CNET Editors' Choice Award. They're still excellent earbuds, but Sony has now released the next-gen WF-1000XM5. They may be a good option if you find them at a good discount. If you're interested in the model, I took a closer look in my full Sony WF-1000XM4 review. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3: The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 were among the best new true wireless earbuds of 2022. They're still among the best truly wireless earbuds, but Sennheiser has released the upgraded Momentum True Wireless 4. Also, the newer AirPods Pro 2 and Sony WF-1000XM5 buds are arguably superior, so only look to buy the Momentum True Wireless 3 when they're significantly discounted. Learn more about the impressive buds in my full Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 review. Beyerdynamic Free Byrd: Beyerdynamic may be late to the game, but it's finally introduced its first true wireless earbuds, which feature active noise cancellation, up to 11 hours of battery life (with noise cancelling off) and impressive sound quality. Read our Beyerdynamic Free Byrd review.Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX: Bang & Olufsen's $399 Beoplay EX buds are the company's best true wireless earbuds. They feature a comfortable, secure fit (except perhaps for those with really smaller ears), top-notch build quality, great sound, good noise cancellation and improved voice-calling performance over B&O's EQ buds, with three microphones in each earbud they help with reducing background noise while picking up your voice. They're out of most people's price range, but they're arguably the best earbuds out there with stems and offer slightly superior sound to the AirPods Pro 2 with better clarity, deeper more powerful bass and richer, more accurate sound. Learn more about the premium model in my full Bang & Olufsen Beoplay EX review. Sony Linkbuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the Linkbuds S noise-isolating earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about. Check out our Sony Linkbuds reviewfor more information on the Sony buds. Wireless earbuds FAQ
What's the difference between "wireless" and "true wireless" earbuds?
Before 2015, wireless earbuds had a cord between the buds. Still, they were called "wireless earbuds" because they offered wireless Bluetooth streaming and didn't have a headphone cable that plugged into your device. Some companies still make those types of wireless earbuds -- the Beats Flex is one example -- and some people like having a cord that allows the buds to dangle from your neck when not in use.True wireless earbuds, like the AirPods, have no cord between them. They are entirely cord-free and link wirelessly to create a stereo pair. They are sometimes referred to by the acronym TWS, which stands for true wireless stereo. Today, the two terms are largely interchangeable, and you'll find that most companies (and users) refer to all wireless earbuds as just that -- wireless earbuds.

Should I buy wired earbuds or wireless earbuds?
At the end of the day, it comes down to which model is best suited for your usage. Generally, wireless earbuds are the better option for those who need on-the-go listening. When you're working out or running, going totally wireless is liberating. Newer phones often don't have a headphone jack, so you'll need to go wireless to listen from your phone -- unless you get Lightning or USB-C earbuds or use an adapter.Still, wired models make more sense for folks who are generally more tethered and value the best sound quality possible. Wired earbuds generally offer better sound quality as their higher bandwidth allows for uncompressed, lossless audio. That said, most people won't notice a difference in most situations. If being "with the times" is a concern of yours, many Gen Zers have taken to making the "humble" wired headphones cool again, particularly Apple EarPods.So, if you prioritize convenience and quick connections from multiple devices, true wireless earbuds work well. But if sound quality is your primary concern, wired earbuds are generally superior.

What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds?
For true wireless earbuds, a "good" battery life typically means anywhere from 5-8 hours of continuous playback on a single charge, with the charging case providing an additional 15-30 hours of total battery life. Premium models often push the upper limits of this range (8-10 hours per charge), while budget options may deliver just 4-5 hours. Keep in mind that features like active noise cancellation (ANC) can reduce your listening time by 20-30%. For all-day listening, look for earbuds that offer quick charge capabilities (e.g., 5 minutes of charging for 1 hour of playback) and wireless charging cases.

Are wireless earbuds better than on-ear or over-ear headphones?
They each have their pros and cons, and it largely comes down to a matter of preference and which style of headphones you like to wear. Some people simply don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears and prefer over-ear headphones (over-ear headphones tend to be more comfortable than on-ear headphones). However, true wireless earbuds are much more compact than full-size headphones and can be carried in a pocket, making them ideal for on-the-go listening or activities like exercising and commuting to work (on the flip side, they're easier to lose). Technically, true-wireless earbuds also tend to be more durable since they have dust- and water-resistance ratings (IP ratings) that are missing from most over-ear headphones. That said, over-ear headphones offer much better battery life on a single charge and can be more comfortable to wear over longer periods, which makes them better suited for work use.As far as cost goes, you can find relatively inexpensive earbuds and full-size headphones, but there are certainly more budget earbuds to choose from. Premium earbuds and over-ear headphones can cost upwards of $250, with certain high-end audiophile headphones costing well over $500 (there are high-end wired earbuds that also cost a lot). Overall, the top over-ear headphones tend to cost a little more than the top true-wireless earbuds. While it can get a little pricey to own multiple pairs of headphones and earbuds, many people buy a few models to swap between depending on the activity.
