Get caught up on the future of the iPhone in just a few minutes with these key clips. CNET
The most recent "awe dropping" Apple event keynote has come and gone once more, with reveals of the latest iPhones, AirPods and Apple Watches. As it turns out, many of the leaks and rumors that widely circulated before the event turned out to be fairly accurate, though there were still some surprises.  We were treated to a presentation that included new information about the AirPods Pro 3, three new Apple Watches (including an Apple Watch SE and an Apple Watch Ultra), the iPhone 17, iPhone Air and the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.
Watch this: Everything Announced at Apple's iPhone 17 Event in 7 Minutes
07:18
That's a pretty hefty slate of announcements, all things considered. But if you didn't have time to check out everything on the horizon, don't worry. Whether you were too busy to catch the livestream or you want to rewatch one of the biggest announcements from the event, Apple is uploading the keynote reveals on YouTube for everyone to see. We've organized them for you below. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Apple event highlight reel If you want a quick summary of everything announced during the Apple event, there's a 2-minute highlight reel that shows off the biggest reveals. From the AirPods Pro 3 to the iPhone 17 Pro, this is the quickest roundup of Apple's next hardware lineup.
AirPods Pro 3 The AirPods Pro is making a return after a three-year absence from Apple events. The new version of Apple's premium Bluetooth earbuds feature a host of improvements over the previous model, but retains its $250 price tag. This is the product I found most impressive during the presentation: The improved 8 hours of battery life (up from 6) and noise cancellation are must-have features, while bonuses like heart-rate sensors, workout tracking, IP57 dust and water resistance and live translation are great value adds.
Apple Watch Series 11 Apple is once more championing the Apple Watch as a lifesaving device. It makes sense, since the company is adding three new models to their smartwatch lineup -- but it's a bit tiresome, as we've all heard this song and dance before, subtly implying that your very life could be at risk if you don't pick up an Apple Watch. That said, new ways to track sleep and alert wearers of possible hypertension shouldn't be ignored. Either way, check out the Dear Apple Apple Watch segment ahead of the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 releases.
Watch this: The iPhone 17 Is Here! Watch the Announcement at the Apple iPhone 17 Event
05:56
iPhone 17 The existence of the iPhone Air means the base model of the iPhone 17 is more important than ever before: Every other iPhone in the lineup is trying to retool and reengineer Apple's iconic smartphone, but this is your classic workhorse (plus some extra bells and whistles). Check out Apple's Which iPhone 17 is right for you video here. The iPhone 17 has a redesigned camera bump, a 6.3-inch display (the iPhone 16's display was 6.1 inches large, for comparison) and a Ceramic Shield 2 layer on the screen that should make the phone more resistant to scratches and cracks. I'm most excited for ProMotion to arrive on the base model, since a 120Hz refresh rate could be a big deal when it comes to playing the best mobile games with a level of fluidity we haven't seen on a regular iPhone before.
iPhone Air Say goodbye to the iPhone Plus and hello to the iPhone Air -- this ultra-thin phone is a brand-new addition to the iPhone lineup. Featuring a 6.5-inch display and a 5.5mm width, the iPhone Air is one of the sleekest smartphones ever. If you're worried about trade-offs with internal specs, Apple attempted to mitigate those fears. The company claimed the Air is the most "power-efficient" iPhone ever, and the Adaptive Power feature included in iOS 26 should go a long way in stretching out a single charge.
iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max Apple's super premium iPhone models are making a return in the form of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. This phone features the largest battery ever put into an iPhone (Apple estimates you'll get 33 hours for the smaller Pro and 39 hours of video playback for the Pro Max), the new A19 Pro chip and significant camera upgrades -- including boosting all three rear cameras to 48 megapixels, one of which has an 8x telephoto zoom. On the flip side, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is the most expensive iPhone ever. If you want the 2TB storage model, strap in to spend $2,000.
