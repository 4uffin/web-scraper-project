CNET Debates: Is Apple's New Crossbody Strap a Great Idea or a Terrible One?
Does the crossbody strap make it more or less likely that you'll have your iPhone stolen? We have conflicting opinions.
Katie Collins Principal Writer Katie is a UK-based news reporter and features writer. Officially, she is CNET's European correspondent, covering tech policy and Big Tech in the EU and UK. Unofficially, she serves as CNET's Taylor Swift correspondent. You can also find her writing about tech for good, ethics and human rights, the climate crisis, robots, travel and digital culture. She was once described a "living synth" by London's Evening Standard for having a microchip injected into her hand.

A strap for your iPhone? Count us in (and out). Apple/Screenshot by CNET
One thing you can be sure of during an Apple event is that it will generate immense quantities of discourse among CNET's seasoned nerds -- and no, we don't always agree with one another.  Is the iPhone Air totally pointless and uncalled for, or the best design innovation since very thinly sliced bread? Both can be true, depending on whom you ask.
Watch this: Everything Announced at Apple's iPhone 17 Event in 7 Minutes
07:18
Among the many announcements on Tuesday that sparked conflicting opinions was a crossbody strap for the iPhone. After a back-and-forth in Slack, my colleague Zach McAuliffe and I have decided to put forth our respective viewpoints and allow you to be the judge. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Great idea: Katie Collins, Principal Writer Have you ever been walking down the street to meet your friend, navigating using Google Maps and texting your pal to let them know you're running late, when all of a sudden: bam! A dude on a moped has whizzed past at high speed and removed your phone from your hand before you've even had a chance to realize what's happened? In London, this style of phone theft is a daily occurrence, and while it's never happened to me personally, every time I step foot on the streets of the British capital, I'm immediately wary and vigilant. Earlier this year, The Guardian reported that survey data from US insurance company SquareTrade showed that 39% of all European phone thefts take place in the UK, and that 42% of British phone thefts occur in London. So common is it for your phone to be snatched by someone on a bike or moped that London's Metropolitan Police issue special prevention guidance, featuring advice such as: "[when using your phone] stand away from the roadside, close to a building or wall, so no one can come up behind you." I get that a crossbody is not a failsafe method to prevent iPhone theft. I would never advise someone to walk around a city in a state of blissful ignorance while their phone flaps hands-free against their body. But I do endorse it as a way to fend off opportunists on two wheels. I can see other times the crossbody strap would come in handy, too. Frequently on my travels, I find myself on a boat, clutching the railing and taking pictures on my phone as the world passes me by. Always in these situations I'm concerned that just one clumsy slip could see my precious phone go the way of the Heart of the Ocean in Titanic. A crossbody strap would provide peace of mind in such moments to protect me against my own idiocy. As a clumsy person who dreads having their phone stolen, I will be investing in one of Apple's crossbody iPhone straps the moment they become available. I personally can only see the benefit in having my phone glued to my body as well as my hand.
Terrible idea: Zach McAuliffe, Staff Writer When I saw Apple's new crossbody strap for the iPhone, my first thought was, "I bet someone could cut that real easy and steal someone's iPhone." But surely Apple thought of that and chose a cut-resistant strap made with something like Dyneema, right? Nope. According to Apple, the strap is made of recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) yarns. It's a synthetic fiber made from recycled plastic bottles.  If you had a razor or something similarly sharp, you could cut through the strap like a hot knife through butter. Then there's nothing stopping you from taking the iPhone. The decision to dangle a thousand-dollar device off a strip of non-cut-resistant plastic gives me so much anxiety. Some people on Reddit said they've had their crossbody bags and purses stolen because someone cut the straps and ran or rode off, so it does happen. Granted, so does someone snatching a phone from your hand. But if I'm wearing my iPhone as a bag, I'm advertising that I have an iPhone and all you have to do is follow me for a second in order to cut the straps and take off with it. Plus, if my iPhone is tethered to me by a strap, I might be more cavalier with how I handle it. The strap and corresponding case are meant to keep the device safe, so I might take for granted things that could damage it out in the world. What if a car kicks a rock up and hits it, or I bump into a metal railing a little too hard or any number of things happen and my iPhone gets a new scratch or breaks?  No, I'd much rather grip my iPhone like my life depends on it when the device is in my hand. And then I'll slip my iPhone into my pocket for safe keeping like Bilbo Baggins after he finds the One Ring. The crossbody strap is a bad idea. I know people have things taken all the time, but the strap is like wearing a sign around your neck that you have an iPhone and with a quick snip it could be yours! Hopefully, Apple will make a cut-resistant strap in the future. For more from Apple's event, check out all the announcements and our hands-on with the ultra-thin iPhone Air.
