Apple's Super-Slim iPhone Air Had Me on Edge... Until I Tested It
Review: My concerns about the durability of Apple's thinnest iPhone were put to rest when I got my hands on it. And despite a scaled-back camera and slimmer battery, there's a lot to love.

How we test phones
I fell in love with Apple's sleek, lightweight iPhone Air the moment I first held it. Now, after using the wildly thin device for a week, my worries about durability and battery life have mostly melted away -- though at times, I'm still reminded that love can be complicated.The $999 (£999, AU$1,799) iPhone Air, which replaces Apple's iPhone Plus models, is just 5.6mm thick and weighs only 165 grams, making it striking to hold -- and behold. The iPhone 17, for comparison, is 7.95mm thick and weighs 177 grams. And yes, they feel drastically different in my hand.The Air's 6.5-inch display sits right between the size of the baseline iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the phone's smooth, curved edges help to give it a premium feel. The Air is a worthy competitor to Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge, which is 5.8mm thick and weighs 163 grams (and which I've also reviewed). It also joins the ranks of other thin devices from Chinese companies like Huawei, Oppo and Honor.

But slimming down also means scaling back in some regards. In my time so far with the iPhone Air, the battery took a noticeable hit on heavy-use days, though it held up surprisingly well under more moderate use and in CNET's battery tests (more on that below). The pared-back camera hardware was also something to contend with, since the iPhone Air has just one rear 48-megapixel wide-angle camera. I really missed having a separate ultrawide camera for landscapes, and I'm also bummed that the Air can't shoot Cinematic mode videos.And yet, despite those grievances, the iPhone Air truly does feel like a breath of fresh air. Its innovative design proves Apple can deliver more than just incremental upgrades across its iPhone lineup. iPhone Air build and durability: Will it bend?
The iPhone Air has a titanium frame to help with durability.  Celso Bulgatti/Zooey Liao/CNETThe iPhone Air has a titanium frame to keep it lightweight and durable (unlike the other models in the iPhone 17 series, which feature an aluminum body). Its Ceramic Shield 2 display is three times better at resisting scratches, according to Apple, while the Ceramic Shield on the back is four times more resistant to cracks. So far, I'm happy to report no scuffs or scratches on the front or back of my device, and I've boldly been going caseless for the purposes of "science." Despite the iPhone Air's thinness, it doesn't budge when I try to bend it in my hand, or when it's in my back pocket. During a demonstration at Apple Park following the company's fall keynote, I watched with suspense as a machine applied more than 130 pounds of force to the middle of the iPhone Air, and it still came out unscathed. So that should offer some assurance that it hopefully won't fold in your pocket.The iPhone Air has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, which I may or may not have tested when shooting the accompanying video for this review by dropping it in a fountain. Thankfully, it was unharmed (apart from some minor scuffs on the corners from scraping across the stone floor). If, like me, you're someone who typically chooses to protect your pricey tech investments with a case, Apple has a clear MagSafe one that's less than 1mm thick, so it doesn't take away from the Air's overall slimness. It has the added advantage of evening out the protruding camera bump, eliminating the slight wobble when you set the phone down on a flat surface without a case. There's one design element that's a bit of a letdown, especially if you spend as much time binging YouTube and TikTok videos on your phone as I do. The iPhone Air doesn't have a speaker on the bottom, only one at the top of the phone. That means the listening experience isn't as immersive, and music doesn't sound as good as it would on an iPhone with multiple speakers. It's not a deal-breaker, but for a nearly $1,000 phone, I'd expect a little more without having to resort to AirPods Pro 3 or other headphones for better audio.On the other hand, I'm thrilled Apple has finally brought 120Hz displays to its entire new lineup, instead of just the Pro models. That means I can enable the always-on display on the Air to quickly glance at the time and my notifications, and the display will dim and refresh at a very low rate to preserve power. Conversely, the screen can crank up to a higher rate when I'm scrolling through websites or playing games, creating smoother animations that look more natural. An anti-reflective coating and a 3,000-nit peak brightness make it easier to see the phone's screen outdoors, too. The iPhone Air comes in space black, cloud white, light gold and sky blue. I reviewed the sky blue version, which is my favorite of the hues. It's a very subtle blue that almost looks white, and it adds to the phone's sleek, futuristic appearance. You can choose from three storage options: 256GB, 512GB or 1TB. (I have the 1TB option.) It's a nice perk to not have to scale back on storage with a slimmer device.iPhone Air camera: I miss you 0.5x
The iPhone Air has a single, 48-megapixel wide-angle camera. Jesse Orrall/Zooey Liao/CNETThere's just one rear camera on the iPhone Air, a 48-megapixel wide-angle, which can also take solid 2x zoom photos that rival those shot on a telephoto lens (like its siblings, these crop-zoomed images are taken at a 12-megapixel resolution). Photos default to 24 megapixels, but you can quickly change the settings in the Camera app to snap images at that full 48 megapixels for more detail. It felt surprisingly limiting to not have an ultrawide camera, especially when I wanted to capture more sweeping landscapes. Not to turn this into a thin phone showdown, but I couldn't help but think of how the Galaxy S25 Edge does have a 12-megapixel ultrawide-angle camera, alongside a 200-megapixel wide-angle camera, which makes it feel like less of a compromise in that regard. Otherwise, the rear camera on the iPhone Air consistently delivered. In the many pictures I took of waterfalls, tea times and urban landscapes, shadows and highlights are well balanced, colors are true to life, and there's an overall sharpness and clarity. Portrait shots (my go-to camera mode) capably blur backgrounds to help subjects stand out, whether it's a decadent tea tray, an art installation or CNET's talented video producer Jesse Orrall.
No camera test is complete without a teatime photoshoot.  Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
Portrait mode can help elevate the shot. The Air did a good job knowing how much to blur and keep in focus, which must have been tricky with so many layers of tea time goodies.  Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
Here's a 2x portrait mode photo of CNET's Senior Video Producer Jesse Orrall. The foreground is in crisp focus, and the blurred background gives this a more professional look. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
And here's a 2x portrait photo of Jesse using the new (aptly-named) Bright photographic style. I prefer the warmth of the standard style above, and how that one is more true-to-life. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
2x portrait images are among my favorite for their dramatic effect. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
This image was taken using night mode just after the sun disappeared, but the iPhone Air brightened it up so you can hardly tell it was dark out.  Abrar Al-Heeti/CNETThe absence of a separate telephoto camera didn't feel particularly restricting, since I'm used to the non-Pro iPhones not having one. (Not every phone can be the Pixel 10, I suppose.) And the 2x zoom photos on the Air were sharp and clean enough to satisfy me.
This was taken at 1x zoom. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNET
And here, I punched in to 2x zoom. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNETThe iPhone Air also has a Camera Control button on the side to quickly snap photos and launch Visual Intelligence to learn more about what's around you via the camera. The button is admittedly a little tricky to feel because it's also so thin, but I'm glad it's there, since that's become my go-to way to open the camera on newer iPhones. (And if you'd rather turn it off, you can do that.) An 18-megapixel selfie camera on the Air utilizes a new feature for iPhones called Center Stage, which already exists on iPads and Macs. This will automatically (or manually, if you prefer) switch your shot from a portrait orientation to a landscape one as more people come into the frame, without you having to rotate your phone. People's eyes will also look more centered as a result, since they're not looking so far away from the lens. Center Stage also helps to stabilize people's faces on FaceTime and other video calls and keep them in frame.
Center Stage automatically turned this into a landscape photo when Patrick and Alexandra came into the frame. Abrar Al-Heeti/CNETA Dual Capture mode lets you shoot with both the front and back cameras simultaneously. I plan to use this feature extensively at an upcoming Jonas Brothers concert to capture my jubilation along with what's happening onstage. Chaos will surely ensue.

A post shared by CNET (@cnet)
As hard as it is to live without an ultrawide camera, perhaps the biggest camera-related blow for me is the iPhone Air's lack of support for Cinematic videos. I use Cinematic mode extensively for dramatic shots when I need a blurred background, so its absence is yet another reminder of the shortcomings of having just one rear camera. iPhone Air battery life: Will it last all day?
The iPhone Air (mostly) survived my unhinged screen time.  Jesse Orrall/ Zooey Liao/ CNETApple doesn't share specific battery specs for its phones, but it notes the iPhone Air has all-day battery life and up to 27 hours of video playback. According to Apple, the internal design maximizes space for the battery, and the A19 Pro Chip and power management with iOS 26 help give it a boost, too. Specifically, a feature called Adaptive Power mode helps extend battery life by automatically adjusting your iPhone's performance based on how you're using it at that moment. That could mean reducing the display's brightness, scaling back on CPU speeds, turning off some background activities, or activating low power mode. The catch is that Adaptive Power takes about a week to kick in and understand your usage, so I haven't had a chance to see it in action yet. But I'm very eager to see how it affects the iPhone Air's battery life.  My experience with the Air's battery so far has been varied, and, not surprisingly, depends on how heavy my phone usage is that day. On a Friday packed with my usual workday activities of sending endless emails and Slack messages, texting, using my mobile hotspot on the train, snapping photos and videos (in part for this review), streaming music, calling an Uber and unwinding on TikTok and YouTube, the battery went from 100% at 7:45 a.m. to dead by 7:26 p.m. That early experience made me fearful that the iPhone Air's battery just wasn't cut out for the job. But on a slower Saturday where I spent less time staring at a phone screen and more time cleaning my apartment, watching some TV and, well, writing this review, I did in fact get that all-day battery life that Apple promises. The Air started with a full battery at 9:20 a.m. and finished the day with 20% to spare by 12:01 a.m. -- despite me still spending a significant chunk of time scrolling through TikTok and Instagram, watching YouTube videos, ordering DoorDash, texting, streaming music and uploading photos and videos to Google Drive. I was unlocking and using my phone less frequently and using it in smaller bursts, and I was on Wi-Fi all day, but I wasn't holding back from my normal activities. Since then, the battery has been similarly more enduring, even as I go about my day.Apple seems to have anticipated trepidation surrounding the iPhone Air's slimmer battery, as it also introduced a $99 MagSafe battery designed specifically for the Air, which it says can extend video playback to up to 40 hours. In fact, Apple's website has two sets of listings for the iPhone Air's battery: one for the phone, and another with the MagSafe battery, as if it's truly a component of the device itself.The battery pack has a nice matte finish and doesn't protrude too far beyond the phone's rear camera bump, but attaching anything to a slim phone kind of defeats the purpose if you have to do it often enough. I'm hoping it'll remain more of a failsafe option when I need a little extra juice, as opposed to a necessity for carrying on with my day. In CNET's 45-minute endurance test, which includes streaming, scrolling through social media, joining a video call and playing games, the iPhone Air's battery went from full to 95%, which was pleasantly surprising. This aligns with results from other phones like the Oppo's Find N5, Google's Pixel 9A and Motorola's 2025 Razr Ultra. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge's battery went from full to 91% in the same test. In a 3-hour streaming test over Wi-Fi, in which I watched a YouTube video in full-screen mode at full brightness (and at 1080p), the iPhone Air's battery dropped from 100% to 85%. That beats the Galaxy S25 Edge, which hit 83% in the same test.The iPhone Air charges at up to 20 watts, which isn't just slow compared with other phones (like the 100-watt-charging OnePlus 13) but within the iPhone 17 lineup as well, as the other phones can charge up to 40 watts. In a 30-minute charging test, the iPhone Air reached 54%. It took about an hour and a half to hit 100%. It also supports Qi2 wireless charging up to 20 watts.iOS 26 features and Liquid Glass
iOS 26 adds more customization options for the lock screen. Jesse Orrall/CNETLike the rest of Apple's latest iPhone lineup, the iPhone Air comes out of the box with iOS 26 on board. This features Apple's new "Liquid Glass" interface that brings a more see-through, lens-like look to the iPhone and other Apple devices. It admittedly took a bit of adjustment to get used to the clearer design elements, but it's surprisingly satisfying to type in my passcode and watch the numbers bubble up and magnify that portion of the screen, and to see how translucent controls allow content to stretch across more of the display. You can also customize app icons to be clear, but that felt like a little too much clarity for me.You can jazz up your group iMessage chats with fun backgrounds or start a poll so you don't have to decipher where the winning location is for dinner, for instance. Perhaps my favorite new iMessage feature is being able to filter texts from unknown numbers and have them sent to a separate list aptly named "Unknown Senders." (So long, job recruitment scammers!)A couple of new features can help phone calls feel less daunting, especially if you're as averse to them as I am. Call Screening will automatically answer calls from unknown numbers and ask why they're trying to reach you. You'll see a transcription of that response so you can choose whether or not to accept the call. If you'd rather not deal with unknown numbers at all, you can also choose to have them silenced and sent to voicemail (a huge win for fellow introverts). And when you're waiting to talk to a live agent, Hold Assist can save your place in line -- so you don't have to listen to mind-numbing hold music -- and notify you when it's finally your turn to chat. These features are similar to ones that have been on Google's Pixel phones for years, but it's nice to see them finally arrive on the iPhone.Live Translation automatically translates what someone is saying across Phone and FaceTime calls, as well as Messages. Just note there is a slight lag when talking to someone on the phone as the automated voice translates what's being said. (Google has a similar feature on Pixel phones, though that version can actually mimic the sound of someone's voice using AI.)Visual intelligence can now understand what's on your screen and search for relevant information online. After taking a screenshot, tap the "Ask" button in the lower left corner to learn more about what you're looking at, with the help of ChatGPT. But another visual intelligence feature has proven to be more handy to me, largely because it mirrors Google's incredibly convenient Circle to Search capability. After taking a screenshot, trace around a product or object you want to learn more about, and then you'll see relevant search results from platforms like Google, Etsy and Poshmark. Final thoughts: Is the iPhone Air right for you?
The iPhone Air is great if you're looking for something light in your hand or pocket. Jesse Orrall/ Zooey Liao/ CNETAmid the current thin phone craze, there's a glaring question: What's the point of a skinnier device? And how much do you have to compromise to have a phone that's lighter in your hand and slimmer in your pocket?Understanding the appeal of a thin phone like the iPhone Air may require a bit of reframing. It's easy to think of it merely as a less capable iPhone, especially when compared with Apple's higher-end Pro models. But form factor is king here. The iPhone Air isn't about having top-level cameras; that's what the Pro models are for. It's also not about packing the largest battery. In an ideal world, it would be great to have the most advanced specs crammed into the slimmest device. But we're just not there yet. Phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and the iPhone Air scale back a bit when it comes to battery life and cameras (the former more so with the S25 Edge and the latter more so with the iPhone Air). But that may not be an issue for someone who isn't as heavy a user and doesn't spend as much time staring at a screen. The Air can also be an enticing choice for anyone who's bored with devices that all look the same. Like foldables, thin phones offer a fresh look and feel that's more exciting than the incremental upgrades we've grown accustomed to. (In fact, it's possible the iPhone Air serves as somewhat of a stepping stone as Apple reportedly prepares to debut a foldable iPhone next year.) But if you're OK with the same old same old and would rather save some cash, the $829 baseline iPhone 17 (or $799 if you activate with a carrier) could be a good alternative, since it shares many of the same features as the iPhone Air -- plus it comes with two rear cameras and stereo speakers.So, where do I stand with the iPhone Air after using it for a week? I'm still just as in love with that sleek profile as I was on day one, and it's now an adjustment to use any other non-slim phone. I've mostly made peace with the battery life, especially given how it performed in CNET's endurance and streaming tests. I look forward to seeing how the phone's life extends even more once Adaptive Power mode kicks in.Having only one rear lens has admittedly felt like a setback, even with how well that 48-megapixel camera captures images. Not having the flexibility of an ultrawide camera can feel limiting at times, especially from a phone that's nearly $1,000. The lack of a second speaker for a more balanced sound is also disappointing, given the sticker price. Ultimately, the iPhone Air is a first-generation device, which means there's certainly going to be room for improvement. But if you're willing to make some compromises, it can be a refreshing choice. iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. iPhone 17 vs. iPhone 17 Pro vs. iPhone 17 Pro Max undefined Apple iPhone AirSamsung Galaxy S25 EdgeApple iPhone 17Apple iPhone 17 ProApple iPhone 17 Pro Max Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate 6.5-inch OLED; 2,736 x 1,260 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate6.7-inch QHD+  AMOLED display; 120Hz refresh rate 6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate6.3-inch OLED; 2,622 x 1,206 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz variable refresh rate6.9-inch OLED; 2,868 x 1,320 pixel resolution; 1-120Hz variable refresh ratePixel density 460ppi513ppi460ppi460ppi460ppiDimensions (inches) 6.15 x 2.94 x 0.22 in2.98 x 6.23 x 0.23 inches5.89 x 2.81 x 0.31 in5.91 x 2.83 x 0.34 in6.43 x 3.07 x 0.34 inDimensions (millimeters) 156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64 mm75.6 X 158.2 X 5.8mm149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95 mm150.0 x 71.9 x 8.75 mm163.4 x 78.0 x 8.75 mmWeight (grams, ounces) 165 g (5.82 oz)163g (5.75 oz)177 g (6.24 oz)206 g (7.27 oz)233 g (8.22 oz)Mobile software iOS 26Android 15iOS 26iOS 26iOS 26Camera 48-megapixel (wide)200-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide)48-megapixel (wide) 48-megapixel (ultrawide)48-megapixel (wide) 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 48-megapixel (4x, 8x telephoto)48-megapixel (wide) 48-megapixel (ultrawide) 48-megapixel (4x, 8x telephoto)Front-facing camera 18-megapixel12-megapixel18-megapixel18-megapixel18-megapixelVideo capture 4K8K4K4K4KProcessor Apple A19 ProSnapdragon 8 EliteApple A19Apple A19 ProApple A19 ProRAM + storage RAM N/A + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GBRAM N/A + 256GB, 512GBRAM N/A + 256GB, 512GB, 1TBRAM N/A + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TBExpandable storage NoneNoNoneNoneNoneBattery Up to 27 hours video playback; up to 22 hours video playback (streamed).

How we test phonesEvery phone CNET's reviews team tests is used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.All the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions, from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode, and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily, as well as running a series of battery drain tests.We take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.
