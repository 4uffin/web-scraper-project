What are the best noise-canceling headphones overall? Though the recently released Sony WH-1000XM6 list for $450 -- or $50 more than the highly rated XM5 -- they're arguably the best noise-canceling headphones right now and have earned a CNET Editors' Choice award. Other high-end over-ear contenders include the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, Apple AirPods Max and Sonos Ace, while the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen), Sony WF-1000XM5 and Apple AirPods Pro 2 stand out from the pack as great options for the best noise-canceling earbuds. I've also included some budget picks, like the QCY H3 Pro and Earfun Wave Pro, for people looking for much more affordable noise-canceling headphones that deliver good bang for the buck.What We Updated: August 2025We added the Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANC and removed the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds because Bose has released the upgraded QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2, which are due to hit stores in the U.S. sometime in August.Best noise-canceling headphones of 2025

Over the last several years, Sony has made some of the best noise-canceling headphones on the market, so it's a big deal when the company comes out with a new flagship model, like the WH-1000XM6, which arrives three years after the release of the WH-1000XM5. Though the XM5 was -- and still is -- one of the top over-ear Bluetooth headphones, there's always room for improvement. With the XM6, Sony has fixed the small design flaws of its predecessor while bumping up the overall performance. The result is a headphone that's arguably edged just ahead of the competition and is now at the top of its class. Read my WH-1000XM6 review.Reasons to buyThe WH-1000XM6 are excellent for frequent travelers, remote workers and commuters who demand top-tier sound quality, noise canceling and call quality in a very comfortable headphone. If you can afford the high price, you'll appreciate what Sony has achieved here.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you're budget-conscious or already own Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones, you should hold off until they go on sale. They offer some significant improvements over the XM5s, but not enough to justify rushing to upgrade at full price.  ... Show more

Best designed new noise-canceling headphones
Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Eye-catching, premium design is made out of premium material and is slightly slimmer and lighter
Upgraded ear pads for more comfortable fit
Upgraded biocellulose drive units powered by discrete amplifier improves the sound quality
Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with 8 microphones
USB-C audio for lossless wired connection
Cons
Premium price ($50 more expensive than PX7 S2)
Noise canceling isn't quite up to the level of Sony's and Bose's
Headphones fold flat but not up (no dual-hinge)
At default setting, treble may be a touch too aggressive (forward) for some folks
Why I like themBowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 technically aren't the company's flagship headphones (the PX8 are), but they're arguably better than the more expensive PX8s, offering improved sound quality and superior noise canceling in an upgraded, slimmer design (300 grams) that fit my head more comfortably. The drivers aren't the same as the PX8's carbon cone drivers, but the redesigned 40mm biocellulose drive units have an improved chassis, voice coil, suspension and magnet that, according to B&W, deliver "lower coloration and distortion, improved resolution and superior dynamics." Additionally, for the first time in a pair of B&W headphones, the drive units are powered by a dedicated, discrete headphone amplifier that provides more "scale and energy to the sound." I did think their sound was more revealing and open compared to the earlier S2e, and they are more exciting and fun to listen to. At the default setting, the treble may be a touch aggressive for some folks (a tad too much sizzle), which can lead to some listening fatigue. But you can play around with the five-band equalizer in the companion app for iOS and Android to smooth things out and give the headphones a slightly warmer sound.While they are pricey, at least they look like premium headphones and are made with premium materials. In my tests in the noisy streets of New York, I found that the noise canceling is significantly improved (it's better than PX8's), though it's not quite up to the level of what you get with Sony's and Bose's flagship noise canceling headphones. I also thought the voice-calling performance has been upgraded (the headphones have eight microphones total, four in each ear cup).While callers said that the background noise reduction wasn't quite as good as what they heard when I was talking to them on Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, they said they could hear my voice well with minimal background noise.It's also worth noting that these headphones have USB-C audio for a lossless wired connection (and they also come with a 3.5mm analog cable that stows away nicely in a compartment inside the headphone's hard case). Android users should note that they have support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless audio codecs that can help improve sound quality when listening wirelessly over Bluetooth to high-resolution tracks from music streaming services like Tidal, Amazon and Qobuz. However, very few mainstream Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive or Lossless (more support Sony's LDAC audio codec).Reasons to buyThe sleekly designed, swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 are excellent noise-canceling headphones that are a clear improvement over their predecessor. That said, the biggest reason to buy these over Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, which carry the same list price, is that you like their look better. They also feature USB-C audio, while the XM6 don't.Reason to skip/keep lookingFrom an aesthetic standpoint, I prefer the design of the PX7 S3 to the Sony WH-1000XM6. But I can't say the PX7 S3 are any more comfortable or sound better (I slightly preferred the sound of the Sony, in fact). The Sonys offer slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance, along with some extra features such as Speak-to-Chat and Quick Attention mode. If you already own the earlier PX7 S2e, it's probably not worth shelling out full price for PX7 S3. The same is true if you own Bowers & Wilkins' flagship PX8, which could get the S2 treatment in 2025. The PX7 S3 sounds more exciting than the PX8, but it's debatable whether it sounds better. I would give the slight nod to the PX8 but that's just my personal taste.  ... Show more

Pros

Lightweight and very comfortable
Excellent sound and great noise canceling
Voice-calling performance is top-notch

Cons
Higher price than the previous model

Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life
Why I like themBose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones feature a more premium design than their predecessor, along with Bose's Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also great for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. Released in late 2023, I called these "a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max headphones." Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones have edged slightly ahead of the QC Ultras, but they remain one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market. Read my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review.Reasons to buyThey're a good choice for frequent travelers, commuters and professionals who want comfortable, well-designed headphones with impressive overall performance, including excellent noise-muffling capabilities.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThose who are on a tighter budget should obviously look toward more midrange and budget headphones options. Also, Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones are arguably slightly better for around the same price. That said, since the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones came out in late 2023, they do end up going on sale fairly regularly.  ... Show more

Top noise-canceling headphones from Sonos
Sonos' answer to Apple's AirPods Max
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Well-designed and comfortable headband that cups head for a good acoustic seal
Excellent sound and noise-canceling to reduce ambient noise by about 85%-95%
Strong voice-calling performance
Spatial audio with head-tracking
USB-C audio for digital lossless wired connection
TV Audio Swap feature for Sonos users
Cons
Pricey
Not Wi-Fi headphones, despite expectations
TV Audio Swap feature only works with Sonos' Arc sound bar at launch (and can be glitchy)
Why I like themA lot of people expected Sonos' first headphones to be able to stream lossless audio over Wi-Fi in your home and then use Bluetooth outside your Sonos home network. However, Sonos reps told me that listening to music over Wi-Fi would greatly reduce the headphone's battery life and the company opted to leave that feature off. So even though they're equipped with a Wi-Fi chip so you can tap into a Sonos sound bar at home for private late-night viewing (Sonos refers to this as the TV Audio Swap feature), they're not really Wi-Fi headphones and are first and foremost noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones -- and I was mostly quite impressed by them. Read my Sonos Ace review.Sleekly designed, at 312 grams, they're not as light as the 254-gram Sony WH-1000XM6s or the 253-gram Bose QuietComfort Ultras, but they're considerably lighter than the 385-gram AirPods Max and I found them quite comfortable to wear, with a relatively small gap between the headband and my head (they hugged my head nicely with just the right amount of clamping). I also appreciated tat their chrome metal yoke allows the headphones to swivel in multiple directions -- the hinge is hidden - and the ear cups adhere magnetically like they do on the AirPods Max and are replaceable, which is good.All in all, the Sonos Ace headphones perform very well across the board with strong noise canceling, excellent sound quality and very good voice-calling performance. Well balanced, they're clean sounding with nice detail and sparkle in the treble along with punchy, powerful bass that doesn't get boomy. Vocals sounded natural and the headphones have a relatively wide soundstage. It's also good to see that the headphones have USB-C audio support (wired listening with a USB-C cable) and spatial audio with head-tracking.Reasons to buyThe Sonos Ace are one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market, rivaling flagship models from Sony, Apple and Bose. Now that they've been out for more than a year, we're seeing some good discounts on them, which makes them a better value, and a potential alternative to Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones. While you don't have to be an owner of Sonos speakers to buy them, Sonos soundbar owners can leverage the TV Audio Swap feature for private late-night viewing (the Ace delivers virtual surround sound in this mode).Reasons to skip/keep lookingYou can make the argument that Sony's new WH-1000XM6 are slightly better overall for around the same price (I'm talking list price -- and yes, they're too pricey for some folks). But with the Ace selling for as low as $330, they're an easier sell.  ... Show more

Top budget noise-canceling headphones
QCY H3 Pro
Pros
Sound quite good for their relatively low price
Lightweight and relatively comfortable
Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance for a budget headphone
USB-C audio (and wired mode with included cable)
Support for LDAC audio codec
Cons
ANC cuts off in wired mode
No carry case or pouch included
Why I Like ThemQCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads.The sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all, the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones.You do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. The H3 Pro are decent value for the cost, particularly when their price dips closer to $50.Reasons to buyLike the handful of other budget headphones I recommend, the QCY H3 Pro are better than you'd think they'd be for their modest price in terms of both design and performance.Reasons to skip/ keep lookingIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones occasionally distort audio and lack the treble clarity found in higher-end models. Also, it's too bad they don't come with any sort of carrying pouch and noise cancelling isn't available when using the cable for wired listening (you'd kind of want noise canceling if you watching a movie on a plane plugged into your seat's inflight entertainment system).  ...

Best noise-canceling headphones from Skullcandy
Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANC
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Relatively lightweight and comfortable
Not only fold flat but fold up into a nicely designed crossbody travel bag
Very good sound after tweaking EQ settings
Well-designed physical controls
Good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
THX spatial audio with head tracking
Strong battery life (up to 50 hours with ANC on)
Cons
No USB-C audio
Fairly pricey
No support for LDAC and AptX audio codecs (AAC and SBC only)
Why I like themWe reviewed Skullcandy's wired Aviator Roc Nation headphones all the way back in 2011. Now Skullcandy's brought the Aviator design back in a wireless noise-canceling model called the Aviator 900 ANC headphones. They kind of surprised me because Skullcandy is better known for its Crusher headphones, which deliver bone-rattling bass but not so-called premium-sounding headphones. However, the Aviator 900, developed in partnership with THX, deliver surprisingly impressive sound. They're not so great out of the box, but after you make some tweaks to the EQ in the app and turn on the THX spatial audio, the sound improves dramatically and is arguably more exciting than the new Nothing Headphone (1)'s sound and more fun to listen to.Like the Nothing Headphones (1), the Aviator 900 ANC also list for $300 and have a translucent theme. However, the Aviator 900 is lighter (289 grams) and more comfortable to wear. Plus, it not only folds flat but folds up into a well-designed crossbody travel bag (you can remove the strap) and has some nifty physical control buttons (I also liked the integrated mini LED display, though it's value is dubious because you can't see it while you have the headphones on). It, too, features good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance, though the Nothing Headphone (1) may have a slight edge in those departments. Even so, I slightly preferred Skullcandy headphones for their fit and sound, especially after a firmware upgrade fixed an early issue that some people experienced with the sound distorting at higher volumes.Reasons to buyThe Aviator 900 ANC headphones offer a comfortable fit and strong overall performance in a unique, eye-catching design. They also seem to regularly go on sale for $200, which makes them significantly more affordable than the Sony WH-1000XM6 and other premium noise-canceling headphones.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe headphones are fairly pricey, so you may want to wait for them to go on sale. They've dipped to as low as $200 during Amazon Prime Day, and I suspect we'll see them sporadically discounted to near $200 as we head into the holiday buying season.  ... Show more

Best high-end wireless headphones for Apple users
Apple AirPods Max
8.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Surprisingly comfortable for their weight
Impressive sound and build-quality
Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode
Good headset performance for calls
Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a sweet bonus feature
Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)
Cons
Expensive, heavy and the smart case may be too smart for its own good
No cable included for wired use
Android users lose a couple of key features
People around you can hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up (they leak some sound)
Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2
Why I like themIn late 2024, Apple updated the AirPods Max with USB-C charging -- instead of Lightning -- and added new color options but didn't upgrade the headphones in any other ways that we're aware of. Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver impressive sound quality, excellent noise canceling, very good voice-calling performance, as well as high-end build quality (aluminum ear cups and stainless steel telescoping arms) and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature with head tracking. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. It's also worth noting that Apple enabled USB-C audio for the AirPods Max in March of 2024. Read my review of the original Lightning-enabled AirPods Max.What that means is that you can use the included USB-C charging cable to connect the headphones to your USB-C-equipped PC, phone or tablet to get lossless audio (the sound quality is slightly improved with wired listening, especially if you're listening to lossless audio files). While Apple doesn't include a USB-C-to-3.5mm cable -- yes, such a cable should be included with headphones that cost this much -- it will sell you one for $39.Reasons to buyYes, they're pricey, but the AirPods Max remain top-notch noise-canceling headphones that are right there with Sony's and Bose's flagship models. Like other AirPods, they have some Apple-only only features, including spacial audio with head-tracking and automatic switching between Apple devices, that Apple users will appreciate.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile the AirPods Max were updated with USB-C connectivity, which has some advantages, they haven't been substantially upgraded since their release in 2020. I'd like to see them at least updated with Apple's more powerful H2 chip (they're equipped with the H1 chip) that delivers some additional features and is available in the AirPods Pro 2. Could we get an AirPods Max 2 in 2026? Maybe.  ... Show more

Sony's previous generation flagship ANC headphones
Sony WH-1000XM5
9.2
/10
SCORE
Why I like themSony has released its new-for-2025 WH-1000XM6 headphones, but its former flagship model, the XM5 is still an excellent headphone that's often on sale for closer to $300. Their noise-canceling, voice-calling and sound isn't quite as good as what the XM6 offers (the XM6 sounds a little more detailed with improved bass performance) and the XM6 has a dual-hinge design that allows them to fold up, not just fold flat. As a result, the XM6's case is a little smaller. Additionally, the XM6 is powered by a new QN3 chip that Sony says delivers 7 times the performance of the QN1 chip found in the XM5s. All that said, while the jump in performance from the XM5 to the XM6 is certainly noticeable, it isn't huge; the XM5 still offers very good sound, noise-canceling and voice-calling performance that should satisfy most people. Read my Sony WH-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy the XM5 is if you can't afford the XM6 and find the XM5 substantially discounted. It's still quite competitive with the Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Sonos Ace and Apple's AirPods Max.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIt's always a little hard to buy a previous-generation headphone that was released three years ago (2022) when you know a newer, better model (the XM6) exists and will eventually go on sale.  ...

Best JBL noise-canceling headphones
JBL Tour One M3 Smart Tx
Pros
Upgraded design
Very comfortable
Improved noise-canceling and sound quality
Robust feature set
Good voice-calling performance
Smart Tx audio transmitter included
Cons
Pricey
Some people may find Smart Tx audio transmitter not that useful
Why I like themJBL's new flagship noise-canceling headphones, the Tour One M3 Smart Tx, are a nice step up from the company's earlier Tour One M3. Not only are the more comfortable (they weigh 278 grams and have an upgraded ear cup design), but they feature better noise-canceling, slightly improved sound quality and good voice-calling performance. The headphones also come with an accessory that isn't included with competing premium noise-canceling models: the JBL Smart Tx audio transmitter, which enables you to wirelessly deliver audio to the Tour One M3 from any USB-C or analog audio source such as an inflight entertainment system, PC, tablet or television. It has a touchscreen LCD that allows you to control the Tour One M3's features, including music playback, call management and EQ Settings JBL says the Smart Tx -- it's rated for up to 18 hours of battery life -- also has the ability to broadcast any audio source to an unlimited amount of Auracast-enabled devices.JBL's previous two Tour One models fell a little short of Sony's and Bose's premium noise canceling offerings. But its upgraded and more refined third-generation Tour One M3 headphones are more viable alternative to those models, though they would be more enticing if they were priced closer to $300. Equipped with newly designed 40mm Mica Dome drivers, the sound is well-balanced and dynamic, with well-defined bass and some sparkle in the treble. The mids, where vocals live, could sound a tad more natural and clear, you can make some tweaks to those aforementioned EQ settings to dial in a sound profile that's optimized for your hearing and specific musical tastes. In the end, the Tour One M3 are very good noise-canceling headphones, with a robust feature set, including JBL Spatial Sound with head tracking, 8 mics (4 on and in each ear cup) and support for the LDAC audio codec for Android devices. Their only issue is that their sound and noise canceling doesn't rise above the competition in this price range. So, as I said, they probably need to cost a $50-$100 less for someone to choose them over Sony, Apple or Bose.Reasons to buyJBL's Smart Tx audio transmitter is a distinguishing feature and the headphones are nicely design and offer very good performance overall.Reasons to skip/keep lookingFrom a sound quality perspective, the Tour One M3 aren't quite as great as some other headphones in this price range, including the Sony WH-1000XM6 and Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3.  ...

SCORE
When Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds came out in 2021, we awarded them a CNET Editors' Choice. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the XM5s perfect? Not quite. And at $300 -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly too. But overall they're really impressive -- easily among the very top earbuds on the market.  ... Show more

Pros
Sturdy, eye-catching design with translucent elements
Clean, clear sound with well-defined bass that's enjoyable to listen to
Strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
Excellent controls that are intuitive to use

Nice carrying case (although some find the zipper problematic)
Cons
Headphones are a ltitle heavy and not quite as comfortable as some competing models
They fold flat but don't fold up
Sound quality is good but not a wow
The ear pads are not easily removable and it's unclear whether they're replaceable
The Nothing Headphone (1) ended up being more impressive than I thought it would be. Nothing has always been a good marketing company that usually does a bang-up job hyping its products. Its first earbuds were a little more style over substance (the performance has improved with more recent models), but this headphone's sturdy, eye-catching design is backed by strong performance. While I have some quibbles with the headphone being a little heavy and slightly prefer the sound quality of some competing models, this is one of the best new headphones of 2025. It will be interesting to see if its price can come down a bit to make it an even more compelling premium noise-canceling headphone option. Read Nothing Headphone (1) review.  ... Show more

Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd gen). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro.Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price.

Sony's improved entry-level noise canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight and very comfortable.

Edifier W830NB
Pros
Affordable
Lightweight and comfortable
Good sound quality and ANC for the price
Strong battery life
USB-C audio
Cons
No carrying case
No 3.5mm jack for wired listening
Why I Like ThemThe Edifier W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, W820NB Plus, and like that earlier popular budget model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android.The W830NBs do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB supports the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable for a wired connection.Reasons to buyThe Edifier W830NB headphones are one of the few budget noise-canceling headphones I recommend to folks who don't want to spend too much on a headphone but want something decent that doesn't look and feel too cheap, is comfortable to wear and delivers respectable sound and noise-canceling.Reasons to skip/keep lookingYou can only expect so much from these headphones. They're better than you'd expect given their price, but more premium models that cost significantly more do offer better performance and built quality. Also, although these have USB-C audio, they're missing a 3.5mm headphone cable to plug into the headphone jack of an inflight entertainment systems. And no carrying case is included.  ... Show more

Good sound with punchy bass for their low price
Decent noise-canceling and voice-calling performance with two levels of ANC
Support LDAC audio codec for compatible devices
Included cable for wired listening
Cons
ANC disabled when in wired mode
Lacking a bit of sound clarity
Earfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with its new-for-2024 Wave Pro headphones. They list for $80, but click the $20-off instant coupon on their product page and add the code EWPROCNET at checkout for some sweet discount. While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. I found them to be a step up from the Soundpeats Space headphones, which sometimes cost a little less.They're rated for up to 80 hours of battery life with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and support multipoint Bluetooth pairing as well as Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android smartphone and other compatible devices.

JBL Live 770NC
Pros
Well-designed and comfortable to wear
Good sound quality and noise-canceling performance
Strong feature set
Strong battery life
Cons
Voice-calling suffers in windy environments
Carrying pouch leaves headphones vulnerable to damage
The well-designed and comfortable JBL Live 770NC offers some modest improvements over its predecessor, including better battery life (up to 65 hours with ANC off and 50 hours with ANC on) and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio (via a future firmware upgrade). Equipped with 40mm drivers, you get bold, nicely defined sound with powerful bass that's relatively tight. JBL's Ambient Aware and TalkThru features are on board along with multipoint Bluetooth pairing (the one feature that's missing is ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off). I thought the headphones' noise muffling capabilities were good and callers said they could hear me well even in noisier environments except when the wind picked up around me. The headphones fold up and a simple carrying pouch (no hard case) is included along with a cable for wired listening.  ... Show more

Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless

SCORE
Pros
Excellent sound
Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Impressive battery life
Good sound personalization features
Cons
Ho-hum design
Noise-canceling isn't as good as Sony's or Bose's
Why I like themSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a pretty distinct look that was part retro, part modern and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of their competitors.The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, although the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that "assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste." Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers "best-in-class" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.Reasons to buyThe Momentum 4 Wireless costs less than flagship models from Sony, Bose and Apple and offer excellent sound and good build quality.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile I'm fan of the Momentum 4 Wireless and like their sound a lot, they're noise canceling and comfort level isn't as good as what you get from the Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5 or WH-1000XM6.  ...

Cons

Why I Like ThemIf you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum 4 Wireless and other premium models from Bose, Sony and Apple, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus is a good midrange alternative that doesn't quite offer the same performance as those higher-end models but offers better build quality and sound than most budget noise canceling headphones. In essence, these are a slightly stripped down version of the Momentum 4 Wireless and share a similar aesthetic and the same touch controls but feature different drivers (the Momentum Wireless 4 have larger 42mm drivers and offer richer, more detailed sound with slightly better bass performance). Still, these sound good for the money, offer respectable noise canceling and support USB-C audio wired listening and the AptX Adaptive audio codec that's compatible with some Android devices.Reasons to buyThey cost about half the price of premium models in the $350-$400 range and deliver 75-80% of their performance while featuring good build quality.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Accentum Plus has a little more clamping force than some headphones so not everybody finds it incredibly comfortable (it helps to stretch the headband and break it in a bit so to speak). While it sound quite good for the money, its noise canceling performance isn't as good as what you get from premium models from Bose and Sony.uild quality  ... Show more

Best legacy-style Bose noise-canceling headphones
Bose QuietComfort Headphones

/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable
Very good sound and noise canceling with new Wind Block feature
Good voice-calling performance with integrated cable microphone and six on-ear mics
USB-C audio for lossless wired listening
Cons
Mostly the same as previous model but costs $50 more
When Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a new, slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the very comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still feature very good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance.As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products "visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language." It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to "help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing." There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in new color options, including green and a light blue version that's only available at bose.com.While the QuietComfort Headphones carry a $350 list price that's $50 higher than that of the QC 45s, we expect them to be regularly discounted to $250 and possibly less than that in 2024 -- so look to buy them when they're on sale. You can read our review of the QuietComfort 45 to get a good take on the QuietComfort Headphones.  ... Show more

Best noise-canceling headphones for great bass
Sony ULT Wear
8.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable
Improved sound quality and noise-canceling performance
Upgraded microphones
Quick attention mode returns
Cons
Bass can get a little boomy, especially with ULT button engaged
Headphones look a little big
No USB-C audio
The ULT Wear (WH-ULT900N) is the successor to Sony's popular extra bass model, the WH-XB910N, and features upgraded drivers (better sound) along with improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance. Both Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 and entry-level CH-720N offer more balanced sound, but the ULT Wear deliver on their promise of delivering dynamic, powerful sound with deep bass. The only downside is that bass can get sometimes get a little too boomy, especially when you engage the bass boost mode with the ULT button.

Best noise-canceling headphones under $100
JBL Tune 670NC
Pros
Relatively comfortable for an on-ear headphone
Good sound quality
Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Excellent battery life
Cons
No carrying case
The JBL Tune 670NC is one of a relatively small number of on-ear headphones to offer active noise canceling. It's something of a value model -- no carrying case is included -- but it does have memory foam ear pads that get you a comfortable fit for an on-ear headphone. Deliver clear sound with punch bass, it has 32mm drivers and improves on its predecessor's battery life, offering up to a whopping 70 hours (or 44 hours with ANC on), and an extra three hours of battery with just five minutes of charge. This model includes the latest Bluetooth 5.3 (with LE Audio) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. It also has JBL's Ambient Aware (transparency mode) and TalkThru features. It's available in black, white and blue and comes with a cord for wired listening.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing noise-canceling headphones
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new ANC headphones. The quality of value-priced noise canceling headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headphones for less than $100. But the premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more -- sometimes much more. Fit (comfort)It's key that the headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear over the course of a day with minimal breaks.DurabilityYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality.Maximize performance and features for your budgetYou want the best-sounding headphones with the best noise-canceling, call quality, and features for whatever you're able to spend.Return policyIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one. How we test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds
We test noise-canceling headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value. DesignEvaluating design, we first assess how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics), typically testing each model for several hours across multiple days. For over-ear headphones, we check for adequate ear cup padding, headband pressure and heat buildup. With earbuds, we test all included ear tip sizes and evaluate their stability during movement or other physical activity. Build quality assessment includes stress testing hinges and folding mechanisms, examining material durability and verifying IP (dust- and water-resistance) ratings when applicable. Sound qualityWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Some of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit. Tested sonic traits include: Frequency responseTonal balanceSoundstage width and depthDetail retrieval and instrument separationBass response and controlMidrange clarity and vocal reproductionHigh-frequency extension without harshnessNoise-canceling performanceWe evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where test their ability in: Public transit environments (buses, trains and subway platforms)Busy street intersections for traffic and construction noiseAreas with ambient chatter and voicesEach environment is tested several times. Extra featuresSome great-sounding noise-canceling headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes like EQ customization to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. Models with Bluetooth multipoint, or the ability to connect to several devices at once, are also noted within the "additional details" section of each product. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user friendly it is as well as battery life claims. Voice callingWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voice. We assess their reaction to traffic noise and windy conditions for microphone performance. We also move between quiet and noisy environments to test their response. We collect feedback from call recipients about voice clarity and background noise reduction. ValueWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.
Other noise-canceling headphones we tested
Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S2: Bowers & Wilkins released the PX7 S2 headphones in 2022 with some significant improvements over the first-generation version.That was followed by a slightly upgraded version, the PX7 S2e ($400), with the "e" standing for evolved. The audio quality has been slightly upgraded thanks to improved digital processing (the headphones have been retuned), which we assume involves an upgraded chip. You may see this model nicely discounted because Bowers & Wilkins has released the PX7 S3 ($450) in 2025 with both design and performance upgrades.1More SonoFlow: The design of 1More's SonoFlow headphones reminds me a little of some earlier Sony headphones and also the newer Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 4. They're a bit generic looking, but they're sleek enough, and more importantly, they're comfortable to wear. They also feature very respectable sound quality. Though it doesn't quite measure up to the sound quality of what you'll get with more premium models like the Momentum Wireless 4, it isn't that far off. The SonoFlow headphones deliver smooth sound with good clarity and relatively well-defined bass (they're just not quite as rich or dynamic sounding as those premium models I mentioned). They also have support for the LDAC audio codec.Google Pixel Buds Pro: The Pixel Buds Pro are Google's first earbuds to feature active noise canceling. While it's nice that they finally have a feature that a lot of true-wireless earbuds have had for a while, what ultimately sets the Pixel Buds Pro apart and makes them worth considering -- particularly for Android users -- is their distinct design and winning fit. That helps enhance their performance on both the sound quality and noise-canceling fronts. While not quite elite for voice-calling, they also performed well as a headset for making calls. Read our Google Pixel Buds Pro review. Soundcore by Anker Space One: Available in three color options, the Soundcore Space One are Anker's latest noise-canceling headphones and a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance. They can't quite compete sound-wise with many of the premium noise-canceling models, but you don't feel like you're giving up that much on the sound front to save a good deal of money. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, but the Space Ones sound respectable, with decent clarity and bass definition and measure up well to the more expensive Soundcore Space 45. Noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are also good for headphones in this price range, though the transparency mode is only OK. Anker has developed a version of Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature -- Anker calls it Easy Chat -- that automatically pauses your music and enters a transparency mode when you walk up to someone and start a conversation. The headphones are equipped with wear-detection sensors, a feature not usually found at this price, and include a carrying pouch. LDAC audio codec support is available for Android users.Shure Aonic 50: A lot of us liked Shure's original Aonic 50 headphones, but they had pretty middling noise cancellation. Well, the 2nd-gen version addresses that issue -- the noise canceling is much improved -- and Shure has more than doubled the the battery life to around 45 hours (they now have a quick-charge feature) and also shrunk the headphone's carry case a bit, though it's still not that compact. Those upgrades make the Aonic 50 Gen 2 a top noise-canceling headphone. While the Aonic 50 Gen 2s are pretty heavy at 334 grams, they're built sturdily and are also comfortable to wear, with nicely padded ear cups. They feature excellent sound quality with very good clarity and well-defined bass. Shure call them a "studio headphone," so the sound profile is fairly neutral, but you can add more bass in the EQ settings in Shure's companion app for iOS and Android (engaging the Spatializer setting in the app expands the soundstage slightly but doesn't make a big difference).Mark Levinson No. 5909: The No. 5909 are premium audio brand Mark Levinson's first headphones and, yes, they're really expensive at $999. But they're also really good. They have a sturdy design without managing to feel hefty on your head (read: they're substantial but not too heavy) and they're comfortable to wear over long periods thanks to their nicely padded (and replaceable) leather-covered earcups and headband. Read our Mark Levinson No. 5909 hands-on. Focal Bathys: French audio company Focal is known for its high-end speaker systems and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. These $699 cans sound fantastic and are great overall but their noise-canceling is fairly light, so don't buy them for their ANC. Learn more about the premium model in our full Focal Bathys hands-on.Master & Dynamic MW09: Master & Dynamic headphones and earbuds have always featured unique, eye-catching designs that include premium materials like aluminum, sapphire glass and Kevlar. Its latest MW09 flagship earbuds look pretty similar to its earlier MW08 buds, but have some upgrades on the inside that deliver better performance, particularly when it comes to battery life and noise canceling (it's now very close to what Bose and Sony offer, though not quite at their level for ANC).Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro: The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer improved noise canceling along with very good sound and voice-calling performance, plus support for high-resolution wireless audio streaming if you're a Galaxy device owner with the right setup. That said, their biggest upgrade may be their new design and smaller size, which make them a better fit for more ears. Aside from their somewhat high price tag, their only drawback is that some of their key features only work with Samsung Galaxy devices. So if you're a Galaxy user or otherwise interested in the model, you can read more in my full Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro review. Beats Studio Buds Plus: Alas, for those of you who bought the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market for now, I'm sorry to report that these new Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. If you're interested in making the upgrade, check out my full Beats Studio Buds Plus review. Beats Fit Pro: While the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and 2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. Read more about the model in my full Beats Fit Pro review. Technics EAH-A800: There's a bit of an old-school vibe to the Technics EAH-A800 -- and it's not just the Technics brand, which Panasonic resurrected in the last few years. Their design is something of a throwback but the headphones are comfortable and both fold up and fold flat. They feature a big, energetic sound with powerful bass and good detail (however, they take a day or two to break in). Technics EAH-AZ80: Panasonic has done a nice job of creating an all-around top-performing set of buds that offer an improved fit with terrific sound, good noise canceling and a robust feature set. Noise-canceling headphone FAQs
Are noise-cancelling headphones worth it?
A few years ago, you had to pay significantly more money for active noise-cancelling headphones. But the feature has become pretty common and while the best noise-cancelling headphones (by that I mean the headphones that offer the best noise canceling) tend to be fairly expensive, you can find cheaper models that offer decent noise cancellation. I do think that if noise canceling is important to you, it's better to spend more money on the best pair of noise-cancelling headphones you can afford. And it's worth noting that many of the premium models get discounted sporadically during the year so you can often save $50 or more on many top headphones if you time your purchase right.

What's the difference between 'Noise Canceling' vs. 'Noise Cancelling'
Either spelling is correct, as "canceling" is more common in American English while "cancelling" is more common in British English. CNET uses "noise canceling" since the company is based in the US, but the noise is canceled just the same, regardless of spelling. If you're looking to see what different noise-impacting technology is out there for headphones, check out our article on noise-canceling versus noise-isolating headphones, which highlights differences in function (and not just a difference in spelling).

Does noise cancellation block all noise?
Noise-cancelling headphones have traditionally been good at blocking out lower frequency sounds such as the rumbling you hear while traveling on a plane. They haven't been so good at muffling higher frequencies (a baby screaming, for example) and even people talking around you. But companies like Bose, Sony and Apple have improved the technology in the last year or two so their noise canceling works across a wider frequency range with a greater frequency response. It still can't muffle all noise but top noise canceling is now doing a better job tamping down more noises that live in midrange and higher frequencies.
Show more
Does noise cancelling drain the headphones' battery?
When noise canceling is engaged, it does tend to have an impact on battery life. This is more of a factor with earbuds, which tend to offer anywhere from five to eight hours of battery life with noise canceling on and seven to 12 hours with it off. Full-size headphones can offer 25 to 30 hours of battery life with noise canceling on and up to 40 to 50 hours with it off.
Show more
Does noise cancelling impact sound quality?
Active noise cancellation does have an adverse effect on sound quality, especially if the noise canceling isn't all that good (noise canceling can create a faint background hiss). It can mess with the purity of the sound quality so it's tricky to create a noise-canceling headphone that sounds really good. As a result, often high-end noise-canceling headphones that tout fantastic sound quality don't have as powerful noise canceling (the noise canceling feels lighter).
Show more
Can I use noise-cancelling headphones with Dolby Atmos audio?
Yes, you can use both audio features at the same time. While you won't need special headphones to play Dolby Atmos -- just a Dolby Atmos-enabled device and audio -- noise cancelling headphones can add an even more space, clarity, and depth to your audio experience that rivals the surround sound experienced in a home theater system.
Show more
Are noise-cancelling headphones waterproof?
Some noise-cancelling headphones are at least water-resistant, with IP ratings of around IPX4. However, many over- and on-ear noise-cancelling headphones are not waterproof, as is expected for their model (most over- and on-ear headphones are not waterproof). If you're looking for noise-cancelling headphones to use in the rain, we recommend looking at earbuds rather than headphones, like the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Apple AirPods, or the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds.
