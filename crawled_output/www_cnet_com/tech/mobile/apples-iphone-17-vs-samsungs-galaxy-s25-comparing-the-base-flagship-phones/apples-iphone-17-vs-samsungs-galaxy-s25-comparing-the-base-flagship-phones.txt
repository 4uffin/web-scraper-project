Apple's iPhone 17 vs. Samsung's Galaxy S25: Comparing the Base Flagship Phones
Apple and Samsung each offer a lot in their $800 phones, so we'll compare to see the biggest differences.
Nicole Lee Writer I started my career with CNET all the way back in 2005, when the (original) Motorola Razrs were all the rage. Since then, I've written about everything from consumer electronics to internet culture for outlets like CNET, Engadget and Yahoo. Outside of work, I'm a big fan of baseball, board games, tabletop RPGs and improv comedy.

Apple's iPhone 17 and the Samsung Galaxy S25. Cole Kan/CNET/Apple/Samsung
There's a new Apple flagship phone in town: the long-awaited iPhone 17. The $799 iPhone 17 is the base model of the new iPhone lineup, which is now on sale with the $999 iPhone Air, $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro and $1,199 iPhone 17 Pro Max. While the iPhone 17 is the most affordable option among the new phones, there's nothing basic about it. It features plenty of updates like a 120Hz display, upgraded cameras and a faster A19 chip. Since there's a new base iPhone, we figure it's only fitting to compare it to one of its toughest competitors: the base Galaxy S25 from Samsung. The two have very similar characteristics and would make excellent smartphones, depending on whether you're on the Apple or Android side of the divide. So how do these two flagships stack up? Let's take a closer look. See iPhone 17 at AppleSee Galaxy S25 at SamsungDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.DisplayOne of the biggest updates to the iPhone 17 over its predecessor is that it finally has a ProMotion display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, which has only been in the iPhone's Pro models to this point. This allows for an always-on display so you can glance at your notifications and Live Activities without having to wake the screen. Plus, it offers a smoother experience when playing games or scrolling through the web. Aside from the refresh rate, the iPhone 17's 6.3-inch OLED screen has a 2,622x1,206-pixel resolution and 3,000 nits of brightness.

Samsung's Galaxy line has had a 120Hz variable refresh rate for a while (ever since the S20), and it's no different with the Galaxy S25. The S25 also has an always-on display option, which can be configured to show all the time or by tapping the screen. Its 6.2-inch AMOLED display isn't quite as sharp with a 2,340x1,080-pixel resolution, and it's also not quite as bright, at 2,600 nits at peak brightness.
The iPhone 17 has a 48-megapixel main camera and a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera. Abrar Al-Heeti/ Zooey Liao/ CNETCamerasWhen it comes to the number of cameras, the Galaxy S25 has the iPhone 17 beat. It has not one, not two, but three cameras: A 50-megapixel wide, a 12-megapixel ultrawide and a 10-megapixel telephoto. The iPhone 17, on the other hand, just has two: a 48-megapixel wide and a rather impressive 48-megapixel ultrawide. The Galaxy S25's telephoto camera supports a 3x optical zoom, while the iPhone 17 supports a 2x optical zoom. The S25's front-facing camera has a 12-megapixel lens, while the iPhone 17's has an 18-megapixel one. The iPhone 17 also boasts a new Center Stage feature that lets you take landscape selfies without rotating the phone. In terms of video, the S25 can shoot in 8K video at 30 frames per second, while the iPhone 17 can shoot in 4K at 30 and 60 frames per second.
The Samsung Galaxy S25 (right), pictured here with the Plus edition, has three cameras. These include a 50-megapixel wide, 12-megapixel ultrawide and a 10-megapixel telephoto. James Martin/CNETBattery lifeApple hasn't shared the exact battery specs of the iPhone 17, but we do know it has up to 30 hours of video playback. According to the company, it also uses a new AI-powered Adaptive Power feature on iOS 26 that can help conserve battery life with performance adjustments. The Galaxy S25 has a 4,000-mAh battery, which Samsung says provides up to 29 hours of video playback. In our tests, we said that the Galaxy S25 lasts around a day and a half with regular use, while the iPhone 17 lasts more than a day. As of this writing, we're still busy testing the iPhone 17, but it appears that the two phones are pretty comparable when it comes to battery life. PriceBoth the iPhone 17 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 start at around $800, but at very different storage sizes. The iPhone 17 starts at $799 ($829 if you get it without a carrier) for the 256GB version, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 will cost you $800 for the 128GB model. Stepping up to the 256GB edition of the Galaxy S25 adds $60 to the price.Check out the specs chart below for more comparisons between the iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S25.Apple iPhone 17 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25
