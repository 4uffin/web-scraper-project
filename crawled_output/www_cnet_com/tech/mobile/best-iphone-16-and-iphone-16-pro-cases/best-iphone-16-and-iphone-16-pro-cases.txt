Reviews ethics statement
How we test
What to consider
MagSafe
We generally encourage people to spend the extra money for a MagSafe-enabled case because of the number of MagSafe accessories on the market.
Thickness
Some people like minimal cases that add little to no bulk to their iPhone, but the majority of people are looking for a case that offers good protection.
Clear case
Clear cases are popular because they show off your phone (and its color). Clear cases, especially cheaper ones, can become less clear over time.

Back to selection
As part of this buying guide, I've included a diverse selection of top cases for the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max at a variety of price points. Note that the iPhone 16 Series has a new camera layout and a programmable action button, meaning cases from previous models won’t fit. The new camera control button is touch-sensitive, and case manufacturers offer varying degrees of exposure to the button, with some cases having cutouts for it and others covering the button while maintaining the button's touch sensitivity. In my mini review for each case, I've noted how each model allows you to access the camera control button.

Top new Otterbox cases for iPhone 16
Otterbox Symmetry Series
Pros
Slim, yet protective
Easy to grip and comfortable to hold
MagSafe compatible
Made from recycled materials
Cons
Camera button can be finicky
May show scratches
Lacks strong rear camera protection
A more expensive option
Otterbox returns with its usual expansive lineup of cases for the iPhone 16. In terms of toughness, the Defender Series XT and Defender Series Pro top the line. Even the slimmer Figura, Symmetry Series Clear and OtterGrip Symmetry Series have excellent drop protection.I remain a fan of the Symmetry Series Soft Touch for MagSafe (pictured left), which has a nice, grippy soft-to-the-touch finish that's similar to what you get with the highly likable Core Series cases Otterbox made for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15. I also like the Lumen Series (pictured right), a clear case that has eye-catching iridescent accents in its MagSafe components.For me, another favorite Otterbox case for the iPhone 16 is the Symmetry Series Cactus Leather (pictured center), which incorporates a cactus-based leather substitute in its design (Otterbox says the faux leather is organically grown and sustainably harvested from nopal cactus). The cases have a nice textured grip to them and are available in attractive color options. In my tests, the cases have held up well and are fairly scratch-resistant.Type of access to camera control button: Touch-sensitive integrated control button cover.

Speck's new cases for iPhone 16
Speck Presidio ClickLock cases
Pros
ClickLock system enables secure fit for Speck accessories
Durable yet attractive design
Antimicrobial protection
Ultra-responsive buttons for smoother clicks
Cons
Somewhat pricey
Porous material is susceptible to staining
Grip leaves something to be desired
Speck has brought many of its iPhone 15 case designs to the iPhone 16, including such popular models as the
Presidio Perfect-Clear, Presidio Lux and the Presidio2 Pro. Each Speck model has good drop protection (8 to 13 feet, depending on the model) as well as Speck's Microban antimicrobial protection. They also include ultra-responsive buttons for smoother clicks on the new programmable action button.
It also returns its ClickLock case system, which is built on MagSafe: It's compatible with any MagSafe accessory but has an interlocking system that secures Speck's ClickLock accessories to your case. In addition to adhering to the case magnetically, the accessories -- which range in price from $30 to $50 -- click into a little slot. For people who own the larger and heavier iPhone 16 Plus or 16 Pro Max, it can be hard to depend on your phone staying on a MagSafe car mount, especially if you hit a bump. That's where Speck's ClickLock car vent mount helps. The wallet accessory stays stuck on the back of your phone; you don't have to worry about it slipping off when you put your phone in your pocket.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Best value iPhone 16 MagSafe case with kickstand
Caseology Capella Mag Kickstand
Pros
Budget-friendly while still MagSafe compatible
Built-in kickstand that doesn't interfere with MagSafe use
Slim, sleek design
Cons
May yellow/discolor over time, even with UV protection
Drop protection is only OK
Caseology makes some decent budget cases, including the Athlex Mag, Parallax, Dual Grip Mag and Capella Mag, all of which cost less than $20. Its Capella Mag Kickstand is one of the cheaper transparent MagSafe cases we've seen that has a built-in kickstand that retracts into the case when not in use so you can attach MagSafe accessories. You can see all of Caseology's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases here.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ... Show more

Affordable iPhone 16 case with built-in kickstand and MagSafe
ESR Kickstand case
Pros
Silicone, clear and rugged finishes available
Built-in kickstand doubles as lens protector&nbsp;
Well-priced with a premium feel
15° to 85° angles for comfortable, hands-free viewing
Cons
Kickstand in portrait mode tilts at an angle rather than fully upright
MagSafe magnet isn't very strong
Charging hole may not accommodate every sized charger
ESR Kickstand cases aren't your typical cases with an integrated kickstand. That's because the kickstand doesn't flip out of the backside of the case at the bottom. Instead, it serves as a protective ring around your camera lenses when it's retracted and not in use (ESR calls it a foldable stash stand). The stand can be extended anywhere between 15° and 85° for comfortable, hands-free viewing. You'll find other generic cases on Amazon with a design like this, but ESR stands out for having a more premium feel to its value cases.The case features easy-press buttons with an exposed divot for the new action button as well as MagSafe compatibility for wireless charging. Note that you can get the case in a soft silicone version (shown below), a thicker tough version (it really is tough) and a simple clear version. I like the soft silicone version, but the clear case is the most affordable, selling for around $20. I can't vouch for the clear version not yellowing over time, but it is a decent budget option.Type of access to camera control button: ESR transitioned to a touch-sensitive integrated control button cover but launch versions of its cases have a cutout for the button.

Best slim rugged case with strong MagSafe magnets
Rokform Slim Magnetic Case for iPhone 16 Series
Pros
Highly protective and durable, yet slimmed down for comfort
Great for mounting
Exceptionally strong MagSafe magnets
Often on sale
Cons
Compatible mounts sold separately
Very expensive
Not compatible with RokLok twist system
Must remove center magnet to wirelessly charge
Rokform is known for its rugged cases for iPhones and other smartphones. Its earlier Rokform Crystal and Rugged case are highly protective but may be little too chunky for some people. That's why Rokform came up with a new case in 2025 called the Rokform Slim Magnetic case that's 35% slimmer than its previous models and is one of the top iPhone cases on the market (it's available for all iPhone 16 Series models). Not only is it very protective, with excellent corner and camera protection, but its ring magnet for MagSafe accessories is one of the strongest out there, if not the strongest.Rokform's Crystal and Rugged cases are specially designed to work with Rokform's various mounts, including bike and motorcycle mounts, that are sold separately. However, the Slim Magnetic case doesn't have Rokform's RokLok twist system, so it only works with Rokform's magnetic car mounts (and, of course, third-party magnetic accessories). I've tried all of Rokform's cases, including the new Slim Magnetic case, with Apple's FineWoven Wallet and the wallet stuck to the cases more securely than with any cases I've tested.Note that the Rokform Rugged and Crystal cases have removable magnets, and they're compatible with wireless charging if you remove the included center magnet. "With the lower magnet still intact, you can still wireless-charge while utilizing magnetic mounting and all of our mounts," Rokform says. The cases are expensive, but Rokform offers discounts to first-time buyers on its site. Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ... Show more

Top protective iPhone 16 cases with eye-catching designs
Zagg cases
Pros
Fairly slim yet highly protective with very good drop protection
Several styles available, including integrated kickstands
Graphene-infused for extra durability
Beveled edges add screen and camera protection
Cons
Pricey with no true budget options
Designs are susceptible to discoloration and staining
A few years back Zagg bought British case-maker Gear4 and continued selling Gear4 cases under the original brand name. With the introduction of the iPhone 15, Gear4 cases officially became Zagg cases, but the quality hasn't changed -- they're right up there with OtterBox and Speck, all of them featuring beveled edges to protect your phone and now infused with graphene for extra durability. For the iPhone 16, Zagg has improved the design of its integrated kickstand for models that feature one -- I like the Denali with kickstand (pictured left) and the Crystal Palace with kickstand (picture right). I'm also a fan of the Milan Snap in iridescent (pictured middle left) and the new London Snap (center right), which comes in a variety of designs with a raised fabric exterior. Several other case styles are available with eye-catching designs and strong drop protection up to 16 feet.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.   ...

Top budget MagSafe case for iPhone 16
Spigen Ultra Hybrid MagFit
Pros
Budget option with MagSafe compatibility
Slim and sleek design without bulk
Tactile, easy-to-press buttons
Cons
Some designs may discolor/yellow over time
Only moderate protection
Limited gripping
Spigen is known for its value cases for smartphones and it returns with its usual assortment of cases for the iPhone 16 series, including slim clear cases and slightly thicker cases in its Tough Armor and Rugged Armor that offer a little more protection. If you're looking for an inexpensive clear MagSafe case for your new iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro models, Spigen's Ultra Hybrid MagFit is a good value for less than $20. I like some of the Ultra Hybrid models that have computer component accents integrated into them. These include the Ultra Hybrid Analogue (pictured), Zero One and Neo One.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.

iPhone 16 cases with fun designs
Casely cases
Pros
Excellent design with several options
Durable with military-grade drop protection
More affordable than comparable Casetify cases
Cons
Paint may chip or show scratches
MagSafe magnets could be stronger
With their eye-catching art and patterns, Casely cases are a little like Casetify cases except they don't cost nearly as much. I don't like all the designs, but there are plenty of options to choose from, and the company does some interesting collaborations with museums (Van Gogh), as well as living artists. The cases themselves offer "military-grade" protection and feel durable. Many are MagSafe-enabled. It's also worth noting that the Casely site sometimes offers discount codes or BOGO deals (buy one case, get one free).Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Affordable Magsafe case for iPhone 16
Cyrill UltraSheer Mag
Pros
Reinforced curved bumpers for screen and camera protection
Good button feel and responsiveness
Anti-slip grip around edges
Cons
Designs may chip, peel or show scratches
Difficult to take on and off
Cyrill is a sister brand to Spigen, and its cases are arguably slightly more stylish, although they cost a few bucks more too. The
UltraSheer Mag is a semi-translucent frosted matte finish. It also comes in a few other design options, although note that unless you get one of the solid colors, the designs are stuck onto the surface of the case (they're essentially stickers similar to what Casetify does with its cases, which have become very expensive).Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Variety of iPhone 16 kickstand-style cases
Torras cases
Pros
Multiple kickstand styles to choose from
Soft-touch finish with good grip (except for clear cases)
Decent drop protection
Cons
Metal kickstand ring heats up while wirelessly charging
Kickstands may interfere with MagSafe accessories
Torras makes several cases with integrated kickstands, but they each have their own style of stand. They include a Slim Fit case with a retractable kickstand ring around the camera and its standard Ostand case, which has a retractable ring around the MagSafe ring. New for the iPhone 16 is its 360-degree Spin Magnetic Stand case which is similar to the Ostand case but the ring swivels 360 degrees. Aside from the clear versions of the cases, which feature a hard plastic design, most of the other versions have a soft-touch finish that offers good grip. MagSafe accessories adhere securely to the cases and they also feature good drop protection (with the exception of the Slim Fit case, which is rather slim). Prices for Torras cases start around $22 and go up to around $45.Type of access to camera control button: ESR transitioned to a touch-sensitive integrated control button cover but launch versions of its cases have a cutout for the button.

Best iPhone 16 cases with crossbody option
Mageasy cases
Pros
Excellent drop protection up to 25 feet
Crossbody strap with removable eyelets (don't have to use a strap) included with some models
360° rotation kickstand for landscape and portrait hands-free viewing available
Range of price options
Cons
Often quite bulky
Mageasy and SwitchEasy are owned by the same parent company (Mageasy) and share some distinct similarities. I included SwitchEasy cases in my best iPhone 15 cases round up last year, but I'm highlighing Mageasy cases this year. Ranging in price from $30-$80, there are several Mageasy case options for the various iPhone 16 models, including some that come with a crossbody strap and retractable ring kickstand that rotates 360-degrees so you can prop up your phone in landscape or portrait mode. The Odyssey Ultra M Plus Strap ($80) is Mageasy's flagship case and features 25-foot drop protection. While the Odyssey M Plus Strap ($50) doesn't have the built-in kickstand, it is more affordable and also has excellent 20-foot drop protection. They're both available in a few color options. Note that you don't have to use the cases with the strap. The eyelets are removable. Just don't lose them if you want to use the strap in the future. I should also note that while the Odyssey Ultra M is a really protective case, it is a bit weighty. Some simpler Mageasy cases are lighter.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ... Show more

Best variety of tough iPhone 16 cases
Urban Armor iPhone 16 cases
Pros
Excellent corner protection
Distinctive design with several accessory options (including kickstand)
Strong MagSafe magnets for secure connectivity
Cons
More expensive option (up to $80)
Rugged/industrial design may not appeal to everyone
Urban Armor Gear, also known simply as UAG, returns with a variety of case options for the iPhone 16. Some of them are slimmer, more compact models like the Civilian (pictured in green on right), Plyo, Essential and Metropolis, while others like the Pathfinder (pictured on left) and Monarch are a little bulkier and more rugged. Once again, the toughest and most expensive case is the Monarch Pro, but I'm still a fan of the Plasma (pictured middle right), which now comes in an XTE version that integrates a retractable kickstand, which is nice (Magsafe accessories stick securely to the ring). The slimmer Plyo XTE also has an integrated kickstand. All of UAG's cases feature good corner protection and meet military drop-test standards. They start at $50 and go all the way up to $80, but most are in the $50 to $60 range.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.   ... Show more

Slim, tough iPhone 16 cases
Mous cases
Pros
Excellent drop protection despite slim profile
Several unique design options, including bamboo and carbon fiber, among others
Durable with a lifetime warranty
Cons
Fairly pricey
Poor scratch resistance
Button responsiveness is limited
You may have seen ads for Mous cases on YouTube or social media in which the company drops a phone from a helicopter and shows how the phone survives the fall. While Mous cases aren't rated for 1,000-feet drop protection, they do offer excellent protection and are pretty slim. I've always liked the Mous' Limited Series cases that feature backs with bamboo, carbon fiber and various other materials, and they're certainly more unique-looking. But those MagSafe-enabled cases are pretty pricey, though they do have a lifetime warranty, as all Mous cases do.Note that in early 2025 Mous has upgraded certain cases with the option of getting a touch-sensitive camera control button that covers the iPhone 16's camera control button instead of having a cutout in the case to expose the button. The upgraded button option is currently only available on Mous' website and adds $5 to the cost of the case.
Mous also makes more standard Magsafe-enabled clear cases that cost less, and I included its IntraLock case in our best bike phone mount list. That case snaps into a bike mount, and Mous makes a variety of other MagSafe accessories including a wallet, phone grip with kickstand and magnetic car mounts.Type of access to camera control button: Mous transitioned to a touch-sensitive integrated control button cover but launch versions of its cases have a cutout for the button.

Eye-catching recycled wood iPhone 16 case
Atom Studio Wood Fiber case
Pros
Unique, eye-catching design with textured grip and aluminum accent
Made from natural materials, including recycled wood fiber
Solid 10-foot drop protection
Strong magnet for MagSafe accessories
Cons
More expensive than other options
Atom Studios makes a few different iPhone 16 cases, including one that just covers the back of your phone for whose who like to go with a minimalist case -- or no case at all. But the one I like best from Atom is its Wood Fiber case, which is made out of bits of recycled wood fiber blended with natural substances derived from corn starch (it feels like textured plastic and has some grip to it). It also has an aluminum accent at the top of the case that gives the case a more premium look. The case is relatively slim and offers solid 10-foot drop protection along with a stronger than average magnet for MagSafe accessories (I tested the case with a few MagSafe-enabled wallets and kickstands).Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.

Peak Design Everyday iPhone 16 cases
Pros
Durable and attractively designed with nylon and leather options (among others)
Compatible with a variety of Peak Design accessories with SlimLink magnetic locking system
MagSafe compatible
Cons

Action button cutout may be too small for some
SlimLink lock system not compatible with wallet
Peak Design's Everyday cases return for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models. Available in a variety of colors in nylon fabric and faux leather, as well as Loop model, all the Everyday cases are MagSafe-compatible in that you can connect a MagSafe wireless charging puck and other magnetic MagSafe-compatible accessories to the case, including wireless charging batteries, wallets and more. They have Peak Design's own built-in magnetic locking system -- the company calls it SlimLink -- that connects to a wide assortment of Peak Design's mobile mounts and accessories. That includes bike mounts, charging stands, tripods, car mounts and more.

Swanky leather iPhone 16 cases
Nomad cases
Pros
Excellent brand trusted for leather cases
Several options available with different price points
Developed patina look is unique to each phone
Cons
MagSafe compatibility costs extra
Apple isn't making leather cases for the iPhone 16, but others, including Nomad, still are. Nomad's line of leather cases for the iPhone 16 once again come in two grades of leather: the standard variety and a higher-end Horween that costs $20 more ($70 rather than $50). At least the Horween version is designed to develop a "rugged" patina as the oils from your skin interact with the leather over time. The Modern Leather Case is available in black, brown, English tan and a lighter natural color that I like. They're rated for 10-foot (3-meter) drop protection and are equipped with MagSafe. I also like Modern Leather Folio wallet case, but once again the one drawback to the Folio case is that it doesn't convert into a kickstand like some wallet cases do. There's also a more affordable Sport version for $50 that's equipped with MagSafe as well. It's not a leather case, but it does look pretty slick. Additionally, Nomad offers the Rugged Case with "fortified" bumpers and 15-foot drop protection for $60 with MagSafe.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Best waterproof case for iPhone 16
OtterBox Frē Series (designed by Lifeproof)
Pros
Waterproof for 2 meters up to 1 hour
5X military standard drop defense
Integrated screen protector
Built-in anchors to connect straps
Cons
Expensive
Screen protector reduces image clarity and touch-sensitivity a bit
The iPhone 16 series has an IP68 rating, which means it's waterproof, and can be submerged in up to 2 meters of water for up to 30 minutes and survive. But if you want even more waterproofing protection, the OtterBox Frē Series cases might be right for you. These cases will allow your phone to survive even longer underwater, features camera and ports covers and an integrated plastic screen protector (Otterbox says the case offers 360-degree protection). Originally, the Frē Series was a Lifeproof case, but Otterbox bought Lifeproof several years ago and rebranded the case as its own, though it says the case is still engineered by Lifeproof. The Frē Series remains a very protective case with 5X military standard drop defenses, and is a good option for sporting activities, particularly more extreme ones (note that it has built-in magnets so it is MagSafe-compatible). That said, the screen protector does reduce the image clarity and touch-sensitivity a bit, and the case is expensive, so only get this case if maximum protection is what you're looking for. Type of access to camera control button: Touch-sensitive integrated control button cover.

Top minimalist case for iPhone 16
Arc Pulse
Pros
Lightweight two-piece bumper case made out of aerospace-grade aluminum
Good corner and camera protection
Leaves most of your phone exposed
Cons
Pricey
No protection for the back and sides of your phone
My colleague Joe Kaminski always talks about how he likes to be able to feel his naked iPhone 16 Pro Max in his hand and doesn't like sticking a full-fledged case on it. But he does want some protection, even if he usually buys Apple Care. He typically uses a bumper case that leaves the back of his phone exposed, but when I showed him the Arc Pulse case, which is made out of "aerospace-grade" aluminum and comes in a few different finishes (the polished silver option is pictured here), he immediately wanted it for his phone. The idea behind this minimalist case is that it leaves most of your phone exposed but protects the corners along with the camera. The raised corner protection also helps prevent your screen from getting cracked should you drop your phone (surprisingly, the Arc Pulse is rated for 10-foot drop protection). The two-piece case comes in a very small package and is relatively easy to put on your phone, though I did take a look at the companion instructional video (accessible via a QR code) to make sure I was doing everything correctly. Yes, you can find other cases like this on Amazon that cost less, but you're paying extra for the aerospace-grade aluminum.Type of access to camera control button: This minimalist case leaves camera control button totally exposed, no cutout required.

Durable case with sound augmentation
Catalyst Influence
Pros
Clean look
Good drop-protection
Augments the sound from your phone's speakers by shifting the sound's direction
Lanyard-friendly
MagSafe-enabled
Cons
The case seems like it should cost $10-$20 less
Like Lifeproof, Catalyst made a name for itself with waterproof cases. While it still makes one for the iPhone 16 Series (it's called the Catalyst Waterproof Total Protection case), it's most popular and best case is the Influence, which comes in 3 color options as well as MagSafe and non-MagSafe versions (get the one that's MagSafe-enabled). Rated for 10-foot drop protection, the Influence has perforations on the corners that allow you to attach various accessories (a lanyard is included, but Catalyst also sells other accessories). Also, the bottom of the case covers your phone's speakers and redirects the sound up, shifting it 90% so it fires directly at you, making everything you listen to sound a little louder (Catalyst says 30% louder). It's a nice little feature that does seem to augment your phone's sound a bit with better directionality. The Influence remains one of my favorite iPhone cases, though I think it should be called the Influencer. Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.

Top vegan leather iPhone 16 case
Moft Movas
Pros
High-quality vegan leather with a nice texture and decent grip
Pairs well with Moft's MagSafe accessories, including wallets, kickstands and tripods
Strong MagSafe magnets for secure connection
Cons
Expensive for vegan leather
Surface may rip or tear with prolonged use
Moft makes some nice MagSafe accessories, including wallets that convert into kickstands and an iPhone Tripod Stand. Its cases are also well-designed and attractive. It sells a very slim clear MagSafe case called the Invisible Case for $40, but I like its faux leather Movas cases, which list for $50 but sometimes sell for $40. (Vegan leather is designed to look and feel like real leather but is synthetic.) You can see the company's full suite of cases and accessories here, including its new Creator kit that bundles a Movas case with a wallet stand, tripod stand and lanyard.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Best full-grain leather case for iPhone 16
Burton Goods Heritage leather case
Pros
Attractively designed high-end leather case that ages nicely
Grip stitching on back that doesn't interfere with MagSafe use
Well-sized cut out for camera control button
Cons
Only compatible with iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max
Case and available accessories are relatively expensive
We used to include Pad & Quill leather cases in our best iPhone cases roundup. In 2023, that Minnesota company morphed into Burton Goods but sells very similar premium leather cases for various Apple products. If you're looking for a folio wallet case, there's the Modern Pocket Book Wallet case ($90), which is a tad bulky but stores multiple credit cards and a bit of cash. As far as non-folio cases go, the MagSafe-enabled Heritage Leather case comes in three color options and is one of the best leather cases out there. Burton Goods also sells a couple of magnetic MagSafe Wallet Stands that adhere nicely to the back of the case. You can get a $40 discount on a Heritage case/wallet bundle and the company also gives 15% off to first-time buyers. Note that Burton Goods only makes cases for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.

Pros
Slim yet protective design with solid drop protection (up to 10 feet)
Tactile press-fit buttons are reactive and easy to press
Good grip with dedicated lanyard loops for added security
Cons
Quality level is not consistent across models
Now owned by Onward Brands, Incase has been making iPhone cases for many years (Griffin and Incipio are also part of Onward Brands).

Pros
Budget-friendly option
Innovative kickstand design with spacious wallet
Cons
MagSafe compatibility is not guaranteed across models
Faux-leather options look a little cheap
Limited color and design options
Smartish's affordable, simple, slim cases and wallet cases return for the iPhone 16. The Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 case (pictured) comes in a few different designs beyond the basic black shown here (Smartish could do a better job offering better color options). It holds three credit cards plus cash, and you can use one of your credit cards as a kickstand. Its one downside is that it's not compatible with wireless and MagSafe chargers.Smartish also sells a MagSafe case called the Gripmunk.

Bluebonnet cases
Pros
Attractive design that's more affordable than other leather options
Integrated wallet and card-holder options available
Solid protection despite no official drop rating
Cons
Very expensive
MagSafe compatibility isn't guaranteed across models
We liked Bluebonnet's leather-clad cases for the iPhone 15, and those same case designs return for the iPhone 16 models. At $60, its more standard Minimalist full-grain leather iPhone case is the most affordable of the four case styles (it's MagSafe compatible). But Bluebonnet's leather wallet cases, including a folio wallet case with a magnetic clasp, are each appealing in their own way, though the two models with the cardholders on back aren't compatible with MagSafe accessories. Available in limited color options (black or tan), they're among the swankier looking leather iPhone cases on the market. Like Nomad cases, they develop a patina after several months of use, picking up the oils from your skin.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Best superthin case
Totallee cases
Pros
Sleek, thin design perfect for minimalists
Multiple color and design options
Cons
Limited drop protection
Expensive for what you get
Some people prefer not to have a case on their phone or just want something that's very thin and offers minimal protection. If you're that type of person, a Totallee case may just be what you're looking for.There are a couple of models to choose from, with the Minimal case billed as the world's thinnest iPhone case; it's almost paper-thin. It comes in multiple color options.The case costs $35, which seems like a lot considering how thin it is, but it is eco-friendly (it's compostable) and does have a raised "lip" around the camera that prevents damage to the camera lens, Totallee says.Totallee also makes a very slim clear TPU case, the "clear soft" that offers a little more protection for the $35 (there's also a new model with MagSafe for $39). I like that one better in some ways -- it does have a little more grip to its finish -- but it is slightly thicker.Type of access to camera control button: Cutout leaves camera control button exposed.  ...

Factors to consider when buying an iPhone 16 case
MagSafe supportYou might be able to save a little money by getting a case that doesn't have MagSafe support (the metal ring built into the case). I generally encourage people to spend the extra money for a MagSafe-enabled case because of the number of MagSafe accessories on the market, some of them quite useful.ThicknessSome people like minimal cases that add little to no bulk to their iPhones, but the majority of people are looking for a case that offers good protection -- or even maximum protection. I tell people to find a case that's not too thick and maybe even pretty slim and that offers at least 6-foot drop protection (and good corner protection).Clear caseClear cases are popular because they show off your phone (and its color). Clear cases, especially cheaper ones, can become less clear over time and slowly start to yellow. Many case makers now add UV protection to their clear cases to prevent yellowing.  How we test the best iPhone 16 cases
Several of the cases on this list were previously available for the iPhone 15 models and we added them to the list based on our previous testing with the iPhone 15. Typically, we try to use the case on the phone for at least a day and make sure the buttons on the phone work properly with the case on. With some phone cases, we use them for several days or even weeks to see how they wear over time. Design: We evaluate the more superficial and cosmetic aspects of cases and consider how aesthetically pleasing they are because people sometimes buy cases solely for their colors and artwork. Durability: We look at how durable a case is, paying particular attention to corner and camera protection (raised corners on a case can help your phone survive face-down falls).Grip factor: We review the material the case is made of so we can talk about such factors as how grippy the phone feels in your hand and how protective the material is. Extra features: Some iPhone cases have extra features such as MagSafe, an integrated kickstand or grips, and, in the case of folio models, slots for storing credit cards and cash.Long-term testing: Although we don't do long-term testing for most cases, we do use some of the most popular cases for longer periods to gauge how they wear over time and see how well our phone holds up during accidental drops with the case on it. We don't do formal drop tests.Waterproof cases: Only a few fully waterproof cases are available, but If the case is supposed to be fully waterproof, we test it by submerging it in water.
We look at design features like the raised corners on this Otterbox case when we test the best iPhone cases. David Carnoy/CNET Other iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro cases we've tested
Wildflower Cases: During the past couple of years, Wildflower phone cases have risen in popularity. Collaborations with music festivals such as Coachella and influencers like Emma Chamberlin have helped the female-founded business gain visibility. Like Casetify, the company offers cases with a plethora of unique, eye-catching designs. However, none of its cases currently has a MagSafe option (you have to buy a ring to stick on the back on the case). That's not cool. iPhone 16 case FAQ
Is USB-C charging an issue with some cases?
With most phone cases, the cutout for the USB-C port is wide enough to allow you to use most USB-C charging cables. Some USB-C charging cables with particularly large heads may not fit certain cases. The USB-C charging cable included with the new iPhones has a relatively compact head.
Show more
How protective of an iPhone 16 case should you buy?
I like cases that aren't too thick but offer decent drop protection, with a lip over the edge of the screen (sometimes referred to as a "screen bumper") and raised corners that help prevent your screen from cracking if your phone should fall face down. A folio case will more fully protect your screen. The good news is that you don't have to buy a super-protective iPhone 16 case like the OtterBox Defender XT to get good protection. Most cases are reasonably thin and still offer at least 6-foot drop protection. I did include one very thin case on this list for folks who prefer minimal protection. Before you go with a case like that, just remember how much your phone costs. It is better than having no case at all. Make sure you get a sound, tempered glass screen protector for your iPhone 16 model to prevent deep scratches and safeguard the screen.
Show more
Should I get a MagSafe case for my iPhone 16?
All the iPhone 16 models are equipped with Apple's MagSafe feature, which offers faster wireless charging with compatible chargers. It also supports optional accessories -- including the MagSafe wallet, mini wallets and various mounts -- that adhere magnetically to the back of your phone. Like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 16 has "an array of magnets" (Apple says they're recycled) embedded around a charging coil that can pull up to 15 watts of power. If you want to use those MagSafe accessories without taking your phone out of its case, you need a phone case that's equipped with MagSafe support. The MagSafe symbol is a circle with a short pipe below it. You can see it on clear cases, but it's embedded on the inside of the case so if it's nontransparent, you'll only see it from the inside. If you already have a MagSafe accessory -- or plan on buying MagSafe accessories in the future -- you'll want to get a MagSafe compatible case; it's a good option to have. With that in mind, the majority of the cases in this roundup are equipped with MagSafe.
Show more
Are MagSafe cases more expensive?
In general, yes -- about $5-$10 more. Some more affordable MagSafe cases cost around $20, but most cost upward of $30. We see cases from certain companies that are essentially the same but one has MagSafe and the other doesn't, and the MagSafe version usually sells for $10 more. It may seem like a little too much to pay for something that doesn't seem like much of an upgrade, but in time MagSafe compatibility may command less of a "tax."

What's more protective - silicon case or leather?
Generally speaking a leather case is more resilient and offers better protection against bumps and scratches compared to silicon cases. However, the fit might not be as snug as a form-fitted silicon case.
