What to consider
Budget
It's important to know how much you want to spend before you start searching.
Microphone
Do you want a boom microphone sticking out of the side of your headset, or something that could be used in more places than just your desk if it meant the microphone wasn't as good?
Comfort
You should be able to wear your headphones all day without pain or awkwardness.
Durability
If you're going to spend this much money, you should know it'll last a while.

The best headsets and headphones for your home office or hybrid setup have a few key traits. You need good ergonomics, excellent voice-calling performance and the ability to connect simultaneously to your phone and PC (Multipoint Bluetooth pairing). I’ve tested numerous headphones and headsets with boom microphones, evaluating noise reduction, comfort, call quality and even music quality. I've included some Unified Communications, or UC, headphones on this list, which come with a tiny USB-A or USB-C dongle to plug into your PC for easier wireless connectivity for Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams calls. However, several of our top picks are mainstream consumer headphones with good microphone performance and ambient noise-reduction that also work well for everyday use. Our Picks

What is the best headset or headphone for working from home?Sony has recently released its new flagship noise-canceling headphone, the . It's comfortable to wear, and it has great noise-canceling and sound quality. It also has excellent voice-calling performance. While expensive, it's arguably the best consumer headphone for working from home right now. However, if you want a headset with a boom microphone that offers greater compatibility with PCs (and Windows PCs in particular), Shokz OpenMeet UC and OpenComm 2 UC are good choices while the Logitech Zone Vibe 100 is a top value option.

Best Sony headphones for working from home
Sony WH-1000XM6
Pros
Upgraded design with more comfortable fit
Improved noise canceling and sound quality
New QN3 chip is seven times as powerful as QN1 chip in XM5
Excellent voice-calling performance with more mics
Improved transparency mode
Spatial audio with head tracking
Cons
$50 more than previous model
No USB-C audio
It's not so clear how you access spatial audio
Over the last several years, Sony has made some of the best noise-canceling headphones on the market, so it's a big deal when the company comes out with a new flagship model, like the WH-1000XM6, which arrives three years after the release of the WH-1000XM5. Though the XM5 was -- and still is -- one of the top over-ear Bluetooth headphones, there's always room for improvement. With the XM6, Sony has fixed the small design flaws of its predecessor while bumping up the overall performance, including voice-calling performance. The result is a headphone that's arguably edged just ahead of the competition and is now at the top of its class. Read our full review of the WH-1000XM5.  ... Show more

Best lightweight comfortable headset
Shokz OpenMeet UC
Pros
Lightweight and very comfortable
Combines bone-conduction tech with air conduction for better sound
Very good voice-calling performance
Open design allows you to hear ambient sound
Nice carry case included
Cons
Designed more for stationary use (sits more loosely on your head)
Open design is less than ideal for noisy environments
Years in development, Shokz OpenMeet comes in a standard version ($220) and a UC version ($250) that includes Shokz' Loop120 USB-A/USB-C wireless dongle for use with Windows and Mac PCs. Equipped with a TitaniumFlex frame and weighing a mere 83 grams, the first thing you notice is how light and comfortable it is (it's designed to be worn for hours). Like other bone-conduction headphones, this headset sits on your cheek in front of your ears and doesn't cover them, leaving them open to hear what's going on around you.Like Shokz OpenRun 2, this headset combines Shokz' bone-conduction technology with its air-conduction speaker technology (Shokz says it's a "Qualcomm-driven" 11mmx18mm custom speaker), which is able to deliver more bass than bone-conduction technology and helps fill out the low end. The result is the headset sounds more like a traditional headphone, offering significantly fuller sound than the company's previous bone-conduction headphones. While there are plenty of $200 headphones and earbuds that sound even better than the OpenMeet, it does offer respectable sound quality.The headset's voice-quality performance was quite good in the test calls I made. Equipped with a dual-microphone system powered by Qualcomm's cVc noise reduction, Shokz says the OpenMeet reduces background noise by up to 98.6%. Note that while the OpenMeet fit my head securely and I was able to walk around with it in the streets of New York, it's really designed for more stationary use. In other words, if you jostle your head too much, the headset will likely slip out of position or slip off your head. Shokz's OpenComm 2 headset, which has a similar design to the company's sport-oriented neckband style headphones like the OpenRun 2 and incorporates a boom microphone, fits more securely but is not as comfortable.  ...

Best bone-conduction headphones for working from home
Shokz OpenComm 2 UC
Pros
Very good voice-calling performance
Retractable boom microphone
Includes USB dongle for wireless PC connection
IP55 splash-proof
Zoom certification
Cons
Proprietary magnetic charging (no USB-C)
Not great for music listening with poor bass performance
A few years ago Shokz turned its OpenRun (formerly Aeropex) bone-conduction headphones into a more communications-friendly headset with an integrated boom microphone called the OpenComm ($160), which remains available. The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but features an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition. Since these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York. While the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. However, they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.  As long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C. Battery life is rated at 16 hours of talk time and eight hours of listening.  ...

Best value Logitech wireless headset for working from home
Logitech Zone Vibe 100
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable wear
Auto-mute function with retractable boom microphone
Companion app allows for sound profile tweaking
Cons
No active noise canceling
Music listening is only OK on PC
There's a lot to like about Logitech's Zone Vibe 100 wireless over-ear headset, which comes in off-white, carbon and rose color options. For starters, it's lightweight and comfortable to wear, with a retractable boom microphone that you can flip up to mute, plus it has a mute button on it. Additionally, it features multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair it simultaneously with your Mac or Windows PC and your smartphone and easily switch audio back and forth between the two devices. These aren't active noise canceling headphones but they offer a decent amount of passive noise isolation. Battery life is rated at up 20 hours of listening time.People said I sounded clear on calls and there's some sidetone, so you can hear your voice in the headphones as you talk (that way you don't end up raising your voice two much). I thought they sounded quite good while listening to music on my smartphone. However, the sound quality wasn't quite up to the same level when streaming Bluetooth audio on my computer, though it was still decent. The Logi Tune app for iOS and Android does allow to tweak the sound profile, adjust the sidetone and set when the headset goes to sleep when not in use.This also comes in a version USB dongle for your computer called the Zone Vibe 125 for $30 more.  ...

Sony's previous generation flagship ANC headphones
Sony WH-1000XM5
9.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging
Excellent sound and noise canceling
Powered by Apple's H2 chip
Strong voice-calling performance
Cons
Basically the same design as the previous model
Murky support for high-resolution audio
Why I like themSony has released its new-for-2025 WH-1000XM6 headphones, but its former flagship model, the XM5 is still an excellent headphone that's often on sale for closer to $300. Their noise-canceling, voice-calling and sound isn't quite as good as what the XM6 offers (the XM6 sounds a little more detailed with improved bass performance) and the XM6 has a dual-hinge design that allows them to fold up, not just fold flat. As a result, the XM6's case is a little smaller. Additionally, the XM6 is powered by a new QN3 chip that Sony says delivers 7 times the performance of the QN1 chip found in the XM5s. All that said, while the jump in performance from the XM5 to the XM6 is certainly noticeable, it isn't huge; the XM5 still offers very good sound, noise-canceling and voice-calling performance that should satisfy most people. Read my Sony WH-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy the XM5 is if you can't afford the XM6 and find the XM5 substantially discounted. It's still quite competitive with the Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Sonos Ace and Apple's AirPods Max.
Reasons to skip/keep lookingIt's always a little hard to buy a previous-generation headphone that was released three years ago (2022) when you know a newer, better model (the XM6) exists and will eventually go on sale.

Best designed wireless headset from Logitech
Logitech Zone Wireless 2
Pros
Well-designed and comfortable
Mute button has been added to the boom microphone
Active noise canceling
Excellent noise reduction for calls
Multipoint bluetooth pairing
Cons
Could sound a little better for music listening
Somewhat pricey
Logitech's second-gen Zone Wireless 2 headset improves on the original with an upgraded design and performance. This is an on-ear model that competes with Jabra's Evolve2 65 Flex but is a bit heavier (230 grams) and has some metal parts (the headset feels both substantial and sturdy with a premium look). It is comfortable to wear for long periods with soft ear pads filled with high-quality memory foam. Like the Jabra, this Logitech has a retractable boom microphone with a mute button on it. It also has active noise cancellation and I thought it did a good job muffling external noise and reducing background noise when I was on calls. You can also toggle on a transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world. The headset is equipped with five microphones and uses Bluetooth 5.2 with a wireless range of 50 meters, which is much better than the typical 10-meter range of Bluetooth. Battery life is rated at up to 15 hours with noise canceling on and 18 hours with it off.People were impressed by how clear I sounded on calls, even when I tested the headset in the noisy streets of New York. Sound quality has also improved, and while this doesn't sound as good as Sony or Bose headphones, the sound quality for listening to music is quite respectable. It support the SBC, AAC and AptX audio codecs (Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex only supports SBC).The white version I tried was Microsoft Teams certified and came with a USB-A/USB-C Bluetooth dongle for computer use and a slim carry pouch. In all, this is a nice upgrade over Logitech's Zone Wireless Headset and a top headset.  ... Show more

Best compact headset
Jabra Evolve2 65 Flex
Pros
Very comfortable
Excellent sound and voice call performance
Auto-muting function with retractable boom microphone
Excellent connectivity options with Bluetooth 5.2 and included USB-A dongle
Cons
Only supports SBC audio codec
Not to be confused with the earlier Jabra Evolve2 65, the new-for-2023 Evolve2 65 Flex features a slimmer design with dual hinges that allows you to fold the headset up flat in its compact carrying case. While this is an on-ear headset, it has a nicely padded headband and ear pieces and is impressively comfortable (it also helps that it's relatively lightweight, weighing 136 grams or 4.8 ounces).I was impressed with the sound and performance of the Evolve2 65 Flex. It has a retractable boom microphone and good active noise canceling along with excellent noise reduction for calls (I made calls in the noisy streets of New York and callers said I sounded clear with little background noise intrusion). Flip the boom mic up and you automatically get muted during video conference calls; flip it down and you unmute yourself.With 28mm drivers, this headset also works well for listening to music and other audio, which is what you should expect for its high price tag. However, it only supports the SBC audio codec and not the superior AAC or AptX audio codecs (that's not the end of the world, but it is worth pointing out). Equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, you can connect it to a variety of devices wirelessly and the included Bluetooth USB-A dongle allows for easy pairing with PCs (you can connect it to two devices at the same time). Finally, battery life is rated at up to 21 hours with noise-canceling on and 32 hours with it off. That's decent for a compact headset.  ... Show more

Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging and dust-resistance
Excellent sound and noise canceling with improved acoustic architecture
Powered by Apple's H2 chip
Charging case has U1 chip and built-in speaker for Find My
Strong voice-calling performance
Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset
User-friendly controls on stem for audio control
Cons
No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices except headset
Still no XL tips included
No boom microphone
Apple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its iPhone 15 models, but it made the switch with the AirPods Pro (2nd gen). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro.Nevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple users despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.  ... Show more

Pros
Lightweight and very comfortable
New design is an upgrade
Excellent sound
Great noise canceling
New Immersive Audio with head-tracking offers some sound-quality enhancements
Voice-calling performance is top-notch
Cons
Higher price tag
No USB-C audio
Immersive audio mode hurts battery life
Why I like themBose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones feature a more premium design than their predecessor, along with Bose's Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also great for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. Released in late 2023, I called these "a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max headphones." Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones have edged slightly ahead of the QC Ultras, but they remain one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market. Read my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review.Reasons to buyThey're a good choice for frequent travelers, commuters and professionals who want comfortable, well-designed headphones with impressive overall performance, including excellent noise-muffling capabilities.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThose who are on a tighter budget should obviously look toward more midrange and budget headphones options. Also, Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones are arguably slightly better for around the same price. That said, since the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones came out in late 2023, they do end up going on sale fairly regularly.  ... Show more

Best value alternative to Jabra and Poly UC headsets
Cyber Acoustics Essential Bluetooth Headset HS-2000BT
Pros
Affordable
Lightweight and comfortable
Decent voice-calling performance with auto-mute feature
Active noise-canceling
USB Bluetooth dongle for PCs is included
Cons
Design is a little generic
While overall performance is decent, it's not as good as that of pricier models
No carrying case
UC headsets that include a USB dongle so you can easily connect the headset wirelessly to your computer tend to cost more than headsets that just feature Bluetooth connectivity. For around $70, the Cyber Acoustics Essential Bluetooth Headset HS-2000BT sells at a discount compared to similarly styled models from Jabra and Poly. I'm not going to say the HS-2000BT is better than those models, but it's lightweight and comfortable to wear and offers similar features, including a retractable boom microphone with automatic muting (when you retract the boom mic). It also has a couple of bonus features: active noise canceling and wireless charging (Qi wireless charging pad not included).Callers said I sounded good though not quite as clear as when I was using the Logitech Zone Vibe 100. I thought the HS-2000BT sounded decent enough when when listen to music, though the sound is on the warmer side (pushes the bass a bit). The headset is worth checking out, particularly if it goes on sale. I should also note that if you don't need the wireless connectivity, the headset is available in a wired-only version (the HS-2000) for $50.  ... Show more

Best headset from Poly for working from home
Poly Voyager Focus 2 UC
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable to wear
Stellar noise reduction and two levels of noise canceling for calls
Retractable boom microphone with mute button and auto-mute function
USB wireless adapter included for PCs
Superior wireless range with Bluetooth 5.1
Cons
Version with USB-C wireless dongle is more expensive
Music listening quality is only OK
More expensive than competitor options (though worth it)
Plantronics' original Voyager Focus UC has long been considered one of the best work-from-anywhere headsets. Now we get the Voyager Focus 2 UC from Poly (the company Plantronics morphed into after it acquired Polycom), and it's improved in several ways, including better noise reduction (it's stellar), two levels of active noise canceling, increased battery life (up to 19 hours with ANC off and 16 hours with it on) and superior wireless range with Bluetooth 5.1.You can pair the Voyager Focus 2 UC with your computer with the included USB dongle or your phone (or tablet) via Bluetooth. It can also connect to a desk phone if you want to bring it to the office. Also worth noting: The boom microphone has a mute button on it, but when you flip it up it also automatically mutes the microphone. The original Voyager Focus doesn't mute when you lift the boom microphone.The Focus 2 comes in several different versions, including USB-A and USB-C models and a version that's Microsoft Teams certified. You can get the headset by itself or in a bundle that includes a charging dock. All versions include a nice protective carrying pouch.The Voyager Focus 2 UC is expensive but offers excellent performance and is quite comfortable for an on-ear headphone. It also sounds good for music listening with nicely detailed sound and ample bass. It may not be quite up to the level of the Sony WH-1000XM5 for music, but it offers a nice music-listening experience for a work-centric headset.  ... Show more

Best Poly earbuds made for working from home
Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC
Pros
Touchscreen display embedded in charging case
Case plugs into the 3.5 mm port working as a Bluetooth transceiver
Strong voice-calling performance
Good sound quality and noise canceling
User-friendly and feature-packed companion app
Cons
Poor noise reduction in noisier environments
Like JBL's Tour Pro 2 earbuds, the Poly Voyager Free 60 Plus UC earbuds also have a touchscreen display embedded in their charging case. The display isn't quite as fancy as the one on the JBL case (it's mostly monochrome), but these are among the first earbuds to have a case with a mini control panel integrated into it. Additionally, the Free 60 Plus UC case also turns into a Bluetooth transceiver for inflight entertainment systems (you plug the case into the 3.5mm headphone port). I also liked how you can store the USB-A Bluetooth dongle in the charging case when you're not using it with your computer. Aside from the tricked out case, the bigl strengths of the Poly Voyager Free 60 are their comfortable fit, excellent voice-calling performance for video calls (they have 3-mic array in each bud), solid noice canceling and very good sound quality. Equipped with 10mm drivers, they might not offer quite as good sound quality for music as other premium earbuds in this price range, but there's good depth and punch to the bass, decent clarity and they have a pleasant sound profile overall. They support the AAC and AptX audio codecs as well as LC3 when making video calls, Poly says. Battery life is rated at up to 5.5 hours with noise canceling on. I was able to easily switch between using the buds with my computer (with the USB dongle) and my iPhone. While they worked well for making cell-phone calls indoors and outdoors in quieter environments, callers said they could hear a good amount of background noise when I was making calls in noisier environments. Poly says it's working to improve noise reduction for cell-phone calls with a firmware update later this year. The earbuds can be updated via the Poly Lens app for Desktop, iOS or Android that also features a variety of settings you can play around with.Note that these earbuds are available in a non-UC version with a standard charging case for lesser than $200.  ...

Pros
Lightweight and comfortable, weighing less than half a pound with faux-leather padding

Enhanced voice-calling performance with pair of beamforming microphones
Robust EQ settings in user-friendly companion app
Cons
No carrying case
Limited extra features, like ear-detection sensors
No LDAC audio codec support
Lacks extra sound clarity and depth
Why I like themSony's improved entry-level noise canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight (only 192 grams) and very comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised, as these headphones offer good overall tonal balance with punchy bass, decent clarity and a fairly wide soundstage (the headphones are suitable for a variety of music genres. They also offers decent noise canceling and good voice-calling performance.No, they don't sound as good or perform as well as Sony's WH-1000XM5 or new WH-1000XM6 headphones. But they sound more premium than they look -- and feel -- and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these frequently are discounted to closer to $100, which makes them a good value.Reasons to buyBudget-conscious buyers seeking Sony quality at an accessible price point will find these offer a significant step up from truly entry-level headphone options.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe main reason not get these is that you simply want a more premium noise-canceling headphone that not only offers better build quality but better overall performance along with more advanced features like ear-detection sensors, LDAC audio codec support and Sony's Quick Attention and Speak-To-Chat features. Sony also leaves out any sort of carrying case or pouch with these headphones, which is slightly disappointing.  ... Show more

Microsoft Teams-certified version available

If you're looking for a souped-up version of Jabra's Elite 85h headphones, which came out a few years ago, the Evolve2 85 offers even better telephony options along with a Unified Communications USB dongle for PCs. It has similar sound quality to the 85h, it has an updated audio chipset, a hideaway boom arm and two additional microphones (10 altogether, with the extra two in the boom arm) for noise reduction and picking up your voice. Its build quality is also a step up. A Microsoft Teams-certified version is available for those who need it. I found it comfortable to wear over several hours, and it offers an impressive 37 hours of battery life or slightly more than the Elite 85h.  ... Show more

Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)
Cons

Android users lose a couple of key features
People around you can hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up (they leak some sound)
If you're an Apple-centric person who works on a MacBook and also has an iPhone (and maybe an iPad), Apple's AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones allow you to easily connect to multiple Apple devices simultaneously (so long as you're signed into your iCloud account on all the devices) and switch between them. If you're on a Zoom teleconference and a call comes in on your iPhone, the AirPods Max automatically switch to the iPhone if you pick up the call.They sound great, and with all their microphones, they do an excellent job picking up your voice and reducing ambient noise. Aside from their high price, the other potential downside is their heavy weight. Although I found them comfortable, some people may have trouble with that.  ... Show more

Cons
No noise canceling
Sound quality is only OK
Known for its value headphones and earbuds, JLab offers a pair of on-ear headphones with an integrated boom microphone (it can be rotated up when just listening to music) and multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can connect them to your phone and computer simultaneously. JLab's Go Work headset may not be great, but it delivers better-than-expected performance for a modest price. They're also comfortable to wear with a lightweight design. You won't mistake these for premium headphones, but the build quality means that they are among the best headphones for work for around $50.Battery life is rated at up to 45 hours at moderate volume levels, and you can mute calls using the multifunction button (an LED lights up at the end of the boom mic when the call is muted). I wouldn't call the sound quality for music listening and the headset performance stellar, but it's decent, particularly for the price. For music listening, there's ample bass and clarity and a cable is included for wired use. The headphones charge via USB-C. Note that JLab also sells over-ear Go Work headphones that cost around $80 and do sound a little better.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when buying a headset
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on a new wireless headset. The quality of value-priced headsets continues to improve, so you can find good affordable headsets and headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $200 or more, and sometimes much more.Boom microphone or not?When a headphone has a boom microphone, that's when it technically becomes what we describe as a "headset." Many consumer headphones work well for making calls, having an extended microphone that sits closer to your mouth can improve how well your voice gets picked, making it sound clearer. When retracted, some boom microphones will mute the headset so people can't hear you. Some boom mics now feature mute buttons on them. This is an important feature for video calls where you want to easily mute and unmute yourself. The downside to having the boom microphone is that it makes you look like you're wearing a headset instead of headphones. That's a bit of a factor if you plan on wearing whatever you buy outside your home or office.Fit, aka comfortIt's key that the headset or headphones you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want a headset of headphones you can wear over the course of a day with minimal breaks.DurabilityYou want headset that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality.Return policyIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one. How we test headphones and headsets for working from home
We test headphones and headsets based on six key criteria. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.Design: Evaluating design, we assess not only how comfortable the headphones and headsets fit (their ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. When it comes to earbuds, we also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks as well as voice calls and comparing the headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.Noise canceling performance: We evaluate noise canceling performance by wearing headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they do at muffling not only street noise but people's voices.Extra features: Some great-sounding headphones and headsets aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. For home office headphones, Bluetooth multipoint pairing is an important feature (and other connectivity options such as an included Bluetooth dongle for easy pairing with a computer), as well as auto-muting the microphone. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user-friendly it is.Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices. We also evaluate how they perform on video-conferencing applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams.Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.

Is it important to get a headset with a retractable boom microphone?
The benefit of a boom microphone is that it extends out, which puts it closer to your mouth and makes picking up your voice easier. Some headphones and earbuds with beam-forming microphones do a very good job of picking up your voice, but a good boom microphone is often the superior option. The only downside is that unless it truly retracts and is able to blend into the headphone's design when retracted, it makes the headset less attractive as a standard headphone for mobile use.
Show more
Can I use a gaming headset as a home office headphone?
Yes. Many gaming headsets have retractable microphones and are designed for chatting online with fellow gamers. That makes them good for video-conferencing apps but not everybody likes how they appear wearing a gaming headphone for a business call.
Show more
Are headphones or earbuds better for working from home?
People tend to look better wearing small earbuds than full-size headphones. It's really just a matter of personal preference. The one downside to earbuds is that they usually have far less battery life than full-size headphones, so you'll probably have to charge them during a break to use them for an entire day.
