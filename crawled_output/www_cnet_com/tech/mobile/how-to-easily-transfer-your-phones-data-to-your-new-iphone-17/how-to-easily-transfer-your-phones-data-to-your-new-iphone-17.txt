You can safely get all your data onto your new iPhone without any hiccups. Jeff Carlson/CNET
Getting a new iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air or really any new-to-you iPhone is an exciting moment -- which is then interrupted by the annoyance of moving all of your information safely from the old phone to the new. Fortunately, it's easier than ever to shift data to a new iPhone from the phone you have now -- even if it's an Android model.I'm here to explain the four ways to easily transfer data from your old phone to your new iPhone.For more, explore a bunch of hidden iOS 26 features, and see just how thin the iPhone Air is.1. The convenient method: Restore from iCloudDuring the setup process, you'll be asked if you want to directly transfer apps and information from your old iPhone to your new one using Quick Start. This feature was first rolled out with iOS 12.4, so if it's been several years since you've upgraded phones, it'll be the first time you've seen the option. The easiest and quickest method to set up your new iPhone is to restore from a recent iCloud backup. As you walk through the initial setup process, tap Restore from iCloud Backup, sign in with your Apple Account (previously called Apple ID before iOS 18) and then pick the most recent backup of your old iPhone.  If the backup is more than a day or two old, take an extra few minutes to create a new backup. To do so, open the Settings app on your old phone, search for iCloud Backup in the Search field at the top of the screen and then click the matching result. Click Back Up Now to update the cloud backup.Once that finishes, go back to your new iPhone and select the backup you just created as what you want to use to restore from.  Your phone will then restore your settings and preferences, and you'll be able to start using it in about 15 minutes. It will continue downloading your installed apps in the background.  Once everything is restored, you'll need to sign back into any accounts you added to your phone, as well as go through your apps and make sure you're still signed in.
You've got several options when it comes to setting up your new iPhone. James Martin/CNET2. The speediest method: Apple direct transferIf you do not have a recent iCloud backup or your internet connection is slow, you can transfer everything from iPhone to iPhone, either wirelessly or via cable. When the Quick Start process asks for the source, choose the direct transfer option.Using a cable rated for fast data speeds, the process can be surprisingly swift, and is my preferred way to upgrade to a new iPhone. Connect both phones via the cable; note that you might need an adapter if your current phone is an iPhone 14 or earlier with a Lightning port. Apple has more details on how to make a wired transfer work.If you opt for the wireless route, make sure both phones are plugged in and charging to ensure they don't run out of battery, and that they are connected to your Wi-Fi network (it's part of the setup process on the new phone). And also make sure you have enough time for the process to finish -- it could take over an hour.The more information you have on your phone, like photos in your library, the longer it will take. When the transfer starts, the phones will show you a time estimate. Every time I've used this tool, that estimate has been accurate within a couple of minutes. It's worth taking the time if you don't use Apple's iCloud service to back up your phone.3. The longer, comprehensive method: Use a Mac or PCA longer but safer method is to restore from an encrypted backup using a Mac or PC. Not only does this process transfer all of your apps, settings and preferences, but it also means you don't have to sign into the countless apps you have on your phone.  Before you can use this method, you'll need to create an encrypted backup of your current iPhone. I know that may sound intimidating or overly complicated, but it only means you have to check an extra box and enter a password.  On a Mac, you'll use Finder to back up your old iPhone -- and make sure you take the steps to make an archive backup. Check the Encrypt backup box and enter a password you'll remember when prompted. Then let your Mac go to work, creating a backup file. It will let you know when it's done.
Restore your data from a backup of your old iPhone using your computer. Jeff Carlson/CNETOn a PC, you'll need to use iTunes (it's not completely dead) or the Apple Devices app to create a backup, as explained here. Again, you'll need to make sure the Encrypt backup box is checked and enter a password.  To restore your new phone, open Finder or iTunes, and connect your phone to your computer. Click Trust when prompted, and then follow the prompts, selecting the backup you just created as what you want to use to restore the phone. You will need to enter the backup's password before the process begins, so make sure you don't forget it. Once it's done, your new phone will be an exact copy of your old phone and you won't have to spend any time signing into apps or random accounts.  4. For Android users: Move to iOSApple doesn't have many Android apps listed in Google's Play Store, but Move to iOS is one of them. This free app will connect your Android phone to a new iPhone and allow you to transfer the most important information from one phone to the other.  Here's the entire step-by-step process, as well as some caveats, like the fact that it won't transfer any locally stored music or PDF files.
Apple made an Android app called Move to iOS that makes moving your messages, photos, videos and more from an Android phone to an iPhone easy. Patrick Holland/CNETApple said it has redesigned Move to iOS to make it faster and easier to migrate from your Android phone to your new iPhone. The company goes on to say it has sped up Wi-Fi migration with transfer speeds up to 5GHz, and you can use Wi-Fi on your iPhone to connect to your Android phone. You can also connect your Android phone to your new iPhone with a USB-C or USB-C to Lightning cable to move everything over more quickly, Apple said.No matter the process you used to set up your new phone, you're in for excitement and fun as you explore what it can do.
