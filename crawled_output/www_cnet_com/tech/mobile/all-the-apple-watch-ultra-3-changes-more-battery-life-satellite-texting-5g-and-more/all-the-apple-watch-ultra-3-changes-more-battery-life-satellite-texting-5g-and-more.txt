Apple/ Zooey Liao/CNET
Since its introduction, the Apple Watch Ultra has been the Apple smartwatch choice of long-distance runners, hikers, divers -- and less-energetic folks who just prefer a chunky watch with extended battery life. After releasing minimal updates for the last couple of years, Apple announced at its big fall event the new Apple Watch Ultra 3, which adds a brighter, larger display, 5G cellular communication, satellite connectivity, a battery life increase of up to 42 hours and the ability to detect whether you might be suffering from hypertension.

Though Apple Watch fans might still be satisfied with the Ultra 2 or the Apple Watch Series 10, the Ultra 3 is ready for those who want the most advanced smartwatch Apple has to offer.The Apple Watch Ultra 3 costs $799 (£749, AU$1,399), and preorders are now live. The first shipments and in-store availability will arrive on Sept. 19. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
New features of the Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple/Screenshot by CNET The Apple Watch Ultra 3 screen size is back on top The brilliant screen on the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is now slightly larger than its predecessor, at a 422x514-pixel resolution (up from the Ultra 2's 410x502 pixels), though the case itself hasn't expanded. Instead, Apple has slimmed the bezel to bring the active edge of the screen closer to the frame.  Speaking of the frame, it's now created using a 3D printing process that uses 100% recycled titanium and half the amount of raw materials as earlier generations.
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 at the Apple Sept. 9 event. Vanessa Hand OrellanaThe screen is also better than the Ultra 2, with an LPTO3 OLED always-on Retina display that has the same faster refresh rate introduced with the Series 10. That means you'll see a second hand that continually updates, or an active stopwatch timer, without having to raise your wrist and engage the screen. Screen brightness when viewing from an angle has also improved, according to Apple.
The bezels around the Apple Watch Ultra 3 screen are smaller than ever. Apple/Screenshot by CNET Even more battery life The Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2 boasted much longer battery stamina than the regular watch, thanks to their physically larger batteries: about 36 hours of regular use, or 72 hours with low power mode on.  With the Apple Watch Ultra 3, you might forget the last time you put it onto its charger. Its larger battery and improved battery life get up to 42 hours on a charge. Continuous workouts can extend to 20 hours in low power mode while retaining full GPS and heart rate readings. The Ultra 3 also joins the Series 10 and Series 11 by offering fast charging. Apple claims 45 minutes of charging will get the watch up to 80% full, or 75 minutes to top out at 100%. Since most people probably aren't going to run the watch down to zero, a more realistic circumstance is being able to pop it onto a charger for just 15 minutes and gain 12 hours of battery life. Apple says a number of factors contribute to the improved battery life in the Ultra 3: the more efficient display, larger battery and redesigned radios for 5G cellular and satellite communications. We expected a new processor as well, but surprisingly, the Ultra 3 is powered by the same S10 chip that runs the Apple Watch Series 11 and Series 10.
Three threes: a group of Apple Watch Ultra 3 watches at the Sept. 9 Apple event. Celso Bulgatti/CNET Connect to satellite services, even without an iPhone Most phones and smartwatches are designed with the expectation that they operate in areas where cellular or Wi-Fi networks are easily available. The Apple Watch Ultra almost expects you to get lost, with that larger battery and dual-GPS location tracking. But if something unfortunate happens while you're away from everything, you still want to be able to signal for help or keep friends alerted to your whereabouts.
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 now offers satellite SOS capabilities. Apple/Screenshot by CNETThe Ultra 3 now includes on-device satellite communication, which means as long as the watch has a view of the sky, it can connect to satellites. In most situations, you'd also have a satellite-capable iPhone with you, but that's not helpful if the phone's battery is drained. Apple says it redesigned the radios and antenna to double the signal strength.  As with the iPhone, Emergency SOS via satellite is free for two years, though Apple has not announced any pricing for the service since it was launched. Text messaging and Find My services via satellite are also available as long as you have an active cellular plan. As for cellular connections, all configurations of the Apple Watch Ultra include cellular capabilities, and now the Ultra 3 is capable of connecting to 5G networks. It uses 5G RedCap (for "reduced capacity") technology, which delivers 5G access but without the power requirements that a device such as the iPhone can handle easily.
Health and fitness features at the forefront As with the Apple Watch Series 11, the Ultra 3 also looks for possible hypertension, or high blood pressure, based on readings it takes during the course of a month. The hypertension detection feature was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration the day after it was announced, and it will be available in 150 countries and regions this month.That's in addition to existing heart rate and ECG measuring, as well as the ability to detect blood-oxygen levels, a feature that's been temporarily blocked in the US due to litigation (though Apple recently developed a workaround).  Apple also announced that the Sleep app will include a new Sleep Score feature to help users track and adjust sleep more easily.
A bike rider wears the new Apple Watch Ultra 3 Apple/Screenshot by CNETWhen Apple announced WatchOS 26 and iOS 26, it introduced Workout Buddy, a virtual companion that provides stats and encouragement while you're working out, such as on a bike ride, run or walk. (CNET's Vanessa Hand Orellana got details from Apple's team developing it.) As a watch designed for workouts, it's natural that the Apple Watch Ultra 3 brings Workout Buddy along for the ride/run/amble. Other health and workout features carry over from the Ultra 2, such as water resistance to 100m and scuba diving to 40m, IP6X dust resistance and durability in extreme temperature and altitude environments. It includes dual GPS (L1 and L5) radios for more precise location tracking and wayfinding.
