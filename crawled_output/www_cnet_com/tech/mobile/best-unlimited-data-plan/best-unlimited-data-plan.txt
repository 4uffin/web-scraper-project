No one wants to come up short on cellular data, whether you're streaming video, scrambling for a deadline or staying connected with family and friends. So it makes sense to get a cellular phone plan that offers unlimited data. But even unlimited plans turn out to have restrictions, which is why it's important to understand the details before signing up for any unlimited plan. We looked at data amounts, performance, pricing and perks to pick our recommended postpaid plans from three major carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. Our Picks

Unlimited phone plan FAQ
What is the best unlimited phone plan overall?We'd love to point to one plan and say, "Get this one," truly. But phone plans are designed to appeal to all kinds of people by offering all kinds of options. You might value price over perks if you just need a plan that will keep you connected at all times. Or maybe you're a frequent traveler and you want endless high-speed data and higher-resolution video streaming and are willing to pay for those features. Assuming network coverage is good-to-great -- which isn't a given, but for the sake of argument -- then cost becomes a major factor, in which case T-Mobile's Essentials plan delivers the basics at a good value. At the other end, T-Mobile's Experience More or Verizon's Unlimited Plus give you plenty of features without paying the full prices of their top plans. However, there's one thing to note about the most expensive plans: They often get the best trade-in or included device offers to entice customers to sign up for the most lucrative plans.Best unlimited data plans for a single line

T-Mobile Essentials Saver
Pros
T-Mobile's 5G network is generally robust
Plan includes 50GB of high-speed data in the US
Phone can be used as a hotspot
Unlimited calls, texts and data in Canada and Mexico
Cons
Data in Canada and Mexico limited to very slow 2G speeds
Hotspot is limited to 3G speeds
No five-year price guarantee
Everyone must be on the same plan
Taxes and fees aren't included in monthly cost
The T-Mobile Essentials Saver plan offers unlimited data usage and includes 50GB of "Premium" data, which is the fastest-capable 5G rate available in your area. After 50GB, speeds are reduced to 3G levels for the remainder of the month. However, that Premium may not always be so premium: T-Mobile notes in the fine print that "Essentials customers may notice speeds lower than other customers and further reduction if using >50GB/month, due to data prioritization."You can use your phone as a mobile hotspot, also with unlimited data, but at 3G speeds. High-speed hotspot access is available as an add-on. Internationally, calls, text and data are unlimited while in Canada and Mexico, but the data is restricted to 2G speeds. Elsewhere, calls cost 25 cents per minute and texts are unlimited at no extra charge when you're in roughly 215 countries.As for other T-Mobile features, you'll have to look further up the plan menu. Essentials Saver and Essentials don't carry the 5-year price guarantee found in the Experience plans, nor does it include T-Satellite texting access, but you can add the Starlink-based service as an optional add-on. Perks are also reserved for the costlier plans, which means no included Netflix, Apple TV Plus or Hulu streaming thrown in.The Essentials Saver plan costs $50 a month for a single line, $80 for two lines and $100 for three lines, the maximum number allowed on this plan. If you need three or more lines, the Essentials plan is a better value.Why we like itProviders want to push you toward their more expensive offerings, but they also know there's a place for cost-conscious people who want just the basics. Essentials Saver includes 50GB of fast data before the data rate slows down. And even though the hotspot feature is especially pokey at 3G speeds, it's still there in a pinch if needed.Who it's best forThe Essentials Saver plan is great for individuals or pairs who don't want to spend much for a cellular plan and aren't looking for perks or fast data.Who shouldn't get itThe plan isn't for people seeking features such as larger amounts of premium data, regular hotspot access or included perks, or folks who need to set up a family or group with three or more lines.Customer service options• Online: T-Mobile• Phone: 1-855-315-6244• Store: Store locator• App: T-Life app  ...

Pros

Cons
No control over whether data speeds will slow if network is busy
No hotspot data

Taxes and fees aren't included in monthly cost
The AT&T Value Plus VL is a mouthful of a name, but it can be a good option if you're looking for a single affordable line that doesn't offer many extras. It offers unlimited 5G talk, text and data without a limit on how much high-speed data you can use before being throttled. The caveat is that AT&T can slow data speeds "if the network is busy," which means you're at the whim of the network when it comes to getting in the fast lane. The plan allows up to 10 lines on an account, but everyone has to be on the same plan. AT&T's other unlimited plans allow for each person to choose which level they need.When traveling in Canada or Mexico, you get unlimited text, talk and data, but the data is transmitted at just 2G speeds when "off net," or using a nonprimary carrier network. Texting from the US to over 200 countries is unlimited.There are also no other perks other than AT&T's ActiveArmor security service for blocking unwanted calls and for extra data security, but on Value Plus VL that feature is limited.The plan isn't easily located on AT&T's site: Though Value Plus VL is an unlimited plan, AT&T doesn't list it with the more expensive unlimited plans on its Wireless Plans page; click More Plans to reveal it.Why we like itAT&T Value Plus VL is affordable, especially with just one line, and you can scale up to 10 lines if needed.Who it's best forSingle-line customers in solid AT&T coverage areas who don’t want data speed limits but aren’t worried if the speed fluctuates.Who shouldn't get itIf you’re in a group of two or more lines, each person will need to be on this same plan, so look elsewhere.Customer service options• Online: AT&T Wireless support • Phone: 800-331-0500• Store: Store locator• App: myAT&T iOS, Android  ...

Pros
T-Mobile's 5G network is generally robust
Plan includes 50GB of high-speed data in the US
Phone can be used as a hotspot
Unlimited calls, texts and data in Canada and Mexico
Can have up to six lines on an account
Third line free is a better deal than Essentials Saver
Cons

Taxes and fees aren't included in monthly cost
If you compare the specifics of T-Mobile's Essentials and Essentials Saver plans, you might think the company forgot to update one or the other -- they're Essential-ly the same. With both, you get 50GB of fast Premium 5G data (depending on the network capabilities in your area), which drops to 3G speeds of still-unlimited data after that allotment is used up. You can use your phone as a mobile hotspot with unlimited data, but only at 3G speeds and restricted to paltry 2G speeds when you're in Canada or Mexico. In those two countries, calls, text and data are unlimited, while calls made from around 215 other countries are charged at 25 cents a minute.The Essentials plan also doesn't include perks such as streaming video from Netflix or Apple TV Plus, nor the five-year price guarantee found on the Experience More and Experience Beyond plans. T-Satellite service is also not included, though it can be added for $10 a month.Where Essentials comes out ahead of Essentials Saver is the number of lines you can have on your account. Essentials Saver is limited to just three, but Essentials can accommodate six lines. In fact, a trio of people will save money going with Essentials due to a free third-line deal, paying $90 a month (plus taxes and fees) for a $10 savings over Essentials Saver.However, if you need just one or two lines, Essentials Saver is still the better deal. A single line on Saver is still the better offer at $50 a month compared with $60 for the same features on Essentials, and two lines on Saver costs $80 a month compared with $90 for Essentials.Why we like itYou get a solid level of basic phone service, with unlimited calls, texts and data, 50GB of premium higher-speed data and better pricing than the Essentials Saver plan for three or more lines (up to six).Who it's best forEssentials is great for a cost-conscious family of three or more that wants unlimited everything, even at some slower speeds.Who shouldn't get itThis plan isn’t for people who want features such as larger amounts of premium data, regular hotspot access or included perks, or folks who need to set up a family or group with three or more lines.Customer service options• Online: T-Mobile• Phone: 1-855-315-6244• Store: Store locator• App: T-Life app  ...

Verizon Unlimited Welcome
Pros
Verizon's 4G LTE network is a strong backbone
Can still get perks
Can mix and match plans
Three-year price guarantee
Cons
No access to Verizon's fastest 5G networks
No hotspot data included
Verizon's Unlimited Welcome sounds like the happiest greeter in your favorite store or restaurant. And if you're looking for a bare-bones plan with just the basics, it has some compelling aspects. At the top of that list is how modular Verizon's plans are. Each person on an account can pick a different plan that suits them (unlike T-Mobile and AT&T, which require everyone to share the same plan at this comparative entry level). And whereas other providers reserve perks such as streaming services for the higher-tier plans, you can add them piecemeal to customize what you need -- typically for $10 a month for each, depending on the service.That applies to mobile hotspot data: By itself, the plan offers no way to wirelessly share your cellular connection from your phone, but for an additional $10 you can add 100GB of data.International options include unlimited talk and text in Canada and Mexico and 2GB of high-speed data before ratcheting down to unlimited data at 3G speeds.However, the Unlimited Welcome plan isn't as welcome when it comes to 5G data speeds. It can only tap into regular low-band 5G. Even if you had a capable device and were within range of a midband or millimeter wave 5G signal, you wouldn't be able to take advantage of Verizon's fastest 5G Ultra Wideband ("5G UW" or "5G UWB") speeds.Why we like itThere's no set amount of high-speed data before a line is throttled, so you don't need to keep an eye on your data usage -- but at the same time, this plan only supports 5G, not 5G Ultra Wideband. We also like that each person on a Verizon account can have their own plan with different perks. In a family, for example, an adult could add hotspot data (for an extra $10), but it can be left off for a child who doesn’t need it, even if both of them are on Unlimited Welcome.Who it's best forFamilies who want to keep costs low but still have options for some perks.Who shouldn't get itAnyone who wants to connect at higher 5G speeds and take advantage of the capabilities they paid for when buying a phone.Customer service optionsOnline: VerizonPhone: 800-922-0204Store: Store locatorApp: My Verizon  ...

Verizon makes the pricing complicated on its website
When it comes to perks like streaming services and other extras, two plans run neck and neck: Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome and T-Mobile’s Experience More. We give Verizon a slight edge thanks to its modular approach to customizing perks -- even if each one comes as a separate paid add-on. When we specced out the two plans with similar offerings, the cost was about the same. While other providers tend to reserve perks like streaming services for higher-tier plans, Verizon’s Unlimited Welcome lets you add them individually to suit your needs -- typically for $10 a month each, depending on the service. That includes a Disney Plus, Hulu and ESPN Plus bundle (with ads); Netflix and Max bundle (with ads); and a family subscription to Apple One (for $20). Although it feels like annoying upselling, you get to pick and choose which ones you want. You can toggle perks on or off anytime -- or skip them altogether. You can even add multiple perks to a single line if you choose.That add-on approach applies to mobile hotspot data, too. By itself, the plan offers no way to wirelessly share your cellular connection from your phone, but for an additional $10 you can add 100GB of data.International options include unlimited talk and text in Canada and Mexico and 2GB of high-speed data before ratcheting down to unlimited data at 3G speeds.Each person on an account can pick a different plan that suits them (unlike T-Mobile and AT&T, which require everyone to share the same plan at this comparative entry level). From a perks perspective, for example, that means one person who travels frequently could add the 3 TravelPass Days option ($10) to their line. Some perks, such as Apple Music Family, are added to the cost of one line and the benefit is shared by up to five family members. (Each perk has its own restrictions, so be sure to read the details carefully.)However, the Unlimited Welcome plan isn't as welcome when it comes to 5G data speeds: It can only tap into regular low-band 5G. That means that even if you had a capable device and were within range of a midband or millimeter wave 5G signal, you wouldn't be able to take advantage of Verizon's fastest 5G Ultra Wideband ("5G UW" or "5G UWB") speeds.Why we like itThere's no set amount of high-speed data before a line is throttled, so you don't need to keep an eye on your data usage -- but at the same time, this plan only supports 5G, not 5G Ultra Wideband. We also like that each person on a Verizon account can have their own plan with different perks.

Runner-up plan for perks
T-Mobile Experience More
Pros
T-Mobile has a strong 5G network
Free T-Satellite service through end of 2025 (then $10/mo)
5-year price guarantee
Solid perks like Netflix, Apple TV Plus and international data
Cons
T-Satellite not included in the plan price starting 2026
Taxes and fees not included in monthly cost
T-Mobile’s Experience More plan sits in the middle of its unlimited plans, but is actually quite a jump above the more value-focused Essentials and Essentials Saver plans. It includes unlimited high-speed data over its 5G network, so you don’t need to worry about whether performance will lag after you’ve used up an initial amount (although T-Mobile does reserve the right to slow data when networks are congested). It also includes 60GB of high-speed hotspot data (then unlimited at 3G speeds once that’s used up).The Experience More plan also carries T-Mobile’s five-year price guarantee. The T-Satellite feature for texting via satellite when you’re away from a cellular network is not included in the plan, but it can be added as a free service through the end of 2025; after that date, it will cost $10 a month.Internationally, Experience More includes unlimited talk and text while traveling in Canada and Mexico, plus 15GB of high-speed data (then unlimited at 256Kbps). In more than 215 other countries outside the US, you get unlimited texting and 5GB of high-speed data (then unlimited at 256Kbps), plus calling charged at 25 cents per minute.The Experience More plan also includes a few attractive perks above the 5G and data speed allotments. Included in the price are Netflix Standard (with ads) and Apple TV Plus, which includes the MLS Season Pass, at 4K resolution where available. A one-year AAA membership can also help when you’re traveling. T-Mobile’s Magenta Status adds even more perks, such as 15% discounts on Hilton hotel stays, 25% off tickets to “more than 8,000 shows at over 120 venues nationwide,” and T-Mobile Tuesdays, a series of deals that can include perks like cheap movie tickets and discounts at national restaurants.Why we like itAlthough it’s more expensive, Experience More packs a lot of perks into one plan. Unlimited high-speed data means you don’t need to monitor your app and streaming usage.Who it’s best forIndividuals and families who want to get the most for their monthly cost.Who shouldn’t get itPeople looking to pay less per month who don’t need hotspot data or a multitude of perks.Customer service options• Online: T-Mobile• Phone: 1-855-315-6244• Store: Store locator• App: T-Life app  ...

Recent updates
T-Mobile shook up its plans (again) in early 2025, replacing its Go5G Plus and Go5G Next plans with Experience More and Experience Beyond. And yet, the stalwart Essentials and Essentials Saver plans are still in the lineup as lower-cost alternatives to the bells-and-whistles Experience plans.Since we updated this guide, Verizon has added a three-year price guarantee to its plans.We also added a new category -- best plans for perks -- highlighting a top pick and a runner-up based on the variety of add-ons, like streaming services, designed to attract customers. Factors to consider
A wireless carrier saying it offers 5G is like me saying I have a car. Good for me -- but what make and model is it? Does it run reliably? Can it actually get up to the top speed on the speedometer or will it sputter when I try to merge onto the freeway? And could I have gotten the same performance if I'd paid less for a model without extras like heated seats and a TruCoat sealant?As you're evaluating carriers, keep the following things in mind.
Emergency SOS might be one of the most important features to come out on any phone this year. Kevin Heinz/CNETKnow your areaWireless coverage can make or break a plan. If you aren't getting reliably fast connections, or if calls often drop or aren't picked up, then you could be paying for more than you're getting. Fortunately, most areas of the US are blanketed by some type of cellular coverage, so there aren't as many dead zones as there used to be. (And now satellite service is starting to fill those holes.) The major companies are also putting a lot of money and effort into broadening their coverage.On the other hand, even in a dense area, one carrier's network may be stronger than another's, or signals could be reduced due to interference. So the best approach is to ask friends or family members which services they use and if the quality is acceptable. You can also test-drive services to see how your devices work in your area. (See the FAQ below for more on how reliable coverage maps can be.)Know your deals and discountsOne other thing to keep in mind: discounts. All the carriers offer additional discounts you could be eligible for, depending on your employer, military status, student status or age.First responders, military members, veterans, nurses and teachers can get discounts on every major carrier. Verizon has discounts for students, while T-Mobile's Work perk could knock 15% off the monthly price of an Experience More or Experience Beyond plan, with AT&T offering a similar program for its Unlimited Premium PL plan. AT&T also has a promotion for teachers that offers 25% off its latest unlimited plans.If you're 55 or older, you may also be eligible for a discounted plan: T-Mobile offers discounted plans nationwide for as low as $55 a month for two lines, and Verizon and AT&T offer similar options but only for Florida residents. It's also worth noting that on their websites, some carriers sometimes advertise different rates geared toward switchers, for example if you bring your own phone (not trade in and finance a new one on an installment plan). Our recommendations reflect the actual rate outside of these very specific promotions. How we test
Picking a wireless plan and carrier is a very individualized process. What works for you and your family's needs may be vastly different from what your friends or neighbors are looking for. Even geographically, some areas have better AT&T coverage while others work best on Verizon or T-Mobile. The picks we make are based on more than a decade of covering and evaluating wireless carriers, their offerings and overall performance. Specifically, we take into account coverage, price/value and perks.
Getty ImagesCoverageSince all three major providers cover most of the country with good 4G LTE or 5G, this is largely a toss-up on a macro level. It's why we recommend a variety of eSIM options for figuring out what works best for you in your particular location, so you can best decide what's right for you. Looking at coverage maps on each provider's website will likely show that you get good coverage even if your experience isn't full bars or the fastest speeds. Price/valueValue is factoring in the total experience you might get, such as how much high-speed data you get and what's included in the sticker price. We also take into account whether a plan includes typical taxes and fees, or whether those are charged separately, inching your monthly bill higher.PerksPerks are add-ons beyond the core components of wireless service (talk, text and data). This could range from bundling in or discounting on streaming services to extra hotspot data or the ability to use your phone internationally.

What to know about 5G
"5G" is an umbrella term that encompasses the current fifth-generation cellular wireless network technologies. All the major carriers and phones support 5G connections, which can offer faster data speeds than older technologies such as 4G LTE or 3G.Essentially there are three types of 5G: Millimeter-wave (mmWave), which can be fast but has limited range; low-band 5G, which has slower speeds but works on a broader range; and midband, which is a balance between the two that's faster than low-band but also covers a larger range than millimeter-wave. Midband also incorporates C-band, a batch of spectrum auctioned off by the Federal Communications Commission in 2021.Your phone's 5G connection depends on which type blankets the area you're in, as well as other factors, such as population density and infrastructure. For instance, mmWave is super fast, but its signals can be thwarted by buildings -- or glass, or leaves -- or whether you're inside a structure.When your device is connected to a 5G network, it can show up as several variations such as 5G, 5G Plus, 5G UW or others, depending on the carrier. Here’s a list of icons you see at the top of your phone for the major services:AT&T: 5GE (which isn't actually 5G, but rather a sly marketing name for 4G LTE), 5G (low band), 5G Plus (mmWave, midband)Verizon: 5G (low band, also called "Nationwide 5G"), 5G UW/5G UWB (midband and mmWave, also called "5G Ultra Wideband")T-Mobile: 5G (low band), 5G UC (midband and mmWave, also called "Ultra Capacity 5G")

How reliable are coverage maps?
The three major companies in the US -- AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon -- offer services directly and have robust nationwide networks that offer 4G LTE (fast) and 5G (even faster) data. They all promise coverage that blankets most of the US, and they're actively trying to build up 5G coverage everywhere they can.But maps are one thing; experience is another. That’s why it's impossible to say that one carrier is objectively better than another. For example, T-Mobile's service in New York may be excellent, but Verizon is more reliable in rural Iowa. Or you may have basic 5G coverage but not faster millimeter wave 5G.If possible, ask neighbors, friends or family near you about which carriers they use and how fast or reliable the wireless service is. And don't forget to take into consideration not just where you live, but the places you frequent: Your house might get a clear connection, but your workplace could be in a cellular black hole.You may also be able to test-drive a network -- go to a carrier's store and ask if there are free ways to try out the company's service. T-Mobile offers a free three-month Network Pass, Verizon has a 30-day "trial" program, and AT&T has its own 30-day eSIM free trial program.

Why consider an unlimited plan?
Unlimited plans were once rarities, but now nearly all plans -- especially postpaid plans -- offer unlimited data. If you're on T-Mobile, all your plans are unlimited, and Verizon no longer lets new users sign up for a shared data plan. Only AT&T still offers some tiered data plans where the flow of data stops when you've reached the limit.Though everyone's wireless needs are different, we think unlimited plans are the best option for most phone users, especially when it comes to choosing a new plan. For example, the AT&T 4GB plan isn't great. It has a 4GB per line plan that runs $50 a month for one line ($160 for four lines). Each line here gets 4GB of data, but if you go over that threshold in a month, you're paying $10 for every 2GB. AT&T's plan also doesn't include access to its 5G networks. The company's basic unlimited plan, Unlimited Starter, is $65 a month for one line or $140 for four lines.If you have one or two lines and don't use a lot of data, you may be fine with one of these plans, though if you have just one line, we'd recommend switching over to AT&T's $51 per month Value Plus VL or T-Mobile's Essentials Saver. Two lines of that T-Mobile plan run $80 a month, which is still $10 cheaper than two lines of AT&T's 4GB plan and you won't have to worry about how much data you're using. For most people, we really do believe, unlimited is the best choice when choosing a new plan.

Is unlimited data really unlimited?
It is, but the speeds you get may vary depending on your plan and how much data you use in a given month.To experience data slowdowns on most of the plans mentioned above, you will need to have: 1. Used over 50GB of data in a month.2. Be in an area that's experiencing "congestion," "heavy traffic" or a "busy" network. Examples of this could be at a sporting event or concert where there are tens of thousands of people in the same area uploading and sharing photos and videos.All carriers say that in these cases your data should be slowed only "temporarily." If you have an older unlimited plan, your threshold for when your data slows and how long it lasts may be different.

Is hotspot included?
A hotspot, or the ability to share your phone's connection with other devices, will vary based on the plan you have. Some, like AT&T's Value Plus VL and Verizon's Unlimited Welcome, don't include it at all, while others -- such as AT&T's Unlimited Starter and T-Mobile's Essentials -- offer limited amounts of high-speed access before capping your hotspot performance to "3G" or "2G" speeds. In short, if hotspot access is important to you, check out a pricier unlimited plan, such as T-Mobile's Experience More (60GB of high-speed data) or Experience Beyond (250GB of high-speed data); Verizon's Unlimited Plus (30GB of high-speed data) or Unlimited Ultimate (200GB of high-speed data); or AT&T's Unlimited Extra EL (30GB of high-speed data) or Unlimited Premium PL (60GB of high-speed data) options.
