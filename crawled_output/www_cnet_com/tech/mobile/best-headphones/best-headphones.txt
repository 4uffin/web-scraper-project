How we test
What to consider
Budget
It's important to know how much you want to spend before you start researching. A quick tip -- consider the price-to-performance ratio rather than just the lowest price.
Noise cancellation
If you know you'll be listening in busier environments, look for headphones with active noise cancellation, or ANC.
Features
Today's headphones are often jam-packed with features that can make a huge difference in your listening habits. Consider how you plan to use your headphones and choose the features best suited to your needs.
Durability
You want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that I note have sturdy build quality.
Form factor
The physical design of your headphones can have a major impact on your listening experience -- in-ear, over-ear and on-ear designs each have their pros and cons depending on your listening habits. Connection type can make a big difference, too, with wired or wireless connectivity options impacting sound quality and portability.
Return policy
It's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they break or aren't a good match for you and your listening needs.

Headphones FAQ
What are the best headphones overall? With so many different great headphones, it's hard to declare one model better than all the others. That said, the new Sony WH-1000XM6 received a CNET Editors' Choice award in May of 2025 and sits at the top of this list, making it our current pick for best overall wireless noise-canceling headphone. While we have a few wired headphones on this list, if sound quality is your biggest priority and you're OK with a strictly corded headphone, check out more standout wired options our list of best wired headphones for audiophiles. Our top wired picks include the Sony MDR-M1 and the Sennheiser HD 505.What we updated: August 2025We added the Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANC and moved the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds to the "Other top wireless earbuds we've tested" section, as Bose has released the improved QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen).

SCORE
Pros
Upgraded design with more comfortable fit
Improved noise canceling and sound quality

Cons

It's not so clear how you access spatial audio
Over the last several years, Sony has made some of the best noise-canceling headphones on the market, so it's a big deal when the company comes out with a new flagship model, like the WH-1000XM6, which arrives three years after the release of the WH-1000XM5. Though the XM5 was -- and still is -- one of the top over-ear Bluetooth headphones, there's always room for improvement. With the XM6, Sony has fixed the small design flaws of its predecessor while bumping up the overall performance. The result is a headphone that's arguably edged just ahead of the competition and is now at the top of its class. Read my WH-1000XM6 review.Reasons to buyThe WH-1000XM6 are excellent for frequent travelers, remote workers and commuters who demand top-tier sound quality, noise canceling and call quality in a comfortable headphone. If you can afford the high price, you'll appreciate what Sony has achieved here.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you're budget-conscious or already own Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones, you should hold off until they go on sale. They offer some significant improvements over the XM5s, but not enough to justify rushing to upgrade at full price.

9.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lightweight, comfortable design with dual-hinges that fold both up and flat
New Immersive Audio with head-tracking offers a wider, more spacious soundstage for excellent sound quality
Top-notch noise canceling
Excellent voice-calling performance with minimal background noise
Intuitive mix of physical buttons and touch controls
Cons
Pricey
No USB-C audio for wired listening
Immersive audio mode hurts battery life (24 to 18 hours)
Limited 3-band equalizer in companion app
Why I like themBose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones have a more premium design than their predecessor, along with Bose's Immersive Audio feature, which delivers some sound-quality enhancements. Along with excellent sound and great noise canceling, the QC Ultra Headphones are also great for making calls, with top-notch background noise reduction. Released in late 2023, I called these "a worthy adversary to Sony's highly rated WH-1000XM5 and Apple's AirPods Max headphones." Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones have edged slightly ahead of the QC Ultras, but they remain one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market. Read my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones review.Reasons to buyThey're a good choice for frequent travelers, commuters and professionals who want comfortable, well-designed headphones with impressive overall performance, including excellent noise-muffling capabilities.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThose who are on a tighter budget should obviously look toward more midrange and budget headphones. Also, Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones are arguably slightly better for around the same price. That said, since the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones came out in late 2023, they do go on sale fairly regularly.  ... Show more

Best high-end wireless headphones for Apple users
Apple AirPods Max
8.9
/10
SCORE
Pros
Surprisingly comfortable for their weight (0.85 pounds) thanks to mesh canopy headband design a good weight distribution
Impressive sound quality with tight bass, natural mids, crisp highs and a wide soundstage
Excellent noise-canceling and a top-notch transparency mode that sounds very natural
They now offer USB-C audio for wired listening
Very good voice-calling performance
Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a nice bonus feature
Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)
Well-implemented digital crown for volume and playback control
Cons
Quite expensive and fairly heavy
Purse-like case is weird looking and doesn't offer as much protection as it should
No 3.5mm cable included for wired use on planes (optional cable costs $39)
Android users lose several key features
Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2
Why I like themIn late 2024, Apple updated the AirPods Max with USB-C charging -- instead of Lightning -- and added new color options but didn't upgrade the headphones in any other ways that we're aware of. Yes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max deliver impressive sound quality, excellent noise canceling, very good voice-calling performance, as well as high-end build quality (aluminum ear cups and stainless steel telescoping arms) and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature with head tracking. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, though I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. It's also worth noting that Apple enabled USB-C audio for the AirPods Max in March of 2024. Read my review of the original Lightning-enabled AirPods Max.What that means is that you can use the included USB-C charging cable to connect the headphones to your USB-C-equipped PC, phone or tablet to get lossless audio (the sound quality is slightly improved with wired listening, especially if you're listening to lossless audio files). While Apple doesn't include a USB-C-to-3.5mm cable -- yes, such a cable should be included with headphones that cost this much -- it will sell you one for $39.Reasons to buyYes, they're pricey, but the AirPods Max remain top-notch noise-canceling headphones that are right there with Sony's and Bose's flagship models. Like other AirPods, they have some Apple-only only features, including spacial audio with head-tracking and automatic switching between Apple devices, that Apple users will appreciate.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile the AirPods Max were updated with USB-C connectivity, which has some advantages, they haven't been substantially upgraded since their release in 2020. I'd like to see them at least updated with Apple's more powerful H2 chip (they're equipped with the H1 chip) that delivers some additional features and is available in the AirPods Pro 2. Could we get an AirPods Max 2 in 2026? Maybe.  ... Show more

Best designed new noise-canceling headphones
Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Eye-catching, premium design is made out of premium material and is slightly slimmer and lighter
Upgraded ear pads for more comfortable fit
Upgraded biocellulose drive units powered by discrete amplifier improves the sound quality
Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with 8 microphones
USB-C audio for lossless wired connection
Cons
Premium price ($50 more expensive than PX7 S2)
Noise canceling isn't quite up to the level of Sony's and Bose's
Headphones fold flat but not up (no dual-hinge)
At default setting, treble may be a touch too aggressive (forward) for some folks
Why I like themBowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 technically aren't the company's flagship headphones (the PX8 are), but they're arguably better than the more expensive PX8s, offering improved sound quality and superior noise canceling in an upgraded, slimmer design (300 grams) that fit my head more comfortably. The drivers aren't the same as the PX8's carbon cone drivers, but the redesigned 40mm biocellulose drive units have an improved chassis, voice coil, suspension and magnet that, according to B&W, deliver "lower coloration and distortion, improved resolution and superior dynamics." Additionally, for the first time in a pair of B&W headphones, the drive units are powered by a dedicated, discrete headphone amplifier that provides more "scale and energy to the sound." I did think their sound was more revealing and open compared to the earlier S2e, and they are more exciting and fun to listen to. At the default setting, the treble may be a touch aggressive for some folks (a tad too much sizzle), which can lead to some listening fatigue. But you can play around with the five-band equalizer in the companion app for iOS and Android to smooth things out and give the headphones a slightly warmer sound.While they are pricey, at least they look like premium headphones and are made with premium materials. In my tests in the noisy streets of New York, I found that the noise canceling is significantly improved (it's better than PX8's), though it's not quite up to the level of what you get with Sony's and Bose's flagship noise canceling headphones. I also thought the voice-calling performance has been upgraded (the headphones have eight microphones total, four in each ear cup).While callers said that the background noise reduction wasn't quite as good as what they heard when I was talking to them on Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, they said they could hear my voice well with minimal background noise.It's also worth noting that these headphones have USB-C audio for a lossless wired connection (and they also come with a 3.5mm analog cable that stows away nicely in a compartment inside the headphone's hard case). Android users should note that they have support for Qualcomm's aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless audio codecs that can help improve sound quality when listening wirelessly over Bluetooth to high-resolution tracks from music streaming services like Tidal, Amazon and Qobuz. However, very few mainstream Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive or Lossless (more support Sony's LDAC audio codec).Reasons to buyThe sleekly designed, swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX7 S3 are excellent noise-canceling headphones that are a clear improvement over their predecessor. That said, the biggest reason to buy these over Sony's WH-1000XM6 headphones, which carry the same list price, is that you like their look better. They also feature USB-C audio, while the XM6 don't.Reason to skip/keep lookingFrom an aesthetic standpoint, I prefer the design of the PX7 S3 to the Sony WH-1000XM6. But I can't say the PX7 S3 are any more comfortable or sound better (I slightly preferred the sound of the Sony, in fact). The Sonys offer slightly better noise canceling and voice-calling performance, along with some extra features such as Speak-to-Chat and Quick Attention mode. If you already own the earlier PX7 S2e, it's probably not worth shelling out full price for PX7 S3. The same is true if you own Bowers & Wilkins' flagship PX8, which could get the S2 treatment in 2025. The PX7 S3 sounds more exciting than the PX8, but it's debatable whether it sounds better. I would give the slight nod to the PX8 but that's just my personal taste.  ... Show more

Best noise-canceling headphones from Skullcandy
Skullcandy Aviator 900 ANC
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Relatively lightweight and comfortable
Not only fold flat but fold up into a nicely designed crossbody travel bag
Very good sound after tweaking EQ settings
Well-designed physical controls
Good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
THX spatial audio with head tracking
Strong battery life (up to 50 hours with ANC on)
Cons
No USB-C audio
Fairly pricey
No support for LDAC and AptX audio codecs (AAC and SBC only)
Why I like themWe reviewed Skullcandy's wired Aviator Roc Nation headphones all the way back in 2011. Now Skullcandy's brought the Aviator design back in a wireless noise-canceling model called the Aviator 900 ANC headphones. They kind of surprised me because Skullcandy is better known for its Crusher headphones, which deliver bone-rattling bass but not so-called premium-sounding headphones. However, the Aviator 900, developed in partnership with THX, deliver surprisingly impressive sound. They're not so great out of the box, but after you make some tweaks to the EQ in the app and turn on the THX spatial audio, the sound improves dramatically and is arguably more exciting than the new Nothing Headphone (1)'s sound and more fun to listen to.Like the Nothing Headphones (1), the Aviator 900 ANC also list for $300 and have a translucent theme. However, the Aviator 900 is lighter (289 grams) and more comfortable to wear. Plus, it not only folds flat but folds up into a well-designed crossbody travel bag (you can remove the strap) and has some nifty physical control buttons (I also liked the integrated mini LED display, though it's value is dubious because you can't see it while you have the headphones on). It, too, features good noise-canceling and voice-calling performance, though the Nothing Headphone (1) may have a slight edge in those departments. Even so, I slightly preferred Skullcandy headphones for their fit and sound, especially after a firmware upgrade fixed an early issue that some people experienced with the sound distorting at higher volumes.Reasons to buyThe Aviator 900 ANC headphones offer a comfortable fit and strong overall performance in a unique, eye-catching design. They also seem to regularly go on sale for $200, which makes them significantly more affordable than the Sony WH-1000XM6 and other premium noise-canceling headphones.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe headphones are fairly pricey, so you may want to wait for them to go on sale. They've dipped to as low as $200 during Amazon Prime Day, and I suspect we'll see them sporadically discounted to near $200 as we head into the holiday buying season.  ... Show more

Sonos' answer to the AirPods Max
Sonos Ace
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Sleek, sturdy design and comfortable fit
Excellent sound quality with rich, well-balanced audio
Very good noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance with effective background noise reduction
Spatial audio with head-tracking for both iOS and Android
USB-C audio for digital lossless wired connection
TV Audio Swap feature for Sonos users
Cons
Premium price point
Not true Wi-Fi headphones despite having Wi-Fi chip
TV Audio Swap feature only works with Sonos' Arc sound bar at launch (and can be glitchy)
Why I like themA lot of people expected Sonos' first headphones to be able to stream lossless audio over Wi-Fi in your home and then use Bluetooth outside your Sonos home network. However, Sonos reps told me that listening to music over Wi-Fi would greatly reduce the headphone's battery life and the company opted to leave that feature off. So even though they're equipped with a Wi-Fi chip so you can tap into a Sonos sound bar at home for private late-night viewing (Sonos refers to this as the TV Audio Swap feature), they're not really Wi-Fi headphones and are first and foremost noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones -- and I was mostly impressed by them. Read my Sonos Ace review.Sleekly designed, at 312 grams, they're not as light as the 254-gram Sony WH-1000XM6s or the 253-gram Bose QuietComfort Ultras, but they're considerably lighter than the 385-gram AirPods Max and I found them quite comfortable to wear, with a relatively small gap between the headband and my head (they hugged my head nicely with just the right amount of clamping). I also appreciated that their chrome metal yoke allows the headphones to swivel in multiple directions -- the hinge is hidden -- and the ear cups adhere magnetically like they do on the AirPods Max and are replaceable, which is good.All in all, the Sonos Ace headphones perform well across the board with strong noise canceling, excellent sound quality and good voice-calling performance. Well balanced, they're clean sounding with nice detail and sparkle in the treble along with punchy, powerful bass that doesn't get boomy. Vocals sounded natural and the headphones have a relatively wide soundstage. It's also good to see that the headphones have USB-C audio support (wired listening with a USB-C cable) and spatial audio with head-tracking.Reasons to buyThe Sonos Ace are one of the top noise-canceling headphones on the market, rivaling flagship models from Sony, Apple and Bose. Now that they've been out for more than a year, we're seeing some good discounts on them, which makes them a better value and a potential alternative to Sony's new WH-1000XM6 headphones. While you don't have to be an owner of Sonos speakers to buy them, Sonos soundbar owners can leverage the TV Audio Swap feature for private late-night movie watching or video game playing (there's no audio latency). The feature was glitchy at launch, but now works well and a lot of Sonos fans think it's one of the key selling points of the headphone over competing premium models.Reasons to skip/keep lookingYou can make the argument that Sony's new WH-1000XM6 are slightly better overall for around the same price (I'm talking list price -- and yes, they're too pricey for some folks). But with the Ace selling for as low as $330, they're an easier sell.  ... Show more

Sony's previous generation flagship ANC headphones
Sony WH-1000XM5
9.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Refined sound profile with more balanced, accurate sound
Enhanced noise canceling does a better job muffling a wider range of frequencies
Light (250 grams) and comfortable to wear for long periods with breathable, synthetic-leather ear pads
Excellent voice-calling performance with impressive noise reduction
Robust feature set
Cons
Higher price tag than the previous model
Somewhat bulky carrying case (single-hinge design means headphones fold flat but not up)
Some XM4 users may prefer the more energized bass performance of that model
The WH-1000XM6 offers noticeably design and perfomance improvements
Why I like themSony has released its new-for-2025 WH-1000XM6 headphones, but its former flagship model, the XM5 is still an excellent headphone that's often on sale for closer to $300. Their noise-canceling, voice-calling and sound isn't quite as good as what the XM6 offers (the XM6 sounds a little more detailed with improved bass performance) and the XM6 has a dual-hinge design that allows them to fold up, not just fold flat. As a result, the XM6's case is a little smaller. Additionally, the XM6 is powered by a new QN3 chip that Sony says delivers 7 times the performance of the QN1 chip found in the XM5s. All that said, while the jump in performance from the XM5 to the XM6 is certainly noticeable, it isn't huge; the XM5 still offers good sound, noise-canceling and voice-calling performance that should satisfy most people. Read my Sony WH-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyThe biggest reason to buy the XM5 is if you can't afford the XM6 and find the XM5 substantially discounted. It's still quite competitive with the Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, the Sonos Ace and Apple's AirPods Max.
Reasons to skip/keep lookingIt's always a little hard to buy a previous-generation headphone that was released three years ago (2022) when you know a newer, better model (the XM6) exists and will eventually go on sale.

Best Apple noise-canceling wireless earbuds
Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C)
9.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Very good sound with slightly upgraded acoustic architecture
Apple's H2 chip brings features like Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness
Charging case has U1 chip, built-in speaker for Find My, wireless charging
Top-notch voice-calling performance and top-tier noise cancellation with natural-sounding transparency mode
User-friendly playback controls on stems
Cons
Supports high-resolution audio (20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio) with Apple Vision Pro headset but not other Apple devices
Still no XL ear tips
Battery life is shorter than competitors
Limited feature set for Android users
Why I like themI still find AirPods Pro 2 hard to beat, especially for Apple users, who get seamless audio switching with all their Apple devices that are on their iCloud account. They're lightweight and comfortable to wear, have strong performance across the board, including good sound and top-tier noise-canceling along with top-notch voice-calling performance and spatial audio with head tracking. Powered by Apple's H2 chip, they also have a robust feature set (Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Hearing Aid features) and are powered by Apple's H2 chip. The charging case, equipped with Apple's U1 chip and a built-in speaker, has the most advanced version of Apple's FindMy feature with precision finding. In 2023, Apple made some updates to the the AirPods Pro 2, shifting from Lightning to USB-C charging and offering some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the company's pricey Vision Pro headset. But the buds are otherwise identical to their Lightning predecessor.Reasons to buyThe AirPods Pro 2's are compact, well-designed earbuds that are comfortable to wear, fit a wide range of ears
and offer strong performance across the board, plus a robust feature set that now includes Apple's Hearing Aid feature. They remain a safe bet for Apple users.Reasons you should skip/keep lookingIf you use an Android phone, you should probably look elsewhere because you don't get access to the full suite of features that make these earbuds special. As for Apple users, unless you need new buds right now, rumor has it that the AirPods Pro 3 are expected to be released later this year -- likely alongside the iPhone 17 this fall. So you may want to wait to see what they offer.

Pros
Sturdy, eye-catching design with translucent elements
Clean, clear sound with well-defined bass that's enjoyable to listen to
Strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance
Excellent controls that are intuitive to use

Nice carrying case (although some find the zipper problematic)
Cons

They fold flat but don't fold up
Sound quality is good but not a wow
The ear pads are not easily removable and it's unclear whether they're replaceable
The Nothing Headphone (1) ended up being more impressive than I thought it would be. Nothing has always been a good marketing company that usually does a bang-up job hyping its products. Its first earbuds were a little more style over substance (the performance has improved with more recent models), but this headphone's sturdy, eye-catching design is backed by strong performance. While I have some quibbles with the headphone being a little heavy, and I slightly prefer the sound quality of some competing models, this is one of the best new headphones of 2025. It will be interesting to see if its price can come down a bit to make it an even more compelling premium noise-canceling headphone option. Read Nothing Headphone (1) review.Reasons to buyIf you can't afford the AirPods Max or Sony WH-1000XM6 and want a pair of unique-looking, sturdy headphones that also offer strong performance, the Nothing Headphone (1) is an intriguing alternative.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe design isn't for everyone and they fall a little short compared with top premium models like the Sony WH-1000XM6.  ...

Cons
Premium price tag
No Find My feature integrated into app
Included ear tips might not work for all ear shapes
Some features limited to Android users
Why I like themWhen Sony set out to design its WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds, it was looking to address some gripes folks had with their predecessor, the WF-1000XM4 earbuds that came out in 2021. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling performance. Overall they're impressive -- easily among the top earbuds on the market. Equipped with 8.2mm speaker driver units and two new proprietary Sony chipsets (V2 Integrated and QN2e Noise-Canceling processors), the earbuds deliver rich sound with nice detail, clear mids and punchy, well-defined bass. Read my full WF-1000XM5 review.Reasons to buyI try a lot of new earbuds but I keep coming back the the WF-1000XM5s because they're just all-around very good earbuds, with strong overall performance and a solid feature set, including LDAC audio codec support for Android users and Sony's Speak-to-Chat feature that automatically lowers the volume of your music and puts the earbuds into ambient sound mode so you can easily have a conversation without removing your buds. Also, now that the buds have been out for around two years, they're often on sale and you can also find well-priced refurbished units. Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile these earbuds are more compact and should be a good fit for more people's ears, they still might not fit some ears. Not everybody will get a tight seal from the included foam ear tips, even though they're available in four size options. Also, note that next-gen Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds should be coming in 2026.

SCORE
Pros
Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit
Best-in-class noise canceling and natural-sounding transparency mode
Dynamic sound with swell-defined bass
Immersive Audio with "still" and "motion" spatial audio modes widens soundstage
Slightly improved voice-calling
Cons
Buds are a bit bulky
No wireless charging or multipoint Bluetooth
Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life (6 hours to 4 hours)
Why I like themWhile Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are a little bigger than many true-wireless earbuds, they've always fit my ears comfortably and securely thanks to their "interlocking fit" system with Fit Kit eartips and stabilizers (the Ultras feature a new notch to keep the stabilizers in place). Not only do the Ultras have great sound, but they deliver exceptional noise canceling -- possibly the best available -- and a natural-sounding transparency mode. I also liked Bose's new Immersive Audio spatial audio technology with head-tracking, which helps open up the soundstage and improves the sound a bit (it does use extra battery life). These buds also have good voice-calling performance, though it's not quite as good as what you get with the AirPods Pro 2. Multipoint Bluetooth pairing was added in July 2024. Read my QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.Reasons to buyIf you're looking for earbuds with best-in-class noise canceling and very good sound quality, the QC Ultra Earbuds fit the bill. They should also fit most ears well, and Bose tends to have good customer support should you have any issues. Just look for them at a discount because they've been on the market since September 2023.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThese buds are pricey, and there are premium buds to consider in this price range (or cost less if you're on a tighter budget). Also the the QC Ultra earbuds are bulkier than options like AirPods Pro 2, which may be an issue for those who prefer a more compact earbuds design.  ... Show more

Excellent voice-calling performance with new microphones and voice accelerometers to help pinpoint your voice
Built-in heart-rate sensors

A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2 (no Precision Finding, Conversation Awareness or Adaptive Audio)
Some Apple-exclusive features unavailable to Android users
Built-in heart-rate monitor may not seem like a needed feature to some people
Why I like themThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they have a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the five different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.These new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.Reasons to buyFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).  ...

Top-sounding earbuds from Panasonic
Technics EAH-AZ100
Pros
Top-notch sound quality sound with upgraded Magnetic Fluid drivers
More compact design should offer more secure, comfortable fit for more ears
Slightly improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance
Triple multipoint Bluetooth pairing
Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking
Five ear tip sizes with new medium-large option
Cons
Premium price point
Battery life drops significantly (by 30%) when using the LDAC audio codec, spatial audio and noise cancellation features
Buds still stick out of your ears a little more than some buds
Voice-calling performance could be slightly better
Why I like themPanasonic's new flagship earbuds, the Technics EAH-AZ100, have a more compact design than its earlier EAH-AZ80 buds (the AZ100s are 10% smaller and 16% lighter) along with improved sound quality, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. One of the key upgrades here is Panasonic's newly developed proprietary Magnetic Fluid Driver that Panasonic says creates "clean, high-resolution, low-vibration and low-distortion sounds for the most authentic, balanced audio that's true to the original source." This type of driver is found in Technics high-end EAH-TZ700 wired in-ear monitors ($1,200), and it's been miniaturized for use in the AZ100s.I thought the AZ80s sounded good, and these new AZ100s sound even better, with clean, accurate sound that brings out details in your music you don't hear with lesser earbuds (Android users get support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). As for extra features, there's Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head tracking, plus you can pair with up to three devices simultaneously (most multipoint Bluetooth-enabled earbuds allow you to pair to two devices). Reasons to buyThe Technics EAH-AZ100 are among the best-sounding earbuds, so if sound quality is a priority, they should be on your short list. Also, the fact that their noise-canceling and voice-calling performance has improved is icing on the cake,Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 don't sound as good as these earbuds, they do offer superior noise canceling and voice-calling performance for less money along with an even more robust feature set, particularly for iPhone users.  ...

SCORE
Pros
Significantly improved sound quality with better clarity, definition and tighter bass
Durable, seamless faux-leather earpads for excellent comfort and acoustic seal
Improved noise canceling and more natural sounding transparency mode
Very good voice-calling performance
Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users
USB-C audio for lossless wired listening
Cons
Uses custom Beats chip rather than Apple's H2 chip (limits future feature upgrades)
No ear-detection sensors to automatically pause/resume audio
USB-C listening mode disables noise cancellation and transparency features
Why I like themLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as a wired headphone back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read my full review to find out what makes this a good headphone with some small caveats.Reason to buyWhile the Studio Pros are overpriced at their list price of $350, they frequently go on sale, sometimes for less than $200. They're a solid value at that price point, offering dynamic sound along with strong noise-canceling and voice-calling performance. While they're missing Apple's H2 chip and some of the extra features found in the latest AirPods models, they do have spatial audio with head-tracking and hands-free Siri for Apple users. And the Beats app for Android users allows for decent compatibility, though you don't get all the features that Apple users get.Reason to skip/keep lookingThe one big miss here is the lack of ear-detection sensors -- most $350 over-ear headphones have this feature, meaning your music doesn't automatically pause when you take the headphones off. I also think it was a mistake for Beats not to power these with Apple's H2 chip, as you won't get feature upgrades designed for that chip. And Android users don't get spatial audio with head tracking or hands-free Siri.   ... Show more

Why I like themWhen they're in your ears, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 look a lot like the original Pixel Buds Pro and retain the stabilizer fins that help lock the buds in your ears. But they're smaller than their predecessor and Google equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and boosts their performance across the board. How you ultimately feel about them will largely depend on how well they fit your ears. That's the case for most noise-canceling earbuds, but with the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you don't get a tight seal from the included ear tips, there's a massive dip in both sound quality and noise-canceling performance. If you do get a tight seal, these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users. Read my Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 review.Reasons to buyFor Pixel device owners, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have some extra appeal because they're designed to work more seamlessly with your Pixel devices (there's automatic switching between Pixel smartphones, tablets and watches) and also feature "Clear Calling" for Pixel smartphones, which improves voice calling performance a bit. That said, Android owners can take advantage of most of the Pixel Buds Pro 2's features, including hands-free Google Assistant and "Conversation Detect" feature that pauses what you're listening to and puts the buds in transparency mode when you start talking to someone.Reasons to skip/keep lookingI'll start by pointing out that while buds work just fine with iPhones, iPhone users miss out on several features, so Apple users should probably look elsewhere. From an ergonomic standpoint, the buds' smaller design should provide a better fit for a wider range of ears, but some people may find that the original Pixel Buds Pro fit their ears better. Also, some Android owners may be disappointed that the buds support neither Qualcomm's aptX or Sony's LDAC audio codecs (AAC and SBC are supported). Lastly, it's a little annoying that the white case can pick up stains from objects in pockets, though the case is easy enough to clean off with an alcohol wipe.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and comfortable to wear
High-quality ambient sound mode that sounds natural
Impressive feature set, including Voice Detect and built-on voice controls (no wake word required)
Dual driver design (10mm dynamic driver plus Planar tweeter) for excellent sound quality with superior treble clarity and bass definition
Top-notch voice-calling performance with very good noise reduction
Lights in buds are kind of cool
Cons
A little pricey
Some people may not be get a tight seal from the included ear tips, which have proprietary design
Design looks a tad generic and touch controls are a bit finicky
Noise canceling could be slightly better
Why I like themThe Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro stand out with their excellent fit, impressive sound quality and top-notch voice-calling performance. Though Samsung has added stems (it calls them "blades" and they have integrated LEDs) to these flagship earbuds, this new design works better for more people -- I found the buds lightweight and comfortable to wear. The sound quality is noticeably improved from the previous Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, with superior treble clarity and bass definition, producing a cleaner, more accurate sound. The ambient mode, which lets external sound into the buds, works well, sounding natural with no audible hiss. And I liked that the buds have their own built-in voice commands (they do not require a wake word like Google Assistant or Siri), an underrated feature. Read my Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review. Reasons to buySamsung had some kinks to work out with these buds at launch (they paused shipping them for a time), but they're excellent earbuds, with improved performance across the board. The stem design is a little controversial for fans of previous Galaxy buds, but I like their design and they're essentially Samsung's version of the AirPods Pro 2 but geared towards Android users and Galaxy device owners in particular who can take advantage of a few Samsung-only features like support for its "high-resolution" Samsung Seamless Codec (there's a Galaxy Wear app for Android users).Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile I've used them with my iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone users should probably look elsewhere, as there's no iOS app, meaning all updates and settings are only available via the Galaxy Wear app for Android. Those seeking the absolute best noise cancellation available might be disappointed, as the ANC, while good, is slightly behind what's offered by competitors. Finally, people with larger ear canals may not be able to get a tight seal with the included ear tips (only three sizes are provided). Since the ear tips are custom-designed for these buds, finding compatible third-party options can be challenging.  ... Show more

Why I like themSony's improved entry-level noise-canceling headphones, the CH-720Ns, have a bit of a plasticky budget vibe, but they're lightweight (only 192 grams) and comfortable. Part of me was expecting them to sound mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised, as these headphones offer good overall tonal balance with punchy bass, decent clarity and a wide soundstage (the headphones are suitable for a variety of music genres. They also offer decent noise canceling and good voice-calling performance.No, they don't sound as good or perform as well as Sony's WH-1000XM5 or new WH-1000XM6 headphones. But they sound more premium than they look -- and feel -- and their overall performance is a step up from their predecessor, the CH-710Ns. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that, like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these are frequently discounted to closer to $100, which makes them a good value.Reasons to buyBudget-conscious buyers seeking Sony quality at an accessible price will find that these offer a significant step up from truly entry-level headphone options.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe main reason not to get these is that you simply want a more premium noise-canceling headphone that not only offers better build quality but better overall performance along with more advanced features like ear-detection sensors, LDAC audio codec support and Sony's Quick Attention and Speak-to-Chat features. Sony also leaves out any sort of carrying case or pouch with these headphones, which is slightly disappointing.  ... Show more

Best Sennheiser noise-canceling headphones
Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent sound with punchy bass, wide soundstage and clear treble with equipped 42mm drivers
Improved noise canceling and voice-calling performance with two beam-forming microphones on each ear cup
Good sound personalization features in user-friendly companion app
Comfortable design with plush memory foam earbads that fold flat for better portability
Cons
Ho-hum design that only folds flat, not up
Noise cancellation may not quite match Sony and Bose competitors
Heavier (293 grams) than competitors despite less premium feel
Early connectivity issues with some iPhone models
Why I like themSennheiser's previous-generation Momentum Wireless headphones have always had a distinct look that was part retro, part modern and stood out for the exposed metal on their headband. For better or worse, that's all gone now, and the new Momentum 4 Wireless, Sennheiser's flagship noise-canceling headphones, look a bit more subdued and also a bit more like some of the company's competitors.The Momentum 4 Wireless offers superior performance over the Momentum 3 Wireless in every regard, although the biggest gains are with noise canceling and voice-calling performance as well as battery life, which is outstanding -- up to 60 hours at moderate volume levels. There's also a transparency mode that allows ambient sound in, and they have the ability to create a custom sound profile in the Smart Control app for iOS and Android using the built-in EQ, sound modes and a new Sound Personalization feature that "assesses the user's listening preferences and adjusts the listening experience according to their taste." Equipped with 42mm drivers, Sennheiser says the Momentum 4 Wireless offers "best-in-class" sound, which is debatable. I'd say the Momentum 4's sound quality is right there with other models in this price range -- they sound excellent, with the requisite well-defined, punchy bass, relatively wide soundstage (they sound pretty open) and smooth treble that brings out some of the finer details in well-recorded tracks. They're a pleasure to listen to.Reasons to buyThe Momentum 4 Wireless costs less than flagship models from Sony, Bose and Apple and offer excellent sound and good build quality. Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile I'm fan of the Momentum 4 Wireless and like their sound a lot, they're noise canceling and comfort level isn't as good as what you get from the Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5 or WH-1000XM6.

Bose QuietComfort Headphones
8.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Exceptionally comfortable design that maintains the classic QuietComfort fit
Very good sound and noise canceling with new Wind Block feature to reduce wind noise during outdoor use
Good voice-calling performance with integrated cable microphone and six on-ear mics for clear transmission
USB-C audio for lossless wired listening that now features integrated microphone for wired calls
Cons
Higher price than previous QC45 model, despite minimal changes
Lacks Immersive Audio feature and premium materials found in the Quiet Comfort Ultra model
Value proposition is questionable with fewer advanced features compared to similarly-priced competitors
Why I like themWhen Bose released its new flagship QuietComfort Ultra Headphones in late 2023, it also replaced the QuietComfort 45s with a slightly updated model simply called the QuietComfort Headphones. Like the QC 45s, this model carries on the comfortable tried-and-true legacy QuietComfort design that's been around for a few generations that a lot of people continue to love. The QC Ultra Headphones add Bose's new Immersive Audio feature and have a more refined design with some metal parts (they also have Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1). But the QuietComfort Headphones still have good sound (the Ultras offer a small step up in sound quality), excellent noise canceling and strong voice-calling performance.As for differences between these and the QC45s, Bose says it adjusted some of the electronics to improve battery life (now 24 hours vs. 22 hours) and adjusted the logos to make the products "visually distinguishable and more in line with its latest design language." It also added an inline microphone to the auxiliary cable to "help with some users who may prefer a plug-and-play solution rather than Bluetooth pairing." There's also a Wind Block feature and some additional small performance improvements due to software upgrades. Finally, the headphones come in several new colors, including pink. Some colors may only be available at bose.com.Reasons to buyIf you're a fan of Bose's earlier "iconic" headphones design that began with the QC35 (or maybe even the QC25), this is the Bose headphone for you. Cheaper than the QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, they also regularly go on sale for $250 or less, marking them a more attractive value.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are better headphones overall, with improved all-around performance and a more premium design.  ...

Support for high-quality LDAC audio codec with compatible devices
Included hard carrying case and cable for wired listening
Cons
Bit generic looking
ANC disabled when in wired mode
They're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models
Why I like themEarfun has made some very solid budget earbuds, and now it's entered the full-size ANC headphone space with a few different over-ear models, including the Wave Pro (add the code EWPROCNET at checkout on Amazon to receive an additional 10% off). While they may not sound as good as premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose or Sony, they're comfortable to wear, feature decent sound with punchy bass (they're a bit lacking in clarity and bass definition compared to more expensive models), and they offer respectable noise canceling (you can toggle between two levels of ANC) and voice-calling performance. The headphones do come with a cable for wired listening -- you can plug into an inflight entertainment system -- but the noise canceling cuts off when you're in wired mode, which is unfortunate.Reasons to buyFor less than $60, you're getting decent sounding headphones with effective noise canceling that are comfortable to wear and have long battery lfie. They're also one of the few budget headphones that come with a carrying case.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones lack the treble clarity and bass definition found in higher-end models.  ...

Top budget headphones
QCY H3 Pro
Pros
Good sound quality for their relatively low price
Lightweight and comfortable with memory-foam ear pads
Decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance for a budget headphone
USB-C audio and wired mode with included cable for lossless listening
Support for LDAC audio codec and multipoint Bluetooth pairing
Companion app offers various customization options
Cons
Noise canceling cuts off in wired mode
No carry case or pouch included
Some occasional distortion
Why I Like ThemQCY is another Chinese brand like Tribit, Earfun and plenty of others that make budget-priced headphones that sound better than you'd think they would for their relatively low price (the company says the Q stands for quality, C stands for creative and Y stands for youth). Its new-for-2024 H3 Pro headphones are similar to models in this price range from 1More, Tribit and Edifier, but they arguably sound a touch better and I found them relatively comfortable to wear, as they feature a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads.The sound quality on these budget models tends to vary a bit from track to track. While I encountered some occasional distortion on badly recorded material and the treble just can't produce the clarity and detail that you get with more premium headphones, all in all, the sound quality was quite respectable. The noise canceling also is fairly decent -- there are a few different modes to choose from in QCY's companion app for iOS and Android, which has a low-frills-looking interface but is robust enough under the hood -- and callers said the voice-calling performance was also good, especially given the price of these headphones.You do get multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to connect two devices simultaneously (you have to activate it in the app), but features like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off are missing. Also, you can set the headphones to automatically turn off after not being in use for a certain amount of time (I set it for 15 minutes), but the headphones turned off in the middle of a long call I was making, not seeming to realize that I was using the headphones. The H3 Pro headphones are decent value for the cost, particularly when their price dips closer to $50.Reasons to buyLike the handful of other budget headphones I recommend, the QCY H3 Pro are better than you'd think they'd be for their modest price in terms of both design and performance.Reasons to skip/ keep lookingIf you're a critical listener, these probably aren't for you as these headphones occasionally distort audio and lack the treble clarity found in higher-end models. Also, it's too bad they don't come with any sort of carrying pouch and noise cancelling isn't available when using the cable for wired listening (you'd kind of want noise canceling if you're watching a movie on a plane plugged into your seat's inflight entertainment system).  ...

Top midrange headphones
Sennheiser Accentum Plus
Pros
Very good sound quality with good clarity and well-defined bass
Good noise canceling with adaptive technology and voice-calling performance
Multiple connectivity options including USB-C audio for lossless wired listening
Hard carrying case included for added protection
Impressive features like touch controls, adaptive noise canceling and AptX Adaptive Audio codec support
Cons
Initial tight clamping force that requires a break-in period
Uninspired design that lacks distinction
Sound quality doesn't match the flagship Momentum 4's with larger 42mm (compared to Accentum Plus' 37mm)
Why I Like ThemIf you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum 4 Wireless and other premium models from Bose, Sony and Apple, the Sennheiser Accentum Plus is a good midrange alternative that doesn't quite offer the same performance as those higher-end models but offers better build quality and sound than most budget noise canceling headphones. In essence, these are a slightly stripped down version of the Momentum 4 Wireless and share a similar aesthetic and the same touch controls but feature different drivers (the Momentum Wireless 4 have larger 42mm drivers and offer richer, more detailed sound with slightly better bass performance). Still, these sound good for the money, offer respectable noise canceling and support USB-C audio wired listening and the aptX Adaptive audio codec that's compatible with some Android devices. Reasons to buyIt costs about half the price of premium models in the $350 to $400 range and delivers 75 to 80% of their performance. Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Accentum Plus has a little more clamping force than some headphones so not everybody finds it incredibly comfortable (it helps to stretch the headband and break it in a bit so to speak). While it sounds quite good for the money, its noise canceling performance isn't as good as what you get from premium models from Bose and Sony.

Best-sounding wireless noise-canceling headphones
Focal Bathys
Pros
Audiophile sound quality with excellent clarity, detail, accuracy and powerful, well-defined bass
Distinct design with premium build quality and LED lighting element in ear cups
USB-C wired listening option with high-quality DAC (digital-to-analog converter)
Solid voice-calling performance with good noise-reduction
Cons
Quite expensive
Noise canceling is comparatively light and behind that of Sony, Bose andApple
Included cables don't match the premium build of the headphones themselves
Can't be used in passive mode when battery is depleted
Why I Like ThemFrench audio company Focal is known for its high-end speakers and headphones. You might call it the Bowers & Wilkins of France. And now it's finally done what a lot of high-end audio companies have had to do in this age of on-the-go wireless music listening: make active noise-canceling Bluetooth headphones. Easily one of the best-sounding wireless headphones, the pricey Bathys don't only have wireless connectivity but also a built-in digital-to-analog converter for USB wired listening with any computer, smartphone or tablet with USB-C.Going wired gives you a slight bump up in sound quality (it does help to stream high-resolution audio files for optimal sound). In wired mode, the headphones deliver up to 24-bit/192kHz resolution. But the headphones also sound quite impressive in wireless mode with excellent clarity, detail, accuracy and powerful, well-defined bass. They have a spacious soundstage (for a closed-back headphone) and allow you to hear each instrument distinctly in complicated tracks where several instruments are playing at the same time. They're what I call "revealing" headphones that will make bad recordings sound worse and good recordings sound even better.Reasons to buyWireless headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM6 sound excellent. But if you're looking for wireless headphones that take it to the next level -- we're talking best of the best for sound quality from a wireless headphone -- the Bathys should be on your shortlist.Reasons to skip/keep lookingAside from the fact that they're quite pricey, these may be a little too much headphone for some people in more ways than one. While they're more compact than Focal's wired headphones, the Bathys are still large headphones (they weigh 350 grams) and will look that way on your head. Also, while their noise-canceling is decent enough, with a low and high mode ("silent" and "soft") as well a transparency mode, it's not nearly as good as what you get with Sony and Bose flagship ANC models. (ANC has a tendency to degrade the sound, so there's always a delicate balance adding ANC when sound quality is the priority.)  ... Show more

Top wired over-ear headphones for the money
Sony MDR-M1
Pros
Exceptional sound quality with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass
Distortion-free performance even at higher volume levels
Easy to drive at 50 ohms without requiring dedicated amplification
Lightweight and comfortable with cushy ear pads that provide good passive noise isolation
One short (1.2 meter) and one longer (2.5 meter) cable included, as well as a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter for professional audio equipment
Cons
Not a foldable model, so no carrying case or pouch included
Ear pad depth may be too shallow for all ear sizes
No active noise cancellation, inline controls or microphone on included cables
Purely wired design with no wireless connectivity options (requires adapter for use with newer smartphones lacking headphone jacks)
Why I Like ThemWe've always been fans of Sony's MDR-7506 wired studio monitor headphones, which have long been favorite headphones of recording engineers and other sound professionals. The 2024 MDR-M1 are essentially a premium version of the 7506, delivering sound that's hard to match for the price. These are the wired headphones that will make you realize what you're missing after listening to wireless headphones for so long. They have big, open sound with excellent clarity, accuracy and tight bass. Not only is their sound a noticeable step up from the 7506s, but these get high marks for their comfort level (they weigh a svelte 216 grams). No, there isn't any noise canceling, but the soft, cushy ear pads offer good passive noise isolation.Though they play louder with a headphone amp, they're easy to drive (50 ohms), so you can plug them directly into a computer's headphone port or a smartphone (likely with a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter). They come with 1.2m and 2.5m straight detachable cables and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm screw-in plug adapter, but no carrying pouch or case is included. The only downside I see is that the ear pads aren't all that deep, so it's possible those with large ears that stick out a bit might have some issue with the M1's fit -- your ears might press up against the drivers, which are notable for serving up distortion-free audio, even at higher volume levels. That said, they look and feel like an upgraded version of the 7506, so if those worked for you, these should too.Reasons to buyYou can get more expensive audiophile wired headphones, but the MDR-M1 deliver very good bang for your buck thanks to their relatively affordable price point. They both sound great are a comfortable to wear.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThose seeking the convenience of wireless connectivity should obviously look elsewhere, as these are purely wired headphones. Also, while these are clearly an upgrade over the MDR-7506, some people may find that the price bump from that model doesn't quite meet the bump in performance the MDR-M1 offers. In other words, you may be just fine with the MDR-7506, which costs less than half the price.

Pros
Good sound quality with decent clarity, well-defined bass and fairly wide soundstage
Affordable (less than $80)
Lightweight (265 grams) with comfortable memory foam ear pads
USB-C audio capability for lossless wired listening
Bluetooth 5.4 and support for LDAC, SBC and AAC audio codecs
Customizable sound profiles through companion app
Improved noise cancellation compared to previous model
Cons
No carrying case
No 3.5mm jack for wired listening
Sound quality lacks the the refinement and depth of higher-end models
Why I Like ThemThe Edifier W830NB looks slightly more premium than its predecessor, W820NB Plus, and like that earlier popular budget model, is fairly lightweight (265 grams) and comfortable, with cushy memory foam ear pads. They also sound very good for their price, offering decent clarity and fairly well-defined bass with an amply wide sound stage (they lack the refinement and depth of higher-end headphones, but you can't expect the world from sub-$80 headphones). You can tweak the sound profile in Edifier's companion app for iOS and Android.The W830NBs do have a few additional improvements over the W820NB Plus. First, you get Bluetooth 5.4 (instead of 5.2). Also, along with the LDAC and SBC audio codecs, the W830NB supports the AAC audio codec. The noise canceling is a tad better (it's decent but not up to the level of what you get with Bose and Sony headphones) and battery life is rated for up to an impressive 54 hours with noise canceling on, up from 49 hours. A couple of things are still missing. There's no official carrying case or headphone jack, although you can connect them to your computer with a USB-C cable for a wired connection.Reasons to buyThe Edifier W830NB headphones are one of the few budget noise-canceling headphones I recommend to folks who don't want to spend too much on a headphone but want something decent that doesn't look and feel too cheap, is comfortable to wear and delivers respectable sound and noise-canceling.Reasons to skip/keep lookingYou can only expect so much from these headphones. They're better than you'd expect given their price, but more premium models that cost significantly more do offer better performance and built quality. Also, although these have USB-C audio, they're missing a 3.5mm headphone cable to plug into the headphone jack of an inflight entertainment systems. And no carrying case is included.  ... Show more

Superior sounding over-ear wireless headphones
Noble Fokus Apollo
Pros
Superb sound quality from unique dual-driver design (40mm dynamic plus 14.5mm planar-magnetic)
Rich, open sound (for closed back headphones) with tight bass and excellent treble detail
Comfortable fit with premium Alcantara material on the headband and replaceable protein leather ear pads
Detachable boom microphone included for voice-calling and gaming
USB-C audio for lossless wired listening
Cons
Quite pricey
Noise-canceling isn't top-notch and falls short of leading brands
Missing some extra bells and whistles like wear sensors for auto-pause functionality
Uses Qualcomm's mid-tier QC3084 chip rather than flagship 5-series processor
Why I Like ThemNoble is an audiophile brand known more for its in-ear monitor headphones, but it's released a wireless noise-canceling headphone called the Fokus Apollo that sounds terrific and features a special dual-driver design that combines a 40mm dynamic driver with a 14.5mm planar-magnetic driver. The result is rich, open sound, with tight bass and excellent treble detail and clarity, especially for a wireless headphone (it sounds a tad better in wired mode but it's not a huge difference). It's more dynamic than many monitor headphones that have a flatter, more neutral sound profile, but it still leans toward being an accurate, well-balanced headphone.The design of the headphones is slightly generic looking, but they have some premium accents (Alcantara material on the headband and protein leather ear pads that are replaceable), and they fit my head comfortably. A decent, albeit somewhat large carrying case is included along with a cable for wired listening (USB-C audio is supported). And in case you want to use the headphones for videoconference calls at home or do a little multiplayer gaming, a detachable boom microphone ships with the headphones.Equipped with a Qualcomm QC3084 chip (Bluetooth 5.3) and an ADI chip, the Fokus Apollo 'phones support a wide variety of audio codecs, including LDAC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and SBC. Interestingly, that's not Qualcomm's higher-end 5-series chip, but I had no issues with wireless performance, and voice-calling performance was good with decent noise reduction. Battery life is another plus. It's rated for up 60 hours with ANC on at moderate volume levels.Reasons to buyA lot of people ask me what the best-sounding wireless noise-canceling headphones are for audiophiles, and I put the Fokus Apollo and Focal Bathys at the top of my list.Reasons to skip/keep lookingAs with a lot of audiophile active noise-canceling headphones, the noise canceling is decent but not up to the level of what Bose, Sony and Apple ANC headphones offer. ANC impacts sound quality, so it's not surprising it's a little lighter with this headphone (there's also a transparency mode and a companion app for iOS and Android that allows you to tweak settings). It's also worth noting that you don't get extra bells and whistles like wear sensors that pause your music when you take the headphones off -- you're really buying this headphone for its sound quality and those dual drivers.  ...

Factors to consider when choosing headphones
Budget and performanceBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new headphones. A quick tip -- consider the price-to-performance ratio rather than just the lowest price. Entry level models ($30-$80) typically offer decent sound but fewer premium features. Mid-range options ($80-$150) balance sound quality with features like basic ANC, a better build and water- and dust- resistance (IP ratings) for portable models. Premium headphones ($150-$300+) deliver superior sound engineering, advanced noise cancellation, extended battery life for wireless models and other specialized features like planar magnetic drivers or high-resolution audio support. Determine which features matter most for your specific use cases -- commuting, exercise, professional calls, audiophile listening or gaming -- and invest accordingly rather than paying for features you may not use.Noise cancellationActive noise cancellation technology uses microphones and special processors to generate anti-noise that neutralizes any ambient sound. Adaptive ANC automatically adjusts to your environment, while adjustable systems let you control noise cancellation levels manually. Some premium models offer specialized noise cancellation for different environments (airplanes, traffic noise, ambient chatter). Over-ear headphones typically provide the best ANC performance due to larger drivers and sealed ear cups, while on-ear models offer less isolation than their on- and in-ear counterparts. If you know you'll be listening in busier environments, look for headphones with ANC. Do keep in mind that active noise cancellation can limit both battery life and sound quality, so if you're hoping to salvage those, look for headphones that advertise a natural-sounding transparency mode that allows ambient sound in without digital artifacts.Battery lifeIf you’re eyeing some wireless headphones and expect to be using them for long stretches of time, be sure to consider the battery life. True wireless earbuds typically offer 5-12 hours on a single change, while over-ear wireless headphones can provide 20-60+ hours. Both models’ battery life depends largely on feature usage, with ANC reducing battery life by about 20-30%. If you're crunched for time, look for fast-charging capabilities that offer at least 1 hour of playback from 5-10 minutes of charging. Also consider battery degradation -- like any battery-powered device, expect maximum battery capacity to drop up to 80% from its original specifications after several charge cycles. Make sure the typical length of your listening sessions is in line with the battery life of the model you choose. General featuresToday's headphones are often jam-packed with features that can make a huge difference in your listening habits. If you want the best sound possible, advanced codec support impacts audio quality substantially. Look for AAC compatibility for Apple devices, or aptX Adaptive or LDAC for Android. Many headphones offer on-model controls for those looking for easy ways to switch songs, adjust volume or answer calls. Control interfaces vary from touch-sensitive panels to physical buttons, rotary dials and voice commands. Microphone arrays with beamforming technology and AI noise suppression dramatically improve call quality, with over-ear models often featuring detachable boom mics for gaming. Companion apps offer customizable EQ settings, firmware updates and additional features like spatial audio or gaming modes to keep your headphones’ features in one spot. Consider how you plan to use your headphones and choose the features best suited to your needs.DurabilityYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that I note have sturdy build quality. Construction materials can impact longevity -- premium models use reinforced plastics, aluminum or even carbon fiber components to keep them safe from scratches and dents. For portable models, consider foldable designs with reinforced hinges and quality carrying cases. Water resistance is especially relevant for earbuds and sports-oriented headphones, with ratings from IPX4 (splash-resistant) to IP68 (fully dust- and waterproof). Over-ear headphones should have durable headband padding, sturdy adjustment mechanisms and hinges and replaceable ear pads for long-term comfort. If you’re looking for a pair with wired connectivity, be sure to look for detachable cables with reinforced connectors. Also consider your portability needs: frequent travel or long commutes calls for compact, folding designs, while larger, less portable models can work for home or otherwise stationary use.Form factor and designThe physical design of your headphones can have a major impact on your listening experience. Earbuds or in-ear models offer the best portability and are usually best for exercise and commuting and can provide excellent noise isolation when properly fitted. Still, their portability means they are most susceptible to loss and damage and the in-ear design may cause ear fatigue during long listening sessions. On-ear headphones sit on your ears and balance portability with sound quality – they’re more comfortable than earbuds for longer sessions while remaining relatively compact, though they may not seal as well and can create pressure points on your head and ears over time. Over-ear headphones surround your ears completely, typically delivering the best sound quality and comfort. They excel at noise cancellation and often house larger drivers for superior bass response and a larger sound stage, but they’re bulkier and less portable. Connection type can make a big difference, too. Wired headphones offer consistent, superior audio quality without battery concerns, lower latency for gaming and often better value at each price point, though they limit mobility and cables can wear over time. Wireless models provide freedom of movement and convenience, with many offering both connection options for flexibility. True wireless earbuds eliminate cables entirely, however have the shortest battery life and are easiest to misplace without a cable or headband connecting the buds together. Consider your primary use cases – portable convenience, home listening or professional use – to determine the best form factor and connectivity for your needs. Fit and comfortProper fit is critical for sound quality and long-term comfort. For earbuds, look for models with different ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) in different materials (silicone for durability, memory foam for comfort and isolation) to help achieve the proper fit. If you plan on running or otherwise heavy movement in your earbuds, look for wingtips -- sometimes called sport fins -- that lock the buds in your ears. Over-ear and on-ear headphones require different considerations: adjustable headbands, adequate padding, appropriate clamping force and ear cups that accommodate different head sizes and ear shapes. Test for comfort during extended sessions – over-ear models should distribute weight evenly without creating pressure points, while on-ear designs should balance secure fit with minimal pressure. Consider heat buildup for closed-back designs and whether you prefer velour or leather ear pad materials. Return policyIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case they break or aren't a good match for you and your listening needs. Manufacturer warranties typically range from 1-2 years, with premium brands often offering better customer service and replacement options. Research how companies handle common issues like driver failure, cable problems or charging defects for wireless models. Retailer return policies supplement manufacturer warranties -- major electronics retailers typically allow 14-30 day returns, while specialized audio retailers sometimes offer more extended evaluation periods. If you're on the quest for the perfect headphones, be sure to get a longer trial period to assess their performance. How we test headphones
I follow CNET's unbiased evaluation process for all of my headphones testing. In the CNET sound lab, I compare similarly styled and priced models side-by-side based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, extra features, voice-calling and value.
Testing Sony WH-1000XM6's noise canceling on the subway. David Carnoy/CNETDesignI first assess how comfortable the headphones fit (their ergonomics), typically testing each model for several hours across multiple days. For wireless earbuds, I test all included ear tip sizes (typically S/M/L) and evaluate their stability during movement or other physical activity. For over-ear and on-ear headphones, I examine headband padding, ear cup comfort, clamping force, heat buildup and how well they accommodate different head sizes and shapes during extended listening sessions. Build quality assessments include stress testing case hinges and folding mechanisms, examining material durability and verifying IPX ratings, or dust- and water-resistance through exposure to appropriate environmental conditions, though this primarily applies to earbuds and select sports-oriented over-ear models. For over-ear headphones, I also assess cable quality and detachability, headband adjustment range and retention and the durability of any active components like buttons, noise cancellation controls or touch interfaces.Sound quality I evaluate sound quality and music experience by listening to a set playlist of music tracks specifically selected to evaluate different frequency ranges and acoustic characteristics: Frequency RangeTest TrackAcoustic Characteristics Sub-bass extension (20-60Hz) Spoon's "Knock Knock Knock"Features sustained low-frequency content that tests earbuds' ability to reproduce the deepest bass frequencies without distortion. The opening drum pattern and bass line provide excellent evaluation of sub-bass presence.Mid-bass articulation (60-200Hz) Drake's "Passionfruit"The prominent bass line throughout this track offers a perfect test for punch, attack, and control in the mid-bass region. The rhythmic foundation reveals how well earbuds handle bass definition and separation.Lower-midrange clarity (200-500Hz) The Doors' "Touch Me - Take 3"The foundational instruments in this track occupy the crucial lower-midrange, testing how earbuds handle the warmth and body of instruments without muddiness. Ray Manzarek's keyboard parts are especially revealing.Upper-midrange presence (500Hz-2kHz) Taylor Swift's "Vigilante Shit"Vocals predominantly live in this frequency range, and Swift's intimate vocal delivery provides an excellent reference for midrange clarity, presence, and articulation. The track also tests earbuds' ability to maintain vocal intelligibility.Lower-treble detail (2-8kHz) Athletes of God's "Don't Wanna Be Normal"Contains complex instrumental textures with significant content in the lower treble region, revealing how earbuds handle detail retrieval and instrumental separation without sibilance or harshness.Upper-treble extension (8-20kHz) Jvke's "Golden Hour"The atmospheric production and layered high-frequency content test earbuds' ability to reproduce air, space, and the highest overtones. The track reveals limitations in high-frequency extension and resolution.Dynamic range and transient response Orbital's "Dirty Rat"The electronic production features sharp transients and significant dynamic contrasts, testing earbuds' ability to handle micro-dynamics and maintain clarity during complex passages with multiple simultaneous elements.
This includes testing how well earbuds seal in the ear canal versus how over-ear models create their acoustic environment, and assessing soundstage differences between open-back and closed-back designs where applicable. Noise-canceling performanceI evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they muffle lower frequencies (about 65dB of broadband noise). I then head out to the busy streets of New York City to use the headphones in a real-world environment, testing their performance in:Public transit environments, like buses, trains and subway platforms (85-90dB of variable noise)Busy street intersections for traffic and construction noise (45-70dB of line source noise)Areas with ambient chatter and voices (70-75dB of speech-dominated noise)Each environment is tested several times. For over-ear headphones, I also evaluate passive noise isolation provided by the ear cup seal, while for earbuds I assess how different ear tip sizes affect noise blocking performance. Extra featuresSome great-sounding headphones aren't loaded with features, but I do take into account what extra features are on board and test them accordingly. Modern features include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation). I test special sound modes like EQ customization, bass modes and spatial audio features, as well as the efficiency of ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off of your ears. For over-ear models, I also evaluate features like quick-charge capabilities, wired/wireless flexibility and comfort-focused elements like auto-pause when lifting an ear cup. Bluetooth connectivity is tested by subjecting the headphones to a wireless range test or repeated device-switching if Bluetooth multipoint is included. I also take a look at the companion app for the headphones (if there is one) and test its user-friendliness across both mobile and desktop platforms where available..Voice-calling performanceWhen I test voice-calling performance, I make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. I assess their reaction to traffic noise and windy conditions for microphone performance. I assess microphone performance in response to traffic noise and windy conditions, testing both built-in microphones on wireless models and detachable boom mics on gaming-focused headphones where applicable. We also move between quiet and noisy environments to test their response, then collect feedback from call recipients about voice clarity and background noise reduction.ValueFinally, I determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones against all these criteria and what they’re able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Great sounding, feature-packed headphones that offer a great bang for your buck earn top marks in this category. Other headphones we tested
Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds: Bose has released its improved QC Ultra Earbuds (2nd gen), which means you'll be able to find discounts on the original QC Ultra Earbuds. They feature excellent sound and previously best-in-class noise-canceling performance.Bowers & Wilkins PX8: The swanky Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones feature 40mm Carbon Cone drive units that are "inspired" by the Carbon Dome drive units used in the company's iconic 700 Series loudspeaker line. They look great and feature excellent sound. However, B&W has said to expect a next-gen "S2" version of the PX8 to arrive later this year that will likely offer significant improvements, particularly to noise-canceling and voice-calling performance give what we've seen the with the new-for-2025 PX7 S3. Apple AirPods 4 with ANC: The AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply special, but I still preferred the AirPods Pro 2, which are included on this list. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works, and they're perfect for people who want ANC without having ear tips jammed in their ears. Want to check them out? Learn more about the model in my full AirPods 4 review. Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Once included on this list, Jabra has discontinued the 2024 Elite 8 Active Gen 2 after announcing it decided to gradually wind down the Jabra Elite product line. Still, we liked their incredible durability (they survived several drops without a scratch) and enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio. They make for great sport earbuds if you can get your hands on them. I have a full Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2 review if you're still interested in the discontinued buds.Bose Ultra Open Earbuds: The Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. While great, I found they had relatively niche use cases, which kept them off this list. Learn more about the novel model in my full Bose Ultra Open Earbuds review. Anker Soundcore Space One: The Soundcore Space One by Anker are a good value for around $100, offering a strong feature set along with good sound quality and performance; still, they can't compete sound-wise with many of the premium models on this list. They lack a bit of that natural, refined quality you look for in a great set of cans, so we kept them off.Beats Solo 4: The $200 Beats Solo 4 are a great pair of on-ear headphones with a strong battery life, USB-C audio, and improved sound and voice-calling performance. Would I pay $200 for them? No, I wouldn't. So they're off this list for now, but keep an eye out for great deals that come around events and holidays. Read more about them in my full Beats Solo 4 review and see if they're right for you.
Headphones FAQ
What's the difference between over-ear, on-ear and in-ear headphones?
Over-ear headphones (also called circumaural headphones) fully surround your ears with large, cushioned ear cups. They typically offer the best noise canceling, sound isolation and comfort for long listening sessions, but are usually bulkier and less portable than other models. On-ear headphones, or supra-aural headphones, have smaller ear cups that sit directly on your ears rather than around them. They're often considered a middle ground between premium sound quality and easy portability, as they're typically smaller and lighter than over-ear headphones without sacrificing audio performance. Still, they may cause some discomfort during extended use.In-ear headphones, also known as earbuds or IEMs, fit directly into your ear canal. They're often lightweight, portable and ideal for on-the-go use. Audio purists and the most discerning listeners will say earbuds make major sacrifices when it comes to sound quality, though most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference. They may also cause fatigue and discomfort faster than other options due to their invasive design.

How do I choose between wireless and wired headphones?
Generally, wired headphones offer better sound quality as their higher bandwidth allows for uncompressed, lossless audio. Since they're not battery powered and don't rely on Bluetooth to stay connected to your device, they're also more reliable for long listening sessions. But remember -- newer phones often don't have a headphone jack, so you won't be able to use wired headphones to listen from your your phone (unless you get Lightning or USB-C headphones or use an adapter).On the other hand, wireless headphones provide freedom of movement for on-the-go listening. They're perfect for athletes, commuters or anyone who wants a sleek look with their audio gear. Modern Bluetooth codecs like aptX and LDAC have also significantly narrowed the sound quality gap between wired and wireless headphones, though wired headphones still reign supreme. At the end of the day, it comes down to which model is best suited for your usage. Think about how you'll use your headphones: If you're an audiophile, studio professional or gamer that needs reference-quality audio, wired headphones may be best for you. But if convenience and modern features matter more to you, a wireless model is likely the better choice. If you still can't decide, remember that many models on this list and beyond offer both wired and wireless connectivity for the best of both worlds.

How important is noise cancellation for everyday use?
If you're looking to muffle ambient sound from the outside world, noise canceling is a feature you'll want in your headphones. For commuters, frequent flyers or office workers, active noise cancellation can be valuable. It'll block out consistent background sounds like subway noise, air conditioning hums and coworker chatter so you can enjoy your music at lower volumes and limit listening fatigue. It's not for everyone, though; if you plan on using your headphones in quiet environments or during focused activities, you may not notice much of a benefit from ANC. Some listeners even find that noise cancellation creates a slight pressure on their ears or affects sound quality.If you're thinking about snagging a pair of noise-canceling headphones, consider the following: Battery life is generally lower with ANC enabled, ANC headphones often come with a higher price tag, and ANC really works best on consistent, low-frequency sounds rather than sudden noises like alarms. Also remember that many ANC headphones offer adjustable or toggle-able noise cancellation to turn it on and off at will. For most people, noise cancellation adds enough value to the listening experience to justify the expense. But if other features or budget take priority, it's not make-or-break.

Are expensive headphones really worth the price difference?
It depends on your priorities, listening habits and how discerning your musical ear is. While the jump from a $100 to a $500 pair of headphones will certainly be noticeable, there comes a point of diminishing returns. You've also got to question yourself where you intend to use the headphones while making your buying decision. For example, would you truly benefit from the added fidelity of an ultra high-end pair of headphones on your morning commute? The most dramatic improvements typically occur in the $50 to $200 range, where you'll notice clearer vocals, better instrument separation, more accurate bass response and improved overall balance. Moving up to $500 brings more refined details, a wider soundstage and better build quality, but these differences become exponentially more subtle as you increase in price. Beyond $500, you're often paying for specialized tuning, premium materials, brand prestige or features that appeal mainly to audiophiles and audio professionals.
