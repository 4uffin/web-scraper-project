How we test
What to consider
Budget
Determine how much you're willing to spend on wireless earbuds and how that lines up with quality and functionality.
Fit
Your earbuds should offer a comfortable, secure fit. The seal will determine how noise-isolating they are, so keep an eye out for how tight of a seal they provide.
Return Policy
In case the earbuds aren't a great fit for your ears, it's important that the retailer offers a good return policy.
Durability
You want earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important for budget earbuds, which are more susceptible to damage because of their cheaper design.
Performance
You want the best-sounding earbuds with the best sound modes, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend.

What are the best budget earbuds overall? With so many decent budget earbuds available, it's hard to declare one model the best overall. That said, one has to sit at the top of this list, and that currently is the Earfun Air Pro 4, which offers a good combination of features and sound quality for a relatively low price. I recently added the Rosesla Ceramics X buds, which deliver surprisingly good sound for less than $35. Meanwhile, Skullcandy's new Method 360 ANC buds feature Sound by Bose and are essentially a budget version of Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. What We Updated: August 2025We added the new Anker Soundcore P41i buds, which has a charging case that doubles as a power bank that can charge most smartphones up to 50%.Read more: What Makes Cheap Earbuds a Real Value?

Top value noise-canceling earbuds
Earfun Air Pro 4

SCORE
Pros
Impressive overall performance for the price
Very good, slightly warm sound with slight bass push that can be tweaked in user-friendly companion app
Decent noise canceling and background noise reduction for voice calling
Support for AAC, AptX and LDAC audio codecs
Robust feature set (wireless charging, ear-detection sensors, multipoint Bluetooth 5.4)
Cons
Touch controls are a bit finicky
Voice-calling performance could be better in noisier environments
Why I like themEarfun is one of our go-to brands for budget earbuds and its Air Pro 4 buds (read my full review) are one of the better earbuds values out there, which is why I awarded them an CNET Editors' Choice in 2024. While they aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. (Note: Apply the code EAP4CNET at checkout on Amazon to get an additional 10% off).Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091 that supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs.Like their predecessor, the Air 4 Pro are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android, and I did think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much.Reasons to buyAs I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Earfun Air 3 Pro, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case and multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 4 and LE Audio).Reason to skip/keep lookingThe voice-calling performance is slightly improved, but the background noise reduction during calls isn't as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I also thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do. And lastly, I should note that Earfun will release the slightly updated Air 4 Pro Plus this fall, though it'll likely be more expensive than this model at launch.  ... Show more

Top Anker earbuds under $50
Anker Soundcore P40i
Pros
Comfortable fit
Decent sound quality and noise-canceling
Solid voice-calling performance
Good battery life
Case converts into a stand for your phone
Cons
Slightly bass-heavy sound may not appeal to everyone
Why I like themAnker makes so many value earbuds it's hard to keep track of all of them. Released in early 2024, its Soundcore P40i buds are arguably the company's best budget earbuds, with a comfortable fit (they come with six sizes of ear tips) and very solid performance for around $50. Not only do they have decent active noise canceling and as a transparency mode, but they offer multipoint Bluetooth connectivity and respectable voice-calling capabilities. As far as sound goes, they're billed as "bass heavy" earbuds, and indeed, they deliver pretty powerful bass, though it's not boomy or muddy and there is ample detail. You can tweak the sound a bit in the sound profile, but I mainly stuck to the earbuds' "signature sound," which I thought worked well with a wide variety of music genres. It's worth noting that these earbuds have a reasonably wide sound stage and low-latency modes for movie watching and gaming.Reasons to buyThese buds are a solid value, and have a bonus feature some people may find useful. The earbuds' charging case converts into a stand for your smartphone when watching video, a feature more earbuds cases should have.Reasons to skip/keep lookingAnker has also released the P41i, which, along with the built-in phone stand, have a built-in power bank to charge your phone (to about 50%), so you may want to check that model out instead.  ...

Impressive sounding earbuds for under $40
Rosesesla Ceramics X
Pros
Inexpensive lightweight buds with a compact case
Exceeded my sound quality expectations for the price
Fairly decent noise-canceling for cheap earbuds
Support the AAC and LDAC audio codecs
Cons
Fairly generic design
Style of bud and fit may not work for some people
Why I like themTruth be told, I'd never heard of the Roseselsa Ceramics X earbuds before I saw a post comparing them to Final Audio's more expensive ZE3000 SV buds that argued the two models are essentially the same. This would make the Ceramics X far better value, but it didn't prove to be quite true. While I ended up liking the Final Audio ZE3000 SV better, I was impressed by the sound quality of the Ceramics for how little they cost. Also, not only did they fit my ears well but I thought their noise canceling was effective and their voice-calling performance was acceptable. They also support the AAC and LDAC audio codecs for Bluetooth playback (many Android smartphones support LDAC).While I thought the treble, bass performance and tonal balance was a touch better with the ZE3000 SV, the Ceramics X serve up good clarity and punchy, well-defined bass that should satisfy most people. The midrange, where voice lives, is a touch forward, which I tend to like. They come in three colors.Reasons to buyFor the price, the Ceramics X exceeded my expectations for sound quality.Reasons to skip/keep lookingSome people prefer earbuds with stems and may not love the fit of these. Also, it's hard to say how long buds like these may last, and a few user reviews on Amazon note some technical glitches; quality control standards aren't always top-notch for budget buds that are based on a predeveloped design by a factory in China.  ...

Best-sounding noise-canceling earbuds under $100
Skullcandy Method 360 ANC
8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Affordable
Impressive sound for the price
Comfortable, secure fit
Decent noise canceling
Good battery life
Cons
Charging case is bulky
Why I like themIn a surprise move, Skullcandy has joined forces with Bose to create what's essentially a budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. With "Sound by Bose," not only do the Method 360 ANC buds sound better than most earbuds in this price class (they sound very similar to Bose's $170 QuietComfort Earbuds), they also fit comfortably and securely thanks to Bose's Fit Kit system that features stability bands to lock the buds in your ears. While they share many of the traits of Bose's flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, they're lighter and lack the more premium finish of those pricey buds. Also, their noise canceling isn't up to the QC Ultra's best-in-class ANC standard. But it's still effective and better than the noise canceling I experienced with previous Skullcandy earbuds I've tested. Read our Skullcandy Method 360 ANC review.Reasons to buyWhile you can find earbuds that sound pretty decent for this price (or a little more), the Method 360 ANC's sound quality is a notch up from what you typically find at this price point. Another selling point is that these buds should fit most ears comfortably and securely thanks to the Bose-like design.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe Method 360 ANC's only potential major drawback is its rather large carrying case and the buds themselves are a little bigger than most. Some people won't mind that the case is bulky, but it may be dealbreaker for some folks. Also, voice-calling performance could be better, but hopefully that will improve with firmware updates.  ...

Best earbuds with power bank built into charging case
Anker Soundcore P41i
Pros
Charging case has a built-in 3,000 mAh battery and USB-C cable for charging smartphones and other devices
Buds are lightweight and comfortable to wear
Decent sound quality with strong bass performance
Case also has built-in standing to prop up your phone
Very good battery life
Cons
Case is a little bulky and heavy
No ear-detection sensors
Case does not charge wirelessly
Why I like themAnker's earlier Soundcore P40 buds have a stand built into their charging case for propping your phone up for video watching. The new-for-2025 P41i not includes an integrated stand but a 3,000-mAh battery and USB-C cable that turns the case into a power bank for charging your phone (owners of older iPhones can also get a version with an integrated Lightning cable that costs $10 more). While the case is a little heavy and bulkier than many earbuds cases, I like the two-devices-in-one concept. Note that while it doesn't offer high-speed charging, it does charge at 10W speeds, which isn't too shabby.As for the buds themselves, while they lack such extra features as ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take a bud out of your ear, they offer decent sound with strong bass performance and decent noise-canceling and voice-calling capabilities. The sound isn't as rich or detailed as what you get with more premium buds, but it's respectably smooth and steers clear of any harshness. Battery life is also good: A single charge gets you up to 10 hours of playback time at moderate volumes with ANC on. And if you don't use the case to charge your phone (it will charge an iPhone 16 to about 50%), it has enough juice to charge the buds around 15 times.Reasons to buy themYou like the idea of combining your earbuds with a power bank to charge your phone in a pinch.Reasons to skip/keep lookingIf you like your earbuds cases small, these probably aren't the buds for you. While the case isn't huge, it's heavier and larger than a lot cases because it does have a 3,000-mAh battery in it. Typically, earbuds charging cases are equipped with 300-mAh to 700-mAh batteries (the AirPods Pro 2's charging case has a 523-mAh battery by comparison).  ... Show more

Apple's entry-level open earbuds
Apple AirPods 4
Pros
Lightweight, more compact design and comfortable fit (should fit more ears securely than Airpods 3)
Improved sound quality with new acoustic architecture
Equipped with Apple's powerful H2 chip that enables a robust feature set and faster digital processing
Compact case
Very good voice-calling performance
Cons
No wireless charging and speaker in charging case for Find My
Even with slightly smaller design, the buds may not be a good fit for some ears
Battery life could be a little better
Why I like themThe AirPods 4 are the fourth generation of Apple's original true-wireless earbuds that feature an open design, which means they don't have silicone eartips like the AirPods Pro 2. Not only do they feature a slightly smaller design and better sound than their predecessor, but they're equipped with Apple's H2 chip that improves overall performance and powers Apple's ever-expanding AirPods features, though they don't have the AirPods Pro 2's Hearing Aid mode. They're among the best-sounding open earbuds. Read my Apple AirPods 4 review.The AirPods 4 come in two versions: an entry-level model ($129) and a step-up model with active noise canceling ($179), wireless charging and a speaker in its case that makes a chirping sound to help you locate the case should you misplace it. While I typically recommend getting the version with ANC -- they're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works -- the entry-level AirPods 4 get regularly discounted to $99 on Amazon (their lowest price to date is $90), which puts them in value territory. Reasons to buySome people don't like having eartips jammed in their ears and find open earbuds more comfortable (plus, you can hear the outside world for safety reasons), and the AirPods 4 are made for those Apple users. As I said, they sound very good for open earbuds and feature excellent voice-calling performance along with Apple's spatial audio and likable pinch controls.Reasons to skip/keep lookingWhile their slightly smaller, updated design fits a wider range of ears more securely, some folks may not get a secure fit. The AirPods Pro 2 offer a more flexible fit because they include four different sizes of eartips. They also deliver better sound with more bass in a noise-isolating design (the AirPods Pro 2's noise canceling is significantly better than that of the AirPods 4 with ANC).  ... Show more

Best budget earbuds from Apple
Beats Solo Buds
Pros
Affordable
Lightweight and comfortable
Very compact case
Good sound and voice-calling performance
Strong battery life
Cons
Few features
No battery or LED charging indicator in charging case
Why I like themAvailable in four color options, the Solo Buds are missing some key features found in more premium buds, including a battery in their very compact charging case, ear-detection sensors and active noise canceling. But they get the fundamentals right. They're lightweight and not only offer decent sound quality and strong battery life but very good voice-calling performance that rivals what you get with the company's more expensive Studio Buds Plus. Read my full review.Reasons to buyThey're the most affordable Beats earbuds and their charging case is quite compact and doesn't take up much room in a pocket. They also have great battery life.Reasons to skip/keep lookingHaving no battery in the case may be a deal-breaker for some people (using a USB-C cable, your phone can supply power to charge the buds in the case, but not everybody likes that concept).  ...

Top value noise-canceling earbuds from Soundpeats
Soundpeats Air5 Pro
Pros
They're affordable, lightweight and comfortable
Sound good for their modest price with decent clarity and strong bass
Decent noise-canceling
Good voice-calling performance
Cons
Missing some features found in the Earfun Air Pro 4
Why I like themThe Soundpeats Air5 Pro buds not only fit comfortably, but they also offer good overall performance, including solid sound quality, for the money. At first glance, they appear similar to the EarFun Air Pro 4. Both are powered by the Qualcomm QCC3091 chip, offer high-resolution audio support (the LDAC audio codec for Android users), have similar driver sizes and are available at comparable prices. The Soundpeats arguably offer a touch better noise canceling and voice-calling performance, however, and some people may prefer their fit. They're a tad lighter, at 4.8 grams per earbud compared to 5.2 grams for the EarFun buds, and have an integrated triangle vent to "help reduce in-ear pressure." On the flip side, the EarFun Air Pro 4 buds have some features missing from the Soundpeats. They include ear-detection sensors, wireless charging, Google Fast Pair and Auracast, which allows you to tune into audio broadcasts over Bluetooth, say from a TV at your gym.Reasons to buyThe Air5 Pro are good value alternative to the AirPods Pro 2.Reasons to skip/keep lookingFrom a features standpoint, the Earfun Pro 4 have some advantages and they cost around the same price. I also preferred the eartips that come with the Earfun Pro 4.  ... Show more

Solid noise-canceling earbuds for less than $50
QCY MeloBuds Pro
Pros
Affordable
Lightweight and comfortable
Good sound for the price
Ear-detection sensors and support for LDAC audio codec
Cons
Generic look and feel
Touch controls are a little finicky
Why I like themLike Earfun, QCY makes a variety of budget earbuds and headphones that deliver good bang for your buck. The MeloBuds Pro look a little generic, but they're lightweight and comfortable and sound good for what they cost, offering decent clarity and well-balanced audio (you can tweak their sound profile a bit with the EQ settings in the QCY companion app). Also, they're noise-canceling and voice-calling performance are better than average for sub-$50 earbuds. And finally, they have ear-detection sensors, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, a low-latency gaming mode and support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec (many Android devices support LDAC).Battery life is rated at up to 7.5 hours at moderate volumes with noise canceling on, though it dips to around 4.5 hours if you're using the LDAC codec for streaming over Bluetooth. Sweat-resistant and splash-proof with an IPX5 rating, the QCY MeloBuds Pro may not do anything exceptionally well -- and I found their touch controls a bit finicky -- but they're overall a good value, especially when they go on sale for closer to $40.Reasons to buyThey may not be total budget standouts but they sound as good or slightly better than the competition in this price range and have some features like ear-detections sensors not always found at this price point.Reasons to skip/keep lookingThe MeloBuds Pro are pretty generic and a small fraction of user reviews on Amazon note that the buds have had technical issues over time and haven't held up as well as they hoped.

The Soundcore by Anker Liberty 4 NC feature improved noise canceling David Carnoy/CNET
Top value Anker earbuds
Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC
Pros
Lightweight fit with four ear tip sizes to choose from for a tight seal
Good sound with single custom drivers that deliver smooth treble and strong bass performance
User-friendly companion app is available on both iOS and Android to tweak sound profile
Decent call quality with six integrated mics to reduce background noise for clear voice transmission
Robust feature set including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging
Cons
Noise canceling could be a little better
Sound quality isn't quite as good as what you get from a set of premium earbuds
Why I like themReleased in 2023, the Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC earbuds carry a lower list price than 2022's Liberty 4 buds and are arguably better in some ways. They have improved noise cancellation and better sound quality, along with support for the LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. (Many Android smartphones do, and in theory it offers slightly improved sound quality when paired with a music streaming service that offers high-res tracks.) They're lightweight buds that should fit most ears comfortably with four sizes of ear tips to choose from. The Liberty 4 NC buds have single custom drivers compared to the Liberty 4's dynamic dual drivers -- and a completely different case design -- but I thought they delivered more pleasant sound than the Liberty 4s. Their treble is a little smoother and they feature strong bass performance. They came across as fairly open, with a reasonably wide soundstage. You can tweak the sound profile in the companion app for iOS and Android. The buds come in several color options and are IPX4 splash-proof, so they're suitable for running and gym use. They feature excellent battery life -- up to 10 hours on a single charge at moderate volume levels -- and there's also a transparency mode that lets ambient sound in and sounds pretty natural with only a very faint audible hiss. While the noise canceling is an improvement over the Liberty 4's and is effective, it falls a bit short of what you get from Bose's and Sony's premium ANC earbuds. Like the Liberty 4, the earbuds have six integrated mics for noise cancellation and making calls, and callers said they thought the buds did a pretty good job of reducing background noise, with my voice coming through relatively clearly. They're an all-around good performing set of buds for the money, and they offer a strong feature set, including ear-detection sensors and wireless charging.Reasons to buyWhile they've been out a couple of years, the Liberty 4 NC remain a decent value, priced about $30-$40 lower than the newer Liberty 5.Reasons to skip/keep lookingAnker's has released the newer Soundcore Liberty 5 in 2025 that have some small performance upgrades, particularly to noise canceling and voice-calling performance.

Top affordable clip-on earbuds
Baseus Bowie MC1
Pros
Affordable
Comfortable, secure fit
Decent sound
Good battery life
Cons
Somewhat generic design
Distort a little at higher volumes
Baseus is known for its value earbuds, power banks and charging products. While its Bowie MC1 aren't in the same league as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, they cost around a sixth of the price and sound pretty decent for this style of of clip-on earbuds, particularly with less demanding tracks that don't feature heavy bass and a lot of instruments playing at the same time. On Amazon, you'll find clip-on buds with a similar design, including the Tozo OpenEarRing ($40) and Amazfit Up ($50), so they're a little generic. But I found the sound quality to be slightly better many competing clip-on value buds. I also liked that they have a single physical control button on each bud for controlling playback and adjusting volume levels.Battery life is rated for up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels, which is good, but expect to get les than that because you do tend to have to listen to open earbuds at higher volumes, especially in noisier environments. With an IP57 certification, the buds are splash-proof and dust-proof, making them suitable for runners and bikers. Voice-calling capabilities are also decent though don't expect business-class performance.  ... Show more

Best value earbuds with hooks
Soundcore by Anker X20
Pros
Upgraded design from X10
Secure, comfortable fit
Slightly better sound and noise canceling
Improved battery life
Fully waterproof and dust-proof
Cons
Lack a bit of clarity
Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal
Why I like themThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. However, they don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.Fully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 have slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent thought not exceptionally good.Reasons to buyIf you like the concept of the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 but don't want to pay $249 for them (yes, they do regularly go on sale, but they list for $249), the X2 are a good alternative for a lot less money.Reasons to skip/keep lookingSome people prefer an open design (that lets sound in from the outside world) in a set of ear-hook style earbuds. Not everybody will get a tight seal from these earbuds.  ... Show more

Add to compareFactors to consider when choosing budget wireless earbuds
BudgetBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out just how "budget" your budget wireless earbuds should be. Value priced earbuds continue to improve, so you can find good "cheap" buds for not too much money, like many on this list. But if you're looking for more premium budget earbuds from Sony, Apple and Bose, be prepared to upwards of $60.FitIt's key that the earbuds you buy fit your ears well. They should offer a comfortable, secure fit. If you don't get a tight seal with noise-isolating earbuds, sound quality and noise canceling can be dramatically impacted for the worse. Open earbuds don't have that issue, but they should be comfortable to wear and sit securely in your ears.DurabilityYou want earbuds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality. This is especially important with budget earbuds, which are more susceptible to damage because of their design. PerformanceYou want the best-sounding earbuds with the best sound modes, call quality and features for whatever you're able to spend.Return PolicyIt's critical to buy your budget earbuds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one. How we test budget true-wireless earbuds
We test budget true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.DesignWe assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings, which are especially important for budget earbuds and headphones you may take to the gym.Sound qualityEven budget earbuds can still deliver great sounding audio. We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment. Some of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit.FeaturesMany budget earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.Voice-calling performanceWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice. This is especially important for those who want a cheaper earbud to throw in their work bag. The best wireless earbuds for voice calling pick up your voice clearly while significantly reducing background noise. Onboard microphones, sophisticated noise-reduction algorithms and voice accelerometers that detect when you're speaking all factor into call quality. Plus, a sidetone feature allows you to hear your own voice when chatting with noise-isolating buds, helping you avoid talking too loudly. If you're looking for a broader selection of headphones that fit this bill, check out our roundup of the best earbuds for making phone calls.ValueWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class. Because many of these models fall into a similar price range, we break the price classes further to ensure they're matched appropriately. Great sounding, feature-packed headphones that offer a great bang for your buck earn top marks in this category.

Our reviewer David Carnoy testing voice-calling performance on the noisy streets of New York.  David Carnoy/CNET Other budget wireless earbuds we've tested
Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2: Anker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 used to be on list but their list price has risen from $100 to $130, so I had to pull them off. These open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes these $40 Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound (they're a little more behind the AirPods 4, which offer improved sound from the AirPods 3). On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof.Amazon Echo Buds (2023): Amazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears. Their sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 4, which deliver better bass performance and overall fuller, cleaner sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 4, even the entry-level model ($129), cost significantly more.Jabra Elite 4: The lightweight Elite 4 fit my ears comfortably and offered good, well-balanced sound with punchy bass and decent clarity. They support Qualcomm's aptX audio codec (for Android and other devices that support aptX) but only the SBC codec for iPhones (no AAC support). The Elite 4 is missing more premium features like ear detection sensors and has a four-microphone array for noise canceling and voice calls (voice-calling performance is good but not exceptionally good). What's a little confusing is that Jabra also sells the Elite 4 Active, a slightly more ruggedized version of the same buds that carries a list price of $120 but sometimes sells for less than the standard Elite 4. So get the Elite 4 Active if it costs less.JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging. JBL Live Free 2: Like the Live Pro 2, JBL's new Live Free 2 buds are surprisingly good. With 11mm drivers, six microphones, oval tubes and oval silicon tips, they combine a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance. Features include multipoint Bluetooth pairing and wireless charging, and they're rated for up to seven hours with IPX5 water-resistance (splash-proof).Beats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio Buds look a lot like the rumored stemless AirPods some people have been waiting for. Geared toward both iOS and Android users, they are missing a few key features on the Apple side of things (there's no H1 or W1 chip), but they're small, lightweight buds that are comfortable to wear and offer really good sound. While their noise canceling isn't as good as the AirPods Pro's, they do have a transparency mode and they're decent for making calls. Read our Beats Studio Buds review.Sennheiser CX: If you can't afford Sennheiser's flagship Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, the CX are a good alternative. They feature very good sound, plus decent noise canceling and voice-calling performance. The only issue is they stick out of your ears a bit and may not fit some smaller ears. This model, which often sells for less than $100 on Amazon, doesn't feature active noise canceling but the step-up CX Plus does (the CX Plus is also a good value, particularly when it goes on sale). Learn more about the budget earbuds in my full Sennheiser CX true wireless earbuds review.
Budget wireless earbuds FAQs
Do cheap earbuds sound as good as the AirPods 3rd Gen and AirPods Pro 2?
Apple improved the sound quality of the third-gen AirPods so it raised the bar. That said, many true wireless earbuds that cost less than $100 or even less than $50 offer surprisingly good sound for the money and measure up pretty well against the AirPods and AirPods Pro, although not the AirPods Pro 2, which offer significantly improved sound.
Show more
What are the biggest differences between cheaper buds and more premium buds?
Often, the biggest difference is build quality. Premium buds tend to feel sturdier and tend to be built with more premium materials. They also have a more premium look and feel to both the buds themselves and their charging case. In theory, premium buds should hold up better over time. Additionally, they tend to have more features such as ear-detection sensors and they pair with a companion app so you can upgrade the firmware (as well as tweak the sound and possibly customize the controls). Finally, while some cheaper buds have active noise cancellation, the performance of the noise-canceling and transparency modes tends to be better with more premium buds.
Show more
Do cheap earbuds work well for making voice calls?
Some do. Many cheaper buds now feature multiple microphones and some do a surprisingly good job when it comes to voice calling. A few models on this list have surprisingly good noise reduction and measure up well against the AirPods, which are known for their strong voice-calling performance.
Show more
How can I make my cheap earbuds sound better?
There are several ways to improve the sound of even the cheapest earbuds. Here are just a few: Ensure the proper fit. The buds should be positioned to send sound waves directly into the ear canal with minimal sound leakage, even with open models. If you feel like your earbuds don't fit properly, you may want to consider adding ear foam or silicone ear tips or looking for a new model altogether. Use the EQ settings on your device. Because each person hears audio differently or has different sensitivities to tones like bass and treble, small adjustments to EQ can ensure your budget earbuds sound best for your individual listening needs. Most devices allow for EQ editing in their settings, while streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music allow for in-app adjustments.
Clean and inspect your earbuds regularly. Ear wax and oils naturally build up on your earbuds as you wear them. That build-up can change the quality of the sound overtime. Regularly cleaning your earbuds with tools like a soft lint-free cloth, tooth picks, cotton swabs and soft-bristled brushes can remove build-up and keep your earbuds clear. As you clean, inspect your earbuds for any visible damage to the cable or earpieces that could affect audio quality. We also have a full article on how to clean your AirPods that also applies to other earbuds, but consider this the condensed version. Consider using outside equipment. If possible, you can try using a detailed music player with higher-quality audio output than your current source. Adding new ear tips that better direct sound or using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) are other options to improve your listening experience.
