How we test
What to Consider
iOS or Android
If your family and friends are on Apple services like iMessage and FaceTime, stick with an iPhone. If you’ve been deep on Samsung, stay on Android. Know that switching between the two has never been easier.
Size
Phones are big in general with the smallest ones having a 6.1-inch screen and large models topping out at 6.8 inches. That makes visiting a store and trying a phone out before you buy it quite important.
Cameras
Phone cameras have gotten better over the past five years, but don’t be fooled by how many cameras a phone has; more is not necessarily better.
Software support
Phone-makers promise varying lengths of long-term software and security support ranging from just one year to as many as seven. These updates not only ensure you get many of the latest features but also keep your phone secure.

In 2025 affordable phones come brimming with features and options from companies like Motorola, Google, Samsung and Apple. After testing and reviewing dozens of cheap handsets, we found there are two pricing sweet spots: $300 and $450. Phones that cost $300 tend to have NFC (for Google Pay), wireless charging and good screen -- though cameras can be hit-or-miss, like the $300 Motorola Moto G Power (2024). In the $450 range are phones have solid cameras and features that rival pricier models like the $499 Google Pixel 8A, which won CNET's Editor's Choice Award. Out of everything we tested, here are our favorite cheap phones from both price ranges. Our Picks

What is the best cheap phone?
James Martin/CNETThe Google's $499 Pixel 8A is our favorite cheap phone. Google delivers all the big features that matter on the Pixel 8A, like top-of-the-line cameras, a peppy processor and years' worth of software support. And it even has Google's new Circle to Search tool, which is a fast and fun way to trigger a search just by circling what's on your screen. Google makes smart compromises to keep costs low making the Pixel 8A a phone that packs an incredible amount of value. We should note that Google announced the Pixel 9A which launches in April. We look forward to testing it and if you're considering a Pixel 8A and can wait, it might be worth going for the new Pixel 9A instead.Best cheap phones of 2025

Best Android phone under $500
Google Pixel 8A
Pros
Great camera
7 years of software updates
Many of the same features as the Pixel 8
Good battery life
Cons
256GB storage not available on all models
Zoomed and low light shots aren't as clear as the Pixel 8's
The Pixel 8A is so good and shares so much in common with its pricier siblings. From its selection of AI-powered features like Circle to Search to its cool aesthetic and powerful Tensor G3 processor, that it’s hard to see why anyone would not buy a Pixel 8A.The Pixel 8 and 9 offer a marginally better camera system, a slightly larger screen and the ability to charge other phones and accessories wirelessly on the back of the device. But those features don’t feel significant enough to impact the buying decision for most people. As I wrote in my review, the Pixel 8A raises the bar for what a $500 phone should be. It also won a CNET Editor's Choice Award.  ... Show more

Motorola Moto G Power (2024)
Pros
NFC/Google Pay
Good battery life
Wireless charging
Moto shortcuts
Cons
Short software support timeline
Screen is too dim in sunlight
Lacks IP rating for dust and water resistance
The Motorola Moto G Power 5G is the most versatile option in this roundup, offering wireless charging, a 120Hz high refresh rate screen, Google Pay for contactless payments and a fantastic vegan leather design. Combine that with a camera that takes decent photos in bright environments, and a processor that is capable for most daily tasks, and you have a phone that’s both fun to use without cramming itself with the extra bells and whistles we see in higher priced phones.Even though this phone does suffer from having a shorter software and security support timeline (1 year of major Android OS, three years of security updates) than Samsung’s Galaxy A25 5G, it is a more useful device. And it's this appeal that makes the Moto G Power 5G our top recommendation for a phone that costs $300 or less.  ... Show more

Needs more iOS features for the Plus' larger screen
Apple no longer sells the iPhone 14 and the new iPhone 16E replaces its $599 price point. But many shopping sites still sell the iPhone 14 for as low as $359. a great buy and solid upgrade, especially if you're using an 11 or older. There are two models the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 and the 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus that normally starts at $699. Both phones are identical and really the deciding factor comes down to screen and battery size as well as price. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have a long battery life, fast performance, great durability and wonderful cameras as well as safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite.Both phones came out in September 2022 originally but are still solid options today. In terms of drawbacks, neither phone has a high refresh rate screen, and always-on display or the newer Action button found on the 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series. But at hundreds of dollars less, we think that the iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have the best value to the dollar that Apple currently sells. Read our full iPhone 14 review.  ... Show more

OnePlus 13R
Pros
Big screen
Loud speakers
Long-lasting battery
Fast wired charging
Cons
No wireless charging
Mixed photography
The $600 OnePlus 13R is one of the most useful phones we've tested, even if it's playing second fiddle to the $900 OnePlus 13. Over his three-week testing period, CNET's Mike Sorrentino consistently got two full days of use from its 6,000mAh battery. The phone's big 6.78-inch screen and loud speakers are a joy to use when paired to my Xbox controller while gaming. Even though it runs on Qualcomm's year-old premium processor used in 2024's OnePlus 12 and the Galaxy S24, it's still a very capable chip ready for intensive tasks and AI features. All in all, the OnePlus 13R packs a lot for its lower price. At $600 it's a decent phone, but we included it on this list because you can often find it on sale for less.

Samsung Galaxy A03S
Pros
3GB of RAM helps phone multitask
Blue color option
Includes fingerprint sensor
Cons
Very little onboard storage
Some noticeable lag
Indoor photos are challenging
Samsung's Galaxy A03S at $160 (£126, roughly AU$244) includes great features and could be a fit for someone in need of a cheap phone that can handle essential tasks. The phone's 6.5-inch screen, capped at 720p resolution, is great for reading the news, watching videos and playing games. Despite some performance lag during our review, the phone is good at multitasking. The tiny 32GB of storage space could fill up fast, so if you're considering this phone, you might want to expand the storage with a microSD card.Samsung also plans to support this phone with at least four years of security updates, which in this price range is as good as it gets. On the software side, it's less clear how many Android versions are scheduled, but the phone initially ships with Android 11.  ... Show more

Best cheap phone design
Motorola Moto G 5G (2024)
Pros
Vegan leather design
NFC for contactless payments
Decent cameras for the price
Cons
Slow performance
Dull-looking screen
Only one software update planned
Motorola’s $200 Moto G 5G for 2024 arrived with a splash. The phone kept many highlights of the 2023 model like a 120Hz refresh rate screen and dual speakers while also getting a $50 price drop. The Moto G 5G also has an improved design and functionality with a new vegan leather look and NFC for contactless payments. And its cameras can take photos with decent color accuracy, despite soft details.But performance and a short software update timeline both hurt the Moto G 5G. While the phone is capable of running all sorts of apps and games, multitasking on its small 4GB of RAM is challenging. Also Motorola has not budged from its policy of providing one major software update and three years of security updates to the Moto G line, which limits the number of years you can safely use the phone before needing to replace it.  ...

Best Android phone on sale
Google Pixel 7A
Pros
Excellent camera for the price
Attractive design
Wireless charging, face unlock and high refresh rate
Cons
Screen is dim outdoors
Only three generations of Android OS updates
Editor's note: Google released the Pixel 8A, also $500. You can read our Pixel 8A review here. If you're buying a Pixel 7A make sure it's on sale.Google's budget phone took a leap forward in 2023 with the Pixel 7A, which offers many of the same benefits as the Pixel 7 but at a cheaper price. Like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A runs on Google's Tensor G2 processor, meaning it has many of the same photo editing and language translation features as its pricier sibling. The Pixel 7A's 64-megapixel camera also takes excellent photos that rival the Pixel 7's in quality. While we still like the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7A's lower price makes it a better deal for most people. Otherwise, the main differences between the Pixel 7 and 7A come down to the former's more durable build, slightly faster charging and its ability to wirelessly charge compatible accessories. The Pixel 7 also has a larger camera sensor that's more sensitive to light, according to Google, but CNET's Lisa Eadicicco didn't notice much of a difference.  ... Show more

Best ultra cheap T-Mobile phone
TCL 50 XL 5G
Pros
Great screen for $160
NFC support for Google Pay
Decent multitasking for the price
Cons
T-Mobile exclusivity
Battery drains fast
Weak cameras
The TCL 50 XL 5G includes an impressive amount of specs for $160. This is one of the cheapest phones I’ve seen so far that includes a 120Hz refresh rate display and NFC for Google Pay and contactless payments. It also includes 6GB of memory, which made the phone breeze through multitasking during my testing. But the TCL 50 XL 5G does show compromises from its low price in other ways.Even though it has a big 5,010-mAh battery, it drains quickly -- possibly because it’s powering a large 6.78-inch 1080p display with a low-end processor. Cameras struggle to take photos with clean, crisp details, in both well-lit and lowlight situations. It’s carrier-locked to T-Mobile as well, making it only useful when running on the magenta carrier or its Metro prepaid brand. And it’s also only set for one software update and three years of security updates, which matches what Motorola provides but is still low compared to Samsung. But if you're on T-Mobile, the TCL 50 XL 5G is a serious value for its $160, and helps excuse some of its faults. But you should still be aware of them.  ... Show more

Best ultracheap phone for long-term use
Samsung Galaxy A15 5G
Pros
Excellent software and security support
25-watt wired charging
Eye-catching Light Blue color option
Cons
Slow performance
Single audio speaker
Mediocre photography
Editor's Note: Samsung has also released the Galaxy A16.Samsung’s $200 Galaxy A15 5G is an easy choice for someone looking to buy a phone that will last for years. Samsung provides it with four years of software updates and five years of security support, which in this price range is unparalleled. Plus the phone supports 25W wired charging that in my testing was able to charge half of its big 5,000-mAh battery from empty in 30 minutes. I also like the eye-catching light blue option.A $200 phone has to have some compromises. The Galaxy A15 5G feels sluggish compared to competing phones like Motorola’s $200 Moto G 5G, and as an entertainment machine falls short with its single audio speaker that is blocked by accident when you hold the phone sideways for games and video. Photography, which is typically a weak point on phones in this price range, is similarly mixed with decent photography in outdoor environments while struggling to photograph lowlight spaces. Read our full Samsung Galaxy A15 5G review.Why we like itThe Samsung Galaxy A15 5G is a stalwart, functional choice when all you want is a stable phone. The A15's photo processing is decent for a phone in this price range. The photos I took outdoors look vivid, with enough detail that I'd be happy to post them on social networks. In a good way, the battery drains slowly and recharges fairly quickly thanks to its 25-watt wired charging.Who's it best forIf you're looking for a low-cost phone that will be easy and safe to use for years, the A15 is an easy choice.Who shouldn’t get itIf you don't mind possibly needing a new phone in two or three years, the $200 Moto G 5G and the $160 TCL 50 XL have better-looking displays that look smoother at their 120Hz refresh rates  ...

Recent updates
In January 2025, we added the OnePlus 13R to our list. The new phones replace last year's OnePlus 12R and is a decent midrange Android phone that is best bought when on sale. Factors to consider when buying a cheap phone
Try it before you buy it: It's one thing to ogle over a phone, but it's another to actually try it out in a store.Decide on Android or iPhone: Do you have a lot of iPhone apps and Apple subscriptions? Stick with an iPhone. Likewise, if you've invested in loads of Android apps, you'll want to stay on that side of the fence. Otherwise, it's simple enough to switch platforms.Pick the most important feature: Is it screen size? Camera quality? Battery life? This will help narrow down your choices. How we test phones
Every phone on this list has been thoroughly tested by CNET's expert reviews team. We use the phone, test the features, play games and take photos. We assess any marketing promises that a company makes about its phones. If we find something we don't like -- be it battery life or build quality -- we tell you about it. We examine every aspect of a phone during testing:DisplayDesign and feelProcessor performanceBattery lifeCamera qualityFeatures
In-person the yellow has a soft pastel tone. Patrick Holland/CNETWe test all the phone's cameras (both front and back) in a variety of conditions: from outdoors under sunlight to dimmer indoor locales and nighttime scenes (for any available night modes). We also compare our findings against similarly priced models. We have a series of real-world battery tests to see how long a phone lasts under everyday use.We account for additional phone features like 5G, fingerprint and face readers, styluses, fast charging, foldable displays and other useful extras. We weigh all our experiences and testing against the price so you know whether a phone represents good value.Read more: How We Test Phones Other phones to consider
At $700, the iPhone 15 isn't necessarily considered cheap. Compared to the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, it's much more affordable. In 2025, the iPhone 15 is still one of the best Apple phones you can buy. It has a 6.1-inch screen, great dual-rear cameras and an outstanding battery life. It's worth a look if you can work it into your budget. Best cheap phones FAQs
Can you find cheap phones on sale?
Yes, many of the cheap phones included in this list are available at a discount during shopping events. For instance, the Google Pixel 7A's price can drop as low as $350 when it's on sale. If you have a phone in mind but also have the flexibility to hold off for a shopping event like Black Friday, it may be worth it to wait for a price reduction.

Are cheap phones available unlocked?
Yes, many cheap phones are available unlocked by the manufacturer. This allows you to use the phone with nearly any wireless carrier by inserting your SIM card or transferring your eSIM. If you want the flexibility to switch carriers, make sure you buy an unlocked model.

Are cheap phones good for kids?
Buying a cheap phone could be a great option when shopping for a kid or teenager, but that doesn't mean the phone is customized to have a kid-friendly experience. Parents should still set up any necessary parental controls, restrictions or apps on an iPhone or Android to make sure it's appropriate for kids.

What to look forward to in 2025?
We are in the middle of "budget phone season" with new affordable phones being released by Google, Motorola and Samsung. We look forward to testing them all once we can get our hands on them. Otherwise, later this summer we'll see the start of "flagship phone season" with major releases from Apple and Google.
