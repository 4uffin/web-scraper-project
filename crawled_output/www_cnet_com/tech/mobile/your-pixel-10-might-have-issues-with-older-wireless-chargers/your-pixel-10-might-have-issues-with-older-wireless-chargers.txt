Your Pixel 10 Might Have Issues With Older Wireless Chargers
You might want to try taking the case off your phone to successfully charge it.
Blake Stimac Writer Blake has over a decade of experience writing for the web, with a focus on mobile phones, where he covered the smartphone boom of the 2010s and the broader tech scene. When he's not in front of a keyboard, you'll most likely find him playing video games, watching horror flicks, or hunting down a good churro.

Wireless charging issues have been reported with the latest Pixel 10 phones. Andrew Lanxon/CNET
When Google introduced the Pixel 10 lineup in August, it became one of the first major Android phones to receive the Qi 2 wireless charging standard, which Google calls Pixelsnap. However, almost immediately after the Pixel 10's release, people noticed issues with its wireless charging. Some people are having trouble charging their phone with the new Pixelsnap charger, and others are having issues with older wireless chargers, including Google's own Pixel Stands. The bulk of the problems happen when a case is on the phone -- whether it has the magnet array or not.
This is the only way I've been able to charge my Pixel 10 Pro XL on the original Pixel Stand when it has a case on it.  Blake Stimac/CNETI own both the first- and second-generation Pixel Stands, and both will charge my Pixel 10 Pro XL without an issue if there's no case on it. However, when I add a case to my phone, the problems begin. I have three cases for my phone, the Mous Super Thin Clear Case, the Magnetic Slim Case Fit by Grecazo and a no-name soft TPU case. If my phone has any of those cases on, and I attempt to charge it while it's vertical, it starts to charge and then stops after a second or two and keeps doing that. I can fix this for the first-generation Pixel Stand by turning the phone horizontal, but it will still charge very slowly. I can't seem to fix it at all for the Pixel Stand 2 -- vertical, horizontal, it doesn't charge. Not everyone has this issueThe problem doesn't seem to be universal. CNET editor Patrick Holland said he had no issues charging the Pixel 10 Pro during his time with it. A Google spokesperson told me the Pixel 10 lineup is not optimized for older Qi wireless charging standards, but that doesn't necessarily mean the phones won't work with older wireless chargers. Qi 2 is backward-compatible with older standards, but the phone's height and charging coil placement on both the phone and the charger are still factors. If you're having problems, you might see if removing the case helps.The prospect of needing to replace your older wireless chargers with newer ones isn't ideal, especially if you shelled out $80 for one or both of Google's own Pixel Stands. Still, if you want the best wireless charging speed for your brand new Pixel 10 phone, it won't be with wireless chargers that support only older Qi standards.
