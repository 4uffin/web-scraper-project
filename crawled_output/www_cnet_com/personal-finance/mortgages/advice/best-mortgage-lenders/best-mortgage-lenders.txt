Choosing the right mortgage lender could save you tens of thousands of dollars in loan costs, whether in the form of a lower interest rate or more affordable closing costs. You also want to seek out a lender who puts you at ease by providing expert guidance and streamlining the loan process. Although mortgage rates are starting to fall, you don’t need to rush out and go with the first lender you find. Instead, I recommend comparing loan offers from at least two to three different lenders before making your decision. Each one will offer different rates and loan terms based on factors like your credit score, income and down payment, so it can pay to shop around. I also know that with hundreds of lending options available, starting the process can be overwhelming. So I did some of the heavy lifting for you and rounded up 10 of the best mortgage lenders to help you find your match. To do so, I evaluated dozens of banks, credit unions and online lenders based on various factors, including pricing transparency, accessibility, range of loan types and customer satisfaction.
“While mortgage rates may continue to trend down in the coming months, it’ll be a slow process, so don’t expect a big drop right away. Instead, think about whether it makes sense to lock in a lower, but not perfect, rate now or wait for rates to fall further over time.”
Matt Vernon, Head of consumer lending at Bank of America

How to find the best mortgage lender for your situation
Outside of price and lender reliability, narrowing down your choice comes down to what is best for you and your personal circumstances. Depending on your goals and needs as a borrower, one lender could be a better fit than another. For example, a first-time homebuyer struggling to meet down payment requirements can look into lenders with down payment assistance programs. Another borrower may have a low credit score and need a lender with a lower credit threshold.Here are some factors to consider when choosing a mortgage lender.Types of mortgages available
One of the first steps in choosing a lender is figuring out who offers the type of mortgage you need.
If you have blemishes on your credit report, like bankruptcy, then an FHA loan is likely to be easier to qualify for than conventional loans. Other loans, such as USDA and VA loans, offer 100% financing with no down payment required, although some lenders may have their own down payment requirements.
The loan repayment term can also affect the lender you choose. Most lenders offer 15-year or 30-year mortgages, but if you want a 10-year or a 40-year mortgage, your options will be more limited. Loan officer experience
The biggest mortgage lenders have hundreds of locations and are staffed by thousands of loan originators. So, within the same lender, you could have a wildly different experience depending on the individual loan officer you work with.
Talk with a loan officer to evaluate their experience that could be relevant to your situation. For example, if you’re applying for a VA loan or FHA loan, try working with a loan officer who’s familiar with those types of mortgages. Homebuyer assistance programs
These programs can provide you with thousands of dollars to put toward your down payment and closing costs. For many first-time homebuyers, this assistance is critical. As you’re comparing lenders, be sure to ask if they have these types of programs.
"Don’t get distracted by just the rate. A lot of buyers fall into the trap of rate shopping without considering the full picture -- like closing costs, lender fees, their monthly payment and the kind of service they’re getting. In a competitive market, working with a lender who can close deals fast and communicate well with all parties can make or break your offer."
Nicole Rueth, SVP of the Rueth Team Powered by Movement Mortgage
Why it’s important to compare offers from multiple lenders
Comparing offers is important because each lender will evaluate your financial situation differently. First, you’ll want to compare credit unions, banks and mortgage brokers. Provide the same information to each lender to get a more accurate comparison.Second, make sure you receive a loan estimate form — a document that outlines the interest rates and fees — from each lender. Lenders must adhere to what they disclose on a loan estimate, protecting you from any fee increases later on in the process.To secure the best rate, fees and terms, compare at least three different quotes.Comparing ratesA difference of 0.50% on your mortgage rate doesn’t sound like much, but it can save you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.Take this example on a 30-year fixed, $300,000 loan: Interest rate Monthly principal and interest payment Total interest over loan’s life Loan A 3.6% $1,363 $191,285 Loan B 3.1% $1,281 $161,189With this example, a 0.50% difference in interest rate is the difference of $82 a month. Over a 30-year loan, that difference amounts to $30,096 in interest.Comparing lender feesSecuring the lowest interest rate isn’t the only factor to consider when comparing mortgage lenders. Two lenders can advertise the same mortgage rate but charge wildly different closing fees. A low rate with high closing costs can eat away at the savings you were supposed to get.One way to evaluate the difference between offers is to look at a mortgage loan APR. The APR factors in many of the loan’s fees, in addition to the interest rate, over the loan’s full term.Take this example on a 30-year fixed, $200,000 loan: Interest rate Closing costs APR Loan A 3.000% $6,000 3.233% Loan B 3.125% $2,000 3.204%Loan A is the more tempting offer since it has a lower interest rate, but it has higher lender fees. Loan B may be overlooked because of its higher interest rate, but it has lower lender fees and a lower overall APR.The best approach is to do research, narrow down to two or three lenders, get prequalified with each one and compare the loan estimates side by side. Pro Tip Each application may trigger a hard inquiry on your credit reports, but credit-scoring companies know consumers shop around. Experian will treat all mortgage inquiries made within 30 days as just one inquiry. FICO will do the same within a 45-day period. Try to submit your mortgage applications within this window to minimize the impact on your credit. Mortgage rate trends
Since early 2022, mortgage rates have increased significantly due to inflation and a series of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. With inflation under control and the Fed pivoting toward rate cuts, mortgage rates have already started to drop from this year’s highs. How low rates fall will depend on how quickly the Fed lowers rates and the evolving economic outlook. Most economic projections call for average mortgage rates to move close to 6% by the end of 2024. What factors affect my mortgage rate?
A lender may advertise rates on its website, but that’s likely not the rate you’ll end up qualifying for. Your interest rate may be higher or lower depending on a variety of factors.Credit score: The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate. You may be able to qualify for a mortgage credit score under 700, but you’ll pay a premium for the loan. To get the lowest mortgage rate, you’ll want a credit score of 740 or higher. Building your credit score can take some time, but it can make homeownership much more affordable in the long run.Loan-to-value ratio: Your LTV ratio is the size of your mortgage — or if you’re refinancing, how much equity you have in your home — compared with the value of the property. The larger your down payment is, the lower your LTV will be. An LTV of 80% or less (meaning you have a down payment of at least 20%) will help you secure the best mortgage rate and allow you to avoid paying private mortgage insurance on conventional loans.Debt-to-income ratio: How much debt you have will limit the amount you can borrow and impact your mortgage interest rate. Because your mortgage is paid monthly, lenders typically look at your monthly debt payments and calculate it as a percentage of your income. This is known as your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI. The maximum allowable DTI varies by loan type and lender. A good DTI target is 36% or less, and it should include your future mortgage payment.Income: Proof of stable and consistent income is an important factor. Certain types of employment, such as self-employed or commission-based pay, could factor into a loan approval and rate offer. In the eyes of the lender, some borrowers are seen as a riskier investment and may want the borrower to pay more for that risk. Other mortgage resources
CNET Mortgage CalculatorCompare Current Mortgage RatesCompare Current Refinance Rates How to Get a Mortgage in 10 Steps Methodology
We evaluated a range of lenders based on such factors as nationwide availability, loan product variety, online convenience, customer satisfaction, and transparency regarding rates and fees. Our list doesn’t take into account factors such as mortgage rates and APRs because those depend on market conditions and your individual creditworthiness.Nationwide availability: We took into account a lender’s geographic footprint when compiling this list. We looked for lenders that operate in most, if not all, US states.Loan product variety: We evaluated a lender based on its loan product menu and the variety of products offered. Lenders who offered most or all mortgage products available stood out to us.Transparency: Mortgage lenders’ transparency regarding mortgage rates, lender fees and credit check requirements for those rates and fees was also important. We looked for lenders who made it easy for customers to access daily mortgage rates and lender fees online without requiring a credit check to do so.Online convenience: When evaluating each lender, we paid attention to the ease, or difficulty, of its mortgage application. We looked for lenders who offered a completely digital mortgage application process for ultimate convenience. In addition, we noted whether the online process was streamlined or full of hiccups for the applicant.Customer satisfaction: To measure customer satisfaction, we relied on the J.D. Power and Associates 2022 Mortgage Origination survey, which ranks lenders based on their customer satisfaction scores. We also considered a company’s Better Business Bureau rating for additional context. We looked for lenders who had above-average scores on the J.D. Power survey in addition to a solid BBB rating. FAQs
What is the easiest type of loan to get approved for?
Government-backed mortgages, such as FHA, USDA and VA loans, are generally easier to get approved for than conventional loans because they have more flexible credit score and down payment requirements. FHA loans, in particular, are a great option for first-time homebuyers with a low credit score and minimal down payment savings. Backed by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans offer 3.5% down payment options for those with credit scores of 580 or above.    VA loans are backed by the US Department of Veterans Affairs and have no down payment requirement. There is also no minimum credit score as the minimum required score varies by lender, but many lenders like to see a credit score of at least 640 or higher. To qualify for a VA loan, you must be an active or retired US military member or spouse of one.    Backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA loans are intended for low- to moderate-income homebuyers in rural areas. They offer 100% financing, meaning you don’t need to make a down payment upfront. What credit score do I need for a mortgage loan?
Most conventional loans require a credit score of 620 or higher, but FHA and other loan types may accommodate borrowers with scores as low as 500, depending on the lender.   For most conventional loans, you’ll need a credit score of 620 or higher. FHA loans and other loans accommodate borrowers with scores as low as 500. Is it better to use a mortgage lender or a bank?
Both private mortgage lenders and banks offer mortgages with rates and terms that depend on your credit score and other financial details. One isn’t objectively better than the other. Whether you go with a bank or a private lender depends on your financial situation and what type of loan you need.    Traditional banks tend to have stricter credit requirements and fewer loan options than private lenders because they’re subject to federal compliance and reporting laws. Many buyers, especially those with a strong credit history, opt to get a mortgage from their bank simply because they have an account there.    Private lenders are often a bit more flexible on borrowing requirements because they aren’t backed by a bank or credit union, meaning they don’t have to meet the same federal regulations. They set their criteria. The downside is that you lose certain protections because private lenders don’t have to follow established lending guidelines. But it’s worth exploring private lenders if you’re struggling to qualify for a conventional loan with a traditional bank. How can I get preapproved for a mortgage loan?
Getting preapproved for a mortgage is a simple process, and with some online lenders, it can take as little as 15 minutes. Preapproval is widely recommended as it shows sellers you are serious buyers. Before starting the process, experts recommend you review your credit history and report any errors to the credit bureaus for correction. Your credit history is a major factor in whether a lender preapproves you for a home loan and at what interest rate.  To get preapproved, you’ll need to hand over some financial documents, like pay stubs from the last 30 days, your W-2s and potentially tax returns from the last two years to a lender for review. For a full list of the documents you’ll need, click
here . If preapproved, you’ll receive a preapproval letter indicating your maximum home loan amount, estimated interest rate, loan type and terms.
