If you have a bank account, there’s a decent chance you have access to Zelle. More than 2,200 banks and credit unions are part of the Zelle network, which allows you to send money to others with just an email address or phone number -- no account or routing numbers required. These banks and credit unions impose different restrictions on how much you can transfer with Zelle. Read on to learn more about some of the common limits you’ll find at well-known financial institutions.  Zelle transfer limits for top banks
Bank Daily limitMonthly limitBank of America $3,500/10 transactions$20,000BMO $750$5,000Capital One $3,000Not publicly listedChase $500 – $15,000Not publicly listedCitibank $500 – $5,000 (based on account type and how long the account has been open)$2,500 – $20,000 (based on account type and how long the account has been open)Discover $600Not publicly listedFirst Citizens Bank $1,000$3,500Navy Federal Credit Union $3,000 for standard service ($1,500 for instant)$3,000Quontic $500 per transaction; $1,000 per dayNot publicly listedWells Fargo $3,500$20,000
Zelle transfer limits as of May 16, 2025.There’s also a big change for Zelle in 2025: If your bank or credit union doesn’t offer it, you’re out of luck. While Zelle used to have its own app, that’s no longer the case. The standalone app shut down in April. And even if your financial institution is part of the Zelle network, don’t be shocked if you encounter some issues sending money to someone you don’t know. Chase recently updated its policy to reserve the right to block Zelle transactions if the bank believes it may be a scam. CNET's partners offer APY's above national averages

Zelle limits for small businessesIf you run a small business, Zelle can help you pay and get paid quickly. In 2024, small businesses sent and received about $283 billion on the platform, doing everything from paying employees to covering their monthly rent.In most cases, banks offer higher send limits for small-business users but be sure to read the fine print before you start using the service. At Truist, for example, small-business customers pay a 1% transaction fee for receiving money via Zelle with a maximum fee of $15. But some of the best banks for business checking accounts are still Zelle holdouts. Axos and LendingClub, for example, don’t offer Zelle integrations.Many banks don’t list their small-business limits for Zelle, as these limits can be dynamic to allow businesses to send large sums of money. To offer an idea of the typical limit range, consider these top banks:Bank Daily limit Monthly limit Bank of America $15,000 $60,000 Chase $1,000 - $15,000 (depending on account tier) Not publicly listed Citibank $1,000 for accounts open less than 30 days or with recent changes; $5,000 for accounts open longer $4,000 for accounts open less than 30 days or with recent changes; $40,000 for accounts open longer First Citizens Bank $1,500 $5,000Zelle transfer limits as of May 16, 2025.How banks set Zelle limitsWhile it can be frustrating to make multiple transfers if you have a large amount to send, Zelle’s limits provide a layer of protection for you and your bank. Because most Zelle transactions can’t be canceled, the limits help lessen the financial loss if your account is compromised or you send money to the wrong person. Most banks and credit unions set Zelle limits based on daily, weekly and monthly dollar amounts. Some banks also impose a transaction limit. Your bank may also consider your account and your history with recipients, too. For example, if you regularly send money to a roommate for your rent, your bank may eventually increase the limit for this recipient. Chase says it uses risk factors to determine a consumer’s daily Zelle limit for each recipient, which is automatically displayed when you set a payment.How to know your Zelle transfer limitIf your bank supports Zelle payments -- and most do -- you can find your transfer limit on your bank’s website or app. Here's how:Log into your online banking platform or open your mobile banking app. You’ll typically see an option to “pay” or “pay or transfer.” Zelle should be one of your options. You can find your limits within the Zelle section. Alternatively, when you enter a recipient’s name and contact information, you should see a notification for how much you can send them in one day.You can also check out the terms page for Zelle on your bank’s website.How to manage Zelle transfer limitsThe best way to work around your Zelle transfer limits is to split your payments over multiple days. For example, if you need to send someone $7,000 and your daily limit is only $1,000, ask the recipient if you can send them $1,000 a day for seven days. Bear in mind that you may hit your monthly limit by doing this, depending on the bank. You may need to consider using other payment services if that's the case. Can you increase your Zelle transfer limit?Some banks increase your Zelle transfer limit after your transaction history shows a pattern of transfers to the same person. This kind of adjustment is typically done on an individual basis -- you won’t get a bigger limit for everyone on your contact list. However, it never hurts to ask your bank or credit union for an increase.You can also potentially increase your Zelle transfer limits by establishing yourself as a high-end customer with some banks, including Citibank and Truist. Both offer higher daily and monthly Zelle limits to people who have bigger deposit balances or take advantage of more services at the bank.Some banks don't offer any wiggle room. For example, U.S. Bank -- which doesn't publicly disclose any of its Zelle limits -- says on its website that it doesn't increase limits for customers because of safety and security reasons.Alternatives to ZelleIf Zelle’s limits are too restrictive for your money management needs, there are other payment apps you can use to send cash.Venmo: If you complete the identity verification process, Venmo’s weekly send limit can be as high as $60,000.PayPal: With a verified account, there's no limit to the total amount of money you can send on PayPal. For individual transactions, the limit varies between $10,000 and $60,000.Apple Pay: Apple Pay users can send up to $10,000 in one transaction but you can only send $10,000 in total over a seven-day period.Cash App: Unverified users can only send $1,000 in a 30-day period, but the company offers higher limits -- which aren't publicly disclosed -- after verifying your name, date of birth and Social Security number.And finally, you can use bank wire transfers, which tend to cost between $25 and $35, or ACH transfers, which are typically free and can take about three days to process. You could also write a check, which generally takes about two business days to clear. While these options may cost more time or money, they’re good for sending sizable chunks of cash.The bottom line As more banks and credit unions join the Zelle network, it’s getting easier to send money to anyone by simply entering their email address or phone number. However, how much you can send depends on where you bank. And no matter what service you’re planning to use to send cash digitally, make sure you’re steering clear of these scams.FAQsCan I send $5,000 through Zelle?
Many banks have daily sending limits below $5,000. You may be able to split up a $5,000 payment into smaller transactions on multiple days to adhere to these limits.
What are the drawbacks to sending money via Zelle?
If you need to send a large amount of money in one transaction, Zelle may not be the best fit. Some banks impose daily send limits of $1,000 or less. Additionally, you’re out of luck if you need to send money internationally. Zelle only works with bank accounts based in the US.Does Zelle charge a fee?
No, Zelle doesn’t charge a fee to send money. The company does advise people to verify that the bank or credit union they use won’t charge any of their own fees. Banks and credit unions don’t typically add fees for Zelle payments, though.Does Zelle do instant transfer?
Zelle payments can typically be processed within minutes. But the daily sending limits for instant transfers may be lower than regular transfers, depending on the bank. Also, some Zelle transactions may take longer if the recipient hasn’t enrolled in the service yet.
