Best free tax software, compared
What is free tax software and how does it work?

How do free tax software products make money?
Methodology: How we select the best free tax software
Best free tax filing options
IRS Free File
The IRS partners with eight different companies to provide its
Free File Program , which offers tax software to Americans whose
adjusted gross income , or AGI, is $84,000 or less. Among those listed are TaxAct and TaxSlayer. Both are on our list of the
best tax software for 2025 . As with most services offered for free, there are some stipulations, however. Not all state returns are free — each IRS partner specifically lists which states are included in its Free File.
Maximum AGIs
also vary by tax partner, and can be as little as $48,000, unless you are active military. So be sure to carefully read each product description to determine if you qualify. In some cases, you may be able to file your taxes for free outside of the IRS Free File Program. Some IRS Free File partners may have better in-house free filing options for you to take advantage of. But
freelancers and gig economy
workers may find IRS Free File more affordable than pricier services like TurboTax and H&R Block. If your AGI is greater than $84,000, you can still file for free with the IRS using its
Free File Fillable Forms , but they don’t include free state return options, and there’s no guided assistance. You’ll need to manually check the math, and you can’t make changes once your return is accepted.
IRS Direct File IRS Direct File
is a proprietary filing option from the IRS that launched in 2024. It’s still available to taxpayers, despite some confusion this month about whether Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency
deleted the program . The free federal filing option helped 140,000 Americans across 12 states file tax returns last year. In 2025,
25 total states will be able to file
using the service.  IRS Direct File has expanded the kinds of
deductions and tax credits
you can include in your return. This includes, health savings account distributions, the child and dependent care credit and retirement savings contribution credits. This is on top of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit available in 2024. Over time, IRS Direct File is expected to become a free federal tax filing alternative to TurboTax, H&R Block and other commercial software providers. But in our opinion, it has to expand the amount of tax situations and states it covers.  Read our full review of IRS Direct File
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance or Tax Counseling for the Elderly
The IRS also offers free tax preparation services for those most in need: The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program helps filers who make less than $67,000, those with disabilities or those who speak limited English. The volunteers are IRS-certified and supply basic income tax return prep. Tax Counseling for the Elderly assists those who are 60 and older with specific advice on retirement-related concerns. Even those who are still working but nearing retirement might benefit from TCE services. To find a VITA or TCE site near you, use the
VITA/TCE Locator Tool
or call 800-906-9887.
H&R Block Free Online See at H&R Block H&R Block’s free tier lets you easily import tax documents and includes a federal tax return and one state return. About 55% of filers qualify to file for free, according to the company. If you previously filed with TurboTax, H&R Block makes it incredibly easy to switch by importing your previous year’s tax return
directly from TurboTax . You can also import a PDF of your 2024 return.  H&R Block Free Edition includes many common tax forms, including unemployment and student  loan interest. If you begin your tax return on an H&R Block paid tier and realize you can file for free, downgrading remains a hassle,
at least for now.
You are still required to call H&R Block to request the downgrade. Your progress on your tax return will also be deleted.  Overall, H&R Block’s free version allows more IRS forms than TurboTax in 2025. The full list of IRS forms supported by Free Online can be found in this
PDF list from H&R Block . Be sure to check that your tax situation qualifies you to file for free.  Read our full review of H&R Block .
TurboTax Free Edition See at TurboTax TurboTax Free Edition is designed for taxpayers filing simple form 1040 returns only, with basic credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and student loan interest. Approximately 37% of taxpayers qualify. You must have a simple form 1040 return only and cannot file any schedules except for Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and Student Loan Interest to qualify.   Though TurboTax’s software is excellent — it’s earned the top spot on CNET’s list of
best tax software
four years in a row — TurboTax
has had its fair share of run-ins with the Federal Trade Commission
over accusations it misled taxpayers into paying for returns despite qualifying for Free Edition. I was happy to see that this year TurboTax makes it much clearer for customers, as they fill out their return, whether they have to pay to use its service. Before you get started, be sure to read the list of
tax forms supported by TurboTax Free Edition
to see if you qualify to file for free. If you have a simple return, as detailed above, you can be confident in filing your return without needing to pay for a higher tier, a tax review or handing over your taxes to a tax professional.  Read our full review of TurboTax .
FreeTaxUSA See at FreeTaxUSA In addition to being an IRS FreeFile partner, FreeTaxUSA provides a strong in-house option for filing your federal income taxes at no cost. The tax preparation software gives you one free federal return that includes all the IRS forms and schedules that most tax filers need. But you’ll need to pay $15 to file per state return. A well-organized and efficient question-and-answer model will guide you through the entire tax filing process. FreeTaxUSA just doesn’t have the polished interface and support features of
top tax software
like
TurboTax
or
H&R Block , but it does a good job of providing contextual help to answer common tax questions. Read our full review of FreeTaxUSA .
Cash App Taxes See at Cash App Taxes You can file your taxes for free with Cash App Taxes, no matter how complicated your situation is. The catch? You have to download the company’s mobile app to get started, even if you end up filing on your laptop or desktop. I like that Cash App offers a completely free way to file — no matter your tax situation — but it’s best for confident filers. Cash App doesn’t offer as much hand-holding through the filing process as competitors do. But if you don’t need much help or have a relatively simple tax situation and don’t qualify for free filing with TurboTax or H&R Block, it’s a great option. Read our full review of Cash App Taxes .
TaxSlayer See at TaxSlayer You’ll need a simple return to qualify for free tax filing with TaxSlayer. Its Simply Free tier lets you prepare, file and print your federal return — and get one free state return. TaxSlayer Simply Free also has email and phone support should you need extra help, which is a plus.  Unfortunately, TaxSlayer Simply Free has some pretty strict limitations. Unlike with most commercial tax service providers, you can’t
claim the Child Tax Credit
or
Earned Income Tax Credit
with its free tier. If you made over $100,000 in income of any form last year (job or unemployment), you also won’t qualify.  Check out the
full list of requirements for TaxSlayer Simply Free . Read our full review of TaxSlayer .
TaxAct See at TaxAct With
TaxAct Free , critical tax forms, like those for the Earned Income Tax Credit and
Child Tax Credit , are included. Unemployment income and dependents are also covered. After you file a federal return, your details are used to autofill your state return and, as with H&R Block and TurboTax, you’ll be able to see your estimated refund in real time. However, TaxAct doesn’t include a free state tax return; that’ll cost you $54. Read the list of
state and federal forms TaxAct offers for free
(click on “forms”) before deciding if TaxAct Free will work for your situation. Read our full review of TaxAct . Best free tax software, compared

What is free tax software and how does it work?
Free tax preparation software allows you to complete all the necessary forms for your tax return and file them with the IRS. Simple, guided, interview-style questions let users answer tax questions that populate electronic IRS forms.These free tax programs include options to receive your tax refund by direct deposit, prepaid debit cards or as a check in the mail.Users should be wary of upselling measures taken by commercial tax service providers to use paid tiers or add-on services. Some software publishers earn money by enticing free filers to upgrade for extra support or additional IRS forms that aren’t included with free versions. If the software you’re using requires an upgrade for a form or service you need, another service may include the forms you need for free. How to file your taxes for free
The best free tax software for you will depend on your filing situation. It's best to gather all of your tax forms, such as W-2s and 1099s, and check if they are covered in a company's free tier. You should do the same with deductions and credits you plan to claim. You may not qualify to file for free with all services, but chances are that you can with at least one of the options on our best list. Keep in mind that some free tiers, like TaxSlayer's, will disqualify tax filers from free filing based on income.
We're fans of H&R Block's free tax filing software, because it's extended to more filers than most services and offers helpful support features. However, it doesn't cover all filing situations. IRS programs like FreeFile and Direct File are good options that could help you file your taxes for free, but they have their own drawbacks, such as not covering state tax returns and limiting the credits you can claim. DirectFile is also available in only 25 states.Cash App Taxes covers all filing situations for free but doesn’t have great help and support. And the filing experience is especially difficult if you have a complicated return. FreeTaxUSA, meanwhile, is only free if you don’t have to file a state return. If you qualify, TurboTax's free filing tier is also worth looking into, and offers the best filing experience of platforms we've tested. How do free tax software products make money?
Filing your taxes for free may seem too good to be true. But tax software companies have other ways of making money when you file with them. Companies that offer free tax software generally earn money in two ways:They attract free filers and then upsell them with paid service or feature upgrades.They earn indirect income from free filers by collecting data, targeting users with advertisements, raising brand awareness or cross-selling financial products and services, thereby increasing the number of users for their products.For example, Cash App Taxes requires that users install its Cash App mobile payment app. Increasing the users of the Cash App service helps the company earn money in ways like retailer hardware fees, transaction fees, selling bitcoin and net interest lending. Methodology: How we select the best free tax software
CNET reviews tax software by comparing products across set criteria. We use the software to prepare personal tax returns, examine tax products’ terms and offers, communicate with software representatives to resolve questions about products, compare feature sets and analyze each software for its effectiveness in common tax situations.We consider the features and functionality of the tax preparation software, the user experience, the software interface, website performance, quality of help and support, and the value based on price. We are also looking for and evaluating specific features, including file importing or photo capture of forms, number and type of available IRS forms and schedules, contextual help, professional tax assistance, maximum refund and accuracy guarantees, live support and security protections.Specifically for best free tax software, we consider the limitations and restrictions of the free services offered, unique features for each service, functionality related to low-income tax filers, in-person support and assistance, and whether a free state tax return is included with the free federal return.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.
