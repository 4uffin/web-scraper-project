Reviews ethics statement
Joseph Kaminski Senior Associate Technology Editor / Reviews During my almost twenty years at CNET, I handled benchmark testing/methodologies for both Mac and PC systems and, sometime after, integrated testing for micro-mobility (e-bikes, electric scooters and EUCs), which is a passion of mine. Transitioning from a BMX background to this field was seamless.
Despite testing numerous products, each new one brings the same excitement as my first.

Electric bike FAQ
Bikes have always been a great mode of transportation. Now, with the integration of the electric bike, you get added speed and convenience. The number of e-bikes in bike shops is rising as their popularity increases. They're a great option for commuting and come in a wide variety of styles.To help you find the best option, CNET tested commuter e-bikes from Rad Power, Aventon, Lectric, Fiido and Ride1Up. We focused on real-world scenarios like commuting through cities, with some models tested for suburban and light off-road use. We evaluated each bike’s handling, motor performance, range, safety features and overall value to bring you the top choices.What is the best e-bike overall?CNET's editors have crowned the Aventon Soltera 2 as the best overall e-bike. The Soltera 2 offers an affordable price, a lightweight (41 pounds) bike frame and a seven-speed cassette, alongside iOS/Android app compatibility and a throttle for assistance on hills. But there are plenty of other good options for those specifically after a folding e-bike, one that can carry heavy cargo or something for kids and teens rather than full-grown commuters, and you'll find the full suite of our favorite electric commuter bikes below.Best Electric Bikes for 2025

Best e-bike overall

$999 at Aventon
The entire Aventon lineup offers affordability and versatility. The $1,799 Abound is a cargo bike suitable for carrying passengers or groceries, while the $1,699 Aventure 2 is a multifaceted fat-tire bike ideal for all-terrain riding in any season. The Soltera 2 is more of an everyday e-bike that's great for commutes, with a seven-speed cassette and a weight of just 41 pounds. Like the other Aventon bikes, the Soltera 2 features a sleek, detailed display, integrated signal lights, iOS/Android app compatibility and a throttle for assistance on hills.

Engwe L20 2.0
Best budget step through electric bike
Photo Gallery 1/1
$749 at Engwe
The Engwe L20 2.0 is the updated version of the L20 James Bricknell previously reviewed and loved. The update has changed some things that have improved it, like the ability to fold the bike away and a more powerful 1000W motor to make acceleration smoother. The downside of having the fold in the center is the weight limit is reduced so he wouldn't recommend riding with a baby seat like he used to on the 1.0 version. Aside from that the L20 2.0 is a great fat tire bike that his wife uses every day to ride around the neighborhood.

Lectric XP 3.0
Best for heavy cargo
Photo Gallery 1/1
$999 at Lectric
The Lectric XP 3.0 fat-tire folding bike is great for its portability, foldability and impressive capabilities. It's robust and versatile, with a total payload capacity of 330 pounds, including a rear rack that supports up to 150 pounds. Furthermore, it offers a range of useful accessories and a key ignition, making it less attractive to thieves. The XP 3.0 also comes in a step-thru version for getting on and off of it easily. The XP was also tested in South Carolina and proved to handle well due to its 20-by-3-inch tires and front suspension fork. In addition to being foldable and durable, the XP 3.0 can hit a top speed of 28 mph, powered by a 500-watt motor.

Gotrax V14 Electric Balance Bike
Best electric balance bike for kids
Photo Gallery 1/1
$380 at Gotrax
James Bricknell's 6-year-old and testing partner really enjoyed her time with the Gotrax V14 balance bike. It's helped her learn how to balance correctly and she can zip around at an average speed of about 11mph. Every day they ride down to get her bus to school as well as ride to the local parks. The Gotrax is incredibly sturdy and easy to use with excellent braking and a simple electric on/off that his daughter picked up immediately. He would have liked it if the bike had two speed settings, low and full, so the kids can handle the acceleration better when they are starting out, but he would still recommend this for anyone who wants to use their electric bike with their child riding beside them.

Tenways CGO600 Pro
Best for a traditional bicycle experience
Photo Gallery 1/1
$1,499 at Tenways
For folks who need pedal-assist without the bulkiness commonly associated with e-bikes, the Tenways CGO600 Pro is an ideal choice. It offers a smooth ride, with assistance on or off, and weighs about the same as a standard bicycle, at 37 pounds. The Tenways CGO600 Pro utilizes a carbon belt drive and hydraulic disc brakes, requiring minimal upkeep. Its design is so discreet that it's nearly impossible to tell it's an e-bike from a distance. The bike’s display is minimalistic, and the vehicle can be powered on via a user-set passcode.

$3,799 at Woom
The perfect bike for riding with young ones, so no more travel fatigue. The Woom Up e-bike, sized for either children or teens, features a premium design and three pedal-assist levels up to 12 mph. The bike includes a user-friendly app with straightforward assembly and provides a smooth, comfortable ride. Despite the initial cost, its build quality and components are exceptional, and this bike should hold some resale value by the time your little one outgrows it.

$799 at Fiido
The Fiido X is a compact folding e-bike perfect for shorter commutes and for small storage spaces like an average apartment. Its sleek design makes it one of the most attractive folding bikes available. You could easily store it in a car trunk, a closet or the corner of a bedroom. Whether it was part of my daily commute or on some trails in South Carolina, this bike held its own.

Async A1 Pro
Best for full-time throttle use (Update: Discontinued)

See at Async
Boasting a futuristic design, the Async A1 Pro looks as fun as it is to ride. Its cutting-edge features include a 5.5-inch display and Bluetooth connectivity with LTE, which means users can track the bike using a Find My Bike feature. Its off-road mode enables up to 35 mph speeds, providing an exciting riding experience. Though you can use pedal-assist to extend battery, this isn't a bike you buy for exercise but for full-speed thrills, as it challenges the distinction between e-bike and motorbike.

Electric bike FAQ
How fast can an electric bike go?
Before we can go into top speeds, we first need to go over e-bike classifications. There are three classes.Class 1 is an e-bike where the motor only supplies pedal assistance while the rider is pedaling and has a max assisted speed of 20 mph.Class 2 follows the same pedal-assist top speed as class 1 but also has a throttle enabling the rider to get around without pedaling.Class 3 has a top assist speed of 28 mph and can be either pedal-assist only or pedal-assist along with throttle-assistance.These classes are limited to 1 horsepower (750 watts). That said, some (air quotes) e-bikes can hit 50 to 60 mph. But they are more like motorcycles with pedals. They are not optimized as traditional bicycles for pedaling from point A to B and do not legally fit into the class 1-3 category. Typically only class 1 and 2 e-bikes are allowed where traditional bicycles are.
Show more
Do I need a permit or license to operate an e-bike?
The short answer is no. But riders must meet the minimum age limit (which can vary) in their state. In New York, that is 16.
Show more
Should I buy an electric bike or an electric scooter?
It's frankly pretty fun to have one of each. But if you need a reason to pick one over the other, an e-bike can also be used as a traditional bike so riders benefit from getting a workout along with the fact you can travel further, even on a dead battery. In addition, most people I talk to feel better on bicycles because they've had more experience riding them.
Show more
Can you ride an electric bike without pedaling?
Some electric bikes might offer a throttle as an alternative to pedaling. However, most require users to pedal in order to engage the battery and motor and offer assistance.
Show more
Do electric bikes charge as you pedal?
Most electric bikes do not include pedal charging as a feature and require you to plug them in to charge.
