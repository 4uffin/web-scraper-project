OUR WINNERS
Apple iPhone 16
Apple’s cumulative camera and performance upgrades come together impressively in the iPhone 16, making it the ultimate general-purpose phone.  iPhone owners upgrading from a phone that’s a couple of generations old that want a better camera. The iPhone 16’s most notable new addition -- Apple Intelligence -- isn’t here yet. But if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 or earlier, you’ll notice a big leap in camera quality, plus you’ll get other handy features that Apple has added in recent years, like the Dynamic Island and the Action button. The iPhone 16 may not have one big standout feature, but the way all of these gradual improvements come together make it a strong choice for iPhone fans that want something faster with a better camera without splurging on the Pro.–   Lisa Eadicicco, senior editor Learn more
Samsung Galaxy S24
What impresses me the most about the Samsung Galaxy S24 isn't the new Galaxy AI features, brighter screens or solid cameras. It's the battery life. If you're on a Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus (or older) and are inclined to upgrade, the Galaxy S24 will seem like a major improvement in nearly every way. The challenge for the larger, more expensive S24 Plus is that Google's Pixel 9 Pro has the same price and better cameras. The Galaxy S24 is a wonderful, well-built phone that is excellent right out of the box just as the nearly identical S22 and S23 were before it. This similarity to the S22 and S23 can be viewed as either a strength, because the design reflects three years of refinements, or a weakness, because features like the camera hardware are essentially identical to what came out in 2022. But all of this is overshadowed by the great battery life.–   Patrick Holland, managing editor Learn more
Apple iPhone 16 Pro
The iPhone 16 Pro's ability to record high-resolution slow-motion video is the best new iPhone feature I've seen in years. OK, I'm a camera nerd. For better or worse, the new slow-mo feature overshadows Apple Intelligence. If you have an iPhone 12 Pro or older, upgrading to the 16 Pro makes a lot of sense. If you're on a 13 Pro and still have a decent battery capacity, I'd say save your money. And if you're on a 14 Pro or 15 Pro, there's no need to upgrade. The iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max have everything we've come to expect in a year-over-year upgrade. Even without Apple Intelligence at launch, the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max have a slew of upgrades including a good battery life, larger displays, outstanding photo and video chops, high-resolution slo-mo, a new Camera Control button and a bunch of iOS 18 goodies. The negatives are as thin as the borders around the new screens: You only get 128GB of storage for a $1,000, the color options are drab and the new camera button that feels like it was designed to be something else entirely.–   Patrick Holland Learn more
Google Pixel 8A
The Pixel 8A’s compact design, impressive camera for the price and Pixel software features make it a top choice for Android fans on a budget.  Android users who prefer smaller phones and want a great camera without spending close to $1,000. The Pixel 8A impressed us so much, it was hard to find something bad to say about it. While you won’t get the Pixel 9’s new camera features like Add Me and macro mode, you will get a very capable camera packed in a sleek design that will get new versions of Android for years to come. Google also has a tendency to roll out Pixel-specific software updates over time, so we can likely expect the Pixel 8A to gain even more functionality as time goes on.–   Lisa Eadicicco Learn more
Motorola Razr Plus (2024)
From the bold colors and vegan leather back to the cover screen software and widgets, I genuinely can't remember the last time I used a phone as fun as the Motorola Razr Plus. The Razr Plus is an absolute delight to use and will no doubt appeal to people looking for something more unique and fashionable than the standard rectangular phone slabs offered by Apple and Samsung. The 4-inch cover screen makes the Razr Plus feel like two phones in one. You can use pretty much any app on the outer display as well as respond to messages, watch videos, make video calls and even play games -- all without opening the Razr Plus up.Add to that a long battery life, fast charging, improved cameras and an IPX8 rating that certifies that the Razr Plus will survive temporary dunking and you realize just how much value Motorola has poured into its flagship foldable. Its $1,000 price is steep, but you're getting one of the best clamshell style foldables you can buy.–   Patrick Holland Learn more
Xiaomi 14 Ultra
Its camera's image sensor is much bigger than those found on other phones, allowing it to take stunning images in both daylight and at night. Enthusiast photographers, especially anyone into fast-paced street photography and black and white imagery. The 14 Ultra is a powerhouse Android phone but it's really the camera performance that sets it apart. I particularly love using the phone's Pro mode, shooting moody street images using the built-in Leica monochrome mode. At night, its unusual variable aperture allows for sunstar effects on points of light that I've never seen possible on a phone before.–   Andrew Lanxon, principal writer Learn more
Apple Watch Series 10
This is the slimmest Apple Watch yet and has a ticking second hand on some watch faces, which makes it look and feel more like a traditional wrist watch. The Apple Watch Series 10 is best for iPhone owners who want a comprehensive range of health and fitness tracking features, like sleep apnea notifications. Anyone upgrading from a Series 6 or earlier will appreciate the bigger, brighter screen and lighter feel on the wrist. The Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch's tenth birthday. The wide-angle OLED screen makes it brighter when looking at it off-axis and the LTPO3 technology adds a ticking second hand to the always-on display. Battery life is still rated for 18 hours, though you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use and it charges faster than earlier Apple Watches. Overall, it's an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners.–   Lexy Savvides, principal video producer Learn more
Google Pixel Watch 3
The Pixel Watch is the best-looking Android smartwatch period, and it gets even better in its third generation. Android phone owners and Fitbit fans who want a general purpose, stylish smartwatch for tracking workouts and receiving phone notifications on your wrist.   The Pixel Watch was already my favorite Android smartwatch. But the third generation gains new tools for building custom runs, two size options, a larger screen and a bunch of other improvements that help address shortcomings from the previous models. Plus, Google no longer requires a Fitbit Premium subscription for one of its best features, the daily readiness score, making it an even more compelling fitness tracker.–   Lisa Eadicicco Learn more
Apple AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation
With improved sound quality and a slightly more compact design, the AirPods 4 ANC are the first open buds to have active noise canceling that actually works.  People who want earbuds with an open design or just don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. The AirPods 4 ANC are equipped with Apple’s H2 chip, the same chip that powers Apple’s AirPods Pro 2. Also, Apple has upgraded the buds with a new acoustic architecture and amp along with a charging case that’s a little more compact than the AirPods 3’s case case. – David Carnoy, executive editor  Learn more
Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 3
Some users were critical of Samsung for changing the design of its earbuds, adding stems and making them more like the AirPods Pro 2. But they’re all-around impressive earbuds that feature a comfortable fit, excellent sound, decent noise canceling, built-in voice controls and top-notch voice-calling performance.  Samsung Galaxy device users and Android users. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro feature dual drivers -- a 10mm dynamic driver paired with a Planar tweeter that enhances treble performance. They also have dual amps, which helps reduce wireless hiccups.– David Carnoy Learn more
Shokz OpenRun Pro 2
Shokz has finally cracked the code on bone-conduction sound quality with a novel dual-driver design in its new flagship OpenRun Pro 2 headphones. Runners and bikers looking for neckband-style wireless earbuds that fit securely and have an open design for safety reasons. The OpenRun Pro 2 also work well for making voice calls, with good background noise reduction, including wind noise.– David Carnoy Learn more
Earfun Air Pro 4
Once again Earfun has delivered a set of well-designed earbuds that deliver strong sound, a robust feature set and solid good noise canceling for their modest price. Apple or Android smartphone users looking for quality noise-canceling true-wireless earbuds that don’t cost too much.  The Earfun Air Pro 4 earbuds have better battery life than their predecessor -- up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on. They’re also good for making calls.– David Carnoy Learn more
Soundcore by Anker Boom 2
You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better sounding portable Bluetooth speaker for the money. I also liked the size and design of the speaker -- it’s neither too big nor too small and has some built-in LED lights to help create that party vibe. Last, but not least, it’s fully waterproof and floats.   Anybody looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker that’s relatively compact and delivers impressive sound for its size.  The speaker's battery life is rated at an impressive 24 hours at moderate volume levels (it charges via USB-C) and you can tweak the sound and customize the lighting with the Soundcore app for iOS and Android. There's also a USB-out port to charge your devices.– David Carnoy Learn more
Microsoft Surface Laptop 7
With the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7, we finally get a true Windows rival to Apple's MacBook Air. It has the build quality and design that puts it on equal footing with the Air, and it not only closes the battery-life gap that the Air had enjoyed over its Windows competition but actually surpasses it. The Surface Laptop 7 is a well-built ultraportable with unbeatable battery life and is one of the best Windows laptops we’ve seen this year. The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is a great choice for anyone looking for a Windows laptop that offers a similarly sleek design and solid build as a MacBook along with an even better battery life. Based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, this Copilot Plus PC offers strong overall performance and can run for nearly 20 hours on a single charge. The luxuriously long battery life is the best aspect of the Surface Laptop 7, but my favorite physical feature is the haptic touchpad. For an input device that you interact with hundreds, if not thousands, of times a day, the quality of a laptop’s touchpad is often overlooked. The Surface Laptop 7’s haptic touchpad offers a lively and customizable click response that’s far superior to the feel you get from a basic mechanical touchpad.-- Matt Elliott, senior editor Learn more
Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024)
While we’ve always liked the MacBook Air for its portability and battery life, the addition of Apple’s M-series chips really took the Air to the next level. It is a laptop that meets the needs of most people. And now that it comes in 13- and 15-inch sizes, you don’t have to move up to a pricier MacBook Pro just to get a larger display.  The M3 Air is a great pick for those who need a highly portable laptop for home, work or school that is not limited to the basics. It's an even better choice if you’re an iPhone or iPad user.  The performance and battery life are great, but the fact that you get those in a slim, fanless body is why the M3 Air is our go-to recommendation for many people.– Josh Goldman, managing editor Learn more
Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2024)
The flashy slash programmable-LED on the cover plus solid performance make it an excellent well-rounded laptop for gaming, creating and everyday-ing -- without sacrificing style. Thanks to smart design and tradeoffs for its 14-inch size plus an excellent OLED screen, the ROG Zephyrus G14 is a content creation crowd pleaser that has plenty left over for good gaming. The laptop has a surprisingly full set of ports for its size, with sufficient space between them that you shouldn't have any issues with larger-than-normal connectors. Asus also includes factory-calibration display profiles for sRGB, D65 P3 and DCI-P3, but not Adobe RGB. You can probably get away with a cheaper model (than the one we tested), with an RTX 4060 and 16GB RAM, if you play games at 1080p or lightweight ones at 1440p.– Lori Grunin, senior editor Learn more
Lenovo Yoga 7 14 Gen 9
It’s a great overall package for the price. In addition to the sturdy build quality, the keyboard is comfortable and quiet and the port selection is varied and useful. Based on an AMD Ryzen 8000-series processor, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 also delivers good performance for the price and lengthy battery life. It’s the two-in-one I recommend for most people for the value and versatility it provides. With a great design, strong overall performance and outstanding battery life, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 is a well-rounded two-in-one laptop. It can regularly be found for less than $1,000 where it provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use and students.  Getting a solid, all-metal chassis at this price is our favorite part of the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9. Many sub-$1,000 models feature flimsy plastic designs, but this Yoga 7 14 boasts rigid, aluminum surfaces along with a firm display hinge that make it a pleasure to use in both laptop and tablet modes.– Matt Elliott Learn more
Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11
Some tablets are good for entertainment, others for productivity and still others are good for creative pursuits. The 11-inch Duet somehow ably does all three for around $350 (and that price includes a keyboard cover). Plus, it lasted for 11 hours on our battery tests.  Anyone who wants a small secondary device for work and entertainment from anywhere. It’s also good for people who just need a simple computer for typical daily online tasks like shopping or chatting with friends and family.  Lenovo packs in a lot of functionality at a reasonable price. Even if you get it maxed out on specs and bundled with its keyboard cover and pen, it’s still under $400. –   Josh Goldman Learn more
Apple iPad (10th generation, 10.2-inch)
The least expensive iPad is often the best iPad for most people, especially since so many iPads are for kids. This one’s getting old and may be upgraded next year, but it’s still the most affordable way to do iPad things, and its upgraded design, better-positioned front-facing camera for video chats and Apple keyboard case accessories make it feel a lot newer than older iPads before this. Kids, families and anyone else who simply wants a basic, functional tablet to do things online, watch videos, play games and casually connect. Apple’s step-up iPad models have faster processors, support for newer, more fully featured Apple Pencil Pro styluses and, in the case of the Pros, better displays, but if that doesn’t matter to you, this is the iPad that will still do you just fine. This was the first iPad to get a shifted front camera placement. It’s on the long landscape edge, instead of the shorter portrait edge. In short, it means that video chats when a keyboard is attached, or when standing the iPad up on a table in landscape mode, look centered and like a laptop. Actually, better than most laptops, since Apple’s iPad cameras tend to be upgrades compared with what Macs offer.– Scott Stein, editor at large Learn more
Razer Wolverine V3 Pro
Razer’s fine-tuning of its Wolverine controller for Xbox and PC puts it in another league. Borrowing features from the PlayStation version, the V3 Pro has everything from two extra claw grip bumper buttons and four back paddles -- all remappable -- to Hall Effect thumbsticks and high-speed ultralow-latency wireless. True to its name, the features and $200 price are aimed at serious gamers who want a competition-level wireless controller or who simply like to have the best of the best for gaming. If you can do without the wireless, Razer also has a wired Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition that has all the core features of the V3 Pro, but for $100 less. The sheer amount of controls the Wolverine V3 Pro has without feeling too cluttered or like you’re constantly hitting the wrong buttons. Plus, they can all be tweaked to your liking with Razer’s straightforward app.– Josh Goldman Learn more
Meta Quest 3S
There may not be a $300 device this year that offers more fun and upside than Meta’s mixed reality capable VR headset. The replacement to our longtime Editors' Choice Quest 2 is a budget version of Meta’s slightly fancier Quest 3 that came out last year. The 3S is $200 less expensive and has the same upgraded graphics and processing chips as the 3, plus much better color cameras that show the world around you more clearly than the Quest 2 did. The Quest 3 is still our favorite VR headset thanks to its better, clearer lenses and higher resolution display, but the Quest 3S is a perfect choice for anyone who’s curious about VR or doesn’t want to spend a lot to try VR games, connect to a PC for VR experiences, or try fitness games and apps that add mixed reality (where the camera view of the world is mixed with VR graphics to make it feel like your worlds are mixing). It’s a great fitness device if you’re okay with wearing a headset during workouts: several great apps already work surprisingly well for cardio exercise. The price for the performance and functions of this headset is sort of astounding, and right now Meta’s including a free game (Batman: Arkham Shadow) as well. Also, the improved color cameras really make being in VR and still being aware of the world around you feel possible.– Scott Stein Learn more
Samsung S95D OLED TV
OLED TVs have the best picture quality, and Samsung's best OLED TV for 2024 is the S95D. Unlike competitors, it has a matte screen to reduce reflections in bright rooms. The Samsung S95D is best for viewers who want the superior image quality of OLED and are willing to pay extra for a picture that doesn't reflect brighter objects in the room, such as windows, lamps or other light sources, as brightly. The Samsung S95D's image quality is superb in both dark home theater situations and bright rooms. It has the brightest image we've tested on any OLED TV, exceedingly accurate color and all of the gaming features we expect at a TV of this level. It's available in only three screen sizes (55-, 65- and 77-inch) so if you want another size OLED TV, this isn't for you. Its design is also unusual, with a separate external box for HDMI and other connections to allow the TV itself to be extremely thin.–   David Katzmaier, senior director of content Learn more
LG C4 OLED TV
The C4 delivers the superior image quality of OLED at a price that isn't incredibly expensive, and it's also available in a wide range of sizes from 42 to 83 inches. The C4 is best for people who want OLED's image quality benefits, including excellent contrast and off-angle viewing, without having to pay through the nose. TVs that have OLED screens routinely beat any other kind of television, including LCD and mini-LED TVs, in our side-by-side tests. The LG C4 didn't perform quite as well as the Samsung S95D in our comparison, but this LG costs hundreds less so we wouldn't blame you for choosing it instead. Of course the C4 has spectacular picture quality in its own right, anchored by the perfect black levels of OLED, and includes all of the important features and extras available on other high-end TVs.–   David Katzmaier Learn more
Roku Express 4K Plus
The Roku Express 4K Plus does all of the 4K streaming you want for the lowest possible price. If you have a smart TV that is getting older, and some of the apps don’t work any more, then the Express 4K will upgrade it instantly. The Roku Express is great as it is, but it can be upgraded too. Add wired internet with an external USB Ethernet hub adapter, or get the improved Voice Remote Pro with backlit keys.–   Ty Pendlebury, editor Learn more
Audio Technica AT-70x
The Audio-Technica AT-70x is easy to setup and use, plus it sounds great. It’s the best budget record player you can buy. This record player is well suited to beginners due to its simple operation, but it will also appeal to people who want a set-and-forget turntable. The AT-70x boasts automatic operation meaning you can press a button and music plays -- no fiddling around with the tonearm or removing the platter to change speeds.–   Ty Pendlebury Learn more
Nuvvyo Tablo 4th Gen
The “new Tablo” is affordable at $100, easy to set up and doesn’t require an ongoing subscription fee. The app is available for most phones and TVs and enables you to watch live TV anywhere in the house you want (and outside the home has also been promised).  If you’re a cord cutter who doesn’t want to pay for a live TV streaming service, the Tablo offers plenty of live content for free. It’s a great companion to FAST TV and Netflix. The Tablo includes 128GB of storage onboard -- which is enough for 50 hours of HD content -- so it’s ready to go out of the box. However it also enables you to add a USB hard drive as well (up to 8TB).–   Ty Pendlebury Learn more
Vizio 2.1 Soundbar SV210M
The Vizio 2.1 soundbar offers dynamic movie sound with clear dialogue in a very compact form-factor. The Vizio 2.1 Soundbar SV210M is great for people looking to upgrade their TV’s sound but don’t want to pay very much. It includes HDMI connectivity so it’s easy to hook up to your TV, and it has Bluetooth for music streaming. The system boasts a great-sounding wireless subwoofer but it’s so small that you can basically put it anywhere you want.–   Ty Pendlebury Learn more
BenQ X500i
With a 4K resolution, high brightness and built-in Android TV, the X500i is ready to go out of the box. It has one of the best contrast ratios we’ve ever seen, which helps boost its excellent picture quality.  The BenQ X500i is a short-throw projector, which means it can cast a large image from 5 feet away. It’s great for people who can’t pipe cables across the floor or who don’t want to pay through the nose for an ultra-short-throw design. While TVs gave up on the technology years ago, the BenQ is still capable of showing 3D movies with a pair of compatible glasses. It also plays regular 2D movies really well!–   Ty Pendlebury Learn more

Why we love itApple’s cumulative camera and performance upgrades come together impressively in the iPhone 16, making it the ultimate general-purpose phone. Who is it best for?iPhone owners upgrading from a phone that’s a couple of generations old that want a better camera.What else to knowThe iPhone 16’s most notable new addition -- Apple Intelligence -- isn’t here yet. But if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 13 or earlier, you’ll notice a big leap in camera quality, plus you’ll get other handy features that Apple has added in recent years, like the Dynamic Island and the Action button. The iPhone 16 may not have one big standout feature, but the way all of these gradual improvements come together make it a strong choice for iPhone fans that want something faster with a better camera without splurging on the Pro.–   Lisa Eadicicco, senior editor Read our full review.
Samsung Galaxy S24
Editors' choice
James Martin/CNET

Why we love itWhat impresses me the most about the Samsung Galaxy S24 isn't the new Galaxy AI features, brighter screens or solid cameras. It's the battery life.Who is it best for?If you're on a Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus (or older) and are inclined to upgrade, the Galaxy S24 will seem like a major improvement in nearly every way. The challenge for the larger, more expensive S24 Plus is that Google's Pixel 9 Pro has the same price and better cameras.What else to knowThe Galaxy S24 is a wonderful, well-built phone that is excellent right out of the box just as the nearly identical S22 and S23 were before it. This similarity to the S22 and S23 can be viewed as either a strength, because the design reflects three years of refinements, or a weakness, because features like the camera hardware are essentially identical to what came out in 2022. But all of this is overshadowed by the great battery life.–   Patrick Holland, managing editor Read our full review.

Why we love itThe Pixel 8A’s compact design, impressive camera for the price and Pixel software features make it a top choice for Android fans on a budget. Who is it best for?Android users who prefer smaller phones and want a great camera without spending close to $1,000.What else to knowThe Pixel 8A impressed us so much, it was hard to find something bad to say about it. While you won’t get the Pixel 9’s new camera features like Add Me and macro mode, you will get a very capable camera packed in a sleek design that will get new versions of Android for years to come. Google also has a tendency to roll out Pixel-specific software updates over time, so we can likely expect the Pixel 8A to gain even more functionality as time goes on.–   Lisa Eadicicco Read our full review.
Motorola Razr Plus (2024)
Editors' choice
James Martin/CNET

Why we love itFrom the bold colors and vegan leather back to the cover screen software and widgets, I genuinely can't remember the last time I used a phone as fun as the Motorola Razr Plus.Who is it best for?The Razr Plus is an absolute delight to use and will no doubt appeal to people looking for something more unique and fashionable than the standard rectangular phone slabs offered by Apple and Samsung.What else to knowThe 4-inch cover screen makes the Razr Plus feel like two phones in one. You can use pretty much any app on the outer display as well as respond to messages, watch videos, make video calls and even play games -- all without opening the Razr Plus up.Add to that a long battery life, fast charging, improved cameras and an IPX8 rating that certifies that the Razr Plus will survive temporary dunking and you realize just how much value Motorola has poured into its flagship foldable. Its $1,000 price is steep, but you're getting one of the best clamshell style foldables you can buy.–   Patrick Holland Read our full review.
Xiaomi 14 Ultra
Editors' choice
Andrew Lanxon/CNET
Why we love itIts camera's image sensor is much bigger than those found on other phones, allowing it to take stunning images in both daylight and at night.Who is it best for?Enthusiast photographers, especially anyone into fast-paced street photography and black and white imagery.What else to knowThe 14 Ultra is a powerhouse Android phone but it's really the camera performance that sets it apart. I particularly love using the phone's Pro mode, shooting moody street images using the built-in Leica monochrome mode. At night, its unusual variable aperture allows for sunstar effects on points of light that I've never seen possible on a phone before.–   Andrew Lanxon, principal writer Read our full review.

Why we love itThis is the slimmest Apple Watch yet and has a ticking second hand on some watch faces, which makes it look and feel more like a traditional wrist watch.Who is it best for?The Apple Watch Series 10 is best for iPhone owners who want a comprehensive range of health and fitness tracking features, like sleep apnea notifications. Anyone upgrading from a Series 6 or earlier will appreciate the bigger, brighter screen and lighter feel on the wrist.What else to knowThe Apple Watch Series 10 takes a winning formula and updates it for the Apple Watch's tenth birthday. The wide-angle OLED screen makes it brighter when looking at it off-axis and the LTPO3 technology adds a ticking second hand to the always-on display. Battery life is still rated for 18 hours, though you can push it to a day and a half with lighter use and it charges faster than earlier Apple Watches. Overall, it's an incredibly polished smartwatch and the best choice for most iPhone owners.–   Lexy Savvides, principal video producer Read our full review.

Why we love itThe Pixel Watch is the best-looking Android smartwatch period, and it gets even better in its third generation.Who is it best for?Android phone owners and Fitbit fans who want a general purpose, stylish smartwatch for tracking workouts and receiving phone notifications on your wrist.  What else to knowThe Pixel Watch was already my favorite Android smartwatch. But the third generation gains new tools for building custom runs, two size options, a larger screen and a bunch of other improvements that help address shortcomings from the previous models. Plus, Google no longer requires a Fitbit Premium subscription for one of its best features, the daily readiness score, making it an even more compelling fitness tracker.–   Lisa Eadicicco Read our full review.

Why we love itWith improved sound quality and a slightly more compact design, the AirPods 4 ANC are the first open buds to have active noise canceling that actually works. Who is it best for?People who want earbuds with an open design or just don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears.What else to knowThe AirPods 4 ANC are equipped with Apple’s H2 chip, the same chip that powers Apple’s AirPods Pro 2. Also, Apple has upgraded the buds with a new acoustic architecture and amp along with a charging case that’s a little more compact than the AirPods 3’s case case. – David Carnoy, executive editor  Read our full review.

Why we love itSome users were critical of Samsung for changing the design of its earbuds, adding stems and making them more like the AirPods Pro 2. But they’re all-around impressive earbuds that feature a comfortable fit, excellent sound, decent noise canceling, built-in voice controls and top-notch voice-calling performance. Who is it best for?Samsung Galaxy device users and Android users.What else to knowThe Galaxy Buds 3 Pro feature dual drivers -- a 10mm dynamic driver paired with a Planar tweeter that enhances treble performance.

Why we love itYou’ll be hard-pressed to find a better sounding portable Bluetooth speaker for the money. I also liked the size and design of the speaker -- it’s neither too big nor too small and has some built-in LED lights to help create that party vibe. Last, but not least, it’s fully waterproof and floats.  Who is it best for?Anybody looking for an affordable Bluetooth speaker that’s relatively compact and delivers impressive sound for its size. What else to knowThe speaker's battery life is rated at an impressive 24 hours at moderate volume levels (it charges via USB-C) and you can tweak the sound and customize the lighting with the Soundcore app for iOS and Android. There's also a USB-out port to charge your devices.– David Carnoy Read our full review.
The best laptop, tablet and gaming giftsSo many cool toys. Like phones, laptops are roughly divided between Apple and OTHER (a.k.a. Windows and Chromebook), so CNET's editors have chosen their favorites in those three categories. We also awarded a two-on-one tablet/laptop as well as our favorite standard tablet (spoiler: it's an iPad) and two of our favorite gaming devices to debut this year: a sweet PC/Xbox controller and an affordable AR/VR headset.

Why we love itWith the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7, we finally get a true Windows rival to Apple's MacBook Air. It has the build quality and design that puts it on equal footing with the Air, and it not only closes the battery-life gap that the Air had enjoyed over its Windows competition but actually surpasses it. The Surface Laptop 7 is a well-built ultraportable with unbeatable battery life and is one of the best Windows laptops we’ve seen this year.Who is it best for?The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7 is a great choice for anyone looking for a Windows laptop that offers a similarly sleek design and solid build as a MacBook along with an even better battery life. Based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor, this Copilot Plus PC offers strong overall performance and can run for nearly 20 hours on a single charge.Our favorite thingThe luxuriously long battery life is the best aspect of the Surface Laptop 7, but my favorite physical feature is the haptic touchpad. For an input device that you interact with hundreds, if not thousands, of times a day, the quality of a laptop’s touchpad is often overlooked. The Surface Laptop 7’s haptic touchpad offers a lively and customizable click response that’s far superior to the feel you get from a basic mechanical touchpad.-- Matt Elliott, senior editor Read our full review.

Why we love itWhile we’ve always liked the MacBook Air for its portability and battery life, the addition of Apple’s M-series chips really took the Air to the next level. It is a laptop that meets the needs of most people. And now that it comes in 13- and 15-inch sizes, you don’t have to move up to a pricier MacBook Pro just to get a larger display. Who is it best for?The M3 Air is a great pick for those who need a highly portable laptop for home, work or school that is not limited to the basics. It's an even better choice if you’re an iPhone or iPad user. Our favorite thingThe performance and battery life are great, but the fact that you get those in a slim, fanless body is why the M3 Air is our go-to recommendation for many people.– Josh Goldman, managing editor

Why we love itThe flashy slash programmable-LED on the cover plus solid performance make it an excellent well-rounded laptop for gaming, creating and everyday-ing -- without sacrificing style.Who is it best for?Thanks to smart design and tradeoffs for its 14-inch size plus an excellent OLED screen, the ROG Zephyrus G14 is a content creation crowd pleaser that has plenty left over for good gaming.What else to knowThe laptop has a surprisingly full set of ports for its size, with sufficient space between them that you shouldn't have any issues with larger-than-normal connectors. Asus also includes factory-calibration display profiles for sRGB, D65 P3 and DCI-P3, but not Adobe RGB. You can probably get away with a cheaper model (than the one we tested), with an RTX 4060 and 16GB RAM, if you play games at 1080p or lightweight ones at 1440p.– Lori Grunin, senior editor Read our full review.

Why we love itIt’s a great overall package for the price. In addition to the sturdy build quality, the keyboard is comfortable and quiet and the port selection is varied and useful. Based on an AMD Ryzen 8000-series processor, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 also delivers good performance for the price and lengthy battery life. It’s the two-in-one I recommend for most people for the value and versatility it provides.Who is it best for?With a great design, strong overall performance and outstanding battery life, the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9 is a well-rounded two-in-one laptop. It can regularly be found for less than $1,000 where it provides a ton of value and is a great fit as a versatile machine for home use and students. Our favorite thingGetting a solid, all-metal chassis at this price is our favorite part of the Yoga 7 14 Gen 9. Many sub-$1,000 models feature flimsy plastic designs, but this Yoga 7 14 boasts rigid, aluminum surfaces along with a firm display hinge that make it a pleasure to use in both laptop and tablet modes.– Matt Elliott Read our full review.

Why we love itSome tablets are good for entertainment, others for productivity and still others are good for creative pursuits. The 11-inch Duet somehow ably does all three for around $350 (and that price includes a keyboard cover). Plus, it lasted for 11 hours on our battery tests. Who is it best for?Anyone who wants a small secondary device for work and entertainment from anywhere. It’s also good for people who just need a simple computer for typical daily online tasks like shopping or chatting with friends and family. Our favorite thingLenovo packs in a lot of functionality at a reasonable price. Even if you get it maxed out on specs and bundled with its keyboard cover and pen, it’s still under $400. –   Josh Goldman Read our full review.
Apple iPad (10th generation, 10.2-inch)

Why we love itThe least expensive iPad is often the best iPad for most people, especially since so many iPads are for kids. This one’s getting old and may be upgraded next year, but it’s still the most affordable way to do iPad things, and its upgraded design, better-positioned front-facing camera for video chats and Apple keyboard case accessories make it feel a lot newer than older iPads before this.Who is it best for?Kids, families and anyone else who simply wants a basic, functional tablet to do things online, watch videos, play games and casually connect. Apple’s step-up iPad models have faster processors, support for newer, more fully featured Apple Pencil Pro styluses and, in the case of the Pros, better displays, but if that doesn’t matter to you, this is the iPad that will still do you just fine.Our favorite thingThis was the first iPad to get a shifted front camera placement. It’s on the long landscape edge, instead of the shorter portrait edge. In short, it means that video chats when a keyboard is attached, or when standing the iPad up on a table in landscape mode, look centered and like a laptop. Actually, better than most laptops, since Apple’s iPad cameras tend to be upgrades compared with what Macs offer.– Scott Stein, editor at large Read our full review.

Why we love itRazer’s fine-tuning of its Wolverine controller for Xbox and PC puts it in another league. Borrowing features from the PlayStation version, the V3 Pro has everything from two extra claw grip bumper buttons and four back paddles -- all remappable -- to Hall Effect thumbsticks and high-speed ultralow-latency wireless.Who is it best for?True to its name, the features and $200 price are aimed at serious gamers who want a competition-level wireless controller or who simply like to have the best of the best for gaming. If you can do without the wireless, Razer also has a wired Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition that has all the core features of the V3 Pro, but for $100 less.Our favorite thingThe sheer amount of controls the Wolverine V3 Pro has without feeling too cluttered or like you’re constantly hitting the wrong buttons. Plus, they can all be tweaked to your liking with Razer’s straightforward app.– Josh Goldman Read our full review.

Why we love itThere may not be a $300 device this year that offers more fun and upside than Meta’s mixed reality capable VR headset. The replacement to our longtime Editors' Choice Quest 2 is a budget version of Meta’s slightly fancier Quest 3 that came out last year. The 3S is $200 less expensive and has the same upgraded graphics and processing chips as the 3, plus much better color cameras that show the world around you more clearly than the Quest 2 did.Who is it best for?The Quest 3 is still our favorite VR headset thanks to its better, clearer lenses and higher resolution display, but the Quest 3S is a perfect choice for anyone who’s curious about VR or doesn’t want to spend a lot to try VR games, connect to a PC for VR experiences, or try fitness games and apps that add mixed reality (where the camera view of the world is mixed with VR graphics to make it feel like your worlds are mixing). It’s a great fitness device if you’re okay with wearing a headset during workouts: several great apps already work surprisingly well for cardio exercise.Our favorite thingThe price for the performance and functions of this headset is sort of astounding, and right now Meta’s including a free game (Batman: Arkham Shadow) as well. Also, the improved color cameras really make being in VR and still being aware of the world around you feel possible.– Scott Stein Read our full review.
Our favorite TV, streaming device and home audio giftsHome entertainment is a huge category, and let's face it: cheap TVs are a dime a dozen. That's why we focused our awards this year on two high-end TV models, both of which use OLED technology.

Why we love itOLED TVs have the best picture quality, and Samsung's best OLED TV for 2024 is the S95D. Unlike competitors, it has a matte screen to reduce reflections in bright rooms.Who is it best for?The Samsung S95D is best for viewers who want the superior image quality of OLED and are willing to pay extra for a picture that doesn't reflect brighter objects in the room, such as windows, lamps or other light sources, as brightly.What else to knowThe Samsung S95D's image quality is superb in both dark home theater situations and bright rooms. It has the brightest image we've tested on any OLED TV, exceedingly accurate color and all of the gaming features we expect at a TV of this level. It's available in only three screen sizes (55-, 65- and 77-inch) so if you want another size OLED TV, this isn't for you. Its design is also unusual, with a separate external box for HDMI and other connections to allow the TV itself to be extremely thin.–   David Katzmaier, senior director of content Read our full review.

Why we love itThe C4 delivers the superior image quality of OLED at a price that isn't incredibly expensive, and it's also available in a wide range of sizes from 42 to 83 inches.Who is it best for?The C4 is best for people who want OLED's image quality benefits, including excellent contrast and off-angle viewing, without having to pay through the nose.What else to knowTVs that have OLED screens routinely beat any other kind of television, including LCD and mini-LED TVs, in our side-by-side tests. The LG C4 didn't perform quite as well as the Samsung S95D in our comparison, but this LG costs hundreds less so we wouldn't blame you for choosing it instead. Of course the C4 has spectacular picture quality in its own right, anchored by the perfect black levels of OLED, and includes all of the important features and extras available on other high-end TVs.–   David Katzmaier Read our full review.
