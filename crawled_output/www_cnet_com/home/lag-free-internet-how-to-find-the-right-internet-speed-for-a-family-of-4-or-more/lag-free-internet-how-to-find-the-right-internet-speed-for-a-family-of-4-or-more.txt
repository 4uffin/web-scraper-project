There's a common misconception that there is a simple, universal answer to internet speed needs, such as choosing a plan based on the number of people in your household. The truth is that it's a bit more complicated than that. It's less about how many people are in your household and more about each person's digital lifestyle.  "I recommend families size their plan to their peak-hour routine," said Luke Kehoe, industry analyst at Ookla. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) He also emphasized the importance of focusing on peak use, rather than averages. You don't want your video call to lag at the end of the workday when your kids are doing homework or playing video games after school. Featured Deal 5G Home Internet for $30/month

Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesChoosing the right plan is essential for supporting your family's activities, from remote work to streaming to completing school assignments. A recent CNET survey found that 63% of US adults have seen their monthly internet costs increase within the past year, so balancing speed requirements with budgetary constraints is important. Here's what you need to know when shopping for the best internet for your household.
Locating local internet providers
Internet speed basics When comparing broadband plans and evaluating internet speeds, a few terms pop up frequently. Before you start shopping, here's what you'll want to be familiar with.
Mbps Mbps, or megabits per second, is used to measure bandwidth (the maximum amount of data that can be transferred over an internet connection in a specific amount of time), upload speed and download speed (until you get to gigabit territory). It measures how fast your internet connection is. A higher Mbps means that a larger amount of data is being transferred each second.
Locating local internet providers
Download versus upload speeds When shopping for internet plans, you'll need to be aware of two speeds: download and upload speeds. Download speed measures the volume of data coming in (streaming, browsing), while the upload speed is the data going out (video calls, uploading large files).  "Creators that upload a lot of content and files should pay particular attention to upload speed, which is often overlooked, but has become increasingly important," Kehoe told us.  Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.When shopping for plans for your family, be sure to check each plan's upload speed, as the download speed is most heavily advertised. The 500Mbps that you're looking at may actually have a much lower upload speed. According to Ookla, the median US household receives 285Mbps download, but just 48Mbps upload speeds. You may need to check the broadband nutrition label to find the upload speed. Although plans with symmetrical upload and download speeds are becoming more popular, Kehoe advises that families with multiple concurrent video calls, frequent cloud backups or creators in the house choose symmetrical or at least high-upload speed plans. But he notes that families that primarily use the internet for streaming and browsing may find asymmetrical plans acceptable, as the provided upload is at least 20 to 35Mbps.
Userba011d64_201/Getty Images Latency (ping) Latency, or ping, measures the connection's responsiveness. The lower the latency, the faster the response time.  It's an often-overlooked metric when shopping for internet but it makes a huge difference for real-time applications like online games or Zoom meetings. If you have a gamer in the family, a college student taking online courses or someone working from home, you'll want a plan with a low latency rate. Under 20 milliseconds is considered an excellent ping rate for serious gamers, live streamers or those who want to video conference in high definition. If you're a more casual gamer or just need to sign on to a basic Zoom meeting now and then, latency under 40ms should provide a smooth experience with minimal lag.
Bandwidth  Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred between points in a specified time period. It's typically measured in megabits per second, or Mbps.  Bandwidth is often confused with internet speed, but the two differ slightly. Bandwidth refers to how quickly data is transferred, while download speed measures how fast that data is received and downloaded. Both make a difference when downloading large files or streaming HD content.
Types of users Each individual in your household has internet consumption habits that will impact how much internet your family needs. Here are the most common user profiles. The power user Gamers or remote workers who need high upload and download speeds with low latency will require extra speed. For a smooth gaming experience and an internet plan with low latency, gamers will need at least 25Mbps of download and upload speed. Meanwhile, remote workers hopping on Zoom or Microsoft Teams for daily meetings will need a dedicated 2Mbps to 4Mbps in each direction to support real-time conversations.
The streamer If you have a sports fan or film enthusiast in your household, chances are that they spend plenty of time in front of the TV streaming content. Most smart TVs provide HD or 4K picture quality these days, which can require faster speeds and higher bandwidth to maintain a clear picture.
Tunvarat Pruksachat/Getty ImagesIf you're streaming shows, movies or sports, here are the average Mbps required, depending on the quality you prefer to stream in: Standard definition: 3 to 5MbpsHigh definition: 5 to 8Mbps4K: 25Mbps or moreKeep in mind that these numbers are for one device. If you have multiple TVs throughout your home, each stream will consume bandwidth and you may need faster internet speeds. For example, two people watching 4K movies simultaneously will need at least 50Mbps.
The casual user Some family members may keep it simple and use the internet primarily for email, social media and web browsing. This may require only 1 to 2Mbps per person. But keep in mind that it'll be a bit higher if they're watching HD live streams or primarily browsing video content (such as on TikTok or Instagram Reels). In this case, the use may be closer to 5 to 8Mbps.
The multidevice home Your phones, tablets and computers aren't the only devices using bandwidth. Most households have at least a few smart home devices. The term Internet of Things refers to the network of devices in your home that connect to the internet and share data.  Whether it's an Echo Dot speaker in your kid's room, a robot vacuum to simplify cleaning or some smart lights to brighten up your home, these IoT devices require Wi-Fi connectivity and can have a cumulative effect on your bandwidth. "Most IoT devices use little bandwidth but can clog airtime and create interference," explains Kehoe. In addition to choosing the right internet plan to support all the simultaneous device activity in your home, he recommends that families use a modern router supporting Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7.
MoMo Productions/Getty Images Most common home internet plan types Each provider's plan offerings differ, but you'll generally see plans in the following ranges. The 50Mbps-100Mbps plan is the baseline for a small family with moderate use. Plans in this range are typically selected as a budget-friendly option for those who primarily browse the web or watch videos on social media. The 200Mbps-500Mbps plan: This is the "sweet spot" for most active families with multiple users. It's fast enough to support high-bandwidth activities, like 4K streaming or HD video conferencing. Kehoe said that, "most larger households do well at 300Mbps–500Mbps down with 20Mbps–50Mbps up, scaling higher for heavy downloads."The Gig plan (1,000Mbps): Gig plans are becoming more popular, with many top internet service providers offering 1,000Mbps speeds for about $70 to $90. However, not all households require these extreme speeds. Paying for gig-level plans is typically only necessary if you have a large household with multiple power users, such as those engaging in competitive gaming, making simultaneous video calls or uploading large files frequently. How to choose a plan based on your family's needs Unsure which home internet plan is right for you? Try this simple, practical method to calculate the internet speed you need. Identify peak use hours: Determine your family's daily routines and what timeframes everyone will be online simultaneously.List all connected devices: This may include phones, laptops, smart TVs, gaming consoles, smart home devices and anything else connected to the internet. Estimate simultaneous activity: Decide what each person will likely be doing while you're all online simultaneously (e.g., one person streaming a TV show, another video conferencing, a third gaming, etc.).Add up the requirements: Tally up the estimated usage for each activity to get your minimum plan speed. Here are some examples.A family of fourDad (4K streaming): 25MbpsMom (HD video call): 4MbpsSon (online gaming): 20MbpsDaughter (browsing): 2MbpsTotal: 51MbpsA family of fiveMom (checking email): 2MbpsDad (online gaming): 20MbpsDaughter No. 1 (4K streaming): 25MbpsDaughter No. 2 (scrolling on social media): 5MbpsSon (4K streaming): 25MbpsTotal: 77Mbps It's best to give yourself a buffer and round up to handle use spikes and future growth. Plus, advertised speeds aren't always the exact speed you'll get daily. The advertised speeds describe the speed that you'll get through a wired Ethernet connection, but most of us connect our devices over Wi-Fi these days. On average, you lose about half the speed when connected to Wi-Fi, so look for a plan offering about double your minimum plan speed. In the first scenario, a plan of 100Mbps or more would be best for the family of four to ensure that everyone gets consistent broadband performance.
Too long; didn't read Choosing the right internet plan for your home is a strategic decision that can significantly impact your family's day-to-day activities. As technology evolves, so will your family's internet needs. The needs of individual household members can also change, with kids often spending more time online on schoolwork or video games as they age, or adult family members shifting to hybrid or remote work arrangements. When evaluating broadband plans, you should look for one that meets your current needs and anticipates tomorrow's demands.
