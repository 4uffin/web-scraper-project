Alexa can tell jokes, control appliances and more.Â  James Martin/CNET
As the weather starts warming, the days last longer, too. If you have kids, you'll already be making plans for ways to entertain them while school is out, but there are only so many things that you can do. Going out can get expensive, and you can only spray them with a water gun for so long before it starts to get old. That's where technology can help, and no, this doesn't have to involve a screen, just an Amazon Echo device.Out of all the digital assistants out there, Alexa is likely the one that you're most familiar with, with a recent CNET survey showing that 27% of US adults use it. After all, Alexa has been around for a long time, and a lot of people use it as a central hub for all their smart home gadgets. It's easy to use, with simple instructions including "Alexa, turn on the lights" and "Alexa, set a timer for five minutes." Amazon's digital assistant can even turn on your TV, play your favorite music, or check your home security cameras. And now that summer's here, it's time for Alexa to add some fun to your daily routine.There's plenty Alexa can do to keep you and your family entertained, especially if you have kids, young or old. Alexa can tell jokes, read a story to lull the little ones to sleep, or just offer up some random trivia. And Alexa can reference pop culture like Star Wars, play fun games and, yes, even fart to keep the kids giggling.What we're covering here is a more lighthearted side of Alexa. But it's just one of many ways to use Amazon's digital assistant. This Reddit discussion, for instance, mentions using an Echo device and some smart switches to help an elderly woman keep her verbal skills sharp when she doesn't have anyone to talk with.Back to those bored kids, though... Here's a list of 83 Alexa commands, involving questions, jokes, trivia and more, that'll help keep them occupied -- even on a long, long summer day.
