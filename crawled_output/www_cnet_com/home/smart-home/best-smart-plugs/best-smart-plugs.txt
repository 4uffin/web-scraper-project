Best overall smart plug
Emporia Smart Plug
Pros
Excellent energy management
Affordable at less than $15
Very easy account setup
Compact enough for most outlets
Cons
No Apple support
Not everyone wants so many energy management options
Why I like it:The Emporia smart plug combines affordability with excellent app operation and energy management, making it one of the best smart plugs I've come across with easy, highly customizable control. The rounded design and on/off side switch always proved top-notch.From the home screen display, you can see connected devices and their on/off status along with how much energy they are using. Tapping the plug or power icons will take you to the on/off settings or you can tap on the device name to see a graph of your plug's (that is, whatever's plugged into it) energy use over time. In addition to the charts, you can also set the plug for automatic scheduling to save energy or create your own schedules on the fly. It's intuitive and easy to master.The only disappointment I had with Emporia's plug is that it's not compatible with Apple Home (hopefully HomeKit support is on the way) and works best if you use Emporia's own app for detailed management, although Google Home/Gemini and Alexa compatibility are included.Who is this for:Buyers who want a smart plug with easy setup and excellent electricity management. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who aren't interested in tracking energy, users who need an Apple-compliant plug.  ... Show more

Best budget smart plug
TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini
Pros
Affordable at less than $15
Customized scheduling options
Very compact size
Cons
Lacking energy management options
Why I like it:I've tested the TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini before and it remains one of my favorite plugs, especially for those who want an affordable option. This smart device works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant via your Wi-Fi network and the Kasa app (Android and iOS) offers plenty of detailed options for customizing scheduling, away modes and timers. Alas, this Wi-Fi smart plug doesn't offer energy-consumption data, a USB port or HomeKit compatibility, which keeps it from the very top of my list even if other features are excellent.Who is this for:Users who want an extra-affordable, simple plug. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who need USB ports or energy monitoring.

Best smart plug for Apple HomeKit and Matter
Leviton D215P-2RW
Pros
Apple compatibility thanks to Matter, which is hard to find in smart plugs
Inituive app with home/away modes, vacation mode and more
Handy indicator light/button
Cons
Expensive compared to alternatives at more than $20
Why I like it:I liked the Leviton D215P-2RW smart plug right out of the box. For a smart plug, it has a sleek design. I'm particularly fond of the little corner window that acts as a button to manually turn the device on and off and as an indicator light -- features that most smart plugs keep separated. It's also slimmer than most smart plugs I've seen, which is nice if you're working with a limited space.Design aside, I found the Leviton smart plug easy to set up and the app is pleasantly simple. The home screen displays all connected plugs (or other Leviton smart devices) and their status, along with the ability to switch them on or off with a tap. Setting a schedule for the plug was also easy and intuitive.Another standout feature of the Leviton smart plug: Thanks to its Matter support, it plays nicely with all three of the major smart home ecosystems. I had no problem connecting the smart plug to my Google Home Mini but I did have to download the Leviton "skill" to connect to Alexa. It's an extra step but one that only took about 30 seconds. Leviton is also compatible with Apple HomeKit and Siri, which is somewhat rarer for a smart plug.Who is this for:Apple fans looking for a high-quality, Matter-compatible smart plug.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don't need a lot of compatibility features.  ...

Best smart plug for easy setup
GE Cync Smart Plug
Pros
Excellent app controls for swift management
Quick voice assistant connections for Alexa and Google
A variety of Cync routines with other devices
Cons
Needs compatible smart home devices to really shine
More than $25 when not on sale
Why I like it:Speaking of apps, GE's Cync app is nothing short of delightful. The initial smart plug setup took me through a series of simple, step-by-step instructions complemented by soft, home-inspired imagery in the background. The setup also prompted me to connect to Alexa and Google devices, something I had to navigate to within the app or go to a hub to do with other smart plugs.Once your smart plug is set up, you can control on/off settings from the home screen or tap "Routines" to set a schedule. There are a number of other functions and settings you can play with, such as grouping devices together for simultaneous control or creating "scenes" with custom settings, like turning off a set of lights before starting a movie or changing the smart light bulbs to your team's color on game day. If it sounds complicated, you can get a user-friendly, eye-pleasing breakdown of how to use all the various Cync features under Settings > App Tutorials.I'm getting away from the smart plug a bit but that's because the GE Cync app is clearly intended to incorporate multiple devices and support total home automation. You can use the smart plug on its own but the app invites you to do much more.Who is this for:People who want an elegant, excellent app experience for their smart plug. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who aren't interested in smart home stuff like routines, grouping and device management.  ... Show more

Best dual outlet smart plug
HBN Smart Plug
Pros
Two outlets with separate control functions
Convenient app design
Very affordable at less than $10
Cons
No Apple support for this model, either
Why I like it:You get two for the price of one here. The HBN smart plug is one of the few I've seen with two independently controlled outlets. Even with the extra outlet, the smart plug isn't that much wider than other single plugs and it's still compact enough to plug something else in above or below it.I'm sure there are quite a few uses for a dual smart plug but plugging my Christmas tree lights into one and a corner lamp into the other immediately comes to mind. Currently, I have a light fixture and a fan plugged in and the ability to independently control one or the other is pretty nifty. I also found the HBN to be user-friendly, and for alternatives its voice assistant is compatible with Alexa and Google. Each outlet is nameable, so you can turn off a single outlet by saying "Alexa, turn off Switch 2," or control both outlets at once by referring to the device name.You can also create separate schedules for each outlet. Here at home, I've set my fan to come on during these sweltering Southern summer days while the lamp is programmed to come on at night. Again, pretty nifty.Who is this for:Buyers who want two outlets on their plug.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who prefer a more compact plug and only want to use it with one device.

Amazon Smart Plug
Pros
Native Alexa compatibility
Auto-reconnect to the Alexa app
Swift setup if you're comfortable with Alexa
Cons
More than $20 is quite expensive for a smart plug
Why I like it:Amazon's own entry into the smart plug market is, to no surprise, incredibly compatible with Alexa. If you already use the Alexa app, that makes this plug particularly easy to set up, with no need to create another account or learn any third-party app. In addition to all those Alexa voice commands (and any Alexa Plus improvements that may come in the future), Amazon designed the plug to automatically re-connect with Alexa if it suddenly goes offline, a boon during power outages.Who is this for:Alexa fans who want a painless setup process.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who prefer Google/Gemini and Apple support.  ...

Other smart plug models we tested
It's the smallest plug in my smart home. John Carlsen/CNETThere are dozens of smart plugs out there from companies large and small and, while we haven't tested every single one, we've tried out many of the ones you'd come across online or at your local big box store. Here's a quick look at other notable options:ConnectSense Smart Outlet 2: This smart plug does it all -- energy monitoring, individually controlled outlets, a USB port and LED status lighting. The unattractive, oversized design is enough to keep us from recommending it. Everyone loves a smart outlet but no one likes an ugly one.Govee Smart Wi-Fi Plug: The round design is nice and blends in with my wall plate perfectly while leaving plenty of room for another plug. Nothing else really stands out about the plug, unfortunately, but if you want a simple, cheap (currently $10) plug that doesn't scream "I'm a smart plug," this is a good choice.Philips Hue Smart Plug: The Philips Hue app reminded me of GE's Cync app in that the setup was simple and there's the potential to connect multiple devices under whole-home automation. For a single smart plug, this one is fairly expensive at $35 (currently $28) and it doesn't sport any unique features to justify the cost. Wyze: We like the Wyze Smart Plug primarily for its low pricing. The Wyze does all the basic functions of a smart plug and will only set you back $20 for a two-pack. The bargain price is nice but if you only need one plug, there are cheaper options.Enbrighten Dual Smart Plug (Update: Out of Stock): As with the HBN smart plug, I appreciated the extra outlet. The Enbrighten version is significantly wider and doesn't allow for individual control of each outlet, at least not in any way that I could easily figure out. It's also priced a bit higher than the HBN dual outlet at $22.Vont Smart Plug (Update: Out of Stock): Your standard smart plug. Nothing special but nothing that would turn me away from using it, either. If you can catch it on sale, or perhaps in a value-priced two-pack, this smart plug can be a decent, budget-friendly addition to your smart home.WeMo (Update: Out of Stock): We previously featured this smart plug as "Best for HomeKit" in spite of other shortcomings like a less-than-impressive app. Yes, the smart plug works well with a HomeKit setup along with Alexa and Google but so does the more user-friendly Leviton plug.
What does a smart plug work with?
Linkind/CNETSmart plugs generally work with any device that can fit into a standard American outlet socket (or the standard socket in your region of choice). They work best with devices that have simple on/off states and can start running immediately when turned on. The classic example is a coffeemaker set to start brewing the moment its smart plug is activated but there are a lot of other possibilities -- grow lights, fountain pumps, energy-hogging displays, bedside lamps that can join your alarm in waking you up, and a whole lot more.Read more: Want to Buy a Smart Plug? Read This First Factors to consider when choosing a smart plug
Amazon/CNETPriceThe good news is that smart plugs are super affordable and their apps are free to use. However, if you’re on a strict budget it may be worthwhile to look for options that are less than $20. Most of our plug choices are about $15. We even have one or two less than $10, although you may lose some features at prices that low.Size and designSize is especially important for smart plugs because we only have so much room around our outlets. You may be plugging in other appliances to the spare socket or the outlet may not have much room for a plug to protrude. Compact is usually better as a result. You don’t want a plug that goes out much beyond the edges of the outlet, for example.Other important design features include a physical on/off button, which some users find very important, and indicator lights to see the status of the plug. Smart home support and MatterSmart home support can be very convenient for voice assistants and routines, but compatibility can vary. Apple compatibility is still relatively rare so if you prefer Apple make sure your plug works with HomeKit. Google and Alexa compatibility are more common but ultimately you’ll want home compatibility that your smart devices already have, or what you’re comfortable using.Energy managementMany smart plugs offer energy management and electricity tracking, which is excellent if you want to see what devices are power hungry and arrange schedules to save money. We prefer these energy management options but not everyone is interested in them and they can make apps a bit more confusing to use.
TP-Link/CNETApp controlsApp UI is important even for simple devices like smart plugs. We chose options that are easy to manage and quick to set up, especially with processes like scheduling on/off times. Apps shouldn’t be cluttered with unnecessary content or take a long time to find what you’re looking for.AmpsMost smart plugs are rated for 15A, suitable for most basic devices. But if your device uses more amps than that (like a small heater, for example) you need to find a smart plug that has a higher wattage rating to avoid problems.Scheduling and modesHigh-quality smart plugs should always have the option for scheduling times to turn on or off. More advanced models may offer home/away modes based on location tracking Outdoor ratingThis list focuses on indoor smart plugs but we have a guide for outdoor models, too. If you plan on using the smart plug outdoors, it absolutely needs weather resistance (usually with an IP rating) and a design that allows for outdoor functioning.
How we test smart plugs
Smart plugs can be really handy in many ways, but there are still limitations regarding what can be safely used with them. Chris Wedel/CNETTesting a smart plug is relatively straightforward, thanks to the simplicity of these smart home gadgets (which is also why they're such a great starting place). We test these plugs in our own homes, running through several phases. App setup and installationFirst we pay close attention to the setup process and how easy it is to get the smart plug up and running. We like to see apps that are easy to understand and preferably options that don't require an extra account to set up. This is also the period where we take a close look at the physical design of the plug, how compact it is and what features it has, such as LED indicators and physical switches.
Emporia has more comprehensive and user-friendly energy management options than most -- but you may need other Emporia devices to use them all.  Tyler Lacoma/CNETPower management and schedulingAs we hook up devices for testing, we start looking at scheduling features and how easy it is to turn devices on or off remotely. If plugs are compatible with another app like Alexa or Google Home, we connect them and test control features from there, too. We like to see scheduling options that are easy to set and adjust on the fly. Energy management and savingsMany smart plugs also include electricity tracking and energy management options. Here, we experiment with how easy it is to watch energy use over time (usually a few days connected to an appliance) and if the app offers features to cut down on electricity use, like automatically turning the device off at peak hours.

What we updated
The Eve Energy smart plug works with Matter right out of the box and hits stores March 28. EveSpring 2025: After excellent testing with Emporia's smart plug, I decided to move it to the top of the list for anyone interested in energy management. Also, I added the Amazon smart plug as an option for Alexa users who want particularly speedy setups.
Smart plug FAQs
Why use a smart plug?
Smart plugs are one of the cheapest and simplest ways to add smart technology to non-smart devices such as lamps, nightlights and fans. A smart plug will give you control over the flow of power to plugged-in devices via an app on your phone or using your voice when paired with a compatible home assistant like Alexa or HomeKit. For example, you could say, "Alexa, turn on the dining room lamp" from anywhere in the house. Smart plugs also enable you to create schedules to automatically turn the device on or off at specified times. Some plugs come with other features such as energy use monitoring but conveniently turning your devices "on" or "off" is the main purpose of a smart plug.
Which smart plug should I buy?
When choosing the best smart plug for your needs, start by identifying which voice assistant you'll be using, if any. Most plugs are compatible with Alexa and Google, but finding one that is compatible with HomeKit may be more of a challenge. Look for Matter compatibility, which indicates that a plug also functions with Apple Home and Siri.Next, compare the size and style of each smart plug. Most smart plugs are compact but some can be rather bulky and may block access to other outlets. Some are rectangular, others may have rounded edges or a circular shape, which tends to blend in better with the wall plate. Pick the one that best fits your home's style and space.Extra features like energy monitoring and USB charging can add even more control and convenience but consider how often you may use these added features before paying a higher price for a smart plug that does more than you need it to.
Do smart plugs save energy?
Smart plugs themselves do not lower energy consumption but the use of a smart plug is a great way to control and potentially lower your energy use. Setting a schedule for a light to turn off at a certain time, for example, will keep it from staying on continuously. Or you could set an away mode so certain devices always turn off when you aren't at home, saving money. Some smart plugs, such as the Emporia Smart Plug, feature energy-use monitoring along with automatic settings to turn devices on or off depending on your energy consumption. Again, the smart plug itself does not save energy but using a smart plug and taking advantage of its features can help keep your energy use in check.
What is the difference between a smart outlet and smart plug?
A smart outlet replaces your existing wall outlet and requires installation (often with wiring), while a smart plug simply plugs into your existing outlet with no installation needed. Smart outlets are permanent and flush with the wall, while smart plugs are portable and can be moved between outlets. Smart outlets typically offer a cleaner look, but smart plugs are more affordable and usually don't require electrical work.
Is there anything you should not plug into a smart plug?
You should avoid plugging high-powered appliances like heaters, air conditioners, dehumidifiers or anything that draws more than 1,800 watts into a smart plug, as these can overload the plug's circuitry. You should also avoid major appliances like refrigerators, washing machines and dryers, as they need consistent power and could be damaged by unexpected power cycling. Finally, avoid medical devices or anything else that requires constant, uninterrupted power.Also, keep in mind most indoor smart plugs are rated for 15 amps, suitable for the average American outlet. Some devices, like space heaters, may draw more amperage, which can be dangerous for the smart plug over time.
What's the difference between Thread, Zigbee, Z-Wave and Wi-Fi smart plugs?
Thread, Zigbee and Z-Wave are all special connections that smart plugs may use to communicate with certain hubs. They aren't usually necessary for a standalone smart plug. Wi-Fi, of course, allows you to connect the smart plug to your router and then operate it via your phone app, making it a required connection.
Can smart plugs be used outdoors?
No, not unless they are specifically rated for outdoor use. It could be dangerous to use indoor smart plugs outdoors if it leads to a short circuit. We have a list of outdoor smart plugs here.
What is a Matter-certified smart plug?
Matter is a smart home standard that, among other things, helps guarantee compatibility with voice assistants and apps like Alexa, Apple Home and Google Home. It's an especially good way to guarantee functionality with Apple and Siri, which is otherwise hard to find.
