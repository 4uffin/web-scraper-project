You can also control them on demand with a simple voice command or connect them to other smart home routines you have, like turning on when your door is unlocked. Our Picks

Recent updates
I and other CNET reviewers have tested dozens of the latest smart lights from top brands like Philips Hue, Lifx, Govee, GE Cync and many others. I ultimately chose nine of the very best to use inside and outside of your home.What is the best smart light?
Wiz smart light bulbs offer an impressive range of tunable whites and a nifty trick of acting like motion sensors for automations. Chris Wedel/CNETMy top pick, especially for anyone just starting out with smart lights, is the ultra-simple Wiz Tunable bulb. There's not much this small bulb can't do, from Matter compatibility for Alexa, Google Home and Siri to 16 million color options and the ability to change brightness levels. And because you can find this bulb for about $10, it's not hard to switch multiple bulbs in your home over to smart versions. Best smart lights

Best all-around smart bulb
Wiz LED Smart Light Bulb (Color)
Pros
Very affordable
No hub required
Matter support for Alexa, Siri and Google Home
Color changing
Motion-sensing when multiple bulbs are added
Cons
Not for every scenario like outdoor lighting
Brightness is a little low at 800 lumens compared to some of my picks
Why I like it: After testing more smart bulbs that I can count, I kept returning to this convenient Wiz bulb that had everything I wanted in a standard A19/E26 home bulb filled with smart features, all for about $10. For the latest updates to the list, I upgraded Wiz’s model to the color version, which is only about $2 more expensive and gives you millions of colors to choose from if you want.Otherwise, the bulb shines with its Matter support that allows you to use Siri, Alexa, or Google Home to control the bulb and connect it to smart home routines, without the need for any additional app. There are also lots of scheduling options and automation tricks, from only turning on after sunset to reacting to motion as someone moves throughout the house.Who is this for:Anyone looking for a cheap smart bulb that fits in any standard home socket and works with everything without a hub.Who shouldn't buy it: Those looking for more complex color and syncing options or people who need a floodlight or other type of bulb.  ...

Best smart BR30 floodlight
Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance Bulb
Pros
Great bulb design
Useful app UI with quick mood and scene options without a lot of tinkering
Lots of brightness options to choose from
White or color ambiance
Cons
The bulb is already pricey at about $45 and requires an expensive hub to enable remote app controls
Why I like it:Smart floodlight bulbs exist too and they’re perfect for larger indoor spaces (especially because they tend to last a lot longer than incandescents before you need to replace them). I’ve testing many LED floodlights, and one of my favorite smart versions is this Philips Hue mode.Philips Hue is a particularly reliable brand for durability, app UI and smart features. This bulb shows off with white and color options, detailed brightness settings and a variety of scenes you can pick from and set to get just the shade you want without having to mess with app controls very much.The bulb works automatically with Bluetooth, Alexa and Google Home, but to add remote control through Wi-Fi (which I highly recommend) or Apple compatibility, you will need a Hue Bridge ($65). It’s the one issue that Philips Hue still struggles with for many of its bulbs, so consider the extra cost before you buy.Who is this for:Buyers willing to invest in the Philips Hue ecosystem to support an array of durable LED floodlights and other lighting.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want to avoid paying extra for a bridge device or people who don’t want a color floodlight.  ...

Best color-changing smart bulb
GE Cync Dynamic Effects BR30 Bulb
Pros
Unique four-part color lighting for imaginative lighting
No hub required
Excellent app UI for controls
Cons
No Apple support
Slightly dim for a floodlight bulb
Why I like it:I bet you’ve never seen a floodlight bulb quite like this before. I certainly came away impressed after testing the GE Cync Dynamic Effects bulb, which has four quadrants that can each turn a different color according to your settings, mixing and matching shades to provide the ideal ambiance for anything from parties and movie nights to romantic dinners or Christmas get-togethers.If you love color changing, this bulb gets top marks but I am also very impressed with the Cync app, which is especially easy to understand and use for such a complex bulb. It also offers music syncing for more in-depth displays. Amazon and Google Home support is a welcome addition but there’s no Apple support here yet.Who is this for:Buyers who want to play with colors to get the perfect room ambiance, even with just one bulb.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who need Apple support, users who find the four-quadrant color thing too complicated or buyers who don’t want a floodlight bulb.  ...

Best budget smart light
Wyze Bulb White 2-pack
Pros
Easy setup
Very affordable
A handy group control option
Fun sunlight-matching and similar settings
No hub needed
Cons
No Apple support
No color options
Why I like it:If you’re looking for a quick, cheap bulbs, especially a multi-bulb solution for several upgrades around your home, Wyze bulb packs don’t disappoint. I found these bulbs, which are just as affordable as my $10 top pick, to be especially easy to set up and control. That’s even more true if you purchase multiple bulbs at once, thanks to the smart group control setting.While these bulbs are white light only, I appreciated how there were still customization options, including changing the color temperature to warmer or cooler colors, matching the sunlight color throughout the day and shifting the brightness. Alexa and Google Home controls are supported, as are scheduling and on-demand timers to turn the bulbs off after a certain period.Who is this for:Buyers who want cheap smart bulbs that are easy to control in groups.Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who prefer the option to change color or who need floodlight bulbs.  ...

Best high brightness smart bulb
Tapo Smart Wi-Fi Light Bulb, Multicolor
Pros
High 1,100 lumen brightness
Matter support for Alexa, Google Home and Siri
Easy ways to change brightness or color temperature as needed
Cons
Slightly more expensive than the most affordable smart bulbs unless you find it on sale
Why I like it:Tapo’s bulb is another great smart color light that remains quite affordable, similar to my top Wiz pick. However, I gave this bulb a different accolade -- at 1,100 lumens, it’s one of the brightest on my list, a handy fit for dark spaces that need extra illumination or craft rooms/workbenches that need to push brightness to high levels during certain projects.Tapo’s bulb is also Matter-certified, so it works with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Siri. If you don’t like that brightness, you can shift it down or switch to another color, or adjust the color temperature to a warmer option. That makes this bulb a complete answer for all kinds of illumination.Who is this for:People looking for an especially bright smart bulb that remains affordable and can also change color.Who shouldn’t buy it:Buyers more interested in soft, lower-brightness lighting or buyers who need floodlights.  ...

Best outdoor smart light
Lifx Color BR30 Bulb
Pros
IP65 weather resistance
1,100 lumens
Color changing
Support for Alexa, Google Home, and Apple
Cons
Won’t fit in every outdoor light space, like lights that need to be wired in
Why I like it:Most smart home lighting is indoor-only bulbs, but I’ve tested a few outdoor models as well. This Lifx model proved to be my favorite, combining a high 1,100 lumen rating with IP65 weather resistance for outdoor use. It also supports Wi-Fi without needing an indoor hub, and works with Alexa, Google Home/Gemini and Apple Siri. You can even change the color and color temperature to what suits your home routine best. That’s quite the complete package for an outdoor bulb, just make sure your socket supports a BR30/E26 bulb design.Who is this for:Buyers looking for an outdoor smart lightWho shouldn’t buy it:People who need to have an outdoor light connection that doesn’t support a BR30 design/E26 base.  ...

Best smart light strip
Govee LED Strip Light
Pros
Smart color changing
Expansive music syncing options with 11 modes
Dozens of scenes for pre-made effects
Multiple lengths
Cons
Cannot be cut to size
So many modes may be confusing for some users
Why I like it:I’ve been impressed with Govee light strips in the past, but this newer model is one of the best possible if you want to pick a light strip of a certain length while still giving it plenty of smarts. Those smarts come courtesy of the detailed Govee app, which allows you to customize colors, enable music sync (with 11 music modes to play around with) or choose from different scenes depending on the mood of the room. The strips also work with Alexa and Google Home.Obviously, light strips aren’t for everyone but I’ve found them to be a handy and sometimes beautiful solution for outlining displays, TVs, bedframes and stairs around the home. Just make sure you choose the right length, which varies from 16.4 to 100 feet. You can’t cut this smart light strip to size.Who is this for:Buyers looking for smart accent lights that can sync to music or party themes with detailed app controls.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don’t want smart strip light or buyers looking for the kinds of strip lighting you can cut.  ...

Best smart light panels
Govee Mini Panel Lights
Pros
Smart LED panels for colorful and imaginative displays
Govee’s light syncing and scenes options
Alexa and Google support
Tech makes app controls for colors easy to use
Cons
One panel will need to have a nearby plugin
No Apple support
Why I like it:For a more entertaining, front-and-center smart lighting choice, this Govee smart panel set can be a centerpiece or an accompaniment to another display. The little light square (a set of 20, but the adapter supports up to 70) are highly versatile, whether you are giving a bedroom some mood lighting or setting up a gaming space. You’ll want one of the lights close enough to an outlet to plug in, but otherwise you’re free to plot your own shapes.Govee’s color options are on full display here, with dozens of scenes and music sync options. Plus, with Matter support you can use Google and Alexa to control them, although Apple hasn’t quite made it here yet.Who is this for:Buyers with an eye for entertaining, customizable light shows and a big imagination.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want more traditional lights used primarily for illumination.  ...

Best solar smart light for outdoors
Ring Pathlight Solar
Pros
Solar powered
Works with other Ring products and Alexa
Simple setup
Cons
Requires Ring Bridge
Why I like it: Outdoor lighting is key to a safe and secure home, so upgrading to smart outdoor lights that double as motion detectors and sync with your security system makes a lot of sense. For my money, the best way to get there is with Ring, which offers a full portfolio of affordable outdoor smart lights, all of which can sync up with your Ring cameras and sync up with Alexa for voice control, too.My favorites of the bunch are the Ring Pathlights, especially the new solar-powered version pictured above. At just $30 a pop on Amazon, each one includes a built-in motion sensor that can turn on a light or a group of lights whenever someone passes by, and they can trigger your Ring cameras to start recording, too. That's a great way to build a smart home that's aware of what's going on outside. You'll need a Ring Bridge in your home to use the more advanced smart features (which I recommend), but these often come bundled with the Pathlight so you can save money.Who is this for:Buyers looking for a smart light that can illuminate a path, porch, deck step or similar spot.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don’t want any smarts on their landscaping lights, users who don’t like Alexa or buyers who want serious illumination instead of safety lights.  ...

Ry Crist/CNETKasa Smart Light Bulb: TP-Link’s Kasa brand bulb is another cheap and effective smart light option, although it was slightly outclassed by the Tapo mode and a couple of my other best budget picks.Govee LED Smart Light Bulb: Govee’s color smart bulb is an excellent choice if you like to play with colors, which is one reason I chose Govee for more entertainment-oriented picks on this list.Philips Hue White Ambiance Bulb: This white bulb is a fine example of Philips Hue lighting, but overall I prefer the color version so people have the option to change things up.Philips Hue Smart 75W A19 LED Bulb: Hue bulbs can be a good choice if you plan on getting a lot of them, but most Hue bulbs need a hub, which keeps many of them off my list in favor of bulbs that have Wi-Fi capabilities built in.Sengled Smart LED Color Changing Bulb: I’ve tested Sengled’s bulb and I like it but it’s almost twice as expensive as other bulbs that do all the same things and requires a hub for full functionality, keeping it off the list.Lutron Caseta Original Smart Dimmer Switch: This dimmer switch tested very well, although I decided to leave it off a list focusing on the lights themselves. However, if you prefer a smart switch instead, this is a great starting point.Sylvania Smart Plus: Much like Sengled, this light bulb is held back by the higher price and a need for a hub.Govee Envisual TV LED Backlight: This is, hands down, the best TV backlight I’ve ever seen and it’s almost scarily smart, although you will need to attach a little camera to the top of your TV for the full effect. It didn’t quite make this list, which is focused on more general smart lighting, but for a home theater this is certainly an option. Factors to consider when choosing a smart light
Philips Hue Connected Bulb starter packYou might not have an obvious need for an Internet-connected, color-changing light bulb, but the
Any smart LED bulb excels at saving energy. That’s why they use “watt equivalent” numbers and lumens, because the actual wattage is so low. But what else should you look for when buying your bulb? Here are several features I think are especially important.Is a hub required?Some smart lights require a hub to connect to Wi-Fi and allow for remote operation, which is a very useful feature for most homes. Fortunately, most newer bulbs no longer need hubs, but you still find some models where it’s required. I always prefer versions that don’t require hubs to work, as it’s so much easier.BrightnessThe average smart bulb is about 800 lumens but has the option to control brightness levels. Some LED panels and more specialized bulbs go beyond 1,000 lumens if you want a higher brightness level.Color changesYou don’t always need a bulb that can change colors, but it’s a useful addition for home routines, various kinds of mood lighting and other tricks. I try to recommend bulbs with color options when possible, especially as there’s no longer much difference in price for a color upgrade.
The Apple HomeKit ecosystem has grown recently and the addition of Matter support only make it grow more. Chris Wedel/CNETColor temperatureColor temperature, measured in Kelvin, describes how cool or warm a light looks. Even if a smart light can’t fully change color, it’s often valuable to find a light that can switch color temperatures to find exactly the look you want.App controlsSmart light controls should be easy to use with useful settings and clear UI. Smart lights are generally simple products: The apps shouldn’t be confusing at all. If you already have a preferred brand in tech apps, see if they have smart lights. Additional features like sunrise/sunset settings and quick scheduling are also welcome.Music syncingSome smart lights have the ability to sync to music. If that’s important for your plans, choose a bulb with these capabilities. Brands like Philips Hue, Govee and, yes, GE Cync have options to enable automatic music syncing in their apps.
I linked my Govee smart light strips to Alexa without an Echo device in sight. John Carlsen/CNETVoice assistant and app supportIf you have a preferred voice assistant or a preferred home platforms like Alexa, Google Home, Apple Home, etc., make sure your smart bulb supports it. Most smart bulbs support multiple platforms, but Apple support is a little less common.Type of bulb socketCommon home light bulbs use E26 sockets but you should always double-check the sockets or connections in the lights you want to make sure you are getting a smart light that will fit them.Indoor/outdoorMany smart lights are indoor but it can also be useful to install an app-controlled light on a porch, patio or other outdoor area. If the bulb is going to be exposed to the weather, it needs to have weather resistance like an IP rating, or it could stop working. How we test smart lights
These inexpensive Hue bulbs don't change color, nor do they allow you to change the color temperature. But they are Alexa-enabled, and will set you back just $50 for a pack of four. Tyler Lizenby/CNETAt CNET, we’ve tested more smart bulbs and smart lighting products than we can count. There’s a bit more to it than just finding an empty socket and screwing in a bulb. Here’s what we look for when we test.Brightness and colorWe check that the light bulb meets its expected lumen level and test different levels of brightness to make sure it can dim reliably and accurately. If the bulb has color options, we test a variety of colors to check their accuracy and how they affect a room.App use and settingsWhen we pull out the smart light app, we have several questions. Is the bulb easy to set up and connect? Is the app easy to navigate and understand, especially when you’re looking for a certain setting? Does the app protect your privacy while making logins simple? Does it have annoying ads or screen clutter?
Many smart devices have vacation or away modes you can set up to simulate a lived-in house. CNETGeneral design and durabilityWe also check to make sure the smart bulb is well-designed and not easily damaged during use. When possible, we test smart bulbs for at least several days to see if they experience any issues with unexpected burnout or performance problems.Smart home platform supportThis is also the time we bring up apps like Apple Home, Google Home and Alexa to see how easy the smart bulbs are to detect and connect, and if those connections are stable over time.Syncing and tricksMany smart bulbs offer extra features, like syncing to music or the ability to change based on daylight in the region. We also pull up settings like these and play with them to make sure they work correctly and are useful or at least fun.
Recent updates
August 2025: I gave our guide a complete update with the latest models that I and other CNET reviewers have tested, making sure we’re only recommending the latest and greatest lights for your home. The new list includes picks from brands we’ve liked for years, including Wiz, Tapo, Govee and Cync.
FAQs on smart lights
Which smart lighting system is the best?
The choice depends on your home and specific needs. My list above includes my favorite brands for this kind of lighting, such as Wiz, Tapo, Philips Hue, Lifx, Govee and GE Cync, which are all hard to go wrong with. Just make sure the lights you choose have the customization options that you really want.
Is it worth getting smart lights?
In most cases, yes. Their LEDs tend to last a long time while saving electricity compared to other types of lighting, and that alone is useful. The smart features allow you to control your lighting from anywhere or set it to the exact brightness and color that you like, options that normal lights just don’t have. I’m not saying every light in your home needs to be smart, but at least a few can be helpful.
Do smart lights work without Wi-Fi?
Yes, many smart lights can work with Bluetooth. However, without a Wi-Fi connection, you won’t be able to control your lights when you’re away from home, only when you’re in closer range.
Do smart lights deter burglars?
Burglars are most likely to be deterred by lights connected to a smart security camera that can shine a spotlight or floodlight when they detect a human approaching. Standard smart lights don’t do much to prevent trespassers on their own.
