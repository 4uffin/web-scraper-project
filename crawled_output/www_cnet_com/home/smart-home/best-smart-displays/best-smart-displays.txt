Smart home ecosystem
Buy the smart display that uses the same voice assistant you are already using to ensure seamless integration.
Personal use
Smart displays come in many different sizes, so be sure to get the one that best matches your primary use.
Where you plan to put it
Some smart displays can be wall mounted to free up counter or table space, others can't so the larger models will take up more room on table.

What is the best smart display overall?
Smart displays are easy ways to keep eyes on loved ones. Google NestThe Google Nest Hub 2nd-gen display ($100) combines some of the top smart features we tested in a display that's more affordable than most, a particularly ideal pick for Nest users that looks great on a computer desk, kitchen counter or (with sleep sensor features) beside a bed. It's a great centerpiece or companion display, plus it offers compatibility for both Google and Alexa platforms. It doesn't have a camera for video chatting, but many of our other picks do, including some with much larger screens. Whether you're looking to enhance your existing setup with a smart display or are just starting your smart home journey, leave behind the Google Home app -- or Alexa app -- on your phone and switch to the top smart displays. CNET's experts tested and reviewed several to help you identify the best options on the marketplace.

Best overall smart display
Google Nest Hub (2nd gen)
Pros
At $100 it's more affordable than larger displays
Quick Gestures for hands-free control
Upgraded base
Easy internet searching with Google voice assistant
Cons
Sleep Sensing will eventually cost $10 per month (currently free)
Big bezel remains
No camera means no video chat
The transition to Gemini AI will bring unknowns
Why I like it:The latest version of the Nest Hub with Google services arrived in 2021, and it's a great entry point for the category. It's the smartest and best overall, making the lower price even more appealing. Thanks to the built-in Google Assistant (which will be replaced with Google Gemini AI before long), the Nest Hub responds to all of the same voice command options as the Google Home Mini smart speaker. The Google smart display touchscreen is a little small at 7 inches, but the adaptive brightness makes pictures look particularly great. Like most smart displays, Google will customize a slideshow of family pics as your screensaver. You can also control your smart home devices, such as your smart doorbell, with an intuitively designed control panel. Unlike most of the other smart displays (and unlike its big brother, the Nest Hub Max), the Nest Hub doesn't have a camera, but that might be a bonus if you have privacy concerns and want to put it on your bedside table.The second-generation smart home hub model includes Sleep Sensing and Quick Gestures thanks to Google's Soli mini radar. The colorful fabric design on this Google Assistant smart display allows the device to blend in anywhere, although the tablet touchscreen comes in handy if you want step-by-step help through a recipe in the kitchen.Who is this for:This is for all fans of Google Nest, people who want a more affordable display and are willing to settle for a smaller device, and those who would prefer not to have a camera included for privacy.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want video chats, who don't like Google Home or Nest devices and those who would prefer the Nest Hub Max for its larger screen.  ...

The best smart display with camera
Amazon Echo Show 8 (2023)
Pros
The 8-display has impressive detail and lighting
Alexa's response time is near-immediate
Improved display menus from older versions
Spatial audio for better sound
Cons
Alexa's privacy settings leave something to be desired
Upward firing speaker isn't as good for music as other displays
$150 is more expensive than the Nest Hub
Why I like it:We're putting the Echo Show 8 and the Nest Hub second-gen on more or less equal footing for this list. The Show 8 is around the same size, but switches the platform to Alexa and adds a camera for video chatting. Add that to Amazon Alexa's growing smarts, and we recommend both models as excellent smart displays.With the Show 8, Alexa will respond to your voice control and voice commands, plus you can use the tablet screen to play games, browse recipes, watch movies and Prime Video trailers, control your smart home and more. The 8-inch touchscreen is small enough to stay out of the way but big enough that you won't have to squint, and the speaker is quite good for nearby music. In the mornings, Amazon's sunrise alarm feature can help ease you out of your sleep with a screen that starts getting brighter 15 minutes before your scheduled wake-up time. The camera also comes with a physical shutter for privacy.Google Assistant still makes better use of the touchscreen than Amazon -- in particular, the cooking directions and smart home controls are better -- but the Echo Show 8 is close enough, and it comes with a camera for video chats. It's really Amazon's best smart display yet, and the advent of Alexa Plus could make it even better this year.Who is this for:Amazon Alexa fans, people who want every capability on a smart display, smart home control aficionados. Who shouldn’t buy it:Those worried about Alexa privacy issues, people who don't want a camera on their display, Google Nest households.  ... Show more

Best smart display
Amazon Echo Show 15
Pros
Attractive 15-inch frame design and 1080p resolution
Physical camera shutter
Built-in Amazon Fire platform for streaming
Customizable widgets for the home screen
Cons
Widgets feels a little awkward to use
Lower quality camera and speakers compared to other Echos
Needs lots of space on a wall or counter
Why I like it:For many years, the Echo Show 10 has been Amazon's largest smart display, but in December 2021, we got the Echo Show 15. This 15.1-inch wall-mount smart display (a desk mount is also available) brings everything that you'd expect from the rest of the Echo Show lineup and allows for more screen room, better entertainment options and the flexibility to mount the screen on your wall. There's a Show 21 now, too, but in our opinion, the 15 hits a sweet spot for an extra-large smart display.Though people could access many of the best streaming services, like Prime Video and Netflix, on the Show 15 from the start, in September 2022, Amazon brought the full Fire TV interface to the smart display, making it an even better multimedia device. However, due to the device's thinness and rear-firing speakers, audio is a bit of a letdown on the Echo Show 15. But you can group speakers together to improve the audio if you have more than one Echo device.Adding another way to take advantage of the extra-large screen real estate, Amazon first introduced Widgets with the Echo Show 15. This feature lets you put small customizable interactive blocks of the things you want to see right on the home screen. I keep my shopping list, a calendar with upcoming events, my favorite smart devices and a weather widget on my device. This makes quickly glancing at information really easy, as it is all up front for me.Who is this for:People who want an extra smart TV touchscreen, fans of Amazon's video and streaming, and those looking for a master entertainment/smart home device combo. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who have no interest in Amazon streaming, people with no space for a wall mount or large desk mount, buyers who would rather just get a smart TV.  ... Show more

Best smart home control display
Amazon Echo Hub
Pros
Easy to set up
Proximity sensors help with easy hub lighting
Customizable home screen
Intuitive interface
Can be used as an Alexa device
Cons
Slow response time
Would like a dark mode
Camera previews only work with Ring devices
A home hub without entertainment options is a tough sell outside the Alexa ecosystem
Why I like it:The Amazon Echo Hub is a more dedicated type of smart display, using its speakers and touchscreen as an always-present control center for your wall. Remember those home security touchscreen displays you'd mount at an entryway to arm/disarm the system? It's a lot like that, but with a greatly expanded role. The 8-inch display is designed to be a central control point for managing your favorite Alexa smart devices (wall and desk mounting are options). The easy-to-navigate dashboard allows you to control individual devices or an entire room. This device has been great in my home, where my wife and children are less familiar with everything that is set up in our home. This way, there's a simple way to see what smart devices are available.In addition to being a smart home management device, it also functions as an Alexa speaker, allowing you to use voice commands to do everything else you'd expect from a typical smart speaker. The Echo Hub can even be a digital photo frame to show all your favorite memories. Thanks to sensors on the device's front, as you approach it, the screen will show you smart home devices and be ready to help you out.However, there's a trade-off: You simply won't be using this hub for entertainment purposes like you would other smart displays.Who is this for:People who have a lot of compatible smart home devices and want a central display to control them. Who shouldn’t buy it:People intending to use a smart display for music, movies, videos or other entertainment purposes.  ... Show more

Best smart display for the kitchen
Amazon Echo Show 10 (3rd gen)
Pros
10-inch display better for viewing
360-degree speaker is great for sound
13-megapixel, wide-angle camera
Motorized base is silent
Physical shutters and options to turn off motion
Cons
Motion can be too twitchy and sometimes get in the way
At $250, it's Amazon's most expensive display
Note: While you can still find the Echo Show 10 in stores, it appears Amazon has discontinued it, possibly in preparation for a new Echo Show release. Why I like it:If you want a 10-inch touchscreen powered by Alexa, the third-generation Amazon Echo Show 10 is the latest and greatest in smart display technology. With a motorized base, the Echo Show 10 can follow you around the room during video calls or while you're watching video content on the device -- which gets a little awkward when it bumps into things, but is really nice for large spaces and frequent movement, like working in the kitchen. The 10.1-inch HD display looks good, and the device comes with a 13-megapixel front-facing camera, plus a physical shutter for privacy. I found it's particularly easy to glance at across the room if you've found that smaller displays just aren't big enough. Like other Shows, you can view and control compatible security cameras (which is almost all of them) in the Alexa app. Group video calling is supported for up to seven people, and Drop In lets you make a call directly to your display from anywhere with the Alexa app. Occupancy and vacancy-based routines can trigger other smart home devices when the Echo Show 10 senses someone entering or leaving the room. We think most people will still get by just fine with the Echo Show 8 for considerably less money, but if you're after Amazon's boldest smart display yet with the impressive sound to go with it, this is the way to go. That room-filling sound comes from two 1-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer to ensure that the audio from the Echo Show 10 is just as elevated as the display itself, making it the best pick if you play lots of music. Who is this for:Alexa fans who play lots of music in the home, prefer a bigger screen they can use from across the room, or do lots of video chatting. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want to save with a smaller display, people who dislike a rotating model, and those who don't use a smart display for music.  ... Show more

Other smart home displays we tested
Smart displays aren't great for full recipe walkthroughs, but they work really well for small side recipes and cooking checks. Blue ApronGoogle Nest Hub Max: The Google Nest Hub Max is an impressive combination of hardware and software, but it comes with privacy concerns. For most people, we think the original, camera-free Nest Hub is a lot closer to the smart display sweet spot.Amazon Echo Show 5: The Echo Show 5 is the cheapest of Amazon's displays, and it features most of the perks of the Show 8 with a lower resolution and smaller screen. While it features a tap-to-snooze alarm feature that makes it perfect for a bedside alarm, its sound quality isn't comparable to its bigger siblings. Amazon Echo Show (second-gen): This is a good premium counterpart to the attractive $40 entry point of the Echo Show 5, although it's a little tricky to find in stock at the moment. The second-gen Show has great sound quality and a 10-inch screen but the touchscreen just isn't as useful as similar models with Google Assistant. Lenovo Smart Display 10: Lenovo's smart display looks elegant and features the same smarts as the Nest Hub, with 10-, 8- and 7-inch screens. The 10-inch Lenovo smart display has a bamboo back that's particularly well-suited for the kitchen.Lenovo Smart Clock: This smart alarm trims out a lot of the functionality of smart displays with no camera or video ability. It's cute and tailored for your nightstand, but it's more of an upgraded alarm clock than a full smart display.
Factors to consider when buying a smart display
A smart display lets you keep up with the game while working on your hobbies. AmazonPricesSmart displays are naturally more expensive than smart speakers, but they still come at a variety of prices. Smaller displayers and speaker systems typically cost around $100. Larger, better versions are around $150. Big displays with very good sound tend to land around $200 to $250. And gigantic models like certain Echo Shows can go even higher. Find the speaker that works within your budget. Screen sizeDisplays on these devices typically range from around 7 inches to 10 inches, plus Echo Shows that go to 15 inches and beyond for more TV-like displays, often mounted on walls. The 6- to 7-inch displays we like best are close at hand, like at a desk or bedside. Walk a few steps away, and you can no longer see most of the details on them. The 10-inch style models like the Echo Show 10 and Nest Hub Max are better in larger rooms -- we can walk several steps away and still get enough detail to watch videos, etc. Cameras and privacyCameras allow for video chats. If you don't video chat with a smart display, you don't need to worry about it, although you may want to make sure the camera has a physical shutter. If you do want to video chat, look for models that have reliable cameras and the right privacy features for use (that physical shutter is again an important addition). Voice assistants and smart home compatibilityWe have options on this list that offer both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa as the voice assistant available to help with questions and smart home controls. It is important to pick the smart display that best matches what you already use. If you have an Echo device already in your home, then going with an Echo Show will seamlessly integrate into your home. But if you have a Google Home device, then you'll want a Google Assistant display. We've found Google is a bit better at searches and general questions (imagine that) while Alexa is better at quick commands, smart home controls and parsing home-related information. Siri, if Apple ever produces a smart display, is great at contextual info and providing helpful details like when asking about the weather, but doesn't read answers off the internet as well.
Smart displays can do things your phone or speaker can't: Here are our favorite options. Google NestHow and where you'll use itIf you plan to use the smart display primarily for controlling your smart home, and you use Alexa, then you'll likely want to go for the Echo Hub. But if you want more of an all-around device that will work great for watching videos, then perhaps a Google Hub Max, Echo Show 10, or Echo Show 15 would best suit your needs. Likewise, think about where you are going to use the display. A bedroom smart display that functions as an alarm clock and morning news report device doesn't need to be very large, but should have excellent brightness and light settings. A device in the kitchen may benefit from a larger screen so you can see it more clearly while working. A display on a counter that plays a lot of music and controls a big smart home should have great speakers and mics.The amount of space you have on your table or counterYou'll want to consider where you'd like to place this smart display. While something like the Echo Show 8 (2023) or Google Nest Hub (2nd gen) don't need much room, the Echo Show 10 does. But if you go with the Echo Hub or Echo Show 15, you can mount those on the wall with the included hardware to free up more space on your table or counter. How we test smart displays
An Echo Show shows a camera live view of backyard with illustrated Alexa voice command. AmazonWe set up smart displays, get them connected to Wi-Fi, and start experimenting with features ASAP. Most smart displays are easy to get going, taking around 15 minutes to set up from plug in -- especially if you already have an Alexa or Google Home account. After that, here's what we dive into. Display and camera testingIs the display sharp with a good color gradient for its size? How do videos and YouTube clips look when you play them? What details can you see across the room? How visible are timers and reminders? This is also a time to study latency when searching the internet (most smart displays take a few seconds compared to computers, but if they are especially painful that's a red flag for us). We also look at brightness adjustments and ambient brightness changes, which is important when watching in particularly dark rooms or in bright daylight. While video calls often depend on internet connections for quality, we also take a minute to test the video chat features with a call to see how the audio and video perform, how features like person tracking perform, and if there are any delays or difficulties in making calls. Audio testingWe spin up some tunes from a connected music service and/or Bluetooth and see how the audio performs. Is this a "big room, party time" sort of performance, or a "small desk, computer, bedside" kind of sound? Is it thin-sounding? Is there appreciable bass, like the bass upgrades Google has given Nest displays? Audio is used just as frequently, if not more so, than the display so audio performance is very important. Voice assistants and smart home integrationVoice assistants should also be snappy, so we expect quick responses when we test smart displays, even if we're talking from across the room. This is also the perfect time for us to link up a smart device and see how it can be controlled. We always try to use a home security camera for this part if possible, because it lets us bring up a live view and test two-way audio commands, among other compatibility testing.
Smart display FAQs
What is the point of a smart display?
For smart home users, the smart display will function as a sort of visual dashboard, showing you all your connected devices and their statuses. You can view cameras and doorbells on your smart display screen, as well as make video calls, watch online content, view recipes and ask general knowledge questions. Other fun features include books, games, puzzles and holiday easter eggs. Smart displays can also double as digital photo frames and helpful clocks and calendars.

What is the difference between a tablet and a smart display?
Admittedly, a smart display doesn't do as much as your Android tablet or iPad. You won't be able to download any apps or view every single streaming platform. It isn't portable, either. Smart displays are focused on being hubs or command centers for your smart home. It's a device you'll plant on one shelf or countertop and likely leave there for life.

Should I buy a smart display?
Well, that depends. If you're interested in smart home tech, a smart display is a helpful way to view everything you're setting up and controlling within your home. If you like making video calls, smart displays are a good way to do so without sacrificing your phone or laptop battery. If a smart home isn't really your cup of tea or if you're hesitant to put more cameras, microphones and voice assistants in your home (we wouldn't blame you), then a tablet or small laptop will meet your needs.

Recent updates
Spring 2025: We differentiated our top picks more based on our own experiences with using these displays in our homes. Also, we are considering adding another Nest display to the list in future updates. The Nest Hub Max is a solid option with good sound and a larger screen we really like. If it gets a second generation like the Nest Hub did, expect to see it added to our list.
