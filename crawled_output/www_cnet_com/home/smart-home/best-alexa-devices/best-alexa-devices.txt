Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon, has ben around for many years now, and it's the go-to option for a lot of people. It is also one of the more capable smart assistants out there, and works with a ton of smart home accessories and gadgets. In fact, there are over 200 voice commands for all sorts of things, like controlling your lights, adjusting the thermostat or seeing who's at the front door. Alexa can even assist in the kitchen with timers and measurement conversions or give your family game night a digital twist. Our Picks

Amazon Alexa device FAQs
The Alexa ecosystem has grown far beyond the traditional smart speaker format. Now, you'll find Amazon's assistant built into everything from your TV and smart thermostats to home security systems and cameras. Navigating all these options can be overwhelming if you're just starting your smart home journey. That's why we've gone through the options to find the best Alexa-compatible devices that deserve a spot in your smart home. What is the best overall Amazon Alexa smart device?CNET experts have spent years testing smart displays, smart speakers, home security cameras and systems, smart thermostats, smart plugs and smart locks. All of this diligent testing has gone into building out this list of the best Amazon Alexa and Alexa-compatible devices. After years of hands-on testing, CNET staff have determined the Amazon Echo (fourth-gen) smart speaker is the very best Amazon Alexa device overall.The fourth-gen Amazon Echo is the freshest smart speaker in years, adding real home smarts and premium sound quality. The best changes to this Echo are indeed the sound quality and home smarts, but the most obvious change is its cool spherical design. With a sleek design and improved functionality, this smart speaker can (and maybe should) be a staple in every household.Best Amazon Alexa devices of 2025

Best Alexa device overall (and best Alexa-compatible smart speaker)
Amazon Echo (fourth-gen)
Pros
Improved sound quality and powerful bass
Better smart home connectivity
Easy and quality stereo pairing
Cons
A bulky design
No revolutionary upgrades from competition
Amazon's third-gen Echo Dot with Clock was our previous favorite Alexa speaker, but since the 2020 product line, the flagship fourth-generation Echo speaker has got the nod. At $100, the spheroidal speaker is more expensive than the $50 fourth-generation Amazon Echo Dot, although the improvements in sound quality and some intriguing smart home features justify the additional cost. This smart device's shape sets Amazon's newer Echo speaker apart. Where the third-gen Echo offered a barely noticeable sound quality improvement over its predecessor, the ball-shaped fourth-gen version has noticeably better audio output, including respectable bass for a speaker in its price range. On the smart home front, the fourth-gen Echo also gets a built-in Zigbee receiver, carrying over a feature from the now-defunct Amazon Echo Plus. The Zigbee receiver lets the new Echo function as a smart home connectivity point for compatible smart lights, plugs, and other Zigbee-based accessories. That means you can use the Echo itself as a hub to play music, among other things, without the need for an additional piece of hardware to get those devices online.   ... Show more

Best Alexa-compatible home security camera
Ring Stick Up Cam Battery
Pros
Affordable
Works indoors and outside
Uses rechargeable battery
Cons
Does not support Apple HomeKit
Some features require a subscription
The Ring Stick Up Cam Battery is a great camera for a lot of reasons, but thanks to its reasonable price and tight integration with Amazon Echo devices -- it's an easy pick here. Plus, because a rechargeable battery powers it, you can place it anywhere you want -- inside or out -- and not have to worry about a power outlet. It comes with weatherproof housing, clear night vision, a 130-degree field of view, a loud siren and more. Thanks to that tight Amazon integration, if you have an Echo Show smart display, like the Echo Show 15, you can put a live view widget on the screen. You can also just ask Alexa to show the feed on the screen with a simple voice command as well.  ... Show more

Best Alexa-compatible smart display
Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd gen)
Pros
Solid sound quality, good screen resolution
Price tag makes it one of the best midrange smart displays on the market
Physical camera shutter
Cons
The interface isn't as smooth or easy to use as on Google's Nest Hubs
You can't call up YouTube videos by voice
In Amazon's Echo Show 8, you get an 8-inch screen with the best resolution of any Echo Show yet, a camera shutter and all the smarts of previous Amazon smart displays. The Echo Show 8 has a built-in Alexa speaker. That means you can use this smart display to ask your Alexa digital assistant to do your bidding, whether that be asking it to play music, relay the weather or just tell you a joke. Since it's a smart display, it also offers advanced compatibility with Alexa-enabled security cameras. Ask Alexa to "answer the front door" when someone rings your Ring Peephole Cam and you can see the live feed on your Show 8 -- and actually talk to the person, straight from the smart display.  ...

Best Alexa-compatible smart lock
August Wi-Fi Smart Lock
Pros
Small, sleek design
Built-in Wi-Fi
Cons
Expensive price
Shorter battery life
August's Wi-Fi Smart Lock is a great smart lock. It retrofits to most standard deadbolts, so you don't have to deal with a complicated installation. The built-in Wi-Fi makes it possible to access and control your smart lock remotely via the Android or iOS app without needing an August Connect module. As its spot on this list indicates, it's an Alexa-compatible device, too -- that means you can lock and unlock your door from an Alexa-enabled smart speaker using your voice.The lock also comes with an open/close sensor -- called DoorSense -- that attaches to the door in question. That way, the app not only tells you whether the door is locked or unlocked but also if the door is open or closed. That's a nice touch of functionality from such a straightforward smart lock.  ...

Best Alexa-compatible smart thermostat
Amazon Smart Thermostat
Pros
Budget-friendly
Seamless integration with Alexa app and voice commands
Responsive touchscreen interface
Cons
Doesn't work with Google Assistant or Apple HomeKit
If you don't have a C-wire, requires C-wire adapter
No remote temperature sensor
Amazon's $80 Smart Thermostat is hard to beat in terms of value, and that's at full price. For starters, the thermostat works as well with Alexa as you'd expect given that it's an Amazon product, so if you have an Echo speaker or Echo Show display, you should be in good shape to get the best value out of the device. Even for those who don't, the thermostat offers a simple, straightforward design that looks great on a wall and feels great to use, and it could even save you as much as $50 per year with its energy-saving settings.  ...

Best Alexa-compatible smart bulb
Wyze Bulb
Pros
Affordable
Many smart home integration options
Useful features like scenes, shortcuts and a vacation mode
Cons
Doesn't dim as much as some competitors
Doesn't support Siri voice controls via Apple HomeKit
Limited app functionality
Wyze is well known for its super-cheap prices, and its Wi-Fi connected smart lightbulb is no different. If you're looking for a smart light that works with voice commands, this is the best Alexa-enabled one out there. A two-pack of standard, white-light bulbs can be had for just $17, but the fully color-changing versions only cost a few bucks more at $27 for a two-pack, which is worth it even if you'll only break those colors out on rare holiday occasions. Either way, you're getting a 2-pack of Alexa-compatible bulbs that connect directly to your home internet network via Wi-Fi. Screw them in, connect via the Wyze app and you're ready to go.Colors aside, the Wyze bulbs have a great range of white light, from candlelight-like to daylight-white. Plus, despite the low price, they produce better brightness than many bulbs that sell for more.  ... Show more

Best Alexa-compatible DIY home security system
Ring Alarm Pro
Pros
Fantastic value
Reliable security features
Backup Wi-Fi, local processing and storage
Cons
Setup instructions aren't always clear
While other DIY home security systems work well with Alexa, the Ring Alarm Pro offers excellent performance with unique built-in Alexa integrations. With the higher-end Ring Protect Plus subscription, you even get Alexa's security feature -- Guard Plus -- packaged in for free. That means Alexa will listen for glass breaking or footsteps while you're away and will alert you if it hears anything fishy.Beyond its Alexa integrations, the Ring Alarm Plus offers fantastic features, like a built-in Wi-Fi 6 gateway, backup internet, local processing and storage (a first for Ring), cellular backup, professional monitoring and more. A fourteen-piece system costs $380, and subscriptions range from $4 per month to $20 per month -- the most expensive of which still undercuts some of the best competition. In short, this system is a fantastic value.  ... Show more

Best Alexa-compatible smart plug
TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini
Pros
Keeps other outlets free
Works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa
Offers plenty of scheduling and timing options
Cons
Not compatible with Apple HomeKit
The TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini is a big name for a tiny smart plug that costs about $20. A smart plug like this one connects via your Wi-Fi connection directly to a wall outlet and converts your non-smart lamps, fans and other gadgets into smart devices.Use the TP-Link app to connect and control devices -- or enlist Amazon Alexa and use voice control. Say, "Alexa, turn on the reading lamp" to get the Plug Mini smart plug to control the devices connected to it with ease.  ... Show more

Best smart home controller
Amazon Echo Hub
Pros
Affordable
Easy to setup and use
Many integrations
Doubles as a smart display
Cons
Camera live view limitations
Speakers aren't very good
There aren't many smart home controllers available for the average smart home user to pick up and start using. The ones out there tend to be pricey and require a fair bit of know-how to set up. This is partially what makes the Amazon Echo Hub such a great device. For the full price of $180, the tablet-looking product may seem pricey compared to the Fire tablets Amazon offers -- until you realize the genius simplicity of the Echo Hub.It's the software interface that makes using the Echo Hub so easy and intuitive. Amazon brought the smart home controls that are available on its smart displays to the smart home controller and made them better. With a customizable home screen, quick toggles, easy-to-understand buttons and more, the Amazon Echo Hub can do almost anything for your smart home.I do wish the speakers were better and you could put more than just Ring cameras into the live widgets, but the Echo Hub is a great central location to control your smart home. Plus, it can also act like Amazon's Echo Show smart display and Echo smart speakers, too.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing an Alexa device
PrivacyAmazon's voice assistant makes it easier to control the devices in your home, set timers and find out how long your commute to the office will take. Privacy has become an increasing concern as smart speakers and displays grow in popularity. Reports that Amazon keeps transcripts of your voice conversations, even after you've deleted the Alexa audio recordings, led to concerns over user privacy. Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, wrote a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos seeking answers about Amazon's Alexa user data and how it's stored.Amazon has since introduced the "Alexa, delete everything I said today" feature. The tech giant says it's also working on new ways for customers to delete their transcripts. For example, the Echo Show 8 comes with a built-in camera shutter, unlike earlier Echo Show devices.Amazon isn't alone in its privacy concerns. Its subsidiary Ring and other major tech companies such as Facebook and Google have faced their own privacy issues, prompting questions about data usage. Amazon and others appear to be working to win back consumer trust, but it is still an important factor to consider.Type of smart home deviceThere are literally thousands of Alexa and Alexa-compatible devices that you can buy on the market right now, from smart speakers and home security devices to smart lighting and smart thermostats. Before you make a purchase, consider how you plan to use your Alexa device so you can be sure to find the one that best suits your needs.Installation and set upAmazon makes installation seamless with the help of Alexa voice commands. Plus, many of the best Alexa and Alexa-compatible devices offer a companion app to help with installation and controlling the device. Before buying an Alexa device, consider your other smart home devices, too. It wouldn't necessarily make a ton of sense to buy an Alexa device if your smart home is already made up of an ecosystem of Google Assistant or Siri devices.PriceCost is always a factor. The good news is most of these Alexa devices are budget-friendly, ranging from $30 to $300, depending on the device. How we test Amazon Alexa devices
Hands-on testing is critical to the CNET mission. No matter what device or product we're evaluating, we'll always be transparent about the unbiased and unmatched testing standards that went into our review.Since Alexa-compatible devices are all different in type and ability, and since testing home security devices is very different from testing smart displays, there wasn't one single testing method to build this list. You can trust that our CNET experts have spent hours doing in-depth testing with each product.In general, we always test for setup and installation, design, extra features, performance and value before determining a verdict. For more information, you can explore our guide on how we test home security systems and services, and how we test home security cameras and video doorbells. Other Amazon Alexa devices we tested

Is Alexa the best voice assistant?
Today, the race is extremely close between Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. Apple's Siri is on the board but in a solid third place when it comes to reliability, knowledge and comprehension of human requests. Overall, we give the edge to Google Assistant for its superior cadence, naturalistic tone and ability to understand (and answer) questions and follow-up queries consistently. It's close enough that you can safely invest in either Google Assistant or Alexa based on other preferences like speaker style, devices and compatibility with other popular smart home products.Alexa is nearly as good as Google Assistant, so you really can't go wrong no matter which assistant you choose.
