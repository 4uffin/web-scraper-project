LED bulbs can fail early, but there are specific reasons it happens. Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images
LEDs are supposed to last for years, along with delivering lower energy use, and even smart features like connecting with Alexa. They're a major leap forward versus incandescent bulbs, but they don't always last as long as they're supposed to. At CNET, we -- like many others -- have run into LED bulbs that seem fine at first, only to start flickering and burn out within a year, leaving us (and our wallets) frustrated. So I asked manufacturers and experts what's really behind these early LED deaths. It turns out there's a reason it happens, and there are steps you can take to keep your LEDs active.Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Read more: Best Smart LightsSymynelec Light Bulb Security Camera: CNET's Best Overall

1. LED life-span ratings are a broad average, not a promise
Not all LED bulbs last the same amount of time.  Edwin Tan/Getty ImagesThe numbers you see on the box don't always work out in real life. LED bulbs do last longer but those claims about five to 10 years are estimates based on internal testing -- and companies are always looking for ways to show their bulbs in, well, the best possible light.
So if the packaging says the bulb lasts seven years, that means testing showed an average of seven years, and you don't always know the math applied to get that result. Thomas Grable, from the LEDvance product technical team, said that when LED bulb averages fall within a normal distribution chart, about 95% of the values fall within two standard deviations of the mean. That still means some LED lights will experience short lifetimes -- and as Grable points out, we're more likely to remember the lights that flicker and die right away than those that plod on.
Plus, companies may use sneakier language, like "up to seven years," which means they're probably doing serious weighting toward the very top performers in their bulb testing, making it more likely you'll see bulbs fall short.
And don't forget to check LED bulb details for how the manufacturer is defining a single day of use in these year calculations (if it says). Some companies use a more honest 6 to 8 hours of use for a single day. Others may use two to three hours of use to greatly inflate their life-span numbers.
All that said, Grable reports that incandescent bulbs have an average of about 800 hours, far shorter than the average of most LED bulbs, so you should still be getting your money's worth unless something goes wrong. That's where other factors come in.
2. LED drivers overheat and fail
Temperature plays a key role in LED life. Getty ImagesThe LED, or light-emitting diode, is very unlikely to fail, and if it does, it goes out slowly over years. Instead, it's the other electrical bits in LED bulbs that fail and cut off the bulb's light. LED bulbs use DC power, which requires a converter and drivers to switch from standard AC power in homes.
That means inside every LED bulb are tiny circuit components -- and their soldered contact points -- which are far more vulnerable than the diode itself. The Lighting Research Center of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute reports that research shows the delicate soldered points are most likely to fail in harsh conditions. Heat, in particular, can cause these components to quickly break, so installing an LED bulb in a hot corner of your home or in a deep-set socket with poor ventilation can cause the lights to go out far sooner than expected.
You can help prevent these issues by looking for LED bulbs that have weighty aluminum heat-sink materials but ultimately LED bulbs won't perform the same in high heat conditions.
3. Your home electrical power may not be 'clean'
Chris Wedel/CNETIn electrical grid terms, clean power is steady and reliable, with very accurate alternating current and few unexpected spikes in amps. But not all electricity is like that. Depending on the electrical infrastructure near your home, your power may be on the dirtier side, with tiny spikes in power, and other problems. LED bulb converters need to manage all those small discrepancies, which can quickly wear them down and cause them to overheat. If you seem to frequently lose bulbs around the home for no good reason, you could have a dirty power supply.
4. Sockets may be old or installation may be poor
An Ecosmart dimmable bulb against a wood surface. Tyler Lacoma/CNETEven if your electricity is clean, a bad installation could yield the same effects as dirty power. Old, dirty sockets won't transfer electricity as smoothly, creating burnout issues. And screwing in an LED bulb too loosely or too tightly can also create problems. Aim for a firm but gentle installation process in a clean socket for the best results.

5. Your home may have high humidity
High humidity is bad for electrical connections that bulbs use. Olga Dobrovolska/Getty ImagesHumidity teams up with heat to wear down LED electrical components even faster. If you live in a wet area with high moisture content in your indoor air, LED bulbs aren't as likely to last their full life-span. Luckily, CNET has several dehumidifier recommendations to help dry out your home.
6. LED bulbs and old dimmers don't mix
LED bulbs might not work well with older dimmer switches. TreatlifeMany LED bulbs can dim, but that doesn't mean they play well with older home dimmer switches. As LED installer Torchlight mentions, old dimmers are made to work with high-wattage incandescent bulbs. They don't really know what to do with low-wattage LEDs, which leads to burnout issues.
You can either install an LED dimmer switch or -- my preferred option -- choose a smart LED bulb with self-dimming features you can control via app rather than relying on old-fashioned dimmers.
7. Quality control issues can be a factor
LED bulb installation and manufacturing quality are key. Getty ImagesFinally, the manufacturing quality of LED bulbs will affect all the issues I've discussed above. Many manufacturers have serviceable diodes but try to save money on cheap drivers and converters (as well as sloppy assembly techniques), which is a major cause behind early failure.
When picking an LED bulb, it's best to stick with well-known, reliable brands, even if you have to pay a bit more. For smart bulbs, our testers have found some of the best results from Philips, Wiz, Govee, Nanoleaf and Cree. Best Home Security Cameras With Floodlights in 2025
