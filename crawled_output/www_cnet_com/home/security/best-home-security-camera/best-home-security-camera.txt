How we test
What to consider
Privacy
Does a brand have a good track record for privacy and security? Is it resistant to hacking? Are you looking for an option that keeps your videos off the cloud, or your camera off the internet entirely?
Indoor vs. outdoor
Where are you planning on putting a camera? Does it have the right mounting options? Does an outdoor camera have the proper weather resistance and power options? Does it use light or night vision? Do indoor cameras have the right field of view to capture the whole room?
Resolution
Is the security camera at least HD quality? If you're watching a large space, have you considered a 2K or higher cam? Does the camera have zooming features if it needs to focus on details?
Field of view
Is the field of view wide enough to capture a full room or the entire section of your property that you want to view?
Power
Does the camera have the right source of power, like battery or wired? Have you checked if you have a compatible outlet or junction box for wired cams? Have you looked for wireless cams that offer batteries that last at least a few months before recharging? Have you considered PoE or other power alternatives?
Video storage
Do you prefer local storage or cloud storage? Do you mind paying a subscription for cloud storage or are you only interested in free storage? Do you mind buying a microSD card or hub for local storage?
Wi-Fi
Does your camera position easily connect to Wi-Fi? Are you willing to move your camera or router to fix Wi-Fi connection issues? Are you interested in Wi-Fi alternatives like LTE or cellular cams?

What we updated
Our CNET editors have tested dozens of cameras over the years from brands like Arlo, Blink, Lorex, Ring, Nest and Eufy -- all to see which stand out from the crowd and add value to your living space. They have also included the best in every category you can think of, whether that be budget models, excellent wireless cameras, video doorbells or even portable security cams. There are even options for those looking for a non-subscription cam.What is the best overall home security camera?
An Arlo Pro cam mounted to a wooden wall. ArloI recommend the Arlo Pro 5S 2K Spotlight camera, packed with intelligent features, a high resolution, a spotlight and lots more. It also benefits from Arlo's homeowner-friendly app if it's your first security cam, and you can put it nearly anywhere to watch your porch, driveway, living room, entryway and more. If you want the best and don't mind paying for it, start here. Otherwise, you may be interested in my other picks below. Best home security cameras of 2025Filter by

Best overall home security camera
Arlo Pro 5S 2K Spotlight Camera
Pros
Packed with smart features
Color night vision and 12x zoom
160-degree field of view
Useful motion detection
Built-in spotlight
Strong smart home compatibility
Cons
Expensive (but not as bad as it used to be)
Needs a $5 subscription for full benefits
So many features may be overwhelming to new users
Why I like it:The best security cameras can work anywhere and adapt to any situation, based on the type of security you need -- what you want to watch over, when and how you look and how you get alerts. The Arlo Pro 5S comes so packed with features that I had trouble thinking of something it couldn’t do. The up-to-2K resolution with HDR, color night vision and digital zoom all ensure you can keep an eye on any detail, while the 160-degree field of view is astounding for a cam this size.Users have their pick of smart features too, including two-way audio and smart alerts with detection zones. Motion detection, honed by Arlo’s years of experience, can identify objects like people or packages and activate the built-in spotlight during dark conditions. With an operating temperature range down to minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, you won’t have to worry too much about weather, either.Buyer’s note: You can use this cam indoors or outdoors, and if you don’t want to rely on the battery it does come with an indoor cable (outdoor-rated cables are sold separately). The one issue for the cost-conscious is the inescapable subscription fee: The Arlo Secure plan enables so much, from full 2K streaming and cloud recording to 24/7 emergency responses, that it’s more or less necessary to get the most out of this already pricey camera. Local storage is possible, but you’ll need to buy a compatible SmartHub or Base Station, which again bumps up the cost.Who is this for:People who want to combine high-quality views with a ridiculous number of smart features.Who shouldn’t buy it:The budget-conscious looking for under-$100 steals.

Best versatile home security camera
Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam (2nd-gen)
Pros
Google's accurate AI detection (now with Gemini)
3 free hours of cloud video storage
Magnetic base for easy charging
Google Assistant and Alexa support
Cons
Needs to be wall-mounted
1080p Resolution could be higher for the price
Why I like it:You can install Google’s battery cam nearly anywhere, inside or outside, and unless conditions drop well below freezing, you don’t have to worry about the weather. That versatility isn’t easy to find in smart security cameras, and Google’s AI detection makes an excellent companion feature, able to identify people, animals, vehicles and (with a subscription) familiar faces so you get useful alerts.This 1080p Nest cam includes important security features like two-way audio and night vision with HDR. I found the design useful when you can pop the cam off the magnetic base for a quick recharge if the battery is running low. Although this is a Google Home cam through and through, it still works with Alexa if you prefer Amazon’s voice assistant.One of the biggest reasons I'm giving this Nest cam the nod is its valuable video storage package. Unlike other cameras, Google Nest provides three hours of video storage for free, so you don’t need a subscription to get those cloud video benefits. You will need to take action within three hours or lose the footage without a subscription.Who is this for:Buyers very interested in free AI detection and video storage. Who shouldn’t buy it:Those who dislike Google Home or Nest products.  ... Show more

Blink's Outdoor 4 cam is easy to mount and reliable for watching an outdoor space. CNET/Tyler Lacoma
Best all-purpose outdoor security camera
Blink Outdoor 4
8.25
/10
SCORE
Pros
Outdoor durability
Long-lasting batteries rated for two years
Blink's app is easy to use
Accurate motion detection
Two-way audio
Cons
HD resolution is too low for some users
Two-way audio is tinny-sounding
Advanced object recognition locked behind subscription
Why I like it:Blink's wireless outdoor camera isn't just a good pick for newbies; it's a great general cam for any outside purpose. I love the simple-to-use Blink app, and after testing the model for over a year, it continues to run on the same batteries (which are rated for two years) and send reliable motion detection notifications about birds, pets and kids in the backyard.The IP65-rated cam (enough weather resistance for most conditions) also includes two-way audio plus night vision, and as an Amazon company, it works very well with Alexa, allowing you to get live views through Echo Show devices and other tricks.Who is this for:Buyers looking for an affordable cam that absolutely excels at backyard safety with relatively little battery management.Who shouldn’t buy it:People with large spaces to monitor who want a higher resolution cam.

Both Eufy and Arlo offer solar panel chargers for their cameras, but it's a more affordable option with Eufy. Ry Crist/CNET
Best cellular/LTE home security camera
Eufy 4G "Starlight" Camera S230
Pros
Effective cellular support without Wi-Fi
Onboard video storage
Person recognition and detection zones
Starlight sensor for expanded night vision
Works well with solar panel
Cons
8GB of storage is pretty low for storage
Requires SIM card and data purchase
Why I like it:Home security cams get recruited for all kinds of tasks, and you may have a spot in mind that’s well away from Wi-Fi. Even the exterior of larger homes can be beyond Wi-Fi’s reach, not to mention outdoor garages and granny pods, weekend camping sites or construction sites. A PoE (power over Ethernet) cam is one solution but not without a connecting cable. This cellular security cam from Eufy is a far more versatile option, powered by a SIM card that you can buy pre-loaded with minutes for simple operation.The S230 cam comes with an extra-high IP67 rating to stay active even in extreme weather, 2K resolution and a starlight sensor to keep details high at night. The battery is rated for about three months, but if you include a compatible Eufy solar panel, you may not have to worry about battery charging for a long time. Eufy’s AI detection also helps limit alerts to those involving people (plus customizable detection zones), and if the cam is close enough, you can activate the two-way audio for communication.Finally, this go-anywhere cam doesn’t have cloud storage or a subscription. Instead, it has 8GB of onboard storage to save captured video. No fees are involved, but you will have to clear out the storage when it fills. If you don’t mind paying more for a higher-end version, I also really liked the Arlo Go 2 in CNET's head-to-head.Who is this for:People who have large properties, far-away sites to monitor or just a long driveway -- and don't mind a little wiring work. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want a wireless camera.  ... Show more

Best high-resolution camera
Lorex 4K Spotlight Indoor/Outdoor Security Camera
Pros
Included local storage for staying off the cloud
Free object detection
Customizable spotlight
High 4K resolution
Cons
Onboard storage can take extra management
Installation is more work than many of our picks
Why I like it:Is cloud video storage a sore spot for you? Many people are uncomfortable trusting companies with their home video footage, especially when data breaches keep cropping up. The brands on my list do fairly well at security, but if you’re looking for an alternative, I really appreciate Lorex's privacy-focused work. Its cameras, like this model, come with a 32GB (potentially upgradeable) microSD card to save videos locally instead of on the cloud.This indoor/outdoor 4K camera shines a customizable LED spotlight wherever you need extra illumination, letting you change the color to match different camera modes or purposes. It also comes with color night vision and built-in object detection for people, vehicles, animals and packages at no additional cost.Whether you’re searching for a high-definition 4K camera or want to stick with local storage only to avoid being part of the cloud, I recommend a Lorex cam like this as the answer. Local storage does take slightly more effort to manage, especially when the hard drives get crowded with old video footage. Lorex wired cams like these are set by default to continuously record, so that storage can fill up very fast without some settings changes, like switching to scheduled or motion-activated recordings.Who is this for:Buyers looking for big resolution without worrying about video storage or extra costs.Who shouldn’t buy it:Fans of cloud storage who don't need a high resolution for long-range monitoring anyway.  ...

Want ADT+? You better be really chummy with Nest, too. Tyler Lacoma/CNET
Best camera for motion detection
Google Nest Doorbell 2nd-gen (battery)
Pros
Free 3 hours of video storage
Excellent AI-powered alerts for packages and more
Easy installation
Alexa and Google Assistant support
Cons
Low 720p resolution
Superfluous if you already have a porch cam
Why I like it:My tests found multiple high-performing video doorbells like the Arlo 2K 2nd-gen Doorbell, but we’re recommending this Google Nest model for a specific reason. Video doorbells tend to capture more footage than most security cams: Even with AI detection, they still record everyone who comes and goes from your home and often people jogging or walking dogs along the street. That can fill up cloud storage or local storage quickly, which is why Nest’s free 3 hours of cloud storage are so useful. You can quickly view recordings and decide whether to download or let the three-hour countdown expire, saving only what you need alert by alert.I also found the Google Nest Doorbell to be easy to install and use, simple to recharge, and excellent at detecting packages as well as alerting you when those packages have been removed with great accuracy. There’s a wired version of the doorbell available, but you get more options for placement with the battery model, which is useful for conforming to any awkwardly shaped entryway. The doorbell also comes with a wedge to slant it in a specific direction if your space is tight.Google includes important security camera standbys like two-way audio and night vision for its doorbell. The resolution is pretty low for a modern security cam, not even reaching full 1080p/HD. Since doorbells tend to focus on close-at-hand action, this isn't as important as it would be for other cameras.Who is this for:Everyday users who want convenient front door and package protection.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who already have a security camera watching the front yard.  ...

TP-Link's Tapo brand is one of the most reliable budget home security options. CNET
Best budget home security camera
TP-Link Tapo Pan/Tilt C210 Camera
Pros
Very affordable at under $30 considering the features
Pan/tilt capabilities
Motion and audio detection
Dual-viewing
Local or cloud storage
Cons
No zooming
Video storage will cost extra
Why I like it:Most of my feature-packed picks are over $100, and some are well over that mark. If that’s a dealbreaker for you and your wallet, this HD Tapo camera has a much lower offer. For under $30, TP-Link offers a remarkably complete indoor security camera with pan and tilt capabilities so it can capture an entire room via app controls.Even at this low price, the C210 camera manages to include important extras like two-way audio, a built-in siren and 30-foot night vision. It also uses both motion and audio detection so you can get alerts when there’s unexpected movement or noise around the house. That makes it a great budget pick for an open floor plan, keeping watch in a playroom or baby’s room, and all sorts of other tasks. It also comes with the ability to split live viewing between two different devices at the same time, so both people can look through the camera at once.While the Tapo C210 isn’t the best pan/tilt model I've reviewed -- the Eufy S350 tops that list -- it’s certainly the most affordable and has a fantastic number of security features for the price. When it comes to video storage, you can either buy a microSD card for local storage or tap into the Tapo Care plan, which starts at a low $3.50 per month.Who is this for:People looking for an extra-cheap safety solution or security gift.Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who want advanced object recognition and resolution.  ...

Ring's battery cam is on the higher-end but offers a versatile, weather resistance option to watch kids wherever they are. CNET/Tyler Lacoma
Best portable home security camera
Ring Indoor/Outdoor Stick Up Cam Pro (Out of Stock)
Pros
Highly portable battery-based design
Rated for basic outdoor weather
Motion and privacy zones for further control
Home/Away modes to save battery life
Reasonable price
Cons
Ring Protect subscription ($5) is usually a must-have
Why I like it:Mobile wireless cameras offer one big advantage: You can move them anywhere on a whim, from a sunroom or playroom to the kitchen or living room, all depending on your plans. This Ring Stick Up Cam Pro model boosts that benefit even more by allowing you to take the cam outside to a deck or patio if you want (without worrying about leaving it out in the rain).In addition to its mobility, Ring’s 1080p Stick Up camera offers motion detection with alerts, two-way audio and the ability to customize motion or privacy zones to focus the camera on important areas. A home/away feature lets you quickly switch between modes to help save on battery life when you’re home, and if you ever find the perfect spot, the cam also comes with a wall mount.The Pro model is significantly more expensive, but it adds higher-quality video and more
settings options. Plus, I frequently see it on discount, which really helps cut the price down to manageable levels. Who is this for:Camera users who want indoor/outdoor positioning on the fly.Who shouldn’t buy it:Buyers who want a strictly outdoor cam (see below for better options).  ... Show more

Other popular home security cameras we've reviewed
Lorex/AmazonWyze Cam v2: Wyze cams have a lot to love, particularly its low prices and user-friendly interfaces, which is why models like the Cam v2 have qualified as previous top picks. Over the past several years, Wyze has encountered a string of security vulnerabilities that don’t seem to be getting any better, including a late 2023 video caching error that had users looking out of strangers’ live views. I'm putting Wyze on hold for now until it’s clear it has security issues sorted out, but if that doesn’t bother you (many brands have periods where they struggle with a vulnerability), then it could be an option for budget cams.Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Floodlight Camera: My local storage Lorex pick is an all-purpose cam, but Lorex has more role-specific options too. One version I especially liked was the floodlight camera, ideal for position over a garage or patio to get shine extra light on your property.Eufy SoloCam S230 with integrated solar panel: Going solar in the right outdoor spot can help remove battery woes. Eufy makes this sunny solution simple by combining the cam with a built-in solar panel on top. If you can position it correctly, you may not need to worry about battery life until the middle of winter.Blink Mini 2: Tiny and super easy to use, I recommend this Blink Mini 2 cam as a good option if you have a rented room or dorm that you want to keep watch over. The small cam packs a spotlight, audio features, night vision and even has an outdoor option. It’s a potential option for anyone wanting a small, affordable camera… although a subscription is necessary to get some important benefits.TP-Link Tapo MagCam: When I tested the Tap MagCam, I was impressed with its resolution and outdoor durability. However, it's a heavy cam and the adhesive wall mount option wasn't an effective method of mounting for me, which made me hesitate to recommend it as an outdoor cam in lieu of other options like Blink's Outdoor cams. I also liked Blink's app more than Tapos. With a screw-in magnetic mount, this cam could be a viable option for monitoring long driveways or backyard properties. How I test home security cameras
Security cameras work best in the right spots, and cause major issues in the wrong areas. ArloHands-on testing is core to my evaluation of any home security products. When it comes to security cameras, I start by identifying new and test-worthy products from established manufacturers -- cameras you'd be most likely to come across when shopping online or at your local hardware or electronics stores. When these products hit the market, or sometimes even earlier, I get my hands on them and thoroughly test them in a real-home environment over the course of a week. SetupI begin testing by setting the camera up according to the included and/or app instructions, making note of any difficulties encountered along the way. Once the camera is ready to roll, I evaluate all features, paying close attention to resolution, night vision, notification latency, local or cloud storage and compatibility with smart home ecosystems like Google, Alexa and Apple HomeKit.
The Blink Outdoor 4 has an adjustable mount that's sturdy enough to stay at the right angle. CNET/Tyler Lacoma Feature testing
Such evaluations can take less than a day, but I monitor the camera over several days to a full week for a more complete look at the camera's performance day and night. If general use doesn't give me all the data I need, I create a mock situation -- like staging a porch pirate scenario where someone leaves a package and then someone else quickly grabs it -- to see how quickly and accurately the camera and app send notifications and record the event. When possible, I leave cameras up and outdoors for months to take a look at their battery and climate performance. My area gets plenty of cold temperatures and blazing summers alike, so it's an easy way to see what outdoor cams can stand.If you want to read more about CNET's review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security cameras and video doorbells.
Factors to consider when choosing a home security camera
CNET has tested tons of home security cameras over the years, and can help you find the right one for your needs. Chris Monroe/CNETThere are hundreds of home security cameras on the market, ranging drastically in price, functionality and quality. With all the options, it can be hard to not become overwhelmed fast, especially when you're considering something as important as your home's safety. After CNET's years of testing home security cameras, I have some tips if you're on the hunt for a new one. Here are a few parameters to consider:PrivacyThis is a big one. You don't want anyone peeping on your property or hacking into your camera. Wireless home security cameras can be more susceptible to hacking due to their connectivity to Wi-Fi networks and remote access, especially if you have poor router security. Wired home security cameras that don't use Wi-Fi at all are generally more secure. (Read more about the pros and cons of wired vs. wireless systems here.) As I mentioned above, data breaches and security vulnerabilities can also be dangerous for your privacy, so it's important to consider a company's recent reputation.Indoor vs. outdoorOne of the first things you'll need to consider is where you want to place your home security cameras. If you want your camera to be located outside, recording your porch or yard, you'll likely want an outdoor camera that's also weather-resistant or features night vision. While many cameras can be used interchangeably for indoor or outdoor purposes, some cameras are solely made for indoor usage, so make sure you're buying cameras that can handle the outdoor elements.
David Anders/CNETVideo resolutionVideo quality should be a major consideration when buying a home security camera. In simplest terms, your camera won't be effective if the only footage being recorded is grainy and unreadable. The higher the resolution, the better the video quality. Most home security cameras on the market now have 1,080p resolution, but others
have 2K resolution (like the Arlo Pro 4) or 1,536x1,536-pixel resolution (like the Arlo Video Doorbell), and a growing number have embraced 4K. Just remember, the higher the video quality, the more bandwidth it takes up and the more likely your camera is to experience lag times or glitches. Field of viewField of view (usually provided diagonally) refers to how broad the camera's view is. Broader is generally better because it captures more space and makes it easier to spot activity. The average security camera tends to top out around 130 degrees, although some go beyond that. Pan and tilt features make the field of view less important since the camera can move around.I find a broad field of view is great if you want to survey multiple corners of a backyard -- less important if you just want to keep eyes on packages and guests right in front of your door.Battery or wired powerBattery and wireless cameras versus wired options are a matter of taste since both types have pros and cons. Wireless options are usually easier to install and operate, and often use cloud storage, so you can access your footage from anywhere. Wireless security cameras have their own power supply, so even during an internet or power outage, they can still record and save footage. One of the biggest disadvantages is that you'll need to manually change the batteries or charge them every so often unless you get a solar-powered home security camera.Wired cameras are hardwired to a steady connection, so they don't need to be recharged and can often boost a high-quality video resolution. They tend to be more reliable, secure and consistent in video quality while not requiring monthly cloud storage fees. However, not all owners will feel comfortable wiring in a camera without a pro's help, and they're not great options for renters and people living in apartments.
Some Wired home security cameras (like the Google Nest Cam Indoor) typically have better video and audio quality.  Molly Price/CNETLocal vs. cloud storageNot all video storage is equal. You have two main options and picking one is up to your personal preference. There's cloud storage, which sends your video footage to a remote server to be saved, and local storage, which relies on a separate accessory or piece of hardware, usually a microSD card, to hold any footage you'd like to save. Usually, cloud storage requires a monthly fee of around $5 to $10.Wi-Fi quality and rangeWhen you're installing wireless home security cameras, keep in mind that the smart home camera you buy (and your security system as a whole) will only be as good as the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at the location where you plan to install it. So check your Wi-Fi speed before you drill holes in the walls or otherwise mess up your door frame, brick or siding for your home security camera. If the connection is spotty on your wireless security camera, you'll notice significant lag times, pixelation in the live feed and other Wi-Fi delays. These make the video quality poor and home security cameras a pain to use. With a good Wi-Fi connection, you should be in good shape to use your indoor home security camera or outdoor home security camera without any major camera system issues and get clear footage every time. Still have questions? Take a look at my home security camera buying guide and the below FAQs.
How do you place and install a home security camera?
Getty Images/Amy Kim/CNETHome security cams can be either shelf/table models, wall/ceiling mounts or a combination of both. Cams that offer both options are common, but some are made only for wall mounts. The best cameras tend to stay away from adhesives that can fade over time. Instead, they use a few simple screws to attach a base plate to wooden trim or posts: Brick, stone, fiber cement and other materials tend to make poor cam placement options without extra work. My guide on placing security cams has more info on where they are best used. What we updated
LorexWhile several picks on the list are suitable outdoor cameras, I wanted to include a more dedicated outdoor pick that would be the best option for a backyard or play space that someone wants to keep a casual eye on. The Blink Outdoor 4 has weathered both my freezing, snowy winters and heated summers, so I knew it offers durability and reliable monitoring with an excellent DIY app. I'm also considering if the Arlo Essential Gen 2 cam has a place on the list, since it has many of the features of my top pick but a much lower price.
Home security camera FAQs
What should you look for when buying a home security camera?
Choosing a home security camera can be overwhelming, with options ranging from professional systems like ADT and Vivint to standalone DIY devices like Blink and Arlo cameras, sensors and locks. The first decision you'll need to make is whether you're looking for a professionally installed system or a DIY security system. The next decision you'll have to make involves the device's specs and features. Do you want live streaming? Is two-way talk a priority? What about night vision? Modern home security cameras are loaded with neat extra features: motion detection, professional monitoring, push notifications, cloud video storage, weather resistance, sound and motion alerts and integration with third-party devices. Narrowing down which smarts you want your device to have will help you make a final decision.
Can a security camera record sound?
I get this question frequently, and the answer is complicated. Many security cameras come with an option to record sound along with video by default, as well as a way to turn it off. Some few disable this feature altogether. The reason is that laws about recording sound (like conversations) vary from state to state and country to country. Most wiretapping laws also affect home devices, often requiring you to have two-party consent before legally recording. That makes this a very gray area, especially if you want to use footage as evidence. You can always use live two-way audio without recording to avoid legal issues.
Do security cams work with existing security systems?
Some do, but you’ll have to check the specifics. Look up your current security system and see if any other brands or cameras are compatible with your app, panel and hub. For example, Vivint has a “Works with Vivint” page that discusses how you can use Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Philips Hue devices (among others) with the Vivint platform. Don’t assume that a device will work with your security system. Always get the details first, and call support if necessary.
Is the Matter standard important for security cams?
Matter is a compatibility and security protocol, offering a key upgrade for smart homes by addressing long-standing issues with data security and platform support.Matter’s not a high priority for home security cameras right now, because Matter doesn’t currently support video or smart video devices. The standard receives regular updates to support new devices, and once Matter includes security cameras -- an ongoing but delayed effort -- it will become an even more significant factor for smart homes.
Can wireless home security cameras work without Wi-Fi?
Many wireless cameras cannot fully function without an internet connection. Some cameras -- especially those that are part of a larger home security system -- use alternative radio protocols to transfer information. Those cameras will require a separate hub. Other cameras with local storage can continue recording and saving footage -- such as on a microSD card -- even during an internet outage. Lorex is one of the best brands for avoiding the internet altogether, but it'll take some work.
Can a home security camera be hacked?
Cameras can really strengthen your home's security, but they can also degrade its privacy. We don't recommend any cameras that have had recent and serious problems with data breaches for that reason. But as we explain, direct hacking isn't really a concern. There's no need for burglars to hack security cameras, and malware is more likely to infect webcams if it starts causing problems. In reality, your cameras are more likely to be compromised by a monitoring center employee ignoring the law or an ex with access to your login credentials than by a shadowy cybercriminal.Will you be able to tell if a security camera is actively recording you? That also depends. Most security cameras will include a small light that will turn on when recording, though that may not be a reliable indicator if the camera has been hacked. Others, like Arlo's indoor camera, include design features that make it totally clear when the camera is watching and when it's not. In general, if you're worried about maintaining your privacy, devices with physical shields are always a solid option.
How much should you spend on home security cameras?
Home security cameras can vary widely in price, ranging anywhere from $30 to thousands for a multi-cam system. Specific prices depends on the services, model, features or video storage you want for your camera. Home security cameras don't have to be expensive, though. All of the best home security cameras CNET tested fall between the range of $25 and around $250. I'd suggest budgeting around $100 if possible, but my budget camera picks still do a lot with what they cost. Just keep in mind that many cams require a monthly subscription to unlock important features, so note if there are ongoing costs.
