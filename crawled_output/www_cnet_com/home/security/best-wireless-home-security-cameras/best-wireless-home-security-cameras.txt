A home security camera is a smart investment, especially with the holiday shopping season approaching. It can help protect you from rising package theft and even deter a potential home invasion while you’re away. Plus, a wireless battery camera is easy to install and can be placed almost anywhere. The batteries are long-lasting and can sometimes be powered with solar panels. That's why we tested many cameras to find which ones are worth buying. Our Picks

Best overall wireless home security camera
Know how much you should pay for a camera to save when you make your purchase. ArloWe've tested dozens of battery-powered cam models, and our experts have chosen the feature-rich Arlo Pro 5S as the best wireless security camera. Arlo’s Pro 5S packs all the smart capabilities you could want into one device, plus excellent voice assistant compatibility, the well-designed Arlo app and the option to expand capabilities with an Arlo hub. It’s an easy choice if you’re willing to pay a bit more for a compact wireless device packed with the latest smart features.While the Arlo Pro 5S is pricey, you don't have to spend a lot to get a great security camera. For those on a budget, we've included a range of affordable wireless options we've tested that provide solid home protection. Our list includes options that have extra-long battery life, along with some that are portable (although there are some spots you'll want to avoid). We also have guides for the most affordable security cameras, the best solar-powered wireless cams and outdoor models built for any weather.Best wireless home security cameras of 2025

Arlo Pro 5S 2K Security Camera
Pros
Strong battery life with low-power mode
12x zoom and night vision
Spotlight
2K resolution
Broad smart home support
Video storage local or cloud
Cons
No Apple support without adding a hub
On the expensive side
Why I like it:The Arlo Pro 5S 2K-resolution camera brings more to the table than any wireless cam we’ve seen so far, including a battery rated for a very healthy six months and low power settings (enhanced by an optional Arlo system connection) to extend that to six months.This camera offers as many features as possible to give users choices, including extra functionality like 12x zoom and color night vision. Smart home compatibility is some of the best we’ve seen with support for Alexa, Google Home, Samsung and IFTTT settings, plus Apple support if you're willing to add a Base Station. You can also use the built-in spotlight and siren to ward away intruders if you feel uncomfortable, or tap into the two-way audio to have a conversation.Finally, the Arlo Pro 5S also offers a subscription service with tiers for cloud storage and professional monitoring. You can choose to buy a hub device like Arlo SmartHub and connect local storage if you prefer to stay off a plan. However, the latest Arlo plan includes handy tricks, including the ability to recognize fires and listen for specific sounds like dogs barking.Who is this for:Buyers who want everything in one cam and don't mind considering a subscription fee or add-on -- especially Apple users.Who shouldn’t buy it:Those looking for the cheapest cam, fans of simple apps and feature sets.  ...

Best wireless home security camera for battery life
Blink Outdoor 4
Pros
Long two-year battery life
Included hub for storage
Motion detection with zone control
Two-way audio
Night vision
Cons
Limited to Alexa support
Why I like it:If you’re hesitant to get a wireless security camera because of the battery requirements, you have a couple of solutions. One is a solar panel, which we’ll discuss below, but another option is finding a camera with excellent battery life so you don’t have to worry about it for extended periods. While battery life does depend on how often cameras are activated, the Blink Outdoor 4 can last up to two years in the right conditions before needing a recharge with its lithium AA batteries. That battery life seems accurate, too -- ours has been operating for over a year and the battery life is still going strong.Other important staples on the Outdoor 4 include two-way audio, infrared night vision and motion zone control. We especially like that it comes with a Sync Module 2 for Wi-Fi connections and local storage, so you don’t have to rely on the Blink subscription unless you prefer to pay for extras. Keep in mind, like other Amazon Blink cams this model only works with Alexa, so it’s most useful if you’re already part of the Amazon ecosystem with items like an Echo Show.Who is this for:Buyers look for an all-purpose outdoor cam with amazing battery life and a simple app. Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who want more than Amazon Alexa, people who want a spotlight option.

Best wireless home security camera for object detection
Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam (2nd-gen)
Pros
Easy to install and manage
Google Assistant and Alexa support
Free 3 hours of video storage
Google AI is smart and useful
Fun magnetic base design
Cons
Shorter battery life
1080p resolution could be higher for the price
Why I like it:Google’s Nest cam (and most Nest products) are designed to be extra easy to use and install, ideal for people who want quick eyes on their important belongings with minimal work. Set up the Nest’s mount indoors or outdoors, and use the magnetic connection to snap the cam on, adjust it and take it offer easily whenever you need to recharge. That makes maintenance especially easy, which is important because of the lower battery life on this camera. In our tests, we found the design excellent if a bit bulky, and we liked the floodlight option too if you don't mind wiring in another component.The HD cam included night vision and two-way audio, plus Google’s video storage package which includes up to 3 hours of cloud storage for free, a welcome deal only offered by a few brands these days. It also works with both Alexa and Google Assistant, so you don’t need to be heavily invested in Google products to get a lot out of this cam.Who is this for:Fans of Google Home and free AI object detection, people who like magnetic mounts for angle adjustment.Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who don't like cloud video, people looking for a very lightweight cam.

You don't have to hard-wire the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera. Arlo
Best floodlight wireless home security camera
Arlo Pro 3 With Floodlight
Pros
Powerful floodlight
2K resolution
Apple Home compatibility with hub purchase
160-degree viewing angle
Optional magnetic charging cable
Cons
Floodlight can drain battery fast, sometimes in just a few days
Why I like it:A floodlight camera is ideal for illuminating darker parts of your yard or driveway, but those tend to be spots where electrical wiring doesn’t reach, so a battery camera can work very well. We found this Arlo model filled with impressive features including 2K resolution and color night vision. Like our top Arlo pick, it's of the few security cams that works with Apple Home, although you will need to purchase an additional SmartHub. It also has an extra-wide viewing angle of 160 degrees, making these cams good for viewing broad spaces.While you can change some settings for motion detection, object recognition and similar features, remember that the floodlight will usually trigger movement. With a floodlight rated up to 2,000 lumens, that can be a serious drain on battery life and we’ve seen users complain that their batteries only last a few days. If this is a problem for you, the cam does come with a magnetic charging cable that’s suited for outdoor use, so you can rig up a wired alternative or spring for a solar panel connection, so you still have options.Who is this for:Users who want bright floodlights in a very specific spot. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who aren't fans of charging batteries for a wireless camera.  ... Show more

Want ADT+? You better be really chummy with Nest, too. Tyler Lacoma/CNET
Best doorbell wireless home security camera
Google Nest Doorbell Battery (2nd-gen)
Pros
Free cloud storage for 3 hours
Two-way audio
Google's AI object detection works well
Easy placement with the battery model
Cons
Battery life is a little short at several months
130-degree Field of view may be limited for large front yards
Why I like it:While Google’s Nest Doorbell does come with a wired version, we prefer the battery model. In our testing, we found it easier to install to get just the right view from your front door, and the battery easily lasts at least a few months even with regular activations. Plus, that same Nest deal for 3 free hours of cloud storage is hard to beat in a video doorbell.Features like two-way audio are even more important on a doorbell, and Google also uses some of its AI expertise to help identify packages, people and vehicles with other options locked behind the subscription. Plus, you get a few color options to better match your door and trim. If you don’t mind using the Google Home app to control the device, this is one of the best video doorbells we’ve found as a wireless model.Who is this for:People who want to stop porch pirates without paying subscription fees, fans of familiar face technology. Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who want Apple compatibility, people more interested in backyard or garage cams instead.  ... Show more

Arlo's Essential series is a great budget option for those who still want as many features as they can get. Arlo
Best budget wireless home security camera
Arlo Essential Cam (2nd-gen)
Pros
Amazing features for a cam often under $100
2K resolution
Durable outdoor design
Built-in spotlight
Color night vision
Good smart home support
Great solar options
Cons
An $8 Arlo subscription will raise that low price
Why I like it:Not all of Arlo’s cams are as pricey as our top pick: This second-gen, 2K-resolution Essential model is one of the most affordable on our list, and if you wait until a holiday sale you can save even more. In our tests we found the weighty model well-suited for all kinds of outdoor weather, with the same smooth design and user-friendly Arlo app experience as its other cams. Battery life is a little low with all those features but in our testing it still lasts several months before running out and is rated for over a year with minimal use.You also get all the valuable Arlo features like two-way audio, color night vision and solid smart home compatibility. There’s even a built-in spotlight for dark conditions. If you don’t want to worry about battery life, this is also one of our favorite cameras to pair with a solar panel, a bundle you can easily pick while still keeping the price reasonable. Just keep in mind how much Arlo cams benefit from an $8 subscription, which will add to the cost.Who is this for:Fans of cheaper wireless cams that still have a little of everything. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who would rather trade wireless features and fees for saving the most money possible.  ... Show more

Ring's battery cam is on the higher-end but offers a versatile, weather resistance option to watch kids wherever they are. CNET/Tyler Lacoma
Best portable wireless home security camera
Ring Stick Up Cam Pro (Update: Currently Unavailable)
Pros
Versatile placement options
Battery life performs well
Great distance-related motion detection features
High-quality two-way audio
Cons
Expensive for an HD cam at over $150 without discounts
Video storage requires $5 subscription
Why I like it:With both mounting and table-stand options, you can take the Ring Stick Up Cam anywhere so it makes the most use of its wireless capabilities. You can move it from watching a child sleep to checking on the living room to monitoring an outdoor deck space where kids (or adults) are playing. (You get the idea.) Or find the perfect spot and mount it for a permanent HD view supported by HDR and color night vision, which our tests find all worked well.While the Stick Up Cam Pro performs well inside or out, its features are most effective outdoors. These include 3D motion tracking with a “Bird’s Eye” view that can track where people move around your yard. Two-way audio is also included, but you’ll need a Ring Protect plan if you want video storage. If you’re put off by the Pro’s fairly high price, a standard Ring Stick Up cam is available for significantly less.Note that Ring last year changed its policy regarding police requests for user footage, limiting law enforcement to only emergency life-or-death requests for video instead of more casual orders. That’s a bit of welcome privacy compared to its previous stance.Who is this for:People who want to move a security cam with them, fans of great night vision with larger backyards.Who shouldn’t buy it:Those uninterested in subscriptions or those who want more smart home options than than Alexa.  ...

Other wireless cams we tested
Wyze Cam Outdoor v2: Wyze cameras have a lot going for them, including affordability and strong feature sets, which is why we've picked them in several of our lists before. Wyze is currently facing repeated security breaches and vulnerabilities, including a 2024 incident that let 13,000 people see through strangers' cams (a similar incident also happened in late 2023). Until Wyze gets a handle on its security leaks, we can't recommend it as a brand.Arlo Pro 4: The Arlo Pro 4 remains an excellent choice for a security camera. The Arlo Pro 5S nudged it off the list for us, but you may be able to save some money with the Arlo Pro 4 and still have many of the same features.Ring Stick Up Cam: While this cam is more affordable, we ultimately prefer the better features on the Pro model instead.SimpliSafe Outdoor Camera Series 2: This is a great camera -- if you use a SimpliSafe system and are willing to pay for a more advanced subscription so you get all the AI goodies. But it's not a standalone camera, and so ultimately not a good fit for this list.Reolink Argus Eco plus solar panel: While we did choose this Reolink cam as an affordable option for solar-powered wireless cameras, we prefer the much easier installation of Arlo's solar cam.TP-Link Tapo C420S1: This powerful 2K camera is affordable and benefits from Tapo's user-friendly features, including local video storage. It didn't quite make our list -- we found better budget options, and the design of this camera is a bit awkward for mounting -- but it's still worth a look. Factors to consider when choosing a wireless security camera
This Arlo Pro 5-camera system includes wall mounting and screws, rechargable batteries and a base station with built-in siren. It's expected to be available at a 38% discount now through July 16 at 11:59PM Pacific. Arlo via AmazonDoes it work with smart home platforms? If so, do the smart features work well together? Nowadays, home security cameras are expected to work with at least one major smart home platform. Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple HomeKit are the main ones you need to look for. Apple Home app support is usually the hardest to find. How's the live view? Wireless security cameras and video doorbells are often exposed to direct sunlight, weather and other natural elements, but many others are installed under porches, near shady trees and in all sorts of other settings. The camera must have crisp, clear video footage or even night vision so you don't get stuck with grainy and unusable footage. InstallationWireless camera installation is typically with a screwed-in mount. Some use adhesive, but that works best in mild weather and smoother surfaces, which are often in short supply outdoors, so take that option with a grain of salt. Don't drill into anything that you want to keep safe from moisture unless you're willing to carefully caulk the edges of the cam, too.Local vs. cloud storageNot all video storage is equal. You have two main options and picking one is up to your personal preference. There's cloud storage, which sends your video footage to a remote server to be saved, and local storage, which relies on a separate accessory or piece of hardware, usually a microSD card, to hold any footage you'd like to save. Usually, cloud storage requires a monthly fee, and companies typically reserve the right to share that footage with others in case of emergencies, such as an FBI search. But it's very easy to manage and you don't have to be at home to change it. Local storage is cheaper but more limited by how much a storage card can hold, and may not have the same history or analysis options of cloud data.
Tapo's solar bundle is ready for all kinds of weather.
TapoMotion detection and recognitionMotion detection is one of the most important features of DIY security cameras. You'll want a feature that automatically records video and sends you alerts when the camera picks up motion. You also don't want to get alerts and useless videos every time leaves blow by (or cars drive by, deer walk past, etc.). That's where object detection comes in useful: The best security cameras can distinguish between vehicles, animals and people. The best versions like Google's AI detection can also detect packages and, if you allow them, familiar faces at your door.Battery life and managementWireless cams live and then literally die based on their battery life. When looking for a good battery, keep in mind that ratings are subjective, and batteries will drain faster depending on how often the camera is activated. We've found that most wireless security cameras fall in line with their ratings and last several months with at least a few daily activations. Charging typically takes several hours, leaving it overnight is a great way to get a full charge.Ring's Outdoor 4 cam is a notable outlier with its extra-long battery life, and solar cams offer an alternative way of charging.No matter what battery option you pick, consider installing a wireless camera somewhere that's relatively easy to reach to bring the camera or its battery pack inside for charging. Not everyone wants to climb a ladder every time.ConnectivityMost wireless cameras need Wi-Fi to work. Some security cameras can operate on PoE or Power over Ethernet, but then they won't be wireless, so a strong Wi-Fi network is important. This usually depends on your router more than your cams, but keep in mind Wi-Fi signals need to reach across exterior walls, sometimes multiple obstacles. Our Wi-Fi works well for exterior cams at ranges of 30 to 50 feet, but your results may vary so try to be a little flexible with placement and always test Wi-Fi before you drill. Privacy and securityYou may want to look up privacy policies for the camera you are interested, and see if the brand has had any recent security issues. We look for brands that act quickly and make significant changes when they find a security issue like Eufy's security breach back in the early 2020s or how Wyze cams had multiple security flaws in just a few months. We also like to see changes like Ring removing its casual option for police to request user videos. How we test wireless security cameras
Wireless camera charging isn't complicated, but there's a few things you need to know about how it can work.  ArloHands-on testing is core to our evaluations of home security products. In short, when it comes to security cameras, we pay special attention to resolution, night vision and latency, extra features, general performance and overall value. We evaluate all of these elements in a real home environment over a week, posting up wireless cameras indoors and outside to see how they perform. Setup and detection featuresWireless camera installation is usually simple by nature, but we pay close attention to the design, weight, mounting options and general fit of the cam for at home use. That includes testing magnetic mounts, screw vs. adhesive installation and how easy it is to adjust a cam to a certain and keep it there. Video quality and night visionIn testing, we take a close look at app live views, video recordings and general clarity. Latency is also important: Most cams will take at least a few seconds to bump up to higher resolutions, but we like see as short of times as possible, and even shorter for motion detection to trigger. We'll also take a look at cam night vision in the dark, a field that has come leaps and bounds in recent years and is usually enough for any quality cam to capture nighttime details for the average yard. Battery life and weather resistanceBy testing these cameras for longer, we can get a good look at battery life over weeks. Weather resistance is harder to test, but depending on the season we can expose the camera to hot sun, rainy storms or winter snow to see how it handles everything. Smart home integrationsIf the camera has support for options like Apple Home and Google Home, we also try connections and controls from there. Since Matter support has been slow to come to cameras, this is one place we often run into bugs or features that are missing on certain platforms, so it's important to test.

Wireless security camera FAQs
Can wireless cameras work without internet?
Wireless smart cams generally rely on your home internet connection to function, but that isn't always the case. Some devices, like Nest's wireless video doorbell, can save footage locally in case of an outage. Other systems, like Lorex's cameras, work using their own wireless network. That means as long as their base station has power, the wireless cameras will keep recording onto a microSD card.
What's a good affordable wireless security camera system?
The cost of smart security cameras can add up really quickly, so if you're looking for a whole system of cameras, more affordable options from developers like Blink or Arlo may be best. Getting an affordable video doorbell might be a good idea, too, and wireless options are getting cheaper every year. Generally, wireless cameras cost more than wired and very rarely go below $50.
How do I place a wireless security camera?
Most wireless cameras use a simple screw-in mount or adhesive strips. Follow the manual’s directions carefully to prepare your mounting surface and install the base portion of the camera. When possible, avoid trying to install a camera on stone, metal, brickwork or fiber cement, as these surfaces aren’t easy to drill into and may not support a sticky adhesive (especially when temperatures change). Solid sections of trim, fence posts, eaves and other spots tend to work best in our experience.Since you’ll have to take down a wireless security camera occasionally for battery recharging or other maintenance, it’s a good idea to choose a spot that’s relatively easy to access in the future.
Is it legal to use a security camera on my property?
Respect other people’s privacy and you shouldn’t have any legal issues with a wireless security camera. Generally, that means you can’t point a camera toward someone else’s backyard where they expect privacy, or into the windows of their home. You also shouldn’t point wireless cameras so they look into your own bedrooms or other private places in your home.
How long do wireless cameras handle power outages or internet disruptions?
Wireless cameras won't need to worry about power outages because of their batteries, but that still means Wi-Fi networks will be disrupted. While some security cameras offer basic Bluetooth connections, almost all modern wireless cams need Wi-Fi for remote and app management. However, they'll usually be able to pick up motion, recognize objects and record video on their own until Wi-Fi is restored.
Recent updates
Spring 2025 update: We decided to add Arlo's Essential camera as a viable budget option, especially with its frequent discounts. Arlo cams more or less need a subscription to really take advantage of their advanced features, but it's still a worthy option for those who want low initial costs for a very, very good camera.
