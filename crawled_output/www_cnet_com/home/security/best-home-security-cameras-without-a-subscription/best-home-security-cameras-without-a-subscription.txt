Feels like everything comes with a subscription now, huh? Even many security cameras need a plan to enable cloud video storage or upgrade AI detection for packages and faces. That's annoying when you're trying to save money and simplify your life, but other options exist.

How we test security cameras
The best home security cam placement and installation
When I test cams, I always keep my eyes open for brands that perform well and give you the important features you need without requiring a monthly subscription (or at least give you good workarounds). Other CNET reviewers have done the same, and after over 200 hours testing indoor and outdoor cams, we've found our favorites that don't need fees. These cameras still offer video storage and advanced detection options so you're not missing out. What's the best subscription-free home security camera?
This Tapo cam can fit nearly anywhere and includes local storage options. TP-Link/AmazonAfter our testing, we chose the Tapo C120 Indoor/Outdoor Cam as our top choice for a one-time purchase thanks to its higher resolution and immense versatility, combined with a very affordable price.Our list also includes pan/tilt cameras, floodlight cams, models with extra-high resolution and other important features. None of them requires the $3 to $10 monthly subscriptions to enable important features like AI object recognition or video storage. You may have to buy a microSD card, but you'll never have to worry about ongoing fees and get extra data security as a bonusAfter you’re done, consider checking out our lists of the best cheap home security cameras and best wireless cams, too. What we updatedSummer/Fall 2025: I updated the Eufy pick to Eufy's latest outdoor camera the SoloCam E42, a powerhouse with a built-in solar panel and high resolution for those who want hefty security in their home or small business.
Lorex is a popular choice for buyers who want to stay off the cloud and away from subscriptions. Lorex/AmazonBest home security cameras without subscriptions

TP-Link Tapo C120 Indoor/Outdoor Cam
Pros
2K resolution
Frequently found below $30
Indoor and outdoor support
Motion zone setting
Color night vision
Google and Alexa compatibility
Cons
A wired plug-in cam like this isn't the best option for outdoor use, although it is possible
You'll have to pay for a sizable microSD card, too
Why I like it:I've chosen the versatile C120 indoor/outdoor cam as the best pick for buyers who want a little of everything -- with a fairly low initial cost, too. Tapo's blend of subscription-free features (there is a Tapo plan, but it’s far from necessary) offers person recognition and onboard video storage with the purchase of a microSD card. Another advantage of the C120 is its 2K resolution -- higher than many of TP-Link’s budget models -- and its magnetic base, which makes placement easy whether you’re using it indoors or out. Just keep in mind you’ll still need a safe outlet nearby. It also comes with color night vision and compatibility with both Alexa and Google Home/Assistant. TP-Link's app also allows for a couple of neat tricks, including digital boundary lines that act as motion zones and customizable siren/light alarms.Who is this for?Buyers who want a highly versatile camera that doesn't require fees to enable important features. Who shouldn’t buy it:Those who want a more compact design or a simpler app to use.  ... Show more

Reolink
Best outdoor security camera with no subscription
Reolink Argus Track Cam
Pros
Wireless design with included solar panel
4K resolution
Zoom and tracking
Good object recognition
Color night vision
Cons
Setup requires some extra work with the solar panel
Again, a new microSD card will add to the cost
Why I like it:Reolink’s Argus Track is designed for highly efficient outdoor use. It combines a 4K cam that can easily spot details across the yard with a solar panel you can set up to keep the battery charged on this wireless model. It’s also got pan/tilt features that can track movement, color night vision and onboard storage via a microSD card slot.Those powerful features don’t require subscriptions, making this one of the best options for a no-fee outdoor camera that can detect people, vehicles and animals. While the wireless design does make it easy to place, you may have to do more work finding the right installation spot for both the cam and its solar panel, which benefits from a sunny destination.Who is this for?People who want a top-line outdoor camera they can put anywhere with a solar panel to make battery management much easier. Who shouldn’t buy it:Those who don't want to place and install an extra solar panel, or who are looking to spend under $100.

Best indoor security camera with no subscription
Aqara Camera Hub G3
Pros
2K resolution with pan/tilt capabilities
Great free object and sound recognition
Swift setup
Broad compatibility with Google, Alexa, and Apple HomeKit
Cons
No included microSD card
Many features won't get used without adding more senors
Why I like it:I found Aqara's hub to offer smooth performance, a very clear app view of its 2K camera (1080p continuous recording), and pan/tilt functions to cover an entire room. You also get person detection and noise detection for free, and video storage via the microSD slot. Setup proved very straightforward, too, and there's even some Apple Home compatibility along with Google and Alexa (hopefully more as the Matter standard embraces security cameras more fully).This camera also has a hidden benefit with its "hub" status. It can connect to other Aqara security sensors to transform into a mini security system if you want, without needing any additional hubs, allowing for better whole-room protection and interesting home routines. That makes features like its customizable siren even more useful. Who is this for?Those looking for a crystal clear indoor pan/tilt camera that doesn't demand fees for extras like object recognition, plus the opportunity to expand into other security sensors in the future. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don't care about other home security compatibility, or who don't need a lot of AI identification features.

Best video resolution security camera with no subscription
Eufy Indoor Cam S350
Pros
4K resolution
Built-in solar panel
Pan/tilt/zoom
People/pet detection and tracking
Includes hub for local storage
Cons
Eufy's app is a bit janky
The cameras are typically only available in a two to four pack, which makes buying just one very difficult
Why I like it:Eufy has long been a reliable brand for getting important AI features like person and animal detection without the need for a subscription. Its latest 4K, pan/tilt outdoor two-pack goes another step and adds the HomeBase 3, which you can use for video storage (up to 16GB) without the need to buy a separate hub. This cam comes not only with two-way audio for talking or sounding a siren, but also a built-in solar panel. Solar panel add-ons are common for wireless cams, but Eufy has included its panel as part of the design. Find a reasonably sunny place, and the camera will be able to keep its battery charged during much of the year, saving you a step.The included HomeBase also comes with another benefit, enabling support for Google, Amazon Alexa and Apple (Apple HomeKit/Siri support is harder to find), which makes this cam a good choice for Apple fans who want some outdoor protection. Who is this for?Those looking for an extra-high-resolution pan/tilt outdoor camera that doesn't require fees to enable AI and storage, and manages its own battery life in ideal conditions.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who won't want a solar cam, users who can't stand clunky apps or additional hubs to manage.  ...

Best local storage home security camera with no subscription
Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Floodlight Security Camera
Pros
Customizable floodlights
2K resolution with HDR
Color night vision
Lorex includes a storage card with purchase
Cons
Expensive at around $250
Lorex's included microSD cards may be too small for active cams
Why I like it:If you’re looking to invest in a higher-end outdoor cam and don’t mind spending extra for a full suite of features when you know no subscriptions will be coming your way, Lorex has an excellent floodlight camera for looking over a large outdoor space. It offers 2K resolution, color night vision, two-way audio and an included 32GB microSD card. That’s a fairly complete package, even without the free person, vehicle and animal protection that’s also included -- or the support for Alexa and Google Assistant.But the biggest feature of this cam is the two LED floodlights. I like Lorex’s floodlight approach more than most: You can adjust the angles and set specific brightness and color temperature levels, as well as how easily they are activated. That’s a level of customization that is comparatively rare in home security lighting.Who is this for?People who want a customizable floodlight camera that doesn't come with monthly subscription requirements, buyers who don't want to buy an extra microSD card -- but don't mind paying more for a powerful camera.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want to save money, or who already have plenty of outdoor lighting.

Best battery-powered home security camera with no subscription
Blink Outdoor 4 with Sync Module 2
Pros
Compact and wireless
Great app controls
Long battery life rated for two years
Subscription is optional with a purchased hub
Cons
Requires a hub and flash drive for no-fee video storage
No person detection without a subscription
Why I like it:Blink does offer a subscription plan with video recording and storage, but we’re adding it as an effective option because of the Sync Module 2 -- this compact, square hub connects to the Blink Outdoor 4 and allows you to plug in a USB flash drive and use it for local storage. That largely removes the need for any subscription. You still get Blink’s motion-activated alerts and incredibly easy-to-use app, so subscription fees become very optional.Otherwise, the Blink Outdoor 4 is a common recommendation of ours because of its long two-year battery life and easy wireless setup (my batteries have lasted well over a year by now). You'll miss out on outdoor person detection, which is locked behind the subscription, but otherwise this cam deserves consideration if you don’t mind purchasing a hub to work with.Who is this for?People who want an all-purpose wireless outdoor camera with batteries that last for years, preferably with a spare USB drive handy for storage.Who shouldn’t buy it:Those who can't stand managing extra hubs, or are looking for indoor cams.  ...

Other home security cams without subscriptions that we've tested
Tyler Lacoma/CNETTP-Link Tapo C210: This is one of our favorite affordable cameras at the moment, but we prefer cameras with slightly better specs that also come with local storage, including more advanced Tapo models. Blink Mini 2: The Blink Mini 2 has a surprising amount of features for its small size and affordable price (plus outdoor compatibility), but it's a little too short range and the required Sync Module 2 for local storage greatly increases the price.Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor cam: Nest doesn't have any local storage options, and the 3 hours of video storage means you need to act quickly, so it's a complicated compromise for those who want to avoid subscriptions altogether. We went with simpler, local storage approaches for this list, but still recommend this camera for Nest fans.Google Nest Doorbell: The Nest Doorbell is an excellent device that greatly benefits from Google AI and Nest's high-quality construction. However, it doesn't have any local storage, so you'll have to stick to that 3-hour limit.Lorex 2K Indoor Pan/Tilt Camera: This Lorex cam is an excellent local storage alternative, but ultimately we chose the floodlight model for its great outdoor usability. TP-Link Tapo C310: The C310 makes a fine outdoor camera ready for a microSD card, but we found Tapo's indoor/outdoor camera a little more useful for the average person.
Factors to consider when buying a home security camera

Checking detail, up close and at a distance, is very important for live views and the quality of recorded video. It's important to pay attention not only to resolution numbers and how wide the field of view is, but whether a brand locks higher resolutions behind a subscription (some do). Video storageVideo storage refers to how easily video can be recorded and shared, typically either in the cloud or locally through an attached hub/hard drive. Cloud storage is almost always locked behind a subscription, except in rare cases like Google Nest and some others. Local storage is generally a better way to avoid subscriptions and still get this important quality-of-life feature.
Chris Monroe/CNETSmart home integrationSmart home support for voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) or platforms like Google Home or Apple Home aren't often locked behind subscriptions: What you see in the specs is what you get. That can be limited to a single platform (Amazon likes to keep its devices focused on Alexa for now) or spread out between several platforms. If you already use a voice assistant or a full smart home security system, look for a camera that's compatible with it.Object detection accuracyObject detection, like recognizing packages or human-shaped beings approaching, is another feature often locked behind a subscription. Some cameras offer free object detection. Eufy uses human detection for many of its cams, TP-Link Tapo cams offer some free detection and several Lorex cams provide package and people detection.

It's also a big bonus if they don't have constant pop-ups telling you to sign up for a subscription.Night visionWe always take a close look at night vision and its distance to make sure that it's working properly and offers plenty of utility for capturing images on the other side of your yard or room.Two-way audio Two-way audio features help scare away intruders, talk to strangers or tell the kids to get inside for dinner. They're always free, but we take a close look at their quality and range, too. Installation requirementsSecurity cameras typically have wall and/or shelf mounts depending on how you'd like to place them. Sometimes you have to order a wall or shelf mount separately, so have a good idea of how you want to place the camera first. Many wall mounts require you to drill the mount in, but some do come with adhesive mounts, which need to be placed on a smooth, clean surface or they will fail. A drill and screwdriver is usually all you need for a screw-in mount. Weather resistanceIf your camera is going to be outdoors at all, you should look for a cam that has IP ratings, preferably IP65 or higher. That indicates dust and water resistance that is sufficient for outdoor use in most cases. If it gets very hot or very cold where you live, check the operating temperature range too, before you buy.
How we test security cameras
Aqara's camera provides a highly customizable, expandable indoors security option. Tyler Lacoma/CNETOur experts follow a complete testing process that examines how all the features on a home security camera function. We walk through these features with a number of visual and audio experiments to see how cams match their claims -- and the capability of comparative models. There’s a lot that goes into this process, and you can catch plenty more details over at our guide on how we test.Setup and installationWhile we have a lot experience setting up cameras, we still pay close attention at this stage and consider if the average users would have trouble setting up the cam, connecting it, mounting it on a wall and similar steps. We look for clear instructions, multiple mounting options and designs that are easy to understand and manually adjust. This is also a great time to insert our own microSD cards and check out local storage management, since we won't be using cloud storage with these no-subscription cameras. Image qualityOur tests include live view and recording examinations of image quality compared to the stated resolution and similar resolutions from other cameras. This is also where we examine the lens and field of view, any pan/tilt features and how well the night vision functions work in dark rooms or yards, usually out to about 30 feet or more.

Screenshot by Tyler Lacoma/CNETSensor and AI testingToday's cameras come with motion and sound detection and object recognition for a variety of things, usually people and animals. We run scenarios that test out these sensors to see what alerts we get, how accurate they are and if there's any frustrating latency or delays. App UI and settingsAs we use the apps and adjust settings for the features I mentioned above, we also look for an intuitive app design that's easy to learn and gets you where you want quickly with snappy menus. Cluttered apps, confusing menus and apps with lots of advertisements get lower scores.
Security cameras benefit from adjustable lights. LorexLights, cams and actionMost security cameras have two-way audio, and many have spotlights or floodlights. We test these features in real time, adjust brightness and volume, and see how they perform. That's especially important when testing audio in outdoor weather, for example.
The best home security cam placement and installation
Solar panels are a minor installation that can save a lot of camera hassle. CNET/Tyler LacomaPlacing a home security camera is one of the hardest decisions today's DIY cameras require. Every home is different, so you'll need to customize the location to get the best angle to capture a room or yard. Sometimes central locations are best for pan/tilt cameras or a high shelf for an overview. For installation, we like the stability of a screw-in mount or the versatility of a horizontal surface. For more, take a look at our guide on the best spots to install home security cameras.
Security camera FAQs
What features are locked behind home security camera subscriptions?
That can vary from subscription to subscription, but there are expectations in common. Companies like Ring, Arlo and others lock their cloud video storage features in subscriptions, and while there are sometimes local workarounds, they’re rarely convenient or cheap. Advanced object detection is frequently accessed only through subscriptions, as are “rich” notifications and alerts that provide more detail about what’s happening. Certain video features, like extended live views, snapshot timelapses or home/away modes, can also be trapped in subscriptions.More advanced subscriptions typically expand the plan for multiple devices and may add professional home monitoring and AI detection with better alerts. Arlo, for example, unlocks customized objection detection and AI video searches at higher tiers.
How much do microSD cards cost for a security camera?
They’re getting more affordable all the time. You can find a 256GB (a massive amount of storage for a home security camera) microSD card for under $20 these days. Smaller cards will cost significantly less, around $10 or less, but you may have to delete videos more often with them.
Do cameras offer free cloud video storage?
If you like keeping and accessing your video in the cloud, you’ll probably have to pay a subscription. Free cloud storage does exist, but it’s hard to find. Google’s Nest cams offer free video storage for 3 hours, but you’ll need to act within that timeframe to save the video, so you’ll need to check alerts fast. Currently, we don't know of any other cameras that have free video storage like this, but most will offer a monthly trial of their cloud services so you can see how they work.
How fast does local video storage fill up for a security camera?
That depends how often and long it records. A 32GB card like the one Lorex provides in some cams can record for a few hours at 1080p, much less at higher resolutions. Upgrading to a larger card means you don’t have to worry about deleting videos as often. Keep in mind, cameras only record video on activation, usually by motion detection, so you can manage activation by adjusting your motion sensitivity if you want to cut down on the number of videos that get uploaded.
What is NAS?
NAS stands for network-attached storage and is often used in conjunction with NVR, or network video recorder. An NVR is similar to a DVR, except it records footage from your cams. NAS storage like this is typically used for large security systems with an array of cams that record a lot of footage and need a central database to store and view it. An NVR isn’t necessary for the average home security system with local storage. Some may consider it for off-the-grid security or security systems that never need to connect to the internet.
What are the best security cameras without a subscription?
Look at our recommendations to see picks from brands known for nonsubscription cameras. Top brands include Tapo, Reolink, Lorex and Eufy, which all focus on on-board storage options (although many do have cloud subscriptions if you change your mind).
What's the difference between cloud storage and local storage for security cameras?
Cloud storage loads videos up to servers managed by security companies. That generally makes it easier to manage and sort videos, take advantage of AI video searches and upload as many clips as you want without worrying about storage limits. It also makes it easier to download and share videos as needed. But you have to pay a monthly fee, usually $3 to $10. Local storage is more private and doesn't require fees, but you need to buy a separate hub or microSD card, and you'll have to occasionally delete videos or arrange settings so videos auto-delete after a certain time.
Can I access my security camera remotely without a subscription?
Yes. Nonsubscription cameras still connect to Wi-Fi and enable remote control without a subscription. It's very rare for any brand to lock live views and basic alerts behind a subscription.
Do subscription-free cameras have person/package detection?
That varies, but they usually do and all our picks have basic AI detection like this. However, it's not usually as comprehensive or accurate as the type of detection that you get with a subscription service. Some detection, like facial recognition, is always locked behind a paywall.
