Setting up your home security can seem like a daunting task, but it's quite simple. You can get started with a video doorbell, which will keep an eye on your main entry point to the home, letting you track any interactions happening in the area. If all the pressure from tariffs is getting to you and you're rushing to grab one, you're not alone. A recent CNET survey found that one in 10 US adults is looking at making a tech purchase before the tariff pricing hits. If that's you, and you want to choose right, you can't really go wrong with Ring -- one of the biggest names in home security thanks to its extensive selection of security cameras and doorbells.

Placement and installation for video doorbell cameras
Ring's portfolio has grown considerably over the years, and it now offers many more options. We've been testing and reviewing every member of the ever-growing list of the latest doorbell products from Ring, keeping an eye on all the upgrades and differences between models. To help you choose, we've put together this roundup of home-tested Ring products, featuring some affordable choices as well as a few options for those living in apartments.What is the best Ring video doorbell? Our current top pick for the best Ring doorbell is the Ring Battery Doorbell Pro, offering bird's eye views, custom motion zones and a solid battery life via a removable battery pack. If you want to stick with your existing doorbell wiring and say goodbye to battery-powered doorbells, don’t worry -- Ring has you covered there, too. Whether you want to get a Ring video doorbell for your own home or as a tech holiday gift for a new homeowner or renter, you'll find an option below. And while you're at it, take a look at our best video doorbell list and best outdoor cam guide to check out other brands like Nest and Arlo in addition to Ring.Note: Ring has come under criticism for its privacy policies in the past. As a result, the company has now removed an option that allowed police to request video footage from the company for any reason. It's a privacy improvement that makes Ring's policy more similar to Google and other security companies. Best Ring video doorbells of 2025

SCORE
Pros
Very large field of view
HD+ resolution
Color night vision
Advanced motion detection
Quick replies
Battery or wired
Cons
Expensive
Bulkier than comparative doorbells
Battery case could be sturdier
The latest Ring doorbell also has some of its best features, including a particularly large field of view and built-in options to manually charge the slip-out battery or connect the doorbell to a constant source of power. The motion detection is backed by the best Ring video features too, including 3D detection and Bird’s Eye Views that, when set, provide tracked paths that moving objects took while in view. It also has extra features like Quick Replies you can set for premade instructions as well and standards like two-way audio and night vision (in color for this model).The resolution is also an interesting upgrade that only the latest Ring doorbells have, offering “HD+” 1536p video for a bit of extra detail. The traditional Ring caveats still apply: Smart home compatibility is primarily limited to Alexa, and object recognition or video storage will require a Ring Protect plan. Our review also found that the doorbell is a bit bulkier and lacking some of the compact durability of similar models like the Google Nest doorbell. But in all, this large, powerful cam is Ring’s best option, especially for those looking for excellent video that captures a broad area in the front of their home.  ... Show more

This older Ring doorbell combines affordability with a nice array of features. Like our top pick, it can be used either as a battery model or wired into existing doorbell power depending on your placement. The HD video is very competent with a field of view that’s great for a doorbell without reaching the broad angles of our top pick.Once again, object detection and video storage are supported with a Ring Protect plan, and quick reply options are included if you’d rather not use the two-way audio at all. It’s a great middle-of-the-road pick for a Ring doorbell with a price low enough to help those looking to save money.  ... Show more

Best well-rounded Ring video doorbell
Ring Battery Doorbell Plus
Pros
Useful balance of features and price
Great field of view
Cons
Construction still feels a little flimsy compared to competitors
The Plus model is an effective combination between the expensive new Battery Pro and the older, more affordable second-gen Video Doorbell. It includes the high-end features like HD+ resolution and an extra large field of view while keeping the price low by cutting features like the Bird’s Eye view. The result is a very well-rounded video doorbell for people who want something more than a budget model but don’t want to spend too much.  ... Show more

Wired only
Those looking for a cheap video doorbell that will save them money -- while offering all the benefits of a Ring Protect plan and similar features -- can’t do much better than this wired model. It still includes all the important basics like night vision, two-way audio and a healthy field of view. However, you will need to place it where your existing doorbell is, which can limit some of your options.  ... Show more

Best Ring video doorbell for apartments
Ring Peephole Cam
Pros
Perfect for apartments without doorbells
Battery power makes for easy installation
Two-way audio
Field of view similar to doorbells
Knock sensor
Cons
Made mostly for doors that have peepholes
Subscription still locks some important features
You don’t need to live in an apartment to use the Ring Peephole Cam, but it’s specially designed for people in apartments or those who don’t have room for a doorbell. It really can act as a digital doorway peephole in the traditional sense, but the real value comes from all the video doorbell features you get in such a compact package. Those features include a surprisingly large field of view for such a small device, two-way audio communication and motion detection with adjustable motion zones. The HD cam is battery powered with Ring’s quick-release battery, which makes installation especially easy. There’s even a feature that detects knocks if you’re not at home to hear them.  ...

Factors to consider when choosing a Ring video doorbell
Ring's motion zones help increase accuracy, among other benefits. CNET/Tyler LacomaWhen you're looking for a video doorbell, the most important question isn't "Which one is best?" so much as "Which one is best for me?" All of Ring's video doorbells perform well -- and all of them come from the same company, with the same troubling history of facilitating video sharing with police. Not all of them will be ideal for you. Important FeaturesVideo doorbells should have key features like night vision, two-way audio and motion detection. Those are more or vital parts of this type of security camera. Then several other features are also very important for doorbell management, including object detection to spot alerts about packages, and video storage so you can keep the recorded clips rather than just relying on live views.Does it work with smart home platforms? If so, do the smart features work well together? Amazon’s Ring is an Alexa-focused brand, which is great for those who have Echos or Echo Shows that let them look through the doorbells’ live views. However, you won’t have other smart home compatibility here outside of Alexa apps or devices.LatencyLatency is particularly important for video doorbells because you want the doorbell to detect movement quickly and alert you in a timely way so you can check the door or retrieve a package ASAP. Object recognition is good, but it can often slow down reaction times for the doorbell. Speedy recording and alerts are important for overall quality of life.Quality of the live view? Doorbells are often exposed to direct sunlight, but many others are installed under porches, near shady trees and in all sorts of other settings. It's important that the camera has night vision and can handle any of these scenarios so you don't get stuck with a nonfunctioning product that can't see faces under a porch.  How we test Ring video doorbells
Have an apartment? Ring's Peephole model still allows you to protect your front door. RingTesting to determine the best of the best in video doorbells is similar to how we test any other home security camera. For this article, we went through setup, installation and performance of multiple Ring video doorbell models. That included plenty of experiments to see how motion detection and object recognition work, as well as evening tests to experiment with the night vision features. We also put features like two-way audio to the test to check on clarity, and review video clips to see how storage and retrieval work, among other factors.
Placement and installation for video doorbell cameras
Unlike other home security cameras, placement for video doorbells is very limited. You can place it where your previous doorbell was or pick a side of your door. Too far away from your door and the video doorbell loses much of its usefulness. You'll also need to follow the height direction. For most video doorbells including Ring, that means placing the doorbell about four feet from the base of the door so it gets a good view of people and packages alike.

Ring video doorbell FAQs
How long does a Ring doorbell battery last?
If your Ring doorbell isn't hardwired, the battery charge will typically last between six and 12 months, depending on the frequency of use and motion activations. You will receive an alert via the Ring app when the battery is getting low.When charging your Ring doorbell's battery, be sure to let it sit until fully charged, if possible, as doing so can help prolong the life of the battery.
Is Ring a one-time purchase?
A monthly subscription isn't required to use your Ring device, but there are three protection plans available if you'd like additional video storage and features. The lowest tier, which starts at $5 per month, adds important features like object recognition and video storage. The highest tier is designed more for whole Ring Alarm systems and won't be necessary if you're only getting a doorbell.
How are Ring doorbells powered?
Most Ring doorbells are powered by a rechargeable battery or have a battery backup, so losing power to your home shouldn't disrupt power to your device. Still, a power outage may affect your Ring device if your router loses power and the Wi-Fi connection is lost.
Does Ring offer professional home monitoring services?
Ring focuses on DIY devices and systems that don’t require any kind of monitoring to use. On their own, Ring video doorbells don't offer professional home monitoring. However, if you install a Ring Alarm system, you have the option of choosing the Ring Protect Pro plan, which includes 24/7 home monitoring as part of its services.
What is Ring Neighbors?
Neighbors is a separate Ring app that's connected to the Ring app you use to control devices like doorbells. It's more of a community-focused, social app. You can share videos with people in your community, get alerts from videos others share in return and similar activities. Some people like the extra assurance it provides since they can get notifications about residential crime or other happenings.
