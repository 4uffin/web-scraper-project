Installing a security system can deter burglars from sneaking in to steal your stuff while you're on vacation this summer. According to Consumer Affairs, over 60% of burglars would avoid a home with a visible on-site alarm system. DIY security systems let you build a customized solution tailored specifically to your household -- from basic motion sensors to advanced outdoor cameras and full alarm networks. Plus, installing a security system yourself can help you save big compared to professionally installed systems, even with established brands like ADT. We've tested dozens of options to help you find the best DIY security system for your home. Our Picks

Best overall DIY home security system
Ring Alarm Kit (2nd-gen)
Pros
Reasonable pricing
Handy app
Good extras
Included range extender
Easy to expand
Cons
Not everyone needs a range extender
Limited smart home integration
This eight-piece Ring Alarm system offers an excellent kit for smaller homes at a reasonable price, with a reliable platform that can easily connect to any Amazon Echo or Alexa devices you may have (if you choose a subscription). The kit includes a base station, a keypad for arming/disarming, four contact sensors for guarding various entry points, a motion detector and a range extender if your Wi-Fi network doesn’t quite reach the outskirts of your home where you’d like to place sensors.Ring’s app offers a simple setup process that first-timers shouldn’t have much difficulty with. If you’d like to add other devices over time, Ring products like a Ring video doorbell or a Ring security camera will happily work with your app and may connect to the hub as well. Other smart home devices may not be as compatible -- parent company Amazon prefers to keep Ring within its own ecosystem of products, so integrations with platforms like Google Assistant aren’t possible.Finally, the Ring Protect plan offers a few extras at its lowest tier, but things get much more interesting at the $20 per month Pro plan, which adds home monitoring -- making your DIY one a professionally monitored system -- that can be a valuable add-on for those who want professional responses during emergencies.  ...

Best DIY home security system with router
Ring Alarm Pro
Pros
Good price for the kit
Wi-Fi 6 router
Strong security performance
Great Alexa integration
Cons
Router is required for system use
Few integration options
The Ring Alarm Pro is similar to our top Ring Alarm pick but with a few key differences. It’s more expensive, and the primary reason is its included Eero Wi-Fi 6 router. For some people, that’s great: Wi-Fi 6 is the latest router standard that many people still haven’t upgraded to, and you don’t have to worry about choosing a new router separately. For others who have a preferred router brand or already have a Wi-Fi 6 router, the Pro package presents a problem, because some features won’t work without this particular router.Otherwise, the Ring Alarm Pro system includes a keypad, four contact sensors and a motion sensor as well as an alarm range extender (although the kit doesn’t include alarm sensors so you’ll need to buy these separately). Again, it’s a great package for Alexa users and those who are interested in adding more Ring or Amazon products down the road.  ... Show more

Best basic DIY home security system
SimpliSafe Home Security
Pros
Easy to install and operate
Great customizability
Professional monitoring options
Cons
Limited smart home integrations
SimpliSafe was one of the first DIY home security systems to hit the market and is a reasonable alternative to ADT and other professional alarm company firms. That's due in large part to its affordable cost and wide variety of accessories in comparison to most security systems. SimpliSafe makes a variety of different starter kits that usually start at around $320, and you can often get them for less through discounts. SimpliSafe's impressive array of accessories such as indoor and outdoor security cameras, key fob, additional motion sensors, smoke detectors, glass break sensors and siren, and its solid performance for the price makes it an easy choice. A subscription plan is necessary to get all features, and those start at around $10 per month for self-monitoring.  ... Show more

Best apartment-friendly DIY home security system
Arlo Home Security
8.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
System is agile and responsive
Modular system can be customized to your needs
Each sensor performs eight different functions
Cons
Gets fairly expensive once you add accessories and professional monitoring
No integration with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant
Battery and cellular backup costs an extra $80
Arlo, the maker of one of our favorite outdoor security cameras, introduced its home security system in 2022 and it immediately stood out for its All-in-One sensors. While most home security sensors serve a single purpose such as motion or sound detection, the Arlo All-in-One sensors are capable of eight different detection functions. The sensors can detect motion and sounds such as smoke or CO alarms, plus changes in ambient light or temperature. That's great if you have a small place like an apartment, dorm or bedroom and want quick sensor placement that can do a little of everything, anywhere.If you want to go bigger, it's easy to customize the system by adding Arlo cams or doorbells that will also work with the hub. You don't need an Arlo Secure plan for basic features, but if you branch out we suggest it to get extras like video storage.

Best DIY home security system for existing smart homes
Abode Smart Security Kit
Pros
Great smart home integration
Apple support
Mini sensor can fit in tight places
Cons
Only a couple of sensors for the price
The Abode Smart Security kit is slightly smaller than our other picks, providing a hub, one mini door/window sensor, a motion sensor and a key fob. You can easily purchase separate sensor packs to expand it, and even its slimmed-down kit offers serious advantages. Notably, it’s one of the few DIY systems that works well with Apple’s Home app and Siri. That’s only the beginning of Abode’s smart home integration, which also supports numerous products from Sonos, Bose, Yale, Schlage, Philips Hue, Ecobee and many more. That makes it the perfect fit for someone who already has a family of (random) smart devices to link up.Abode’s standard subscription plan includes video storage and enables much of that smart home integration, so we highly suggest considering it. The much more expensive Pro plan gives you professional home monitoring but not many other notable additions.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing a DIY home security system
When selecting a home security system, the first decision to consider is usually whether you want a DIY or a pro system. Since you're here, you've probably already decided to go the DIY route, so here are some more parameters to consider when shopping around for home security systems.Equipment and installation Do you just need to keep watch over your entryways? A good video doorbell for your front door and an outdoor camera covering the back may be all you need; easy to install and monitor yourself. If you want to keep closer tabs on your home inside and out with 24/7 monitoring and quick access to emergency response services, you'll want a more robust system. Most DIY (and professional brands too) offer home security bundles with most, if not all, of the equipment you'd need to get started and the ability to add single devices as needed.Smart home compatibilityMost home security devices are compatible with Alexa and Google Home smart hubs, but if you prefer Apple HomeKit or another smart home ecosystem, you may have to do a bit more shopping and comparing to find a system compatible with your existing smart home devices. Don't fret over compatibility too much, as Matter will make it easier to connect previously incompatible devices.Costs, upfront and ongoing We listed "cost" last here for a reason. A complete home security system will likely cost you at least a couple of hundred bucks, so be prepared for that. There's the potential to spend lots more on equipment, or a lot less; you can find cameras for under $30.Find your budget range and compare systems in that range across brands. For a home security kit, most starter bundles fall in the same range. If you're comfortable with self-monitoring, DIY systems may not come with any ongoing costs. Monthly subscriptions (without a contract) for cloud storage, enhanced features and possibly even professional monitoring are typically an option with DIY systems, often for lower monthly fees than professional services. How we test home security systems
Hands-on testing is core to our evaluations of any home security products. In short, when it comes to home security systems, we pay special attention to the user experience, the promised features, reliability and overall value, along with a few other elements. We do the testing in a real home environment over at least a full week. Our testing process includes checking the reliability of the product by gauging the response time. A system which doesn't send notifications on time isn't of much value to customers who might need immediate assistance. All our testing is done in a real home environment for at least a week which guarantees that we are able to come across any gotcha's, or practical problems with the security system. Finally, we ascertain the systems a value score based on the feature set, our experience with the product, and, just as important, the price. If you want to read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security systems and services. Other DIY home security systems we tested
The above systems weren't the only DIY options we explored. Here are other competitive security systems we took a look at, and why they didn't quite make our list.Cove: Cove’s standard lineup is fine, but its generic quality struggled to compete with our picks. If you can’t really find what you’re looking for on our list, stop by Cove to check how its kits fit.Lorex: Lorex is an excellent home security option for those who prefer sticking with local storage. It is a bit expensive compared to other DIY systems and may require working with its somewhat clunky recorder.Frontpoint: Frontpoint has a strong array of kits, but like ADT, its massive home monitoring fees (starting at $50) are too difficult to recommend.Kangaroo: Kangaroo has budget-friendly systems but struggles with design quality. If you want to save as much money as possible, you may want to give it a try.Wyze: Wyze offers a great starter home kit, but its current security flaws keep it off our list for now. How do I choose the best DIY home security system?
When choosing the right DIY home security system, there are a few key factors to keep in mind. Cost is one of the biggest considerations -- both in terms of upfront equipment pricing and ongoing subscription fees for things like monitoring or cloud storage. Entry-level systems can start at around $100, especially if you catch a sale. However, prices can easily climb to $200 or $300 or more as you add sensors, cameras, or alarms. It’s also worth noting that many of these systems go on sale throughout the year, which can help keep costs in check.Beyond cost, think about how many entry points like doors and windows you want to secure. Some starter kits come with just a base and one or two sensors, while more robust options like the Ring Alarm Pro offer multiple sensors, motion detectors, and even range extenders. More expensive systems tend to offer better smart home integration and extra features, so it’s important to weigh functionality against your budget. Also consider whether you want local or subscription-based storage and monitoring -- some systems offer DIY, no-cost options, while others require a monthly fee for full access. DIY home security system FAQs
Is it better to have professional home security service over a DIY version?
A DIY home security system certainly has its advantages, like lower pricing and simple self-installation, but professional security has its perks. DIY systems are typically easy to install and set up. You won't have to worry about setup if your system is installed by an experienced technician. Professional systems are generally more expensive than DIY but may come with lower upfront costs. You can get free or discounted equipment and free installation with a professional system, but you may also have to sign a one- or two-year contract.Signing a contract is unfortunate, but the level of monitoring, support and warranties may be worth it. While DIY systems often come with warranties, monitoring options and technical support on their own, professional services are likely going to deliver a more hassle-free experience if you're willing to pay for it.

How much do DIY home security systems cost?
A DIY security system can cost $60 to $400 or more depending on the brand and model you buy and where you buy it. SimpliSafe's 10-piece DIY home security system lists for $730 on its website. Those prices can go much higher if you opt for all the bells and whistles the service offers.Like with any addition or upgrade to your home, you'll want to evaluate the costs, and what you get for the money when choosing a DIY security system. It's easy for the cost of a DIY system to add up, but keep in mind that choosing a cheaper system that doesn't meet your needs may not be worth your while either.
