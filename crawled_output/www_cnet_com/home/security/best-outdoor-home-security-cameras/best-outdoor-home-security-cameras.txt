How we test
What to consider
Power
Do you need a wireless, battery model to position an outdoor camera where you want it? Will the cam be in a position to get cable power through a junction box or similar approach?
Durability
Does the outdoor cam have an IP rating designed for all kinds of weather? Do you need extra resistance to temps below zero in your climate?
Video Storage
How do you want to story security videos? Do you prefer local or cloud storage? Are you willing to pay a subscription fee? What about a microSD card for local storage? Are you worried about home videos being leaked online via the cloud?
Resolution
Does the camera have at least an HD resolution? If it's looking over a broad area, would you pay extra for a 2K or 4K camera? Is the field of view wide enough to capture the angle that you have in mind?
Motion Detection
Does the camera's motion detection come with object recognition to identify people vs. animals vs. vehicles and so on? If it's a camera looking at the front door, does it have package recognition?
Extra features
Features like two-way audio, night vision, sirens and customized alerts can be very important additions to these kinds of home security cameras.

Smart outdoor security cameras keep watch even when you're not around, giving you customizable notifications to help prevent trespassers and porch pirates. Today's wireless models can go nearly anywhere, while wired models come with powerful LED floodlights. Our Picks

Outdoor security camera FAQ
That's a lot of options, which is why I and other CNET experts have spent years and over 200 hours testing security cameras with weather resistance and powerful resolution to keep watch over outdoor spaces like driveways, backyards, patios and walkways.What is the best overall outdoor home security camera?
The Arlo Pro 5S 2K's combination of features and compatibility is unparalleled. ArloAfter rigorous testing, we're recommending the Arlo Pro 6 wireless security camera. Its combination of features and compatibility is unparalleled. It packs in audio, a spotlight, a high-res lens and (if you pay for it) Arlo's extra-advanced AI detection features. Plus, at $125, it's far more affordable than pricey floodlight cameras and remains one of the best outdoor security cameras we've tested.After more than five years of testing cameras from Blink, Eufy, Lorex, Nest, Ring and TP-Link, we've also picked several other models. Whether you're looking for a broad floodlight or would prefer a budget cam that costs much less, check out the options below. We've also included tips on what makes an outdoor cam worthwhile, information on how we test and guidance on how to place cameras around your home (and where not to put security cams).

Best overall outdoor security camera
Arlo Pro 6
Pros
160-degree view
12x digital zoom and autotracking
DIY-friendly
Long battery life with low-power modes,
Integrated spotlight
Useful down to -20 degrees,
Two-way audio
Cons
Full features, including highest resolution, require subscription
Expensive
Local storage is even more expensive
Why I like it:If cost is no problem and you're looking for the latest features, the Arlo Pro6 is a top-line DIY model updated in 2025 for the latest features. The 2K video resolution yields extra detail (although a subscription is required for maximum resolution), a 160-degree field of view is great on a cam this size and color night vision works very well to enhance images in dark conditions. It's wireless for flexible installation options and the battery is better than ever (rated up to eight months) with
low-power modes to help decrease those tiresome recharging sessions. As always, I remain deeply impressed with Arlo's design qualty, which stands above almost every other security brand.The outdoor camera also has particularly useful extras for an all-purpose security camera. The integrated spotlight turns on in low-light conditions (although you can control this via the app) and I found that the auto-tracking and the 12x zoom function help focus coverage on the most important details. The two-way audio is also a nice touch if you prefer to have cam-based conversations or call out strangers. With UV resistance, weather resistance and an operating temperature range down to minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, it's ready for homes in nearly any climate.While the camera gets added benefits such as optimized battery life from being connected to an Arlo Security System or base station, it’s still easy to use it solo. The Arlo Secure subscription not only unlocks 2K resolution streaming but also enables cloud recording and, at higher tiers, enables Arlo's numerous customizable AI detection and alert features like event captions. If you prefer local storage, you’ll have to add an Arlo SmartHub or Base Station, which can cost more than $100.Who is this for:People who want a camera that does everything -- with plenty to tinker with over time -- and who don't mind paying a subscription fee.Who shouldn’t buy it:Those who want a simple cam without a lot of features to learn, and people who want to avoid monthly fees.  ...

Best budget outdoor security camera
TP-Link Tapo C310
Pros
Versatile camera with antennas for Wi-Fi
98-foot night vision
2K resolution
Siren included
Local storage option
Cons
Plug-in model makes installation more difficult
Two-way audio has limited use when watching a driveway
Why I like it:Worried about your car's catalytic converter or windows? Sometimes it can be difficult to watch a full driveway with a security camera, especially if it gets really dark. A camera equipped with an automatic siren, spotlight and night vision up to 98 feet away, like the TP-Link Tapo C310, can be one of your most effective tools for keeping trespassers at bay. You can position the camera to watch specific zones, like a driveway, at scheduled times and blare its siren and spotlight when anyone crosses the detection line.The outdoor camera also has 2K resolution, Alexa and Google Assistant compatibility, and local storage via a microSD card slot (card not included). If you want cloud storage, Tapo Care plans start around $3 a month per camera and include 30 days of event recording. The IP66 weather rating will keep it safe, too.While the camera supports Wi-Fi or PoE (Power over Ethernet) if your Wi-Fi won't reach that far away from the house, it will require a wired connection. Unlike many wired outdoor cameras, the C310 doesn't support wiring directly into a junction box. You'll need an outdoor-rated socket to plug it in, which is its one downside.Who is this for:People with long, dark driveways who have an outdoor outlet handy. Who shouldn’t buy it:People without outdoor outlets who don't want to hire an electrician.  ... Show more

Best camera that doesn't need Wi-Fi
Arlo Go 2
Pros
Excellent LTE option for zones outside Wi-Fi
Can still use Wi-Fi to save data
Spotlight and night vision included
Location tracking for finding lost cams
Great weather protection
Cons
A bit pricey
Really needs an Arlo plan to unlock all features
Why I like it:If you need a camera to keep watch over a place where Wi-Fi doesn't reach, (such as construction sites, adjacent workshops or camping trips), you may want to shop for a smart security camera that connects over cellular data. Your top two options are the Arlo Go 2 and the Eufy 4G Starlight Cam, each of which includes a SIM card slot for cellular connectivity along with similar features, including night vision and customizable motion alerts. I personally advise the 1080p Arlo model. For one, the Arlo Go 2 includes a microSD card slot for local storage whereas the Eufy camera only has a limiting 8GB of built-in storage. Also, the Arlo Go 2 can connect over LTE and Wi-Fi while the Eufy 4G Starlight Cam doesn't support Wi-Fi. That makes the Go 2 the more flexible of the two cameras, suitable for close to home or watching far-away properties -- and I like the Arlo app much better, while Eufy's app tends to be messy for first-time users.Keep in mind that you'll need an Arlo Secure plan starting at $8 per month to enable advanced AI notifications, the highest video resolution and cloud recordings. A microSD card slot is available for local storage (and to help keep from running into data caps or similar issues), but you'll be giving up those additional features.Who is this for: Anyone looking for off-site cameras and cameras that don’t need to rely on Wi-Fi, and people who have especially large properties to watch.Who shouldn’t buy it: People who won’t want to pay more for a cellular connection.  ...

Ring

Ring
Best outdoor security camera with spotlight
Ring Spotlight Cam Pro
Pros
Compact design with bright LEDs and easy battery swapping
Color night vision
Customization for motion detection
Full Alexa compatibility
Cons
Subscription required to unlock useful features
Spotlight may be too small for large areas
Why I like it:A dedicated spotlight cam focuses a beam of light in a specific direction, helping you light up dark porches, walkways, patios and corners of your yard where visibility is lacking. The Ring Spotlight Cam Pro upgrades the Plus model in several ways, including 3D motion detection, HDR views and enhanced audio.Few spotlight cams have such a compact design with durable LED bars that make it easy to position and angle the camera (140-degree field of view) in many directions. When power is low, the pop-out battery is easy to recharge without messing with your perfect angle.The 1080p cam comes with color night vision, two-way audio and a siren you can sound when necessary. There are also privacy zones and motion zones you can tweak to control where the motion detection focuses. It can handle temperatures down to minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit, so it’s no slouch during winter, either.Ring’s camera is designed to work with a Ring Protect plan, which starts at $5 per month and we consider it more or less mandatory for this cam. It enables valuable features, including the ability to record footage to the cloud, recognize people (and ignore other movement), and switch to an away mode. The biggest problem with this feature set is how expensive it is, making this the priciest cam on my list. Who is this for:Buyers looking for a compact spotlight camera that provides a lot of info about what's happening around the yard. Who shouldn’t buy it:Buyers who want to save money and who don't like Alexa.

Best outdoor security camera for battery life
Blink Outdoor 4
Pros
Battery rated for two years
Includes Sync Module 2
Dual-zone motion detection
Full Alexa compatibility
Cons
1080p resolution could be higher
AA lithium batteries are awkward
Subscription required for full features
Why I like it:Wireless security cams offer a lot to like for the modern homeowner. You can install them at nearly any awkward angle to cover blind spots or find the perfect vantage point, and there’s never any need to call an electrician. In return, you have to manage battery power, and that can be a tough sell when the best spot for an outdoor camera is a hard-to-reach area. Blink’s fourth-generation outdoor cam addresses the issue head-on with powered AA lithium batteries rated for up to two years of use before you have to worry about replacing them -- mine is set to last even longer than that, the last time I checked.Battery life isn’t the only thing the Outdoor 4 brings to the table. This battery-powered camera offers a 1080p resolution, infrared night vision, two-way audio and dual-zone motion detection. Amazon’s security platform has full Alexa compatibility, too, so you can look at a live view from an Echo Show, among other tricks.Note that the Blink Outdoor 4 comes with a Sync Module 2 for local storage so you don’t have to worry about buying a hub, but you will need a USB drive to connect to it. A Blink subscription, which starts at $3 per month, adds cloud storage and person detection.Who is this for:Anyone looking for an all-purpose outdoor camera that they don't have to worry about recharging. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who really don't like Alexa and who want a high-resolution camera.  ... Show more

Best AI outdoor security camera
Google Nest Indoor/Outdoor Cam (2nd gen)
Pros
Compact, wireless and easy to install
Google's useful AI detection
6x digital zoom
Excellent free video storage
Indoor or outdoor placement
Cons
Field of view is a little small
May run into problems at lower temps
Why I like it:Google Nest's bobbly wireless cam has secrets: It’s surprisingly powerful, offers infrared LEDs for night vision and comes with IP54 weather resistance for outside use. It's also equipped with free AI detection for people, packages and animals to cut down on unnecessary alerts while giving you important info.The 1080p model has a 130-degree field of view and you can quickly adjust its focus thanks to the 6x digital zoom and easy-to-install base. Motion detection, two-way audio and compatibility with Google Assistant and Alexa round this cam off nicely.AI alerts aren't the only free feature, either. I also like how this camera include three free hours of video storage, usually enough to take a break and check the details of an alert that you received. Nest Aware plans add more features but that’s a more-than-competitive deal if you want to avoid subscription fees. Plus, you can easily move it inside or outside depending on where you think you need security the most. Just be careful of temperatures that fall below freezing as this cam isn't rated for especially cold conditions.Who is this for:Users who like AI object recognition and some cloud storage but don't want to pay for it and buyers who may want to move the camera inside, especially over the winter. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who dislike Nest and Google Home and those looking for a high-resolution camera.

360 tracking cam with 2K resolution
Smart motion detection for people, vehicles, etc.
Alexa and Google compatibility
MicroSD card slot for storage
Cons
Local storage will cost more to set up
Eufy's app experience can get pretty messy
Why I like it:Solar cameras offer an alternative to the traditional home security tech: A cam that you can theoretically keep charged with a few hours of well-positioned sunlight every day. The problem is that juggling a separate outdoor camera and solar panel installation is tricky, especially if you’re short on room. Eufy’s 2K-resolution cam offers a built-in panel that you can also remove and place nearby as needed for top-notch versatility. The E30 offers pan/tilt features that pair very nicely with its AI tracking features for humans and vehicles. The cam also includes night vision and two-way audio, plus IP65 weather resistance.The cam is also designed to work without any subscriptions or add-ons, but you will need to add a microSD card for local video storage or a HomeBase S280. I'm also testing the Eufy E42 package, which pairs two similar cameras together with a HomeBase for those want a larger solar packageWho is this for:People who don't want to worry about battery life and who want to dodge subscription fees.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who plan on storing a lot of video with frequent activations. People who don't have the room or patience to manage a solar panel add-on installation.  ... Show more

Best outdoor security camera with no subscription
Lorex 2K Wi-Fi Floodlight Camera
Pros
Adjustable and customizable LED floodlights
Person and vehicle detection
2K resolution
No subscription needed for onboard video storage
Cons
MicroSD card may need to be upgraded for larger video storage
Without an existing junction box, installation may be expensive
Why I like it:I've tested many floodlight cameras that I like, from the Nest Cam with floodlights that works so well with my Google Home app to the Arlo 2K wired floodlight model, which does a little of everything even if it needs a subscription to really shine. But ultimately I'm recommending this Lorex model for its combo of strong features and non-subscription model.For example, the 2K resolution is excellent for a floodlight cam, which tends to overlook a large space and benefits from as many pixels as possible. It pairs well with Lorex’s person-oriented motion detection, and the compatibility with Alexa and Google Home means you can use voice commands and smart displays for lots of added functionality. If the cam is close enough you can activate two-way audio and the adjustable floodlights include not only four different light scheduling options but the ability to set brightness and color temperature, something traditional floodlights just can’t do.Lorex avoids subscription fees, instead offering a pre-installed 32GB microSD chip, which cuts costs and helps secure privacy but you may need to spend time deleting videos or upgrade to a larger card when that fills up..Who is this for:Buyers looking for a highly adaptable floodlight camera that focuses on onboard storage with no extra fees.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who like the versatility of cloud storage or prefer a brand that works more directly with their preferred app, like the Nest floodlight cam and Google Home.  ...

Factors to consider when buying an outdoor security camera
The Blink Outdoor 4 has an adjustable mount that's sturdy enough to stay at the right angle. Tyler Lacoma/CNETHow you power the cameraOutdoor cameras need reliable power. Some users have no problems recharging a battery every several months, which typically takes about 6 hours connected to an adapter or simply leaving it overnight. Others may want to place cameras in positions where regular recharging is difficult. Wired versions of cameras skip this step but often require existing wiring in a junction box or some significant electrical work. Outdoor cameras with lights especially benefit from being wired, because lights are such a drain on battery life. Then there's PoE, or Power over Ethernet, which supplies an internet connection and power at the same time but requires a dedicated Ethernet line. These days, we're also seeing a growing number of solar outdoor cameras that offer a charging alternative, too.All those choices come down to ease of use: We're looking for cams with reliable power options, excellent battery life, usable solar panels and other home-friendly aspects. The higher the camera is placed and the more power it uses, the more a wired solution becomes important.DurabilityOutdoor cams must be weather-resistant and high-quality versions should be able to handle low temperatures as well. Look for IP ratings, like IP65, which shows rain and dust resistance. If it gets cold in your area, look for cameras that are rated to operate well below freezing (most brands will give you a temperature operating range).Video storage and securityWhat do outdoor cameras do with the video they capture? The two primary choices are cloud storage through an internet connection and local storage through a hub or microSD card. Cloud storage is easy to capture and share but usually needs a subscription and raises privacy concerns when police can request video footage directly from companies.Local storage is more private but can be harder to manage when storage starts getting full and needs to be culled. High-resolution video can fill up a small microSD card in a week or two if activations are frequent enough. Our list includes options for both, plus choices like the Nest Cam, which offers free cloud storage. If you're getting a microSD for local storage, we suggest getting a larger one, more than 100GB if possible.Video encryption is also important to help secure video transfer and access. At this point, we would bring up the latest protocols like Matter and Thread, designed to make smart devices safer and more compatible with different platforms. While this compatibility can help many smart devices, Matter doesn't support video quite yet, so it won't apply to most of your data management here.Resolution and field of viewA security camera needs high-quality video and imaging to do its job well. The minimum these days is 1080p, and we're seeing a growing number of 2K and even 4K home security cameras available for greater detail. Don't go below HD-level if possible. Field of view, while less important, also helps a camera capture as large of an area as possible, which can be helpful when watching the entire front of a home or a whole backyard. About the best we've seen here is 160 degrees, but a 130-degree cam can still do well, especially if it's easy to angle.
Blink's streamlined menu makes arming the cam or checking the live view effortless. Tyler Lacoma/CNETMotion detection and recognitionMotion detection saves on video recordings and helps control adjacent features like spotlights and the important mobile alerts you can get on your phone. It's typically an automatic feature but made immensely better when a camera has AI recognition capabilities (preferably free). These help the camera ignore cars, leaves and possibly even animals in favor of humans, or let you choose alerts based on the subject matter. Together, the two features are a powerful mix.Extra features like two-way audioTwo-way audio can prove helpful if it's high-quality and the camera is close enough to people to be intelligible. Lighting is a very useful feature on any outdoor camera, which is why about half of our list includes lighting of some kind (and all have night vision).Solar powerMost security companies now offer solar panels that you can connect to outdoor cameras. They help keep batteries recharged and if you get a lot of sun you may not have to worry about battery life for years. See if this addition makes sense for your home: While the panels can be easily angled, they will take up more space and require separate mounts. Other outdoor security cameras we tested
You don't have to hard-wire the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera. ArloWe've tested dozens of the most popular cameras from the biggest brands, including Google Nest, Amazon Blink, Amazon Ring, Wyze, Arlo, Eufy, Canary and more. If you're wondering why some cams made it on our current list and others didn't, it's important to note we're always watching the latest updates on features, subscriptions, privacy and new models to keep our picks current. Outdoor cams we tested that didn't quite make the list this time include: Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight: If you're looking for a floodlight cam, this is a very strong option. We found the adjustable LED panels on the Lorex model more useful, and as we noted, a wired version is often better for power-hungry floodlights. Still, this model reviewed very well and made it onto our list of the best home security cams with lights.Wyze Outdoor Cam v2: Wyze remains a strong choice for budget security cameras but Wyze continues to run into security and privacy concerns, from data breaches in recent years to video caching issues that let strangers see through each other's Wyze cams in 2023 and other breaches in 2024. We aren't going to recommend this cam until we're sure all security issues have been cleared up.Nest Cam with Floodlight: The Nest Cam does have a version with floodlights but at $279 it's expensive for what you get. We preferred other floodlight options, although the Nest version could be an alternative if you really want free cloud storage and Google's AI detection.Ring Stick Up Cam: While weather-resistant, we found the Ring Stick Up Cam slightly too fragile compared to our final picks. It's best used as an indoor/outdoor cam that you can move between places at will or find a sheltered spot under a patio to mount.Eufy EufyCam S221(Update: Currently unavailable) The S221 is a high-quality camera model with some potential for outside use, but we disliked how a separate HomeBase 2 was absolutely required to use it, liking the versatility that Eufy's solar cam provided instead. How we test home security cameras
Arlo's cam isn't weatherproof, which means no outdoor possibilities for this little guy. David Priest/CNETWe’ve spent half a dozen years testing security cams, and developed a battery of tests and trials to determine exactly what outdoor cameras can do.Setup and installationAs we set up cameras, we watch for how easy it is for a newcomer to understand, what mounting options are present and how easy the camera is to set to the right angle. We also look at the software side of things, like how difficult it is to set up an account and how good the walkthroughs are. After installation, we like to run cameras for at least a week and preferably a month so that we can see how they perform over time, how quickly the battery goes down and if any errors creep into their objection detection. Video quality and audio performanceVideo and live view clarity are especially important for outdoor cameras so we test them in multiple conditions in backyards or testing facilities. We also experiment with night vision and how many yards it reaches. The details are important here, such as delays and latency in showing live views. This is also an excellent time to test out audio functions and how clear audio is at 10 or 20 feet, especially in real-world conditions like a windy day.
Arlo's home app showing widget options. Tyler Lacoma/CNETMotion detection, alerts and AISecurity cameras have advanced features that we test with various scenarios, from delivering and "stealing" a package to walking a dog. That's when we see if motion detection and AI object recognition are accurate, timely and and work consistently over time. We adjust motion sensitivity and motion windows to test their accuracy as well. App performance and UIIf you buy a security camera, you'll spend a lot of time in its app, at least on setup and probably very frequently afterward for live views and alert controls. So we check out the app thoroughly, including how easy it is to navigate, how simple the menus are to learn and if the app is cluttered or provides everything you want in a speedy layout. If you want to read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security cameras and video doorbells.
Apple's app looks and feels great but you'll need compatible devices for it. Apple Recent updates
Fall 2025: Arlo's cam gets a worthy upgrade to the latest Pro 6 model, which includes new features like the option to choose an expanded battery pack. I also switched Eufy's pick out for the newer E30 model, which offers panning and has a solar panel that can connect to the cam or be used separately as needed.
Nest's versatile cam pairs well with a solar panel.
Wasserstein Outdoor security camera FAQ
":"What type of outdoor security camera is best?","answer":"Outdoor security cameras can be used for various purposes and your particular needs will determine which one is best. If you're looking for minimal upkeep, an outdoor camera with a power cord might be the best bet, whereas monitoring spaces far from a power outlet could make a battery-powered device a better option. In general, outdoor cameras with at least 1080p resolution, a wide field of view, night vision and deterrence features like a spotlight or alarm will serve you well.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"},{"question":"What are the privacy and security considerations for outdoor cameras?","answer":"If you're privacy conscious, then your best bet is to shop for security cameras that let you store the footage locally, usually on a microSD card or some other means of storage on the device itself. Once you start uploading your video for storage on a company's servers, that footage is subject to the company's policies regarding storing and sharing it.On the security front, the best way to keep your footage safe from unauthorized access or hacks is to make sure that you're using two-factor authentication, which greatly reduces the odds that anyone can access your account without your knowledge. If you're uploading footage to a company's servers, you'll want to make sure that the footage is encrypted along the way.The most secure approach is end-to-end encryption, or E2EE, which means nobody can access your footage without a unique decryption key associated with your device. With E2EE, even the company you're storing the footage with shouldn't be able to access your clips. \"Encryption in transit\" and \"encryption at rest\" are good standards as well but they wouldn't necessarily prevent the company you're storing footage with from being able to access your clips.One more thing: It should go without saying but these outdoor cameras are meant to keep an eye on your own home and property. Set one up someplace where you don't have permission or where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy and you "_blank\" rel=\"\" data-id=\"739f1084-e67f-4e22-b590-5500eeecf60c\" href=\"https://www.safewise.com/security-camera-laws/\">could run afoul of the law.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"},{"question":"What is the best security camera for cold weather?","answer":"Whether you're worried about extreme cold, rain or any other inclement weather, you'll want to be sure to check your camera's IP rating and lowest operating temperature. IP ratings of 65 or 66 are solid; you won't get dust into the outdoor camera or water unless submerged.Generally, you'll also want to compare your regional winter temperatures to your camera's lowest operating temperature. Battery-operated cameras usually need warmer temperatures. The Google Nest Cam may start running into trouble as temperatures go below 32 degrees Fahrenheit regularly, while our top Arlo pick can work at minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"},{"question":"What do I do if my outdoor camera records a crime?","answer":"If you believe your outdoor camera has recorded footage of a crime, first download or transfer that footage as a shareable video file on your computer so you don’t have to worry about it disappearing. Then look up your local police website and see if they can file a police report online. Most do and you will usually have an opportunity to attach your video footage. Those steps are important for legal and insurance purposes.If you want to pursue the incident, we suggest you immediately call the police afterward and explain your situation, clearly stating that you have evidence and are interested in taking further steps. If you aren’t seeing the desired results from your conversations, consider consulting with a criminal attorney or similar legal expert.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"},{"question":"Do standard outdoor security cameras have night vision?","answer":"Yes, all outdoor security cameras should have some capability to let you see and record at night time, but some of them have extra night vision features. For example, the Arlo Pro 5S 2K has color night vision that can enhance the scene of dark environments. The TP-Link Tapo C310 also has night vision reaching 98 feet. If you're looking for specific night vision features, double-check the model you're considering to make sure it has what you want.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"},{"question":"How long do outdoor security camera batteries last?","answer":"Battery life varies based on many factors, most notably activations or every time it turns on to record sensed motion. If that happens 12 to 20 times a day, a battery can quickly drain over a few weeks. For normal activations, most batteries last several months or so. There are also outliers, like the Blink Outdoor 4. It's two-year rated battery has held up under our testing and may even exceed that mark.","quickTake":"","canCollapse":"true","collapseOnPageLoad":"false","canTruncate":"true","truncateOnPageLoad":"false"}]" ng-block="{"id":"d70z60sfdgm0tg3","type":"faq"}" edition="us"> Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews.
