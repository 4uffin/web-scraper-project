Home apps vary a lot in design, but these options are some of my favorites. Kmatta via Getty
Not all home apps are equal. Your app experience can make or break the smart home devices you choose, such as security cameras or smart bulbs. The worst apps have confusing menus, lack settings and are even cluttered with ads. The best apps are clean, speedy and can help you control your home tech with just a few taps. It's not always easy to know if a home app is going to be user-friendly or a pain until you start using it. That's where I come in: I've tested dozens of smart home apps during my reviews from all the major brands. These are my top picks that I truly enjoyed using, and why.Blink app (security cameras)
Blink app and Outdoor cam home scren. Tyler Lacoma/CNETBlink offers devices like the Blink Outdoor 4 cam and the Blink Mini 2, compact and usually affordable security cameras that are great for general purposes and first time users. One of the best things about getting a Blink camera is how the app is to understand and use. From setup to taking a casual look at a live view, Blink's app is one of the best I've come across. It's speedy, has settings that are easy to find, and keeps the clutter to a minimum.  Arlo app (security cameras and home security systems)
Arlo's home app showing widge options. Tyler Lacoma/CNETArlo's security app is certainly more complex than Blink's, but you can manage an Arlo security camera and Arlo home security system through it, so it needs to have a lot of features. I found that Arlo has one of the best setup walkthroughs for home security devices, a great start for newcomers that provides useful info in easy-to-understand packages. The Arlo interface is also clean and quite intuitive once set up. It allows for more customization than almost any home app I've found, allowing you to place a variety of widgets where you want on the home screen so you can quickly see or control what's important to you. Emporia Energy app (smart plug and energy management)
Emporia app energy use graph example for fountain. Tyler Lacoma/CNETEmporia's app offers lots of data, from electricity use graphs for your smart plug to in-depth settings for power schedules, peak use settings and integration with its energy monitors. So it's impressive Emporia manages to keep the app as tidy and user-friendly as it does, especially considering its speedy setup that can use your existing Google or Apple accounts. Nothing is ever more than a couple of taps away and Emporia's menu management makes it easy to understand where things are and what features will do. I've rarely seen a mobile app make things so clear. Switchbot app (locks, sensors, doorbells, etc.)
Switchbot's no-nonsense app is filled with useful information. Tyler Lacoma/CNETSwitchbot offers a variety of products I've tested, including leak detectors, air quality sensors, smart locks and others. Its app has always been pleasant to use, a minimalistic experience with an excellent overview on the home screen that collects device and general home info, making it feel more like a true home hub than most apps. Switchbot's automations menu takes an approach I appreciate, listing a dozen possible home routines and walking you through setup. It's a more comprehensive automation option than the suggestions some apps have, featuring clear explanations of why you might want a certain routine. Apple Home app (broad platform device management)
Apple's app looks and feels great but you'll need compatible devices for it. AppleApps like Apple Home or Google Home allow you to unite a range of smart home devices under one roof -- which means it has to be a good roof. One of my favorites for sheer simplicity is the Apple Home app. Its home screen is simple and very clean, a nice choice for those who get uncomfortable when there are too many buttons. The division between Categories and Rooms, which grow as you add devices, is an intuitive way to organize your tech. Of course, not everything works with Apple Home and not every device has all its features available via Apple Home, so there are some concessions for this simplified approach. However, out of the major home platform apps like Google Home or Alexa, Apple's version remains my favorite and excels at extra-speedy device management.Best Outdoor Home Security Cameras of 2025: Expert-Tested
