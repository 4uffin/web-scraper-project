CNET Zero, a series that chronicles the impact of climate change and explores what's being done about the problem.
What is the best thermostat overall?
Ecobee/CNETAfter many hours testing the functions of the latest smart thermostats, our experts recommend the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium as the top Wi-Fi thermostat that can do everything. This programmable thermostat not only learns your schedule, it also monitors your indoor air quality and lets you adopt Siri or Alexa voice assistant options if you don't have a smart speaker. We've also chosen Amazon's model for an excellent Alexa choice; Nest's latest thermostat for a beautiful, energy-saving powerhouse; an Ecobee model for a budget choice; and more. Take a look at the latest picks and our smart thermostat reviews, below. Best smart thermostats of 2025

Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium Jon Reed/CNET
Best overall smart thermostat
Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium
Pros
Learning and vacation modes for complete control
Reliable air quality monitoring
Built-in speaker for Alexa or Siri
Included remote temperature sensor
Can control other Ecobee products
Cons
Very expensive
Why I like it:One of the selling points of a smart thermostat is that it can save you money, so we can’t say money is no object. But if money is no object, the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium eclipses the competition. It offers the most advanced features, like a little sensor with a magnetic stand I could put in any room, and the ability to show a four-day forecast on the thermostat itself.The Ecobee model also comes with a separate satellite sensor to target heating or cooling to levels in a specific room. When I asked Ecobee about its latest features, they responded that the thermostat could help save up to 26% on energy bills and mentioned, "One of my favorite recent additions to the Ecobee smart thermostat experience is Home Energy Reports. These interactive reports help you visualize and understand the direct benefit of our temperature optimizations on your home’s energy use."While many smart thermostats can work with voice assistant platforms like Google's Home/Gemini options or Alexa, this Premium model is the only one that offers built-in compatibility (plus a mic and speaker) for Alexa and an option to add on Siri, so you don't need an app or smart speaker to give it commands.Who is this for:People who want a ton of smart features in a single device, including built-in voice assistants, and a satellite sensor for detailed home climate control.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who don't want to pay a lot of money, those who already have a smart speaker they're happy with, people who don't want to learn a lot of new features.  ...

Best smart thermostat for Alexa integration
Amazon Smart Thermostat
Pros
Built-in Alexa and Echo compatibility
Useful learning features for the price
Affordable at under $100
Explains energy settings to users
Cons
Basic design compared to competitor models
Amazon's data privacy raises more questions than other thermostat brands
Why I like it:The Amazon Smart Thermostat stands out among its peers in the sub-$100 category by having far better technology, including the ability to sense if you’re home and Alexa’s “hunches” to see if a setting will work while saving you energy. It'll save you lots of energy while paying itself off faster, making it an excellent starter model. And if you add an Echo Dot 5, the thermostat can use it as a separate room and air sensor, too.Amazon's model doesn’t have quite the advanced features of a $200 thermostat, and its display is fairly basic, but the savings are very significant, and not everyone wants a fancy touchscreen. Another thing I liked: It shows information about your energy and HVAC usage, explaining what it all means -- a smart thermostat that makes the customer smarter.Note: Read my full guide on smart thermostat privacy here to see how Amazon approaches this issue and why some users may want to take security precautions.Who is this for:People primarily interested in affordability and effective features, and less concerned with a bunch of extra learning features. It also helps if you don't mind Alexa and Amazon gleaning your household data.Who shouldn’t buy it:People who aren't fans of Alexa, users who want more smart and scheduling options, users particularly concerned about their home privacy.  ...

Nest's thermostat is pretty but the real advantage is the savings inside.  Tyler Lacoma/CNET
Best smart thermostat design
Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen)
Pros
Beautiful round display
Easy-to-use Eco Modes and energy reports
Satellite sensor for targeted heating
Compatibility with some Nest products like the Nest Hub Max
No C-wire required for installation
High-quality presence sensing
Cons
Expensive
Shiny display can be a little distracting
Why I like it:The newest version of the Nest Learning Thermostat brings the best high-tech smart technology to an attractive device that works even if your home doesn't have a C-wire. The new model builds on its predecessor's attractive design by adding a sensor that can tell how far you are from the thermostat and change the information on the faceplate accordingly. Mine can even show weather effects like falling snow or the setting sun depending on what's happening outside.Like Ecobee's, this model also comes with an included external room sensor, encouraging you from the start to keep track of the comfort level in more than just one room of your home. The beautiful design especially sparkles when showing outdoor temperatures with associated weather animations. On the more practical side, the Nest reports and easy-to-see Eco Modes make saving money very easy. Who is this for:Users who love a beautiful thermostat and already have Nest devices, but want something that will save them money with easy eco modes.Who shouldn’t buy it:Buyers who want to save on initial costs and aren't especially big fans of the Google Nest ecosystem.  ...

Photo Gallery 1/3
Most user-friendly smart thermostat
Sensi Touch 2
Pros
Simple, clean touchscreen interface
Quick setup
Alexa and Google compatibility
Affordable when on sale
Provides energy, equipment and maintenance reports
Cons
Lacks smart features like built-in presence sensing and learning capabilities
Why I like it:The Sensi Touch 2 is an excellent choice if you interact a lot with the physical thermostat. The app is good, and the thermostat is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, but the display on this one really shines. It’s simple, intuitive and clear, allowing you to easily make changes. Some other thermostats require you to know what the particular icon means, which can add to the learning curve, but this one is straightforward. Plus, the temperature setting is prominently displayed, and you can set a range of temperatures very easily with the tap of a finger.If you find the larger, flashier thermostat displays a bit overwhelming, Sensi's model may be a breath of cool air. While it's a bit more limited than some picks, it still works with Google and Alexa commands and provides alerts and reminders.Who is this for:Users look for a minimalist model with more traditional manual controls that still includes handy smart features like voice assistant support. Who shouldn’t buy it:People who want learning functions and advanced eco modes. plus more sensor options.

Best smart thermostat for whole-house control
Honeywell Home T10 Pro+ Smart Thermostat
Pros
Simple, effective controls and app
Easy setup
Satellite sensor options
Humidity and air quality sensors for air management
Cons
Making full use of this thermostat requires big investment in Resideo's ecosystem
Why I like it:The Honeywell Home T9 was a very nice thermostat that combined smart features with a traditional design, but the upgrades for the T10 truly impressed us. Installation remains simple, and you can largely avoid app use if you prefer to stick with onboard controls. However, smart features still abound, and the thermostat works with remote sensors for targeted heating. The T10 really shines when combined with compatible Resideo whole-house devices like the TrueDRY dehumidifier or F200 Media Air Cleaner. It can use its readings (with an added Equipment Interface Model) to automatically shut this air quality equipment on or off for increased comfort without manual adjustment or complex smart device workarounds -- as long as you're willing to make the investment.Who is this for:Users who like the idea of investing in whole-house humidity and air quality control tied to their thermostat.Who shouldn’t buy it:Users who don't really plan on investing in a bunch of Resideo home tech.  ...

Best budget smart thermostat
Ecobee Smart Thermostat Essential
Pros
Affordable at under $150
Keeps many of the best Ecobee features like auto-away mode
Streamlined for ease of use
Retains the stylish touchscreen
Cons
Users who want to pay under $100 will have to look elsewhere
Lacks more advanced sensors
Why I like it:While it's not quite as cheap as my Amazon pick, I still think the Ecobee Essential model is one of the best budget thermostats if you're willing to spend around $140 for one. While it doesn't have the Premium's extra sensor or wireless satellite sensor, it does come with all the learning functions, useful screen information and app controls you could want. Ecobee's compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google remains as well, so you have plenty of home control options. That makes this an excellent upgrade for those interested in a new thermostat but who would rather keep things simple while still getting lots of smart upgrades.Who is this for:Buyers looking for a more affordable, streamlined Ecobee thermostat with plenty of energy saving but no extras to worry about setting up.Who shouldn’t buy it:Buyers determined to spend less than $150 on a thermostat, users who want extra info about air quality or weather  ...

Other smart thermostats we've tested
GoogleCommercial Electric Smart Thermostat: Despite the name, this new offering from The Home Depot is a residential thermostat built to operate with the company’s Hubspace smart home platform, although it’ll work with Alexa and Google Home. It’s a fairly straightforward system that allows significant control but lacks truly smart features. My favorite feature is setting a schedule based on sunrise or sunset.Cync Smart Thermostat: This thermostat from GE Lighting, now owned by Savant which offers other home energy products such as solar batteries, offers good smart home interactions and the ability to buy an external sensor, but it lacked some of the more advanced features offered by other thermostats, while still costing more than the Amazon model.Nest Thermostat: The Nest Thermostat was a compelling choice at a mid-level price range ($205), but a few things held it back. For one, it lacks the intuitive interface and features of its smarter big sibling (the Nest Learning Thermostat), and it wants to use the Google Home app instead of the more intuitive and feature-rich Nest app used by the Learning model. The installation prompts send you straight into scheduling, so prepare for that.  Factors to consider when choosing a smart thermostat
Smart displays can control compatible thermostats with a touch. Google Nest/CNETWhen you’re shopping for a traditional standard thermostat, there isn’t much to consider. What does it look like? Can you program it? Does it have that cool old-fashioned dial? When shopping for a smart thermostat, there are a lot more options and some things one person may love while the next person may hate. Here’s what we think is important to consider. Smart home integrationSmart thermostats all come with some kind of app or option to control the device from your phone. If you have a particular affinity for one smart home family or another, you’ll want to make sure you’re getting a thermostat that will work in conjunction with your other devices. Most smart thermostats will take voice commands from Amazon’s Alexa, but if the rest of your home is running on, say, Apple’s HomeKit, not every device will provide support. Make sure you’re getting something that will play nice with the rest of your smart home.GeofencingFor the most part, your thermostat’s job is to keep your home comfortable. That means you don’t necessarily need it to be the perfect temperature when you aren’t home. Many smart thermostats feature geofencing, meaning they can track whether or not you’re home and set their expectations accordingly.Some devices track occupancy based on the phones of those in the household, while others combine that feature with other occupancy sensors. The good thing is that you can set limits around this feature: Do you want it to change the temperature when you’re away? How far away do you have to be for it to kick in? What temperature limits should there be if you aren’t home? The latter is important if you have pets. You don’t want the cats sweltering or freezing while you’re at work.How smart do you want your thermostat to be?Everyone wants a different level of control over their thermostat. Some people want to decide at every moment what the temperature should be. (In that case, you can also consider a basic Wi-Fi-enabled programmable thermostat like the Honeywell Home RTH6580WF, which doesn’t have as many smart features as its more expensive peers but can be adjusted from your phone.)Some smart thermostats can be too smart for their own good. One of the most common complaints I’ve heard is that some products will hold the temperature you set them to only for a little bit, and then they’ll revert to what the thermostat believes the temperature should be. If that would annoy you, focus on the ones that offer you the most control.
Taking a photo can take a lot of stress out of the thermostat installation process. Google NestInstallation and HVAC compatibilityRead my full guide on smart thermostat installation guide here.Not all thermostats are installed exactly the same way, but they’re all pretty similar. Expect to need a screwdriver, a pair of pliers capable of moving wires around and potentially a drill and a level. Installation is pretty simple once you’ve done it once or twice: Turn off the power, mark the wires, take off the old one, wire the new one and put the thermostat up. You’ll want to watch out for two potential complications: First, does your system have a C-wire? There are usually five or so wires that come out of your wall to connect a thermostat. The older wires tend to carry just enough electricity to power an old-school thermostat. Smarter devices, which can tell you the weather or maybe play your playlist and need an internet connection, need more power than that. This is achieved through a C-wire, designed to carry more electricity to the thermostat. Not every home is wired with one, but if you don’t have one, you have a couple of choices.The first is to get a thermostat that doesn’t require a C-wire. This is where the Nest thermostats are set apart because they’re capable of charging their batteries off the other wires. The second option is to install an adapter kit. This involves adding a device to your HVAC system that converts one of the existing wires into a C-wire. Fortunately, most smart thermostats we’ve looked at that require a C-wire come with these kits. If not, you can pick one up for under $25.The second installation complication is seeing if your thermostat requires any high-voltage wires. This is most common for thermostats that power older electric furnaces or electric baseboard heaters. Today's smart thermostats can support high voltage wiring or those heating devices until you upgrade your system. High-voltage wires are usually labeled and support current at 120 volts or more.
External sensorsYour thermostat knows what the temperature is because it has a thermometer inside of it. The device’s understanding of the temperature inside is usually limited to the temperature exactly where you mounted it to the wall. What about that stuffy bedroom?Many smart thermostats come with or are at least able to connect to separate room sensors. These room sensors allow you to train the thermostat to keep your house as comfortable as possible throughout the home. With external sensors, thermostats can target an individual room and get it to a comfortable temperature at a certain time (the bedroom at night, the home office during the day, etc.) or find a setting that makes everywhere as comfortable as possible, not just the room with the thermostat in it. Some even have proximity sensors in their room sensors, meaning they can tell when a room is occupied or not. How we test smart thermostats
Ecobee's thermostat with mounting plant on a wood table. Tyler Lacoma/CNETMost of the home energy products we test and evaluate here at CNET have a lot of numbers attached to them: the efficiency of solar panels and the power output of batteries. Not so with smart thermostats. All of these thermostats can perform the basic functions of turning your heater on when it’s cold and your AC on when it’s hot. Some of our scoring is based on tangible, mathematical data, but it’s mostly about the myriad ways you can interact with the thermostat to get the comfort level and energy savings you want.We’ve experimented, tested and handled each of the thermostats mentioned on this list, including installing them on a testing rig that simulates a standard HVAC system, programming them and trying their various features.
We used this rig, built by our CNET Labs engineers, to hook up a variety of thermostats to test their interfaces and apps. Adam Breeden/CNETThe 10-point scores we give smart thermostats are based on these metrics:20% is based on the available smart home connectivity and other features, including geofencing and external room sensors.20% is the price, with a formula that rewards less expensive products. Our methodology takes into account the price of any included room sensors.60% is completely subjective, based on our assessment of what the device offers, how easy it is to install, how easy the app or interface is to use and what features it has that might be non-standard for thermostats but helpful or useful for consumers.Choosing a thermostat is an incredibly subjective and personal choice, and our goal in scoring is to highlight those products that do the most and do them well. Your buying decision should focus on your priorities, which might not align exactly with ours, so be sure to look at more than just a score when choosing a device you will probably interact with almost every day. Smart thermostat privacy and security
Thermostat sensors can go anywhere to monitor specific temperatures. Google NestSince smart thermostats use a variety of sensors to monitor your activity, you may have privacy concerns. I dig deep into thermostat privacy in this guide, but the bottom line is that there isn't too much to worry about. Smart thermostats can't "watch" you or record video of your home, only get a broad sense of when people are moving around and when a house is still. Companies typically log data on how the thermostat and app are used, like when the thermostat begins an automatic temperature change and when it's manually altered. Thermostat brands use that info for product analysis as well as marketing efforts. Within limitations, they may give it to third parties if you consent. Remember, if you use a voice assistant, it's probably recording your temperature commands for later analysis unless you have voice assistant settings to turn that option off. What we've updated
Ecobee's temperature sensors also include presence sensing. EcobeeSpring 2025: I added the Ecobee Essential model as an excellent budgets option for those who want more features than the absolute cheapest thermostats, but still want to save a lot on initial costs. Also, I made sure that our Honeywell Home picked was the latest T10 version that integrates with Resideo whole-home air quality equipment.
Smart thermostat FAQ
How do I install a smart thermostat?
If you’ve ever installed a thermostat before, you can install a smart thermostat (provided your home has the right wiring). Every smart thermostat comes with installation instructions, whether in a printed pamphlet, on an app, or both. Essentially, the directions all boil down to: Shut off the circuit for your HVAC system and make sure the power is off by trying to turn the heat or air on.Remove your old thermostat, leaving the wires attached.Label the wires and/or take a picture of them so you know which is which.Disconnect the wires from your old thermostat.Prepare the back plate of the new thermostat and the wall plate, which can cover up the area around the thermostat installation, if you’re using it. Insert the wires into the back plate as the new thermostat directs.Mount the plates, attach the thermostat and turn the power back on.

Are smart thermostats really worth it?
They can be. A smart thermostat, if used correctly, can minimize your use of energy by running your HVAC system only when necessary. It might also be worth it by enabling you to have more control over the temperature in your home, including adjusting the temperature from your phone or by voice command.

Can a smart thermostat save you money?
That depends on how much energy it actually saves. If the smart thermostat results in you using less energy to heat and cool your home, that’s savings. Considering that heating and cooling is by far the biggest use of energy in American homes, the savings could be significant. You can also save money by participating in programs like a virtual power plant, which could give you credits in exchange for a little bit of control when the grid needs it. If your energy habits don’t change, you might just have a more expensive gadget to go with the same energy bills.

What do you need to know before you buy a smart thermostat?
The most important thing you need to know is why you’d get one and what your goals would be. A smart thermostat can be a valuable tool, but if you’re just going to turn the dial on it to change the temperature, it might not be worth it. Make sure you know what you’re looking to get out of it, whether that’s energy savings, smart home integration or just a better understanding of your energy consumption.You also need to know whether your HVAC system is compatible with the thermostat you want. Most manufacturers have a guide to see if it will work. The third thing: Know if your HVAC system has a C-wire installed, although that’s not necessarily a deal-breaker.

Who should purchase a smart thermostat?
If you’re looking to take more control over your energy use, a smart thermostat could be a big part of that. You should also consider one if you hate having to change the temperature setting often, or if you frequently need to do so from the other side of the house.

What about privacy and security?
As with anything “smart” these days, there are some risks and concerns about the privacy and security of the information these devices collect and share. Consider the company’s data collection and sharing policies and weigh them against your personal preferences. Smart thermostats will generally collect data about how they're used along with how the app is used, but this doesn't usually include especially sensitive information.

Can I get a smart thermostat if I don't have a C-wire?
You can. There are a couple of ways to go about it. One is to install a C-wire adapter, which many smart thermostats come with. This will require some wiring work at the HVAC unit, but it will allow you to run a smart thermostat.Aside from that option, there are some smart thermostats that can run without a C-wire: the Nest products. Of these, the Nest Learning Thermostat, while pricier, was one of our favorites.
