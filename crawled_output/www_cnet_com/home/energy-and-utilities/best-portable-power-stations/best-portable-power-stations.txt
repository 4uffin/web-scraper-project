How we test
What to Consider
Capacity
This is really the main point of a portable power station. How many times can you recharge that phone? Or how long will that light run?
Charging Outputs
So many to choose from... AC receptacles, USB ports, wireless charging, RV connector... make sure it has what you need!
Charging Inputs
Other than the main AC charging via receptacle, some people specifically need DC charging on the road or solar panel charging (check the input watts here).
Features
Once all your basic criteria are met, check out the nice-to-haves. Ability to add additional batteries? Modular pieces to spread around your power?

Power outages can be inconvenient, especially in the summer. If you live in an area where this is common, having a backup power source can be a lifesaver. And while a traditional generator can be expensive, a power station is an affordable alternative. It'll help you stay powered during a power outage and double as a great add-on to your camping gear.

With that said, not all power stations are created equal. Some models are large and powerful enough to run a refrigerator for days, while others are designed for portability, offering just enough juice to keep your mobile devices charged for a few hours.After testing over 140 power stations and evaluating charging options, capacity, charge time and other features, we've narrowed down our top picks that can serve your needs, ranging from portability to whole home backup.Which is the best overall portable power station?After countless hours of testing, our CNET experts found the clear answer to which portable power station is the best -- the $2,199 Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus. Jackery's offerings have never failed us in the portable power station arena, and this one is certainly no exception with its incredible features such as wireless charging and compatibility with solar panels. What set the Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus apart was the ability to expand it by adding external batteries, increasing its overall capacity and capabilities, although competitors like EcoFlow, Anker and others now boast this feature as well.

Best overall portable power station
Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus
Pros
Tested 88% usable capacity (better than industry average)
Charges via solar (1,400-watt input) or AC in under 2 hours
Highly expandable capacity, scalable up to an impressive 24kWh
Powerful 3000W output (6000W surge) capable of running heavy-load devices and appliances
Cons
Expensive at $2,000 compared with similar-capacity models
No wireless charging
Best for: The Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus is ideal for homeowners, RV enthusiasts and off-grid adventurers who need reliable, expandable power. With its 2,042.8Wh capacity (expandable to 5kWh with extra batteries), it can keep essential appliances running during outages or power a weekend camping trip with ease. The balance of capacity, charging speed and portability makes it the most versatile option for people who want one power station to handle multiple scenarios.Why we recommend it: In our testing, the Jackery 2000 Plus delivered an impressive 88.13% of its rated capacity, higher than many competitors in its class. It charges fully in just under 2 hours via AC or solar, and its 3,000-watt pure sine wave inverter safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or laptops. The built-in MPPT solar controller optimizes off-grid charging, and the sturdy design holds up to rugged outdoor use. For those who need dependable power without compromise, this is the best all-around choice.The power station comes with a telescoping handle and durable wheels. You'll also notice the inclusion of a round RV-type AC output rated at 25 amps. What's more, if you'd like to pick up two of these, you can use the new Jackery expansion connector to link up both units and supply yourself with two separate 240-volt outlets (each rated 30 amps). We've seen this from a few other manufacturers, but I'm happy to see Jackery doing this early in the game. Similarly, Jackery has thrown in on the modular game by offering external expansion batteries. For now, the 2000 Plus is the only unit that'll accept these batteries, but we can assume more are to follow. Each external battery has the same capacity as the base 2000 Plus unit, and currently, you can link up to five additional batteries to the main unit for a staggering 12,256.8Wh. Additionally, you can still combine two sets of the six-piece combos for that 240-volt capability and an even larger capacity of 24,513.6Wh. For these reasons and more, the Jackery 2000 Plus is our top pick for both the best large and best overall portable power station.Who shouldn't buy it: Budget-conscious buyers should consider smaller models like the EcoFlow River 3, as the Jackery 2000 Plus commands a premium price at $2,199 without any sales. Its 61.5-pound weight also makes it less suitable for backpacking compared with ultraportable options like the Bluetti Handsfree 2. If you need only short-term power for small devices, this unit’s capacity may be overkill.  ... Show more

Most versatile
Jackery Explorer 1000 Plus
Pros
Excellent balance of capacity (1,264Wh), power output (2,000 watts), and manageable portability for its class &nbsp;
Rapid AC wall charging (100 minutes to full) and efficient solar charging (800W input)
Quiet operation, with noise levels not exceeding 30dB during charging&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Cons
On the heavier side for capacity
May not work best for high power appliances
Best for: The Jackery Explorer 1000 Plus is an excellent choice for people who require more than 1kWh of power but not the immense capacity (or cost and weight) of larger whole-home backup systems. It is well-suited for RV enthusiasts, van lifers and outdoor adventurers who need to power more demanding devices or multiple items simultaneously. Its expandability also makes it a good option for those who anticipate their power needs growing over time.  Why we recommend it: The Explorer 1000 Plus is a versatile midrange option, with its 1.26kWh initial capacity, robust 2,000-watt continuous output, and, critically, the ability to expand up to 5kWh. These features give it a lot of versatility, from extended camping trips to reliable backup for essential home devices. You can charge via a wall outlet in about 1.5 hours -- or double that time if you opt for the 1000 Plus’ 800-watt solar charging input. Tested capacity is solid at 79.97%, which tends to be average for power stations. The fast AC and solar charging capabilities, coupled with the longevity and safety of its LiFePO4 battery, are significant strengths. For most people who need serious power, modular is the way to go. Jackery's lineup continues to impress us with its full suite of expandable products.  Who shouldn't get it: If you're on a very tight budget, you may want a cheaper, lower capacity option like the 286Wh EcoFlow River 3 Plus. It may also not be the best choice for people needing to run very large, power-hungry appliances (like central air conditioners) for multiple days without any opportunity for recharging.    ...

Best fast charging portable power station
Bluetti AC70
Pros
Very fast Turbo AC charging (950-watt input, 80% in 45 minutes, full charge in approximately 1.5 hours) &nbsp;
Power Lifting Mode can draw high-draw resistive devices up to 2,000 watts&nbsp;
Good solar input capacity (up to 500 watts) can recharge in 2 to 3 hours
UPS with a 20ms switchover time&nbsp;
Cons
Number of USB ports limited compared with competitors&nbsp;
Can't be recharged via a USB-C input
Who it's best for: The Bluetti AC70 is well-suited for anyone who needs quick recharges and has variable power needs. Its "Power Lifting Mode" makes it particularly useful for those who might occasionally need to power simple high-wattage resistive appliances like hairdryers, electric kettles or small heaters without investing in a much larger unit. Its portability also makes it a good grab-and-go power source.  Why we recommend it: This station has 768Wh of capacity, and is currently on sale for $359 for Prime members. (We tested this unit to have about 93% of that capacity as usable. Anything over 90% is excellent.) It also has a rated power output of 1,000 watts (2,000 peak) and promises to charge to 80% in 45 minutes. The Bluetti AC70's standout features are its impressive 950-watt Turbo Charging, which can replenish 80% of its battery in just 45 minutes, and the innovative 2000W Power Lifting mode for handling specific high-draw resistive loads. In our charge tests, we found that in turbo charge mode, the AC70 hits that 80% charge even faster, at just 33 minutes. These capabilities, combined with a durable LiFePO4 battery, a respectable 500-watt solar input, and useful features like UPS mode and app control, make it a highly versatile and usable power station in its category. It also has a UPS switchover of 20ms, though we recommend you check any essential medical equipment if you plan to use this as a backup power source -- some devices require switchover times below 12ms.All in all, this is a great package with a low price tag, which makes it a perfect budget option.Who shouldn't get it: If you need to continuously run sensitive high-wattage electronics or motor-driven appliances above its 1,000-watt rated output, look for a unit with a higher continuous power rating. People who heavily rely on USB-C for recharging the power station itself will find its absence a letdown.

Best small portable power station
EcoFlow River 3
Pros
Extremely lightweight and compact, making it highly portable for various activities
Very fast 1-hour AC charging from 0% to 100%
Reliable UPS capability with a quick switchover time, protecting sensitive devices
Includes a powerful 100W USB-C Power Delivery port for fast-charging compatible devices&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Cons
The 245Wh capacity can't power high-wattage appliances
Only two AC outlets, with one being a two-prong outlet, which may limit connectivity for some devices &nbsp;
No built-in LED light, a common emergency feature on many portable power stations &nbsp;
Who it's best for: The EcoFlow River 3 is an ideal companion for digital nomads, students, photographers and anyone needing a highly portable solution to power or charge laptops, smartphones, cameras, drones and other small electronic devices on the go. Its UPS feature also makes it suitable for providing emergency power to essential low-wattage devices like Wi-Fi routers or CPAP machines (provided their power draw is within limits). At just $239 at full price, it's also incredibly affordable. Why we recommend it: There's a lot to like in this small, reasonably priced package. The River 3 weighs just 7.8 pounds and measures 10 by 8.3 by 4.4 inches. Perhaps more impressively, it comes with 90% usable capacity out of the box, with the ability to charge to full in an hour. It's not shy on ports or features either, with two AC ports, one car port output, a USB-C output and two USB-A ports. Like many portable power stations today, it supports solar panel charging, generator hookups, and car battery recharging -- making it a great option for camping as well.EcoFlow also says devices drawing less than 100 watts will get double the battery life. It includes UPS capability with a switchover time of under 20 milliseconds, which should be sufficient for most electronics -- except highly sensitive devices like PCs or medical equipment. I also like the screen, which lets you monitor charging output and battery capacity at a glance. For this much power in such a small package, the River 3 is hard to beat. Who shouldn't get it: The River 3 isn't a great option if you need to run appliances such as mini-fridges, coffee makers, heaters or power tools, as its 300-watt output and 245Wh capacity will be insufficient. Those requiring multiple grounded AC outlets or significantly longer runtimes for their devices should consider larger and more powerful models.  ... Show more

DJI
Best for drones
DJI Power 500
Pros
Extremely fast AC charging: 100% in 70 minutes, 80% in 50 minutes
Ultra-quiet operation during recharge (approx. 25 dB)
Specialized fast-charging capability for select DJI drone batteries
Reliable UPS mode with a rapid 0.02-second switchover time &nbsp;
&nbsp;
Cons
Solar and car charging cables and adapters are not included
Capacity is relatively small for users with extensive power needs
&nbsp;
Best for: The DJI Power 500 is an excellent choice for DJI drone operators seeking a fast and reliable field charging solution. It's also well-suited for photographers, videographers and content creators who need to quickly recharge camera batteries, laptops and other essential gear on location. People who prioritize extremely quiet operation, such as those using it indoors or in noise-sensitive camping environments, will appreciate its low decibel rating. Its rapid recharge capability also makes it ideal for individuals who need quick power top-ups for smaller devices and can't afford long downtimes.  Why we recommend it: With DJI’s fast-charging technology, Power 500 gets you back to 100% power in just 70 minutes or, if you’re in a rush to get out, charged to 80% in just 50 minutes. The dual 100-watt USB-C two-way ports can provide separate power supplies to two devices, such as cameras, phones and laptops. Certified by five SGS noise tests, the DJI Power operates at 25 decibels, as quiet as a whisper. Tested capacity came out to a solid 79.66%, which tends to be the average for many power stations we've tested. The ultra-quiet 25dB operation during recharging is another major advantage, ensuring minimal disturbance. Coupled with robust safety mechanisms, a durable LFP battery, and a useful UPS mode, it presents a compelling package for its target audience. The growing consumer demand for less intrusive technology, especially for indoor or serene outdoor settings, makes its quietness a key differentiator.  With a 512-watt-hour capacity and 1,000-watt output, the DJI Power 500 all-scenario portable power station can serve as an essential backup power source during emergencies, especially for road trippers and content creators. Who shouldn't get it: If you need a power station to run high-wattage appliances (like microwaves or large power tools) for extended periods, its capacity will be insufficient. Those looking for a solution with a very large battery capacity without needing to purchase multiple units should explore larger models, including the Jackery Explorer 1000 Plus. Budget-conscious individuals should also factor in the additional cost of solar or car charging accessories if those are required.  ... Show more

Best power station for camping
Bluetti Handsfree 2 Backpack Power Station
Pros
All-in-one integrated design combining a power station with a functional backpack
Good capacity (512Wh) and output (700W continuous, 1200W) &nbsp;
Fast AC charging (600W input, 80% in 45 minutes) and efficient solar charging (350W input, full in 2 hours) &nbsp;
Cons
Combined weight of the power station and backpack when fully loaded with gear is 45-50 pounds
Weight, might feel unbalanced for some users, particularly hiking on uneven terrain
Who it's best for: The Bluetti Handsfree 2 Backpack is tailor-made for outdoor photographers, videographers, drone pilots, hikers, mountaineers and any adventurer who needs a truly mobile, hands-free power source for their electronic gear in remote locations. It excels in scenarios where setting down a traditional power station is impractical or inefficient.  Why we recommend it:The Bluetti Handsfree 2 is one of the most unique power stations we've tested at CNET's lab. It's half a portable power station and half a backpack. Yes, it's very niche in terms of form factor, but if you're hiking, it's hard to beat a backpack-based setup since you'll likely be carrying one anyway. The power station itself has a 700-watt AC output, two USB-C and two USB-A charging ports, and it can charge up to five devices simultaneously. The backpack is IPX4 water-resistant and can carry a load of 66 pounds. The 512-watt-hour battery is enough to keep you going for a while, and it comes with 87% usable capacity, which is pretty good. You can even pair it with a 100-watt portable solar panel and solar generator to further extend your options. (You can buy this as a bundle, too.) The entire power station can be charged to 100% in a little over 1 hour. The 60-liter backpack is designed with camera users in mind. Its main compartment fits a camera body, multiple lenses, charging packs and accessories while still leaving space for clothing, a laptop or iPad and other essentials -- perfect for the roving photojournalist in you.Who shouldn't get it:If you don't require a backpack-integrated power solution or need to power higher capacity devices in a fixed location, Fossibot and Anker may have more suitable solutions. It may not also be the most balanced weight while hiking when fully loaded.  ... Show more

Best for whole-home backup
Anker Solix F3800 Plus
Pros
3840Wh base capacity with expandability up to 26.9kWh with one unit, or 53.8kWh with two units and 12 expansion batteries &nbsp;
Extremely high 6,000-watt continuous AC output with dual-voltage (120/240 volts) &nbsp;
Solar input capacity of up to 3,200 watts for very fast off-grid recharging (100% in as little as 1.5 hours) &nbsp;
Impressive five-year warranty
Cons
Extremely heavy at 136.7 pounds
Home Power Panel is required for some of the most advanced features, like automatic home backup and local energy saving
Who it's best for:The Anker Solix F3800 Plus is designed for homeowners seeking a premium, highly capable, and massively expandable whole-home backup power system. It is also an excellent solution for people living off-grid with significant power demands, or those who wish to maximize solar energy utilization. EV owners will appreciate its direct EV charging capability as a backup or supplementary power source.Why we recommend it: The Anker Solix F3800 Plus stands as one of the most powerful and versatile "portable" (wheeled) energy solutions currently available, offering capabilities that rival those of permanently installed home battery systems like the Tesla Powerwall. Its 3,200-watt solar input, 6,000-watt dual-voltage output, massive expandability options and intelligent features such as Storm Guard (when paired with the Home Power Panel ) make it a top-tier choice for achieving serious energy independence and comprehensive backup power. The increased solar input over its predecessor is a significant upgrade, so it's an even better option for off-grid power than the F3800. CNET contributor Adam Doud put it to the test in his home, trying it with a variety of high-power devices. "The F3800 Plus powered my refrigerator for 12 hours, the longest time I got from my devices and appliances," Doud said. "This was followed by my Hisense 65-inch U8K TV, which the Solix F3800 Plus kept running for another 7 hours." He also tried it with a clothes dryer, reporting, "You can probably expect to get about eight cycles out of the portable power station -- handy if you have a long power outage and need to dry clothes for your whole family." It offers versatile direct EV and RV charging via dedicated NEMA ports, intelligent app control with features like Storm Guard for proactive emergency preparedness, and is built around robust EV-class LFP batteries designed for a long lifespan.Who shouldn't get it: The F3800 Plus is wasted on anyone who doesn't need its huge capacity or expansion capabilities. If all you need is a genuinely lightweight, easily carried unit for camping or frequent transport, there are more portable picks from Jackery, EcoFlow, Bluetti and others.  ... Show more

Very fast recharging options: AC (2,200 watts), solar (2,000 watts) and combined AC+Solar (up to 4,200 watts)
Often priced more affordably than competitors.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Cons
Extremely heavy, with the main unit weighing 92.59 pounds
Two-year warranty is shorter than competitors &nbsp;
Best for:The Fossibot F3600 Pro is an outstanding choice for homeowners seeking substantial and expandable backup power capable of running an entire house during outages, particularly those in areas with frequent power cuts or high-peak electricity. The F3600 Pro's price and capacity earn it a place on this list. This portable power bank is usually listed at $2,699, but frequent sales can make it an even more attractive option. As of writing, it's currently $1,299.Why we recommend it: Fossibot isn't a household name, but that doesn't stop it from being a great value option for those looking for an extra-large power station for home backup. This power station comes with a massive 3,840Wh capacity, putting it in the same size category as the Anker Solix F3800. Measured capacity works out to 89%, which is fairly solid and helps it beat out the Solix, which managed only 79%. In charging speed, the F3800 has the edge, reaching a full charge in under 3 hours, compared with the F3600 Pro, which takes 5 hours and 32 minutes to fully recharge.Other capabilities are impressive. The F3600 Pro comes with a mix of USB-A, USB-C, AC and DC ports, letting it power up to 15 devices at the same time with a maximum output of 3,600 watts. You can pair it with up to two expansion batteries, giving you a potential total capacity of up to 11.52Wh, though that's less than the six batteries the F3800 can take. It can also be paired with solar panels for recharging and supports car and generator charging. UPS functionality is built-in, with a 10-millisecond switchover and monitoring via an app that connects to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.Who shouldn't get it: This power station won't be the best option for portability or light-duty use. It also takes up a lot of space. Finally, if you want better (five-year) warranty support and more expansion options, the Solix F3800 Plus remains the better option for the capacity.  ... Show more

Slower charging to full than River 3
Best for: The Oupes Mega 1 is an excellent choice for those seeking a high-value, expandable 1kWh portable power station that doesn't skimp on charging speed or output power. It's well-suited for RVers, campers and for providing home backup for essential devices. Its combination of features and performance at its price makes it attractive to budget-conscious consumers who still want robust capabilities.Why we recommend it: This is the smallest of the Oupes Mega series lineup, but that doesn't make it the least. For starters, it has a 95% measured usable capacity, notably higher than many other similarly size portable power stations. It charges to full in just over 1.5 hours, which isn't as fast as the River 3, but still fairly impressive for the size. You get a total of 13 outputs, with four AC ports capable of 2,000 watts output, two USB-C ports (100 watts), four USB-A ports (18 watts), one car outlet (120 watts) and two DC 5521 ports. It also supports 20 recharging with solar panels and has a 20-millisecond UPS switchover for more sensitive devices.The Oupes Mega 1 packs a significant punch with its 2,000 watts continuous output, a 1,024Wh LiFePO4 battery that can be expanded to over 5kWh and exceptionally fast charging capabilities, including a 1-hour full recharge using combined AC and solar input. The rich feature set, which includes 13 output ports, smart app control and UPS functionality, all offered at a competitive price, gives it great value in the mid-capacity portable power station market.Who shouldn't get it: The Mega 1 is a capable portable power station, but if portability is your most important factor, we like the EcoFlow River 3 for the compact size and faster charging to full.  ...

How we test portable power stations
Currently, we look at two main performance metrics for portable power stations: charge time and discharge capacity. Every company that sells portable power stations provides the expected number of watt-hours its products are supposed to last. That can vary from as low as 240 watt hours to as many as 2,000 watt hours for a larger power station. That means if you run a device with a 1-watt output on a power station with 240Wh, it should last for about 240 hours. On a 2,000Wh power station, you'd get an impressive 2,000 hours. That would last you almost three months. For reference, a USB-C iPhone charger draws up to 18 watts, a 3-quart Instant Pot draws 700 watts and a standard microwave draws around 600 to 1,200 watts, depending on the model.
We use 110-watt LED lights to run a controlled load on each power station during our tests, which allows us to calculate the percentage of power that you can actually use. Ry Crist/CNETUsable capacityA power station's capacity should be a no-brainer. You should be able to look at a device's rated watt-hours and purchase accordingly based on your needs. Generally, you can do that. I've found that you typically won't see the entire capacity rating as usable power.Lots of factors can affect this, and most of them center on how the manufacturer chooses to build its units' internals to manage their charged capacity. There is some (usually negligible) amount of power that goes to fuel the various indicator lights and readable LED panels on the units. Some of the larger units even have their own operating systems, so it's almost like powering an additional mini PC on the inside. Other units can have power-saving features where they reduce outgoing bulk power as they come close to depleting their charge.
We use external tools alongside each unit's own built-in meters to measure the outgoing voltage and watts of each power station we test. Ry Crist/CNETTo run our capacity tests, we connect several 10,000-lumen LED work lights, rated at 110 watts, to each unit. (The number of work lights is based on the overall watt-hour rating of the unit under test, or UUT.) We record the outgoing voltage and wattage using external measurement instruments or the UUT's own measurements if available. Once we have this data, we can leverage the calculations into a dizzying array of information about the UUT's performance. The main piece of information we look at here is the observed capacity, based on our measurements, compared to the UUT's stated capacity. Here's that mass of data in a nifty chart, where longer bars indicate power stations with greater percentages of battery capacity that you can put to use. In every case, that percentage ends up at less than 100%. Most manufacturers say you should calculate expected usage at 85% of the stated capacity. Generally, we consider anything above 80% to be a good capacity, with anything below 70% being subpar.
How long does it take to charge each of these things from zero to 100%? Glad you asked! Ry Crist/CNETCharge timeCharging performance can be nearly as important as knowing your capacity stats. It helps to know how long your device will take to charge, especially if you're crunched for time or need to be able to charge quickly for whatever reason. We report three data points for charging performance. Each unit is plugged in for AC charging and we record how long it takes to reach 50%, 80% and 100% charge. Half-full is probably the least amount of power you're going to want, especially from the smaller units. 80% is the "magic number" for many rechargeable batteries.
Take a look at the full charge test results below. Charge times are listed in hours, so shorter bars indicate power stations that charge faster. In many cases, you can see how the charge rate is fairly constant between 0% and 50% (red) and from 50% to 80% (yellow), before slowing down from 80% to 100% (green).
Factors to consider when purchasing a portable power station
The two most critical specifications are capacity, measured in watt-hours, and output, measured in watts. Watt-hours indicate the total amount of energy stored, akin to the size of a fuel tank; it determines how long the power station can run connected devices.For instance, a 700Wh station was observed to keep a refrigerator running for 14.5 hours in one scenario. Watts, on the other hand, represent the rate at which power can be delivered, similar to an engine's power; this dictates which devices, and how many, can be run simultaneously. It's important to distinguish between rated (continuous) wattage and surge (peak) wattage, the latter being a short burst of higher power needed to start some appliances. A common guideline is to calculate expected energy usage at about 85% of a power station's stated capacity to account for conversion losses.
Getty ImagesIf you need a portable power station consider the devices you intend to power, note their individual wattage requirements (usually found on the device label), and estimate the desired runtime to select an appropriately sized unit.Here are the all the key factors you'll want to look at when deciding on a portable power station. Size: Portable power stations come in a wide array of sizes and capacities, from the small and compact EcoFlow River 3, to the more capacious Anker Solix F3800, which stretches the limits of the word "portable," despite coming with wheels. The smaller power stations may be better for camping, digital nomads and those on the go, while the extra-large ones are best for folks who want home backup power. There is an inherent trade-off in portable power stations: higher capacity and greater power output generally result in increased weight and larger physical dimensions.Capacity: Capacity is measured in watt-hours, giving you a sense of the energy stored and how long a power station can run connected devices.Output: Output is the other piece of the puzzle here, measured in watts. You'll want to consider what you need to run. If you simply top off some phones and laptops, the smaller portable power stations that have just one or two AC outlets and a handful of USB-C and USB-A ports should be enough for you. If you want to run more demanding appliances like microwaves, toasters and air fryers, you'll need something with more juice, like the Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus.Ports: The number and type of output ports are significant. We look for a sufficient array of AC outlets (grounded, and sometimes specialized like NEMA TT-30P for RVs 16), USB-A ports (ideally with Quick Charge 3.0), high-power USB-C Power Delivery ports (60 watts or 100 watts for laptops and other devices) and DC/car accessory outlets.UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): This feature allows the power station to act as a backup, automatically switching to battery power within milliseconds (e.g., <10ms or 20ms) if grid power fails, thus protecting sensitive electronics like computers, modems, or medical devices from data loss or interruption.App Control: Many modern units offer Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity, enabling remote monitoring of battery status, power usage, and adjustment of settings via a smartphone application.Expandability: The option to add external battery packs to increase total energy storage is a valuable feature for future-proofing and adapting to growing needs, as seen in models from Jackery, Anker, Fossibot, and Oupes.Recharging: AC wall charging is often the fastest method for many units, with some models like the DJI Power 500 achieving a full charge in 70 minutes and the EcoFlow River 3 in just 1 hour. Solar charging is a key feature for off-grid use. Some advanced models, like the Fossibot F3600 Pro 15 and Oupes Mega 1 38, support combined charging, using both AC and solar inputs simultaneously for the fastest possible recharge times.Convenience Features: Built-in LED lights for illumination or emergency signaling, and wireless charging pads for compatible smartphones, add to user convenience.

AnkerAnker Solix F3800: The capacity and capabilities of portable power stations continue to evolve, with the largest models being capable of home backup and running high-power appliances. The Anker Solix F3800 is one such portable power station, with plenty of juice and the ability to run just about anything in your home, making it more similar to whole-home backup systems like the EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra and Tesla Powerwall. It's also worth noting that the F3800 has a successor -- the F3800 Plus, which now takes our top spot for extra-large power stations and home backup. There are a few things I am particularly fond of with the F3800. For starters, you can add up to six expansion batteries for a total of 26.9Wh capacity. The Solix F3800 boasts a nominal power output of 6,000 watts and the capacity for 120/240 split-phase output in the same unit. It also has both NEMA 14-50 and L14-30 receptacles to directly charge things like your EV, RV or large appliances. You could also choose to pull double duty, run two of these units and max out the expansion batteries for a total of 53.8kWh capacity. Doing so would double your power output to 12,000 watts. It's no slouch in testing either, with a reasonable 79% usable measured capacity and the ability to charge to full in under 3 hours. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity allow for monitoring energy use through the app, which is a nice touch. It comes with a generous five-year warranty, which is notably longer than the other extra-large portable power station on this list, the Fossibot F3600 Pro.Anker 555 PowerHouse (1,024Wh) (Update: Currently unavailable): An increasing number of portable power stations are shipping with LifePO4 batteries, and I love that. The 555 is slower to charge than most of its competitors but sports a 94% usable capacity and an attractive price versus the number of watt-hours; the better to power those six AC outlets. Anker Solix C1000 (1,056Wh): Another good option from Anker. It tested well in our lab and comes with a built-in LED light which is a nice touch for emergencies. Anker currently has it at almost half off and supports a five-year warranty, making it a great option when it's on sale. Anker Solix C800 Plus (768Wh): So, I kind of like this guy. It only really performed average in our standard tests for power stations, but it has a feature that is quite interesting, if not a bit gimmicky. In a storage compartment on top of the unit, you will find a telescoping pole that can be mounted onto the power station to support one of two rechargeable camping lights. You're not getting a ton of light out of these things, but, some light is infinitely better than no light. Plus you get the hands-free mode with the telescoping pole mount -- maybe that is what the 'plus' is for?Anker Solix F1200 (1,229Wh): This unit was previously known as the PowerHouse 757 from Anker, and was also CNET's previous pick for "best portable power station for backup." Its UPS mode was one of the earlier units to boast "less than 20ms" switchover time in the event of a power outage. It's also currently $500 off on Anker's site.  Anker Solix F2000 (2,048Wh): Previously known as the Anker PowerHouse 767 and previous winner of "best large portable power station" here on CNET. This model has lots to offer by way of features and options -- pretty much anything other than wireless charging. It also performed well on our usable capacity and charge time tests. It's now been supplanted by the Solix F3800 Plus. BioliteBioLite BaseCharge 600+ (622Wh): BioLite has released upgraded versions of its BaseCharge 600 and 1500 models. There's a little give and take here -- the upgraded units charge a bit faster, but have a little less usable capacity. Still, just an 'OK' pick.BioLite BaseCharge 1500+ (1,521Wh): Having tested both the 600 and 1500 models of the upgraded BioLite BaseCharge+ line, I can tell you that this company is consistent in its product manufacturing. The BaseCharge 1500+ is about 2.5 times the capacity of the 600+. That 2.5 modifier carries across the board fairly accurately from price to capacity, charge times and everything else. If you like the 600+, but you wish you had two and a half of it, save yourself the effort and just buy the 1500+. BluettiBluetti AC180 (1,152Wh): This unit tested well enough, scoring 88% usable capacity and charging via AC outlet at 13.88 watt-hours per minute. But unlike many of the other Bluetti units that use the same physical format, this unit does not support capacity expansion via external batteries. Bluetti AC180T (1,433Wh): I like this unit, but I'm just as, if not more, excited about its energy platform: the SwapSolar Ecosystem. Not unlike some of the Runhood units we've tested, this ecosystem uses interchangeable batteries that'll power multiple products from the brand. We have also tested an electric cooler on the same ecosystem. As far as large power stations, the performance metrics were great with this unit, just not quite enough to capture a title. Bluetti AC2A (204.8Wh): A great option if you don't need a ton of capacity but do need options beyond just USB connectivity. This unit is in the capacity ballpark of a very large power bank and priced similarly. Plus, it's currently on sale through the manufacturer for $149.Bluetti AC200P (2,000Wh): This is one of Bluetti's earlier large portable power stations and a previous winner for "best large portable power station." It's $400 off on Bluetti's site. It still offers plenty of power and options, but is likely nearing the end of its product cycle lifespan (hence the discount).  Bluetti AC 200 Max (2,048 Wh) (Update: Out of stock): The AC200 Max once held our title for the best value portable power station, giving you a 2,048 watt-hours of capacity (expandable to 8,192Wh), 2,200-watt output (4,800-watt surge) and 900 watts of solar charging power (1,400-watt solar plus AC). That's nothing to laugh at in this price range. Most offerings with similar specs sit closer to $2,000 and often are missing the expandability aspect. The AC200 Max is comparable in form to Bluetti's larger format AC300 and AC500 units. Bluetti AC240 (1,536Wh): I've tested a dozen or more Bluetti power stations at this point. The AC240 is good, as are most of Bluetti's offerings, but I wasn't particularly blown away and didn't find anything new to be excited about here. It performed slightly below many other Bluetti units on the usable capacity test but has many of the expandability options I admire, and UPS switchover times are coming down across the board -- 15ms on this unit, although I'll be happier when sub-12ms is the standard. Bluetti EB3A (268Wh): If you're interested in something small to work for your personal charging needs but those pocket-sized battery packs just don't cut it, this could be your option. As a previous CNET best value winner, the EB3A has what you need to keep rocking for a couple of days.  Bluetti EB55 (537Wh): We've liked almost every unit from Bluetti, and three of them took previous titles in this best list, but this unit was overshadowed by its siblings. Offerings that are just as good or better at better prices keep the EB55 out of the winner's circle. BougeBougeRV Fort 1000 (1,120Wh): I'm a fan of BougeRV's approach to camping and outdoor products in this space. It's worth checking out, especially if you're looking for more flexibility in areas like solar panels or DIY options. The Fort 1000 did well in our tests but didn't stand out enough to capture any titles.  BougeRV Flash 300 (286Wh) (Update: Out of stock): Another one bites the dust. Once our top pick for the best small portable power station, it came with 600 watts of power, supported wireless charging and could charge to 100% in 45 minutes. EcoFlowEcoFlow River Max (576Wh) (Update: Currently unavailable): Blazing fast charging and a low-cost per watt-hour make this a reasonable pick, although this unit did test lowest in measured versus expected capacity, putting it at 425 usable watt-hours. Where'd those extra 151 watt-hours go? Ecoflow River 2 Pro: A previous title holder for "best budget portable power station," this is still a great pick for anyone looking for affordable power options. It charges fully in just over 1 hour and accesses a respectable 82.6% of the battery's 768Wh stated capacity.EcoFlow Delta 2 (1,024Wh): The EcoFlow Delta 2 is similar to the Anker 555 PowerHouse across the board -- features, pricing and so on. The main differences you can see from our tests are the usable capacity percentages: Anker with 94% versus EcoFlow with about 70% and charging rates. Both are rated at 1,024Wh. The EcoFlow Delta 2 charged to full in only 86 minutes, 275 minutes faster than the Anker model. Another point for EF is that it can wire in a secondary battery module, taking the capacity from 1,024Wh to 2,048Wh. Expect to pay an additional $300 for that battery expansion.  EcoFlow Delta 2 Max (2,048Wh): Another example of a great product that didn't capture any of our titles. The Delta 2 Max performed well in all of our tests, and with the ability to expand to 6.144kWh, you're really walking the line between a portable power station and a whole-home energy solution.  EcoFlow Delta Mini (882Wh) (Update: Out of stock): When we tested it, this model hit a sweet spot of basic functionality, capacity and price, earning it a spot on our list as the best portable power station for camping. It also supported charging with solar panels. Unfortunately, it's no longer available for sale. EcoFlow Delta Pro (3,600Wh): The EcoFlow Delta Pro is one of the largest portable power stations on our list at 3.6kWh (expandable up to 25kWh), and also happens to be one of the fastest charging. Lots of power and plenty of charge options to keep that power rolling.JackeryJackery Explorer 240 (240Wh): We've been fans of all the Jackery units we've ever tested in the past, and that doesn't change here. Just missing the best small power station title, this unit still boasts the second-best capacity rating of all the ones we tested. It was a little slow to charge but is offered at a great price. Jackery Explorer 300 Plus (288Wh): Another nice entry into the platform, the 300 Plus offers a solid power option in small form. Not a ton of frills, but it does what you expect it to do. Jackery Explorer 700 Plus (680.96Wh): If you need more power output than the 300 Plus (300-watt/600-watt) then the 1,000-watt (2,000-watt surge) of the 700 Plus may be what you're looking for. It will charge via AC in about 1 hour and 30 minutes, and it has one of Jackery's higher usable capacity percentages at 88%. Jackery Explorer 1000 Pro (1,002Wh): The 1000 Pro falls into our large portable power station, which begins at 1,000Wh (this Jackery weighs in at 1,002Wh; the same as its big brother, the 2000 Pro). I like the 2000 more than the 1000 for a few reasons, so the 1000 never had a shot at taking the "large" category. But it still has good performance, nice features and amazing charge times. Jackery Explorer 1500 Pro (1,512Wh) (Update: Out of stock): With this Jackery you'll get a dependable machine that performs well. In our usable capacity tests it came in at 90.4% and charges quickly: 0 to 100% in 2 hours, with AC-only charging. Toss in a couple of solar panels and you can drop that time down quite a bit. Jackery Explorer 2000 Pro (2,160Wh): This was a previous title-holder of the fastest charging portable power station. The Jackery units overall are great and dependable. If you're looking for a model (really, an entire lineup) that will recharge fast with multiple, even combined options, Jackery is a no-brainer.  Jackery Explorer 3000 Pro (3,024Wh): Another beast of a unit and a great offering from Jackery. If you're already a Jackery fan but need more battery capacity, this is an easy win for you. Otherwise, recent improvements include wheels, telescoping handling and that round RV plug we've been waiting for.OupesOupes 600W (595Wh): Not a bad little unit. I love that it has the LifePO4 battery. It performed about average (maybe a hair under par) and I feel like it could be cheaper. The name can be hard to pronounce. "Oops" is our best guess. Oupes Mega 3 (3,072Wh): Another great offering from Oupes with stellar performance. The numbers from our test lab slightly favored the Mega 3 over the Mega 5. We also tested the B2 expansion battery with this unit and further improved the numbers for usable capacity. The Mega line continues to impress with both performance and value.Oupes Mega 5 (5,040Wh): Previous titleholder for "best extra-large power station," the Mega 5 is a beast. It maxes out at 5,040Wh, with a single expansion battery option, the B5, bringing the total to 10.08kWh. At 4,000-watt output with a 7,000-watt surge, you'll be able to power pretty much anything you want (as long as it uses either a standard 120-volt plug or the round RV type). It also has a large solar charging capacity (4,050-watt) and in our tests proved to be the second fastest charging unit, going from 0 to 100% in 214 minutes, or 3 hours and 54 minutes. That ends up being 23.55-watt hours per minute charged, which is the second-highest rate we've recorded.  Other portable power stations we've tested
4Patriots Power Sidekick (299Wh): The specs on this small unit are ok - 87% usable capacity is about the norm and it charges at about one watt-hour per minute. That's a bit slow, but not unheard-of for these small units. It does come with a small, 40-watt solar panel, but I think it is still overpriced at $500. 4Patriots Power Generator 2000X (1612.8Wh): While I do think this is a better engineered product than the smaller Sidekick offering from 4Patriots, I still feel like their product lines are overpriced. Again, they do come with small solar panels, but that is hardly worth double the sticker price in many instances. Usable capacity is still in line at 87% but this size unit only charging at 7Wh/min is a bit underpowered in my opinion.Ampace Andes 600 Pro (584Wh): This is an OK unit. It sits right around the industry standard for usable capacity. We did find that the charging moved much slower than the marketing materials claim: 90 minutes to 80% charge vs. the advertised 60 minutes. Apace Andes 1500 (1462Wh): There are a couple of notable improvements between the smaller Pro unit I previously tested and this larger 1500Wh unit. For one - weight. The spec capacity is almost three times larger, and normally capacity and weight are proportional, but despite the larger capacity, the 1500 weighs only a little over double the smaller unit. This thing charges quickly too. It doesn't quite hold up to the company's 55-minute charge time claim, but one hour and sixteen minutes isn't bad!Bailibatt 300W (257Wh): Another small, affordable unit. The Bailibatt comes in at 84% usable capacity, which is good. It takes 11 hours to charge, which is.... not as good. If you have specific limited charging needs and plenty of time to recharge, the price tag makes it worth considering.BigBlue Cellpowa 500 (537.6Wh): This is a better-than-average performing unit at better-than-average pricing, but there's nothing outstanding about it.
The BioLite BaseCharge 1500 offers decent capacity for the price, but it's one of the slowest power stations to charge that we've tested, taking more 6 hours just to charge to 50% and about 13 hours in total to hit 100%. BioLiteDabbsson DBS2300 (2,300Wh): I love that it's a modular format, expandable up to 8.33kWh. The 87% usable capacity is good and charges relatively quickly. It charges at over 18 watt-hours per minute, for a total of 122 minutes to charge the entire 2,300Wh.Dakota Lithium PS 2400 (2,060.8Wh) Update: Out of stock:
The Dakota Lithium PS2400 is the fastest-charging portable power station on our list. Now, looking at our test data, that doesn't mean that it took less time to charge than any other unit, but, in using our residential AC charging method, it instead indicates the unit that charges the most watt-hours per minute. This method allows the large-capacity units to compete in this category with much smaller units that naturally charge much faster. It showed a respectable 90.72% in usable capacity while also giving us our fastest charge metric to date. We showed a charge rate of 26.76 watt-hours per minute, just edging out the Oupes Mega 3 by about 0.3 Wh/m.  Also notable is the unit's 10ms switchover time. Charging from 0% to 100% in 77 minutes, the PS2400 sees 26.76 watts-per-minute charging from a standard 120-volt, 20-amp residential outlet. A close second was the Oupes Mega 3 at 26.48 watts per minute, followed by the VTOMAN Flashspeed in a more distant third at 24.9 watts per minute. Different units make up the bulk of the next-best contenders, from companies like Oupes, VTOMAN, UGreen and Goal Zero. If charging to recover your total capacity is a major concern for you, these are the units to look at. In addition, they all offer simultaneous charging from other inputs like solar or other DC inputs if you need to up your recharge game.DaranEner NEO2000 (2,073.6Wh): This unit didn't win any categories, but it did perform in the top tier for our charge tests and came in about average for our usable battery capacity tests. This sturdy unit has plenty of features and one of the lowest prices per watt-hour.Deeno GT S1500 (1,036Wh): We previously tested the Deeno GT X1500, and the S1500 is a big step up. It has the same capacity and same pricing, but with nearly 20% more usable capacity than the previous model and it charges nearly five times faster.Deeno X1500 (1,036Wh): The X1500 did not fare well in our tests. It came through with one of the lowest usable capacity scores we've collected so far at 69.88%, meaning you see about 724Wh out of the stated 1,036Wh. For the price, there are better options.  DJI Power 1000 (1,024Wh): I want to note first off that I do not have a drone that's compatible with the SDC super-fast charge function for select DJI drones. I think that's likely to be one of the best selling points for this particular unit. I'm also happy that there are two 140-watt USB C ports. Outside of those features, there isn't much else to talk about. It does charge fast but it came in low on our usable capacity test. Duracell Power 500 (515Wh): This is the first Duracell unit I've tested, but not the first battery brand to put out a portable power station (see Energizer at the top of this list). So far, the results are similar. Test results come back with under-average performance and questionable prices.
Give Duracell some credit for its likable -- and familiar -- power station designs. Ry Crist/CNETDuracell M250 (219Wh): Overall, this smaller unit is proportionally comparable to the larger Power 500 Duracell model. The M250 came in at 75% usable capacity, just a couple of points higher than the Power 500. You're getting approximately half the capacity for half the price. Charging is also in line, taking around the same time (4+ hours) to charge half the capacity (at half the input power). I like the cylindrical shape -- I'm guessing Duracell wants it to look like that familiar battery profile -- and that the lid opens up to allow for power cable storage within the unit.EBL MP1000 (999Wh): This is not a bad little unit. Doesn't charge too quickly, but overall usable battery capacity is good. It has a wireless charge pad and lots of options for inputs and outputs. It isn't something I'd run out to buy for myself, but if you can catch it on sale, it could be a low-cost way into a smaller power station. Encalife UAF550 (595Wh): Of the three Encalife chargers, this has the largest usable capacity percentage at 87% but the slowest charging at 1.98-watt hours per minute. Encalife UAF1100 (992Wh): Industry standard usable capacity here at about 84%, but a bigger drop in the charge capabilities at 3.35-watt hours per minute from its larger sibling.Encalife YUE2000 (2,048Wh): A bit of variation in our model hierarchy groupings with Encalife. As you might expect, charging capabilities do increase with larger units. The YUE2000 being the largest of the three charges relatively quickly, at about 11.13 watt-hours per minute. In this series, the usable capacities trend in the other direction, with this unit showing 73% usable capacity.Enernova ETA 288 (288Wh): This is another example of a hierarchy of models where the smaller units underperform, but larger models improve. This unit took about 3 hours and 40 minutes to charge, but it reached about 81% usable capacity. Enernova ETA Pro (1,050Wh): Moving up a notch, this one has 83% usable capacity and charges 1kW in about 1 hour and 30 minutes. It's a better showing and about 10 cents cheaper per watt-hour than its smaller sibling. Enernova ETA Ultra (2,150Wh): This is the best of the three, sporting 2160Wh, 87% usable capacity and it charges in under 2 hours. Energizer PPS700 (626Wh) (Update: Currently Unavailable): OK performance and features overall, but one of the lowest-tested capacities, making the usable capacity closer to 477Wh. Etaker M2000 (2008Wh): While the M2000 didn't win any of our categories, I do like the platform. More manufacturers are offering increased capabilities like ones you'll see here: semi-solid state battery engineering, modular platform to increase capacity, ability to expand to 240VAC, direct EV charging and a few more use cases that are more niche. It's a reasonable grab, especially if you're looking for something more sturdy like cold weather charging -- all with a usable capacity percentage of 91 -- above average for the units we normally test.
Fanttik's EVO 300 power station features a large, easy-to-read display. FanttikFanttik Evo 300 (299Wh): This is a solid pick in the small power station category, and this unit has my favorite display: It's extra large and easy to read. We did see average performances on our charging and capacity tests. Generac GB1000 (1,086Wh): Generac has been a household name in the power landscape (especially generators) for dozens of years in the US. It isn't that surprising to see it here in the portable battery space. I wasn't blown away by this unit. It tested quite average (if not a smidge below on charge speed) but overall, still does what you need: to transport power.Geneverse HomePower One (1,002Wh): This unit was the second slowest overall to charge, but did well on its usable capacity rating at 91%. Its display is small but offers all the standard input and output features you'd want. Geneverse HomePower One Pro (1,210Wh): This is the grownup version of the Geneverse HomePower One. The feature specs are about the same, but at $500 more, you're only getting about 200 extra watt-hours. In addition, the standard One model comes in at 91% usable capacity versus the Pro model's 73%. That gives you 912.6 usable watt-hours with the standard and only 886.7Wh on the Pro. The Pro charged in almost a quarter of the time it took the standard version.  Goal Zero Yeti 200X (187Wh):: The Goal Zero products are solidly made, but we got the lowest score in our "usable capacity" tests from this unit. It's about 65% compared to the industry-accepted norm of 85%. There are better products in the small portable power station category.  Goal Zero Yeti 700 (677Wh): Overall this unit tested OK; nothing outstanding. One of the more interesting aspects of the design is the use of plastic protective 'flaps' covering the in/output ports. The use case here seems to be for a more rugged durability for camping or otherwise roughing it where you might have an increased exposure to mud, dirt, dust or water. Outside of those environments, the flaps can be bothersome.Goal Zero Yeti Pro 4000 (3,993.6Wh): Runner-up for our best extra-large power station title, the Yeti Pro 4000 is a tank (which, by the way, is the name of the expansion battery: "Tank Pro 4000"). You get tons of input and output options, and it is expandable to 20kW capacity. We were able to charge this via standard AC outlet in 2 hours and 49 minutes, giving us our third-fastest charging rate so far at 23.63 Wh/min charged. It also offers 3,000-watt solar input. If you're looking into home backup, also check out the Haven10 transfer switch accessory to bring your home online.GoSun PowerBank 1100 (1,100Wh): I wanted to like this unit more, partially because of GoSun's extended offerings of solar-friendly devices. As far as capacity goes, this runs in the middle of the pack, but man is it slow to charge. It took nearly 12 hours -- over six times as long as our largest power station (Jackery Explorer 2000 Pro) -- which offers nearly twice the capacity. At $1,199, I'd like to see a faster charging option and more outputs or at least wireless charging. Lion Energy Safari (1,612Wh): I tested two units, the first I've had my hands on, from Lion Energy. Two immediate observations on the superficial side: First, I like the physical packaging of these units. It reminds me of Oupes, which I also like. Second, these things sound like the names of energy drinks. Otherwise, I wasn't impressed. This larger unit also had a bad connection to its display screen. In general, the color screen looks better than most other options. In my case, I had several lines plaguing each view. Lion Energy Summit (665Wh): The TL;DR is above, with the larger unit, but for additional context, units tested about average in terms of usable capacity. My main performance complaint is the charge speed. Both units are a bit low for their capacity category. I would be happier if the Summit charged at the Safari rate, and the Safari was retooled for nearly double its current speed.Litheli PowerHUB B600 (562Wh): This one can be slow to charge, but otherwise, there's a lot to like here. It has good usable capacity at a decent price, since it's currently marked at about 40% off. Litheli is also offering a battery platform (U-Battery) with this unit. Two smaller batteries plug into the main unit that you can then use with a variety of other tools. Check out our upcoming coverage on handheld vacuums to see Litheli's performance there.  Litheli PowerHUB Eclair1000 (1,069Wh): Another unit from Litheli offering the U-Battery platform, but it's closer to double the capacity of the last unit we tested. The capacity score was low, but the charge speed has vastly improved from the B600. Worth a look if you're interested in the U-Battery platform.
Though pricey, the Mango Power E is our runner-up pick in the fastest-charging category, and capable of charging its impressive 3,530Wh capacity battery from zero to 100% in less than 3 hours. Mango PowerMango Power E (3,530Wh): I mentioned this unit earlier as the runner-up in the fastest charging category. This thing is loaded with features, even allowing you to provide 240-volt service by linking a second unit. There are also battery expansions for the Mango Power E. The one downside is the price tag, as this unit also comes through as the most expensive portable power station with a list price of $4,250.  Milwaukee M18 Carry-On Power Supply: It isn't a great portable power station. You're probably considering buying it because you're already on the platform. If that's the case, I say go for it. It will work with all batteries on the M18 platform, so you have some control over how much juice you want to carry around. This will put a fair amount of convenience into situations for people who are Milwaukee tool users and find themselves in energy-shy situations. Monster Power Grid 300 (296Wh): The Power Grid 300 can be slow to charge but did test at over 90% usable capacity. It has all the bells and whistles you'd expect at this level at a price that's a tad high.  Oscal PowerMax 700 (666Wh): Another unit that didn't perform particularly well in our tests, but does boast a ton of features, including a "non-stop continuous power supply mode."  Oukitel BP2000 (2,048Wh): This is the first unit we've tested from Oukitel (along with its expansion battery -- we will be publishing more on expansion batteries soon) and we were pleasantly surprised. To begin, the BP2000 scored an impressive 90% on usable battery capacity and also scored well in our charge tests, taking less than 2 hours to charge all 2048Wh of capacity. Oukitel is also leaning into the modular and expandable approach, allowing you to add up to seven additional units for a total of just over 16kWh of power. The BP2000 also boasts sub 10ms switchover time as its UPS feature.Pecron E1500 (1,536Wh): I will say that I'm a bit torn with this unit. I tested the E2000LFP model first and was impressed with the results. The E1500LFP did not fare as well. Specifically, the usable capacity came in especially low at 68% compared to the E2000 at 94%. Other than that, the charging is beefier, charging at about twice the rate as the other unit. And you still get perks like wireless charging and expandability from 1536Wh up to 7680Wh. Pecron E2000LFP (1,920Wh): I discussed this unit briefly earlier as the runner-up to the Delta Mini in the "best portable power station for camping" race. It has more options than the Mini and is suitably priced. I'm also a fan of any of the companies that adopt the modular approach with the capability to expand capacity with external batteries, like Pecron has done. You can also pick up a rolling caddy for the unit if you're on the go.Phyleko ENF1000S (1,024Wh) (Update: Currently Unavailable): I've seen this body style before in the GoSun 1100; it feels super sturdy and I do like the larger colorful display. Otherwise, this unit landed just under average in our tests.  Power Cache 300 (293.76Wh): We tested a trio of power stations from Power Cache. The 300 model did well as far as usable capacity goes (91%) but took over 7 hours to charge. Another upside is that it's affordable, with a $200 retail tag. Power Cache 600 (642.6Wh): Costing $250 more than its smaller sibling, this middle child showed the least impressive performance of all three models, coming in at only 72% usable capacity and taking over 8 hours to charge to 100%. If price is your main concern, it's an affordable option.Power Cache 1000 (1,075Wh): The largest of the three units, this one performed moderately, coming in at 82% usable capacity and taking about the same amount of time to charge as the small 300 model, which is just over 7 hours. That does mean it charges over four times faster than the small unit, but 7 hours is still 7 hours. Selling at $470.
The Renogy Phoenix 200 is an affordable option among small-sized power stations. RenogyRenogy Phoenix 200 (189Wh) (Update: Currently Unavailable): Slower to charge, but it has 96% usable battery capacity paired with the lowest price of any unit we've tested. This a great option for smaller use cases or for people generally interested in checking out portable power stations at a reasonable price.  Renogy 1000 (998.4Wh) (Update: Currently Unavailable): This is another decent performer. It charges fast enough for its relative capacity category, but only offered us about 80% usable capacity. Normally, I wouldn't be too bothered, but the smaller Renogy unit we tested clocked in at 96% usable capacity, so I was hoping for more. Rockpals 300W (Update: Currently Unavailable): This unit also came in under the line in usable capacity. Given the industry standard of 85%, Rockpals' 78% is lacking. In terms of charge speed, this unit is one of the faster small portable power stations. It has decent features and kind of looks like a handheld radio.  Rocksolar Nomad RS650 (444Wh): Until the company updates this unit, there are likely better options for almost anything you're looking to do. It has a high price, low usable capacity, slow charge time and is low on features and options, but it does work.  Runhood Rallye 600 (648Wh): There are a couple of these types of units on the market now, and I've been waiting for their arrival. This Runhood unit is the first modular-style portable power station I've been able to get my hands on, and I love what it means for the industry. Performance-wise, this model was about average, but it could offer you more flexibility and convenience than many other units. The batteries are swappable, so you can pick up extras, in addition to standalone AC and USB modules that can use those extra batteries without being plugged into the main power station unit. This could be a game-changer for trips where every member of the family is off in a different area draining some electronic device. I look forward to adding a "best modular power station" category soon. Runhood Rallye 1200 (648Wh) (Update: Currently Unavailable): The capacity is the same for this unit as it is for its younger sibling, the 600 (listed above). The 600 and 1200 designations refer to the constant power output in watts, with each unit's peak power doubling that constant power number. You do get an extra AC outlet but the increase in power output is the main difference. Likely worth it if you're into the modular design, but need more power than the 600 has to offer. Segway Cube 1000 (1024Wh): I am always excited to check out new entries into the portable power station category, especially from companies that are already in similar spaces. The Segway Cubes are a solid first product, leaning into modularity and avoiding an attempt to match all the latest bells and whistles. The units show an average usable capacity percentage, the same for charge speed. Segway Cube 2000 (2040Wh): The Segway Cubes are offered in retail capacities of either 1 or 2kW. The platform is expandable to 5kW. The interesting choice is Segway's decision to offer both the 1kW and 2kW retail options, when both options are otherwise identical and identically expandable. It seems that either retail option contains an identical inverter and 1kW battery. The Cube 2000 offers an additional battery expansion that goes between the two previously mentioned units. At that point, you can add a total of four battery expansions to max out the platform at 5kW.Togo Power Advance 346 (346Wh): This unit held the title for best small portable power station for about two years on this list; solid performance, great features and an attractive price tag. Ugreen Power Roam 600 (680Wh): This unit didn't do great in our tests, but it has a reasonable price. It charges quickly, but that has more to do with the smaller capacity than an elevated charging capability.  Ugreen PowerRoam 2400 (2,048Wh): I was happy to see that this model did better than the previous smaller model we tested. 83% on usable capacity and it charged in the same amount of time as the smaller unit, about 1.5 hours for each one, which means the 2400 was charging at about four times the rate. This one also has wheels and a telescoping handle for ease of movement.VTOMAN Flashspeed 1000 (828Wh): This is the second VTOMAN Flashspeed I've tested and the smaller of the two. This smaller unit didn't fare as well as its big brother in our tests. While it's a capable machine, I struggle to find a scenario where the minimal cost difference between the two would keep me from buying the 1500 over the 1000. VTOMAN Flashspeed 1500 (1,548Wh): This unit did about average on our usable capacity test, but, charging from 0 to 100% in 64 minutes, the FlashSpeed 1500 sees 24.19 watts-per-minute charging from a standard 120-volt, 20-amp residential outlet, which is one of the fastest charge rates we've seen here in the test labs. If charge speed and time are primary concerns for you, it's almost impossible to do better than the Flashspeed 1500.Yoshino B330 SST (241Wh): This is a cute little power station. It has a USB-C 100-watt port, a couple of AC outlets and is pretty light for what it offers. It comes in just above average for usable capacity but does have a slow charge rate. If you're looking for a little power in a compact package, it's worth considering.Yoshino B4000SST (2,611Wh): This unit tested fairly well in our lab. 87% usable capacity, blazing-fast charge speeds and a decent feature set. It's an option worth considering, if you can find it on sale.
The Zendure SuperBase Pro 2000 is another interesting option, and one of our top-tested large-sized power stations. Steve Conaway/CNETZendure SuperBase Pro 2000 (2,096Wh) (Update: Out of stock): The first unit we tested with the Li-NMC battery composition. This unit also just missed the best large portable power station title. It has a weight-to-capacity ratio, likely thanks to the NMC composition, and boasts our highest solar charging capacity to date at 2,400 watts. Its telescoping handle and wheels make it easier to manage, but the form makes it better for navigating paved walkways than "off-road" terrain.  70mai Hiker 400 (378Wh) (Update: Out of stock): This unit didn't fare too well in our tests, coming in at about 75% usable capacity (versus the industry standard of 85%) and taking about 4 hours and 30 minutes to charge its 378Wh. 70mai Tera 1000 (1043.9Wh): The larger of the two 70mai units tested better, hitting the industry standard for usable capacity and taking about 20 minutes less to charge nearly three times the capacity of the smaller model.  Portable power station FAQs
What battery types are most common in portable power stations?
A significant trend in modern portable power stations (including the Jackery Plus series, Anker Solix models, Bluetti units, EcoFlow River 3, Fossibot F3600 Pro, and Oupes Mega 1), is the adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery chemistry. This has several advantages over older lithium-ion formulations, most notably a significantly longer lifespan, often rated for 3000 to over 6500 charge cycles before significant capacity degradation. LiFePO4 batteries are also recognized for their improved safety profile and better thermal stability, performing more reliably across a wider range of temperatures. Some units, like the Grecell T-1000, may still use older chemistries such as NCM (Nickel Cobalt Manganese), which, while offering good energy density, typically have a shorter overall cycle life.

How many years do portable power stations last?
How many years a portable power station will last depends on three key factors: how well the product is maintained, how often it's used and the battery type.We have researched and spoken with several manufacturers and most units boast a 500-cycle lifespan. In some cases, such as the Anker 757, a unit may use LifePO4 batteries compared to the more common Li-ion battery, offering up to 3,000 cycles or beyond.One cycle means using the product from fully charged to zero charge (or at least 80% in some cases). If you use your portable power station several times a week, it might only last a year or two. If you use it less frequently, it could last for much longer.

What can you run on a portable power station?
Portable power stations are generally designed to power smaller electronic devices and appliances, from phones and table fans to heavy-duty work lights and CPAP machines. Pay attention to the estimated watt-hours each brand provides in its specs to determine which model makes the most sense for what you'd like to power.If a company says its portable power station has 200 watt-hours, it should be able to power a device with a 1-watt output for about 200 hours. I go into more detail on this in the "How we test" section of this article, but consider the wattage of the device or devices you want to power and then the number of watt-hours your portable power station would need to have.

Jackery vs. Anker: Which portable power station brand should you choose?
You won't go wrong with either. Both Jackery and Anker have been in the industry for a long time and offer portable power stations that hit a variety of sizes and price points. You can see some of our most prominent recommendations on our list, including the Jackery Explorer 2000 Plus as our best overall and the Anker Solix F3800 Plus for the best whole-home backup. With both brands you get a generous five-year warranty and fairly frequent sales.

Can a power station run a refrigerator?
Possibly, depending on the fridge and the portable power station. For example, this standard LG refrigerator has an estimated annual energy consumption of 608 kilowatt-hours. That works out to 1.67 kilowatt-hours per day or 1,670 watt-hours per day. 1,670 watt-hours per day works out to just under 70 watt-hours per hour. If you have a short-term power outage and only need to power your fridge, a 200-watt-per-hour power station could keep it running for nearly three hours. You'd need a power station with higher estimated watt-hours to run your fridge for longer. A mini fridge would last much longer than a larger model. Always confirm the electrical requirements for your specific fridge and portable power station before trying this, especially your refrigerator's peak and startup watts.

How long can you run a portable power station?
You can get close to the answer with some basic math. If you have a power station that is rated at 1,000 watts per hour, and you plug in a device, let's say a TV, rated at 100 watts, then you can divide that 1,000 by 100 and say that it will run for 10 hours. This isn't usually the case. The industry "standard" is to say that you should take 85% of the total capacity for that math. In that case, 850 watts per hour divided by 100 watts for the TV would be 8.5 hours. The reality is that you should expect somewhere between 8.5 and 10 hours, in this example.

How is a portable power station different from a generator?
A portable power station is essentially a big rechargeable battery that you carry around. Deplete it, and it's useless until you can recharge. A generator, by definition, is a device that actually converts some type of energy to usable electricity in whatever circuitry you have it connected to. Examples of these would be gas generators (commonly used as power sources for remote areas or as whole-home backups), electric generators (not very common, but they convert some type of mechanical action to electricity) and solar generators, which can use solar panels to power devices or homes -- often using a battery to temporarily store the electricity. These batteries are often portable power stations themselves.

Can you use solar panels with a portable power station?
Yes, many portable power stations can work with solar panels to offer charging options off the grid. These include the Jackery Solar Generator 2000 and most options in Jackery's lineup, various offerings from EcoFlow including the River 3 series, Bluetti, Oupes and even lesser-known brands like Grecell. Take a look at our list of the best solar generators for a more comprehensive look at CNET's testing and recommendations.

Can you use a portable power station as a UPS?
Yes, a portable power station can be used as an uninterruptible power supply. Many portable power stations come with UPS features, like automatic switchover when power loss is detected. You'll find this on the EcoFlow River 3 series, which comes with a 20-millisecond takeover for the River 3 and a 10-millisecond switchover for the River 3 Plus and River 3 Max, not to mention even larger power stations like the Anker Solix F3800 and Fossibot F3600 Pro that are capable of home backup.

What is the difference between a power bank and a portable power station?
A power bank is vastly different from a power station. There's a significant difference in the amount of energy they can store, the cost of owning them and the devices they can charge. A power bank is a small, portable device that's used to charge electronic products like smartphones, laptops and more. On the other hand, a power station can store huge amounts of energy to power electrical appliances like mini-fridges, microwaves and more.
Show more
Can a portable power station be your home backup?
The answer, surprisingly, is yes. The extra-large power stations on our list like the Anker Solix F3800 and Fossibot F3600 Pro are both capable of powering large appliances like refrigerators, TVs and even washers and dryers. They also support battery expansion and can connect to solar panels for recharging. This gives you plenty of juice and the new Anker Solix F3800 Plus can even be paired with a smart electric panel so that it can automatically back up circuits in your home, similar to the EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra.
