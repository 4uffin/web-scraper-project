Fiber internet FAQs
What is the best fiber internet provider?Among all the internet connection types we've reviewed, fiber internet is at the top of our list. When it comes to ranking providers, CNET's pick for the best fiber internet service provider in the country is AT&T Fiber thanks to its consistency, high customer satisfaction ratings and fast symmetrical speeds. AT&T Fiber is a crowd-pleaser and consistently gets top marks in customer satisfaction surveys, likely due to its variety of plans, competitive pricing and customer-friendly service terms. There's a lot to like -- but only if you can get it at your address.In terms of availability, high speeds and straightforward pricing, I wouldn't pass on Frontier Fiber, Quantum Fiber, Kinetic by Windstream or Verizon Fios, either. But if these providers aren't available at your address, regional providers deserve some love, too. Providers like Brightspeed, Metronet or Ziply Fiber -- the fastest ISP nationwide -- may offer fast internet service in your area.It's important to note that fiber internet isn't the most broadly available internet connection type. According to the latest Federal Communications Commission data, only 48% of the US population has access to a fiber connection. Still, CNET considers fiber the gold standard of home internet connections and a sure way to future-proof your home. Let's take a closer look at what the top fiber ISPs in the country have to offer.

AT&T Fiber
Best fiber internet provider overall Our take - AT&T has the greatest availability of any fiber provider, extending service to more than 16 million potential customers across 22 states. Compared to other big-name providers, AT&T is among the cheapest when considering cost per Mbps and there are no hidden fees. However, if all you can get is AT&T's fixed wireless plans, you're better off looking into Frontier Fiber and Verizon Fios.

Cons

All plans -- from the budget-friendly 300Mbps plan to multi-gig service -- come with free equipment rental, unlimited data and no contracts.
Fast speeds, relatively low pricing and customer-friendly service terms have earned AT&T high customer satisfaction ratings in recent years. While AT&T's customer service rating dropped in the most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index from 80 to 78, it still scored first place.

Best cheap fiber internet plan Our take - Frontier Communications recently expanded its fiber internet coverage to 19 states and then rolled out a new multi-gig service to the entire footprint simultaneously, becoming the first major ISP to do so on such a wide scale.

Term agreement required to get signup bonuses
Frontier's multi-gig plans are priced competitively at $70 monthly for speeds up to 2,000Mbps and $90 monthly for the 5-gig plan. Its 7-gig plan is priced at $200 monthly, and is a little steeper than what you'd see from Google Fiber (which offers an 8-gig plan for $150 monthly). However, Frontier also offers a 500Mbps plan for $30 per month -- that plan is one of our favorite internet deals right now. Even after the 500Mbps plan jumps to $55 after a year, the plan is still a good deal. Few providers -- fiber or otherwise -- offer that much speed for the price.
With unlimited data, no contracts and top-notch equipment included in your service, it's all fairly straightforward. So, other than taxes, Frontier plan pricing is very much "what you see is what you pay." Just be sure to sign up for autopay to get the lowest rate.
Note
: Verizon is acquiring Frontier Fiber in a $20 billion deal, which was just approved by the FCC. While we're not sure exactly what that entails, Verizon has stated that Frontier's plans will undergo "immediate integration."

Verizon Fios
Best perks with fiber internet Our take - Verizon Fios is up there with AT&T Fiber and Frontier Fiber in terms of speed, pricing and service terms. The cheapest tier, which starts at just $50 a month, comes with download and upload speeds of up to 300Mbps. The next speed level -- 500Mbps for $75 monthly -- also carries decent value, but the gigabit service at $90 is priced the same or a touch higher than you'll find with other fiber providers.

Pros and Cons
Pros All Verizon Fios plans are 100% fiber, with symmetrical download and upload speeds
No data caps or allowances on any plans
No term agreements necessary on any plans
Cons Low fiber availability for a national company
While Fios and 5G are affordable, LTE and DSL options are pricey
If you're one of the lucky ones, you'll likely realize that Verizon's fiber internet service is hard to beat, especially for those looking for a low-cost connection. Whichever Fios plan you sign up for, expect some enticing extras with your purchase, such as a three- to five-year price guarantee (a rare gem in the world of broadband), a discount of up to $400 for select Samsung products, free streaming subscriptions or other promotional offers like a JBL PartyBox speaker.
Verizon Fios falls short in terms of coverage. It's available to nearly the same number of potential customers as AT&T Fiber, but unless you're in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast region, you may be better served by a different provider.

Best price guarantee among fiber providers Our take - If you thought Verizon Fios's price lock guarantee was great, Quantum Fiber offers a price-for-life guarantee for all plans. You can choose from two main plans: 500Mbps for $50 monthly or 940Mbps for $70 monthly. Select locations may have the choice of faster speeds, including the 3,000Mbps and 8,000Mbps tiers.

Cons Availability limited to select areas Few plan options
The price guarantee locks in the monthly internet rate for as long as you keep your service. That doesn't mean your total bill won't ever go up, as taxes and fees can inflate the cost, but you won't have to worry about significant and continuous rate increases.
Note
: AT&T just announced a nearly $6 billion deal to purchase 95% of Quantum Fiber's network. That means Quantum Fiber's low rates -- and "Price for Life" guarantee -- may be switched out for AT&T's promotions instead.

Google Fiber
Best fiber provider for gig and multi-gig internet Our take - If you're eyeing gig or multi-gig speeds, Google Fiber is the provider for you. Plans start at gig speed and only go up from there. With these starting speeds, the starting monthly rate of $70 is understandably higher than many internet providers.

Cons No cheap plan options Fiber network still has room to grow
Faster speeds will run $100 or more each month, but considering the speeds you get, 2-gig, 5-gig or 8-gig, the cost is well worth it. More importantly, you don't have to worry about confusing service terms; all plans come with free equipment, no contracts and no data caps, making Google Fiber one of the most straightforward and customer-friendly internet providers out there.
At present, coverage is still growing, with Google Fiber's service limited to only 19 states and parts of Washington, DC.

Kinetic by Windstream
Best rural fiber internet provider Our take - Select neighborhoods in larger cities often have fiber internet. But if you're living in the suburbs or a rural area, your best chance to get fiber internet is from Kinetic by Windstream. Roughly a third of Windstream's network -- which spans rural and suburban areas across 18 states in over 350 communities -- is fiber optic.

Cons Speeds and pricing vary widely by location

Below average customer satisfaction
Windstream is one of our top picks for the best rural internet providers, bringing high-speed connections to places likely underserved by cable or by other fiber internet providers. Those in a Kinetic service area will also appreciate the low pricing -- $25 per month for speeds up to 100Mbps. If you need a little more speed, Kinetic also offers a 300Mbps plan for $40 per month and is currently offering its 1-gig plan at $40 a month for the first three months and $70 after. The top-end 2-gig speed tier is priced at $100 per month. Like most top fiber internet providers, Kinetic internet comes with unlimited data and no contract requirements.

Pros and Cons
Pros Straightforward, competitive pricing

Dedication to fiber expansion, even in rural areas
Cons Lots of room to grow fiber network "B" rating by the Better Business Bureau
As streaming, online gaming, work from home and remote schooling have become more commonplace, faster internet speeds are in high demand. Still, 50Gbps is more than the average household will need. For everyone else, Ziply Fiber offers a range of other competitively priced speed tiers from 100 to 10,000Mbps.
Note
: In November 2024, Ziply Fiber was acquired by a Canadian internet company, Bell Canada Enterprises, in a $3.6 billion deal. The deal has yet to be finalized, but a spokesperson from Ziply Fiber told CNET in 2024 that the brand will continue to operate "as the best fiber provider in the Northwest."

The max speed is the top advertised speed for that given plan, but it might not be available in your area. Overall, the best selection for you -- and the most cost-effective plan -- might be a different tier that provides a faster speed at a higher price but a better value.

Fiber service starts at just $30 per month for speeds up to 300Mbps and maxes out at 2,000Mbps for $109 per month. Your equipment is also free with the fiber plans.Metronet: As one of the largest independently owned fiber internet companies, Metronet has a smaller footprint than other fiber providers. But it still offers fast speeds for decent prices. Based in Evansville, Indiana, Metronet is available primarily to cities in the Midwest. Service starts at $30 monthly for 150Mbps. Select areas can see speeds as fast as 2,000 or 5,000Mbps for $75 and $110 per month, respectively. Last year, T-Mobile announced plans to purchase Metronet; the FCC has yet to approve the sale.Optimum: Optimum is primarily a cable internet provider, but it has a growing fiber network, particularly in the Greater NYC area. Approximately 2.8 million households are available for fiber service there. Optimum offers six plans for houses eligible for fiber, 300-,500-,1-gig, 2-gig, 5-gig, and 8-gig plans, which range in cost from $40 to $280 a month. It's important to note that only select households may have access to the multi-gig plans.What is fiber internet?Fiber-optic internet sends data as light signals via thin glass wires either straight to the home, known as FTTH, or to an access point just outside the home, commonly referred to as fiber to the node or fiber to the curb. The technology allows for higher bandwidth and faster data transmission than any other connection type and has the unique capability of delivering symmetrical or near-symmetrical download and upload speeds.

Why choose fiber internet?Your internet speeds, reliability and overall experience don't depend solely on your internet provider. The technology your ISP uses to run service to your home makes a big difference in what speeds you get. Here's why fiber internet stands out as the leading connection type:Speed, upload and download. Fiber internet is the fastest internet connection type with speeds up to 1,000Mbps and higher available from nearly every fiber ISP. The technology also has the added benefit of delivering symmetrical (or nearly symmetrical) upload speeds. Upload speeds are more important than you think, so fast speeds are nice to have when gaming online, uploading posts to social media, or taking a video call.Reliability. Many fiber ISPs (AT&T Fiber, Frontier Fiber, Quantum Fiber, Verizon Fios included) claim over 99% reliability. A fiber-to-the-home connection also ensures speed consistency and reliability during peak usage times.Value. Fiber internet providers have some of the highest-priced plans, but the slower, cheaper plans are often comparable to service from cable or 5G providers. Considering cost per Mbps and the added advantages of a fiber-optic connection, fiber plans often present the best overall value.How you can shop for fiber internet like a pro Fiber internet is the best type of service for most homes, but there's more to choosing a provider and plan than the connection type. Here are some tips to keep in mind when shopping for fiber internet service.Availability. Fiber internet is not available in nearly as many homes as cable, DSL, satellite or even 5G internet. Only around 48% of US households are wired for fiber-optic internet. In most cities, availability can vary from one neighborhood to the next and is even harder to come by in suburban and rural areas.Speeds. Fiber internet has the fastest upload and download speed potential of any type of internet. Many of the top providers offer speed tiers up to 2,000Mbps (2Gbps), 5Gbps and higher. While the blazing-fast speeds are tempting, they're likely to be faster than your home needs. Check out our guide to finding the right internet speed for help selecting a fiber plan that best meets your needs. Price. If you're looking for cheap internet, fiber may not be your best option. It's true that fiber internet plans are often the best value, but you may find cheaper options from cable or 5G providers. A few fiber providers offer plans with starting prices as low as $30 per month, but you're more likely to pay at least $50 per month for fiber internet. Cable internet providers including Cox, Mediacom, Xfinity and others have lower-priced plans in many areas. If you are a T-Mobile Magenta Max or Verizon wireless customer, you could get 5G home internet for the discounted price of $25 to $35 per month.Bundles. Should you bundle your internet service? Few fiber providers offer a TV service, meaning you may not be able to bundle internet and TV together with the same provider if you choose a fiber internet service. In the days of streaming and cord-cutting, that may not be a deal-breaker for you, but it's something to keep in mind if you're shopping for both services.How we evaluate fiber internet providersTesting an internet provider the same way CNET tests other products and services is, at best, impractical. Instead, we rely on extensive research of each provider to develop our reviews and recommendations.When comparing fiber internet providers, availability, speeds and overall value are at the center of our evaluations. We also examine added fees, data caps, contract requirements, customer satisfaction reports and other factors that could affect your quality of service or customer experience.We refer to the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov for availability data and the type of network a provider uses. We then research a provider's speeds, pricing and service terms through various channels, such as the provider's website and our historical data. When possible, we contact the provider directly to confirm pricing and speed details. Finally, to develop a more well-rounded perspective of the provider, we consider customer satisfaction reports from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, as well as customer reviews and complaints from sources such as the Better Business Bureau, Downdetector.com and even Reddit. (Downdetector is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)Before writing our reviews and compiling best lists, we research anything and everything the typical shopper would want to know prior to signing up for home internet service. Read our piece on how we review internet providers to learn more about our review process. Best fiber internet providers recap
If fiber internet service is available in your area, it's probably worth getting, especially if any of the providers listed above is an option. AT&T is easiest to recommend thanks to its high availability, low costs and favorable service terms, but Verizon Fios is a close second with low pricing, high customer satisfaction and lots of perks for signing up. Google Fiber, Frontier Fiber, Kinetic, Quantum Fiber and Ziply Fiber round out the list of ideal options, while providers like Metronet, Optimum and others are worth a look, too, if available in your area.
Fiber internet FAQs

Is fiber internet worth the money?
Fiber internet is not cheap. The faster the speeds, the more costly your monthly bill will likely be. Starting plans with fiber internet typically range from $30 to $50 a month, with gigabit service ranging from $60 to $90 a month. While there are cheaper plans available with cable or 5G internet service in select areas, fiber service is likely to come with better speed and connection quality for the price.
Show more
Is fiber the best internet connection type?
Yes. Fiber-optic internet offers speeds and reliability that other internet connection types simply can't, and you can get it for around the same monthly price as cable internet or DSL service. The one drawback is availability: Fiber-optic service is available to only about 48% of US residents, according to the latest data from the FCC. For comparison, cable internet is available to approximately 82% of the country.

Will 5G replace fiber-optic internet?
Not likely. While the potential of 5G home internet is promising, it doesn't currently offer the speed or reliability that comes with a fiber-optic connection. That said, the wireless delivery method is rapidly expanding in availability and becoming a popular option among home internet users. Cellular internet and 5G are a viable alternative in areas where fiber connections are not yet available.

When will fiber be available near me?
If fiber hasn't reached your address yet, I'm sorry to say you'll just have to be patient, as providers are actively expanding their fiber networks across the US. You're more likely to see fiber come to your neighborhood if you live in a city or densely populated area, but providers like Windstream and Quantum Fiber show that fiber access in suburban and rural areas is also obtainable. Check out if fiber internet is available in your area.
