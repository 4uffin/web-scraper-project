Starlink internet FAQ
Starlink internet reviewSatellite internet is often seen as a last-resort option, though it can be a lifeline for rural communities lacking 5G internet, cable internet or fiber-optic internet service. In a short time since launching service, Starlink has become a household name, drastically improving rural and on-the-go internet access. To date, Starlink is the only satellite internet provider to offer speeds up to 220Mbps with low latency, thanks to the performance of its 7,000 and counting low Earth orbit satellites. Starlink's recent foray into in-flight Wi-Fi -- where average speeds in the air are actually faster than what you'd get from home internet service on the ground -- and direct-to-cell service further solidify Starlink's sweeping impact on internet access.However, home internet service from Starlink usually comes with a hefty price tag: The standard Residential plan starts at $120 monthly, not including monthly equipment costs. Locating local internet providers
In recent months, Starlink has announced some price cuts on various aspects of its service, though there's some fine print to consider. For example, its Residential Lite service is more competitively priced at $80 a month, but that price is still high compared to much faster speeds that you could get from fiber or cable internet providers. Plus, that Residential Lite service is not as widely available as the standard plan and is subject to more network congestion. If you live in New York and qualify based on income or through participation in federal assistance programs, you can sign up for Starlink for $15 a month -- though you'll still have to pay for equipment.
Locating local internet providers
Equipment costs $349, give or take a hundred bucks. In some cases, you may be able to get that equipment for free, though you have to commit to 12 months of service. Starlink is also imposing a one-time $100 to $500 congestion charge in some areas. The monthly rate on mobile/roam service may be lower, but so are the expected speeds.

Source: CNET analysis of provider data.Starlink's plans can be confusing to navigate, but it typically markets its services as either "Residential" or "Business." Within those categories, Starlink offers on-the-go plans and "priority data" upgrades.There are two standard residential options: Residential Lite costs $80 per month for 50 to 100Mbps in download speeds, while the standard Residential plan costs $120 for 150 to 250Mbps. While both plans technically come with unlimited data, Starlink notes that Residential Lite will be de-prioritized compared to Residential service during peak hours.If you live in New York and qualify for federal assistance programs, you can now get Starlink for $15 a month, though you'll still have to contend with the $349 up-front charge for equipment.Starlink also offers "Priority" plans marketed toward businesses, though you don't necessarily need to own a business to sign up for one of these plans. The Local Priority plans are geared toward fixed-site or mobile businesses on land, while the Global Priority plans are geared toward maritime or global businesses. The Local Priority plans start at $65 monthly for 50GB of priority data; that price tag may seem attractive, but Starlink recommends this plan as a "backup connectivity" option for small businesses.The Roam and Global Priority plans are for those on the go, such as campers, RVers, nomads, mobile businesses or maritime explorers. The plans start with 50GB of priority data for $50 monthly, and there's a "Roam Unlimited" option without a data cap for $165 monthly. Starlink's Global Priority plans are best suited for ocean or global land use and start at $250 monthly with 50GB of priority data.Although the Flat High Performance equipment recommended for the plan costs a hefty $1,499, you can choose between the Enterprise ($699) or Standard ($349) equipment instead. Occasionally, Starlink offers refurbished equipment for $199, but that depends on availability and location.I'd like to see a bit more speed for the price or a lower price altogether, but Starlink definitely adds value in areas where other satellite services cannot, especially through its mobile plans and higher data allotments.For context, Hughesnet and Viasat top out at around 100Mbps to 150Mbps in most areas. Starlink leads with faster speeds and is likely faster than other rural internet options, though it's still just short of the FCC's minimum broadband speed recommendation. Starlink additional fees, data caps and installationStarlink continues to grow in popularity among rural internet customers, and it's clear why. Even though this satellite internet provider boasts impressive speeds, it's always a good idea to take a closer look at the terms of service so you know what you're getting into. Here's what you can expect from Starlink. Data capsStarlink's plans offer "unlimited data," but you'll still be subjected to internet throttling during peak congestion hours. The Residential home internet plan includes unlimited data -- and will be prioritized over the Residential Lite plan during peak business hours. However, you'll still be subject to network congestion like you would with any other fixed wireless internet connection. It's also worth noting that you cannot buy "priority" data if you sign up for the Residential or Roam Unlimited plan; you'll have to upgrade to a Priority plan with a higher monthly rate. The Local and Global Priority plans include allotments of "priority" data starting at 50GB and going up to 2TB.The priority data gives users network precedence over Standard users, potentially delivering faster speeds that are less vulnerable to network congestion. Once your priority data pool is exhausted, the service switches over to standard data. When that happens, bandwidth is prioritized the same way as everyone else's on the network at any given time. As a result, you may experience slower speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle. Still, it's far less of a penalty than the substantial and intentional speed throttling Hughesnet and Viasat can enforce once customers surpass their monthly data allotment. Plus, if you're on a Priority plan, you can top up your data by paying $50 for 50GB if you need to. Congestion chargeIn many areas around the country, Starlink now charges a one-time congestion fee of $100 to $500, depending on where you live. Starlink says on its website, "Our intention is to no longer charge this fee to new customers as soon as network capacity improves." You can enter your email to be notified when the charge is removed.Low latency for online gamingAnother advantage of Starlink is its low latency, advertised as 25 to 60 milliseconds, comparable to cable internet and other terrestrial connection types. Most customers should see latency low enough to support online gaming and avoid excessively lagging video calls.Sometimes called "ping," latency measures the time it takes for information to travel to and from your internet provider. Geostationary satellites, like those employed by Hughesnet and Viasat, orbit some 22,000 miles above the Earth, resulting in the highest latency of any modern internet connection.Starlink's low Earth orbit satellites zip around the planet at an altitude of around 350 miles -- 60 times closer to the Earth's surface than traditional satellites, per the company's claims -- so transferring information back and forth takes far less time.High equipment fees but free installationHughesnet and Viasat allow you to skip the upfront fee and lease equipment for an additional $15 or so per month. No such option is available with Starlink; Customers purchase the equipment and after 30 days, it's theirs to keep. The current cost of standard Starlink equipment is $349, currently lower than its previous offer of $599 -- at least for the time being. If you agree to a 12-month commitment to using Starlink, you may be able to waive that equipment fee entirely.In some cases, Starlink may offer refurbished equipment for a much lower price of $199, but that's not a guarantee and likely depends on product availability and location.Starlink does not charge for installation and offers free professional rooftop installation in select areas. Hughesnet and Viasat, on the other hand, require professional installation, which can add $100 or more to your upfront costs. Better still, Starlink equipment is apparently simple to set up, as seen in the video below.

Take your internet on the go with the Starlink MiniThe rollout of the Starlink Mini leveled up Starlink's appeal to rural, traveling customers. The equipment costs $599, with a monthly subscription cost between $50 and $165. The equipment can fit in your backpack and includes a 30-day trial without a contract requirement, so you can stop and start the service anytime. If you upgrade to the Roam Unlimited plan for $165 a month, you can get unlimited data and guaranteed in-motion use up to 100 mph to access the internet on the go from your vehicle.
StarlinkAlthough the typical download speed averages 50Mbps with a 10Mbps upload speed, Elon Musk shared a speed test while using the Starlink Mini that displayed speeds up to 100Mbps, with a 23ms latency. This means you can get internet quality good enough to binge your favorite shows or game with your friends, whether on a boat in the middle of the ocean or hiking the Grand Canyon.Starlink's simple self-installationStarlink offers free professional roof installation in select areas, but the self-install process seems fairly straightforward. Starlink offers several mounting options for rooftops, yards and the exterior of your home. There's even a Starlink app for Android and iOS that uses augmented reality to help customers pick the best location and position for their receivers.In 2021, CNET's John Kim signed up for Starlink at his home in California and began testing it at various locations. At home, he averaged download speeds of around 78Mbps and latency of around 36ms. You can see more of his first impressions in the video included on this page.Starlink coverage: Available almost anywhere in the US
StarlinkAccording to Federal Communication Commission data from June 2024, Starlink is available to 99.7% of US households. That's the highest coverage percentage of any internet provider, including Hughesnet and Viasat.You can use Starlink's availability checker to see where service is available -- and what speeds you can expect.Service isn't limited to just the US. According to the company, the list of countries currently served by the growing network of low-orbit satellites includes the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and others.Starlink's fleet expansion continues at a rapid rateStarlink has been busy. The total fleet now sits at roughly 7,000 functional satellites, but there's still a way to go. Starlink will likely need at least 10,000 satellites in orbit before it can claim to offer full service to most of the globe, and SpaceX has shown signs that it wants as many as 42,000 satellites in its constellation.What does this mean for Starlink internet?Ideally, Starlink's coverage and speeds will improve with every launch. Starlink's website says, "Starlink users typically experience download speeds between 25 and 220Mbps, with a majority of users experiencing speeds over 100Mbps." The internet speed-tracking site Ookla reported that Starlink offered average download speeds of nearly 67Mbps in the US during the first quarter of 2023. (Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as CNET.)That's down significantly from the end of 2021 when Starlink had median download speeds of just over 100Mbps. The drop may be the result of growing subscriptions and increased network congestion. Hopefully, average speeds will jump back up to around 100Mbps or higher soon as groups of new satellites are added to the fleet.How does Starlink compare?Starlink isn't replacing your fiber, cable or even fixed wireless connections like Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile 5G Home Internet just yet, or possibly ever. That doesn't seem to be the intent behind the service. Starlink is best suited to provide a practical solution for broadband in underserved areas or for a mobile demographic, all areas where traditional wired or fixed wireless services are scarce or unavailable.Such areas have previously had two internet options: Hughesnet or Viasat. Starlink has emerged as a third option, so how does it compare to its satellite internet rivals?Hughesnet can be a bit cheaper per month than Starlink, with standard rates of $50 to $95 for maximum download speeds of 50 to 100Mbps. Viasat is also cheaper, with a standard rate of $100 to $150 per month for up to 150Mbps. So Starlink is a slightly more expensive option than both Hughesnet and Starlink despite the faster speed potential, unlimited data and lower latency.Pricing can be a toss-up between all three satellite providers depending on the ISP or plan you choose and the route you go with the equipment. Starlink holds the advantage in basically every other category, including maximum speeds, latency, data allowances and contract requirements.What's the final word on Starlink?Starlink is an exciting and much-needed addition to rural internet's long-limited landscape. Although service is slower and more expensive than many other providers and connection types, the relatively high-speed potential, low latency, unlimited data and no contract requirements boost its value as a rural internet provider.

Starlink internet FAQ
Does bad weather affect Starlink?
Struggles with inclement weather are a definite downside to satellite internet. Per Starlink's FAQ, the receiver can melt snow that lands on it, but it can't do anything about surrounding snow build-up and other obstructions that might block its line of sight to the satellites."We recommend installing Starlink in a location that avoids snow build-up and other obstructions from blocking the field of view," the FAQ reads. "Heavy rain or wind can also affect your satellite internet connection, potentially leading to slower speeds or a rare outage."
Can you see Starlink satellites in the sky?
Concern about the proliferation of privately owned satellites in space and controversy in astronomical circles about the impact of low-orbiting satellites on the night sky is not uncommon. In 2019, shortly after Starlink's first broadband satellite deployment, the International Astronomical Union released a statement warning of unforeseen consequences for stargazing and the protection of nocturnal wildlife."We do not yet understand the impact of thousands of these visible satellites scattered across the night sky and despite their good intentions, these satellite constellations may threaten both," the statement reads. Since then, Starlink has begun testing various designs intended to reduce the brightness and visibility of its satellites.At the start of 2020, the company tested a "DarkSat" satellite with a special nonreflective coating. Later, in June 2020, the company launched a "VisorSat" satellite that features a special sunshade visor. In August, Starlink launched another batch of satellites -- this time, they all were equipped with visors."We want to make sure we do the right thing to make sure little kids can look through their telescope," SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said. "It's cool for them to see a Starlink. But they should be looking at Saturn, at the moon...and not want to be interrupted." "The Starlink teams have worked closely with leading astronomers around the world to better understand the specifics of their observations and engineering changes we can make to reduce satellite brightness," the company website reads.
Where can I learn more about Starlink?
We'll continue to cover Starlink's progress from various angles here on CNET, so stay tuned. You should also read Eric Mack's excellent work covering Starlink. Among other issues, he closely examines the project's goals and challenges and the implications for underserved internet consumers and astronomers concerned with light pollution obstructing views in the night sky. Beyond that, we expect to continue testing Starlink's network as it expands. When we know more about how the satellite service performs as an internet provider, we'll tell you all about it.
