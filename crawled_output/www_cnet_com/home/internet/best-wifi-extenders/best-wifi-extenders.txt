Editor's Note: We think you should be aware that TP-Link routers are under investigation by the US government over security concerns and could be banned in the US this year, according to multiple news reports. The TP-Link Archer RE605X was previously named our best overall choice for Wi-Fi extenders. While our evaluation of the hardware hasn't changed, out of extreme caution for our readers, we decided to pause it as our top recommendation until we learn more.

Wi-Fi range extender FAQs
Even the newest Wi-Fi routers will struggle to connect every corner of a multi-story home. When that happens, you have two choices: Swap out your router for a mesh system or add a Wi-Fi extender to your existing router. For as little as $20, a Wi-Fi extender can boost your internet signal to a specific area without you having to invest in an entirely new setup. Installation is as simple as plugging the extender into an electrical outlet and connecting it to your Wi-Fi router. If that sounds too good to be true, it kind of is. CNET's testing has found that Wi-Fi extenders can be a passable solution if you're looking to improve the connection in a single room, but you'll likely end up disappointed if you're hoping to boost the speeds to an entire floor or wing of your home. For that, you're better off upgrading to a full-fledged mesh system.If you're looking to bring your Wi-Fi outside the house, be sure to check out our explainer on extending Wi-Fi outdoors, which includes recommendations for Wi-Fi extenders and mesh networks. What is the best Wi-Fi extender overall? If you decide to go the Wi-Fi extender route, our vote for the best Wi-Fi extender is the Linksys RE7310. While it's slightly more expensive than other models at $80, it delivered significant speed boosts in every room we tested and offers full support for Wi-Fi 6 speeds.If you're looking for something more affordable, there are plenty of options for under $50, although not all of them have Wi-Fi 6 support. We've spent the past few years regularly testing them to find the best of the bunch. After countless tests, our data identified the range extenders that reigned supreme. Let's get right to them.

Best overall Wi-Fi extender
Linksys RE7310
In the CNET Smart Home, where we have a fiber internet plan with uploads and downloads of up to 150Mbps, the RE7310 returned average Wi-Fi 6 downloads throughout the entire multistory house of 132Mbps. As for the uploads, Linksys finished with an average whole-home speed to my Wi-Fi 6 test device of 124Mbps. The RE7310 finished in a virtual tie with the TP-Link RE605X on Wi-Fi 6 devices, but was slightly less impressive with earlier-gen Wi-Fi 5 devices, particularly with respect to upload speeds. Still, the performance was solid across the board, and strong enough to take video calls in the Smart Home's basement dead zones, something we would have struggled with using just the single router we ran our tests on. It's a bit bulky-looking, but the RE7310 is the best Linksys range extender we've tested yet, and it's an especially great pick if you can catch it on sale.  ... Show more

A close second
TP-Link RE605X
Pros
Excellent upload and download speeds
Cons
More expensive than other budget extenders
TP-Link makes some of the most popular picks in the range extender category, with a fairly wide variety of options to choose from at various price points. If you're buying one in 2025, the TP-Link RE605X should be right at the top of your list (government investigation notwithstanding). At $64, it's far from the most affordable extender on the market (keep reading for the value picks), but with a highly capable AX1800 design, full support for the latest Wi-Fi 6 speeds and features, adjustable antennas and a helpful, easy-to-use control app with strong reviews on both Android and iOS, it's about as well-rounded as range extenders get.The performance is particularly sharp too. In the tests at the CNET Smart Home, an RE605X in the basement was able to extend the router's signal from upstairs just fine, giving our upload and download speeds a significant boost in every room we tested. Throughout the entire 5,800-square-foot-home, among all the extenders we tested, the RE605X delivered the fastest average upload speeds to both Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 devices, the fastest average download speeds to Wi-Fi 6 devices and the second fastest average download speeds to Wi-Fi 5 devices.By default, the extender puts out its own separate network when you first pair it with your router, and that network will use the same password as your original network, and the same SSID with "-EXT" added to the end. That's better than extenders that put out an unsecured network by default -- and if you use the app to delete that "-EXT" bit, it'll automatically sync up with your original network and work invisibly to keep you better connected, which is ideal. All of that makes this extender an easy recommendation.  ... Show more

The best budget Wi-Fi extender
TP-Link RE220
The TP-Link RE220 was the least expensive range extender during our first run of at-home tests, but that didn't stop it from outperforming everything else we tested at every turn. As Wi-Fi extenders go, it's fast, it's reliable, it works with just about every Wi-Fi router out there, and it's easy to use. And, as of writing this, it costs even less than we paid for it initially -- down to $15 on Amazon.Plug it in and press the WPS button to pair it with your home network, and it'll begin broadcasting its own networks on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. Both offered steady Wi-Fi speeds throughout the home, including average download speeds on the 5GHz band of at least 75Mbps in every room access point we tested, along with strong upload speeds. The RE220 never once dropped our connection, and its speeds were consistent across multiple days of tests during both daytime and evening hours.It's a little long in the tooth at this point, and it won't wow you with Wi-Fi 6 speeds, but the strong ease of use and the steady, dependable level of performance it offers mean it's still an absolute steal. It's not as fast as the top models we've tested in the years since, and we haven't had a chance to retest it at the CNET Smart Home just yet -- but it's still a great choice if you want to boost the signal from the Wi-Fi router to a back room that sits beyond the router's reach, but you'd like to pay as little as possible to get the job done.  ...

D-Link DAP-X1870
Another strong model from our tests, the D-Link DAP-X1870, is an excellent performer that creates a single, unified network as soon as you pair it with your router. That keeps things easy, but at a retail price around $85, it feels a bit too expensive here in 2025.If you're simply looking for the best value pick, we'd probably stick with the $15 TP-Link RE220. However, we'll keep an eye out for any other good sales and update this post as we spot them.  ...

Solid Wi-Fi 6 extender performance for the price
TP-Link RE505X
Last year's top pick, the RE505X is just a slightly less powerful version of the RE605X that costs a bit less. We haven't been able to retest it at the CNET Smart Home yet, but we'll update this post when we get the chance. For now, performance-minded consumers will be glad they spent up for the better upload speeds of the RE605X or the Linksys RE7310, and value-minded buyers will likely be better served with the less expensive TP-Link RE220.That leaves the RE505X as a bit of a middle child at this point, but it was an extremely capable and consistent performer in our earlier tests. At $57, it's one of the cheaper Wi-Fi 6 extenders you'll find.

What is a Wi-Fi range extender?
Also called a Wi-Fi signal booster, a range or Wi-Fi extender is a compact, plug-in device that is simple and hassle-free to implement. Wi-Fi extenders use built-in Wi-Fi radios and antennas to pair wirelessly with your router; no Ethernet" target="_self cable required. Just plug one near the edge of your router's wireless range and pair it with the network, and it'll start rebroadcasting the signal farther out for significantly faster internet speeds throughout your home. Should I buy a Wi-Fi extender?
Wi-Fi extenders are great options when you have a single room that you want to give a speed boost, like an office or a room with a smart TV. Wi-Fi extenders are generally less expensive than upgrading to a full-fledged mesh router with its own mesh Wi-Fi systems and range-extending satellite devices. Plus, they are generally a cinch to set up, they'll work no matter what brand of router you're using, and you can typically use the same SSID and password as your original router. That creates a single, seamless connection that will give you the best Wi-Fi range available with your current setup -- all without you needing to think about it too much.However, signal boosters can't extend your Wi-Fi signal to an entire floor or side of the house like a mesh router can. An extender is only as good as the router it's connected to, which means you won't see huge improvements if your router is failing, outdated or in the wrong spot.
We spent weeks testing these range extenders at the CNET Smart Home. Tristan Rinehart/CNET How CNET tests Wi-Fi extenders and signal boosters
We ran tests at the CNET Smart Home, a 5,800-square-foot multistory home in the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky" target="_self, that served as a living lab for our product tests. It's a much better environment for testing wireless devices at range than a personal, somewhat cramped, shotgun-style house -- and with more ground to cover, it offered a much bigger challenge for these extenders.
Enlarge Image
This is the control graph, showing you the average speeds in each room we tested with no range extenders in play at all. On its own, a single, entry-level Wi-Fi 6 router in the laundry room was able to deliver decent speeds on the main floor of the home (the first four rooms in this chart), but speeds plummeted in the basement (the last four rooms), especially the upload speeds. Ry Crist/CNETThe CNET Smart Home has a fiber internet connection with matching upload and download speeds of up to 150Mbps. That's a far cry from the gigabit connections" target="_blank more and more of us have access to (not to mention the new, blazing-fast multi-gig internet plans" target="_blank emerging across the country). However, it's in line with the Federal Communication Commission's broadband definition, which makes it a great place to test how home networking products will work for the average consumer.For our purposes, we started by setting up a router in the Smart Home's laundry room, where the modem is set up. We went with the Netgear R6700AX" target="_blank, a perfectly decent model we've reviewed in the past. It offered reliable performance but limited range when we tested it -- and that's exactly what we wanted for these range extender tests.
We ran all of this year's range extender tests with a Netgear R6700AX router running the network. It's a low-power, budget-price Wi-Fi 6 model that offered consistent performance when we first tested it out, making it an ideal control router for these tests. Ry Crist/CNETSure enough, the router delivered strong speeds on the home's main floor, but as soon as we went down to the basement level, speeds started to fall. That includes single-digit upload speeds in the bourbon room and the mud room. (Yes, the Smart Home has a bourbon room that the previous owners used to age their own barrels. We don't have any barrels of our own, but it smells amazing in there. Kentucky, ya'll!)Running the range testWith our control speeds established, it was time to start adding in the range boosters and seeing which ones improved things the best. Pairing each one with the router required us only to plug it in nearby and press the WPS button on both devices -- after that, we relocated them downstairs to the basement rec room, which was the farthest point from the router that still had a decent signal and speeds. Whenever you're using a Wi-Fi range extender, that's typically the best place to put it: just shy of the edge of your router's range, where it will still receive a strong enough signal to put out a strong signal of its own. The best way to find that spot? Grab your phone or laptop and run some speed tests" target="_blank.In the end, we ran at least 96 speed tests for each extender, two rounds of 24 tests to find its average speeds to a Wi-Fi 5 client device (an iPad Air 2 from 2015) and another two rounds of 24 tests to check its speeds to a Wi-Fi 6 client device (a 2021 Lenovo ThinkPad laptop). In each case, we started the first round of tests with a fresh connection in the laundry room, closest to the router, and then started the second round of tests with a fresh connection in the mud room, farthest from the router. With each test, we logged the client device's download speed, its upload speed and the latency of the connection. Aside from our speed tests, we streamed video on each extender's network and made several video calls while connected through each one. We also spent time playing with each extender's settings. You shouldn't expect much, but most will at least make it easy to change the extension network's name or password. Some include app controls with extra features, too.
It's also worth making sure that your range extender includes at least one Ethernet port (almost all of them do). If you can directly connect your wired device (like a smart TV), then you'll enjoy speeds that are as fast as possible. Wi-Fi extender test results
Ready to see how the range extenders did in terms of upload and download speeds? Let's take a look.
Enlarge Image
These graphs show the average download speeds by room (left) and average upload speeds by room (right) for a Wi-Fi 6 laptop connected to each extender. All five models we tested delivered noticeable improvements to the connection, but some did a better job than others. Ry Crist/CNETOn the left, this first set of graphs shows you the average download speeds by room for each extender we tested. On the right, you're looking at the average upload speeds. All of these speeds are to our Wi-Fi 6 test device, a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop from 2021.So what jumps out? First, all five of these extenders did a decent job of boosting speeds in those last four rooms, down in the basement. With all of them, we had a faster connection throughout the house than we had when we connected through the router alone. The D-Link EaglePro AI struggled a bit with upload speeds in the basement, but still kept things above a minimum of 20Mbps or so.That was with a Wi-Fi 6 device, though. How did the performance look with an older Wi-Fi 5 device from several years ago?
Enlarge Image
Again, this is average download speeds by room on the left, average upload speeds on the right -- this time, to an older Wi-Fi 5 device. Ry Crist/CNETThings get interesting here -- you can see a greater gulf between download and upload performance, as well as some more distinct weak spots and dead zones throughout the house. Each of the five extenders struggled to keep uploads speedy in the upstairs dinette, for instance. With Wi-Fi 6, we barely saw any issues there at all, save for the Netgear Nighthawk X4S.Meanwhile, in the basement, our top picks from TP-Link and Linksys (as well as the high-performing Asus RP-AX56) were each able to keep download speeds above 100Mbps, which is great. Uploads were another story, as all of the extenders struggled. None of them failed to deliver a usable upload connection outright, though the D-Link EaglePro AI came close with single-digit upload speeds in the basement's farthest reaches.The TP-Link RE605X makes it easy to tweak settings via TP-Link's Tether app on an Android or iOS device. Again, the features make for slim pickings, but you can check signal strength or turn on High-Speed Mode, which dedicates the 2.4GHz band" target="_self for traffic from the router to the range extender, leaving the 5GHz free for your regular Wi-Fi network traffic. That mode wasn't as fast as sharing the 5GHz band like normal when we tested it out, because those incoming 2.4GHz speeds are limited, but it still might be a helpful option in some situations.
Another key takeaway from these tests is that Wi-Fi 6 delivers some of its most noticeable speed boosts on the upload side of things. If you're looking to make lots of video calls, upload lots of large files to the web or anything else requiring sturdy upload performance, then upgrading to Wi-Fi 6 hardware should be high on your list of priorities (assuming you haven't already made the jump). Affordable Wi-Fi booster picks
For our first batch of range extender tests a few years back, we tested four bargain-priced models to see which one offered the most bang for the buck. It was the start of the pandemic and people were scrambling to bolster their home networks -- we wanted to be sure we could point them to a good, budget-friendly pick that would do the best job as a signal booster offering an extra room's worth of coverage in a pinch.
In the end, the aforementioned TP-Link RE220 was the runaway winner. Currently available for $15, it remains a solid value pick.
We've separated these models from the other six because the test setup was different in our initial tests, and it wouldn't be fair to directly compare those results. You've already read about the TP-Link RE220, but here are our takeaways from the others we tested:

With two adjustable external antennas, the D-Link DAP-1620 is pretty powerful for a budget-priced range extender, but it wasn't as consistent as our top pick. Ry Crist/CNETD-Link DAP-1620: This was the only range extender that ever managed to hit triple digits during our tests, with an average speed of 104Mbps in the bedroom during evening hours. The setup was just as simple as what we experienced with TP-Link, too. We could stream HD video, browse the web and make video calls on the extender's network without any issue.
Network speeds were inconsistent, though -- and much slower in daytime hours, with a bigger dropoff than we saw with TP-Link. The device also dropped our connection at one point during our speed tests. On top of that, the app was too finicky for our tastes, refusing to let us log in and tweak settings with the supplied device password, which ultimately forced us to reset the device. That's too much hassle for us to recommend outright, but if you can grab it on sale for less than $30, it could be a decent alternative to the TP-Link RE220.

The Netgear EX3700 wasn't powerful enough for the price. Ry Crist/CNETNetgear EX3700: It's a dated-looking device and it wasn't a strong performer in our tests. The 2.4GHz band was able to sustain workable speeds between 30 and 40Mbps throughout most of the home, which was strong enough to stream video with minimal buffering, or to hold a quick video call with a slight delay. But the 5GHz band was surprisingly weak, often dropping into single digits with only a single wall separating the PC or connected device from the range extender.
We also weren't fans of the web interface, as it seemed more interested in getting us to register for the warranty (and opt in to marketing emails) than in actually offering any sort of control over the connection. WPS button-based setup lets you skip all of that, which is helpful, and some outlets now have it listed for less than $30, but even so, this is one you can safely pass by.

Before investing in a Wi-Fi extender, evaluate the Wi-Fi problems you're trying to fix. Are you trying to improve internet access in one room or extend the internet to an entire floor? Wi-Fi extenders aren't as effective as mesh Wi-Fi systems in improving signal throughout the house, but they still offer impressive speed boosts in rooms that need them. Our top pick was the Linksys RE7310w, with the TP-Link RE605X coming in as a close second. If you want to stay within a budget, our top competitively priced pick is the TP-Link RE220. Wi-Fi range extender FAQs
How effective are Wi-Fi range extenders?
Plug-in range extenders like these can help boost your speeds when you're connecting far from the router, but they can only do so much. The actual speed boost will depend on a multitude of different factors, including the layout of your home, the type of router you're using, the type of device you're trying to connect with and your internet plan's speeds. If your home's internet connection offers top speeds of 100Mbps or higher, then a decent, well-placed range extender should be able to boost your download speeds in a dead zone or when you're in range by at least 50Mbps, if not 100Mbps. That's enough to browse the web or stream video online. Upload boosts are typically a little lower, but should still be enough to ensure that you can make a video call or upload a file to the cloud.

Do Wi-Fi extenders slow down your Wi-Fi?
Most range extenders will put out their own separate network -- usually the name of your original network with "_EXT" added to the end or something like that. Having a separate network like that under the same roof as your main network could potentially cause a small amount of interference, but we haven't seen any noticeable slowdowns on my main network during any of these tests. And, in most cases, you can rename the extender's network and password to match your main network, at which point you'll have a single, seamless network that automatically passes your connection back and forth as you move throughout your home.That said, keep an eye out for client devices (phones, laptops and so on) that automatically connect to whichever network offers the best signal at the time. If you've used a device like that on both your main network and the extender's network, then it's possible that your device will jump from one to the other without you realizing it. For instance, if your laptop is on your main network and you move a bit closer to the extender than the router, then your laptop might lose its connection and jump over to the range extender's network for the stronger signal strength, even though the speeds on that extender network might be slower.

What's the difference between a Wi-Fi signal booster and network extender?
There is no functional difference between a Wi-Fi signal booster and a network extender. Manufacturers use different terms to describe the same products, and all of these devices work the same way -- by re-broadcasting your router's signal through a wired connection (your power outlet). A Wi-Fi repeater is slightly different. It connects to your router wirelessly and re-broadcasts the signal in another room.

Is a Wi-Fi extender better than a mesh router?
In most cases, no. If you're living in a larger home or if you need speeds that are reliably faster than 100Mbps at range, then it's probably worth it to go ahead and upgrade to a mesh router with its own range-extending satellite devices. You've got more options than ever these days, and just about all of them would likely outperform a stand-alone router paired with a plug-in range extender like the ones tested here.Wi-Fi extenders are better suited for situations where you've just got a single room or maybe two where you'd like speeds to be slightly higher. They won't work miracles, but in a situation like that, they'll get the job done.

Where should I put my Wi-Fi extender?
The best approach is to plug the extender in somewhere close to the dead zone you're trying to fix, but not within that dead zone. That's because you need the extender to have a decent connection with your router in order to put out a worthwhile signal of its own.To find a good spot, grab your phone or laptop, connect to your home network and run some internet speed tests in various spots that are adjacent to the dead zone in question. Once you've found a spot near the dead zone that still hits usable upload and download speeds (preferably at least 50% of whatever you're able to hit up close to the router), then you're probably in a good location.

How do I set up my Wi-Fi extender?
Setting up a Wi-Fi extender is about as painless as it gets. Most models support Wi-Fi Protected Setup, or WPS, which is a universal protocol that wireless networking devices can use to connect with each other. Just plug the extender in, wait for it to boot up, press the extender's WPS button and then press the WPS button on your router within two minutes. Voila, connected.

What's the best budget Wi-Fi extender under $100?
Most Wi-Fi extenders cost well under $100, and our runner-up pick, the TP-Link RE605X, is priced just below that at some retailers. If you're looking for an ultra-affordable model, the TP-Link RE220 costs under $20 and outperformed almost every other extender in our initial tests. It's a little outdated at this point -- you won't get Wi-Fi 6 support, for example -- but it still gets the job done for a very low investment.
