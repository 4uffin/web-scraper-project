Wi-Fi routers are among those gadgets that tend to get ignored. Many folks tend not to even shop for one directly, with 71% of the country using equipment provided by their internet provider. Routers are crucial to having a reliable internet connection, which is a deal breaker for a ton of households. That's exactly why we set out to find the best router. To find the top Wi-Fi routers, we spent months testing over 30 of the top wireless routers by writing custom scripts, measuring throughput and carrying a laptop to 61 locations around CNET's lab. We've found the wireless routers that will keep working for years, whether you need that Wi-Fi 7 upgrade, want the best gaming router or want to envelop your home with a mesh system. Our Picks

What's the best overall Wi-Fi router of 2025?This wasn't a hard choice. The Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX6000 is the best wireless router overall. Even though it's a couple of years old, this router still kicked butt against all the others. It was the only wireless router to receive a Top 5 score in our throughput tests on both 2.4 and 5GHz bands, meaning it'll deliver the fastest possible speeds over Wi-Fi. It doesn't get you on the ultrawide 6GHz band -- for that, you'll need to upgrade to a Wi-Fi 6E or 7 router -- but for most people, that won't matter. Best routers of 2025

Best Wi-Fi router overall
Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX6000
Pros
World-class performance on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands
Only one router had a lower jitter score on the 5GHz band (perfect if you want to prioritize work or gaming)
Endlessly customizable settings for gaming
Six gigabit Ethernet ports
You can add another Asus router to create a mesh system
Cons
Designed for gamers (and it looks like it)
No 6GHz band, so you won't be able to take advantage of Wi-Fi 7
Signal was easily blocked by walls on the 2.4GHz band
Why I like it: This thing just works. The test results jumped off the screen: It was the only wireless router to score in the Top 5 on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands in our throughput tests, which measure how fast a router can transmit data to a device wirelessly. The 5GHz band was particularly impressive. We established a baseline of 939 megabits per second through a wired connection on 5GHz; when we moved the GT-AX6000 50 feet away, it barely budged, at 927Mbps. For comparison, the Netgear NightHawk RS700 -- a router that costs more than twice as much -- got only 80Mbps from that distance. The GT-AX6000 also clocked a near-zero 0.03 jitter score on the 5GHz band. In other words, your actions register on your screen nearly instantaneously. That's the kind of performance that's worth paying a little extra for. Who it's for: The GT-AX6000 is clearly marketed toward gamers, but it's a great choice for anyone, regardless of gaming habits. It comes with a ton of nice bells and whistles for gamers -- WAN and LAN aggregation, game console prioritization, simple port forwarding -- but that doesn't mean you have to use them. This router checked every box. It has the latest WPA3 network security standard, automatic firmware updates and parental controls that let you filter websites and apps on specific devices. Who shouldn't buy it: If you have only a handful of devices simultaneously connected to the internet, you probably don't need to plunk down $180 for a high-performing router. I also wasn't crazy about this router's design. All the red lights made me feel like I was mainlining Mountain Dew Code Red. There are some clever ways to hide a wireless router without blocking its signal, like stashing it in a crate or wicker basket, but I wouldn't hold it against anyone who thought this was too much aesthetically. The main drawback from a technical standpoint is that it doesn't give you access to the ultrawide 6GHz band. For that, you'll need to shell out for a pricier Wi-Fi 6E or 7 router.   ... Show more

Best budget Wi-Fi router
TP-Link Deco X55 Pro
Pros
Routinely outperforms routers that cost three times as much
Top 10 throughput scores on both bands
You can control the router with Alexa or Google Assistant devices
Ability to add other TP-Link Deco routers to create a mesh system
Cons
Three US departments are currently weighing a ban on TP-Link routers due to ties to Chinese cyberattacks
Jitter and packet loss scores were middle of the pack
Editor's Note: We think you should be aware that TP-Link routers are under investigation by the US government over security concerns and could be banned in the states this year, according to multiple news reports. CNET reported on the potential ban, too, but in the absence of documented evidence to support the allegations, we chose to continue recommending TP-Link as one of our best router choices. In fact, you can read more about why I still use a TP-Link router here.Why I like it: While it's marketed as a mesh system, the Deco X55 Pro works incredibly well as a standalone router, too. If you don't want to spend more than $70, I haven't seen any routers that come close to the speeds from the Deco X55 Pro. It ranked eighth on the 2.4GHz band and an eye-popping second on 5GHz. The only faster router on 5GHz was the $600 Eero Max 7. Though the range on 5GHz was essentially limited to the room the router was in, that's still incredible performance for a $70 router. Who it's for: This router is best for people living in smaller homes or apartments who don't need a lot of customizable features. It's a true "set it and forget it" kind of router. If you're engaging in only low-bandwidth activities, like streaming TV or browsing social media, you probably won't have any issues in a larger home, either. Who shouldn't buy it: People with multistory homes might have some issues in rooms far from the router. Also, online gamers should look elsewhere: The Deco X55 Pro had below-average packet loss scores on both bands, which could result in some frozen or glitchy screens.   ... Show more

Best Wi-Fi router for larger homes
Asus RT-AX86U Pro
Pros
Impressive range for a single router
Excellent throughput performance, even at longer distances
Incredibly low jitter scores on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands
You can add another Asus router to create a mesh system
Four 1Gbps LAN ports with a dedicated "gaming port"
Cons
No 6GHz band, so it doesn't take full advantage of Wi-Fi 7 devices
Packet loss was relatively high, especially on the 5GHz band
Why I like it: It all comes down to range. The Asus RT-AX86U Pro outperformed nearly every other wireless router we tested. Speeds barely dropped off when we moved further away from the router -- 906Mbps on the 5GHz band from 50 feet away, compared to a baseline of 939Mbps with a wired connection. It also comes with every network security feature we looked for: WPA3 certification, automatic firmware updates and adjustable parental controls.Who it's for: Anyone living in a larger home with multiple floors. Short of a full-fledged mesh system that uses multiple routers, this device performed as well as any I've seen when it comes to signals traveling through walls and across vast spaces. If your home is more than 2,500 square feet, you might still need a mesh system or Wi-Fi extender to completely eliminate dead zones, but the Asus RT-AX86U Pro has such strong throughput performance to begin with, you might not even notice the drop-off across rooms. Who shouldn't buy it: Even though it's marketed toward gamers, I'd steer them to our picks for best router overall or best gaming router. That's because the RT-AX86U Pro had higher packet loss scores than I would've liked, falling in the bottom third of Wi-Fi routers we tested. It was still in the range that's considered acceptable for most users, but gamers might notice a frozen screen or moments of high lag on the 5GHz band.  ... Show more

Best Wi-Fi router for gaming
Linksys Velop Pro 6E
Pros
Lowest all-around jitter and packet loss scores
Access to the ultrawide 6GHz band
-Great price for a tri-band router
Minimalist design that blends with surroundings
Solid range for a single router
Three-year warranty
Cons
Throughput scores were mediocre overall
Why I like it: It's almost unheard of to see a tri-band router for $150. You usually have to pay a premium to get access to the ultrawide 6GHz band, and though it's not as wide as the 6GHz band on Wi-Fi 7 routers, the Velop Pro 6E still returned speeds of 628Mbps through it. I also loved how low-profile this router looks. With a clean, all-white design, this is one router I wouldn't be tempted to hide behind the couch. Who it's for: Gamers, pure and simple. The Velop Pro 6E was absolutely elite where it counts for online gaming: jitter and packet loss. It had a jitter score of 0.19ms on the 2.4GHz band, 0.02ms on the 5GHz and 0.05ms on 6GHz -- all well below the 30ms that’s considered good for online gaming. Its packet loss scores were also exceptional, clocking in at 0.06% on 2.4GHz, 3.06% on 5GHz and 0.05% on 6GHz. No matter which band you're gaming on, you'll get a seamless experience. Who shouldn't buy it: If you won't be doing any gaming, there are better routers out there. The Velop Pro 6E was actually fairly pedestrian when it came to throughput, ranking in the bottom third of wireless routers on all three bands. That's still plenty of speed for gaming -- especially if you're relatively close to the router -- but there are better routers available if you don't need to prioritize ultralow jitter.  ...

Best Wi-Fi 7 router
Eero Max 7
Pros
Incredibly fast tri-band router
Can be used with other Eero routers to create a mesh network
Inconspicuous design
Ultrawide 320MHz channels support the fastest speeds possible
Supports Alexa, Thread, Matter and Zigbee protocols
Cons
Expensive for a single router
Limited range on the 5GHz band
Jitter and packet loss scores were middle of the pack
Why I like it: In one word: speed. The Eero Max 7 averaged 1,513Mbps on the 5GHz band -- good for first place and more than 400Mbps ahead of the next wireless router. On the more exclusive 6GHz band, it returned an average throughput score of 760Mbps, which was third fastest of the tri-band routers we tested. Who it's for: If you just bought a new phone or laptop and want to take full advantage of its Wi-Fi 7 speeds, the Eero Max 7 is a splurge pick that guarantees you the most out of your devices. I'd also recommend it for people paying for a multigig internet plan, or anyone using many smart home devices. That said, the Max 7's range was fairly average, so you may need to add more Eero routers to create a mesh system in larger homes. Who shouldn't buy it: Most people don't need to spend $600 on a Wi-Fi router. This is a router for networking diehards who want the best performance from the latest technology.  ... Show more

Best budget Wi-Fi 7 router
Netgear NightHawk RS100
Pros
Ranked in the Top 10 in throughput tests on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands
As cheap as it gets for a Wi-Fi 7 router
Cons
No 6GHz band
Only one 2.5Gbps port
High jitter on the 5GHz band
Why I like it: It might be misleading to call this a Wi-Fi 7 router. Without access to the 6GHz band, it's sort of like ordering spaghetti and meatballs and getting a plate of saucy noodles. But in this case, those noodles are really good. The RS100 was the ninth-fastest router we tested on the 2.4GHz band and the fifth fastest on 5GHz. When I asked a Netgear representative what makes this router Wi-Fi 7 if it's missing 6GHz, they told me it supports 4K QAM, which is a key Wi-Fi 7 feature that reduces interference and improves throughput. That showed up in our results, with the RS100 clearly benefitting from faster speeds on 2.4 and 5GHz, even if it is missing 6GHz. Who it's for: This is an entry-level Wi-Fi 7 router that's ideal for someone who has a new phone or laptop that supports Wi-Fi 7 but who doesn't necessarily want to pony up $500 for a router. Even if it weren't labeled as Wi-Fi 7, its throughput scores still stand out for a router at this price. Who shouldn't buy it: If you're paying for an internet plan over 1,000Mbps, it's probably worth upgrading to a more advanced router. The RS100 has only one 2.5Gbps port, so you can expect real-world Wi-Fi speeds to top out at around 1,250Mbps.  ... Show more

Recent updates to our Wi-Fi routers page
In March 2025, CNET entirely overhauled our testing process for Wi-Fi routers. Where our previous tests consisted of one person taking speed tests from five different rooms in our lab, we now use custom-made scripts to conduct our testing and data analysis. Instead of speed tests, we removed the internet provider from the equation and now run data throughput tests to isolate the router's performance independent of fluctuations in the internet connection. Additionally, we measure each router's signal strength at 61 marked locations around the lab. You can learn more about how we test routers below. At the same time that we revamped our testing process for wireless routers, we introduced several of the latest models from the major manufacturers and compared them alongside tried-and-true routers we'd previously recommended. That included six Wi-Fi 7 models and 11 total routers that use the newly opened 6GHz band. I hesitated to recommend Wi-Fi 7 routers when they were first released, but that's changed in the past year. Prices on these routers have come down considerably, and Wi-Fi 7 devices are increasingly becoming the standard. If you bought a new iPhone 16 or Microsoft Surface Laptop 7, it has Wi-Fi 7 built in. (You can also search the Wi-Fi Alliance's database to see which devices are certified Wi-Fi 7.) Even if you don't have any Wi-Fi 7 devices, you may want to pay a little extra for a router to make sure it's future-proof. We've also stopped recommending a few older models that've been staples on our best wireless routers list for a while, including Wi-Fi 5 routers like the Netgear Orbi RBK13. Though routers like these may still perform well in the lab, manufacturers will likely stop issuing firmware updates sooner rather than later. If a router will have up-to-date security only for the next year or two, we couldn’t recommend it in good faith.  ... Show more
Factors to consider when buying a Wi-Fi router
There's a lot of jargon to decode when shopping for a wireless router. For most people (myself included), the flashy specs don't really matter. I just want my internet to work smoothly, all the time. Here are the things worth paying attention to. Wi-Fi standards explainedThese days, you'll mostly see three Wi-Fi standards when shopping for a Wi-Fi router: Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7. (Some Wi-Fi 5 routers are still on the market, but you can safely pass them by at this point.) These numbers refer to the generation of standards; Wi-Fi 7 is the seventh iteration of Wi-Fi standards. All these standards were developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a worldwide association of technical professionals. When a device uses the latest standard, an organization called the Wi-Fi Alliance gives its stamp of approval to devices that meet its qualifications.
Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax)Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) Frequency bands 5GHz2.4 and 5GHz2.4, 5 and 6GHz2.4, 5 and 6GHzMaximum bandwidth 80MHz160MHz160MHz320MHzMaximum speed 1.3Gbps9.6Gbps9.6Gbps46Gbps
Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be): Uses the 2.4, 5 and 6GHz bands and doubles the channel size of the 6GHz band from 160 to 320MHz. A typical Wi-Fi 7 laptop could reach "potential maximum" speeds of 5.8Gbps -- 2.4 times faster than the 2.4Gbps possible with Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, according to Intel. Multi-Link Operation (MLO) also allows Wi-Fi 7 devices to simultaneously connect on two bands, providing improved reliability and ultralow latency.Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax): The first Wi-Fi standard to add in the 6GHz band along with 2.4 and 5GHz. Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax): A massive upgrade over Wi-Fi 5, Wi-Fi 6 was the first standard to allow your router to divide the channel it's using -- 2.4 or 5GHz --  to send its signals through smaller frequency allocations. This allowed for much faster speeds than the previous generation.Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac): Wi-Fi 5 used the 5GHz band exclusively. It was the first Wi-Fi standard to exceed 1Gbps maximum speeds, but its range is significantly smaller than Wi-Fi 6. If you think that all sounds confusing, you're not alone. The jump from Wi-Fi 6E to Wi-Fi 7 has been particularly technical. Even though both use the newly opened 6GHz band, only Wi-Fi 7 routers will get the MLO feature. "Whenever I spoke with the Wi-Fi Alliance, they always tried to make people forget that Wi-Fi 6E even existed," said Nicholas De Leon , a reporter covering routers for Consumer Reports (no relation to CNET's Samantha De Leon). "It was kind of a stopgap, Band-Aid solution while on the road to Wi-Fi 7."As if that wasn't confusing enough, some Wi-Fi 7 routers don't even use the 6GHz band. Our pick for the best budget Wi-Fi 7 router, the Netgear NightHawk RS100, is one of them. It's one of the growing wave of "dual-band" Wi-Fi 7 routers, which is a bit of a stretch since they're missing the most important part of the equation. But Wi-Fi 7 is about more than the 6GHz band, said David Coleman, director of wireless networking at Extreme Networks."Wi-Fi 7 introduces several key upgrades that set it apart from tri-band Wi-Fi 6E routers," Coleman said in an email. "For example, Wi-Fi 7 supports 320MHz-wide channels  -- double the size of the widest channels in Wi-Fi 6E -- meaning it can deliver much higher data rates. It also brings 4K-QAM modulation, boosting transmission efficiency by up to 20% compared to Wi-Fi 6E."Keep in mind that you'll need both a Wi-Fi 7 router and a Wi-Fi 7 device to take advantage of the standard's improvements. When Wi-Fi 7 was officially launched, in January 2024, very few devices could actually use it. Today, that list has expanded tremendously and includes the latest iPhones, Microsoft Surface laptops and the PS5 Pro. These Wi-Fi standards are backward compatible, so a Wi-Fi 7 router will still work with a device that has only Wi-Fi 6. Likewise, you can use a Wi-Fi 6 router to game on a PS5 Pro -- you just won't be able to fully take advantage of its improved speeds. Single routers vs. mesh systemsMesh routers use multiple devices to relay a better Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, with fewer dead zones. They're likely the right approach if you live in a large, multistory home or if there are multiple spots where you can't connect as reliably as you'd like.There are many great mesh systems available at this point, and prices have come down significantly in the last few years. For more information and our top recommendations, be sure to check out our full rundown of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems of the year.Speed ratings demystifiedWhen shopping for Wi-Fi routers, you'll often see designations like "AC1900" or "AC3150." The idea is to give you a quick sense of which version of Wi-Fi a given router supports ("AC" for Wi-Fi 5, "AX" for Wi-Fi 6, and so on) as well as its speeds. Take that speed number with a big grain of salt. It tells you the sum total of the maximum theoretical transfer rates across each of the router's bands, which will almost always be much higher than the speeds you get as a user. Take our top overall pick, the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX6000. The "AX6000" tells you it's a Wi-Fi 6 router that supports speeds of up to 6,000Mbps. When you add up the two bands, you'll get to 6,000Mbps, but you won't necessarily be able to get all that speed on one device. Even that's probably a stretch, as those top speeds are measured in optimized lab conditions, not real-world environments. The exception to this rule is if you're using a Wi-Fi 7 router with a Wi-Fi 7 device. In that case, your router will be able to use Multi-Link Operation to connect to different bands at the same time. Coverage considerationsWill a single wireless router be able to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal throughout your entire home? No matter how good the router, you'll always see a significant speed drop-off in rooms far away from the router.
Even our pick for the best Wi-Fi router for larger homes, the Asus RT-AX86U Pro, experienced some drop-off across CNET's 12,500-square-foot testing facility. Samantha De Leon/CNETMany Wi-Fi routers list coverage areas north of 5,000 square feet, but I recommend switching to a mesh system if your home is larger than 2,500 square feet. That said, it's a matter of percentages. If you have a multigig internet plan, you'll still get plenty of speed for streaming TV or browsing social media in a far corner of a 5,000-square-foot home. But you'll probably have issues if you're starting with only 100Mbps.Additionally, the type of home you live in -- not just the size -- can affect your Wi-Fi signal."A lot of it depends upon housing construction," said De Leon. "I've got family down in Puerto Rico and Florida, where a lot of the houses are concrete, and that obviously just destroys Wi-Fi signals."Frequency bands and channel widthYou can think of your router like a radio -- it sends and receives signals through airwaves. Whereas a radio picks up audio broadcasts in AM or FM airwaves, a Wi-Fi router sends and receives data through 2.4 and 5GHz airwaves (as well as 6GHz airwaves if it's a fancy Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 router). Nearly all routers include separate radios for those bands, which lets you connect to whichever band is best. Some routers will automatically steer your connection between the multiple bands available, but you can usually turn that off as well, making each band its own, separate Wi-Fi network. The 2.4GHz band offers a better range than higher bands, but speeds are limited. With 5GHz (or 6GHz), you can hit much faster speeds, but those speeds will drop off faster than you'll see with 2.4GHz as your device's distance from the router increases.In general, the 5GHz band is your best bet for a reliable, high-speed connection at close and medium range, and the 2.4GHz band is great for devices at the far reaches of your Wi-Fi network, where the improved range is worth the speed trade-off.Ethernet and USB connectivityTypically, the more high-end the router, the more Ethernet ports you'll see. These let you plug a device directly into your router. A wired connection is inherently much stronger than Wi-Fi; in one test, a CNET writer got 395Mbps download speeds through Ethernet and 126Mbps through Wi-Fi. If there's one device that you absolutely want to get the best connection to, an Ethernet cable is the way to go. Ports are often marketed as "gigabit Ethernet ports," which means they're capable of delivering gigabit speeds through a wired connection. The more ports a router has, the more devices you can connect this way. USB ports on Wi-Fi routers have several different use cases. You can use them to connect devices like printers directly to your router, which allows you to share them with the rest of the devices on the network. You can also attach an external hard drive to the router to share its contents with other devices on the network. Security featuresAny router you look at should have WPA3 certification at minimum. This is the most recent security protocol issued by the Wi-Fi Alliance, and it ensures that the router follows best practices that encrypt data and make passwords harder to crack. "Honestly, as long as it has WPA3, that's probably the big security thing to look for," said De Leon.He also recommended looking for routers that support automatic firmware updates. Not all the routers CNET recommends automatically update firmware. One of the manufacturers I spoke with said it's received "quite vocal feedback from the community" against them, as they can affect network performance. Whether they're automatic or not, the main thing to know is that the manufacturer regularly issues updates and that they're easy to install. QoS and traffic managementMany routers come with Quality of Service (QoS) settings that let you prioritize specific devices on the network. If you wanted to make sure your work computer was in line ahead of your kid's Nintendo Switch, for instance, you could adjust this in the settings. Our best overall router, the Asus ROG Rapture GT-AX6000, has traffic management settings designed specifically for gaming, but you could use them on any device you want to get the best connection.Parental controls and family featuresMost routers these days come with some form of parental controls. These can usually be set through the router's app, and they let you automatically restrict access to specific websites or any adult content. You can often set up a schedule for when a device can access Wi-Fi, or even set daily limits. Smart home integrationSome routers, like the Eero series, work with voice assistants like Alexa to let you control the router with your voice. You can also use Amazon Echo devices as mesh nodes and access points with your network. Others, like TP-Link, let you control Tapo, Kasa, Philips Hue and Matter smart home devices through the TP-Link Deco app. Mobile apps and managementApp management is the norm for routers these days. All our top picks can be set up through the smartphone app -- most of them require it -- and you can control your network through the app as well. This lets you see which devices are connected to your router, manage your network remotely or set up parental controls.Processor and RAMThe processor in a Wi-Fi router is like its brain. It determines how well the device can manage your network's traffic and perform multiple tasks simultaneously. All our top picks use a quad-core processor (when publicly listed), which is the standard in 2025. Not all quad-core processors are created equal, though. The A73 processor used by the Eero Max 7, for example, is considered significantly more advanced than the A53 processor used in the Eero Pro 6E. A router's storage capacity can also affect how well it performs. This is usually broken up into RAM and flash. RAM, short for random-access memory, affects the router's ability to process data, while flash storage typically houses the router's settings. Mesh expandabilityIf you're not sure whether a standalone router or a full-fledged mesh system is right for your home, some routers offer a nice middle ground, allowing you to add more routers to create a mesh system later on. You'll be limited to buying another router from the same brand (and possibly product line), but it's a nice option if you don't want to invest in a mesh router right off the bat. Budget considerationsHow much you should spend on a Wi-Fi router depends on what you need and how many people and devices need to connect, but a small- to medium-size home or apartment can probably get by with a well-tested dual-band router in the $130 range. If your home is larger, it's probably worth spending more on a mesh system that can spread more consistent speeds from room to room. If you're working from home, gaming online or sharing bandwidth with multiple housemates or family members, upgrading to something like a high-speed tri-band router is probably a good investment too. How we test Wi-Fi routers
CNET uses custom-made scripts to carry out our testing and data analysis. We focus on three main measurements when testing routers: speed, reliability and distance. We want to know how well a router will translate the internet coming in from your provider to a wireless connection, and we want to know how far it can do it -- even with obstacles like walls and floors in the way. To capture all three of these measurements, we conduct two types of tests: data throughput and signal strength. CNET's testing is unique because we entirely remove the internet provider from the equation. Even the most reliable internet connections are fairly erratic: Factors like time of day, network congestion and even the condition of your neighborhood's broadband infrastructure can all affect your internet speed. To make sure these variables didn't skew our analysis of each router, we set up a separate server to measure the raw throughput of data from the router to a device, bypassing the need for an internet connection entirely.  Learn more: How We Test Wi-Fi RoutersData throughput tests
Here I am running a throughput test close to the router.
Adam Breeden/CNETTo see how fast a router will perform in real-world conditions, we measure its throughput, or the volume of data the router actually transmits during a period of time. All Wi-Fi signals travel through 2.5GHz and 5GHz radio frequencies -- that's why most routers you'll see are referred to as "dual-band." (Tri-band routers use an extra set of channels in the 6GHz band.) To start, we conduct a wired measurement on the 2.5GHz, 5GHz and, when available, 6GHz bands to establish a baseline. This is as fast as throughput can get for the router over each band, so it's a good point of comparison for our wireless tests. From there, we take five different wireless throughput measurements, 60 seconds each, mimicking a household with five devices connected to the router with different throughput needs. These wireless measurements are taken from three different distances from the router: 7 feet, 25 feet and 50 feet. As any online gamer or remote worker can tell you, speed isn't the only factor in evaluating routers. Just as important is jitter, which measures the variations in latency, or the time it takes for data to arrive at its destination. When you're in a video meeting and there's a delay in audio or someone's video freezes, jitter is the culprit. We felt jitter was a better measure than latency when evaluating a router, as average latency can show up in testing as low, even when an internet connection is glitchy.  These tests also captured packet loss, which tells us whether any data failed to reach its destination during the test. You'll often see packet loss as a frozen video screen or a garbled voice during a video call. With both packet loss and jitter, a lower score is better. Signal strength
CNET Labs technician Samantha De Leon makes her way around the facility's 61 marked locations to test each router's signal strength.
Adam Breeden/CNET
Signal-strength tests are taken at 61 marked locations around CNET's labs for each router's 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequency bands.  Samantha De Leon/CNETThe second step in our testing is to measure each router's wireless signal strength and broadcasting capability. To capture this, we used NetSpot, a wireless site-survey and analysis tool. This test also shows how well a router handles interference from other objects and networks you'd find in your home, like TVs or your neighbor's Wi-Fi. CNET's labs have many electronics being tested around the facility, and it shares walls with other businesses, so there's plenty of interference for a router to work through. We taped targets in 61 locations around CNET's 12,500-square-foot testing facility to see how well each router transmitted data past obstacles like walls and electronics. As expected, the 2.4GHz band had better range than the 5GHz band, which sends a stronger signal at a closer range.
The Asus RT-AX86U Pro, our pick for the best router for larger homes, had excellent range on the 2.4GHz band, pictured above. Samantha De Leon/CNETIn the signal-strength maps, the numbers refer to decibels relative to a milliwatt (dBm), and they indicate how strong the Wi-Fi signal is at a given location. A value like -55 dBm is considered strong enough and typically correlates with high throughput. Here's how to interpret the numbers on signal-strength maps:-15 dBm -- Extremely strong (almost on top of the router)-30 dBm -- Excellent signal-45 dBm -- Very good signal-60 dBm -- Good, supports most tasks-75 dBm -- Weak, may see drops in speed/stability< -80 dBm -- Very poor, likely unstable or unusableIn the example above, the Asus RT-AX86U Pro never dipped below -55dBm -- even when it was on the other side of the 12,500-square-foot lab. That's incredible range for a standalone Wi-Fi router.  Other Wi-Fi routers we tested
In total, we tested 31 routers at CNET's lab in this initial round, and we're constantly trying out new models as they become available. Here are some other solid performers, which barely missed out on being top picks. Netgear Nighthawk RS700S: A close second place for the best Wi-Fi 7 router. It was the fastest router we tested on the 6GHz band, but it finished near last place on 5GHz. That might not be a big deal if all your devices are Wi-Fi 7 compatible, but that's not the case for most of us. If you're going to spend $500 on a router, the Eero Max 7 is a more well-rounded choice. Netgear Nighthawk RS300: There's a ton of value here. A tri-band Wi-Fi 7 router for under $300 is a rarity, and the Nighthawk RS300 delivered on every single band. Ultimately, the Eero Max 7 was slightly faster on each band and had better all-around jitter and packet loss results, so it earned our top pick for the best Wi-Fi 7 router. But at half the cost, the Nighthawk RS300 isn't a huge step down in performance.   Synology WRX560: This Wi-Fi router actually scored first place in our 2.4GHz tests, earning a throughput score of 127Mbps. But everywhere else, it lagged behind. It was the 19th fastest router on the 5GHz band, and its packet loss scores were close to the bottom. That might be forgivable for a budget router, but at $243, the WRX50 is definitely not that.TP-Link Archer AX21: At $55, this was one of the cheapest Wi-Fi routers we tested, and it generally performed like it. It ranked 20th in throughput on the 2.4GHz band and 17th on 5GHz. That sounds pretty mediocre, but it translates to 700Mbps on 5GHz -- far more horsepower than most homes need -- and its signal strength was impressive, too. I still think it's worth paying a bit more for the TP-Link Deco X55 Pro, but if you're looking for the absolute cheapest router you can find that still works, the AX21 is a worthy option. TP-Link Archer AX55: The AX55 ($70) is a popular pick on other "best Wi-Fi routers" pages, and I was anxious to see how it landed in our tests. Ultimately, it landed with a thud. The dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router ranked in the bottom third for throughput on both bands, and though its jitter scores were acceptable, they certainly weren't a strength. About the only thing the AX55 had going for it was decent signal strength. TP-Link's Archer AX21 ($55) and Deco X55 Pro ($68) both offer much better all-around performance. TP-Link Archer AXE75: A tri-band Wi-Fi 6E router for $130 sounds a little too good to be true. In fact, TP-Link is currently being investigated by the US Justice Department for potentially selling goods below cost (more on that below). But there's no denying this router's value. It performed well on all three bands, and though it's missing some of the newer features of Wi-Fi 7, it still gets you access to the ultrawide 6GHz band for an incredible price.
Wi-Fi Router FAQ
When should you get a new Wi-Fi router?
There are two situations in which I'd recommend upgrading your router: if you're experiencing connectivity issues or if the manufacturer stops issuing firmware updates, which usually happens about five years after a device's release.You should generally upgrade your router only if you're having issues with it -- if your connection drops out regularly, you're getting a spotty signal in some rooms, or a buffering wheel appears every time you try to stream something. In short, if you're noticing your router at all, it's probably time to upgrade it.  Router technology moves fast. A few years ago, Wi-Fi 6 models were the hottest new routers on the market. Fast-forward to 2025, and some brands have shelved their Wi-Fi 6 routers in favor of faster Wi-Fi 7 options. If you've bought a new device in the past year, like the iPhone 16 or the PS5 Pro, it probably supports the newer Wi-Fi 7 standard. That means if you want to maximize your phone's speeds, you'll need a router that can take advantage of it. On top of that, a growing number of mesh router options are well worth considering, particularly since many of them are far less expensive than the router combo systems that came before them.
What does a Wi-Fi router do?
You need to be connected to your modem to send and receive data from the web; your router lets you do that without the need for a wire. It's effectively a big, fancy antenna for your modem that lets you connect with it wirelessly, over Wi-Fi. You can also use that local Wi-Fi network to connect with other devices at home, like printers or remote storage servers.
Do I need a mesh Wi-Fi system or is a single router enough?
Mesh routers use multiple devices to relay a better Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, with fewer dead zones. They're likely the right approach if you live in a large, multistory home or if there are multiple spots where you can't connect as reliably as you'd like.There are many great mesh systems available, and prices have come down significantly in the last few years. For more information and our top recommendations, check out our full rundown of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems of the year.
What security features should I look for in a Wi-Fi router?
The two major security features you should look for in a Wi-Fi router are WPA3 certification and regular firmware updates. All the routers we recommend are WPA3 certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance. Ensuring the manufacturer is still issuing firmware updates for the router is also essential -- and it's even better if they're done automatically. "Additional optional features include parental controls, device and traffic monitoring, and MAC address filtering, which all enable an additional level of control over the users on a network," said David Coleman, the director of wireless networking at Extreme Networks.
How do I optimize router placement for the best coverage?
Place your router in a central location in the home, off the ground, and away from walls. "The main factor you have to consider is that Wi-Fi travels very well over open air, and it travels very poorly through hard material," Julian, a technician with ThoseTechGuys in Renton, Washington, told me in a previous interview. "The best place to put a router is centrally located out in the open away from any cabinets, kitchen, plumbing, walls, things like that."
How do I set up a Wi-Fi router?
The old-fashioned way is to plug the thing in and connect it to your modem via Ethernet cable, then type its IP address into a browser's URL bar to begin the setup. The easier, more modern way is to use the router's app, which will typically walk you through setup in about 5 to 10 minutes. After setup, you can also use either approach to access the router's settings or change your Wi-Fi password.
How much should I spend on a router?
It depends on what you need and how many people and devices need to connect, but a small- to medium-size home or apartment can probably get by with a well-tested dual-band router in the $130 range. If your home is larger, it's probably worth spending more on a mesh system that can spread more consistent speeds from room to room. If you're working from home, gaming online or sharing bandwidth with multiple housemates or family members, upgrading to a high-speed tri-band router is probably a good investment, too.
