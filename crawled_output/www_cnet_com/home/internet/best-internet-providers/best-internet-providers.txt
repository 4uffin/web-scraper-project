Best internet providers FAQ
Moving or just looking to jump broadband service providers? It's always an endless chore. CNET's broadband experts have spent years digging out the best options and we know how overwhelming it can be if you're unsure what to look out for. That's why CNET's expert team has cut through the noise to highlight the best options available for you factoring in speed, price, reliability and connection type. Bookmark this page, here's everything you need to find the top internet service that fits your home perfectly. What's the best internet provider overall?Verizon Fios and AT&T Fiber are two providers that stand out as the best internet service providers overall.Those in the Northeast will have a tough time finding a better ISP than Verizon Fios, while many in the South and Midwest will find AT&T Fiber the best option. As we often say in our ISP reviews, fiber internet almost always trumps other internet connection types. Don't hesitate to sign up if you can get fiber broadband at your address for a reasonable price.
AT&T Fiber and Verizon Fios are two of our top ISPs. Sarah Tew/CNETThere are times when cable internet, like that of Xfinity, Spectrum and Cox, is the best option. Cable is often a solid choice for cheap internet, which could be important because a recent CNET survey showed that 63% of adults paid more for internet service last year than they did the year prior. Cable can also be a fine option if you're interested in bundling internet and TV, or internet and mobile. Cable internet boasts the highest availability of any non-satellite connection type, often making it the best option if there are no fiber providers in your area. Let's look at which internet providers made CNET's cut.
Our methodology
CNET considers speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to recommend the best internet service providers across several categories. Our evaluation includes referencing a proprietary database built over years of reviewing internet services. We validate that against provider information by spot-checking local addresses for service availability. We also closely read providers' terms and conditions and, when needed, call ISPs to verify the details.Despite our efforts to find the most recent and accurate information, our process has some limitations you should know about. Pricing and speed data are variable: Certain addresses may qualify for different service tiers, and monthly costs may vary, even within a city. The best way to identify your options is to plug your address into a provider's website. Also, the prices, speed and other information listed above and in the provider cards below may differ from what we found in our research. The cards display the full range of a provider's pricing and speed across the US, according to our database of plan information provided directly by ISPs. At the same time, the plan charts display the offerings most common to most areas. The prices referenced within this article's text come from our research and include applicable discounts for setting up automatic payments each month -- a standard industry offering. Discounts and promotions might also be available for signing a term contract or bundling multiple services. To learn more about how we review internet providers, visit our full methodology page.

Best fiber internet provider
Our take - It's not the cheapest internet provider, but in terms of overall value, AT&T Fiber is one of the best. Considering cost-per-Mbps, which is a way of comparing apples to apples, AT&T Fiber is one of the top values out there. Free equipment rental, unlimited data and no set price increases add to the provider's overall appeal.

Pros and Cons
Pros No contracts required to receive the lowest available price
No data caps for any fiber plans
Valuable perks and promotional offers
Cons
Much slower DSL plans are more prevalent than fiber options
Data caps enforced on all non-fiber plans
For comparison, you can expect Verizon's average fiber internet plan to cost you 11 cents per Mbps. Meanwhile, most cable internet plans from names like Xfinity will typically cost you at least 17 cents per Mbps, if not more. Another point worth mentioning: AT&T offers multi-gig plans with symmetrical upload and download speeds of 2 and 5 gigabits per second.
Fair pricing and simple service terms have helped make AT&T Fiber one of the highest-ranked internet service providers for customer satisfaction by the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. The telecom giant's DSL and fixed wireless plans are much less impressive, but if AT&T Fiber is available at your address, consider yourself lucky because there isn't much reason to consider anything else.

T-Mobile 5G Home Internet has the greatest nationwide coverage of any single internet provider (apart from satellite internet), boasting a 60% availability, according to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission. That's why we voted T-Mobile as the best rural internet provider. When you're rurally located, your chances of getting cable or fiber are much lower. To avoid the high costs and traditionally slow speeds of satellite internet, T-Mobile is an excellent alternative.

Pros and Cons
Pros Straightforward pricing
No data caps on any plans
No contracts required for internet service
Free access to Spectrum's nationwide Wi-Fi hotspots
Cons Competitive rates for cable, but pricier than many fiber providers
Internet service is slightly below the industry average for customer satisfaction
Spectrum isn't the biggest name in cable internet -- that'd be Comcast's Xfinity -- but it still offers service to approximately 30 million customers, according to Spectrum's first quarter 2025 report. Unlike Comcast (or Cox, its other main cable rival), Spectrum doesn't enforce a data cap and won't tie you down to a long-term contract.
On top of all that, Spectrum's prices and terms are straightforward, easy to understand and easy to live with. It isn't quite the best value in the cable category (keep reading), and Spectrum prices usually increase by $30 monthly after one year, but Spectrum is still your top option for cable internet at home when you drill down into the details.

No data caps or allowances on any plans
No term agreements necessary on any plans
Cons Low fiber availability for a national company
While Fios and 5G are affordable, LTE and DSL options are pricey
What do people like about Verizon? For starters, while the company's DSL service isn't special, most customers across the company's eight-state coverage map in the northeast have access to Verizon Fios fiber service capable of gigabit speeds and uploads as fast as the downloads. Verizon plans don't come with contracts or data caps and your price won't automatically go up after a year the way it will with most other providers.
What's more, Verizon 5G Home Internet is now available in more than 15 million homes in the country, per the company's website. Given the nationwide need for better internet options, this is a promising development for consumers.

WideOpenWest
Best internet provider for value Our take - WideOpenWest is a relatively small provider that offers services in six states. It earns the exclamation point it likes to stick at the end of its branding by offering cable internet plans at some of the best prices you'll find anywhere in the US. That includes an entry-level 300Mbps plan that starts at $30 per month, reaching all the way up to a high-speed 1,200Mbps plan at $95 monthly. That's a stellar cost per Mbps of just 8 cents, which is unheard of in the cable category. In some areas, for an extra $5 a month, WOW offers price-lock to your chosen plan to protect against sudden price increases.

Cons Limited availability, just six states Service interruptions can be a bit too frequent, depending on location
In addition, WOW doesn't enforce annual contracts with any of its plans, and it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee when you sign up, letting you cancel without penalty if it isn't the right fit. All in, it's about as strong as ISP sales pitches get, I just wish the footprint was a bit bigger.

Quantum Fiber
Worth a look if service is available Our take - CenturyLink offers DSL internet plans across 16 states, but roughly half of the coverage map also has access to its sibling company's fiber plans, branded as Quantum Fiber. Overall, the plans offer decent cost per Mbps, with the entry-level plan starting at $50 monthly for matching upload and download speeds of 500Mbps (10 cents per Mbps), all the way up to $165 a month for 8 gigabits with matching speeds of 8,000Mbps. There are no data caps or contracts with those plans, and, best of all, the ISP offers a price-for-life guarantee, pledging to never raise your rate for as long as you keep your plan.

Rise Broadband
Convenient alternative rural internet provider Our take - Pickings can be frustratingly slim when shopping for an internet plan in a rural area because most of the best internet infrastructure in the country is centralized in population-dense cities and the suburban neighborhoods surrounding them. If you live outside a region like that, your home probably isn't wired for fiber or cable. Instead, you'll have to make do with slower, less reliable and more expensive technologies, and you'll likely have fewer options to choose from too.

Cons Max speeds of only 100Mbps in most areas

Possible service disruptions in bad weather
You'll need to take the good with the bad with just about any rural ISP, but there's more good than bad with Rise Broadband. A fixed wireless provider covering much of the country's middle, Rise Broadband will beam an internet signal directly to an antenna mounted outside your home, providing download speeds of up to 100Mbps for $75 monthly. That matches the top end of what you'll get with a satellite internet plan from Hughesnet and is faster than many DSL plans, which often struggle to surpass double-digit download speeds.
Rise also recently introduced fiber internet packages: 300Mbps, 500Mbps and 1,000Mbps, but these plans are even more scarce nationwide than Rise's fixed wireless plans.

Google Fiber
Great value for high-speed internet Our take - It's been over a decade since Google first announced that it would bring fiber internet service to select regions across the country -- and it's been an interesting ride ever since. After initially rolling out across 11 metro areas, Google struggled to build the service beyond that. It paused its efforts in 2016, leaving disappointment across dozens of cities where the company had teased prospects for future fiber expansions.

Viasat
Best if you're stuck with satellite Our take - Satellite internet is typically slow, laggy and temperamental in inclement weather, so I'd explore other options if you've got them. That's the issue; too many of us don't have other options, and satellite internet from established names like Viasat and Hughesnet are available just about everywhere.

Viasat continues to improve top download speeds
Cons High prices that increase after just three months
Speeds no better than 12Mbps in some areas
High latency and service disruptions are common with satellite internet
If it comes down to those two, I'd start with Viasat. Why? Neither offers strong value for what you're getting, but Hughesnet caps the maximum download speeds at 100GB to 200GB of priority data. Viasat's newest plan, Viasat Unleashed, offers satellite speeds of up to 150Mbps and is available in some regions.
All of that said, there are aspects of Viasat's service that would probably be more at home on a "worst list" than a "best list" like this. For starters, "unlimited data" isn't truly unlimited. If you exceed 850GB in 30 days, your speeds will be slowed. Yes, you won't incur any added fees, but your service will be affected. Make sure to shop around for other, better options in your area. If there aren't any, Viasat is a workable choice for getting online in remote parts of the country.

Plans are limited for now, with a notable lack of middle-ground options between the lowest and fastest speed tiers. In addition to offering multi-gig plans of 2, 5 and 10 gigabits per second, the provider added a 50-gig tier to its lineup for a hefty $900 monthly, making it the fastest provider in the country.
Ziply also includes whole-home Wi-Fi with up to three extenders, which is a nice deal for anyone interested in trying out the benefits of a mesh network. Customers also have an option to use their own router or lease one for $15 per month. We'll keep an eye on the company as it grows, but we like what we see.

Please note that the plans below show each provider's cheapest available tier. The maximum speed is the top advertised speed for that given plan, but it might not be available in your area. Overall, the best selection for you -- and the most cost-effective plan -- might be a different tier that provides a faster speed at a higher price but a better value.

Source: CNET analysis of provider data.How to choose the best internet service provider for your home Finding the right ISP for your household isn't easy. This is especially true if you live in a rural or underserved portion of the US. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine the download and upload speeds necessary to meet your needs. With that knowledge, you can better tackle plan pricing that will fit your budget and broadband demands.For more comprehensive tips on finding the top internet plan for your household, check out CNET's 10 tips to help you get the most out of your internet service.Download and upload speedsFor most of us, our internet use mainly focuses on our download speeds. Your download speed determines how easily you can stream the latest hit Netflix show or how fast you can load your favorite Amazon shopping page. The slower your download speeds, the longer it takes to do tasks on the internet. For example, Netflix suggests 15Mbps or higher to watch programming in ultra HD (to take full advantage of that 4K TV you bought). As for uploads, most of us couldn't care less about our upload speeds before the pandemic. Once we started excessively video chatting with friends and family, taking Zoom calls with business colleagues and sending files and homework to our bosses and teachers, we discovered its importance too.Considering what types of activities dominate your household will affect what level of download speed you'll need. Do you work remotely from home? Are you living in a household full of kids with their own devices? Have you recently downsized and are an empty nester? Take stock of how many devices are in your home and what kind of internet users you have. You can refer to our internet speed guide for a quick explainer on determining what speeds you may need.Plan pricingAt first glance, you might think it's easy to spot good plan pricing. The cheaper the monthly fee, the better the price, right? Maybe. Because internet providers are not the most transparent (a Consumer Reports broadband study noted that customers found internet bills to be "extremely confusing"), one low monthly rate might not equal the next. Keep an eye out for promo rates that expire quickly. Most enticing, low starting prices won't last, and you may pay more for low speeds in the long term. Also, look for hidden fees and/or pricing traps that may add to your monthly expenses. For example, some providers don't include equipment rentals in their monthly rates. That could add another $5 to $15 to your monthly bill. Lastly, one good way to determine value is by examining the cost per Mbps. You might find a 75Mbps plan for $20 monthly from one provider and a 250Mbps plan for $30 monthly from another. Before you sign up for that $20 plan, consider that the cost per Mbps is just under 27 cents. The 250Mbps plan, on the other hand, chimes in at 12 cents per Mbps, so it's a better value -- more than 50% cheaper per Mbps -- and you get more than three times the download speed.Customer satisfactionJust as you might search the internet for recommendations on a good local restaurant, it can be helpful to research customers' experiences with an ISP before you sign up. CNET has found it helpful to lean on the annual ISP surveys from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, but many resources are available. Learning about constant network interruptions, a negligent help desk or frequent billing mistakes can be valuable info for choosing (or avoiding) certain providers.Internet connection typesThere are six major types of internet available: fiber, cable, 5G, fixed wireless, DSL and satellite. Each of these internet technologies provides different quirks and benefits. Our CNET experts share their experiences with each internet connection type to better illustrate some differences.FiberFiber internet is the gold standard if you can get it. It's often called "future-proof," meaning that it offers some of the fastest plans available and features symmetrical download and upload speeds. It's more reliable than cable and is less prone to outages or network congestion. AT&T, Google and Verizon are among the major players that offer fiber-optic internet, but unfortunately, fiber internet is one of the least available internet connection types in the country. To learn whether this connection is right for your household, read our explainer on fiber internet.CableCable internet supplies your internet connection through the same cables (often a hybrid fiber and copper line) that providers use for TV services. It's more reliable than satellite internet and offers faster download speeds. Often, cable internet is bundled with TV to get consumers to buy higher-priced packages to get a deal on internet service. Companies like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity offer cable internet for competitive prices.5G home internet/Fixed wireless 5G home internet and fixed wireless go hand-in-hand: 5G home internet services are fixed wireless internet services. Not all fixed wireless services are 5G home internet offerings. Fixed wireless service means the connection between your provider and home is not wired. That fixed wireless connection can come via cellular networks or satellite. Fixed wireless networks tend to be slower and more laggy than wired connections. You're also subject to network congestion and speed throttling during peak usage hours. The promise of 5G home internet from companies like Starry, T-Mobile and Verizon is speeds that match up favorably to cable connections. Is it there yet? Not quite, but my CNET colleague is optimistic about 5G home internet's potential.DSLDSL, or digital subscriber line, uses telephone lines to provide internet connectivity to users. Companies like AT&T, CenturyLink and Frontier offer DSL internet. The good news is those copper lines are prevalent across the country. The not-so-good news is that download speeds fall short of what cable internet can offer. In some cases, your speeds might even be slower than satellite internet.SatelliteSatellite internet is the one broadband connection type currently available to people in the rural areas of all 50 states. As a solid alternative for those without access to DSL, cable or fiber internet, satellite internet links a modem in your home to a satellite in space, sending the internet back to Earth. Typically, satellite internet features slower speeds -- though Starlink has certainly disrupted expectations for satellite internet and raised the bar way up. Note that, like 5G home internet and other fixed wireless offerings, satellite internet is subject to network congestion and speed throttling. How CNET chose the best internet providers Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. It doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? The answers to those questions are often layered and complex, but the providers that come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.What's the final word on the best internet providers?Finding the right ISP is easier said than done, especially if you live in a rural part of the country with limited options for getting online. Fiber internet is almost always the best internet connection type, but we recognize that many Americans don't currently have access to fiber internet.Some providers we listed might not be the perfect fit for your situation. Often, the best provider is simply the one available at your address. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine your broadband demands. Best internet providers FAQ
What's the cheapest way to get internet?
That depends. One of the cheapest ways to get internet service is through government programs available for low-income families, as well as for seniors and students. To find out what low-cost internet programs are available at your address, check out our low-income state-by-state internet guide. Lastly, you can try negotiating with your current internet provider to secure a lower rate on your broadband service. You can also keep your eyes open for internet providers that offer cheap internet, broadband deals or other internet promotions each month.

What's the fastest internet provider?
The good news is that gigabit plans are now common and offered by almost all major ISPs. As we often say, the fastest internet service for you will depend on your location and specific address. Xfinity and Optimum often extend the fastest plans available for residential homes, with a 10,000Mbps and an 8,000Mbps plan, respectively. Those aren't as widely available and may require a site survey to ensure serviceability.In 2022, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, provider announced it was offering a 25Gbps plan. Although that's impressive, Ziply Fiber subsequently released a 50-gigabit plan. That's ridiculously fast and pretty cool, though you probably don't need that much speed in your household. To avoid paying for speeds you don't need, read our guide on how much speed your household needs.

What is the most powerful internet company?
If fast is what you’re looking for, Ziply Fiber has two of the fastest internet plans of any major ISP, with advertised symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 10,000Mbps and 50,000Mbps. If you're more interested in customer care and value, Verizon offers the best sign-up bonuses among high-speed internet providers.
Show more
What provider has the best Wi-Fi coverage?
Since internet providers tend to operate in specific areas, the provider with the best Wi-Fi coverage will depend on where you live. Currently, T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is available in 49 states and has 65% nationwide coverage.
Show more
What internet speed do I need?
In March of 2024, the FCC raised the minimum standard of "broadband speeds" to 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. Most providers now offer a gigabit plan, but most households won't need that much speed. According to OpenVault's first quarter 2024 report, the average American household uses approximately 520Mbps download speeds (although nearly 33% of households get less than 200 to 400Mbps). Does that mean you'll need that much? Not necessarily. The internet speed you need will depend on how many people use the internet in your home and for what activities.
Show more
Should I self-install my internet or have a professional do it?
Most internet providers offer a self-installation option, where they'll mail you your home internet equipment after you sign up for service, and you'll set it up yourself on your own time. In most cases, the process is straightforward, with clear instructions on how to plug everything in correctly. In some cases, opting for self-installation can save you money, too.All of that makes self-installation a great option for homes that don't require much labor to get a network up and running -- for instance, if you're setting up a cable internet modem and your home already has the necessary coaxial wiring running through your walls. Check with your provider when you sign up to see if it's an option for you, how much work it would entail and how much money you could save compared to letting the pros handle it.
Show more
What is a Tier 1 ISP?
Tier 1 internet providers have direct access to the network, letting them offer services directly to customers without relying on other providers. A few Tier 1 ISPs include AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink, which all have extensive networks and complete control of their network and routing.
Show more
How many ISPs are there in the US?
Approximately 2,000 ISPs operate in the US, including national, regional and local providers. Some offer nationwide coverage, but others cater to specific areas or communities.

Which internet service providers offer bundles?
If you’re considering home internet and TV service, bundling can save you time and money. Companies like AT&T, Cox Communications and Frontier offer internet and television packages, but you can read more at CNET's list of the best internet and TV bundles and or internet and mobile bundles. Other providers like Astound, Spectrum, T-Mobile and Verizon may offer to bundle your internet with a mobile plan.
