Satellite internet FAQs
Depending on where you live, satellite internet might be the only internet connection type that can reach you. That makes it critical for rural households. Its wide availability comes from how it works.
Fixed wireless internet connects your modem to satellites orbiting overhead. With just a dish and an open view of the sky, you can get online even if wired services such as cable, DSL or fiber aren't available. While satellite internet can't compete with fiber or cable when it comes to speed, it fills an important gap in internet access. For most people, the choice of satellite provider will come down to Starlink, Hughesnet or Viasat. The question is: Which one offers the right balance of price, performance and availability for your home? What is the best satellite internet provider?Starlink boasts the greatest potential, Hughesnet features the most reliable speeds and affordable prices, and Viasat's unlimited data plan could attract customers.We've carefully examined the available options, considering speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to assemble your top internet options. Here's a look at how the best satellite internet providers compare. Read more: Could 5G Home Internet Be the Answer to Your Broadband Needs?Satellite internet provider comparisonPlease note that the plans below show each provider's cheapest available tier. The max speed is the top advertised speed for that given plan, but it might not be available in your area. Overall, the best selection for you -- and the most cost-effective plan -- might be a different tier that provides a faster speed at a higher price but a better value. To better understand this value-based approach, check out CNET's guide to examining the cost per Mbps.

First, at 100Mbps to 350Mbps, the maximum download speeds are higher than those from Hughesnet and Viasat. Starlink also offers lower latency -- between 25 and 60 milliseconds -- compared with Hughesnet and Viasat's more typical range of 450ms to 700ms. Latency could be even lower in the near future as the company works on reducing it to a stable 20ms. According to Ookla speed test data from earlier this year, Starlink is showing significant progress. "The fact that Starlink's median download speeds nearly doubled from Q3 2022 to Q1 2025 is definitely a notable and impressive development," said Sue Marek, editorial director at Ookla. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Add to that the fact that Starlink is available to every ZIP code in the US, making it even more impressive.
Second, Starlink began with only two satellite internet plans: Starlink Standard and Starlink Priority. The Priority plan, which starts at $65 monthly, offers a pool of priority data that may result in faster speeds than Standard data. The Priority plan was recently rebranded as a "Fixed Site" business plan, but residential customers can still take advantage of its priority data plans.
Lastly, paying for equipment can get pretty steep. Standard customers can expect a $349 equipment fee, but this is regularly discounted (right now you can pick up the equipment for just $89). This is also the case for mobile customers, but hardware can reach upward of $1,499 for Priority customers. Whichever plan you choose, the equipment fees are higher than the ones you'll find with Hughesnet and Viasat. On the other hand, Starlink doesn't require a two-year contract. Once you consider the decent upload speed, these are considerable upgrades for anyone who has to turn to satellite internet. Those facts could change as Starlink grows, but for now they’re intriguing parts of the pitch that may help set it apart from the competition.

Hughesnet
Best satellite internet for reliable speeds Our take - Hughesnet's plans score strong points for their download speeds and consistency. Customers have seen speeds of up to 100Mbps ever since Hughesnet launched its Jupiter 3 satellite into orbit in 2023. On top of that, Hughesnet is available to customers in the most remote areas. Moreover, a Federal Communications Commission report on broadband in 2018 (the last time Hughesnet participated in the FCC study) noted that Hughesnet fared best among all participating providers for delivering actual median download speed at 150% or higher of the advertised speed.

Cons Two-year contract, with early termination fees if you cancelUnlimited data is misleading -- Hughesnet will impose severe speed reductions once you hit your data plan's thresholdHigh equipment costs
Things to consider: While Hughesnet touts unlimited data for all plans, you can expect a soft cap of 100GB to 200GB. Once you hit your monthly data allowance, your speeds will be reduced to 1 to 3 megabits per second. Hughesnet also came up short in the 2023 J.D. Power's US Residential Internet Service Provider Satisfaction Study, landing in last place in its South region for overall customer satisfaction. Neither Starlink, Viasat or Hughesnet placed in the most recent J.D. Power Residential Internet Service Provider Satisfaction Study.

Viasat
Best satellite internet for versatility of plans Our take - Viasat's Unleashed all-in-one plan is changing how customers experience its services. The plan is simple and straightforward and quite a change from the provider's previous approach. The price will vary depending on your location, but you can expect a fixed monthly rate between $70 and $100 and it can deliver speeds up to 150Mbps. Viasat introduced this plan early in March 2024, which doesn't require any annual term agreements. Only new Viasat customers in certain locations are eligible for the no-contract plan. Check your location for serviceability.

While Viasat touts an unlimited data plan, customers exceeding 850GB of data within 30 days may expect slower speeds. Viasat's new plan also adds $15 to your monthly bill for leasing equipment, but you can purchase the equipment for $250 upfront. Finally, installation will cost you up to $500, but is sometimes free for certain addresses.

How we test satellite internet providers Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.It doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. As ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes, all information provided is accurate as of publication.Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying?Are customers happy with their service?The answer to those questions is often layered and complex, but the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend.To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.How to choose a satellite internet providerFinding the right ISP for your household is not easy. This is especially true if you live in an underserved portion of the US. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine the download and upload speeds necessary to meet your needs. With that knowledge, you can better tackle plan pricing that will fit your budget and broadband demands. Finding the right internet plan for your household doesn't have to be complicated; check out CNET's 10 tips to help you get the most out of your internet service.What's next for satellite internet providers?Stay tuned for the latest developments with Starlink as it continues to exceed expectations for satellite internet and outpaces the likes of Hughesnet and Viasat. In 2024, SpaceX rolled out the Starlink Mini, a satellite dish best suited for customers on the go. This product is an all-in-one mini satellite dish and router. Musk conducted a speed test that showed download speeds of up to 100Mbps and 11.5Mbps in uploads for the Starlink Mini, which is pretty fast for a mobile satellite internet connection. Reducing latency for customers nationwide has also been a big focus for Starlink, allowing for better videoconferencing, gaming and live streaming -- tasks previously difficult with slower speeds from competing satellite internet providers.According to Ookla's Q1 2024 speed test report, Starlink's median download speed in the US was 64.54Mbps, which was a 13Mbps increase from the previous report. Viasat was in distant second place with 34.72Mbps download speeds and Hughesnet was in the rear at 15.87Mbps. Ookla's report mentions that Starlink subscribers highly recommend the service and are happy with its internet connectivity. It’s safe to say that expectations of how satellite internet can perform are beginning to change. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)It should also be mentioned that further satellite internet competition will soon come from another multibillionaire, Jeff Bezos, as Amazon's Project Kuiper plans to enter the field. While nowhere near the stage that Starlink has achieved thus far, Project Kuiper's first rocket launch took place in late April, and the service is expected to be available for residential use in the latter half of 2025. Innovations from low-Earth-orbit satellites will be just one piece of the puzzle of better delivering the internet to the millions of households still unable to find a reliable broadband source. We'll keep this post updated as your options (hopefully) improve. Are there any alternative connection types besides satellite internet?Yes. Many broadband connection options may offer faster (and possibly cheaper) service than satellite internet.CableCable internet provides connection through the same cables (often a hybrid fiber and copper line) that providers use to provide TV services. It's more reliable than satellite internet and offers faster download speeds. Most of the time, cable internet is bundled with TV to lure consumers into buying higher-priced packages. Companies like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity offer cable internet. DSL DSL, or digital subscriber line, uses telephone lines to connect users. Companies like AT&T, CenturyLink and Frontier offer DSL Internet. The good news is those copper lines are prevalent across the country. The not-so-good news is that download speeds typically fall short of what cable internet offers and usually fall short of FCC broadband standards. In some cases, your speeds might even be slower than satellite internet.Fixed wireless/5G home internet5G home internet and fixed wireless go hand-in-hand: 5G home internet services are fixed wireless internet services. Not all fixed wireless services are 5G home internet offerings. Are you confused yet? Fixed wireless service means the connection between your provider and your home is not wired. That fixed wireless connection can come via cellular networks (including 3G, 4G, 4G LTE and 5G) and by satellite. Fixed wireless networks tend to be slower and more laggy than wired connections. The promise of 5G home internet -- from Starry, T-Mobile 5G Home Internet and Verizon 5G Home Internet -- is speeds that compare favorably to cable connections.FiberFiber internet is the gold standard of the broadband world. Often referred to as "future proof," fiber internet offers some of the fastest plans available and features symmetrical download and upload speeds. It's more reliable than cable and is less prone to being affected by peak usage times or congestion. The only drawback is the expense and difficulty of creating a fiber network: rural customers are not likely to get fiber installed in their homes, as most fiber internet providers concentrate their efforts around major cities. Companies like AT&T, Google Fiber and Verizon Fios offer fiber-optic internet. To find out more about this connection, read our fiber connectivity explainer. Mobile hotspotsMobile hotspots also use cellular networks, similar to fixed wireless internet, but they are not "fixed." You can use a hotspot at multiple locations and they aren't dependent on your home address. Despite the wide range of options available, each connection type varies in terms of availability, pricing and speeds. Make sure to research and compare the different options to ensure you choose the one that best meets your needs and budget.Satellite internet FAQs
Is satellite internet reliable?
Satellite internet is a reasonably reliable internet connection option for rural or less urbanized areas. It may come with slower speeds than cable and fiber internet providers, but it doesn’t rely on underground wiring like other connection types, which makes it accessible to more locations. On the flip side, bad weather can cause outages or spotty connections to a greater degree than other modes of broadband.

Who is satellite internet best for?
If you live in a remote or rural location, satellite internet may be your best (and possibly only) option for connection. It is the one type of broadband available to people in the rural areas of all 50 states, making it a solid option when other types of connectivity are unavailable.

How much does satellite internet cost?
The price of satellite internet can fluctuate based on your location. If you're in an area where providers are still developing, the price might be higher for connectivity. For Hughesnet, Viasat and Starlink, prices range from $50 to $2,150. In some cases, like Starlink, the monthly price can also vary based on whether you're in a high-demand or low-demand area. We recommend inputting your address on various providers' websites to determine which will offer you the best value at your location.

How fast is satellite internet?
It depends on your internet provider and your plan. Starlink boasts the fastest speeds out of Hughesnet and Viasat. However, even with speeds topping out at 350Mbps, it's still no match to what cable or fiber offers. Fiber ISPs like Ziply Fiber and AT&T offer multi-gig plans that reach up to 10 and 5 gigabits, respectively. Most cable providers like Spectrum and Xfinity offer gigabit plans. At present, satellite connections don't match those speeds. In addition, cable and fiber are far more reliable than satellite.
Is Starlink better than Viasat?
Potentially, yes. If you're a current user of Starlink internet service, you're experiencing a broadband connection with higher maximum download and upload speeds than Viasat (350Mbps/25Mbps compared with 150Mbps/3Mbps). Starlink also has lower latency than Viasat (25 to 60ms versus 450 to 700ms), making gaming and other online activities that require fast response times much more feasible on Starlink than Viasat. Latency is expected to be lower in the near future as the company aims to reduce latency to a stable 20ms.Starlink also removed its waitlist throughout the country, as shown in its coverage map. Potential customers can now access their products without waiting several months to receive their orders. Pricing will depend on your chosen plan and address, but Viasat is cheaper than Starlink. Viasat customers can expect to pay anywhere between $100 to $150 monthly versus $140 to $1,500 (Priority) and $150 to $5,000 (Mobile) at Starlink. Suppose you're in a rural or underserved area with few options for internet connectivity. In that case, Viasat can get you connected and may be a cheaper alternative, whereas Starlink could be an option down the road.

Do all satellite internet providers have data caps?
Technically, Hughesnet and Viasat do not. Each claims to offer "unlimited data" because neither charges overage fees, but each has a set data limit for its plans. If you hit that data limit before your monthly billing cycle ends, there won't be monetary penalties, but you will experience much slower, throttled speeds for the remainder of that month. Your data may not be capped, but I would call that practice a limitation. Starlink offers truly unlimited data to its standard users. That significant advantage over its competitors changed for some customers in April 2023 when Starlink introduced its own data cap for priority users. The limit is a sizable 2 terabytes of data per month (well above the data limits of Hughesnet and Viasat), but it's still a significant change from unlimited data. You can access more data if you upgrade to the Mobile Priority plan, but that's going to cost you anywhere between $250 and $5,000 a month.

Is Starlink faster than Hughesnet?
Yes. Starlink customers can expect download speeds from 100Mbps to 350Mbps. CNET's John Kim tested the service and experienced average download speeds of around 78Mbps; Ookla clocked its median download speed in early 2023 at 65Mbps. (Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis)Hughesnet, which relies on satellites in a much higher orbit than Starlink uses -- which means data takes a little longer to travel back and forth -- offers plans with maximum download speeds of 100Mbps. That's not as fast as Viasat's unleashed plan with speeds of up to 150Mbps, but both are no match for Starlink.

Are Telesat or OneWeb worth considering?
Although both are satellite internet service providers, Telesat is a Canadian-owned company, and OneWeb is made for those in the UK. Telesat and OneWeb aren't options for US residents.

What is the best satellite internet for streaming?
Since streaming videos requires more bandwidth, the best satellite internet for streaming must have a high enough download speed to support the action. We recommend Starlink for streaming since the maximum download speeds are higher than Hughesnet and Viasat’s.

What is the best satellite internet for gaming?
With gaming, you'll want a provider with lower latency. That means a shorter delay in your data getting to the game's server and back -- less lag. Hughesnet and Viasat admit their services are not great for gaming, but Starlink boasts of lower lag (due to the lower orbit of its satellites) and says gamers can successfully use its service. CNET's own John Kim tried gaming using Starlink's service and was pleasantly surprised.

Is satellite internet affected by weather?
Regular weather, like sunny, cloudy or rainy skies, shouldn’t impact your internet. Heavy thunderstorms or snow may cause interference with your signal and cause slower speeds or a temporary loss of connection. Even if the weather is fine at your location, it might not be where the satellite is located. Your internet service should return to normal as soon as the weather passes. To learn more, read our guide on how to weather-proof your internet.
