What is the best internet provider in Chicago?CNET’s top recommendation for most households in Chicago is AT&T Fiber due to its ultra-fast symmetrical speeds, straightforward pricing and solid availability. If AT&T Fiber isn’t available in your neighborhood, Xfinity, Verizon 5G Home Internet and Rise Broadband are reliable alternatives.The best internet provider for your home depends on your budget and speed needs. To help you decide, our broadband experts reviewed the top options and found the fastest speeds and best deals in Chicago. If you’re looking for affordable service, Astound Broadband has plans at $30 per month for 300Mbps speeds and beyond. For those who need top-tier performance, AT&T Fiber also delivers the fastest internet in the area with speeds up to 5,000Mbps for $245 per month, all without data caps or long-term contracts.Best internet in Chicago, IllinoisChicago internet providers compared

Source: CNET analysis of provider data.Other available internet providers in ChicagoAir Wans: Air Wans is a folksy fixed wireless provider servicing the rural areas of Illinois and Indiana surrounding Chicago. Pricing ranges from $50 to $100 a month with no contracts, data caps, throttling or price increases after the first year. The rub is that Air Wans speeds are some of the slowest you'll find, ranging from just 75 to 300Mbps with the downloads and uploads aggregated together.Astound Broadband: Astound boasts strong pricing during the first two years of service. Monthly rates on all four of the plans offered to Chicagoans will increase by $20 after the introductory period, and you can expect to pay additional fees on top of that, including an arbitrary monthly network access fee of up to $17 that isn't included in your base rate.

Satellite internet: A satellite internet connection uses a receiver dish mounted outside your home to connect with satellites orbiting overhead to get you online. You'll find service available from Hughesnet, Viasat and perhaps Starlink. In most cases, the prices are too high, the speeds are too slow, and the data caps are too restrictive compared with other Chicago internet options. It's only worth considering if you lack other alternatives, and for most of Chicago, that won't be the case.T-Mobile Home Internet: Like Verizon, T-Mobile now offers cellular home internet service in hundreds of cities nationwide, including Chicago. You'll simply plug in a cellular modem that gets its signals not from wires in the wall, but over the 5G and LTE airwaves, like your phone. T-Mobile offers three plans ranging between $50 and $70 a month, and speeds will range from 87 to 415Mbps in most homes with a strong enough signal to sign up. There are no data caps or contracts to worry about, and your price won't arbitrarily rise after 12 months, either.Cheap internet options in ChicagoYou'll need to pay about $50 per month if you're looking for the most affordable internet plan at your Chicago address. Air Wans, Verizon, T-Mobile and Astound Broadband all have starting plans priced at $50. And if you're a Verizon or T-Mobile mobile customer, then you may be able to bundle your internet and bring the price down to just $35 per month.What's the cheapest internet plan in Chicago?

Source: CNET analysis of provider data.How to find internet deals and promotions in ChicagoThe best internet deals and top promotions in Chicago depend on what discounts are available during a given time. Most deals are short-lived, but we look frequently for the latest offers. Chicago internet providers, such as Xfinity and Rise Broadband, may offer lower introductory pricing or streaming add-ons for a limited time. Many, including AT&T and Verizon, run the same standard pricing year-round. For a more extensive list of promos, check out our guide on the best internet deals.
Joe Daniel Price/Getty ImagesHow fast is Chicago broadband?Ookla speed test data put the Windy City in the bottom six among the nation's top 100 most populous cities (at an inglorious 95th position). It chalks up a median download speed of approximately 135Mbps, over 100Mbps behind a top-twenty city like North Las Vegas. Chicagoans still have plenty of ways to get high-speed internet in their homes. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)Your fastest option for getting online in Chicago is to go with a fiber provider, but the service isn't available everywhere. AT&T is your best bet, with its fastest plan for Chicago ringing in with download and upload speeds of 5,000Mbps at a hefty flat monthly rate of $245. Fastest internet plans in Chicago

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address.For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need.0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics: browsing the internet, sending and receiving email and streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one person sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two people to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities, like videoconferencing, streaming and gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more people to engage in high-bandwidth activities all at the same time.How CNET chose the best internet providers in ChicagoInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. What’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information, drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from FCC.gov.It doesn’t end there: We use the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP’s service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?Do customers get decent value for what they’re paying?Are customers happy with their service?The answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers that come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and also consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.To explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.What's the final word on internet providers in Chicago?The Windy City has a lot of options when it comes to home internet, including both speedy and more affordable service. If you can get your hands on fiber connectivity, like AT&T Fiber, that will be your best choice. Cable companies like Xfinity and Astound Broadband have wider coverage for Chicagoans, so you might have to go with those providers instead.Internet providers in Chicago FAQs
How much is internet per month in Chicago?
Prices will vary depending on your provider and selected plan, but most entry-level internet plans in Chicago start at $50 a month. Faster plans will cost more, with gigabit service from AT&T costing $80 to $245 a month in Chicago. Some providers enforce a price increase after your first year -- Xfinity's fastest Chicago plan nets you download speeds of 2,000Mbps and costs $85 a month for the first five years, then $95 a month after that.
Show more
Can I get fiber internet in Chicago?
It depends on your address. AT&T offers fiber service in Chicago, but its footprint currently covers "hundreds of thousands" of residents in a city of 2.71 million. That means the odds are somewhat low that you'll find it available at your address. Smaller regional providers like Zentro Internet also offer fiber service at select addresses, but only to a scattering of buildings throughout the city.
Show more
Does Chicago have Google Fiber?
Chicago isn't a Google Fiber city, so you won't find fiber internet plans from Google in the area. The company offers its Google Fiber Webpass service in Chicago: It's a high-speed fixed wireless internet service available only in select buildings equipped with antennas capable of receiving the signal. Gigabit speeds are possible at some locations with Webpass, and the service costs $70 or $63 a month with a one-year contract. You can find serviceable addresses listed on the Google Webpass site.

What are the disadvantages of cable internet?
Although cable internet can offer fast, gigabit-level download speeds over the same wiring traditionally used to deliver television signals, it offers upload speeds that are much slower and typically limited to the double digits, at best. That can limit device performance whenever you send lots of data to the web (video calls and large uploads might be slower than you'd like). Cable is also slightly more susceptible to network slowdowns during peak usage than fiber connections.
