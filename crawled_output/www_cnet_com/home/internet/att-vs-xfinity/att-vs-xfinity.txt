Lots of plan options, solid customer satisfaction numbers, data caps on some plans
Sarah Tew/CNETIs AT&T or Xfinity internet better?AT&T and Xfinity are two of the biggest internet service providers (ISP) in the country. But which ISP is a better fit for your home? AT&T Fiber has faster download and upload speeds, better service terms and higher customer satisfaction ratings than Xfinity, but it also has slightly higher pricing for comparable speeds. Additionally, fiber internet from AT&T isn't available everywhere. Xfinity is the better option when it comes to availability, cheap internet and discounted bundle packages, at least until the introductory pricing period ends and standard pricing goes into effect. Price increases are pretty standard when it comes to cable ISPs. However, customers can opt for Xfinity's new five-year price guarantee in exchange for a higher monthly rate. Even at that higher monthly bill, you can save money since the five-year price guarantee comes with free equipment and unlimited data. With a combined 69% nationwide coverage, according to the FCC, and overlap in significant portions of each other's networks, the odds of you having to choose internet service between AT&T and Xfinity are fairly high.It's safe to say that whichever option you choose, both providers are among the best ISPs nationwide, so you really can't go too wrong. In the most recent surveys from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power Survey, AT&T and Xfinity finished with above-average ratings among major internet providers. Locating local internet providers
Which ISP better suits your home networking needs: AT&T or Xfinity? Let's examine how they compare.
AT&T
A frontrunner among fiber internet providers Our take - AT&T Fiber plans are tough to beat, offering top-notch high-speed internet. Five-speed tiers are available: 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 megabits per second, and prices range from $55 to $245 per month. Starting prices are a bit higher than Xfinity's, but there are no set price increases, no contracts and no equipment fees to add to your bill.

Xfinity
A top choice for cable internet Our take - With Xfinity, you can expect more plan options and a cheaper starting plan than AT&T. However, watch out for a price increase after your promotional period. It could add as much as $20 to $50 to your bill, depending on your chosen plan. If you don't want to deal with price hikes after a year, you can opt for Xfinity's five-year price lock. It also includes free equipment, unlimited data and and no contracts.

Source: CNET analysis of provider data.As mentioned earlier, Xfinity recently began offering new customers a five-year price lock for its cable plans. If you sign up for the five-year price guarantee, your monthly bill will be higher by $10 to $15, but you won't face an increase until 60 months down the road. For the standard one-year price lock, rates on all plans, excluding the $300-per-month 10 gigabit plan, are set to increase after one year. Meanwhile, AT&T Fiber plans, speeds, and terms are simpler and more straightforward regardless of where in the country you live. The provider's 300, 500, and 1,000Mbps plans are available in all service areas, and many will also have the choice of 2,000 and 5,000Mbps plans. There is no set price increase after 12 months and regardless of your service term, AT&T offers free equipment for all plans. Fees, data caps and other potential sticking points AT&T is much clearer about service terms and doesn't offer any hidden fees -- but again, only for its fiber plans. Let's take a closer look. AT&T vs. Xfinity added feesLike most providers, AT&T and Xfinity will charge you a bit extra each month if you don't enroll in autopay or paperless billing, but those fees are easy enough to dodge if you just select autopay when you sign up. The equipment fees are another story. With AT&T, you won't need to pay extra to use AT&T's Wi-Fi gateway. That's included in the regular monthly fee. With Comcast Xfinity, the equipment fee is currently included in the monthly cost, but only for your initial promotional rate. The cost to rent the xFi Gateway is typically $15 to $25 per month (or $20 per month for the fiber 10Gbps plan), but it is unclear if that will return after your promotional rate or if it will continue to be included in your monthly bill.
You'll need to add $14 per month to your Comcast bill to use its xFi Gateway -- but you can skip that fee by using your own modem and router.  ComcastAT&T vs. Xfinity data capsAs for data caps, AT&T doesn't enforce them with any of its fiber plans or its new 5G home internet service, AT&T Internet Air. AT&T's basic fixed wireless plan does enforce a data cap, however, kicking in at 350GB. You'll still get charged $10 for each additional 50GB of data you use, but AT&T caps the charge at $200 instead of $100. Be mindful of falling asleep during a Netflix binge, AT&T Fixed Wireless customers.Xfinity, meanwhile, had a monthly data cap of 1.25TB for certain plans, but currently all tiers include unlimited data. Similar to the equipment fee, it's unclear if the unlimited data will continue after the promotional period. If the cap does return, going over may cost you $10 for every 50GB of excess data used, capped at $100.
AT&T vs. Xfinity contractsAT&T internet service, from fiber to fixed wireless, does not require a contract. Select markets for Xfinity used to require customers to sign a one to two-year agreement for some plans. But currently, no Xfinity plans require an annual contract. That's a win for each side. AT&T vs. Xfinity installation costsAT&T charges $99 for professional, in-home installation, but self-installation kits are available for some addresses and AT&T typically waives the cost for installation for new customers.With Xfinity, professional installation typically costs $100, but you don't have to "qualify" for the self-installation option like you do with AT&T. However, the self-installation option will incur a one-time charge of $40. AT&T vs. Xfinity coverage compared
AT&T's networks (copper in pink, fiber in purple) and Xfinity's cable internet service (green) share coverage areas in the South, Midwest and parts of California. FCC/MapboxA product of the nation's largest cable provider, Xfinity Internet, is available in select regions across 39 states and Washington, DC, covering about one-third of the entire population of the US. Most of that coverage is cable internet, but Xfinity has a small fiber network.Areas where Xfinity's fiber internet service is available primarily include parts Indiana, Illinois and Michigan, though parts of Florida, Georgia and Tennessee may be serviceable for fiber as well.As for AT&T, the telecom company offers home internet plans in 22 states, covering much of the South, Midwest and West Coast. Both providers may be available at your address in some parts of the country, including Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Memphis, Miami and San Francisco.AT&T pegs the number of households with access to fiber at approximately 21 million, spanning over 100 metro areas. The company plans to expand fiber access to millions more homes by the end of 2025, including the rollout of its multigigabit plans.For the rest, there's AT&T Internet Air and AT&T Fixed Wireless, which use a portable modem or satellite mounted at your home to receive a wireless signal, and AT&T Internet, which uses DSL copper cable connections in combination with the company's fiber infrastructure to deliver service to people's homes, albeit it at much slower speeds. AT&T and Xfinity perks and promos AT&T typically has limited-time offers for new fiber customers. Currently, AT&T Fiber customers can receive a VISA gift if they sign up online. You may receive a reward of $50, $100 or $150, depending on your chosen tier. AT&T also recently introduced it's All-Fi Pro package, which features additional perks like the Wi-Fi 7 gateway router. Additionally, wherever you are in the country, you'll have access to AT&T's nationwide network of 30,000 hotspots. Xfinity is no slouch, either. Besides the five-year price lock offer for new customers, there are also a number of enticing promos upon signing for service. For those who are eligible for an Xfinity mobile line, you can shave off $10 to $30 a month from your internet bill for the first two years. Similar to many cable ISPs, Xfinity also gives you several options to bundle your internet with TV package or a mobile line, saving you $10 or more per month. Even better, Xfinity introduced StreamSaver last year, a new streaming service bundle combining Netflix, Peacock and Apple TV Plus for just $15 monthly. If you sign up for the gigabit and faster plans, Peacock Premium is already included with your service. Like AT&T, Xfinity has over 20 million hotspots nationwide, allowing you to stay connected to the internet wherever you are. AT&T vs. Xfinity customer satisfaction scores
ACSIEveryone loves to hate their internet provider, so it's no surprise that customer satisfaction scores for the ISP industry aren't anything impressive. Still, AT&T and Xfinity are relatively strong performers here. AT&T remained at the top year-over-year with an 80 out of 100 from the latest American Customer Satisfaction Index. Xfinity's non-fiber score dropped a bit from 68 to 67 (bringing it just below the industry average of 68), but its fiber rating improved from 73 to 75. Not great, but not bad, either.Meanwhile, AT&T grabbed the top spot in the North-Central and West regions (while Xfinity scored second-highest in both) in the most recent J.D. Power US Residential Internet Service Provider Satisfaction Study for 2024. Notably, Xfinity just narrowly beat AT&T in the South with a score of 565 to AT&T's 564. AT&T vs. Xfinity recapIf your options are AT&T's fixed wireless service and Xfinity, the latter will be the best choice for speed, value, and reliability nearly every time. On the other hand, if your address is serviceable for AT&T Fiber and Xfinity, you're likely to get a better value with more favorable service terms from AT&T Fiber than Xfinity. Given the choice of the two, Xfinity stands out for its broad availability and low introductory pricing, but AT&T Fiber has the advantage in virtually every other category.AT&T vs. Xfinity FAQs
Which is better: AT&T or Xfinity?
It depends on whether you can get AT&T Fiber at your address. Xfinity has the fastest plan between the two (the Gigabit Pro plan at 10,000Mbps), but at $300 per month, it's also the most expensive. AT&T has a 5,000Mbps plan that's a bit cheaper at $245 a month. We might lean toward AT&T because of its fiber internet plans, but those aren't available to all customers within its footprint. Others might have to settle for its slower, fixed wireless plans. In those cases, Xfinity and its cable internet plans would be preferable.
Show more
Is Xfinity cheaper than AT&T?
Among its regular offerings, Xfinity's cheapest plan is $40 per month in the first year. The cost will be higher if you sign up for its five-year price lock. AT&T Fiber's cheapest tier starts at $55 monthly. However, both providers also offer discounted plans for low-income households. Access from AT&T has a 100Mbps plan for $30 per month, while Xfinity has Internet Essentials and Internet Essentials Plus, offering 75Mbps for $15 a month and 100Mbps for $30, respectively.
Show more
Can you get fiber internet service from AT&T or Xfinity?
Yes. AT&T's fiber internet offerings are more widely available. According to the FCC's latest information, AT&T provides fiber internet to about a third of its customers. Meanwhile, Xfinity is mostly a hybrid of cable and fiber, though its Gigabit Pro tier is a 100% fiber connection.
