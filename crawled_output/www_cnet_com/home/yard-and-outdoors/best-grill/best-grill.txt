Factors to consider when choosing the best grill
Other grills we tested
Having tested more than 35 grills, from speedy weeknight gas grills to low-and-slow pellet smokers, we've learned what really matters when shopping for a new backyard cooker. It comes down to four key factors: fuel type, cooking style, cooking capacity, and price.Whether you're after a pellet, charcoal, portable or gas grill, the perfect one is out there waiting for you, and we've zeroed in on the best in every category to fit your summer plans (and patio). Here's everything we've learned to help you find your perfect grill match.What's the best overall grill of 2025
David Watsky/CNETWe've crowned the reliable Weber E-310 three-burner propane grill as the best grill overall. It's a midsize, midpriced grill that impressed us with even cooking, simple assembly, a sturdy build and Weber's reputation for putting together long-lasting outdoor grills. The Spirit is available in two- and four-burner models, but we love the three-burner size for most households. Got more mouths to feed or need your grilling on the go? Don't worry -- we have picks for the best large grill, best camping grill and many more in our list of the best grills to buy in 2025, all tested by CNET. Best grills

Best grill overall
Weber Spirit E-310
Pros
Solid and sturdy build, yet easy to wheel around the deck
Quick ignition system worked without fail
Had even heat dispersion
Weber grills hold up, making this a solid value purchase
Cons
No extras included with grill
Why we like it: There's a reason the Weber Spirit is one of the best-selling gas grills. The thoughtfully designed Weber has three burners and enough grill space (450 total square inches including top rack) to accommodate most grilling sessions. The E-310 holds about nine average-size burgers, so you may need to cook in batches when feeding larger groups. The sturdy Spirit aced all our cooking tests, grilling ribs and chicken evenly and searing a crust on burgers quickly so we could maintain a juicy medium-rare inside. The Spirit's snap ignition worked better than other systems and lit the grill's three burners without fail. In our experience using Weber grills, the ignition systems also hold up over time, while other brands often give out.Who is it for:This is our top pick for most people. The Weber Spirit cooks evenly and consistently and burns hot, allowing you to sear steaks, burgers, veggies and fish. Webers also tend to last better, making this grill an exceptional value when compared with others in the same price range.Who should avoid it: The Spirit E-310 isn't teeming with extras, so folks seeking bells and whistles on their gas grill might consider another model on our list. It also has a medium-capacity grill top, so people feeding big crowds on the regular will benefit from a larger model. If it's more space you seek, the four-burner Spirit is available for $180 more. The more modest two-burner version can be had for $399.  ... Show more

Best large grill for families
Monument Eminence 605
Pros
Huge cooking area with 860 square inches of space
Rotisserie adds a whole new dimension to grilling
The gas can weight helps you know when you need to refill.
Cons
A 4-hour construction time means you really need to love your grill
It costs more than $1,300
Why we like it: We've been recommending
Monument grills for years now and every time we test a new model, we discover upgrades that cement its status as a CNET pick. The latest, the Eminence 605, is a six-burner behemoth designed to grill food in any way you can imagine. It has modern conveniences, like an app to monitor the built-in temperature probes, and a searing station on the side that you can use to brown off corn and vegetables. It even comes with a gas can weigh scale that helps determine when your gas is low. Who is it for:The Eminence 605 is a griller's grill. Its six-burner, 860 square-inch cooking area is perfect for larger families and those who cook for many people. The rotisserie spit has a dedicated back burner for a more even cook. I've used it for chicken, beef and even a large shish kebab and it perfectly cooked them all. Because of the high heat burners, the grill heats incredibly fast, taking just 7 minutes to reach 425 degrees so you can cook almost immediately. If you're looking to grill a diverse selection of foods for many people, then the Eminence 605 is perfect for you.Who shouldn't buy it:Building the Eminence was a labor of love. It took two of us three hours to assemble it -- longest it's ever taken to build a grill. The box is filled with tiny pieces that need to be assembled, a lot of which feel like they could have been assembled earlier in the process. This is not a grill for the casual user or someone cooking for two or three.

Expert Grill
Best budget charcoal grill
Expert Grill Heavy Duty 24-Inch Charcoal Grill
Pros
Excellent build quality for a budget grill
582 square inches of cook space is big enough for a large family
The built-in hooks, bottle opener and easy to clean spaces make it a great choice
Cons
The ash tray is thin and will warp over time if not well maintained
Why we like it:When our tester James Bricknell moved out to California’s High Desert, he had two priorities: a grill big enough to feed a crowd and a price tag that wouldn’t break the bank after an expensive move. He landed on a budget-friendly model that impressed right out of the box — sturdy materials, solid build and the kind of weight that promised durability. And it delivered.The removable ashtray made cleanup painless, and the built-in thermometer was a game changer for low-and-slow smoking without constantly lifting the lid. Bonus points for thoughtful extras like a built-in bottle opener and utensil hooks under the side shelf.Who is it for:If you want the taste that only charcoal can give you but have a limited budget, the Expert grill is excellent. The large cooking area means you can cook a big family meal with no issue, and I really like the little touches like the adjustable cooking rack. As the coals burn down, they radiate less heat. Being able to move the grates down to be closer to the coals lets you use them for longer and gives you greater control of your cooking times.Who shouldn't get it:Charcoal grills are not for everybody. Several states don't allow charcoal for fear of forest fires and it takes longer to get a charcoal grill going. If you want an instant grilling hit then gas is the way to go. You'll also need to clean a charcoal grill more often than a gas one as the coal dust can corrode the metal over time.  ... Show more

Traeger's Ironwood XL offers an easy and consistent way to cook nearly anything. Its range of features ensures that all of your food tastes delicious. Chris Wedel/CNET
Best pellet grill
Traeger Ironwood XL
Pros
A tight lid seal makes the smoking experience much more efficient
The light on the lid and pellet hopper make evening cooking much easier
The mobile app and WiFire feature lets you keep an eye on your meat without lifting the lid.
Cons
Traeger grills are expensive. There's just no getting around it.
Why we like it:Seeing Traeger at the top of this list shouldn't be surprising, considering the brand truly popularized the pellet grill. While there are many choices in the Traeger lineup to choose from, after testing the latest Ironwood XL, it was clear that this is the one that can do it all. There is a smaller version, the Traeger Ironwood, which has all the same features as the XL model but more than 300 square inches less cooking space. If you don't plan on cooking large pieces of meat like brisket or for large groups of people, then the smaller model might be for you. The WiFIRE features allow you to monitor grill temps, pellet levels, food temps with the included meat probes and more. The control system combining a rotating knob and touchscreen makes tuning the grill to your needs a snap. We also like the Traeger app, which has many recipes to send straight to your grill. The biggest downside is the price, which is quite expensive. Who is it for: The Traeger Ironwood XL gets the top spot for smokers because of more than just the large cooking area. It's because it offers the complete package for pellet grills. It does a great job of managing its pellet use. When we cooked for 24 hours on it, with meals ranging from pork chops to beer can chicken to pork butt to brisket, the Ironwood XL handled it all wonderfully. With a 165- to 500-degree temperature range, it can cook any way you want. If you're looking for something versatile that can cook burgers, veggies and entire smoked briskets, then the Ironwood is an excellent choice. There is little this grill can't do when cooking outdoors.Who shouldn't buy it:There is no getting around it: any Traeger grill is expensive. They are built to last, and you can see the craftsmanship that went into the design but they aren't for those on a slim budget. Only think about picking this up if you have the thousands of dollars needed to make the purchase.  ... Show more

The new Ninja FlexFlame has all the makings for a delicious summer. David Watsky/CNET
Best gas grill features
Ninja FlexFlame
Pros
A built-in smoker gives ribs, chicken and brisket an authentic barbecue flavor
Convection fan disperses heat evenly throughout the chamber
Griddle attachment let us cook fish and veggies on one side without losing them through the grates
Plenty of space to grill on the 545 square inches of cooking surface
Cons
Expensive and most attachments are extra
Must be plugged in to operate
Why we like it:Ninja's first full-size grill, the FlexFlame, is unlike any other gas grill we've tested. The large propane-powered unit has a built-in smoker box that can be turned on with the push of a button and that saturated the food inside with applewood or hickory flavor. The FlexFlame has loads of attachments, mostly sold separately, that turn it into a flat-top griddle or a pizza oven. The Ninja exhibited exceptional temperature control, all the way up to a scorching 600 degrees Fahrenheit, and lightning-fast heat recovery when the lid was closed after flipping burgers or checking chicken.We loved making seared steaks over the grates on one side and using the half-griddle attachment to cook flaky fish and veggies on the other. The FlexFlame offers more versatility than most grills and is easy to operate. Read our full review of the Ninja FlexFlame here.Who is it for:This is a big, feature-heavy grill that makes it a joy to entertain large groups. The main grill surface offers 424 square inches of cooking capacity (enough for about 15 burgers), and a stop rack supplements that with another 121 square inches. You can cook using multiple modes and methods at once, including flat-top griddling, smoking, and using a dedicated pizza stone for slinging pies. The grill's exceptional heat control, thanks to a convection fan and carefully calibrated dials, make it a pleasure to roast chicken or slow-cook a brisket. Heat is dispersed so evenly throughout the chamber, you could actually use it for baking. The built-in smoker box lets wannabe pitmasters impart authentic barbecue flavor. Who should avoid it:The FlexFlame has a bunch of features that contribute to the higher cost. If you don't think you'll use the smoker function or griddle attachment, it might not be worth the expense. This grill also requires electricity to run, which can be cumbersome depending on your outdoor configuration.  ... Show more

Pellet grills are great for being accessible and taking much of the guess work out of making incredible food. Chris Wedel/CNET
Best large pellet grill
Recteq Flagship XL 1400
Pros
The largest cooking area & pellet hopper you've ever seen
Mobile app to control heat and monitor cooking
Cons
We wish it had a seal around the lid like the Traeger does
Why we like it:The Recteq brand may be a bit under the radar compared to others like Traeger, but the Flagship XL 1400 does some things the Ironwood XL cannot. With a massive 1,437 square-inch cooking surface, you can cook a whole lot of food. Like, 75 hamburgers at one time. Enough to feed the entire block.With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, using the Recteq app makes it easy to monitor the grill temp and meat temps with the included probes. You can't check the pellet level from the app like with the Ironwood XL.Because the Recteq Flagship XL 1400 is built like a tank, including the heavy bullhorn handles, it does an excellent job at maintaining an even temp across the grill. This is largely thanks to the heavy cast iron burn pot deflector and the large stainless steel smoke and heat deflector.Who is it for: The Flagship XL is for people who are serious about cooking for everybody. People with massive families or small businesses could use the XL to smoke and grill for dozens of people easily. To complement the large cooking area, the Flagship XL 1400 also boasts a massive pellet hopper, easily handling more than 40 pounds of wood pellets. It also did a good job of cooking efficiently during the overnight brisket smoking during testing. So if you are looking for long, slow cooks this could be for you.Who shouldn't buy it:Almost everyone who grills or smokes casually should avoid the Flagship XL. It's just too big for the average person to use comfortably and if you're only smoking a rack of ribs or enough wings for four getting it up to temperature will use too much fuel for it to be worthwhile.  ...

Best electric grill
Ninja Woodfire electric grill
Pros
Perfect size for two to four people to smoke a single meal
Uses just 1 cup of pellets per meal
Multiple functions like air frying and grilling make it a versatile smoker
Cons
The side pellet holder can become clogged if you don't maintain it well.
Why we like it:The Ninja Woodfire has all the convenience of an indoor electric grill and air fryer, with the addition of a small smoking hopper that lets you burn pellets. These pellets add a distinctive smoky taste to anything you are cooking without the need for an entire smoker. We've cooked chicken, salmon and beef on the grill setting using just a cup of pellets, saving much time and money compared with a full-size smoker. It even works with the air fryer so it is easy to make crispy wings with an Applewood smoke taste. Who is it for: The Woodfire is perfect for those who love the taste of smoked meat but don't have the time or space for a giant pellet smoker. It's big enough to cook a decent-sized turkey or several large cuts of meat, and the pellet used is tiny compared to a full-size smoker. If you want a quick smoke fix for a few friends, the Ninja Woodfire is perfect.Who shouldn't buy it:Anyone looking to smoke large cuts of meat like brisket or pork shoulder over a long period of time should look for something larger than the Woodfire. It's designed for single meals, not large parties or giant cuts of meat. The pellet hopper only holds one cup of pellets. That's not enough to smoke a haunch of beef.  ... Show more

Best flattop griddle
Traeger Flatrock
Pros
You can cook flaky fish and thin vegetables without losing them through the grates
Griddles require less cleaning after use
Great for making classic diner breakfast food
Cons
Food doesn't get char marks or flame-kissed
It's expensive at $900
Griddles require maintenance to keep the surface from rusting
Why we like it:Like all Traeger products, Flatrock's quality and usefulness can't be overstated. Some foods, including tacos and smash burgers, just can't be cooked on a standard grill, but a flat-top griddle makes them a breeze. (By the way, if you've never had a smash burger, you need one in your life. They're amazing.) We recommend the Flatrock, even though it's pricier than a Blackstone, because of the build quality and the placement of the griddle top. The top is sunk into the grill, meaning the heat stays in for longer, and the seal around the lid keeps it from getting as rusty in the off-season.The Flatrock uses Traeger's Pop and Lock system for accessories, so if you already have one of the brand's smokers, you can mix and match what you need. You will need to cure the Flatrock's surface, but we enjoyed creating just the right surface for our needs.Who is it for: Griddles are a grill genre that's pretty unique. The Flatrock is great for anyone who loves making tacos, breakfast burritos, Japanese teppanyaki or smash burgers. The heavy grill top requires some maintenance to keep it looking good but the flavor from a properly cured griddle top is hard to beat.Who shouldn't get it:If this is your first foray into cooking on a griddle, the Traeger may be too expensive to start. Its price is the biggest barrier to entry, so you could always start with one of the smaller Blackstones to see how you like it. Griddles also require regular maintenance to keep the surface from rusting.  ... Show more

Best grill for camping
Halo Griddle
Pros
Easy to carry out to a campsite or for tailgating
Even heat across the cooking surface, even out in the bush
Includes a spirit level to keep your oil from spilling while on an uneven surface
Cons
This really should have a cover as standard if you're expected to travel with it.
Why we like it:Halo has made some excellent products in the past few years, including a pizza oven that we tested and liked, but this griddle is a stand-out product. On top of all the standard testing we do with grills, CNET's James Bricknell got to take it for the first camping trip of the season and it was a smashing success. The cooking surface heated evenly, with two distinct burning zones and because of the inspired idea to include a spirit level and adjustable feet, he could set it up on a rickety picnic table and not have eggs run to one corner. That spirit level is such a good idea.We love having a giant griddle to cook for large groups
at home but the Halo tabletop griddle is perfect for making a few smash burgers or breakfast burritos without using a ton of gas. In fact, the Halo can use the large propane tanks or the smaller green ones just as easily.Who is it for:Anyone who wants to take their grilling on the road would do well with the Halo griddle. Camping is an obvious use but you could easily take it to a friend's house to help supplement the grill capacity or for tailgating at a cookout. It's heavy -- it's a thick grill pan, after all -- but not so heavy that you couldn't get it to just about any campsite.Who shouldn't get it:The Halo is really designed to be moved around and used in a portable environment. If you aren't planning to move it around, there are better choices. That said, it's good for getting out from the shed for the occasional grilling session.

Best kamado grill
Kamado Joe Konnected Joe
Pros
Premium look and feel, which it should have for the price
Remote monitoring with the app gives you peace of mind even when smoking
Can produce very high heat, making cooking a variety of meats a breeze.
Maintains consistent temperature for 12+ hours on one load of charcoal
Cons
That price tag is as high as the temperature
Heavy at 250 lbs - difficult to move
Why we Like it:Kamado grilling cookers are distinctively egg-shaped wood-burning grills. They impart a delicious smoky flavor to everything and this is the best grill in the bunch. They can run low and slow for hours at smoker temperatures and sear at high heat levels that go well beyond the capabilities of gas grills. That's hot enough to create true steakhouse steaks and real wood-fired pizza like a pro griller.These abilities are attributed to the thick ceramic used to form and line the grill, which is similar to what is used for a pizza stone in the top pizza ovens. That ceramic does an amazing job at holding heat, allowing you to use far less charcoal than you would in a traditional charcoal grill and get more smoke and heat from it. On our slow-and-low barbecue grill test, we adjusted grills to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius) and let go of the controls to see what happens. In this trial, the Konnected Joe demonstrated excellent temperature stability. Thanks to the Wi-Fi connectivity, you can monitor and set temps for your ceramic cooker from the comfort of your AC.Who is it for:Kamado grills are niche and designed for the griller's griller. Their smaller size makes them difficult to use for big parties but the charcoal flavor that you get from the high-heat environment is hard to beat. If you're a grill aficionado, then the Konnected Joe might be right for you.Who shouldn't buy it:Kamado grills are something a niche grill. They deliver results and have a passionate fanbase but you'll need to learn a new way to cook if you want to use them right. This isn't going to be for the family griller who just wants to cook some burgers and hot dogs. There are better grills for that.  ... Show more

How we test grills at CNET
We use thermocouples linked to computer software to measure internal grill temperatures. Brian Bennett/CNETWe test the main types of grills differently, but for most, we include a high-heat test like searing steak or grilling burgers, a medium, indirect heat test like grilling a whole chicken for more than an hour and a low-and-slow test with racks of ribs. With over 30 grills tested, we've got this down to a tee. To determine what should be the best outdoor barbecue grill, we collect data including total cooking time, temperatures inside the grill and temperatures inside separate pieces of meat. All that information helps us find where grills might have hot spots or thermometer inconsistencies.High heat test: Cooking 5.3-ounce burger patties until they reach 145 degree internal temperature.Indirect heat test: Cooking a 5.5-pound chicken off the flames to 160 degrees.Low and Slow: Cooking a rack of pork ribs at 225 for 3 hours and taste testing.Temperature consistency
James Bricknell/CNETWe use the InfiRay P2 Pro to test how fast the grills heat up and if the heat is even. It only works as the grills heat up because the top temperature is too high, but it gives us a good idea of how well each grill spreads the needed heat. The InfiRay P@ allows us to take temperature readings at multiple points across the heating area for a better average result. We also use it to see if there is any major heat loss from other areas on the grill that may show poor quality builds.We also use a stopwatch to determine how quickly the temperature drops over a one-minute interval when opening the lid. It's an especially helpful test for smokers, where you may need to check the meat but don't want to compromise the cooking time. We always suggest using a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of any food you are smoking, rather than opening the lid as they almost all lose around 100 degrees per minute.Taste testing
Delicious food is delicious James Bricknell / CNETThere's also a fair amount of (read: so much) taste testing, lively debate, and voting among our editors and families, in addition to the data we gather about grilling temperatures and cooking times. You might think it would be more fun than work to eat delicious food while discussing the merits of a grill, and you'd be right.We don't just taste test the three specific products in our temperature tests, as that wouldn't give us a good spread. We choose products that people love to grill, including vegetables like corn, asparagus, and mushrooms, and meats like chicken legs, wings and steaks. When we can, we cook on multiple grills at once and keep a note on which products come from where. Then ask our (lucky) testers which they like the most. This is the least objective of the tests, but it is helpful in a real-world way. If the food just doesn't taste good, then that grill likely isn't doing a good job.
You can grill flaky fish or make a diner-style breakfast on the FlexFlame's griddle. David Watsky/CNETIf you're interested in any particular method of testing, we have a dedicated how we test page, plus our recommendations for cooking with kamado grills, portable grills and charcoal grills ready for your perusal. Happy grilling. Factors to consider when choosing the best grill
While the perfect grill may not exist for everyone, many grills tick a lot of boxes. The right grill for you depends on what type of food you want to grill, so bear that in mind. Here is some guidance:Type of grillCharcoal grill: Good for high heat and getting that perfect char.Gas grill: Great for large grills and spur-of-the-moment outdoor cooking.Flat top grills (griddles): Perfect for smash burgers and tacos.Pellet grill: Perfect for long, slow cooking and smoking your food.Kamado grill: Great for extreme heat or heat retention.Pizza oven: Wonderful for pizza, sure, but great for other breads, too.Budget rangeYour budget can often determine what kind of grill you have. If your budget is low or you are just starting out in the grilling game, then a charcoal grill is likely the cheapest way to start. The fuel is cheap, too, and easy to get just about anywhere. If you are looking for something you can use all year round, or is a little more versatile, then a gas grill is the way to go. Propane is fairly cheap and lasts longer than a bag of coal. It's cheaper in the long run. Smokers can also be found for cheap, though the best ones can skyrocket in price. Always start with a more affordable version before jumping into something pricey. After all, it might not be the right type of grilling for you.Additional features
Ninja's FlexFlame was one of the more feature-heavy grills we tested. David Watsky/CNETHaving extra features is always great. For grills, that means extras that make it easier to cook the food or make the food taste better. We like to have an enclosed lower area, for example, not because it makes the food taste good, but because it's easier to store all the equipment needed to grill. Having a grill with a built-in Bluetooth connection and app can also make grilling easier and make the food taste better, so it's a double whammy. Making everything smart isn't always helpful, but having a way to monitor your cooking is.One of the reasons the Eminence 605 from Monument is high on our list is because of the extras it offers at no additional cost. The side searing plate, the rotisserie and smart temperature probes make it a grilling machine for those who love this cooking style.No matter what type of outdoor grill you choose, you should brush up on how to clean it (keeping that grilling surface clean with a grill brush and grill cleaner is essential) and get the best accessories for grilling. Having the right techniques and tools of the trade will complement your perfect grill, turn you into a grill master extraordinaire and make your cookouts a breeze. Other grills we tested
Monument Denali 605: This was a former best overall pick, but we recently replaced it with Monument's newer model, the Eminence 605.Char-Broil Signature Series four-burner: We tested this well-built and practical Char-Broil model in 2019. It was middle of the road in our testing and the new model is available for around $550. It comes with plenty of cooking space, a side burner and cabinet doors. If you're a fan of Char-Broil's grills, this model is a safe bet, but there are better grills from other brands for your money.Napoleon Rogue three-burner: Despite its cool looks and sturdy construction, this Napoleon model was underwhelming in our tests. At $749, it's pricey and the Char-Broil three-burner we tested delivered better results.Dyna-glo five-burner: This reasonably priced five-burner has plenty of power, with 63,000 BTU -- plus a sixth "turbo" burner that offers an additional 12,000 BTU. We like its porcelain cast-iron grate cooking surface for searing. Still, we found the cooking to be uneven.Char-Broil Commercial three-burner:This grill with smart features was a previous pick on our list but it's been usurped as best under $500 model by the Weber Spirit E-310.KitchenAid 720-0891C (Update: Out of Stock): KitchenAid's style and color options are impressive, but the performance of this $299, two-burner gas grill was underwhelming in all three tests. If you're looking for a two-burner grill, the Weber Spirit II E-210 is a better choice. It's a Propane gas grill but can also be converted to natural gas. This model is also pretty tough to find in stock since it was recently discontinued.  Magma Firebox Single-Burner: This is another grill we liked but it's not portable, as advertised, nor affordable. The burner alone weighs 26 pounds and originally cost $200 (although it's currently on a steep clearance), but you'll need to add the grill top accessory, which costs $350. This model was engineered with boaters in mind, so if you're setting sail, you might give the pricey Magma a closer lookGiantex Tabletop Propane Grill: We had no major issues with this grill. It worked fine, got hot and cooked evenly. When compared to the Weber Q, we simply like the design of those small gas grills better. The Weber Q is more solid and has those handy built-in shelves while the NomadiQ is simply the most portable gas grill we've ever seen. This is a fine grill and worthy of the $300 list price.Char-Broil Deluxe Tabletop Grill: While the above Char-Broil might work as a no-nonsense budget grill, this model is way too poorly designed and crafted to waste $70. It is one of the worst for value in the small grill category and a definite one to avoid.Char-Broil Portable Gas Grill: This grill is cheap, and the product matches the price tag. It was rickety once assembled and didn't feel like it would last more than a season. For $50, what more could you hope for? If you need something to get you through a camping weekend or two, this should do the trick.
Grill FAQs
Should I get a natural gas or propane gas grill?
It may seem like this is a simple question to answer, but they aren't really the same thing. Some propane gas grills can be converted to run off of natural gas from your home gas line, but you lose the portability of a propane tank.Natural gas grills are normally installed in an outdoor kitchen where the gas line can be run permanently. If you don't have the room to build a permanent fixture, then sticking with propane is your best option.
How do different grill types compare in terms of weather resistance?
Firstly, you should always buy your grill a cover. A good cover will keep your grill protected from too much sun and too much rain, so invest in one as soon as you can.Build quality will affect weather resistance more than fuel type, but fuel does make a difference. Charcoal and pellet grills produce ash, which, when mixed with rainwater, can become extremely corrosive. A good maintenance schedule will keep a lot of corrosion at bay, but if you do live in a wet environment, then a gas grill may be a better option. The stainless steel construction is less likely to corrode over time and there is almost no ash to increase that corrosion.
