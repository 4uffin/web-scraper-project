I love taking pictures of my lawn -- maybe even more than of my kids. A hobby or obsession? Either way, a good-looking yard is important to me. My precious free time (not consumed by work and family obligations) is usually spent on lawn maintenance, with an embarrassing amount of additional hours spent researching different seeds, fertilizer and, most importantly, the right mowing equipment to achieve the perfect lawn.  Our Picks

How we test electric lawn mowers
I spent months testing nine of the best electric lawn mowers on the market from top brands, including Milwaukee, Stihl, Ryobi, Craftsman and EgoPower. I cut multiple acres of grass with each mower (mine and my two neighbors’ yards). I tested each mower uphill, on flat ground and with different grass types. As the husband of CNET's home tech editor, I've had an inside look at how expert reviewers assess the best new products and I knew this was my opportunity to share my expertise and passion for lawn care. I chose not to get paid for this article, and an editor who's not my wife also reviewed it.I found these mowers to be a cut above the rest.
My backyard after cutting with the Milwaukee M18 Fuel. I’m one of those people who takes pictures of their grass -- possibly even more than of their kids. I haven’t gone so far as to hang any of these pictures over the living room mantle, but let's not rule anything out just yet. Andrew Collins/CNETBest electric lawn mowers of 2025

Best overall electric mower
The Milwaukee M18 Fuel 21-inch mower
9.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Consistently delivers a clean, even cut -- even in tough conditions
Fast and powerful, delivering “gas-like” performance
Great performance at lower cutting heights, down to 1 inch
Commercial-grade build quality
Cons
Expensive -- one of the highest-priced models tested
Requires two batteries to operate, increasing downtime between charges
Variable Speed Self-Propulsion lever is uncomfortable to use for long periods
The Milwaukee M18 Fuel 21-inch consistently delivered the best cutting experience over all other mowers tested. The build quality immediately stands out right from unboxing, from the 15-gauge steel deck to the premium feel of the handlebar and batteries. It’s a fast, powerful machine that delivers the most “gas-like" feel when set against its competitors. In other words, if all nine mowers had a backyard brawl after we humans went to sleep, the Milwaukee would be the heavy favorite to walk away victorious.Why I like it: In the harshest conditions, after heavy rains had delayed my normal cutting schedule and the grass was overlong and thick, the Milwaukee consistently delivered a clean cut time after time. Other tested mowers needed multiple passes to achieve an acceptable cut in these conditions, oftentimes bogging down and coming to a complete standstill, while the Milwaukee would power through with ease. Under more optimal conditions, making a 1-inch cut, the Milwaukee M18 FEUL continued to excel. The evenness of the cut produced by the Milwaukee, especially when deploying the high lift mode, was superior to other mowers.The variable Speed Self-Propulsion system isn’t the most comfortable design -- the lever can cause hand and thumb fatigue over time -- but it’s extremely powerful, reaching speeds up to 4 mph. The LED lights are also no gimmick, delivering plenty of visibility to keep mowing well into dusk.The electric mower segment is highly competitive, and we’ve tested some really good mowers over the course of this review. That said, when my testing was over and the grass needed a good mow, the Milwaukee was always the first mower I would reach for.Who it’s best for: Those looking for a commercial-grade machine and a commercial-grade cut will be extremely satisfied with the Milwaukee's results. The M18 REDLITHIUM 12.0 batteries more than hold their own against the competition, delivering impressive cut times even when operating in high lift mode and utilizing self-propulsion often. Who shouldn't get it: If you're looking for the best value or a wider cutting radius, the Milwaukee may not be the choice for you. The Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch mower provides a wider cut, reducing your overall cut time. Its cut quality and overall performance are impressive at a price that’s several hundred dollars less.  ...

Best value and best for large yards
Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch mower
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Widest cut of mowers tested at 25 inches, for faster mowing
Above average fit and finish compared to other mowers in its segment
Dual-port AutoSwitch technology allows a second battery to automatically take over when the first is drained
Cons
The automatic handoff from a depleted battery to a full one is a bit jarring, with a noticeable performance change
Sometimes cumbersome to maneuver when using the rear wheels lock (which prevents roll-back when disengaging self-propulsion)
Why I like it: The Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch Dual Blade Mower is truly a good value. I’m surprised at how inexpensive it is considering its performance. It boasts several well-thought-out design elements, separating it from the majority of competitors in the electric mower segment. The Greenworks' 25-inch cutting circumference reduces overall mowing times, the dual battery bay with AutoSwitch Technology allows you to keep mowing without swapping batteries and the overall cut quality exceeds that of many of its competitors. Despite its increased width, the mower is very compact and easily maneuverable over hills and around trees and fences. Who it’s best for: If you're in the market for a high-quality mower and don’t want to break the bank, this mower fits the bill. It checks a lot of boxes for what an ideal electric mower should be. If you have a larger yard, the extra-wide cut paired with above-average battery life, will help you get the job done quicker than any of the other mowers tested in this review. Who shouldn't get it: I found the wheel locking feature when disengaging self-propulsion annoying. When you want to reverse the mower to make a turn, you have to either push the mower forward or wait a few seconds to disengage the wheel lock. If you have a narrower yard that requires frequent quick turns, the wheel locking could get old in a hurry.  ... Show more

Best self-propulsion system
Toro Recycler 60V 22-inch mower
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Personal Pace self-propel system makes the mower very easy to maneuver
Self-propulsion system makes it easier to cut uphill
Good cut quality, even without a turbo or boost mode
Cons
Battery charge times are excessively long at 3.5 hours
No single-point blade height adjustment feature
Battery cover cracks easily
Why I like it: The Toro Recycler 60V 22-inch has the best self-propulsion system of any of the tested mowers. Despite being on the heavier side, the Personal Pace system from Toro makes pushing and maneuvering this mower almost effortless. The cut quality is visually exceptional, even without a turbo or boost mode. There are some drawbacks, but overall, the Toro is a solid mower for the price. Who it’s best for: If struggling to push a mower on a hot, humid day sounds like a cruel form of punishment, the Toro has your back. It won't make it any less hot or humid, but it’ll feel more like taking a leisurely stroll than wrestling a hunk of metal across the yard. A minor win, but you have to take them where you can get them. If you have a sloped or hilly yard, the Personal Pace system is destined to be your new summertime buddy. Who shouldn't get it: While the Toro stood out for its Personal Pace propulsion system, other design elements are less welcome. The Toro is the only tested mower without a single-point blade height adjustment mechanism. Think back to the old mowers from your childhood, requiring individual wheel height adjustments by moving a thin bar of aluminum on each wheel, and that’s what you’ll be signing up for with this Toro. It’s not necessarily a deal-breaker, but not something you would expect from an otherwise premium product. If you need to change blade heights often when cutting different sections of your yard, the Milwaukee and Greenworks offer a much more seamless approach in both quality and ease of use.  ...

Best maneuverability and splurge pick
Stihl RMA 453 PV 21-inch mower
9.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
The mono-comfort handlebar and height adjustment features are the most ergonomically friendly of all tested mowers
Three cut mode options: ECO, Standard and Auto Boost
The polymer grass bag catcher, with indicator for when full, is class-leading
Cons
20-inch blade is smaller than most competitors
Highest MSRP price of the tested mowers, with only 1 battery included
Battery runtime is disappointing, especially when using Auto Boost mode
Why I like it: The Stihl RMA 453 PV 21-inch is the Ferrari of electric lawn mowers. It's buttery smooth while operating, which is not an adjective you’d expect to use for any lawn mower. Every aspect of this mower is incredibly well-designed. The mono-comfort handlebar, a feature not found on any of the other mowers tested, makes it easier to empty the polymer grass bag and to store the mower. A well-designed electronic control panel shows real-time battery levels and makes switching between three cutting modes easy.Because of its polymer design, the Stihl is lightweight -- at just 64 pounds -- and easy to control and maneuver. Overall, this is a premium piece of lawn-mowing technology that’s frankly in a different league than all of its competitors. Oh, and it cuts grass exceptionally well, too. Who it’s best for: The Stihl brand has a well-earned reputation for making quality, reliable products, and the Stihl RMA 453 PV 21-inch is no exception. If price isn’t a leading factor in your mower search, the Stihl offers many beneficial design elements that just aren’t found on the other mowers we’ve tested. The polymer materials are much lighter and easier to clean than steel or standard plastics. The grass bag has a visual indicator to let you know when it’s full and the unique mono-comfort handlebar design further reduces weight and makes for a smaller storage footprint.Who shouldn't get it: The Stihl may be the Ferrari of electric mowers, but certain jobs need a work truck, not a sports car. The Stihl can get bogged down by high, thick grassy conditions that the Milwaukee manages without strain. If you’re maintaining a thick, dense lawn at a low cut height, I recommend a mower with more umph, such as the Milwaukee M18 Fuel.  ... Show more

Other electric lawn mowers we tested
Ryobi HP Brushless 21-inch Multiblade
Andrew Collins/CNETThe Ryobi is the ultimate jack of all trades, master of none among electric lawn mowers. While it doesn’t stand out as the best when it comes to any particular feature or category, it also doesn’t score poorly on any metric. Battery life, cut quality and maneuverability are all acceptable, and the Ryobi is a solid all-rounder for the price. You could do better, but also a whole lot worse when choosing an electric mower. Pros:No wheel lock when disengaging self-propulsionPrice to value is competitiveConsBattery life lowered substantially when using Turbo mode for extended periodsDoesn’t include a dual battery charger like some other brands doErgonomics for self-propulsion could be improved. Not the most comfortableEGO Power Plus 21-inch Select Cut XP
Andrew Collins/CNETThe Ego Power Plus 21-inch Select Cut XP was the biggest surprise during testing. The Ego brand is highly regarded in the electric power equipment market, and this Ego does indeed have some excellent features and design elements to boast about. Three different blade options are included in the box, something no other competitor offers. The single-point height adjustment is really well thought out; it’s IPX4-rated for a bit of weatherproofing and the phone holder is a nice touch.However, in our testing, the Ego cut quality just wasn’t up to the standard laid down by its competitors. There was a noticeable mohawk effect evident on each pass, leaving strips of uneven grass on the edges of the cut. The Ego wasn’t alone in this regard, but many other mowers offer a High Lift, Boost or Turbo mode to reduce this effect and provide a more even cut, a feature that this Ego doesn’t offer. Additionally, while it's an attractive machine, the Ego seems longer and wider than it really needs to be, affecting maneuverability around trees and other obstacles, while delivering a less even cut on sloped yards.
With the Ego Power Plus 21-inch Select Cut XP, each pass left a visible mohawk effect, with strips of uncut grass along the edges. Andrew Collins/CNETPros:Three different lower blades included for different cutting optionsExcellent lever for easily changing cut positionOverall fit and finish of the mower is ahead of many competitorsConsCut quality is disappointingly uneven, with lots of mohawking on the edgesNo Turbo or Boost modeBulkier than many competitors, making it less maneuverableEcho DLM-2100SPThe Echo DLM-2100SP has a lot of similarities to the higher-rated Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch Dual Blade mower, which is both good and bad. Both have excellent self-propulsion controls, as well as dual battery bays and excellent battery life. Not as good, the Echo, like the Greenworks, has the annoying wheel lock “feature” when disengaging the Self Propulsion system, requiring you to either wait a few seconds or manually push the mower forward to be able to reverse direction. The biggest differentiator between the Echo and Greenworks is the cutting radius, with the Greenworks offering the wider cut at 25 inches versus 21 inches for the Echo. Considering the Greenworks is $140 cheaper, it’s hard to recommend the Echo over it. That said, the Echo is the sharper-looking of the two, if looks are important to you.
Andrew Collins/CNETPros:Creates a nice stripping patternLightweight, with good propulsion levers and speed controlGood battery level feedback indicatorsCons:Grass blade lift could be better, especially when mowing downhillDeck bottoms out easily at minimum cut heightWheel lock when disengaging self-propulsion is very annoyingGreen Machine 62V 23-inch RWDGreen Machine is one of the lesser-known brands tested on this list, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see that change in the years to come. The Green Machine 62V 23” has a lot to offer on a price-to-value scale, but a few key drawbacks held it from ranking higher on this list. The main drawback, far and away, was battery life. While the 45-minute stated runtime is theoretically attainable, use of the Self Propulsion system greatly diminishes that time. While most of the tested mowers on this list could cut my sloped,  two-thirds of an acre yard in just two or three battery cycles, the Green Machine required four to five cycles. With a battery recharge time of 75 minutes, this made for a very long and tedious testing experience. If primarily used on smaller, flatter lawns, the Green Machine is a solid budget option to consider.
Andrew Collins/CNETPros:Good build qualityAttractive designCompetitively pricedCons:Not as maneuverable as other options in this price segmentNot great lift from the blade, leaving the cut shaggy at timesEasy to accidentally change the speed when turning the mowerSelf-propel drains the battery quicklyCraftsman V20 20-inchThe Craftsman V20 20-inch was the lightest of our tested mowers, and also the cheapest based on MSRP. It is easy to push and provides surprisingly long battery life for its smaller-sized battery, which helps with storage. While these are all great features, it's still difficult to recommend the Craftsman due to its lack of power and subpar cut quality. Its self-propulsion system is basic, with little variable speed control, with a simple pull handle either engaging or disengaging the system. The mower is also the least powerful of those tested. It can handle light trimming just fine, but high, thick grass is more than it can comfortably manage.The Craftsman V20 would be best suited to small, flat yards, much like the Green Machine mentioned above. But there are better mowers that can be purchased for just a bit more money if you need self-propulsion. If you’re after the Craftsman’s lightweight design and compact size, the non Self-Propulsion version -- $120 cheaper -- would likely be a better fit.
Andrew Collins/CNETPros:Light and compact, easy to maneuver and storeLowest MSRP of any of the tested mowersGood battery life from 4.0Ah batteriesCons:Not very powerful, with marginal cut qualityVery basic self-propulsion system, with limited speed adjustmentWhat we updated: May 2025: We changed how we test electric lawn mowers, updating the testing methodology and assigning a new tester and author.June 2025: We retested these electric lawn mowers for consideration on our list: Milwaukee M18 Fuel 21-inch; Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch; Toro Recycler 60V 22-inch; Stihl RMA 453 PV 21-inch; Ryobi HP Brushless 21-inch; Ego Power Plus 21-inch; Echo DLM-2100SP; Green Machine 62V 23-inch; Craftsman V20 20-inch.July 2025: We retested the Ego Power Plus 21-inch 56-volt and removed it as the best overall pick.July 2025: We recategorized Greenworks 25-inch 60-volt from the “best for consistent lawn maintenance” to the “best value.” July 2025: We removed the Greenworks 19-inch 40-volt and the Litheli U20LM00-0A120 13-inch 20-volt from this list.  July 2025: We removed the Dewalt DCMWP233U2 21.5-inch 20-volt from this list because it's currently out of stock. August 2025: The former authors’ bylines (Steve Conaway, Chris Wedell and Macy Meyer) were removed from this page following new testing and evaluation. Factors to consider when choosing an electric lawn mower
Charging timesDepending on the size of your lawn, battery charging times can either be of minimal or great importance when selecting a mower. Most electric mowers are able to handle close to a quarter acre in a single battery charge. If you have a larger yard, you'll want a mower that comes with multiple batteries or has very quick charge times on individual batteries.Cut qualityMany factors can influence the cut quality a mower delivers during each mowing session. Grass type, height and density can lead to vastly different cutting experiences from one yard to the next. When mulch-cutting a yard, the cut quality will be better when cutting just one inch of grass compared to multiple inches. Higher, denser grass may require you to utilize a mower's boost or turbo modes, which improves the cut quality, but can reduce battery run times -- sometimes drastically. The greater the lift a lawn mower blade can generate, the better the cut will be. Poor lift leaves you with uncut blades with every pass, resulting in a shaggy-looking yard. Many mower brands sell specialized high-lift blades to prevent this issue, but these blades often result in lower battery run times.Price Like most material purchases, price to value will play a significant role in choosing the best mower. While the Milwaukee M18 Fuel is rated as our best overall mower, there are lawns that don’t require such a large investment. Those with smaller yards or those whose primary concern is getting the grass cut as easily and painlessly as possible, but not necessarily looking for the most premium cut quality, would be wise to purchase a more economical electric lawn mower such as the Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch Dual Blade. ManeuverabilityA mower that's easy to maneuver and doesn't make it feel like you added an extra gym session to your weekly routine is highly important, especially for those with larger, sloped landscapes. Being able to cut close to fence edges and around trees further reduces time spent trimming and weeding those hard-to-reach areas.  Cutting heightMowers can have vastly different blade height options to choose between, and these can be a significant factor in choosing the mower that's right for you. While most mowers all have a maximum cut height that's close to 4 inches, some can cut as low as 0.8 inches, while others may only cut as low as 1.75 inches. If maintaining a close cropped yard is important to you, paying close attention to these cutting height positions will help you pick the right mower for your needs. How we test electric lawn mowers
Testing was conducted over a four-month span from the beginning of April through July. All mowers were tested on the same lawn, under similar mowing conditions. The grass I cut is on a moderately sloped two-thirds acre lot. Early cuts were made on primarily a bluegrass/perennial rye grass lawn with a transition to a Bermuda lawn as the season changed.
I used my smartwatch to record the distance and duration of each mower’s battery cycle. This image is a visual look of my front yard.  Screenshot by Andrew Collins/CNETEach mow was tracked using a Garmin Epix Pro smartwatch to record distance and duration of each battery cycle. We used this data, along with a visual inspection of cut quality, and evaluated the mowing experience subjectively based on overall maneuverability and the performance of each mower’s self-propulsion system. Each mower was then compared to the others I tested and given a score out of 10 across these seven categories:Price to valueCut quality Run time vs. charge timeManeuverability Self-propulsion control and ease of useDesign and build qualityOverall user satisfaction rating
A visual look at my back and side yards, using my smartwatch.  Screenshot by Andrew Collins/CNETPrice to value is based on each mower's sale price at the time of review versus its overall satisfaction rating with the mower over the course of testing. The Greenworks was easily the winner in this category, being the third highest-rated mower in overall satisfaction and the cheapest to purchase. While the Craftsman had a low sales price, this wasn’t enough to overcome its low overall satisfaction rating.  Price to value MowerScoreRank Greenworks ($599) 9.51stMilwaukee ($999) 8.52ndToro ($599)

I evaluated cut quality by how well the yard looked after each mow, as well as how the mower handled the varying conditions thrown at it. Missed grass blades, especially those requiring second passes to achieve a satisfactory cut, lowered the score. The mower bogging down or not being able to achieve the desired cut height would also lower the score. While the Stihl provided an exceptional cut in easy to moderate conditions, the Milwaukee’s ability to handle extreme conditions with ease, especially at minimum cutting heights, propelled it to the top of the leaderboard in this category.

Testing the Greenworks Pro 60V 25-inch Dual-Blade. Andrew Collins/CNETIt’s one thing to have solid battery life, but if you're dealing with larger yards that require more than a battery or two to complete a mowing, battery charge times can be just as important. The Toro and Craftsman were examples of excessively long charge times, greatly diminishing the value in using these mowers on larger lots. Both the Greenworks and Echo demonstrated an ideal mix of good battery longevity with relatively quick recharges.

Maneuverability scoring is based on how easily a mower could be pushed across the lawn, factoring in turns and cutting along fences, trees and other obstacles. The rear wheel locking when disengaging self-propulsion greatly affected the overall maneuverability of the Greenworks, Echo, Craftsman and Green Machine, while the Stihl's polymer design and flawless ergonomics scored highest in the class.  Maneuverability

A well-integrated, easy-to-deploy self-propulsion system can make mowing a near effortless experience, while an underpowered self-propulsion system with bad ergonomics and poor speed control can make the mowing experience very tedious. The Toro and Stihl excelled with their designs, offering easy to use systems that improved the overall mowing experience.

While taking vastly different approaches in design and materials, the Stihl and Milwaukee mowers stand out from a design and build standpoint. The Stihl's polymer construction provides a strong, yet lightweight frame that's easy to clean and maintain. The Milwaukee is more rugged and it feels ready to take a head-on collision from a rhino and keep on mowing.  Design and build quality MowerScoreRank Stihl 10.01stMilwaukee 9.52ndGreenworks 9.03rdRyobi 8.84thEgo 8.55thEcho 8.36thToro 8.07thGreen Machine 7.58thCraftsman 7.39th

Electric lawn mower FAQs
Is an electric mower better than a gas mower?
Electric and gas mowers both come with unique pros and cons. While gas mowers can often be cheaper, more powerful and better suited for large yards, electric mowers can be quieter, easier to maneuver and generally easier to use and store. Electric mowers are typically considered more environmentally friendly, too.
Are battery electric lawn mowers the same as corded electric lawn mowers?
While both battery and electric mowers use electricity to operate, they're not the same as corded electric lawn mowers. While battery electric lawn mowers are generally more expensive than their corded counterparts, battery lawn mowers provide a much superior cutting experience since you aren’t tethered to a cord and outlet.
What is the best electric lawn mower?
In our testing, the Milwaukee M18 Fuel 21-inch is the best electric mower overall.
What's the best time of year to buy an electric lawn mower?
Late summer into early fall is typically a good time to buy a new electric mower. Older models are often discounted to clear inventory for new models soon to be released.
Is it safe to mow wet grass with an electric mower?
It is not safe to mow wet grass with an electric mower for numerous reasons. While the risk of electrocution is low, a wet lawn can cause damage to your mower. There's also an increased likelihood of slipping on wet turf while mowing.
How long does an electric lawn mower last?
Electric mowers themselves can easily last five to 10 years, though individual batteries will likely have a much shorter life, depending on usage and storage conditions.
Can I wash or hose down my electric lawn mower?
While different mowers will have different IPX ratings (the measurement of water resistance), hosing down an electric mower can damage its electronics. Using a leaf blower to clean the mower's deck is a much safer alternative.
What are the drawbacks of electric mowers?
Electric mowers can be more expensive than their gas counterparts -- and sometimes less powerful. Battery range isn’t a major factor for average-sized lawns (about half an acre), but it could be a drawback for yards larger than an acre.
What are the benefits of an electric lawn mower?
There are many benefits to electric lawn mowers. They're generally lighter, easier to start and maintain and quieter than their gas counterparts.
