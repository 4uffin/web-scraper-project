Why order flowers online?
How we tested and reviewed flower delivery services
With so many online flower delivery services available, it can be tricky to pick the right one -- especially for procrastinators who need a gift delivered quickly. That's why we ordered flowers from major national online florists, and from niche vendors with specialized styles like rustic, tropical and modern, to help you decide which service to go with. Some impressed us with their quality or price, others with their speedy delivery. Check out our favorites below to find the right fit for your needs. And if you're looking for other gift ideas for the botanically-minded people in your life, stroll through our list of the best indoor gardens.
This story is part of
Gift Guide, our year-round collection of the best gift ideas.
What's the best flower delivery service overall? Quality matters, and it's easy to get flowers that are wilted or poorly arranged. Finding good flowers means picking the right source, whether you're ordering a simple bouquet of roses or a complicated yet beautiful arrangement of diverse blooms.After extensive testing, we found that The Bouqs Co. proved to be the best overall flower delivery service, with vibrant blooms that showed little to no wilt. We also appreciated the elegant yet simple style of Bouqs' offerings, and the bounty of bouquets available for next-day delivery -- and same-day delivery in some locations. While The Bouqs Co. is our top pick overall, we'd recommend going with FTD Flowers for truly last-minute orders, since it has arrangements ready to go for same-day delivery.If the individual you're sending something to happens to be more of a houseplant person or a gardener type, these are the best online plant delivery services and the best garden box and seed delivery services for 2025.Read more: How to Keep Flowers Fresh for Longer: Tips That WorkBest Place to Buy Plants Online

The Bouqs Co.
Pros
Quality
Deal of the week offerings provide even better savings
Wide selection of flowers
Beyond the fun name, this online flower delivery service offers an impressive variety of floral arrangements, plants and more for Valentine's Day, birthdays and other special occasions.Bouqs sources its flowers and plants from eco-friendly sustainable farms and offers same-day and next-day delivery if needed. This service also offers seasonal arrangements of fresh blooms, like the Sweet Escape arrangement, as well as more traditional bouquets, like the Angels, a burst of light pink roses.What we liked and didn't like: Bouqs lands on our list of best flower delivery services not just for its large selection but also because it creatively designs so many of its offerings, and they look really cool. It was hard to choose from all the beautiful flower arrangements (which I suppose could be a bad thing). I ordered the Wild About U bouquet, and it arrived fresh, fragrant and on time to my delivery area.Beyond classic bouquet picks, Bouqs also sells succulents, cacti, plants and potted flowers, like this orchid. The cleverly assembled Wild About U is a unique arrangement that mixes freshly cut flowers with succulents, which can be potted up or planted outside. Insider tip: In an admittedly unscientific experiment, we found that Bouqs' flowers last a lot longer if you don't use the powder-coated metal vase that comes with some options. Flowers lasted about three days in that vase before they started to wilt, versus about a week in a glass vase.Bouqs also offers subscriptions, so you can regularly have fresh flowers delivered to your door. Or someone else's -- it's a thoughtful floral gift that keeps on giving, and you'll save roughly 30% compared with a one-time purchase. Subscriptions start at $48 per month (with free shipping).  ...

Same-day delivery available
Cons
Flowers were less fragrant than with our other picks
For some people, the best flower delivery service is the one that doesn't break the bank. And you can find cheap flower arrangements that don't look cheap. Let's call them budget-friendly bouquets, shall we? Truth be told, you're probably not going to find flowers at rock-bottom prices on or around a major flower-giving holiday (unless you grow them yourself), so it may be a fool's errand to try. That said, 1-800-Flowers.com has solid deals on flowers if you're trying not to spend a fortune. We found flower bouquets on sale from this popular delivery service, including two dozen roses starting at around $40.What we liked and didn't like: Arrangements from 1-800-Flowers may not have the same wow factor as what you find at other delivery services on our list, but if you're buying for someone with classic taste, you can't go wrong ordering beautiful flowers from this tried-and-true online florist. The flowers I ordered showed up bright and fresh, though not terribly fragrant.I really appreciated the bargain bouquets, including some bunches available for as little as $30. 1-800-Flowers also offers same-day delivery and other gifting options, such as plants, keepsakes, fruit bouquets and a number of eats and trinkets you can add to your purchase. Insider tip: Check the sale section before you decide on a full-price bouquet.Bouquets that caught our eye include the $45 assortment of roses and Peruvian lilies and the Lovely Lavender Medley, made up of white roses and carnations, lavender and Peruvian lilies.  ...

Best flower subscription
BloomsyBox
Pros
Weekly and monthly subscriptions available
Cons
Not as intuitive an ordering experience
If you think a single bouquet of flowers isn't enough, how about a monthly delivery of fresh flowers or arrangements? Flower subscription services are becoming increasingly popular, ensuring the delivery of beautiful blooms month after month, and that's what sets BloomsyBox apart. You can set up weekly, biweekly or monthly delivery of hand-tied bouquets from sustainable farms. What we liked and didn't like: BloomsyBox flowers are high quality. When mine arrived, they seemed a little sad, but they perked up in a vase of water and stayed perky for nearly a week. On the downside, I'll say it was one of my least favorite ordering experiences of the bunch. Things like adding a note weren't very intuitive, and when I tried to track my order, there was almost no information available. I had to start a chat with the chatbot to get any sort of update.BloomsyBox subscriptions start at $55 a month for a hydrangea subscription or $60 a month for the original subscription. Or you can spring for the deluxe and premium bouquets. The spendier plans feature more flowers per delivery. BloomsyBox also has a full inventory of bouquets you can order and send as a one-time gift.  ... Show more

Best flower presentation
Farmgirl Flowers
Pros
Free Ship Shop offers a wide variety of bouquets with free shipping
Because of my own positive experiences and those of a handful of others on the CNET team, Farmgirl Flowers is our pick for best presentation by a flower delivery service.This popular San Francisco-based service is known for its ethically grown flowers and burlap-wrapped bouquets, and they're all extremely Instagram- or Pinterest-ready, bursting with flowers. The overall selection isn't as vast as what you find at some other online florists, but what Farmgirl Flower does, it does well. There's a specific rustic look to Farmgirl's bountiful arrangements, too, that's underscored by the burlap wrap each beautiful bouquet is swathed in.What we liked and didn't like: Something about my Farmgirl Flowers bouquet just felt more special than most of the others. Maybe it was that burlap wrap or that the fresh bouquet itself seemed more full, but in terms of overall presentation, Farmgirl was the clear winner among the services we tested. My bouquet also seemed to get quite a bit more lively after I gave it water and flower food in keeping with the friendly instructions, and it kept that fresh form for a solid week.Other members of the CNET team had similar positive experiences, with one recalling how much her mother "loved the packaging and raved about how beautiful the floral bouquet was." Another remembers the "super healthy flowers and cool combinations" they had to choose from. Bouquets start at about $55 and go up from there.   ... Show more

Best for last-minute flower delivery
FTD Flowers
Pros
Dozens of options for same-day or next-day delivery
Cons
Less-creative bouquets
No subscription option
If you're in a pinch and need flowers, like, yesterday, FTD is my pick for last-minute delivery. FTD Flowers has a whole bunch of arrangements available at a moment's notice, along with categories including floral centerpieces such as the Smiles and Sunshine arrangement that includes a vase, all for just $65 (and $55 without a vase). There are also potted plants and edible add-ons to choose from, such as chocolates and candies. You can opt for same- or next-day delivery on many of these products, too. What we liked and didn't like: I wasn't bowled over by the selection of flowers from FTD -- the arrangements seemed a bit boring -- but I was impressed with how many bouquets and flowers it had available for same-day and next-day delivery. There are as many as 48 bouquets you can order and have delivered within 24 hours, so it's an ideal flower delivery option for any last-minute Larrys. I ordered the Hello Sunshine bouquet, which indeed came the next day, and the fresh flowers were in great shape -- some of the most vibrant of any I received. Plus, all the arrangements come with a vase, so there's no work to be done for the giftee!Insider tip: Despite FTD's speedy service, be warned: It's always better to place your order in advance if you need the flowers for a major holiday like Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Christmas or New Year's Eve.  ...

Best for a tropical bouquet
BloomsyBox
Pros
Fresh and fragrant bouquets
Tropical subscription available
In addition to the great subscription service mentioned above, BloomsyBox offers some seriously cool bouquets of tropical flowers. I had one sent to my mom and she loved it, calling it "very sci-fi" and like nothing she'd ever been sent before (see photo). BloomsyBox has about six tropical bouquets using flowers sourced from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms, and they start at around $60. What we liked and didn't like: These fiery tropical flowers showed up incredibly fresh and fragrant. Of all the arrangements, they looked like they'd been cut most recently, and they lasted a solid week. Some other bouquets I ordered seemed a bit more full, but this one was by no means sad or scraggly.   ... Show more

Best for a modern flower arrangement
UrbanStems
Pros
Low-maintenance options
Same-day delivery available
If you're looking for a modern arrangement with unique blooms and contemporary colors, our flower delivery service of choice is UrbanStems. This online florist works with sustainable farms to offer a wide selection of chic floral arrangements and potted plants. What we liked and didn't like: The sleek, modern bouquets are what set this service apart. The classic bouquets are fine, but they're nothing special or out of the ordinary -- though mine did last longer than some other bouquets. UrbanStems also has great add-on treats. The ordering interface is simple, and the flowers I ordered arrived on time and were fresh and healthy, although not very fragrant.Insider tip: UrbanStems has some solid add-ons, like Belgian Neuhaus chocolate truffles and fancy Sugarfina candies. I added both and enjoyed them while staring at my flowers.UrbanStems delivers anywhere in the country, and products run the gamut from classic lush bouquets, such as The Type A Mom with roses, veronica and carnations, to the more contemporary styles we touched on earlier. The service also offers delivery on a selection of plants. The Cathy, for instance, is a low-maintenance xerographic air plant that might make a better pick for someone without a green thumb.Bouquets start at $59, with most arrangements in the $60 to $80 range. Some are so delicate that they require hand delivery, while others are shipped through more traditional methods. Delivery date options are listed for each bouquet.  ... Show more

Best option for flowers from local florists
Floom
Pros
Same-day delivery available
Cons
Not available nationwide
It's always nice to support local businesses when you can, and Floom pulls from a network of independent florists in a few major US cities to fulfill orders. You can currently order Floom flowers from local businesses in New York City, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and a few other cities. A talented local florist will put together your arrangement to have it delivered when you need it.Because the service is somewhat location-based, your flower options will depend on where you're having the bouquet delivered. Floom also has same-day delivery options, if you lost track of time and a special occasion suddenly crept up and left you unable to get to an actual flower shop in time.  ... Show more

Venus et Fleur
A floral splurge that will last up to a year
Venus et Fleur preserved roses
Pros
Can last up to a year with no watering or maintenance
Cons
Very expensive, luxury option
Let's start by saying that Venus et Fleur's flowers are definitely a vibe and perhaps not the right pick for everyone, especially considering their price. If these boxes of roses look familiar, it's probably because they're always popping up on celebrity social media accounts, including the Kardashians'. The big draw is that they're preserved to last as long as a full year before wilting. They're also treated with synthetic scents to give them an olfactory edge over the competition.If you're looking for something truly luxe, take a browse through the sleek brand's floral inventory. Small boxes with a single rose start at $59 (yes, for one rose), while more lavish displays can cost a whole lot more, upward of $1,000. You can also choose from a variety of rose colors and containers, including bold metallic and rainbow varieties. And you can get peonies, hydrangeas and other flowers as well.  ... Show more

Add to compareWhy order flowers online?
We love supporting local businesses, and if there's a flower shop near you that can get bushels of blooms where you need them when you need them, we say go for it. But if you're sending roses across state lines or even city lines, it might be easier to use one of these online flower shops, since they specialize in mail-order flowers. That includes ensuring they arrive looking as fresh as a dozen daisies. Buying flowers online means more variety
Flowers are a must for special occasions. Getty ImagesMost online flower markets also have an incredible variety; certainly more than most grocery stores. If you have a very specific idea of what types of flowers or flower arrangements you'd like to send, online flower delivery is likely your best bet. We're talking rare and exotic flowers, fresh-cut flowers, potted plants, floral-inspired gift baskets bursting with fruits and sweets, or simple bunches of roses, dahlias and sunflowers. Online options include various floral arrangement styles: ultramodern flower arrangements, natural and rustic bouquets, and bunches of rare and preserved roses. If you want flowers on the regular, there are even flower subscription services that'll ship freshly cut flowers to someone every month for three, six or 12 months.Read more: Best Places to Buy Plants Online1-800-Flowers.com and FTD offer cheap flower deliveryThe flower delivery category has evolved into offerings for every budget and taste.

Online flower delivery FAQs
Can I get flowers delivered within 24 hours?
Yes, you technically can have flowers delivered within 24 hours. However, when it comes to big holidays, you really want to get your order in as soon as possible. That said, FTD Flowers does have bouquets ready to be shipped out for same-day delivery, and other services offer expedited options.
What is the cheapest online flower delivery service?
Flowers are generally expensive, but the flower delivery category has evolved, with offerings for every budget and taste. If you take a look at some of the top online flower delivery services, you can find deals on cheap flowers, including bouquets starting at $30 or $40. Consistently, 1-800-Flowers.com and FTD Flowers had some of the cheapest bouquets we found. Don't forget to check the sale section for any discounted flowers that might be a good pick for your loved one.
How long does flower delivery take?
Most flower deliveries take a few days to arrive, but there's no shortage of services that offer next-day and even same-day delivery. Typically, you'll pay an extra fee for expedited flower delivery, so it's in your best interests to plan ahead and send flowers at least a week in advance.
Can you order flowers online from local florists?
Yes, services such as Teleflora and Floom draw from local florists to fulfill orders. You can also order flowers online directly from many florists through their websites.
Will the new tariffs affect flower prices?
Recently, the Trump administration proposed a new 25% tariff on goods imported from Colombia, which is a major supplier of fresh-cut flowers. If the new trade agreement is implemented, these additional fees will likely be passed on to American consumers, which could mean higher prices for your next bouquet.
How we tested and reviewed flower delivery services
To make online bouquet buying a breeze, we've tested some of the most popular flower delivery services to weed out the duds and help you find the perfect gift for whoever you think deserves a bushel of blooms (even if that's you!). Though we didn't try every single flower delivery service, we've noted the ones we did try and what we liked or didn't like about them. We considered things such as the overall flower type, ordering process, delivery fee, tracking and how the blooms looked, smelled and held up over time after arriving. We included our picks for specific considerations, too, such as the best flower delivery for last-minute gifts, the best flower subscription, and the best online flower shop for modern bouquets.We tested the first six flower delivery services on this list and included a few others we haven't yet tried, because they have unique offerings that might appeal to you. We'll update this best flower delivery service article with our thoughts on those others when we've had a chance to test them.
