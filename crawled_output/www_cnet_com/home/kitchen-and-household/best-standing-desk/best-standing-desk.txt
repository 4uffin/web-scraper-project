This can lead to brain fog and muscle fatigue. But with the best standing desk, you can take some time to adjust your posture and stand for a while. We've tested over a dozen desks to find the best durability and features when you're ready to upgrade your office furniture. Our Picks

Factors to consider when buying a standing desk
Complete your setup
Being able to change your standing desk height and work where it's comfortable for you has some great health benefits. The best desk for each person will depend largely on the desk's intended use and several other factors. To find a reliable standing desk we looked for quality desktop materials, tall heights, a strong lifting column and more. Add in the best office chair for the moments you're sitting and you'll be in for a much easier work day.What is the best standing desk?In my testing, I found one desk that stands out among the others: the Branch Standing Desk. With a midlevel price tag and high-end build quality, the Branch perfectly fits most people's standing desk needs. It has four programmable heights, and the base is so sturdy that the desk feels solid, even at full extension.What we updated: December 2024We added the Branch Four Leg Standing Desk.February 2025We added the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 standing desk.April 2025We added the Branch Desk Riser.

SCORE
Pros
Lightweight and premium feeling materials
Quick and easy assembly
Can be assembled solo if needed
Memory of four heights
Cable tidy
Color options
Cons
Generic look
Very business-like feeling
Why I like it:At first glance, the Branch standing desk looks pretty generic, but the level of craftsmanship is apparent on closer inspection. All of the materials feel premium with a weight that only comes from good engineering. Putting it together was simple and only took about 30 minutes on my own, though I think having two people would reduce that significantly. It was also extremely well packaged -- something that Branch does with all its products -- so it was in top shape once I had it all together. The Branch desk can remember four separate heights and has a handy cable door at the back to keep your desk clear and tidy.  Who is it for:Those looking to replace their desk in an office or who regularly work from home will find this to be a great business-like desk. It's tidy, professional and very easy to use. Even if you don't like the office look, the warmer woods and grey leg options can give it a bit more personality as well. If you are furnishing an office, the Branch desk and Verve office chair from our best office chairs make a great combination.Who shouldn't buy it:While the desk is well built with quality materials and is a great fit for most people, if you are looking for more features on your desk outside of the raising ability or something more on the budget side, this may not be the pick for you. Also, while there are options to give the desk a bit more of a unique look, it does tend to lean more toward a business-looking desk, so if you want personality, there may be a better choice for you.-- James Bricknell  ...

Best budget standing desk
Ikea Trotten standing desk
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Balance of cost and quality
The hand crank is fun
Cons
Some assembly issues
Why I like it:This simple sit-stand desk nails the basics. The Trotten measures 47.25 by 27.5 inches. It has a sturdy, easy-to-clean work surface made of particleboard and fiberboard, as well as a steel base for a stable standing desk. This adjustable standing desk model doesn't have electric controls to raise or lower the desk height, but the manual hand crank (which can be mounted on the right or the left side), was easy to turn for adjustments. When you're done using it, you can slide it back under the desk.Who is it for:The Ikea Trotten is an excellent option when you need a larger standing desk but don't want to spend too much money. If you just want the basics of a standing desk and aren't looking for any fancy features as a way to dip your toe in or not add any more electricity to your office space, this may be for you.Who shouldn't buy it:If you've ever tried to put together Ikea furniture you'd be surprised to see that this standing desk option is relatively easy to install, but I did need help screwing in some stubborn hardware. I ended up having to flip over the completed desk after finishing the setup, so if you think you may struggle to put this together alone and don't have help, you might have a hard time. Also, this desk doesn't have any electric raise or lower ability as it is handled by a hand crank. You'll need to be able to roll it up and down to the desired height.  ... Show more

SCORE
Pros
Quality look and feel
Handy USB hub for charging
Plenty of storage
Cons
Took an age to build
Why I like it:I haven't had much luck finding desks that could be called executive. To be an executive desk requires a product to feel expensive and add some class to the room it is in. Other desks I've tested for this category have fallen behind that mark, with some of them missing parts or looking cheap despite the price tag. Not the Ark ES from Eureka, though. The desk looks amazing and is incredibly sturdy. The standing part of the desk works well, with sensors to stop the desk from going down too far, and it even has a nice pop-up USB hub for charging your phone and tablet. Who is it for:All around, the Ark ES is one of the nicest desks I've used and is a great option for those looking at getting an L-shaped standing desk. If you're looking for something to give your home office some gravitas, this is the desk for you. It's also great for someone looking for an option that will last longer than just a few years.Who shouldn't buy it:While the desk looks beautiful once it's put together, it does take a lot of time to put together. Anyone who wants a quick build or a simple look to their desk should look elsewhere.  ... Show more

The best standing gaming desk money can buy
SecretLab Magnus Pro XL
9.1
/10
SCORE
Pros
Five height memories
Quiet motors
Good cable management
Cons
Multi-person assembly
Long assembly time
Heavy
Expensive
Why I like it:I have used a lot of desks throughout my career, but I can honestly say I've never used a desk quite like the Magnus Pro XL. It is at once the most industrial-looking table, while also giving off huge gamer energy. It has a five-setting standing system, and the motors are some of the quietest I've heard while testing. The motion is smooth, and even though the desk weighs quite a lot, it rises quickly and without hassle. I never thought of using a standing desk for gaming before, but it really helps to break up the hours of sitting.If gaming is your job and you need a large desk to help you, I cannot recommend the Magnus Pro XL enough.Who is it for:When gaming, you tend to have a lot of extra cables and extra monitors so you need a few extra features. If you can manage the cost of getting the extras, I would recommend it. The cable management is already excellent with the built-in power supply unit, as well as the large trench down the back, but the optional magnetic conduit lets you hide all of your wiring. I especially liked the PC mount that connects your gaming tower to the leg, making it rise with the table so your cables don't get stretched as the desk moves. Who shouldn't buy it:Measuring 70 inches long and made almost exclusively of metal parts, this desk is not meant for one-person assembly. Putting this desk together with just one person took two hours. If you don't have a way for someone to help you, you may want to consider another desk. Aside from this, the cost of this desk is my only sticking point. Fully loaded, it will set you back $1,700, although you could reduce that with fewer optional extras.

Branch Duo standing desk
8.8
/10
SCORE
Pros
Perfect for a smaller space
Easy to build
Stand notifications
Quality material
Simple controls
Cons
Doesn't work for multiple large monitors
Why I like it:The Branch Duo is the company's latest line of standing desks and uses a very simple control mechanism to set heights. The display is simple and clean, and all of the accessories just ooze quality. Building it was simple, taking me less than 30 minutes, and the size is perfect for smaller spaces. Who is it for:The Branch Duo is big enough for a couple of smaller monitors or one big one, with plenty of room on the top for a laptop. So if you have a smaller setup, it will fit your equipment perfectly. I especially like the notifications that you can set to remind you to stand or sit throughout the day. Standing desks are designed to help with your health, but they only work if you remember to do it, so if you're looking for that nudge but tend to forget on your own, this is designed to help you. If you'd like a desk with a keyboard tray, Branch has accessories that are compatible with the Duo.Who shouldn't buy it:Some setups have multiple monitors or need a lot of desktop space for other reasons. When you're looking to really fill a room and have space for a bigger setup, you'll want to look at another desk.  ... Show more

Uplift Standing Desk V2
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Lots of accessories
Lots of color choices
Cons
Legs are thinner than I like
Why I like it:Not only was this model easier to install than expected (I only needed a few tools, and Uplift includes accessories for no extra cost to organize all those pesky device cables), but it was by far the most customizable standing desk of the bunch. It also included a wireless foot switch accessory if I'd like to raise and lower the desk via a pedal at my feet (in addition to the keypad).I tested the 48- by 30-inch Uplift desk with a white frame and rubberwood desktop, complete with one cupholder grommet and one power grommet (the power grommet brings two outlets up to the desktop so you can more easily charge your phone or other handheld devices) and a paddle keypad that can be pressed up or down to raise/lower your desk. Overall it's an excellent, sturdy desk that seems durable enough to stand up to years of use.Who is it for:Desks can be a personal piece of furniture, created in your own vision. Those who love to add accessories and choose colors will appreciate the expansive options you have with the Uplift Standing desk. It gave me the basic options, including five desk sizes, a handful of frame colors (gray, dark gray, white or black) and over two dozen desktops, ranging from laminate (most affordable) to solid wood. From there, multiple additional accessories could be added, such as grommet covers that screw into either side of the desk for additional storage, outlets and more. There are also five different keypads to choose from in a black finish and three different keypad options in gray and white. Who shouldn't buy it:The one downside of this desk is the hefty price tag. While it isn't the most expensive desk on the list, it isn't exactly a budget pick. If you're not interested in any of the extras, this may not be a useful desk for you.  ... Show more

Branch Four Leg Standing Desk
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Quality materials
Sleek appearance
Easy assembly
Smooth and quiet movement
Cons
Two-person assembly
What I like:The Branch Four Leg Standing Desk is a great, lightweight, motorized standing desk that is made with quality materials. From the moment I got it out of the box and began putting it together, I could tell these parts would last. The touch screen is very quick to respond, making it easy to make small adjustments to the height, and it displays what height it is currently at, so seeing how much adjustment may be needed is easy. The memory can be set to three different heights.Many standing desks only have two legs, as that can tend to make for a smoother transition from sitting to standing height since there are less moving parts. However, this four-leg desk has no trouble with sturdy and stable movement.
Putting this together was a fairly quick job, taking only an hour for me to do alone, and it did come with all the tools I needed. Who is it for:This four-legged standing desk is a great fit for any home office and works for many needs. One of the top things I noticed is if you're looking for a desk for a more mobile setup for working from a laptop or a writing desk this can easily camouflage as a side table while you're not working. An added benefit to the desk is its very sleek, customizable appearance with two leg color and four desktop options.Who shouldn't buy it:I would recommend having someone help as it would probably cut the time in half and prove a little easier with the weight of the legs. I will note that you want to be sure to pay close attention to the instructions, as I easily got too ahead of myself and did some pieces backwards. This isn't a simple build, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll want a different desk.  ... Show more

What I like:When cable organization is the goal, the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 Pro is the desk. All of the cable management items, like a 3M cable organizer, cable management tray and magnetized cable runner, come included with the desk. With all the cables managed and out of the way, you have a lot of desktop space to play with. The SmartDesk 5 Pro is an electric motor desk that is quiet, quick and very easy to use and has three memory options. When you're choosing your heights and free-adjusting the desk it's important to watch where the cable tray organizer is in comparison to your PC if you keep it underneath, as a full-size tower will not fit underneath with how low the tray goes. However, this is generally shorter than most people will need the desk to be. For reference, I'm 5' 1" and I don't need it on the lowest setting for sitting. Building it took me about 1.5 hours by myself (this does include cable management time) and it was a little heavy to do alone, but it is possible. You'll just need to be careful.Who is it for:I love to have all my cords organized and largely out of sight, and if you are looking for good cable tray organizers on the standing desk you're looking for, the Autonomous SmartDesk 5 Pro may be for you. The cable tray organizer on the SmartDesk 5 hides all the unsightly cords you may get from the cabling of an electric desk and general PC setup and is easy to access with hand knobs and a hinge to open it. Inside the tray you also get a built-in power supply strip with three outlet plugs. In addition to the cable tray for organization, you also get a 3M cable organizer to stick onto the back of the desk to keep speaker, monitor, keyboard and mouse cables clean as well as a magnetized cable runner you attach to the back of the desk leg. The magnet is very strong and easy to stick on. It is big enough to hold both the desk cable and the power strip cord with room to spare. The rounded front edge is so comfortable for those who, like me, tend to lean on the front of the desk a lot.Who shouldn't buy it:The sensitivity of the anti-collision as you adjust height is a little bit stronger than most when it comes to preventing damage by lowering onto desk chair arms or other objects, but this could be seen as a benefit, as the desk protects the motor from damage by trying to push down through anything. However, if you plan to have a lot of things around the desk that might end up triggering this it may get in the way. I did find myself having to figure out what item was triggering it from time to time and I don't have much under my desk. If you're looking for the most responsive desk when it comes to releasing the buttons on the touch screen, I'd say this desk has a little bit of a delay compared to others on this list, but not an inconvenient delay.An item that is included is a pair of bag hooks that allow you to hang items underneath the desk, utilizing otherwise empty space. I was hoping to use these for my headphones but they weren't quite wide enough and I found myself knocking the hooks off regularly due to the short back end of the hook. If you saw this and were hoping for the same, you might want a desk or accessory more designed for that. When used for their intended purpose of hanging bags, they are a great hook size, but could still use a little more length in the back to keep it hooked to the desk.

SCORE
Pros
Rounded desktop edge
Desktop space
Mobility
Easy to adjust
Slim for simple storage
Cons
A little too heavy to carry back and forth
Stiff at first
What I like:In the case that you don't have a way to get a full standing desk, sometimes standing desk converters can be a great substitute. With the Branch Desk Riser, you get plenty of space and a comfortable edge to use while standing. It's lightweight but feels very sturdy and could easily be an option that is moved on and off the desk regularly. Initially, I was worried about the ease of getting the riser back down once it was up, however, after a few uses, this loosened up and was much easier to move back and forth. Adjusting the height is intuitive, and the riser is very responsive as soon as you release the handle. It can stop anywhere in between the maximum and minimum heights, so it will be just right for you. Best of all, no assembly required!Who is it for:While the size of the desk riser top makes it harder to carry around, it would be a great option for something to use at home or if you have a way to keep it somewhere in your office. It may not be a choice for something to carry to and from work, but it can be moved on and off the desk and into a stored area easily, thanks to its slim body. It's also a great choice if you're looking for something at a lower price point.Who shouldn't buy it:This riser is just big enough to hold a laptop with a little extra room around it, so it isn't going to add space or accommodate a big setup. If you truly want a full desk, the riser may not be enough of a fix for this problem.

Who should buy a standing desk?
Many people aren’t getting enough exercise or physical activity daily. We are spending more and more time working at our desks -- whether at home or in the office -- and this kind of sedentary lifestyle can be detrimental. Sitting for prolonged periods is linked to cardiovascular disease, obesity and other potential health risks. Scientists are still looking into exactly how much of a health difference standing positions can have against sitting, but standing desks can be quite a useful investment even if you won't stand at one eight hours a day.Avoiding working from your desk all day isn't always possible, but standing desks can help avoid the ill effects. Most standing desks have a stable desk frame that lets you adjust the height of your desk so you can choose to sit every now and then. If you have a desk lifestyle and want to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting, a standing desk may benefit you.
How I tested standing desks
To test each standing desk, I started by building each one and noting the ease or difficulty, including whether I needed help with any of the steps. Making the desk solo may be a make-or-break feature for some buyers. I selected desks of different sizes and styles to see if any had a better feel than the others and to make sure we tested for a variety of needs, like lots of desktop space or a desk that would fit well in small areas. Some are controlled manually, while others have electric motors for height adjustment. Either way, the ease of the lift was an important note since this is the draw of a standing desk. I spent a full day working at each one -- switching between sitting and standing -- making notes when something worked particularly well or caused a problem. Other products we tested
I tested the Seville Classics Airlift Height Adjustable Desk with Glass Top, the Seville Classics Airlift Pro S3 Electric Height Adjustable Standing Desk (no longer available), the Steelcase Solo Sit-To-Stand Desk and the Fezibo Height Adjustable Electric Standing Desk with Double Drawer, but they didn't make the cut. The Airlift with Glass Top came close to earning a spot above. It's a beautiful, sturdy desk at a midrange price. It also features a small center drawer for holding the basics. Unfortunately, its built-in touchscreen wasn't very responsive and the two USB-A ports, while theoretically a nice tech feature, are outdated for most of today's phones and tablets.The Airlift Pro S3 was a decent desk, but it was a little tougher to install than the others in its size range, and it had a cheaper-looking finish than the overall winner for best standing desk (the Vari desk).The Steelcase Solo desk was surprisingly simple to install for its size (the same as the Vari desk). Instead of using screws to install the legs, these simply lock into place. The desk is sturdy, looks nice and is quiet when raising and lowering. The Vari has a more sophisticated control panel and a nicer-looking finish and comes with desk accessories.The Fezibo model was intriguing to me because of its built-in storage, but I found this model more difficult to assemble than many of the others. Still, it's a reasonable option if you'd like storage compartments integrated into your desk and two levels: one for holding your monitor and the other for your keyboard and related accessories.As always, consider your specific needs before you buy a sit-stand desk. Do you have a lot of space and a higher budget? Consider the Vari or Uplift models. The Ikea model is a fantastic midsize manual desk at a great price. Regardless of your home setup, one of these models is bound to suit your needs. If you aren't sold on a standing desk, consider a standing desk converter for your existing desk instead. Factors to consider when buying a standing desk
As with any new piece of furniture, you'll want to take a little time to balance your needs with the space and budget you have for it.What is your budget?Prices range widely for standing desks, but you can find a great one to suit your needs at almost any budget. As noted above, the Ikea Trotten Standing Desk was my favorite option under $350.How much space do you have?Make sure you have enough space for your standing desk before you make your purchase. Don't just consider the room it's going in, either. Also think about the doors, stairwells and other places the box must pass through. It might fit in your planned office space, but if you can't get it up your third-floor walk-up, you'll be in trouble.How tall do you want to go?
CNETAll height-adjustable desks have a low and a high range for sitting and standing, but the height adjustment ranges aren't universal across different styles and brands. If you're on the shorter or taller end, certain models might not be comfortable for you, so check the specs beforehand to determine if you'll be comfortable using the desk, both sitting and standing.Electric or manual?An electric standing desk will cost more than a manual standing desk, so your budget will absolutely come into play here, but there's more to consider. Manual desks, which have pneumatic pedals, hand cranks or other manual controls, are lighter and quieter because there's no heavy, noise-making motor mounted under your desk. Manual desks also don't require proximity to an outlet to work. Electric standing desks allow for easy raising and lowering with the press of a button. Some even have digital height readouts so that you can always return your desk to the exact same sitting or standing height settings.
Standing Desk FAQs
How tall should your standing desk be?
The specific height of your standing desk largely depends on your own height. If you're a shorter individual, you'll want to make sure it can adjust to a low standing height, and for taller people, you'll want it to be able to go higher. One of the biggest things we learned when switching to a standing desk is that ideally, the desk will sit where your elbows can rest comfortably at a 90-degree angle and your monitor is directly in front of your face so you're not straining your neck. This will have the least amount of wear and tear on your body while standing.
What are different types of standing desks?
Our best list focuses on two main types of standing desks, electric and manual sit-stand desks, there are also standing desk converters and fixed-standing desks. The desks on our list are either lifted via electric or manual means and can change height to fit either a seated or standing position, a standing desk converter is a stand you put on top of a seated desk to bring your monitors or laptop up higher, adding height to your mouse and screen without actually moving your desk. The fixed-standing desks don't have the option to lower them to a seated height.
Are standing desks worth it?
If you're looking to lose weight, a standing desk alone may not help. Where the benefits do come in is by decreasing the amount of time your body is sedentary and improving your productivity. It's especially helpful for those who feel like sitting at their desk all day gives them neck and/or back pain. When struggling with these issues, you may find that a standing desk is very worth the cost.Something to keep in mind with a standing desk is that standing for long periods can wear on the feet and legs as you get used to it. You'll want to be sure you're switching to sitting every once in a while to prevent this fatigue and be mindful of the shoes you choose to wear for the day.
How long will a standing desk last?
The length of time you can expect to get out of a desk depends on a few things -- quality, warranty and usage. A desk that's made of higher quality material will last much longer. When you have a desk with a longer warranty, you know you'll be able to get more years out of the desk. As with anything, the more the desk is moved up and down, the more wear the desk will have which may lessen the amount of time you get out of it. On average, you typically see a good-standing desk last around five to 10 years.
What are the benefits of using a standing desk?
A 2021 study has shown that people who worked at a standing desk were found to be more productive, healthier and less sedentary. This included a decrease in neck, shoulder and back pain as well as improved mood.
Do I have to have my standing desk near a plug socket?
The proximity needed to a plug socket for your standing desk depends on your electronic setup as well as whether your desk is electric or has technical components like wireless chargers. If you have an electric lift desk, you will want it to be close enough to plug in so you can switch it from sitting to standing as the motors won't work without power. Those with a desktop computer will also want to be close to a plug so you can power your computer without cords trailing across the office.If you have a well-charged laptop or don't plan to use a computer at your desk and you choose a manual standing desk with no electronics on top, then you wouldn't necessarily have to have your desk near a plug socket.
Are standing desks adjustable?
There are fixed standing desks that are a certain height and don't move up or down, but the standing desks I recommend are all adjustable. The electric ones lower and raise at the push of a button, some even having memory settings for several different heights, while the manual ones have a crank or other mechanism you move to raise or lower the desktop. You'll want to check the minimum and maximum height on each desk, as they will all be different, to ensure it will be comfortable for your sitting and standing height.
What is the maximum weight capacity of a standing desk?
The weight capacity of a standing desk will increase with heavier-duty materials for both the desktop and the frame, as well as the motors for electric desks. Typically, dual motor vs single motor desks will have a higher weight capacity, as will desks made of steel as opposed to aluminum. The Uplift Standing Desk V2 on my list carries the most at 355 lbs with its steel frame and dual motors, one for each leg of the frame.
Are standing desks easy to assemble?
As with any desk, some are easier to assemble than others. Those with storage tend to have a few more pieces and would be easier to assemble with multiple people. Some are a more simple and light design, easy to put together on your own. My top pick, the Branch Standing Desk, only took about 30 minutes to put together alone.
