Dehumidifier FAQs
If you experience high humidity levels, which can increase during the spring and summer months, then it can lead to issues like mold growth, which is not great for your health (it can lead to death) and also leads to further property damage. This is when a dehumidifier comes in, as they absorb moisture and improve the air quality in the home, especially during more humid months.Where areas lack proper air circulation, high humidity and potential problems are a risk. That's why using a dehumidifier's capacity to handle damp indoor spaces such as bathrooms, laundry rooms and basements is a smart move.Our CNET experts have identified the top six dehumidifiers of 2025 to help reduce humidity levels in your home. Whether you need a portable model, a larger unit for a big room or basement or an energy-efficient option, we have choices to fit every need and budget. Best dehumidifiers of 2025

Pros
Remote access
Cons
Slightly bulky
Since dehumidifiers mainly rely on refrigeration technology to pull humidity out of the air in your home, it should be no surprise that a company known for refrigerators tops this list. This 50-pint, large-capacity model offers a helpful smart capability that allows you to connect the machine to Wi-Fi and monitor the fullness of the collection tank remotely. Plus, it will turn off on its own when it’s full so there’s no need to worry about coming home to a mess, and it offers a continuous draining option, too. Another benefit of this machine is the washable filter, so you don’t need to consistently replace it. Depending on your size, budget and functionality needs, Frigidaire is always a steady choice. Most high-functioning dehumidifiers aren't winning any points for style, but this Frigidaire model has a clean, unobtrusive look. Reviewers online frequently noted a quick, drastic improvement of the humidity levels in the rooms where this was placed.  ... Show more

Pros
Largest reach
This hOmeLabs dehumidifier purports to be able to manage the largest square footage among various models, perfect for managing an open-plan, damp basement or other large space with excess moisture. According to Energy Star, it's also one of the most energy-efficient options for dehumidifiers, which can save you money. Among its many benefits, this dehumidifier can also remove up to 22 pints, or 1.2 gallons, of moisture from the air each day, ensuring a humid-free home. It also features wheels and a handle for ease of moving, and it has a timer. Customers on Amazon frequently remarked that the dehumidifier was exceptionally quiet and was easy to assemble and use.

Pros
Affordable

Cons
Smaller capacity
If you live with humid summers, an easy way to cut down on your monthly energy bill is to run a dehumidifier and fan in your bedroom rather than rely on central air conditioning to cool every unoccupied room in your house overnight. For bedroom needs, you probably require less power and reach, but the noise level of the unit becomes a bigger concern. This Midea model has one of the lowest decibels available, with user reviews reporting it was no louder than an average fan and emits none of the vibrating or shuddering noises that some models can make. Midea also had a strong showing among various review sites overall, with several models being designated best compact, best budget or quietest dehumidifier.In addition to the quietness of the machine, it has Wi-Fi and voice control capabilities, two drainage options and an automatic restart function that goes into effect if your power goes out. It can dehumidify up to 22 pints per day, which is equivalent to more than three gallons.  ...

Less powerful
A solid dehumidifier that can run continuously for many hours without needing its tank drained is typically going to run you at least $150. If you're not ready for that kind of investment or want to test the waters -- pun intended -- in a small space and on a smaller budget, this miniature model could be perfect for you.Highly portable and low on energy draw, the reservoir can only collect 13 ounces at once, so it is best for use in small spaces, such as bathrooms or closets for a short amount of time. A small, inexpensive model such as this one could also be good to help you determine whether you need a more powerful dehumidifier to make a positive effect on your home environment and humidity.

Our list of best dehumidifiers was aggregated from numerous review sites among models that had the most inclusions, as well as best-selling and top-rated models at major retailers such as Amazon, Home Depot and Lowe's. Only dehumidifiers that were Energy Star certified were considered for inclusion. We researched the dehumidifiers on this list by analyzing specs and user reviews, diving deep for mentions of persistent issues, and considering the available features and functionality compared with price as a measure of each model's overall value. We also focused primarily on those models that had high user ratings. While these were not tested in person in a lab environment, every dehumidifier on this list has been tested by numerous sites for high performance, including Consumer Reports and Best Reviews Guide. Additionally, we were able to examine several in person in order to get a feel for their footprint, design and control panel.Dehumidifiers compared

Dehumidifier buying guide
Types of dehumidifiers
Some dehumidifiers are built with the option for a hose attachment. Chris Monroe/CNETDehumidifiers typically work via condensation or desiccants, with condensation models being the most common and most effective. Among condensation dehumidifiers, some smaller units can only be drained manually, where the reservoir tank must be removed and emptied periodically. (Most dehumidifiers will shut off when their reservoir becomes full.) Many larger units are also built with the option for a drain hose attachment, where the dehumidifier can drain continuously through the hose directed to a sink or floor drain. While this primarily relies on gravity, some units also include a drain pump so that condensation can be directed upward to a sink for frequent emptying and draining. Dehumidifier size and volume
When choosing a dehumidifier, finding the right size for your space is critical.  SereneLifeMost dehumidifiers are classified according to their reach, the square footage you can expect to dehumidify, as well as their volume, usually measured in how many pints of water per day it can pull from the air. The typical reach for average floor model dehumidifiers is between 1,500 and 4,500 square feet, with the capacity usually between 20 and 70 pints of water per day. However, this capacity does not necessarily indicate the volume of a given model's reservoir. In order for the dehumidifier to pull the maximum number of pints per day from the air, the unit must be allowed to continuously drain via a hose, or the reservoir must be drained manually as often as necessary.As for the size of the dehumidifier itself, if you're trying to dehumidify an average size room in your home, (i.e. not a closet or bathroom,) dehumidifiers are typically going to be placed on the floor, and have a relatively large footprint. Those on this list are, on average, about 12 inches deep by 15 inches wide, with a height of about 24 inches. There are smaller units available that can sit on a counter, dresser or desktop, but those will typically only be effective for dehumidifying small, enclosed spaces and have a significantly smaller capacity for collecting condensation. Dehumidifier features
Dehumidifiers have a wide variety of controls, including sleep timers, custom humidity settings and multiple speeds. Chris Monroe/CNETIn addition to reach and capacity, you may want to consider a number of other features when shopping for a dehumidifier. Certain models have smart-enabled capabilities, meaning you can monitor and control them remotely when they are connected to your home Wi-Fi. Models with pumps allow you to drain the water upward into a sink without relying on gravity. A defrost function might be an attractive feature if you are running your dehumidifier in a damp and cold environment. Dehumidifiers can also have a wide variety of controls, including sleep timers, custom humidity settings and multiple speeds. What to know about past humidifier recalls
In 2023, roughly 1.5 million dehumidifiers were recalled due to fire hazards after there were nearly two dozen reported fires in connection with the dehumidifiers, according to the US Consumer Product and Safety Commission. The dehumidifiers recalled were from numerous brands, including Kenmore, GE, SoleusAir, Norpole and Seabreeze. The CPSC said at the time that the dehumidifiers could “overheat, smoke, and catch fire, posing fire and burn hazards to consumers.”All of the dehumidifiers apart from the recall were manufactured by Gree Electric Appliances, Inc. of Zhuhai. The difference between humidifiers and dehumidifiers
While the answer may seem simple to you, these two appliances can often be confused. While a dehumidifier removes excess moisture from the air, a humidifier adds it back in.If your home is too dry, you may need a humidifier. If it is damp or humid, a dehumidifier is your best bet. But sometimes, you may need both -- the humidifier for your bedroom or living room and the dehumidifier in basements or rooms that are affected by humidity throughout the year. Maintaining the perfect amount of humidity in your home may seem like a balancing act, but it is well worth it in the end. Dehumidifier FAQs
How do I know if I need a dehumidifier?
A dehumidifier might be a worthy investment if certain rooms in your house feel uncomfortably humid, or if they smell dank or musty. Certainly, if you live in a humid climate, even seasonally, or don't have a central air conditioning unit, a dehumidifier can make your home more comfortable. While a fan simply moves air around the room, a dehumidifier actually removes the humidity from the air. According to the Mayo Clinic, a relative humidity level between 30% and 50% is ideal for both health and comfort, and air that is too humid can affect both your respiratory system and your skin. (Mayo Clinic is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) A hygrometer is a simple, inexpensive device that can measure the actual humidity in your home, to make yourself aware of whether any adjustment is needed.
Show more
How do dehumidifiers work?
The most common is by a system of refrigeration and condensation. Humid air is pulled into the unit where it is cooled to the point of condensation, which is then collected in a reservoir that must be either periodically emptied manually or can be ferried into a nearby drain via a pump and hose. Some dehumidifiers work via desiccants, where certain substances such as activated charcoal, silica gel or calcium chloride, which are effective at absorbing moisture from the air.
Show more
How effective is a dehumidifier?
The effectiveness of a given dehumidifier depends on many factors, including the size of the space you're trying to dehumidify, whether it's open or enclosed, the power and reach of the particular dehumidifier you're working with and the initial humidity of the space you're trying to treat. If you're trying to dehumidify a large space with a model that is not equipped for such a space, you will likely have disappointing results, but if you use and maintain an appropriate dehumidifier for your room size and condition, you should easily notice a marked improvement in the air quality.
Show more
Where should you put a dehumidifier?
The best place to put a dehumidifier is as centrally located as possible within the space you are trying to dehumidify, without it being cumbersome or dangerous to move around. Because dehumidifiers rely on air circulation, you want to avoid placing it against a wall or a piece of furniture where airflow is compromised or its vents may be blocked. If you're using a hose for continuous draining, you'll also have to factor in the need to run the hose to an appropriate sink or drain.
Show more
Are dehumidifiers energy efficient?
Not all dehumidifiers are energy efficient, but it's important to look for Energy Star certification if you are going to run it continuously or for long periods of time to treat the air in your home.
