How we test showerheads
From easy-to-install filtered showerheads to those offering multiple spray settings, there are a ton of options out there. Which is why our experts tested the best on offer, from rain showerheads that offer full body coverage to handheld heads with detachable hoses and high-pressure streams, to help you find the right one to add to your bathroom. Say goodbye to your boring old showerhead and level up your shower experience with one of these top options. Read more: Best Showerhead Filters of 2025What's the best showerhead overall?Overall, the High Sierra Classic Plus is the showerhead that came up on top as the best to elevate your bathroom experience. We liked its easy and noninvasive install, which is especially important if you're in a rented apartment. The price-to-value ratio is strong at only $47 retail. We also liked its water efficiency, elegant design and its wide and firm water pattern. Best showerheads for 2025

Best showerhead overall
High Sierra Classic Plus
Pros
Powerful, even with low water pressure or hard water
Simple and elegant design
Affordable
Cons
Doesn't offer alternate spray patterns
The affordable High Sierra Classic Plus showerhead gets all of the basics right. It has a wide coverage spray with plenty of firmness. I tend to like a relaxing stream on my body and a firm spray on my face and hair. The Classic Plus doesn't offer any alternate spray pattern settings, but the main one balances both of those needs well. If you tend to find a good default and stick with it, look no further. The Classic Plus has a simple and elegant design. It's one of the most affordable showerheads on this list and conserves water as well with a 1.5 gpm rating. If you're looking for something fancy with a wide variety of settings, I have plenty of alternate options below, but this is the Amazon Echo Dot of showerheads. It's simple, affordable and elegant. It's also powerful, even with low water pressure or hard water. If you don't care about extras and just want something to get the job done well, go with the water-saving High Sierra Classic Plus. Available in brushed nickel, bronze, polished brass, matte black or a chrome finish.  ... Show more

Best showerhead features
AquaDance 7-inch Premium Rainfall Combo
Pros
Dual heads allow for multiple spray types
Loved the massage setting
Useful features include the ability to pause either stream
Cons
Using both showerheads results in lower pressure
Thinner stream than some models on our list
The AquaDance 7-inch Premium showerhead is a great choice if you're looking for a dual showerhead with a lot of features. It includes a handheld showerhead with a stainless steel shower hose and spray head that sit in place behind the main showerhead. Both offer six spray settings, including a full-coverage spray setting, an intense massage setting, one that mixes those two, and a mist. The full coverage setting on both the main shower and the handheld showerhead feels great. It balances firmness with wide coverage and still feels relaxing. The intense massage provided a great way to mix it up when I wanted to really feel the pressure and water flow. I ended up leaving the main rain setting on full coverage and kept the hand shower on the massage setting if I wanted that extra intensity.You can use the pause feature to stop the stream if you want to save water while you suds up. You can run both showerheads simultaneously on the same or different spray settings. You'll lose some water pressure with the dual shower setting, so you could just as easily switch back and forth from the main showerhead to the handheld shower. You can switch settings by turning a dial, or you can use the splitter to easily swap between the main showerhead and the handheld showerhead. Whatever you want your shower to feel like -- regular showerhead, handheld shower or dual shower -- this AquaDance has an option for you. If you're the type that likes options and likes to change spray settings based on your mood, this is the best showerhead for you.  ... Show more

Best premium-model showerhead
Moen S6320
Pros
Excellent balance of coverage and pressure
Smart and useful settings, including a wide-spray massage
Beautiful design
Cons
Expensive
Not ideal for those who desire a high-pressure spray
The Moen S6320 looks like a high-end shower with its 8-inch diameter and polished chrome finish. The main full-coverage setting again strikes the right balance between relaxing coverage and firmness. Plus, the S6320 switches to an intense massage setting that also feels great. Many of the massage settings I tested were too narrow to be useful outside of spot-cleaning. Moen's is still wide enough to provide actual coverage while providing a nice intensity boost. You can also switch back and forth easily with a handle on the side of the showerhead. It's simple enough to control that I was able to find it and switch the setting while my eyes were closed after suds-ing my face. If you want a showerhead that looks higher-end while still maintaining a simple elegance, the Moen S6320 fits the bill. It doesn't have a lot of features, but the two settings are both awesome and switching between them is so easy that you can do it with your eyes closed -- literally.  ... Show more

Best rain showerhead
American Standard Spectra eTouch
Pros
Economical with water
Includes remote control
Cons
Mist and massage sprays are narrow
Rainfall setting on the gentle side
Expensive
Showering with the American Standard Spectra eTouch rain showerhead genuinely feels like standing under a gentle stream or outside during a warm summer rain. This bathroom accessory is super relaxing. The Spectra eTouch is pretty expensive for the brushed nickel or chrome finish, but it's economical with water at a 1.8gpm rating. The Spectra includes a remote you can attach to your shower wall to switch between four spray modes or simply touch the showerhead's rim to do the same. It feels high-tech without adding any complexity. The different settings include a fine mist and two varieties of an intense massage spray, although I found both too narrow to provide any coverage. The rainfall shower setting was also too gentle on my face, so the Spectra doesn't have a single setting that perfectly balances a firm feel and full coverage.  ... Show more

Best showerhead for your smart home
Kohler Moxie Showerhead
Pros
Showerhead that doubles as a Bluetooth speaker
Waterproof speaker can be pulled free from the showerhead and used in other spaces
Cons
Actual showerhead is just OK
No alternate spray modes
No voice control for temperature or pressure
The Kohler Moxie combines a Bluetooth speaker with Amazon's assistant Alexa built-in and an otherwise ordinary showerhead. You can't control the water or temperature with your voice or an app, so I hesitate to call it a smart shower, but it's the closest to one on this list and much more attainable than the fully smart Moen shower, which requires a plumbing overhaul to install.The battery-powered speaker nests in the center of the showerhead with magnets, so you can easily pull it free and use it as a smart speaker in other rooms of your house. Thanks to Alexa, you can listen to music or issue a wide variety of voice commands. The speaker itself surprised me with its sound quality and it genuinely made my morning routines more fun. The showerhead itself is less impressive. The stream was intense but a little narrow, and it didn't have any alternate spray modes. It comes in a variety of finishes, at either 2.5 or 1.75 gpm.  ...

Other showerheads we tested
Honorable mentionsKohler Forte 22169: Kohler's showerhead provides good coverage. The main setting strikes the necessary balance between feeling firm and still relaxing. You can easily switch to a concentrated massage mode or a fine mist. Overall, it's a solid, well-balanced fixed showerhead option that you should consider if you like the look or the brand. It even saves water with a 1.75 gpm rating. It simply didn't stand out as much as the ones above and the concentrated massage stream is too narrow to be useful.
Delta In2ition Two-in-One: This Delta showerhead features a clever adjustable showerhead design in which a handheld shower is nested within the main showerhead. The main shower provides the full coverage option, and the handheld shower offers a more intense stream. You can also run both the main and handheld shower at once, though the water pressure expectedly dips a bit, and I'm not a fan of low water pressure. The handheld showerhead easily pulls free, or you can leave the shower arm in place for a stationary massage stream. All of the settings are functional but the main coverage option is a little too weak for my tastes. The main showerhead is also a little hard to pivot, but that's a minor nitpick. This is a competent shower that's worth your consideration, but the little drawbacks took away just enough to prevent it from ranking higher for me.
Not recommended
Speakman S-2252-E175: None of the showers I tested were outright bad, but this model from Speakman doesn't have a strong enough stream for my tastes. The main mode is fine if underwhelming. The alternate nozzle setting effectively just lets the water pour straight out without any added water pressure or water flow at all. Overall, it was a low-water-pressure shower experience.
Culligan WSH-C125: This affordable model from Culligan includes a shower filter and has a bunch of different settings. Changing between the nozzle settings is a pain. The main shower works well enough, but none of the alternate modes are inspiring. Again, this is a competent bathroom shower, but you have plenty of better options.
Delta's clever showerhead tucks a handheld into the main body.  Andrew Gebhart/CNET Factors to consider when buying a showerhead
The price, finish and materials can vary wildly, and you can also look for the best showerheads with a lower gallons-per-minute rating if water conservation is a concern. You can get a fixed showerhead, which is attached to the wall, or one that includes a handheld sprayer. Some showerheads offer a wide variety of spray patterns (you don't have to be limited to rainfall if you want to switch your spray setting). Whether it's a handheld, dual, fixed, low-flow, high-pressure, combination or rainfall, your showerhead must have the essentials for hassle-free bathing: faucet, flow restrictor, filter, flexible hose and swivel ball.Mount type: Depending on your shower setup, you'll want to choose either a wall or ceiling-mounted showerheadSettings and features: Some showerheads offer multiple settings for different stream types and pressure levels including pulsing massage, rainfall and wide-spray.You can even score a showerhead with a built-in speaker for listening to music and podcasts while you wash up. Feature-heavy showerheads typically cost more so consider what your needs are beforehand.Finish: You'll likely want your showerhead to match or at least complement the other metal accents in your shower. Showerheads are available in loads of styles and finishes, including chrome, nickel, copper, bronze and black.Cost: Showerheads start at about $25 and go well into the hundreds of dollars. Settle on a price range before you start narrowing your search. How we test showerheads
I've taken a lot of showers over the past couple of weeks. When testing a showerhead system, I look at a lot of factors: The diameter of the face, the gallons-per-minute output, the number of settings, the materials, the design and more. We also run an anecdotal test on the water flow rate, water pressure and power of the spray pattern with dried egg yolk. More than anything, I showered and noted how each shower experience felt.
Some settings did a better job of removing eggs than others.  Andrew GebhartI leave each model installed for a couple of days so I can take a variety of showers. During the first shower with a new shower system, I'm paying close attention to each spray pattern and how they feel, but I also want to shower when I'm not thinking about it as much. With each model, I shower when I'm groggy in the morning and do a post-workout shower to cool down.
After every shower, I take notes on the shower experience. Was it firm, relaxing or both? Was the showering experience intense enough to get the soap and shampoo off quickly or did I have to change settings? Is it easy to change settings?
For the egg test, I brushed egg yolk onto a cutting board and let it dry for 24 hours. Then I held the board 20 inches from the showerhead while it ran for 10 seconds and noted how much yolk was removed. I ran this test for each setting on each showerhead. Most only removed a little yolk if any, but a few settings proved weaker or stronger relative to the rest.
Different showers check different boxes, but at the end of the day, what mattered most to me was the actual showering experience. None of the models I tested were terrible, but a few rose above the rest and cleaned up the competition.
Showerhead FAQs
What does a showerhead's gmp mean?
A showerhead's gallons per minute is the common way to measure a unit's pressure. Most showerheads range somewhere between 1.25 and 2.5 gmp. The higher the gpm, the more pressure your showerhead will be capable of.
Can you install a showerhead yourself?
Most showerheads do not require the expertise of a plumber or handyman to install. With simple tools such as a wrench or screwdriver and a stepladder. You may also need thread tape but that is commonly provided alongside the showerhead with purchase.
Do showerheads have filters?
Most showerheads don't have filters but you can purchase specialty showerheads to filter out impurities in your water such as chlorine and scale.
Will any showerheads fit in my showers?
Most wall-mount and ceiling-mount showerheads share a universal connection. You shouldn't have to worry about matching the showerhead to your specific shower unless you are dealing with an unusual design or looking to change the type of mount from your existing one.
