It's important to consider the type of dad you have when it comes to finding the right Father's Day gift. If your dear old dad is the kind of dude who loves to build and fix things (sometimes even when they're not broken!), he'll appreciate a present that speaks to his love of tinkering. To improve his DIY projects, here's our list of tools, accessories and gadgets that will make his big ideas a reality. It includes things like a telescoping magnetic tool set for the Pops who is constantly dropping small things, personalized coveralls to protect his "good" jeans and tasty hot sauce for dads who do their handy work in the kitchen. While you're at it, don't forget to get in touch and let your dear old dad know how much he means to you. He'll love that too! Father's Day gifts under $25
Blackstone breakfast grill tool set Breakfast just got way better. If Dad's into cooking breakfast (especially on the flat top), this set will be a hit. It comes with a batter dispenser for perfect pancakes, a bacon press and two egg rings for "egg-cellent" round eggs every time. (You know he'll use that dad joke, too.) It'll be the gift that keeps on giving every Sunday morning.

Telescoping magnetic tool set If your dad is anything like mine, then you've heard him complain about dropping (then losing) screws or nails throughout every project he's ever done. But if he owned this telescoping magnetic tool set, you'd be hearing tales of victorious recovery efforts instead. The set comes with the following extendable tools: 1-pound pickup tool, 5-pound pickup tool, two different mirrors and a flashlight. It's practically impossible to lose even the smallest objects with these nifty gadgets. There's also a handy portable tool bag to house them all.

'Measure twice cut onc' builders pencil Every DIYer needs a good pencil; for most tradespeople, a square pencil is the way to go. The wide flat edges keep it from rolling off uneven surfaces, and they make it easier to get a close mark on a wall or when drawing a line from a level. These particular pencils have the classic saying "Measure twice, cut once" on them, something most of us fail to do -- so instead, the pencil has the last "E" cut off. It's a great joke that had my dad, who I bought them for, belly laughing for hours.

Aluminum rafter square and set square When it comes to building furniture or shelves, angles matter. When you need to make straight cuts to make something flush, you need to use a tool that will give you the exact angle you need. This set comes with a traditional set square to help with right angles and a rafter square that lets you draw out perpendicular lines, scribe different angles and check if something is a perfect right angle. Eventually, DIY dad will have a bunch of these but for now, this set is a great place to start.

Red Clay hot sauce variety pack If the dad in your life prefers his projects to take place in the kitchen, he'll be smitten with this "whole shebang" variety pack of hot sauces from Red Clay. It includes everything he needs to add amazing flavor to meals and beverages too: two hot sauces (Original and Carolina), Spicy Peach Honey (add it to ice cream!), Spicy Margarita Salt and Spicy Everything Salt. You'll earn extra points for recommending he add Spicy Everything Salt and a dash of Carolina hot sauce to his next breakfast sandwich.

VTech Drill and Learn toolbox If the DIY dad in your life has some young apprentices, snag him this fun VTech tool set so he can instill his craft in his kiddos (or grandkids!). He'll love being the foreman of these projects -- and other adults can appreciate the low-risk nature of this kit. There will be no holes in walls or chairs with missing legs, thankfully. The toddler-friendly set comes with a working spinning drill, hammer, wrench, screws and nails for endless fun.
$30 at Amazon

Waxed canvas and leather tool pouch The DIY-obsessed dad in your life probably already has at least half of the garage dedicated to various tool storage and organization, but what about when he's on the go? This Olpr Leather Goods Co. tool pouch has plenty of pockets and loops for the tools Dad needs to carry with him on his tool belt, plus it's sleek and can be personalized with his initials. Whether Dad is into fishing, gardening, DIY projects or just can't stand to be too far away from his trusty hammer, he'll love this accessory.

Roxon KS2 mini multitool Compact multitools tend to sacrifice quality for size and cost, but Roxon is the exception that proves the rule. You wouldn't know by looking at it, but this kit includes 13 different tools, including a stainless steel knife, a surprisingly large pair of scissors and a mean little saw blade. The G10 handle means it has some good grip to it, and there's an upgraded model with D2 steel if you're willing to pay a little more. This is an excellent little multitool, and the price makes it the perfect Father's Day gift for just about anyone.
$38 at Amazon

Misc
Portable flood light If your dad is the kind of guy who's always tinkering late at night, chances are he could really use some extra lighting. This portable, rechargeable flood light has five brightness modes, a magnetic base, a hanging hook and only weighs a little over a pound. It's great for all sorts of home projects and would even be useful for camping, fishing or any other activities Dad is into.
$33 at Amazon

Personalized 12-in-1 hammer multitool This is the kind of gift for the father who is always ready to fix something at a moment's notice. This multitool includes a hammer, nail puller, plier and wire cutter. If your dad needs to do anything around the house, he can whip this out and fix just about anything. To make this gift even more special, you can engrave it with a personalized message.
$32 at Etsy

Ryobi Link toolbox As DIY dads move on in the hobby they will accumulate more and more "stuff." Nails, screws of various lengths, drill bits and all the small parts that make up an effective toolkit require a home, and that's where Ryobi Link comes in. Because these toolboxes are modular, you can start out small and buy them this base model. Then as they get more tools and more accessories, you can build on it until you have a full storage solution. You can even attach these to the wall using the Ryobi wall mounts.
$40 at The Home Depot

FosPower emergency weather radio Being in the rugged outdoors can be fun, but it's even better when you're prepared. This emergency weather radio will give him everything needed to help withstand anything. It has a rechargeable battery, and he can power it in five ways: with AAA batteries, a hand crank, a 2,000-mAh power bank, a Micro-USB port and a solar panel. It also has a bright flashlight, weather broadcasts and an SOS alarm.

Lego retro radio Upon first glance, this looks like a funky retro transistor radio. But it's made of Lego! If the dad in your life is a fan of the '70s, music and building things with a zillion tiny pieces, this gift is a no-brainer. While it doesn't actually play music, it does play an era-correct crackle noise and music snippets. The recipient can also connect their smartphone via the back panel and at least pretend it's playing through the radio. If nothing else, it makes for great decor and a fun conversation piece.

Personalized coveralls Are you tired of seeing your dad wear the same grease-stained clothes all the time? Then these personalized overalls are just the thing for the guy who loves working on cars or generally getting filthy while working on projects. They are great for protecting clothing and also have plenty of pockets (even a leg pocket!) for useful tools. They can be customized with up to three lines of text (18 characters per line) and come in regular or tall lengths for sizes medium to XXL.
$70 at Etsy

3M worktunes connect hearing protector When your dad is working with heavy machinery and needs something to protect his ears, he'll thank you for these ear protectors from 3M. These have Bluetooth technology that connects to a phone or any Bluetooth-enabled device. There is an integrated microphone for hands-free calls and even an AM/FM radio so your dad can jam out to his favorite stations while having his ears protected up to 24 decibels.

DeWalt drive 108-piece mechanic's tool set Is your dad in need of new tools? This 108-piece DeWalt chrome mechanic's tool set is a great one that has a removable power tools accessory case. Tools include hex keys, nut drivers, ratchets, a socket extender and much, much more.
