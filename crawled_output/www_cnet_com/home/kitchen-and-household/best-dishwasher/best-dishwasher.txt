Despite having a dishwasher in the house as a kid, we rarely used it beyond cleaning up after large dinners. Only as an adult did I discover how much easier it was than washing everything by hand. Dishwashers also use a lot less energy and water than you'd think, so swapping out an older unit can help whittle down your utility bills. Our Picks

Dishwasher buying guide: Things to consider
We dove deep into dishwashers to find the best models to buy in 2025. Kseniya Ovchinnikova/GettyThe residential built-in dishwasher market ranges from $360 budget products with basic features to $3,700 luxury units. Still, most homeowners will likely find the best balance of performance, features, energy efficiency and price in models costing between $800 and $1,200.To build this comparison, I evaluated 483 unique dishwasher models from 42 brands, ultimately narrowing the list to 12 models that showcase what major brands like Bosch, Miele, Frigidaire, Samsung, GE and KitchenAid have to offer. Instead of hands-on testing, which isn't possible at this time, I buried myself in an extensive data analysis of dishwasher features, customer ratings and Energy Star info that took over a week to complete.What is the best dishwasher overall?After deep research, visiting appliance showrooms, speaking with industry experts and bingeing on enough dishwasher data to turn my brain into goo, everything points to the Bosch 300 Series SGE53C55UC as the best dishwasher for most people. Let's see how it compares to the competition.
Bosch
Photo Gallery 1/1
Bosch
Best dishwasher overall
Bosch 300 Series SGE53C55UC
Pros
Low water use at just 2.6 gallons per cycle
Adjustable 9-position upper rack to help accommodate large pots on the lower rack
Broad range of models for every budget
Cons
Short 1-year warranty
Fits fewer place settings than the Miele and Samsung dishwasher models on this list
Shortest possible cycle is 1 hour and 40 minutes
What we like:At around $1,000, the Bosch SGE53C55UC falls close to the average cost for a residential built-in dishwasher. While its low electricity usage qualifies it for an Energy Star rating, Bosch uses just 2.6 gallons of water per normal wash cycle, the lowest among our other top picks. You can adjust the upper rack to fit large items below—or make room for bigger plates above. It holds only 13 place settings, which is less than the Samsung and Miele models in our top picks.Who is it for:As a brand, Bosch's biggest strength is its outstanding selection of models for every budget, from $550 to $1,800. Bosch is also massively popular in online customer reviews, with a median rating of 4.5 stars, which is the highest in this comparison behind Maytag. Unlike the average Maytag dishwasher, most Bosch models qualify for Energy Star certifications. Many Bosch dishwashers support smart home integrations with Amazon Alexa, Google Home and IFTTT—giving them more compatibility with existing systems than most brands. Still, it lags behind Samsung's excellent SmartThings integration.Who should avoid it:My main beef with Bosch is the short 1-year warranty, though this is sadly all-too-common among large appliances, despite customers expecting decades of use. Bosch does well enough for durability, coming in third place in J.D. Power's 2024 appliance satisfaction study, behind KitchenAid and Samsung. Like most dishwashers, Bosch SGE53C55UC's fastest wash cycles still take over 90 minutes to complete, though still more convenient and efficient than washing dirty dishes by hand. Overall, Bosch has a solid reputation for quality at different budgets—the kind of flexibility that defines the best dishwashers for most people.  ... Show more

Meile
Best energy-efficient dishwasher
Miele G 7216 SCU
Pros
Door automatically opens after drying
Flexible racking system supports up to 16 place settings
More Energy Star Most Efficient rated models than any other brand
Cons
Must buy in-store from a dealer
Online reviews are scarce
Surprisingly short 2-year warranty for a luxury product
What we like:The Miele G 7216 SCU may be one of the luxury brand's entry-level models, but it comes with two helpful convenience features: an auto-open door and a flexible racking system. Auto-open dishwashers improve airflow and the drying experience, plus you'll always know when the wash cycle is complete. The three racks come with markers to show you which attachments are adjustable. The G 7216 SCU is also very quiet at 42 dBa, though some Miele dishwasher models register just 39 dBa, slightly behind Samsung.Who is it for:Those seeking an energy-efficient machine with premium features. In my research, Miele was the most energy-efficient brand overall, with 20 models qualifying for the Energy Star Most Efficient certification, which is a step above the normal Energy Star rating. There's also a built-in water softener that helps with maintenance and performance in areas with hard water. Even though Miele says to have a 1-hour quick wash cycle option, customer reviews suggest tempering your expectations, especially if you expect bone-dry dishes.Who should avoid it:One of Miele's drawbacks is that you have to buy from an authorized dealer -- it doesn't sell dishwashers online  -- though at least someone can help you navigate the buying process. Although Miele often earns high marks from professional reviewers, the lack of online customer reviews makes it difficult to track real-world satisfaction. This isn't unique to Miele -- other expensive dishwashers, like Thermador and JennAir, have only a handful of online reviews.Miele's 2-year warranty, while better than the 1-year coverage from brands like Bosch and Frigidaire, is a letdown for a big-ticket appliance. While extended warranties start at $319 for five years, KitchenAid offers the same perk for just $190. Overall, Miele is a solid option for energy efficiency and even includes smart home compatibility like Bosch and Samsung -- though the high prices mean it's not for folks on a budget.  ... Show more

Frigidaire
Photo Gallery 1/1
Frigidaire
Best budget dishwasher
Frigidaire FDPC4314AS
Pros
Sub-$400 price tag for a full-size dishwasher
Simple, no-frills design
More Energy Star-rated models than Whirlpool
Cons
Its plastic tub is less durable than pricier models with stainless steel tubs
Three-rack models typically cost at least $600
The loudest Frigidaire model at 54 dBa
What I like:The average dishwasher costs around $900, but it's possible to find models like the Frigidaire FDPC4314AS for less than $400. It even qualifies for the Energy Star certification, unlike most models from budget rivals like Whirlpool and Maytag. The two racks can hold up to 12 place settings, making the FDPC4314AS suitable for small and medium households. While this isn't a particularly complex design -- it lacks app integrations and a third rack --the soil sensor achieves great cleaning results.Who is it for:For a quality dishwasher without the premium price, this is a clear pick out of dozens we evaluated. Frigidaire has strong customer satisfaction, with the brand scoring a median rating of 4.4, the second highest for a budget-centric brand behind Maytag's 4.6. (For extra context, this specific model rates an impressive 4.6.) Who should avoid it:There are a few trade-offs for a budget model like this, chiefly the plastic tub, which can't match the durable stainless steel tubs in brands like Bosch, Miele and Samsung.It's also the loudest Frigidaire model at 54 dBa. While it's 16 decibels higher than the quietest model on this list, Samsung DW90F89T0USR, it's still weaker than a normal conversation. Still, it's hard to beat the Frigidaire FDPC4314AS if you want a reliable, no-frills dishwasher for less than half that of Bosch.  ... Show more

Samsung
Best smart dishwasher
Samsung DW90F89T0USR
Pros
Exceptional energy efficiency earns it the Energy Star Most
Efficient badge
Quietest model on this list at 38 dBa
Better smart home integrations and warranty than LG
Cons
While the SmartThings integration is powerful, most users will be happy with Alexa and Google controls on this brand and its competitors
Samsung is relatively new to the US dishwasher market, making online ratings harder to find
What I like:The Samsung DW90F89T0USR demonstrates that you don't need to spend big to get excellent smart home integrations with Amazon Alexa and Google Home. While LG boasts similar smart home prowess, Samsung's SmartThings remains one of the better options for smart home systems on the market, especially with the energy-tracking features.Who is it for:A smart dishwasher with a solid warranty and energy-efficient performance. LG's parts and labor warranty is half that of Samsung's two-year coverage, though LG's 10-year motor warranty balances these brands out. Speaking of energy, the DW90F89T0USR has an Energy Star Most Efficient power consumption of around 225 kWh/yr., which means you don't need to spend Miele-level prices for outstanding energy efficiency.It's also ultra-quiet at 38 dBa -- about as loud as a suburban neighborhood at night -- the quietest dishwasher I found during my evaluation. Although I collected fewer ratings for Samsung than most brands, it's still worth considering for people wanting excellent smart home features.Who should avoid it:A smart dishwasher is only worth the cost if you can imagine yourself using all those extra features and modes.  ...

Midea
Photo Gallery 1/1
Midea
Best compact dishwasher
Midea MDF18A1ABB
Pros
Costs around $400 less than the average compact dishwasher from other brands
Ideal for smaller kitchens that can't fit a full-size dishwasher
2-year warranty is great for a budget product
Cons
Relatively loud at 52 dBa
Holds only 8 place settings on 2 racks
Midea may be the "world's largest appliance manufacturer," but there are few reviews online
What I like:While most competitors sell compact 18-inch dishwasher models, the $450 Midea MDF18A1ABB stands out as a solid option for the budget crowd. Like all compact dishwashers, it holds fewer dishes than standard models—only eight place settings -- but it's an excellent choice for starter homes, vacation rentals and basement apartments that rarely host large dinners. From a brand level, Midea's 2-year warranty is refreshing compared to the 1-year coverage on pricier brands like Bosch, GE, Cafe and KitchenAid. Who is it for:Despite claiming to be the "world's largest appliance manufacturer," Midea doesn't have much of an online presence, so customer reviews are rarer but not as scarce as those from Ikea. That said, I've had enough positive experiences with other Midea products -- mainly the portable air conditioner in my home office -- to validate the brand's performance.Who should avoid it:Because this is a budget product, the 52-decibel noise levels are above average for this list, about as loud as a typical refrigerator.  ...

Cafe CDT858P3VD1 is a notable alternative to other luxury offerings from Miele and KitchenAid; however, its dishwashers more closely resemble KitchenAid's in price. Where Cafe stands apart is a deep selection of finish options for handles, which act as color accents to help these dishwashers blend into designer kitchens. Cafe is a sibling brand of GE, so you can expect similarly respectable customer ratings -- but below those of Maytag, Bosch, KitchenAid, Frigidaire and Whirlpool.GE PDT755SYVFS comes packed with three flexible racks, advanced wash jets, steam cleaning and smart home functionality. This gives it a leg up over similar KitchenAid models -- and the sale price of $879 is a tempting alternative to our Bosch dishwasher pick. GE Appliance also boasts the largest dishwasher selection in my research -- 68 models -- with most earning Energy Star certifications. Still, customer sentiment -- a median rating of 4.2 -- is slightly less positive than most competitors.Ikea Vintrosa benefits from a smaller product lineup than other dishwasher brands, meaning you don't have to track specific model numbers. It even sells some of the most affordable panel-ready dishwashers, which you can seamlessly integrate into your kitchen cabinetry. However, Ikea's dishwashers have few online reviews, making it difficult to determine the brand's real value without hands-on tests. Still, the low prices match up favorably against Frigidaire, Maytag and Whirlpool.KitchenAid KDTM404KPS uses less water, 2.4 gallons per cycle, than our Bosch pick, which retails for the same price of $999. Unlike Bosch, KitchenAid sells only two Energy Star-certified models out of the 24 found in my research. It's surprising that a well-known brand like KitchenAid hasn't caught up to the latest Energy Star standards after nearly two years. Aside from the higher energy use, KitchenAid dishwashers have very favorable reviews from customers, who often call out excellent durability.LG LDTH5554S is Samsung's closest rival for the best smart dishwasher spot, especially if you want a more affordable option for Google and Alexa controls. Like Samsung, LG offers surprisingly lengthy warranties compared to most competitors, with the 10-year motor warranty standing out as one of LG's biggest advantages. Still, LG tends to be pricier than Samsung on average and has fewer options that qualify for the Energy Star Most Efficient certification.Maytag MDB4949SKB features a stainless steel tub and an outstanding 10-year parts warranty, making it notable among the two-rack models I evaluated. Maytag is the most liked brand among customer reviews, with the only median rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars on this list. With no models over $900, its products straddle the low- and mid-price dishwasher categories. Still, it lacks smart home compatibility and an Energy Star certification. That said, it's a solid, no-frills, budget alternative to Bosch and Samsung.Whirlpool WDT750SAKB stands out for its adjustable middle rack and the option to fold down tines on the two lower racks. This kind of flexibility is great when you need just a little more space for a large pot or water bottle. Although there are more Energy Star-certified Whirlpool dishwasher models than its sibling brands, KitchenAid and Maytag, it trails far behind Frigidaire and Bosch. Whirlpool still makes excellent dishwashers, but I struggle to recommend it over more efficient competitors.Dishwashers compared

How we evaluate dishwasher brands
We did a deep dive into spec and user reviews and spoke with industry experts to find the best dishwashers for 2025. Tyler Lizenby/CNETUnlike most consumer tech and small appliances, which are easy to test in at home, large appliances like dishwashers have logistical hurdles that make hands-on testing much more difficult. The plumbing and electricity needs alone require special accommodations, not to mention the expense of shipping and storing bulky appliances.Because of this, I'm focusing on a research and data-heavy approach. I also surveyed four dishwasher experts to get the nitty-gritty details on what you should look for in a dishwasher. These experts include a dishwasher repair technician, an online appliance retailer, and two representatives for major dishwasher brands. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, they had no input in the evaluation process.I also examined over 8,200 customer ratings, prices and specifications to help you figure out the best dishwasher brand for your needs. While this approach is best for a detailed bird's-eye view of each brand, it's harder to recommend specific models based on performance, only customer satisfaction.Methodology
Extensive pricing and customer rating data are a major component of my evaluation process. CNETBefore I discuss my methodology, I want to point out that it differs heavily from those we use for hands-on testing. I normally pepper my methodologies with detailed insights and results for each product. However, the overwhelming amount of data limits me to fewer examples -- at least if I want to keep it moderately interesting.The data collection and analysis phase took over a week, which is much more than I typically dedicate to hands-on testing. However, the results provide a good foundation for my recommendations and which dishwasher model should represent each brand. Here's what I collected:8,273 data points (prices, ratings, specifications) from 679 product pages on 34 retail and manufacturer websites (as of May 9, 2025)483 unique dishwasher models across 42 brands577 ratings based on 674,348 customer reviews (some product pages didn't have ratings)Energy Star data (as of May 9, 2025)Eventually, I picked 12 noteworthy brands. While I believe the brands I chose for this dishwasher review are the best options for most people, customer sentiment was also very high for dishwasher manufacturers overall—81% of brands had a median customer rating of 4 stars or higher (out of 5 possible). I wasn't able to evaluate countertop or portable dishwashers for this review.To make this comparison and my recommendations easier, I selected a "representative model" for each brand to highlight what I like most about the company. Your budget and preferences may lead you to a different model, but the representative is a solid starting point.Evaluating over 674,000 online customer ratings to find the best dishwashers
Online customer reviews aren't the best replacement for hands-on testing, so it's vital to scale the sample size beyond a handful of models. John Carlsen/CNETFor large-scale data journalism projects like these, this means crawling every online resource I can find to create a comprehensive spreadsheet. While these numbers can help us find broad trends, there are three limitations:Limitation 1: There's a lot of overlap
Some retailers host reviews from the manufacturer's website in addition to those from their own. John Carlsen/CNETSome retailers, especially Home Depot and Lowe's, host reviews from the manufacturer's website in addition to those from their customers. To their credit, the overlapping reviews have clear labeling, but it complicates things for me.For example, the Bosch SHE53C85N has 10,907 reviews on Bosch's website, 4,924 on Lowe's and 3,140 on Home Depot. Altogether, that's 18,971 reviews. Using on-page review filters, I eliminated 3,970 overlapping reviews to reach 15,001 ratings.However, even this number isn't foolproof -- because Bosch shares reviews among similar models, making the number fuzzier with no way to focus on a single model. To Bosch's credit -- as well as other brands -- it discloses this info below shared reviews. Granted, many dishwasher models have only cosmetic differences, but I'd love to filter out as much overlap as possible.Limitation 2: Incentivized reviews
Incentivized reviews tend to skew positive so we weigh them less heavily.
John Carlsen/CNETIncentivized dishwasher reviews result from a manufacturer or retailer soliciting customer reviews after a purchase. These reviewers didn't get a free dishwasher to review, but they probably got a coupon or another benefit -- for example, KitchenAid had a Ratings and Reviews Sweepstakes in 2024.This type of review isn't completely useless since it can encourage customers who would never review a product otherwise. Still, most incentivized reviews have a tendency toward glowing reviews -- though plenty have a one-star rating. This practice may skew the numbers a little -- even when a company asks customers for an honest opinion, so it's best to treat online ratings as a rough guide rather than a definitive answer.Limitation 3: Brands that don't sell dishwashers online
A limited online retail presence means fewer user reviews to analyze. John Carlsen/CNETI can't analyze customer reviews that don't exist. Miele is the biggest example from my research because it directs buyers to authorized dealers instead of selling dishwashers directly through online retailers like Home Depot. In these cases, I rely on word of mouth, other expert reviewers and specifications, which isn't ideal. How do customer ratings affect our rankings?Filtering out all incentivized reviews and overlap may be possible with a small dataset, but it's a far more difficult with a category as large as dishwashers. Still, I feel like the sheer volume of data somewhat offsets these limitations.After identifying broad trends in the large dataset, I chose a representative model that I believe best showcases each brand's strength. The representative models are among the highest-rated products from a brand, which aren't always those with the highest ratings or most popularity.To cover my bases, I finished my customer review evaluation by running the retail links of the representative models through Fakespot, a website that scans online reviews for deceptive practices. While Fakespot is a useful resource, the only links I could verify were from Home Depot and Best Buy, as Amazon reviews of dishwashers are so rare that it's ultimately a dead end. Evaluating dishwasher specifications
Once I have a lineup of representative models, I dig deeper into the specs for those products to highlight the features that helped them stand out from the competition. MaytagWhile customer reviews can reveal consumer sentiment, they might gloss over a dishwasher's features. So, reviewers often fill in the gaps with manufacturer specifications -- even for hands-on tests. In this case, I pulled many specs from the product names in my dataset. This is because some retailers list specs in the dishwasher's name. Check out this example from Home Depot:Bosch 500 Series 24 in. White Top Control Tall Tub Pocket Handle Dishwasher with Stainless Steel Tub, 44 dBALet's break it down:Bosch 500 Series (SHP65CM2N)24 inches wide (full-sized dishwasher as opposed to an 18-inch compact dishwasher)White finish with a control panel on the top of the door and a pocket handle rather than a towel bar handleStainless steel tubSound level of 44 dBaMost dishwasher product names I collected follow a similar pattern, so I standardized the formatting. From there, all it took was a few formulas to summarize the features of hundreds of models at once. I won't stray too deep into the weeds on this -- data analysis can be very boring -- but I think it's pretty neat.Once I have a lineup of representative models, I dig deeper into the specs for those products to highlight the features that helped them stand out from the competition. These in-depth specifications are the main component of every table in this comparison. (For extra insurance, I double-checked the info on each product page before putting it in a table.)This summary data was mostly useful in evaluating sound levels. It's how I determined that Samsung (DW90F89T0U12, DW90F89P0USRAA, DW90F89P0USR), Bosch (SHP95CM5N, SHP9PCM5N) and LG (LUDP8908SN) have the quietest dishwasher models at just 38 dBa.Evaluating Energy Star data for dishwashers
Energy Star certification was a requirement for inclusion on this list. John Carlsen/CNETEvery product in the top five needed to have an Energy Star certification. A direct download on EnergyStar.gov took less than a minute to add to my spreadsheet, making this the easiest data to collect. Standard-size dishwashers must meet two criteria to earn an Energy Star label: use less than 240 kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/yr) of electricity and less than 3.2 gallons per cycle. (Energy Star says that 240 kWh per year equates to less than $50 in annual electricity costs -- $4.16 or less per month.)Requirements are tighter for compact dishwashers, which hold fewer than eight place settings. (Midea, my pick for the best compact dishwasher, holds exactly eight place settings, so it's technically a standard dishwasher, according to Energy Star.)As with specifications and consumer reviews, the Energy Star program isn't a catch-all method for finding a great dishwasher, but it's always helpful if you value energy-efficient appliances. Energy Star's greatest strength is its evolving criteria, with the latest update coming in July 2023. This also means older models won't keep an Energy Star label forever -- none of the dishwashers on Energy Star's current list were released before late 2017.Electricity usage
Various Energy Star ratings influenced my dishwasher picks. Energy StarI gave the most credit to dishwashers that meet the Energy Star Most Efficient 2025 Criteria (PDF) because they go beyond the standard certification. Miele dominates the Most Efficient category in terms of numbers -- 20 models -- which is over three times as many as qualifiers from Bosch, Samsung and LG combined. Notably, the Miele G 5892 SCVi SL is the most efficient model at 200 kWh/yr. This is 16.67% more efficient than the base Energy Star rating of 240 kWh/yr.As for the normal Energy Star rating, GE, Miele, Bosch and Frigidaire had the most models that qualified for the Energy Star rating, with at least 39 models from each company. It drops off quickly from there, with LG, Midea and Samsung boasting between 17 and 23 Energy Star models.However, Cafe, Whirlpool, KitchenAid and Maytag had fewer than 10 Energy Star models -- Maytag sells only a single model with the certification. These brands meet the previous Energy Star standard but haven't yet caught up to the latest criteria from 2023. While Ikea sells only six Energy Star models, these comprise the entire lineup, which is a nice bonus for Ikea fans.Water usage
Even the least water-efficient dishwashers use less than would be needed to hand-wash the same number of dishes. Lexy Savvides/CNETA handful of Bosch models use less than half the US Federal Standard (5 gallons) for water per cycle at just 2.3 gallons. While this is notable, even the least water-wise dishwashers on the Energy Star list use only 3.2 gallons per cycle -- a difference of just 0.9 gallons. Even dishwashers that don't meet Energy Star's electricity usage requirements can be water-wise, with the KitchenAid KDTM404KPS sipping only 2.4 gallons per cycle.However, there's a caveat with Energy Star's water usage calculations: they only examine the low end of a normal wash cycle, which sometimes uses more water on heavily soiled loads of dishes. Likewise, heavy-duty and quick wash cycles can use more water than the Energy Star specification. (You can find water usage estimates for each cycle in your dishwasher's manual or cycle guide.)Although I like knowing roughly how much water a dishwasher uses, Energy Star's water usage figures aren't useful performance indicators for other wash cycles, at least when reviewing products. For this reason, they don't influence my ranking decisions.Still, you can rest easy knowing that a full dishwasher load uses less water than hand-washing an equivalent amount of dishes in the sink. Remember to do a full load as often as you can since dishwashers' efficiency benefits diminish as load sizes go down. Dishwasher buying guide: Things to consider
I visited appliance showrooms to get my hands on the various dishwasher models. John Carlsen/CNETAfter evaluating hundreds of dishwasher models, I have one big takeaway: nearly every brand offers enough flexibility to fit your specific needs and aesthetic preferences. Once you choose a brand, you can narrow the list of potential dishwashers by looking at the cost, tub materials, cleaning methods (washing and drying) and whether you want smart home controls.Cost
Budget brands like Midea perform reliably, according to our research, but lack some of the extras found on premium dishwashers.  MideaAccording to the data I collected for this comparison, the median retail price of a dishwasher is $880, with mid-range models costing between $700 and $1,300. These mid-range brands include Bosch, Maytag, Whirlpool, GE, Samsung and LG. These midrange brands also sell a selection of budget and luxury dishwasher models.Luxury brands like KitchenAid, Cafe, Miele, JennAir, Fisher & Paykel, Thermador and Smeg have an average cost above $1,300, though Cafe and KitchenAid sell a handful of midrange models. In contrast, budget brands like Frigidaire, Ikea, Midea, Danby and SPT cost less than $700 on average.
Cheap dishwashers tend to be louder and offer fewer features than pricey models. Kseniya Ovchinnikova/GettyThe main difference between a cheap dishwasher and a luxury model is that the affordable option is usually louder and supports fewer place settings. While many budget dishwasher brands sell models with plastic tubs, there are plenty with more durable stainless steel tubs.Energy Star certifications are available at every price, though the best efficiency comes from pricier options. Racking options are another differentiator, with budget brands offering fewer adjustable racks, foldable tines, and specialty tools for washing bottles.Stainless steel tubs have several advantages over plastic ones
Stainless steel tubs have distinct advantages over their plastic counterparts. John Carlsen/CNETEvery expert I surveyed said that stainless steel is the ideal material for a dishwasher's tub. According to Morgan LaLonde, Whirlpool's Dish & Laundry Brand Manager, "Stainless steel tubs in dishwashers have many benefits, including withstanding higher water temperatures for ultimately drier dishes later in the cycle." It's also easier to maintain and looks better than plastic, which may absorb odors and stains over time.Maverick Davis, an Appliance Expert with Frontdoor, an app that offers virtual service calls for home appliance repair, noted that the tub material doesn't affect cleaning performance, just the durability and drying process. Essentially, plastic tubs are more than adequate for cleaning your dishes, even if they won't dry as quickly.Soil sensor, wash cycles and drying methods
The experts I spoke with agreed that soil sensors are critical. John Carlsen/CNETWhile the experts had varying opinions on which wash cycles are essential for a dishwasher, everyone agreed that soil sensors (also called turbidity sensors) are a must-have feature. Soil sensors work by measuring the water's cloudiness during the wash cycle and adjusting the cleaning cycle automatically. For example, a soil sensor can shorten the wash cycle for a lightly soiled load compared to a dirtier one.Soil sensors aren't new and are often a standard dishwasher feature. All of the representative models on this list use one. Still, Auto, AI or Sensor-Wash modes are usually a dead giveaway. Based on my research, most dishwashers use the soil sensor in every wash cycle, not just in Auto Mode. Likewise, models like the Frigidaire FDPC4314AS may not have a sensor-wash cycle, instead opting for always-on functionality.As for wash modes, you can expect to see Normal, Heavy, Sanitize and Quick wash cycles on most dishwashers, which should cover the basic cleaning needs of most people. (You might consider a Delicate mode if you frequently clean fine dishware.)Beyond saying that stainless steel tubs allow water droplets to run down the interior better than plastic tubs, I won't dwell on the effectiveness of different drying methods. However, entry-level dishwashers with exposed electric heating elements are more likely to melt plastic dishes than models with air-drying, evaporation and zeolite-mineral drying options.Smart home features
The extra tech can be nice, but it increases the price and complexity of a machine. Fortunately, the price is becoming less of a burden—I came across more than a dozen smart dishwashers under $700. John Carlsen/CNETAs a smart home expert, one of my biggest concerns with adding smart home technology to large appliances is that you must manually load them. And since you're already there, it's not a stretch to program your wash cycle and even set a time delay to run the dishwasher when you're asleep or out of the house. (As opposed to a smart light bulb or smart lock, which gains clear benefits from remote operation.)Despite my criticisms, there are a few reasons to choose a smart dishwasher. Dirk Sappok, Miele's North American Director of Category Management for Kitchen Appliances, says dishwasher smart home features are mainly about monitoring. A dishwasher can send notifications when a cycle ends, track energy consumption, and if the unit needs maintenance or repairs.This makes a lot of sense for people like me, who forget to unload the dishwasher for several days as dishes pile up on the counter. It's also nice to see time estimates for how long cycles last, and knowing when to clean the filter or run a maintenance cycle has a lot of value.As for remote operation via an app -- and voice controls and smart home integrations by extension -- it might be useful for some users, but shouldn't be your primary motivation for getting a smart dishwasher.
Best dishwashers FAQs
How do I extend the life of my dishwasher?
The simplest daily habit is to avoid overloading the racks, which can block and damage the spray arms. Waiting until you have a full load is also a good habit because you can underload a dishwasher. "Running partial loads often can wear out components faster," according to Davis. This is because the wash cycle runs for roughly the same amount of time regardless of how many dishes are inside.LaLonde suggests following a routine cleaning schedule for the filter, seals, and spray arms. Dishwasher filters can be easily cleaned with a soft brush and warm, soapy water. Similarly, the seals need little more than a quick wipe with a damp cloth.To deep clean the tub, spray arms and racks, consider using a dishwasher cleaning product every couple of months, like
or . While you can use Affresh with a full load of dishes, both products are suitable for adding to an empty load. Sappok points out that "most Miele dishwashers feature a water softener and recommend using salt to reactivate the softener" occasionally to prevent scaling.
Do I need to pre-rinse dishes before putting them in the dishwasher?
No, pre-rinsing dishes is overkill and can increase your water usage. However, Amy Chernoff, VP of Marketing at appliance retailer AJ Madison, says you should "always scrape food before loading." Scraping your plate over the garbage should remove larger particles that might affect cleaning performance or clog the dishwasher's filter.
Can I wash plastic dishes in the dishwasher?
You can safely wash many plastic containers in the dishwasher. However, LaLonde says it's best to stick to hard plastic dishes on the top rack, provided they have a dishwasher-safe symbol. She recommends hand-washing for "sensitive, thin plastic items, including those that contain melamine and acrylic." Some dishwashers have an enclosed heating element or a low-temperature mode for washing delicate or plastic dishes on any rack.
