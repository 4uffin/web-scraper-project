There's no substitute for a quality nonstick frying pan when time is of the essence and there isn't any extra built in for scrubbing a dirty skillet. Nonstick skillets can be had for cheap -- some as inexpensively as $25 -- and our sizzling hot (sorry) take is that, with a few exceptions, you don't need to splurge big to get a reliable one. That most nonstick skillets inevitably wear out -- unlike other cookware materials -- is even more reason to bag a budget-friendly pan you can use and abuse.

What's the best overall nonstick pan? After more than 20 hours of sizzling pancakes to test evenness, vaporizing ice cubes to test heating speed and frying eggs to evaluate how nonstick these nonstick pans really are, the $35 Tramontina Professional skillet emerged as the best overall nonstick frying pan to buy. But hours of testing more than a dozen pans revealed other nontoxic, nonstick skillets worthy of a spot on your rack.
MisenNonstick pans come in various types. Ceramic coatings are often seen as a cleaner alternative, while chemical-coated nonstick pans are cheaper, though certain types can become toxic if overheated. (Here's how to make sure your nonstick pan won't cause issues.) Most newer nonstick pans, as well as those from trusted manufacturers are made with materials widely considered to be nontoxic and food safe, so the choice comes down to what matters most to you as a cook.
Good nonstick frying pans will see you through a lot of busy mornings. David Watsky/CNETBelow you'll find our picks for the absolute best nonstick and ceramic frying pans to buy in 2025. Best nonstick frying pans for 2025
Tramontina
Photo Gallery 1/1
Tramontina
Best nonstick pan overall
Tramontina Professional fry pan
Pros
At under $40, it is a great value buy
Light and easy to maneuver
Available in four sizes
Cons
Thinner pan, which could mean easier warping
Rough bottom could scratch a glass stovetop
Why I like it:Combining performance with real value, Tramontina's 10-inch skillet takes the top spot for the best nonstick frying pan. You can find cheaper pans -- and plenty that cost more -- but none of the under-$50 bunch matched Tramontina's combination of nonstick prowess, even heating and handle comfort. It's oven-safe up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. It performed exceptionally well in our pancake and fried egg test, and the lightweight frying pan was easy to maneuver around the stovetop. This wallet-friendly pan is available in four sizes, from 8 inches to 14 (an unusually large size and more pan than the average chef would want or need).Who is it good for?This is the perfect budget pick for a new chef or someone unwilling to spend loads on fancy cookware.Who should avoid it? This pan is not compatible with induction stoves, so those who use one should look elsewhere. If you're planning to really go hard with your new nonstick skillet, this might not be the one. The base is thinner cast aluminum, which should resist warping, but has less heft than some competitors, which could spell a shorter lifespan than some other skillets on our list.  ... Show more

Misen
Another great pan
Misen 10-inch pan
Pros
Sturdily built with a thicker coating than other pans
4-inch aluminum core resists warping
Comfortable handle
Cons
On the expensive side for a nonstick skillet
Why I like it:For a nonstick skillet, the Misen 10-inch pan ticked more performance boxes than any other, but at $89, it's by no means a budget-friendly pick. It's sturdy but not heavy and sports a premium surface that turns out eggs and pancake batter with no sticking. Misen's nonstick pans use a PFOA-free, three-layer platinum coating that I found just slightly more nonstick than others. The gently flared sides allowed for pancakes and eggs to slide out without the use of a spatula, but still kept contents from spilling over during cooking, even when given a few shakes. Who should get it?If a comfortable grip is important to you, this is the pan. What pushed the Misen pan over the top for me was the ergonomic handle that makes for a seriously comfortable gripper. The handle also has just a slight slant, something I find makes negotiating things like eggs and pancakes easier since they often require a good bit of maneuvering and flipping. Misen's excellent pan is available in three sizes: 8, 10 and 12 inches. Who is it not good for?At $100, this is not a cheap nonstick pan. You can find reliable nonstick skillets for less than half this price, but they might not offer the same durability and design.  ... Show more

Made In

Made In
Best ceramic frying pan
Made in CeramiClad frying pan
Pros
Vaporized an ice cube faster than any nonstick pan we tested
Cooked evenly and released food with ease
Sturdy build and 4-inch aluminum core for durability
Looks great
Cons
$130 is a lot for one nonstick frying pan
What I liked: I'll start by saying that I really loved this pan and think it's worth every penny -- and it do cost a few. The Made In ceramic skillet released food exceptionally well and heated the most evenly of any nonstick pan we tested, ceramic or otherwise. It also heated faster than any other, turning a nugget of ice into vapor in an astounding 11 seconds when the burner under it was turned on high from the off position. The coating held up when confronted with a ding from my metal spatula and the handle was easy to grip. It's slightly heavier than some of the nonstick pans in our test cohort, but that's largely due to its 4-inch aluminum core and five-ply build. Who is it for:This ceramic pan looks, feels and performs just like a professional piece of cookware. It heats with exceptional speed, sears as well as a nonstick pan, and lets go of food when it's ready to be plated. Unlike traditional nonstick pans, which aren't oven-safe above 400 F, ceramic pans like the Made In CeramiClad can hit the oven up to 550 degrees F.Who should avoid it:At $130, this is one of the most expensive skillets we tried, but the unique performance justifies its place on our list.  ...

HexClad
Photo Gallery 1/1
HexClad
Best nonstick pan for high-heat cooking
HexClad hybrid frying pan
Pros
Imparts a better sear than typical nonstick kitchenware
Resistant to metal use
Sturdy build and comfortable handle
Dishwasher and oven-safe
Cons
Expensive
Not as nonstick as fully nonstick pans
Why I like it:HexClad is an intriguing addition to the nonstick conversation. While I'd almost never recommend spending nearly $150 on a single nonstick pan, given the inevitable surface erosion and short lifespan, HexClad may be the exception. This unique skillet's surface combines nonstick ceramic with a honeycomb pattern of raised stainless steel to protect it. The HexClad promise is that you'll get the benefits of nonstick but with the searing abilities of stainless steel in a pan that should last longer than the average nonstick.Who is it good for?If you want the low-effort of a nonstick pan but with the ability to sear meat like steaks and pork chops, Hexclad is one of the only ones that will.Who should avoid it?If you're looking for the true sear you get from stainless steel and cast iron, this pan comes close but won't quite get crusts and sears the way those pure materials do. I found that the hybrid surface does indeed release food in much the same way most other nonstick pans do. It's also expensive, so not a good pick for the budget-conscious.

All-Clad
Photo Gallery 1/1
All-Clad
Best nonstick pan set for induction cooktops
All-Clad Hard-Anodized skillets (set of 2)
Pros
High sides are great for avoiding a mess
Good value for a legacy cookware brand
Works on induction stovetops
Cons
Heavier than other nonstick pans
Coating scratches easily&nbsp;if not handled properly
What I like about it:All-Clad is known for its chef-level stainless steel cookware, but the Pennsylvania-based producer makes quality nonstick pans, too. If you want more than one nonstick fry pan, I recommend All-Clad's excellent hard-anodized nonstick pans, which come in a set of two for around $100. I've used an All-Clad hard-anodized nonstick skillet regularly for about five years and am happy with the performance.Instead of a fully aluminum base, these nonstick pans have an aluminum core reinforced for durability -- aka hard anodized -- and encased in bonded stainless steel, making them compatible with induction cooktops. This set is great for those more those who handle cookware aggressively. For the gentler home cook, a less durable Essentials set (not hard-anodized aluminum) set of the same pans is available for $80. Who is it good for?The high sloped sides make the All-Clad pans a good pick for those who tend to make a mess when pan-frying. Having a set is handy if you use nonstick cookware often.Who should avoid it?The nonstick coating releases food well, but it will chip fairly easily if you slip and use a metal or hard plastic utensil on it.

In truth, a lot of these nonstick skillets performed well in their most basic duty to cook food and then subsequently release it for an easy clean. The reason some didn't make the cut was a bloated price tag that just doesn't seem worth it for a pan that only lasts a few years. Others didn't have handles I loved, had balance issues, cooked less evenly than the top-rated pans, or had other small flaws that edged them out of the top spots. In short: most of the pans below will get you through your morning routine without a major headache -- but you've come here for the best of the best.OXO Good Grips fry pan: This nonstick pan performed well and would be a fine alternative to the Tramontina pan we selected.Made in Nonstick Frying Pan: This was a close second for best premium nonstick pan, but the $149 price tag keeps it out of the top.Caraway ceramic nonstick frying pan: This pan released food well, but had slow conductivity in our ice test. It's also expensive.Ninja Neverstick premium skillet: The Neverstick from Ninja performed well in testing but had more uneven heat distribution than some on our list.T-Fal Prograde titanium nonstick fry pan: Another that didn't receive any failing grades and would be a fine nonstick pan to stock your rack with.Viking Culinary nonstick fry pan: This heavy, stainless steel frying pan conducted heat quickly and the nonstick worked well, but $219 is too much to pay for a cookware material that will break down over time.Material The Coated Pan: This copper-core nonstick pan conducts heat better than anything else, but $120 is still too much for a non-ceramic nonstick pan.Calphalon nonstick frying pan: Nothing about this pan stood out in our testing and it's not cheap at nearly $80 for a 10-inch skillet.Abbio nonstick skillet (Update: Currently unavailable) Factors to consider: Nonstick pan buying guide
Surface material: Traditional nonstick vs. ceramicA lot has been said about nonstick cookware and not all of it good. Teflon, a synthetic fluoropolymer (PFOA), was used heavily in cookware in starting in the 1960s but was later found to cause cancer. In 2002, all use of nonstick coatings using PFOA was banned, and modern nonstick coatings are widely considered safe, including all of the frying pans we tested for this list.
Nothing is less sticky than traditional chemically coated nonstick pans, but ceramic comes awfully close. Pamela Vachon/CNETCeramic cookware, an all-natural alternative to chemically coated nonstick pans, has become popular with those still wary about forever chemicals in cookware. Most cookware brands now offer a ceramic line of nonstick pots and pans with some brands including Greenpan and Caraway specializing in the material. Ceramic cookware is able to withstand hotter temperatures, while nonstick pans can leach chemicals when heated above 500 F. Ceramic cookware has it's drawbacks, however. It's typically not as nonstick as traditional nonstick cookware and many types show wear faster. It's also more expensive, on the whole, with quality ceramic frying pans starting at around $50 and many costing over $100.
Made In's nontoxic ceramic skillet is a pricey but impressive piece of kitchen equipment. Made InCooking performance and care for the two types are similar. Both release food well but don't impart as much surface heat as stainless steel or cast iron, making it harder to get a proper sear on meats like beef, pork and chicken. It is recommended to use wooden utensils and to hand-wash both types of nonstick cookware so as not to damage the coating. For more, here's CNET's guide to nontoxic cookware. Core material
You have three basic options for the core material breakdown of your nonstick skillet. All three of these skillet types will have a nonstick coating. These coatings are largely made from a synthetic fluoropolymer called polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. Teflon is a familiar brand name for this nonstick material that you've likely heard of. Some cheap pan producers use fewer coatings of PTFE and so will wear out faster.
A visual tutorial on how not to store nonstick kitchenware. David Watsky/CNETIt's what's underneath the PTFE that matters more and, depending on your cooking needs and the type of stovetop you use, one might be better for you than the others. Fully aluminum Fully aluminum nonstick skillets are great because they are light and cheap -- nonstick skillets have a short lifespan -- but they don't have the structure that comes with tough stainless steel, so they're likely to warp faster. They heat up quicker than other pans since aluminum is a fierce conductor but won't work on induction surfaces.Aluminum core with steel plate bonded to the bottom With a stainless steel plate fasted to the bottom, your pan is likely to have more rigidity so if you tend to abuse cookware, it shouldn't warp or dent as easily. These pans are great because they'll work on induction stoves. The downside is that they're a bit heavier and generally more expensive.Aluminum core fully encased in stainless steel This makeup is similar to those described above except the stainless steel plate surrounds the aluminum core entirely. These pans will also work with induction heating elements but have even more total weight and often cost more, too. On the plus side, you'll have a sturdy pan with a core that should better withstand abuse. Be ready to exercise some patience, however, since a stainless steel-wrapped pan will take longer to heat up than one made of only aluminum. CopperHeats faster and more evenly than aluminum but is far more expensive. Considering most nonstick pans don't last forever, the copper core feels like a waste unless you're rolling in dough.
The materials that your pan is made from will affect the weight, durability and stove compatibility. And price too, of course. David Watsky/CNET How we test nonstick skillets
There are a few simple tests I run on nonstick skillets for measuring even heating, surface flatness as well as each pan's nonstick properties and ability to release food. Fried and eggs and omelets: Classic nonstick fare The first and arguably most important test shows us how well each pan releases sticky foods, including eggs and pancakes. I cooked both a fried egg and a whipped egg omelet in each. The hope is that each one releases the food completely once cooked, with as little food left as possible. In truth, all of the fry pans released the eggs well during this test and with no single skillet flunking. There were some slight variances in performance, however. The pans I've selected as my top picks in each category all performed as well or better than average.
This is the lift you can expect with a good nonstick skillet. David Watsky/CNETPancakes reveal all. Well, a lot anywayI also cooked a pan-size pancake in each pan -- a test that does double duty. Beyond illuminating a pan's non-stickiness, it also shows how evenly a skillet heats and cooks.
Browning a pancake shows us how evenly a pan cooks and how well it releases a notoriously sticky breakfast food. David Watsky/CNETAfter loading a cold pan with one cup of pancake batter, I turned the heat on and let it cook for two minutes. Normally, you'd add pancake batter to a preheated pan but here I want the batter to spread evenly and settle in the pan before cooking so I can really see if they have hot or cold spots. I flipped the pancake out of the pan and upside down. It was a messy business, but what was revealed on the other side were pancake darkness gradients that shed light on each pan's ability to cook evenly across its surface. We cooked ice to test conduction speedTo test each pan's conduction speed, we placed one nugget ice cube in the center and turned the burner below on high. We then timed how long it took the cube to melt and vaporize, showing us how quickly the pan is able to heat up. The top-performing pan was Made In's CeramiClad ceramic skillet, which turned the nugget of ice into vapor in an astounding 11 seconds. Others in the cohort took as long as a minute.
We tested how quickly each pan heats up using a single nugget of ice. Made In's CeramiClad skillet disappeared the ice completely in 11 seconds. David Watsky/CNETOther considerations While performing these tests, I'm also careful to note other factors like a pan's overall size, weight and balance on the stove. I also consider the height and slope angle of its sides as well as the angle and construction of the handle. Some of these factors are admittedly subjective, especially handle comfort, so it might make sense to find a cookware superstore and test various handles before making a final selection.
It might seem like a small thing, but the handle angle can make a big difference in maneuvering the pan. I like the subtle slope of the Misen pan. The rubber sheath was easy on my hand. David Watsky/CNETDurability of nonstick coatings This is a trickier factor to assess. Ultimately, you'll want your nonstick coating to last as long as possible, but you're really only able to gauge this with consistent use over time. In my experience, decent nonstick frying pans will last anywhere from three to four years before they really start to break down. While I don't have the luxury of testing each pan's durability over that timespan, I do look deep into reviews on each pan to see if there were any red flags or patterns that might suggest they corrode faster.
If your nonstick skillet looks anything like this, it's time to pony up for a fresh pan. David Watsky/CNETWhile no nonstick pan will last forever, a few of our picks including the Made In ceramic and Misen nonstick feature multiple layers of reinforced
surface which should conceivably give them a longer life. The pricier pans also typically have a tougher core with more layers (plys) of stronger aluminum -- often referred to as "hard-anodized" aluminum -- so they're less susceptible to warping.But, remember, a strong inner core doesn't mean much if the surface wears out after a few years, so be careful where you spend your money and even more careful cooking with your pans if you want to get good bang for your buck.
Price was one of the biggest factors
Made In's excellent ceramic skillet is one of the only pans we deemed worthy of a true splurge. For a traditional non-ceramic nonstick pan, you'll do fine with Tramontina's $35 offering. Made InBecause of the short lifespan, you'd be wise not to spend a fortune on one nonstick skillet. Besides the HexClad, Misen and Made In CeramiClad which offer unique surface makeup and exceptional performance, I don't recommend spending more than $70 or $80 on a single nonstick skillet.If you go too cheap (pans under $30 or so), you'll find that nonstick coatings start to corrode much more quickly and you'll need to replace them sooner. I've made this mistake before and it's simply not worth the hassle just to save a few bucks. Cost and value were some of the biggest determining factors I considered when choosing the best nonstick fry pans for 2025.  Quick guide to caring for your nonstick cookware
You should never use metal on nonstick skillets since they will scrape and scratch the coating and cause the skillet to lose its nonstick surface much faster.Nonstick cooking spray is also not recommended for PTFE-coated pans. It can lead to a filmy buildup over time. Butter or natural cooking oil is your friend but a good, new nonstick pan shouldn't need much help.Don't use high heat when cooking with your nonstick skillet. Scorching temps will damage the sensitive nonstick surface.Always handwash your nonstick pan. Some skillets are technically "dishwasher safe" but exposing them to that much hot water and soap for long periods will erode the nonstick surface over time. Plus, quality nonstick pans generally don't take more than a few soft wipes with a wet sponge and hot water to get clean. Storing nonstick cookware properly is also paramount. If you're going to stack it, use rubber or felt separators to protect the nonstick finish.
Nonstick skillet FAQ
Is nonstick cookware compatible with induction stovetops?
Because induction cooking relies on magnetic fields to generate heat through cookware, nonstick pans must have a magnetic base -- usually made of stainless steel or iron -- in order to work on induction cooktops. Some nonstick cookware has aluminum or copper bases with no magnetic properties, and thus won't work on your induction stove.
How long does nonstick cookware last?
If you care for it properly (no metal, only handwashing), a typical nonstick skillet should last about four or five years before it starts to wear down and lose its nonstick ability. If you use your nonstick skillet more than three times per week, this timeline might shrink a bit. And if you only bust it out once per week or less, you'll probably have it a bit longer than five years.
Is it safe to use nonstick cookware?
Is ceramic cookware better than nonstick?
Ceramic nonstick cookware has become a popular option. The main brag is that these pans use no chemicals versus traditional PTFE surfaces. While that may be true, the chemicals used in modern nonstick aren't shown to be harmful when used properly.The downside of ceramic coatings is that they often lose their nonstick properties a bit faster than PTFE surfaces. They also tend to be more expensive, with skillets from popular producers, including Made In and Caraway, costing upwards of $100 for a single skillet.
Can you use metal utensils on nonstick cookware?
No. You should always use wood, rubber or soft plastic when cooking with nonstick. Nearly all nonstick cookware surfaces, including ceramic, will become damaged and break down faster if you use metal. The one exception we've encountered is HexClad's hybrid skillet since it features a ceramic skillet intertwined with stainless steel to protect the fragile nonstick.
