How we test
What to consider
Posture
Avoid back, arm and wrist pain with good posture. Sit back in your seat and support your feet the best you can.
Ergonomics
A chair with lumbar support will help keep your lower back from getting sore. If it doesn’t have support, roll up a towel and put it behind your back.
Wheel quality
It may not feel important, but an office chair with wheels that roll well will make your life easier. Look for strong wheels or invest in an upgrade.

As both a tech editor and an avid gamer, I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, and I've come to understand what makes a chair comfortable. To find the most comfortable office chair to save you from back pain and other discomfort, I’ve tested a wide range of options. From luxury chairs to hardworking gaming seats, I've got what your behind needs to be comfortable. Choosing the right chair is vital, and it's an afterthought all too often. It should be comfortable with the right support to get you through long shifts. And while selecting the right office chair is a personal choice, ergonomics and even aesthetics still matter to most people.

What is the best office chair of 2025?If you spend time working, gaming or doing anything that involves sitting for a long time, you need a high-quality, supportive chair. Our top pick, the Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro, is a great midrange option that's comfortable, durable and looks great.

With remote and hybrid work becoming the norm, the dedicated home office space has become more essential than ever, making a good chair imperative.We've been testing office chairs at CNET for more than nine years, and I've been sitting on them for decades.

Best overall office chair
Ergonomic Chair Pro from Branch
Pros
The adjustability is amazing, especially around the arms
The well-padded seat makes long-term sitting a breeze
The suede material feels great and looks and feels premium
Cons
The wheels are not great on carpets or rugs
What I like about it:The Ergonomic Pro chair is the latest addition to Branch's impressive lineup. Taking cues from the Verve chair and other ergonomic chairs, you can feel the quality and pedigree when you sit on it. The whole chair feels incredibly well put together, with a solid metal wheel base instead of nylon, and fixtures and fittings the ooze quality. The lumbar support is excellent and while the headrest is a little low for my large frame, it's comfortable to lean back on when taking a rest from typing.The Ergo Pro's many adjustment points also make for a comfortable seat. The arms can move in almost any direction, up and down, of course, but also forward, back, and even twist to get the perfect angle for support when you're working. It does help to reduce wrist strain when you get the arm position right. Who is it good for:The Ergonomic Pro is our best office chair overall because it's great for everyone. The stylish look and comfortable foam seat make it a great all-rounder for anyone. If you spend 8 hours a day at a desk then this is the chair to do it in.Who shouldn't get it:The wheels are the only small detail I would change about the Ergo Pro. A chair this good deserves proper rubber wheels to make it roll more easily. If you have thick carpet in your office I would swap these wheels out for some inline skate style wheels.  ... Show more

Best value office chair
Amazon Basics leather-padded swivel chair
Pros
The most budget of all the budget choices at under $100
The cushioning is soft and comfortable, like a cloud
Good looking for such a low budget chair
Cons
The lack of lumbar support can make sitting uncomfortable for long periods
What I like about it:I liked this Amazon Basics chair right away. This swivel style was easy to assemble, the leather-like design looks nice, and the adjustable seat and back are cushioned and comfortable. It's a great chair to use if you're sitting at a desk for an hour or so to do homework or write the occasional email.Who is it good for:Not everyone sits at a desk for eight hours a day. Sometimes you might only need a chair for a few minutes. The AmazonBasics chair is good enough for occasional use such as homework.Who shouldn't get it:This chair is relatively affordable without sacrificing much, with one exception: lumbar support. If lumbar support is a must-have, consider one of our other favorites. They may cost a little more, but they will be better for your back in the long run.  ... Show more

HON
Best mid-priced office chair
Hon Ignition 2.0
Pros
The lightweight material is breathable yet sturdy
You can adjust the arms, legs, back and even the seat position
Cons
Lumbar doesn't sit quite high enough to fully support a taller frame
What I like about it:The Ignition 2.0 is an extremely well-constructed chair. Once it is put together it oozes sophistication and looks fantastic in my office space. I'm a big guy so I am always concerned that chairs won't hold my weight but the Ignition is clearly designed with people like me in mind.Adjustments can be made to the lumbar, height and armrests but my favorite is being able to move the seat in and out. My long legs often feel unsupported but having the seat further forward supports me far better. I do wish the armrests would turn as well as rise, though, as that better supports my forearms as I type, reducing the strain on my wrists. Who is it good for:The Hon 2.0 is an every-person chair. Whether you're 6 feet, 260 pounds or 5 feet, 4 inches, 130 pounds, you'll find it comfortable. Choose the Hon if you're writing at a desk all day and need good support.Who shouldn't get it:Mesh back chairs are not for everyone. They sometimes look and feel a little too much like office furniture. If you are looking for something a little classier then there are better options.  ... Show more

Previous best overall office chair
The Verve by Branch
Pros
The build quality is so good it feels like a chair hundreds of dollars more expensive
Assembly was very easy, requiring only a few screws
The wheels are much better than the Ergonomic Pro
Cons
The material is comfortable, but gets dirty very quickly from routine use
What I like about it:The Verve chair by Branch has been the best overall chair for a while, and it only lost the top spot because the new Ergonomic Chair Pro stole it. It has fantastic lumbar support and a wide, firm base that cushions your rear as you work long hours. The setup was simple, and the instructions were easy to follow. I especially like the note to use the box as a riser to help put the back on. That's a helpful tip! I found the wheels to be of good quality, something that even expensive chairs overlook. Everything about it says it's a costly chair, except for the price. It's not cheap, but the price range is great if you spend 40 hours a week sitting on it and want to feel your legs when you stand up.My only minor pet peeve with the Verve was how quickly it picked up dirt. The corner of the seat is already showing signs of staining from rubbing on my clothes, and over months or years, this is only going to get worse. Who is it good for:Like the Ergonomic Pro from Branch, the Verve is an excellent all-around chair that's good for anyone who spends their day sitting at a desk. The colors and material choices make it look great in any space, and it doesn't suffer from looking too business-yWho shouldn't get it:There isn't really a person this chair isn't good for. The only limit is your budget. If you feel it's too pricey for your space, then there are chairs in the list that would do as well.  ... Show more

Best office chair for large frames
Ergo Chair Ultra 2
Pros
Cushioning was comfortable even for my 270-pound frame
Extremely easy to build with solid nuts and bolts
Breathable fabric keeps my back cool even in the depths of summer
Cons
The armrests don't twist which can make them less comfortable than other chairs
What I like about it:The Autonomous Ergo Chair is a solid entry into our best office chair category. It's well-designed to hold someone with a larger frame, with an extremely comfortable seat pad and lumbar support that you can really feel. The solid metal feel throughout, especially on the wheel hub, is welcome as it supports me well. Nylon wheel hubs can sometimes stretch, causing the pillar to slip through over time and scrape the floor. Having a metal hub negates that issue. That being said, I wish the wheels on the Ergo Chair Ultra were better. When I installed them, they were difficult to fit -- unlike every other part of the build -- and they don't glide as well as I would like. The wheels are pretty weak for a chair that can hold up to 300 pounds. I would like to see some roller-blade-style wheels on this in the future.Who is it good for:I'm a big guy, 270 pounds and six feet 1 inch, and I found the Ergo chair to be an extremely comfortable choice. If you are looking for something with good padding for an ample frame, I think the Ergo chair would be right for you.Who shouldn't get it:Like many of the office chair entries, the wheels let the Ergo chair down. If you have deep-pile carpet in your office, you may want to swap out your wheels for something better if you buy this chair.Comfort rating: Very comfortable   ... Show more

Best office chair with full control
OdinLake Upgrade 518
Pros
Fully adjustable arms, back and lumbar support
Solidly built construction was easy to put together
A great set of wheels, which as we all know, is a blessing
Cons
The armrests are fully adjustable, but hard to rest on for long hours
What I like about it:It's a big deal to have a chair that can easily take my weight while remaining comfortable and adjustable. I like that the OdinLake has everything adjustable. From the arms to the seat and lumbar positions, it can all be tweaked to fit your sitting style. I like a lower lumbar support with the arms at an angle to help me type, and the OdinLake gave me those options. And, as an even bigger bonus, the wheels are excellent and will run well on any surface. I also tested the more expensive Ergo Max 747 and while it is as good as the Upgrade 518, I found the seat to be a little less comfortable over time. It's not that the Ergo Max 747 is a bad chair; it's just not significantly better than the Upgrade 518, which is a fraction of the cost.Who is it good for:If your office is carpeted or you have a rug under your desk, the OdinLake is a good choice, as the wheels are excellent. It's a great choice if you like to sit in different positions throughout the day. Who shouldn't get it:It has a very "office furniture" vibe to it, which may not fit with your home office decor. If you want something a little less clinical you might want to look elsewhere.  ... Show more

Steelcase

Steelcase
Best build-your-own office chair
Steelcase Karman
Pros
So many customization choices for aesthetic and comfort changes
Rock solid movement shows how good the build quality is
Cons
Seat wings are a little high, so people with wider hips may start to feel uncomfortable
What I like about it:The newest chair from Steelcase wins a spot on this list not because it's comfortable -- although it is, especially in the lumbar region -- but because of its customization options. You can choose the color of the chair, and you can also add additional lumbar support (you'll want that), additional movement for the armrests, and wheels for hard floors or carpets. I found the chair excellent over long periods, and I especially liked how well the locking system works. Some chairs feel like they lean back too far, even when locked, but the Karman was rock solid the whole time. The wings of the seat were a little high, so I couldn't have my wallet in my back pocket without it pushing uncomfortably. If you have wide hips the high wings may cause discomfort.Who is it good for:Customization is key with the Steelcase Karmon. If you're looking for a chair that will fit perfectly into your home, one that you can make fit your aesthetic perfectly, then I would go for this. It's pricey but worth it if you're looking for the exact right thing.Who shouldn't get it:The price is high on the Steelcase, so if customization is not necessary to you, then there are better ways to spend your money. The best overall pick is a more comfortable chair, even if it doesn't give as many options.  ... Show more

Best mesh backed office chair
Oak Hollow Aloria Series
Pros
The mesh back allows for a lot of free airflow, making it cooler to sit on for long periods
The chair works great for everyone, including tall people like me
Cons
The entire chair is cumbersome and hard to move around so build it in the room you are using it in
What I like about it:If you're a fan of a tall, well-ventilated back on a chair with plenty of adjustment options, Oak Hollow's Aloria Series offers an impressive option. It's simple to set up, feels incredibly sturdy, and the controls on the left and right sides of the seat make it easy to set up for your body quickly.This chair is available in Standard and Tall seat height options, and it's important to know that even the lower option sits high enough that, at 6 feet tall, my feet leave the ground when leaning back further than the first position in this chair. If that's not something you're worried about, this chair will keep you cooler than most and plenty comfortable.Who is it good for:Tall people will feel much more comfortable on the Aloria chair than almost any other in this list. The seat is adjustable, and there is even an optional longer stem if you're taller than 6'1".Who shouldn't get it:The Aloria chair is heavy. If you don't want to push a big, heavy chair around your house, look at other options. That being said, the weight comes from the solid construction, so it's not always a negativeComfort rating: Very comfortable  ... Show more

Pros
Mesh back reduces sweating and stays clean for longer
Well-cushioned armrests make leaning while on Zoom calls very comfortable
The excellent headrest also works well to relive stress like the armrests
Cons
Lumbar doesn't move up and down so what you see is what you get
What I like about it:Like the OC14 before it, the C7 has an extremely comfortable headrest. You may not use it all day like your lumbar support, but it does make more relaxed moments much nicer. The mesh back is very comfortable as well. It's breathable but feels strong enough to support my weight without ripping.I like the soft padded armrests; they're adjustable in three ways: in/out, up/down, and left/right. However, I wish the lumbar support were equally adjustable. It can move in and out, but it can't be raised to fit the curve of my tall back, so it never feels as supportive as I would like. Who is it good for:Having a headrest on your chair is more comfortable than you might think. Resting your head on breaks or while in meetings can relieve neck pain and stress. If you find yourself in a lot of meetings rather than typing, the C7 is a comfy way to do thatWho shouldn't get it:I can't think of anyone the C7 isn't well suited for. The lumbar support doesn't move up and down but sits low to stabilize your pelvis. If you find that type of support uncomfortable, then you may want to choose a more traditional chair support.  ...

The best office chair for gaming
Axion gaming chair
Pros
Cool looking design that fits well in any gaming space
Excellent adjustable parts make it a comfortable every-chair, not just a gaming one
A good headrest makes relaxing between work a more comfortable experience
Cons
This is yet another chair that should have the rubber wheels rather than casters
What I like about it:The harsh truth about gaming chairs is that they are uncomfortable. Even the best gaming chairs are only comfortable for short periods of time, despite how cool they look. The Axion gaming chair from Eureka improves on the feel of standard gaming chairs by bringing in office chair-style ergonomics, all while looking like it could be a part of a futuristic gaming setup. The chunky plastic, bright colors and shiny dials give it a more "gamer" look than a traditional office chair.But make no mistake, this gaming chair can function as an office chair as well, and a good one at that. It hits all of the ergonomic points required for a good office chair, like lumbar support and adjustable arms. It's incredibly comfortable to sit in for a full eight-hour day. I especially like the large headrest, as it lets you rest your head back while still being comfortable to work and game. Who is it good for:If your gaming room is your home office, then the Axion from Eureka is the best of both worlds. It looks cool, like you'd want from your gaming chair, but it actually relaxing to sit in for hours at a time. Who shouldn't get it:If you have an office area that is more business than pleasure or needs to look business-like, then the Axiom may be a little gaudy. It's incredibly comfortable, but may not be aesthetically pleasing for everyone.  ... Show more

Best low-price mesh back office chair
Sihoo Doro C300
Pros
Breathable mesh back is very comfortable even for long periods
Comfortable armrests make typing a safer experience
Excellent back support adjusts on the fly to your sitting position so your back is always supported
Cons
Seat doesn't move in and out to support your knees as needed
What I like about it:The Doro C300 is an extremely comfortable and fully meshed office chair. The headrest adjusts to fit my long frame, although I do find the seat a little shorter than I'd prefer for my legs. The armrests are very well-padded and move easily across a full range of motion, which is especially important when you are typing for eight hours a day. The lumbar support automatically adjusts as you lean back, which I found helpful, and the wheelbase is solid metal, not nylon, so there is less chance of it coming loose over time. Build time was fairly short, around 20 minutes, and the entire chair feels very stable, especially for a lower-priced model.Who is it good for:If you want an excellent office chair that's priced much lower than it should be, then the C300 is a great choice. It's easy to buy, easy to make, and easy to use.Who shouldn't get it:I found the chair cushion a little shorter than I like. It doesn't support my knees as well as some other chairs. If you have long legs, this might get uncomfortable over time.

The most comfortable office chair I've ever used
The Anthros chair
Pros
The most comfortable I've ever been at a desk
Very easy to build and took less than 10 minutes to put together
Upper back support is amazing and the pelvis support actually helps relieve past pain
Cons
It's prohibitively expensive for almost everyone except the most senior executives
What I like about it:The Anthros chair is amazing. The lumbar support helps stabilize your pelvis in a way that feels different from normal lumbar support, to the point where my back pain has completely gone while using it. it evens clears any back pain I get from sitting on office chairs that didn't make the best list. The seat adjusts to rest your feet perfectly on the ground, and the wide seat is comfortable for all body types, including my 270-pound frame. The Anthros comes with a posture guarantee, so if you don't feel it has helped your posture or made you feel comfortable, you can get your money back. The Anthros feels high quality, and if money were no object, it would be my No. 1 pick (and I would tell you to buy one too). Money does matter, though, and the Anthros are downright expensive. A good chair for your office is an investment that should last a long time, but at nearly $2,000, it's probably worth some serious thought before you take the plunge.Who is it good for:If you're looking for the pinnacle of office comfort and have a little under $2,000 to spend, then I cannot recommend this chair enough. Who shouldn't get it:Everyone who isn't the tiny percentage of people mentioned above.  ... Show more

Best budget executive office chair
Eureka Galene executive chair
Pros
Has a much more executive look and feel than the price tag suggests
Great back support for long meetings
Came in only a few pieces so very easy to build
Cons
Only one adjustment available on the arms, so it can be uncomfortable typing for long periods
What I like about it:It's often hard to find an executive chair that looks great but doesn't break the bank. The cheaper ones tend to look underwhelming, while the truly expensive ones are great but out of the realm of John or Jane Q. Public. The Galene from Eureka is an excellent balance between cost and quality. It looks good and is very comfortable to sit on for long periods. The build took about 20 minutes, and it doesn't suffer from the wobbles that budget chairs often fall victim to. It feels like a much more expensive chair than it actually is.My only wish is that instead of arms that just raise and lower, they had more articulation so I could tailor them to my needs. Executive chairs are really designed for comfort on calls and meetings rather than extended typing, so having arms that can adjust more dynamically to my position would be great.Who is it good for:If you're looking for that executive feel to your office but you don't want to break the bank, the Galene is perfect. The leather and overall opulence make it a great choice for looking good.Who shouldn't get it:If you work at your desk for eight hours, typing furiously at your keyboard, you need the right support for your arms. The Galene doesn't give you that, so other chairs may work better.  ... Show more

Factors to consider when choosing an office chair
ErgonomicsErgonomics is the "science of work," says Gary Allread, program director for the ergonomics division at Ohio State University's Spine Research Institute. That definition doesn't apply only to our jobs; ergonomic principles can be used for pretty much any activity (and that means an ergonomic office chair isn't going to immediately fix your lower back pain). Allread and his team offer consultations for a variety of workplaces, including manufacturing plants. They even provide input on product design to help companies better understand how to create products "to make sure they can interact with people as well as possible," Allread says.
Chair posture
A less-than-ideal work setup might cause pain in your back, arms, hands or wrists. You might also find yourself fidgeting, making more mistakes or taking more breaks, all because you're uncomfortable, Allread warns. Long-term, you might end up with tendonitis or carpal tunnel syndrome.
Allread offers two main suggestions we all can try to improve how we work:
Sit with your back against your chair. ("You want the chair to do the work and not your back," he says.)Support your feet. Either plant your feet on the floor or, if they don't reach, use a box or other footrest to support your feet.Lumbar supportIf your chair lacks lumbar support, Allread recommends rolling up a towel, securing it with tape or rubber bands, and placing it at your lower back as a lumbar cushion to "keep the back in its natural curve." Allread also notes that companies are beginning to introduce different chair sizes, supporting a wider range of body sizes, which is an important consideration if you're shopping for a new ergonomic chair with the best seat height and seat depth.
"One mistake people make is they say, 'Well, if I get a great chair, then I'm not going to be sore anymore,' and that's not really looking at the big picture of what it takes to keep people comfortable and productive at their jobs," Allread says. A new chair is just one of many things that can make your work environment more comfortable -- so let's keep that in mind as we weigh our options for the best one.    How we test office chairs
Like everything we test here at CNET, these office chairs have undergone a barrage of tests. First, we assembled each chair and noted any issues with the process, including how long it should take versus how long it actually took. Then we spent two workdays, or about 16 hours, sitting in each chair, noting the level of comfort, adjustability (such as adjustable height, adjustable backrest or adjustable arm features) and any issues we had.
We also tested what I like to call the "wibble wobbles." Because office chairs are often supported by just one rod, they can wobble left and right. That movement is more stressful on the chair, which can wear it out more quickly. It can also cause discomfort and even motion sickness.
I'm heavier and taller than average at 6 feet, 1 inch and weigh 270 pounds, so your experience may differ from mine. I get my family to try the chairs out as well. They range from my height and weight down to 5 feet, 4 inches and 130 pounds. Because of the variety of human beings sitting in office chairs, I asked our professional four questions you should consider when choosing your own chair. They are:Was the chair designed so you can rest comfortably against the back of the chair?Do your feet touch the floor with your back against the back of the chair? Did you find yourself fidgeting or standing up a lot? Did you experience any pain or discomfort while using a particular chair?We let these questions guide us, and they helped eliminate a lot of chairs. Some felt OK, but in the long run, they didn't offer the advantages of the ones we ultimately chose.
Office chair FAQs
How do you clean an office chair?
How you clean your office chair will vary depending on its materials. The chair's user manual should detail cleaning and general maintenance tips. If you tossed the paper version, check online. Many retailers provide digital versions or downloadable PDFs of their product manuals.Most chairs should be fine to clean with a damp cloth and mild soap or detergent. Test a small area first and stay away from strong chemical cleaners.
What's the difference between a task chair and an executive chair?
There are two major differences between a task chair and an executive chair, but before we talk about them, let's define the terms.Task Chair: A task chair is any office chair designed specifically for working a long day at your desk, working on a project or doing homework. They tend to be lighter than executive chairs, but are designed with ergonomics and comfort in mind. Lumbar support and adjustable arms are key factors in a good task chair.Executive Chair: An executive chair relies less on ergonomics and more on padding to keep the comfort level high. They tend to be larger than task chairs with padded backs rather than mesh and stationary armrests. An executive chair is not always designed to let you work with your head down all day, but rather to be comfortable in meetings, whether in real life or on Zoom, and to offer support where needed.
How do I make an office chair more comfortable?
Many office chairs are adjustable. You can change the chair height and move the arms, and some office chairs have adjustable lumbar support. Before tossing your current chair, make sure you're sitting optimally by trying out different positions.I cover ergonomics above. Allread, the expert I spoke with, has two main suggestions:You want your back to touch the back of the chair.You want your feet to touch the floor (or you should use a box or footrest to prop up your feet). Allread also suggests rolling up a towel to use for lower back support if your chair doesn't have lumbar support.
How do I fix a squeaky office chair?
When dealing with squeaky office chairs, identify the source of the sound. Double-check that all screws are tight and that the chair is clean and oiled. You might also need to replace a spring. Some retailers sell replacement parts if a loose or old spring ends up being the culprit.
