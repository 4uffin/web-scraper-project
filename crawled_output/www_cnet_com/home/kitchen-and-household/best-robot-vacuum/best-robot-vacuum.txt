How we test
What to consider
Overall performance
Consider how efficient the robot vacuum is at removing dirt and debris.
Type of flooring you have
Note the type of flooring you have as some robot vacuums perform better on hardwood floors while others are optimized for carpet.
Pets or no pets?
Some robot vacuums are more proficient at removing pet hair and some can even detect and avoid pet waste.
Size and power
Consider the size of your home and individual rooms before choosing a robot vacuum, and pick one with enough power to handle the area.
Price
Establish how much you have to spend on a robot vacuum since they're available in a wide range of prices.

Back to selection
No matter how big or small your home is, cleaning is often an unpleasant and time-consuming chore, even if you have a good vacuum cleaner. That's what makes robot vacuums a game-changer. Although it's not the most affordable option when compared with a cordless vacuum, new technology showcased at IFA 2025 is making robot vacuums more capable than ever, with the ability to climb a full flight of stairs, robotic arms that can grasp objects, better navigation and object recognition, and automatic refilling and emptying for their base stations.

Keeping your robot vacuum clean
With consumer prices still high due to the current tariff environment, you have to spend more to get home appliances, so we're always looking for good budget picks and ways to save money on the more premium models. To pick the best robot vacuum machines, we performed hands-on lab testing on nearly 100 models, thoroughly evaluating each on its mopping and carpet performance, how well it avoided obstacles (including pet messes), docking stations, sensors, battery life, reliability and the overall value. Here are our top 10 favorites.What is the best overall robot vacuum? The Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo remains in our top spot on the best robot vacuums list, despite stiffening competition. Honorable mention also goes to the Yeedi M12 Pro Plus, one of the best robot vacuum and mop combos we've tested for hardwood floors and a great value -- on sale or not. We loved the Ecovacs Deebot T30S Comboself-emptying dustbin, mop function, efficient navigation and cost-to-value ratio. You can choose between the all-in-one combo, which includes a stick vacuum that also self-empties, or just the robot vacuum. It has a new competitor in the Eufy E20 3-in-1, which offers a robot vacuum, stick vacuum and handheld vacuum in one unit. Still, it lacks mopping capability and doesn't have the same level of cleaning performance. Best 10 robot vacuums of 2025Filter by

Best robot vacuum overall
Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Self-emptying robot vac and stick vac in one
Excellent performance on hardwood (85% sand pickup)
Pet hair doesn't get tangled on the brush
Supports mopping
Cons
Pricey at $1,200
Not the strongest carpet performance we've seen at 65% average pickup
Best for: Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo may look like a gimmick, adding a cordless stick vac to the Omni Station. Our lab testing shows that this is not the case. Instead, the Deebot T30S is so good as a robot vacuum and stick vacuum that it has become our top recommendation. It's a great option for people who want a robot vacuum and stick vacuum in one unit without compromising performance. It offers strong performance on both hardwood and carpet, supports mopping and has a self-emptying base station. Why we recommend it: During testing in our lab, the T30S Combo picked up more than 65% of the sand on the carpet (64.44% from low-pile and 66.67% from midpile). Hardwood was even better, with 85% of sand pickup on the hardwood. It does a fantastic job getting debris off the floor; it’s also great for pet hair with the ZeroTangle brush system, which uses a V-shaped roller and Dual Comb Teeth to physically scrape hair from the brush and direct it to the dust bin. In our testing, it did a great job of tackling pet hair. The stick vac accessory has many attachments you need to help clean any mess. It’s great to have a stick vac with your robot vacuum and what helps the system stand out is that the Omni Station empties and cleans the robot vacuum and the stick vac. The Deebot T30S Combo offers a dual-spinning mop brush system to help keep your hard floors clean. When the vacuum detects the carpet, the mop rises to avoid touching the fibers. When mopping, the brush can swing out to reach the edge of the wall.Who shouldn't get it: If you're price sensitive, at $1,200 it's not the cheapest option, but it's less than newer releases from Dreame and Roborock. If you think about it, you're also getting a cordless stick vacuum and robot vacuum and mop in one device.If you can find it on sale, I wouldn't hesitate.

Best value robot vacuum
Eufy 3-in-1 E20
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Very easy to use
Flexible and customizable for your cleaning needs with multiple attachments
Strong vacuum performance on hardwood with 72% pickup
Great value at $549 full price and often on sale
Cons
No mopping functionality
Could be better on carpet, scores under 50% on low-pile and mid-pile
Best for: The Eufy E20 3-in-1 robot vacuum is one of the most distinct robovacs we've tested. It's similar to our best overall pick, the Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo, which comes with a detachable and very capable stick vacuum in addition to its vacuuming and mopping robovac. The E20 doesn't have mopping capabilities, but it's still a very capable and easy-to-use robot vacuum and cordless vacuum. We like it for the total flexibility it offers by giving you a robovac, handheld and stick vac in one unit with a solid performance on different floor types.Why we recommend it:"This is my favorite robot vacuum," said our lab tech, Schylar Breitenstein, who spent hours testing the Eufy E20 both in the lab and at home. She praised its ease of use and how the portable vacuum fits into the robot vacuum's body for space savings. She also pointed to the numerous attachments included to customize the E20 for different cleaning needs. In terms of performance, the E20 did quite well in our sand pickup test on a hardwood floor, removing 72% of sand. It struggled a bit more with carpet, falling shy of the 50% we consider a good score at 41% for low- and midpile carpet. Navigation was a mixed bag. Our light path test shows that it cleaned the test room in a methodical fashion, especially focusing on getting the corners first. However, it notably missed spots when navigating around the multi-legged table and would have benefited from a tighter turn. It handled pet hair well on hardwood floors but missed some clumps on the carpet.However, what earns the E20 a place on our list is the sheer value it offers. It's $549 at full price, but as of this writing, it's on sale for $350. For the price, you get a robot vacuum with a self-emptying dock, a stick vacuum, and a handheld vacuum all in one, where normally you'd need to buy them separately. Its closest competitor with the same features, the Deebot T30S Combo, will cost you more than double this price, giving the E20 tremendous value.Who shouldn't get it: If you have a lot of carpeting at home, the E20 didn't do the best, scoring 41% for low- and midpile carpet. For a robot vacuum that can tackle carpet and hardwood equally well, we still like our best overall, the Ecovacs Deebot T30S Combo for its stronger scores on both hardwood and carpet, as well as the ability to serve as both a cordless vacuum and robot vacuum.

Best robot vacuum and mop combo and runner-up best value
Yeedi M12 Pro Plus
8.6
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent performance on hardwood (96.5%) and strong midpile carpet performance (64%)
Very reasonable price
Great for pet hair
Good navigation around obstacles
Includes self-emptying dock and mopping capability
Cons
Low-pile carpet performance could be better at 54.6%
Some user complaints about the app and setup
Best for:The Yeedi M12 Pro Plus offers the best bang for the buck among the robot vacuums we've tested. It's specifically great for those who want vacuuming and mopping functionality and have a lot of hardwood floors. It's also really good at tackling pet hair. It also includes a docking station to charge, self-empty and supports mopping. Why we recommend it:Yeedi may not be a brand you've heard of, but it's actually a sister company of Ecovacs, which has earned a number of picks on our list over the years. The Yeedi M12 Pro Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop that comes with a docking station and very impressive performance on hardwood floors. It scored an impressive 96.5% sand removal from hardwood floors, even higher than Deebot T30S Combo (85%). In fact, this is the highest score on hardwood of any robot vacuum we've tested. It also managed 54.6% from low-pile carpet and 64% from midpile carpet.According to our light path test, navigation was also particularly impressive. The robot kept a very tight path around our complicated table setup, hit the corners well, and missed very few spots. Notably, it also supports multi-level mopping, which is a nice feature you don't always get on non-flagship vacuums. Pet hair also proved not to be a problem, with the M12 Pro Plus picking up nearly all the pet hair from hardwood and carpet.The base station and robot vacuum are both loaded with features. The dock self-empties and includes a water tank to refill during mopping. It also has built-in hot air drying to sanitize the mopping pad between cleanings. And speaking of the mop, like many new robot vacuums, the M12 Pro Plus will lift up its mopping pad if it encounters carpet. The mopping pad is even pressurized, giving you a bit more elbow grease when cleaning. The Yeedi M12 Pro Plus costs $900 at full price, which puts it on par with the Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro, but it's currently priced at $380 on Yeedi and Amazon, making it quite the steal for the performance.Who shouldn't get it:The M12 Pro Plus doesn't have many shortfalls, but low-pile carpet performance is on the lower side compared to some top-tier competitors like the T30S Combo. If you need stronger carpet performance, we're partial to the Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni, which is still being tested in the lab, but delivered impressive carpet pickup of more than 70% on both types of carpet. Some people have also complained about the confusing app, though that tends to be a pretty common problem in robot vacuums.  ... Show more

8.0
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent performance on hardwood floors with 96% sand pickup
Good carpet cleaning performance at above 50% pickup
Comes with self-emptying dock
Can cross obstacles up to 1.5 inches
Cons
Somewhat pricey without sales
Takes 21 minutes for a single room
Best for: Together with Roomba and Dyson, Shark is one of the best-known vacuum brands. In recent years, they've faced stiff competition from Dreame, Eufy, Eureka, Roborock and others, which are incorporating innovative features like threshold crossing, self-emptying docks and detangling brush rollers. The PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro is Shark's answer to this. It gives you good vacuuming and mopping with great navigation and the ability to cross thresholds up to 1.5 inches without having to spend as much as the Dreame X50 Ultra. If you love Shark as a brand, the PowerDetect Never Touch Pro is the robot you want. Why we recommend it: It comes with all the key features we've come to expect from a modern robot vacuum, including vacuuming and mopping functionality, a self-emptying dock, improved navigation with 3D mapping, 360-degree lidar and dirt detection sensors. In lab testing, it did great picking up sand from hardwood floors, removing nearly 96%, which is one of our highest scores on a robot vacuum. With carpet, we consider anything above 50% to be good; the Shark managed 54.5% from low-pile and 53% from midpile. Pet hair also proved not to be a challenge, with the PowerDetect removing most of it from hardwood and carpet. Navigation was also quite good, with the robot moving around our test room in 21 minutes. The cleaning time is a little higher than some other models, but it was comprehensive, hitting most of the edges and navigating under a multi-legged table. It missed only a few spots in its passes. Notably, similar to the Dreame X50 Ultra, the PowerDetect is able to lift itself up over thresholds and obstacles up to 1.5 inches, although it can't go as high as the 2.36 inches of the X50 Ultra. The mopping pads also lift up so they won't drag across the carpet, and they self-clean and dry. Who shouldn't get it: At $999 at full price, it's one of the pricier robot vacuums on our list, but it's frequently on sale, making it a much more attractive option. If you can't find it on sale, we generally like the Yeedi M12 Pro Plus for offering better bang for the buck with the same capabilities.

Best robot vacuum under $500
iRobot Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo
7.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Good price at $479 MSRP and $270 on sale
Solid sand removal on hardwood (82%) and above 50% on carpet
Small robot and base station won't take up too much space
Can mop and vacuum
Mechanical paddle helps optimize dustbin space
Cons
No auto refill water tank
No mopping settings or customization options in the app
Best for:The Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo is our favorite new midprice robot vacuum at $470 full price and a relative newcomer from iRobot. It offers strong suction on both hard flooring and carpet, supports mopping, and has a unique mechanical paddle that compresses debris in the dustbin to let you keep 60 days' worth of dirt in the robot vacuum at a time. Why we recommend it: The 205 DustCompactor Combo gives you everything you need in a surprisingly small form factor. Our lab technician, Schylar Breitenstein, noted that the entire unit, including the docking station, is very small, making it a good option for people in apartments or small homes. In terms of performance, it did well in all of our tests, scoring 82% sand pickup from hard flooring, which makes it nearly as good as some of our top picks like the Deebot T30S Combo. On carpet, we consider anything above 50% to be good, and the 205 didn't disappoint, scoring 55% on mid-pile carpet and 59.5% on low-pile carpet. It also mops, though strangely, the mopping settings are not available in the app. Despite that, it still worked perfectly, taking about 30 minutes to clean our test area and removing all stickiness from the floor after the first cleaning cycle. Who shouldn't get it:Despite having a base station for charging, the 205 DustCompactor does not self-empty or self-refill its water tank, so you'll still need to do that manually. If this is a deal breaker, many robot vacuums on our list have this feature, like the Dreame X40 and X50 Ultra, Yeedi M12 Pro Plus, and others, but they'll cost you significantly more.

Best for obstacles and pets
Dreame X50 Ultra
6.4
/10
SCORE
Pros
Can cross thresholds and obstacles up to 2.36 inches
Good hardwood floor cleaning (62%)
Good obstacle recognition and avoidance
Cons
Struggles for sand pickup from low-pile and midpile carpet scoring under 50% for both
Very expensive at $1,600
Best for: One of the biggest problems I face using a robot vacuum in my apartment is the different height thresholds between rooms, which make it impossible for most robot vacuums to handle. The Dreame X50 Ultra is a robot vacuum designed to solve this problem. It can cross thresholds and obstacles up to 2.36 inches by deploying a pair of small legs to lever itself over obstacles. It offers solid vacuum performance on hardwood and can mop your floors, too. Why we recommend it: In our lab testing, it successfully climbed a stack of plywood up to 2.36 inches, although it faced some issues coming down from anything more than 1.5 inches. Dreame advises that it works best when there's a transition between the two vertical obstacles, such as a 1.65-inch threshold followed by a 0.7-inch threshold. It's still more capable of climbing obstacles than any other robot vacuum we've tested, earning it a place on our list. In cleaning capabilities, it's no slouch either. In lab testing, it vacuumed a room in 23.6 minutes and removed 62% of sand from a hardwood floor. For reference, we consider anything above 50% to be good. Carpets proved more of a challenge, with 35% off low-pile and 44% off midpile. Mopping functionality is also quite good. Our lab engineer took it to his home and tested the mopping and vacuuming on his 1,200-square-foot main floor. It mapped the main level in 11 minutes and cleaned everything in a little more than 2 hours. The base station also comes with two tanks, one for clean water and one for dirty water, along with another receiver for the cleaning solution. In real-world testing, it worked great with pet hair, removing most, if not all, of the pet hair from hardwood and carpet. The tangle-free roller brush never got tangled in a household with a Great Pyrenees. Navigation was also quite good, with the X50 Ultra able to identify objects like shoes, socks, tennis balls, electrical cords and other items it might get stuck on. It also recognized and worked around pets. Who shouldn't get it: The strong navigation abilities and good suction of pet hair earn it our recommendation. However, at $1,699 at full price, it is one of the most expensive robot vacuums you can buy, so we only recommend it if you truly have numerous thresholds and challenging transition strips in your home. For a robot vacuum that offers this capability at a lower price, the Shark PowerDetect Never Touch Pro can manage thresholds up to 1.5 inches.

Best Roomba and best hardwood
iRobot Roomba Combo J7 Plus
8.7
/10
SCORE
Pros
Picked up 100% of sand from hardwood during pickup test
Strong carpet pickup at 61.9% low-pile and 60% from mid-pile
Motorized mopping
Good at identifying carpeted versus hardwood areas
Cons
No water tank for mopping
Somewhat outdated navigation compared with lidar on newer robot vacuums
Best for: The Roomba J7 Plus is a very capable and reasonably price robot vacuum, but it lacks mopping functionality. Enter the Roomba Combo J7 Plus, which adds mopping to its skillset. Rather than just slapping a mopping pad onto the bottom, iRobot designed a motorized mopping pad with arms that lift it out from the bottom of the cleaner and relocate it to the top whenever it detects it's traveling over carpets. It offers strong hardwood scores, with an impressive 100% pickup, good carpet scores at 61.9% on low-pile and nearly 60% on midpile.Why we recommend it: It's a capable vacuum, and it did great at tackling all three flooring types (hardwood, low-pile carpet and midpile carpet) we tested. However, it faces stiffer competition these days with new combo robot vacuums that incorporate water tanks into their base stations and come with features like self-detangling rollers and hot air drying. Navigation also leaves something to be desired compared with lidar-based cleaners from names like Dreame, Neato and Roborock. Our lab tech took the Roomba Combo J7 Plus home, where they have a mix of carpets and hardwood floors. It did a great job of identifying carpeted areas during its initial mapping run. We never caught it vacuuming those carpeted areas without lifting the mop up and out of the way first. It's just a better, more high-end approach to automated mopping and one you won't need to think about quite as much.Despite some downsides, the Combo J7 Plus is typically priced at $589 these days and offers strong overall cleaning performance. As a result, it's our pick for the best Roomba robovac you can get. Who shouldn't get it: Despite strong performance scores, the Combo J7 Plus is showing its age in the navigation tech. It lacks lidar and more advanced sensors, so you're likely to get better, more comprehensive coverage with some of the newer models we recommend, like the Dreame X50 Ultra.

Best budget pick
Eufy RoboVac 25C
8.2
/10
SCORE
Pros
Impressive hardwood performance at 78.9% sand pickup
Managed to score higher than 50% on both types of carpet
Budget-friendly at $115
Cons
No real navigation system
Very slow at cleaning, took 91 minutes for one room
Best for:For those on a very tight budget, the Eufy RoboVac 25C is one of the only robot vacuums available for around $100-150. Despite the cut-rate price, you get surprisingly good performance on hardwood floors and solid carpet pickup performance. Why we recommend it: You might not expect sufficient cleaning power from a budget-priced robot vacuum, but that's precisely what the Anker Eufy RoboVac 25C delivers. For instance, its ability to scour sand from hardwood floors (78.9%) wasn't too far below that of our top midrange pick. It's a decent performer on low- and midpile carpets as well, sucking up averages of 54% and 52% of sand from them, respectively. The current asking price is just $150 at Walmart, although stock is dwindling at other retailers.Who shouldn't get it:How did Anker cut down on costs here, anyway? The answer is navigation. Instead of relying on cameras or lasers to map out its environment, the machine bumps around the floor like a slow-motion ping-pong ball, changing direction when it encounters an object or obstacle. As a result, it took an excessive 91 minutes to finish its cleaning cycle in our test room, so don't expect it to cover your house in anything close to an efficient fashion. If you don't like this trade-off.

Roborock Saros Z70
6.3
/10
SCORE
Pros
Good vacuuming on hardwood
Very low profile and fits under pretty much everything
Quiet operation
Works well with pets
The chassis lift prevents it from getting stuck most of the time
Cons
Dust and water tank are too small
Mopping performance isn't great
Obstacle avoidance needs some improvement
Expensive at $2,600 at full price
Robot arm is neat, but only useful in limited circumstances
Best for: If money is no object and you want a robot vacuum that's capable of crossing thresholds and obstacles like the Dreame X50 Ultra, with the added benefit of a robotic arm to help you sort items, the Saros Z70 is for you. It offers decent vacuum performance, mopping capabilities, and comes with a self-emptying and auto-refilling base station. It's certainly the most unique robot vacuum I've ever used and one of the few that worked well in my challenging apartment that has multiple large thresholds between rooms and lots of clutter caused by three cats.Why we recommend it: The Saros Z70's main selling point is the mechanical arm, which can pick up and sort small objects like crumpled papers, napkins, slippers, and shoes. It's neat seeing the arm automatically emerge from the robot vacuum's body to do some pickup. It's fairly easy to designate a sorting zone in the app and the arm will usually put things where it's told to, but to be frank, the arm is hit and miss. It's capable of recognizing the objects it's trained for, but things like pet toys it usually wasn't able to pick up, though that's something Roborock is working on and that potential makes it a robot vacuum worth watching. "The arm is a neat feature to watch, but I personally don't find it very useful," said Jared Hannah, senior technical project manager at our Louisville testing lab who was using the Saros Z70 at the same time as me. " I feel like if the robot is smart enough to avoid obstacles such as shoes and socks, I don't need it to try and pick them up and move them. As long as the robot doesn't get stuck on anything during its cleaning cycle, that's good enough for me."In other capabilities, the Saros Z70 isn't too shabby. It has great sand pickup on hardwood floors, scoring 82.5% sand pickup, just short of our best overall, the T30S XCombo. On mid-pile carpet, it does better than the Dreame X50 Ultra, at 52%. On low-pile, it's at 51%, which is pretty solid and not too far off the Shark Power Detect NeverTouch Pro. It also has key functionality we expect from a robot vacuum, including a self-emptying and self-refilling docking station and advanced navigation. I was also personally impressed by the mapping. After an initial quick scan, the robot did a great job of generating a layout of my apartment, identifying flooring types, key pieces of furniture, pet areas and cords. Tagging things manually was also fairly straightforward, though if I have one gripe, it's that the app is a bit overwhelming in terms of settings and customization options. For me, the AdaptLift chassis was the real lifesaver. Like the Dreame X50 Ultra, it can deploy a pair of legs to lever itself over obstacles. It's one of the few robot vacuums that have been able to cross the two-inch thresholds in my apartment. Who shouldn't get it: Price is obviously the sticking point here. At $2,600, it's the single most expensive robot vacuum on this list and it's possible to get superior cleaning performance for a fraction of what you'll pay for the Z70. If the lift system is something that's important to you, you can get a similar feature from the Dreame X50 Ultra for about half the price. The dustbin and water tank are also on the small side due to all the space taken up by the arm, so that's another thing to consider.

Most consistent performance across flooring types and best for carpet
Dreame X40 Ultra
8.5
/10
SCORE
Pros
Excellent hardwood pickup at 95%
Strong low-pile (90%) and mid-pile (86%) carpet pickup
Includes self-emptying docking station
Supports mopping
Good obstacle recognition
Cons
Still expensive at full price despite being older generation
Superseded by newer model, the X50 Ultra
Best for:Not so long ago, the Dreame X40 Ultra was our splurge choice. Priced at $1,500, it was one of the most expensive robot vacuums we recommended for its excellent obstacle recognition and ability to clean multiple floor types. However, it's been replaced by a successor, the Dreame X50 Ultra, which is capable of overcoming vertical obstacles. That means the X40 Ultra is now often available for significantly less (currently $700 on sale), making it a much better deal, taking into account its excellent performance across flooring types. Why we recommend it:The X40 Ultra scored some of the highest sand pickup scores of any robot vacuum, with 95% sand pickup from hardwood and 90% from low-pile carpet and 86% from mid-pile.These are some of the highest scores of any robot vacuum we've tested on these flooring types. It even outstrips our best overall, the T30S Combo.Despite being a generation older than the X50 Ultra, it still has most of the key features you want in a higher-end robot vacuum, including an all-in-one base station that can self-empty and auto-refill, 3D structured light navigation, advanced obstacle recognition, a swing arm for edge cleaning, multi-level mapping and hot water mopping.Who shouldn't get it: The X40 Ultra is a great robot vacuum, but it's an older generation model, so availability may start to dwindle over time. For now, though, it's an excellent choice as long as it remains on sale for around $700 to $800. If the price rises back to full price, then there are better options available, including the versatile T30S Combo and relatively affordable Yeedi M12 Pro Plus.

April 2025: We added new tested robot vacuum and mop recommendations to the list: the Yeedi C12 Plus, Dreame X50 Ultra, Eufy 3-in-1 E20, Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro and Yeedi M12 Pro Plus. Eliminated our test for black rice because every robot vacuum was hitting nearly 100%. Instead, we've re-weighted our scoring using just sand on three different test surfaces.June 2025: Reworked product entries of all the robot vacuums we recommend to provide additional guidance on why we recommend them and who shouldn't buy them. We also added other robot vacuums we tested and some new infographics that compare robot vacuums.July 2025: Added the iRobot Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo as our new pick under $500, the Roborock Saros Z70 as the best splurge, and the Dreame X40 as the most consistent. We also updated our other robot vacuums we tested with new products and results.August 2025: Added new test results for the Deebot X9 Pro Omni and T80 Omni. Added an explanation of how we test average runtime.September 2025: Added a new section covering developments in the robot vacuum industry and details on new robovacs currently being tested in the lab. What's new with robot vacuums in 2025?
Exciting things are happening in the robot vacuum industry. Between CES 2025 and IFA 2025, we've seen dozens of new robot vacuums released, incorporating new technologies that allow them to clean and navigate spaces more effectively than ever before.
Andrew Gebhart, our colleague at CNET's sister site PCMag, was able to see a live demo of the Marswalker taking on stairs. Andrew Gebhart/PCMagThe biggest changes that are coming are the arrival of genuine stair-climbing robots with the Eufy Marswalker and Dreame Cyber X, both of which vaguely resemble a space rover, allowing them to use treads to climb up stairs. Both appear to be semi-autonomous shells that can work with an existing robot vacuum, with the Marswalker confirmed to be compatible with the Eufy Omni S2. The Cyber X is more of a proof of concept, but it shows that many companies are working to tackle "the stair problem" for robot vacuums, and we expect to see the first consumer versions in 2026.
Gebhart also got to see the Cyber X in action, watching the robot climb stairs. Andrew Gebhart/PCMagDreame is also joining Roborock in creating an arm-equipped robot vacuum, with the Cyber10 Ultra intended to rival the Saros Z70. Like the Z70, it can sort items and pick up after you.
PCMag's Gebhart watched the Cyber10 Ultra pick up and move a sock. Andrew Gebhart/PCMagLess eye-catching, but no less important, is Ecovacs' new Deebot X11 Pro Omnicyclone. It's the first robot vacuum with four-wheel drive and gallium nitride fast charging. AWD should give it better stability and obstacle crossing, while the fast-charging capabilities should let it quickly top up while docked, resulting in shorter cleaning cycles.
The X11 Pro Omni should be able to recharge enough during a quick mop cleaning session to continue its cleaning cycle. EcovacsA lesser-known offering comes from Mova, a sub-brand of Dreame, with the Z60 Ultra Roller Complete. It has 28,000 Pascals of suction, real-time mop washing, and a roller mop that should handle cleaning better than spinning mop pads. It's currently being tested in the lab together with the Mova V50, with our test results and insights coming soon. Also being tested in the lab is the unique SwitchBot S20, a robot vacuum that comes with a water hookup similar to a washing machine. This hookup lets the vacuum automatically refill and drain its water tanks. This is part of an ongoing trend to make robot vacuums completely hands-free and self-maintained. We're also testing the more affordable K11 Plus and should have testing results and insights for both models soon.
Factors to consider when choosing a robot vacuum
BudgetBefore you do anything else, make sure you're clear on what you want to spend on your new vacuum. Robot vacuum models can cost anywhere from $200 to nearly $2,000, so it's important to set a budget to prevent overspending. We recommend deciding on what features (self-emptying bins, built-in mopping capabilities and advanced AI image recognition for elite-level obstacle avoidance) fit your needs and researching what your budget can get you. That way you know what you're looking for and can ensure you're getting the best value. Navigation and obstacle detection Sure, many robot vacuum models have sensors to navigate around your home or apartment but how effectively do the sensors perform? The ability of a robot vac to detect objects in its path can mean the difference between returning home to a clean house and a situation where the robot is trapped on cords or an area rug. Certain models like the Dreame L40 and Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro have powerful obstacle detection capabilities and navigate your home with efficiency. Many new and upcoming robovacs also incorporate AI object recognition, allowing them to recognize objects intelligently and learn about new objects over time. This is true of the Dreame X50 Ultra and Roborock Saros Z70 and Ecovacs T50 Pro Omni, among others. Pets Is there anything worse than your vacuum roller brush getting all tangled up and clogged by a heap of pet hair? Luckily, many manufacturers make robot vacuums that are suited for cleaning up after pets. Models like the Dreame X50 Ultra and the Yeedi M12 Plus Pro are adept at sucking up pet hair on carpet and hardwood flooring as well as detecting (and avoiding) pet waste. Several of the models on this list have high-efficiency filters to help eliminate allergens that may come from pet hair and dander to help with allergies. One of the best new innovations is self-detangling brush rollers that are designed to avoid getting clogged by pet hair.
How we test robot vacuums
Each robot vacuum we consider for recommendation gets put through its paces in our test lab in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to test floors where we run our controlled pickup tests, we monitor each robot vacuum in a special test room filled with mock furniture to gauge how well it navigates around common obstacles. Past that, we check each robot vacuum's ability to gobble up pet hair without getting clogged or leaving loose strands behind, we consider mopping capabilities, and we check to see how well it navigates fake dog messes too. Let's dive a little deeper into the main considerations, starting with our performance tests.
Robot vacuum pickup powerWhen it comes to vacuuming prowess, we want to know how effective each robot is against common crumbs and other debris, and also how it fares against much smaller particles like dust, dirt and sand. To find out, we use sand as an analog for finer particles. In each case, we scatter a controlled amount across three test floors: low-pile carpet, midpile carpet and hardwood floors. Low-pile carpet is shorter, less plush carpet with shorter fibers, so typically robot vacuums have an easier time picking up from it (though not always). Midpile is softer, more plush carpet with taller fibers. It tends to be more challenging for robot vacuums (though again, not always). Then, we take the robot vacuum, thoroughly empty its dust bin, send it to clean the affected area and finally measure the weight of whatever it managed to pick up. That gives us a pickup percentage of the full amount. From there, we repeat each run two more times and average the results. In recent months, we eliminated our test for black rice on hardwood floors since, more or less, every robot vacuum we tested was scoring near 100%. We now use the sand test as our primary benchmark in evaluating cleaning performance. We consider anything 50% and above to be a good score for sand. Robot vacuum navigation skills Your robot vacuum will only clean your home as thoroughly as it's capable of navigating it. The ideal cleaner will make easy work of finding its way from room to room and automatically avoiding obstacles along the way, all of which makes for proper, low-maintenance automated cleaning. We make sure to observe each robot vacuum as it cleans to get a good sense of how well it navigates but to get the best comparison from cleaner to cleaner, we take overhead long exposure shots of each one as it cleans our darkened test room, with glow sticks attached to the top of each one directly above the vacuum intake. The images that result show us light trails that reveal the robot's path as it navigates the room and cleans around our mock furniture. Below is an example from the Ecovacs Deebot T30S, our best overall. It offers superb area coverage and it carried out navigation in a very organized and efficient manner. It got a 10 out of 10 in the navigation score, only taking an average of 15 minutes to complete a full-cleaning cycle.
CNET LabsIn contrast, we have a robot vacuum with bad navigation, the Noesis Florio. It missed several spots in the room, and the light path test image contains a couple of brighter spots, potentially indicating the robot vacuum spent time spinning in place. What's notable is the very disorganized navigation pattern. All this resulted in poor navigation scores.
CNET LabsIn large part, it comes down to the tech at play. Over the years, we've consistently noted that robot vacuums that use laser-guided lidar navigation tend to be very good at mapping their environment and finding their way around. Meanwhile, 3D-mapping cameras with object recognition smarts can give robot vacuums the extra ability to identify and adapt to obstacles in their path.
RoborockAverage runtimeTo measure robot vacuum runtime, we run the vacuum in our test room three times and take the average of the times it takes to complete its cleaning cycle. To be clear, we do not run the vacuum until it's drained, since unlike cordless vacuums, a robot vacuum will stop when it believes cleaning has been completed. Generally, we consider anything below 20 minutes to be a fast runtime. Robot vacuum mopping testingWe test mopping on all the robot vacuums that have the functionality. We run the mopping test at least two or three times and evaluate its ability to remove sticky messes from different types of flooring. We're currently in the process of formalizing our testing procedures in a quantifiable manner, but as of this writing our evaluation of mopping capabilities is anecdotal.
Other robot vacuum products we've tested
You've seen our top picks and our test data. Now, here's a quick rundown of the rest of the robot vacuums we've tested in recent years, some of which are still worthy of consideration for some shoppers: 3i3i S10 Ultra: We haven't reviewed many robot vacuums from 3i, but the company has some unique offerings like the S10 Ultra, which it claims is the first water recycling robot vacuum in the world. What that means is that it's capable of purifying and distilling its own wastewater extracted from the robot, as well as utilizing water vapor and condensation from the air to refill the robot's water tank with clean water. It's a fascinating implementation that can help cut down on how much water gets wasted on mopping. In terms of performance, the S10 Ultra is a capable robot vacuum, removing 85% of sand from hard flooring, 54% from low-pile carpet and almost 50% from mid-pile carpet. It has all the key features you'd expect from a higher-end robot vacuum, including advanced lidar navigation, dirt and liquid detection, a self-cleaning spinning roller mop and AI obstacle avoidance. Our lab technician, Schylar Breitenstein, noted that the app wasn't very user-friendly, but it does work at saving maps quickly, and the robot worked to execute tasks without being prompted. In our mopping test, we had some issues with the robot continuing to clean even after the app claimed cleaning was completed, and the floor was still somewhat sticky after our cleaning session. Despite the mopping and app issues, the overall suction performance still puts it among the higher tier of robot vacuums, but that also means it'll cost you $1,900 at full price, though it's currently on sale for $1,300. The relatively high price puts it close to our most expensive picks like the Dreame X50 Ultra and Roborock Saros Z70, which keeps it narrowly off our primary list since the water recycling is a relatively niche feature compared to the X50 Ultra's ability to overcome obstacles and the Z70's unique robotic arm that can sort items. However, if you can get it on sale, it's definitely worth considering if water usage is a big concern.3i P10 Ultra: The P10 Ultra is 3i's more traditional robot vacuum and mop offering and it comes in at a lower starting price, starting at $1,100 at full price and $700 on sale as of this writing. In terms of performance, it's just shy of the S10 Ultra, picking up 75% of sand from hard flooring, around 49% from low-pile carpet and 52% from mid-pile carpet. It also has many of the key features you'd expect, including an all-in-one base station that can self-empty and automatically dry the mop, 70 days of dust storage, lidar navigation and 3D scanning, an AI camera for obstacle avoidance that can recognize 100+ objects and messes and anti-tangle brushes. Our lab tech noted some issues, though. When opening the dustbin, all the debris fell out, and there was some significant lag when using the app. Perhaps most notably, on the mid-pile pet hair carpet test, we found hair wrapped around the bristle roller that had to be manually pulled out. It's a good option if you can get it for sale, offering suction performance similar to the Eufy E20 on hard flooring and carpet, though it lacks the flexibility of Eufy's unique 3-in-1 design.DreameDreametech DreameBot L10S Ultra: A souped-up Dreametech model that typically costs around $500, the DreameBot L10S Ultra adds a king-size, 3L self-emptying bin and self-filling water tanks that let the thing make multiple mopping runs before needing a refill. It was only a so-so performer in our cleaning tests, getting regularly outperformed by its smaller sibling, the top-rated DreameBot D10 Plus. That model doesn't have the self-filling water tank, but at several hundred dollars less than the L10S Ultra, it's a much better buy.Dreame L40 Ultra: The L40 Ultra is a capable robot vacuum that performed well at picking up sand from hardwood floor (95%) as well as low-pile (63%) and midpile (62%) carpet. Navigation was also impressive, with tight corners and no missed spots. However, at $1,499 at full price, it's one of the more expensive robot vacuums on the market, so we don't recommend it unless you can find it on sale for closer to $1,000.Dreametech DreameBot D10S Plus: A newer, slightly fancier version of our top-recommended DreameBot D10 Plus, the DreameBot D10S Plus (emphasis mine) added in a slightly larger bin that won't need to be emptied quite as much, a slight bump in suction power and a sleek, black-bodied design, all for about a hundred bucks more than the regular D10 Plus. It was a bit better on thin, low-pile carpet than that top-rated cleaner, but not quite as good on hardwood floors or midpile carpet, which was somewhat surprising. Unless the bigger bin is of particular interest, we think you're better off saving some money and sticking with the D10 Plus. DreameBot D10 Plus (out of stock): This is the former overall pick, but the aging device is harder to find at retailers. It performs well on both carpets and hardwood floors with lidar navigation and a self-emptying dustbin. It's largely discontinued, but its successor, the Dreame D10 Plus Gen 2 is in stock for around $400 or less with a sale. Its features rival top brands like Roomba and Roborock at a significantly lower cost, making it a good option.EcovacsEcovacs Deebot X2 Omni: Retailing for $1,500 (though typically available for significantly less), this is the fanciest and most expensive Deebot we've danced within our test lab. It vacuums, mops, empties its own bin, refills its own water reservoir and features all of the rest of the bells and whistles that you'd expect from such a costly cleaner. It wasn't a leader in any of our tests, which is disappointing at this price, but it never faltered too badly, either. The pickup percentages on hardwood floors were all decent, and its performance was passable on the carpet too, with more than 50% of the sand sucked up in both our low- and midpile tests.Ecovacs Deebot 500: The Deebot 500 is a basic but competent robot vacuum that offers app controls and voice compatibility with Alexa and Google. It wasn't a strong performer in our carpet tests and is priced too high to count as a budget pick.Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 950 (out of stock): The Ozmo 950 adds mopping functionality to the Deebot mix. As with other Deebots, the cleaning power didn't blow us awayEcovacs Deebot N30 Omni: The N30 Omni is a capable robot vacuum and mop, but it doesn't stand out in performance. It scores decently in our sand removal test from hardwood (58.8%) and did OK at low-pile (46.5%) and midpile (50.4%). At $800, there are robovacs with better performance in this price range.Ecovacs Deebot T50 Max Pro Omni: The T50 Max Pro Omni is another robot vacuum and mop combo targeted toward the higher end of the market. It certainly looks like it, with a premium-felling design and beautiful rose gold accents on the robot vacuum. Setup was It's loaded with features, including a self-emptying dock that can detangle its brushes, advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance, and auto-refill for mopping. Performance is generally good, averaging 61% for sand removal from our three test surfaces. It did the best on hardwood, removing 76.5% of sand and more than 50% from both types of carpet. However, navigation left something to be desired, with numerous missed spots in our testing room, especially when navigating our multi-legged table. Robot vacuums with these features are also increasingly common, and at the $999 price, competition is stiff, which keeps it from taking a spot on our list.Ecovacs Deebot T80 Omni: The $1,000 T80 Omni is another capable robot vacuum and mop from Ecovacs that offers solid performance. It scores 62.75% in our sand pickup test on hardwood, a respectable score, though not as high as some others we've seen. It also did quite well on carpet, scoring 65.12% on low-pile and 64.34% on mid-pile. It took about 21.36 minutes on average to clean our test room, which is relatively standard for the robots we've tested. What keeps it off our main list is that while performance is solid and the T70 Omni is loaded with premium features, including all-in-one base station, a self-cleaning and drying mop, advanced navigation and threshold crossing, it's outperformed by Ecovacs' own T30S Combo. TheEcovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni: The $1,200 X9 Pro Omni is one of the best robot vacuums we've tested on carpet. It scored an impressive 72.87% on low-pile carpet and 75.19% on mid-pile carpet. That puts it among some of the top-tier robot vacuums we've tested in terms of carpet performance. It also does well on hardwood, scoring 70.59%, though we've seen higher scores on other models, including the more affordable Yeedi M12 Pro Plus. As you'd expect from a high-end robot vacuum, it comes with premium features, including advanced navigation, an all-in-one docking station, self-emptying, and a self-washing mop. The only thing that prevents it from earning a spot in our top ten is that the older Dreame X40 Ultra model is currently still in stock and scored better on carpet pickup, but if you want the latest and greatest bells and whistles, you won't go wrong with the X9 Pro Omni.EufyEufy 11S Max: The Eufy 11S Max is a robot vacuum that might have earned our budget pick if the performance held up. However, while this slim robovac does well at sucking up sand from hardwood (71%), it struggled with both low-pile (21%) and mid-pile (27%) carpet. It's $249 at full price, but it may become a more palatable option on sale ($140 as of this writing).Eufy Omni S1 Pro: We were mixed on the S1 Pro. On one hand, our tester loved its fast and efficient cleaning, strong mopping, capable mapping and navigation, and useful self-sterilizing base. However, in lab testing, it didn't quite live up to expectations. While it did excellently on removing sand from hardwood floors, getting 81.5%, it fell short on carpet at 37.8% for low-pile and 38.5% for mid-pile.Eufy Omni E28: The Eufy Omni E28 is another one of Eufy's unique 3-in-1 robot vacuums. Unlike the E20, which incorporated a cordless and handheld vacuum into the robot, the E28 is a portable deep cleaner built into the robot vacuum's base station. The detachable dual water tank (clean and dirty water) doubles as a deep cleaner, complete with a handle and hose attachment that lets you do spot cleaning on various soft surfaces, including carpets and fabric. "At home testing the carpet cleaner, I loved the self-cleaning feature on the extractor," said Breitenstein. "It, cleans very well. It does need to be plugged in to use, but with an extension cord it's very attainable to clean everywhere." In terms of performance for regular usage, the robot vacuum is no slouch, with 65% sand pickup from hard flooring. On carpet, it gets 46% from low-pile carpet and 45% from mid-pile, which isn't as high as we'd have liked for something designed to clean carpets specifically, but it's still reasonably solid. In terms of other capabilities, it has all the key features you'd expect, including self-washing and drying fro the mop, brushes that can avoid getting entangled by pet hair, the ability to clean corners and self-emptying and automatic refilling for the base station. At full price, the E28 will run you $1,300, but you can often get it on sale for less, which makes it a good option if you have a lot of carpeting at home, but need to save space by not having a dedicated carpet cleaner. "For $999, I think this price is completely justified considering it comes with a carpet cleaning function," said Breitenstein, also noting that the dustbin is quite large compared with competitors.EurekaEurkea E10S: The Eureka 10S is a very capable midrange robot vacuum and mop with lidar navigation. It picked up 64.5%% of sand from hardwood, 45.2% from low-pile carpet and 40.7% from midpile. Navigation was also generally quite good, with few missed spots. At $450, there are better-performing robot vacuums from the price, like the ones from Yeedi; however, if you can get the 10S on sale for closer to $300, it's a good option in the midrange.Eureka J15 Pro Ultra: This high-end robot vacuum and mop from Eureka didn't live up to expectations. It underperformed on hardwood floors, scoring just 22% on sand pickup. It did alright on carpet, at 50% on low-pile and 49% on midpile, but for a vacuum that costs $1,000 at MSRP, this is a disappointing performance.Eureka J20: The J20 is another flagship robot vacuum and mop from Eureka that didn't wow us. It did alright in picking up sand from hardwood, scoring 66.7%, but it feels notably short on carpet, at 24.4% for low-pile and 31.9% for midpile. Despite some nice features like the self-emptying dock, mop washing, hot air drying and 3D obstacle avoidance, you get get a better robot vacuum and mop for the $1,000 price.iRobotiRobot Roomba 694: This budget-priced Roomba does a decent job cleaning carpets and hardwood floors. In terms of performance, it's extremely close to the Eufy RoboVac 25C, so if that model isn't available, give this Roomba a look as an alternative budget pick.iRobot Roomba i3 Plus: At $350 or less, this is an entry-level option among self-emptying Roombas, so if you just want something from iRobot that empties its own bin for as little cash as possible, give it a look. It was a middle-of-the-pack performer in all of our cleaning tests, never disappointing us but never really wowing us, either.iRobot Roomba i7 Plus: This is another entry-level Roomba with self-emptying smarts, and you can currently get it for roughly $600 on Amazon. In our carpet tests, it wasn't able to suck up much more than 25% of sand, which suggests some limitations to its cleaning power.iRobot Roomba J7 Plus: The Roomba J7 Plus is another Roomba vacuum that earned a place on our list for strong performance and AI-powered poop detection capabilities. However, this is a feature that's becoming increasingly common on newer models that are making impressive strides in obstacle detection and avoidance. It also lacks mopping capability, another expected feature and supplies appear to be dwindling outside of a few retailers.iRobot Roomba S9 Plus: The Roomba S9 Plus used to be our pick for pet owners and plush carpets. It excelled in our old testing procedures, picking up 71% of sand on midpile carpet. However, it lacks mopping functionality, an increasingly common feature on robot vacuums across price ranges, and its availability is dwindling.iRobot Roomba S10 Max Combo: The S10 Max Combo is iRobot's highest-end robot vacuum. It costs $1,400 at full price, though you can sometimes find it on sale for less than $1,000. As the name suggests, it can both vacuum and mop, comes with a self-emptying dock, and washes its mopping pad after every use. It had excellent hardwood performance in our testing, picking up 96.5% of sand, and better than average performance on carpet, with 67.5% on low-pile and 58.7% on midpile. Navigation was generally quite comprehensive, but it could have done tighter turns around some table legs, resulting in some missed spots. Unless you can get it on sale, there are other robot vacuums with better performance and similar features for the price.NarwalNarwal Freo X Ultra: The Freo X Ultra is a premium robot vacuum and mop combo with all the bells and whistles you'd expect. It has lidar navigation, auto mop drying and washing, a self-emptying base station and a brush that's resistant to tangling with pet hair. Performance is decent, but doesn't particularly stand out. It does well on hardwood, removing nearly 76% of sand, but falls short on carpet, removing 41.5% from low-pile and 36.3% from midpile. For $900, there are better options from Shark, Ecovacs and others.Narwal Freo Z10: The Z10 is another premium robot vacuum from Narwal priced at $1,099, but once again, performance left something to be desired. It does well on hard flooring, scoring 68.6% sand pickup from hardwood, but fared quite poorly on carpet, with just 18.6% on taller fiber carpet and 24.03% on shorter fiber carpet. Our lab tech also noted the cheap feeling replaceable insert bin inside the dustbin made of low-density plastic. People will need to periodically replace the insert bins, purchasing additional ones from Narwal, creating an added expense. We also had issues with setup, with the robot displaying an error and trying to have us replace a brand-new dustbin. Finally, it struggled to map and navigate, with the unit unable to position itself after circling our test room multiple times.NeatoNeato D9 (out of stock): Nearly identical in appearance to the D8 and the D10, the Neato D9 is a powerful vacuum, particularly on thick carpets, where it leads the way in our cleaning tests among all of the cleaners we've tested in the past two years. You won't get a self-emptying bin or a mop, but if you just want something to keep crumbs and pet hair out of your carpets, it's well worth a look as an alternative to the Roomba S9 Plus.Neato D10: One of the latest D-shaped cleaners from Neato, the D10 promises powerful suction and room-by-room navigation smarts via the Neato app. It was a relatively strong performer in our tests, but we didn't see enough of an edge over the D8 or the D9 to justify the extra expense.RoborockRoborock S5 Max (out of stock): An older model in Roborock's lineup, the S5 Max was a robot vacuum and mop combo. It did great on hardwood floors, picking up 85% of sand, but fared poorly on carpet, managing just 28% on low-pile and 41% on midpile.Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra (out of stock): It's no longer available, but when we tested it, it proved to be a fairly capable robot vacuum, scoring 76.5% on hardwood, 58.9% on low-pile carpet and 56% on midpile. The S8 MaxV Ultra is its successor and a good option if you're keen on a Roborock.Roborock S8 is a top midrange robot vacuum with excellent performance and intelligent navigation. It excels at cleaning various floor types, including those with a built-in mopping pad. While lacking a self-emptying bin, its strong performance makes it an excellent choice for homes with diverse flooring.Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is a premium robot vacuum with exceptional cleaning power and intelligent features. It effectively cleans various floor types with powerful suction and an advanced mopping system. Obstacle recognition and lidar navigation ensure efficient cleaning throughout your home.Roborock Qrevo Curv: The Qrevo Curve is a fairly expensive robot vacuum and mop, costing $1,600 at full price, though it is currently on sale for $1,300. It has an attractive design with an egg-shaped charging station. It doesn't particularly stand out in performance, but it does great on hardwood, picking up 86% on sand. It falls short with carpet at 47.7% and 42.2%, respectively.Roborock Saros 10: The Saros 10 is a very capable robot vacuum, though its $1,599 price makes it hard to recommend compared with more affordable options that offer similar performance. It did well in our testing, scoring 86%, picking up sand off hardwood floors, putting it on par with our best overall pick, the Ecovacs T30S Combo. With more plush midpile carpet, it did reasonably well at 49%, but fared lower than average with lower fiber carpet, at 35%. The dustbin was also quite small, but we were impressed by the navigation and the fact that the Saros 10 didn't require much mapping to clean. It also comes with all the premium bells and whistles, including mopping functionality, intelligent dirt detection, self-detangling main brush, hot water mopping, and dock self-cleaning. If you can get it closer to $1,000, it's a great option.Roborock Saros 10R: It's hard to keep all of Roborock's lineup straight since both the 10 and 10R have similar features and capabilities, but they have different base stations and use different types of mops and brushes. With the 10R, you get another high-end robot vacuum that offers strong performance on all the flooring we tested it on. It scored 89% removing sand from hardwood and 64% from low-pile carpet. It also did great on mid-pile with 58% removed. Naturally, it can mop and vacuum, boasts an all-in-one dock that can self-empty, has tangle-avoiding brushes, and great obstacle detection and avoidance. The sticking point ends up being the price, like the Saros 10, it'll run you $1,600 at full price, but if you can get it on sale for closer to $1,000 it offers better performance on carpet than the Saros 10 and is on par with our best overall, the T30S Combo for hard flooring.SamsungSamsung JetBot AI Plus: You already saw it fail our poop avoidance test, and that wasn't the only place where Samsung's JetBot AI Plus came up short, with pickup percentages that ranked near the bottom in all of our cleaning tests. At $650, this tech-rich robot vacuum just isn't worth it.SharkShark PowerDetect 2-in-1: The PowerDetect is Shark's high-end model, priced between $600 and $1,000. It does an excellent job of picking up rice, and it's better than average (higher than 50%) when it comes to picking up sand from low- and midpile carpets. However, its hefty weight and middling carpet performance usually mean there are better options on the market at a lower price, including the Roomba Combo J7 Plus.Shark IQ RV1001AE: A self-emptying cleaner, the Shark IQ RV1001AE is worth a look as an affordable option that empties its own bin. It gathered a respectable 84% of sand from hardwood floors in our cleaning tests but failed to pick up more than 35% of the stuff in any of our carpet tests, which isn't as strong as some of our top recommendations.YeediYeedi Cube: An offshoot of EcoVacs, the Yeedi Cube is a self-emptying floor cleaner with a built-in mopping mode. The "cube" in question is the docking bay, which looks like a little robot vacuum garage, up into which it empties its bin. It was a middle-of-the-pack performer on hardwood floors, and rather lackluster on both of our test carpets, which makes this pick pretty passable.Yeedi C12 Plus: The Yeedi C12 Plus is a solid midrange robot vacuum and mop that offers strong, across-the-board performance for a reasonable price. It was our former pick for best midpriced robot vacuum before being supplanted by the Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo. It picked up 78.65% of sand from a hardwood floor and managed 45% from low-pile and 57% from midpile carpet. Pet hair was removed easily from hardwood floors, but it took more than one pass to get it off the carpet. On the plus side, the brushes didn't tangle. Navigation was generally quite good in our light path test, with the C12 Plus keeping tight corners around a complicated table setup and generally not missing any spots. It's also no slouch on features with support for multi-level mapping and the ability to climb thresholds up to 0.8 inches, similar to the Dreame X50 Ultra and Shark NeverTouch. It comes with an all-in-one docking station that supports a self-emptying dustbin that can last for seven weeks. It lacks an auto-refill water tank, though, so you'll need to refill the 220ml water tank on the robot directly. At $479, it offers similar functionality to more expensive robot vacuums like the T30S Combo and SharkPowerDetect at less than half the price. Currently, it's on sale for $270, making it one of the best bangs for the buck robot vacuums. While the C12 Plus can do mopping, it doesn't have an auto-refill water tank in its base station, so you'll need to do that manually. The dust canister is also bagless, which we typically don't like since dust gets everywhere when you empty it. For these features, we like Yeedi's higher-end model, the M12 Pro Plus.Yeedi S14 Plus: The S14 Plus is Yeedi's newest, top-range robot vacuum and mop combo. It has a lot going for it, with strong performance on hardwood floors (82.4%) and very good performance on carpet (58% low-pile and 59.7% midpile). It's also loaded with features, an auto-empty and self-drying dock, a 3D sensor for navigation, and self-detangling brush rollers. However, at $1,400 at full price, you can get even better performance from the Yeedi M12 Pro Plus, which is our recommended robot vacuum for both vacuuming and mop and hardwood floors. It's also less than half the price.Other brands we've testedElectrolux Pure i9 (out of stock): This cleaner features a unique, triangular design, and it incorporates 3D-mapping cameras into the mix for smarter navigation. It was an underachiever in our cleaning tests, so we'd recommend shopping around.Greenworks GRV-5011: This $658 laser-guided floor cleaner performs well on hardwood floors. Couple that with the built-in mopping functionality, and it might be worthy of consideration for homes with hard floors. Performance on low- and midpile carpet was less than stellar, though, averaging toward the bottom of the pack in both cases.IonVac Smart Clean 2000: One of dozens of cheap, no-name robot vacuums available from Amazon and other online retailers, the IonVac Smart Clean 2000 was near-competent in our cleaning tests, but always just a little below average. Nothing about it stands out enough for us to recommend it.Lynkbey M20 Pro: A newcomer to our tests, Lynkbey's flagship cleaner is a self-emptying, mop-wielding powerhouse that seeks to take on Roborock. It was a top-three finisher in our hardwood floor tests, and an above-average finisher on low- and midpile carpets, although I'd note that it couldn't quite suck up 50% of the sand in either test, which is a slight red flag for performance. Still, it's a likable upgrade pick, especially if you can catch it on sale for less than the full $1,150 asking price.Lubluelu SL60D (out of stock): No longer available in the US, but still available in the EU, UK and Australia, the Lubluelu SL60D is a solid midrange or budget vacuum if you can get it for the $272 price or less. It scored well in our testing, with 77.8% sand pickup from hardwood and 55.3% from low-pile carpet. It didn't fare as well with midpile at 36.8%, but it also offers premium features including lidar navigation, mopping, voice control and a self-emptying dock.Ultenic MC1: This robot vacuum is from a little-known brand, but it was our previous pick for midrange robotics. It did well on our old lab tests, picking up nearly 75% of sand. It also boasts features like a self-emptying dock and mopping system, which is impressive for a robot vacuum. However, it's currently only available on Ultenic's storefront and lacks suction power compared to newer models.AirRobo P20: This robot vacuum and mop combo is one of the more affordable options we've tested. At $499 MSRP and frequent discounts and sales, you'll rarely get mopping and vacuuming functionality at this price. However, as a vacuum, it doesn't excel, removing just 48% of sand from hardwood floors and struggling on low-pile (22%) and midpile (18.4%) carpet.Noesis Florio F10 Pro: With a name that sounds vaguely like a dental disease, the Noesis Florio was a strange robot vacuum and mop to test. It had a very odd navigation pattern, which made it inefficient for cleaning sand and pet hair. In fact, it got the worst results of any robot vacuum we've tested, removing just 7.8% of sand from hardwood, 3.1% from low-pile carpet and 11.2% from midpile carpet. We redid the testing six times to confirm this result. The dustbin was also very small, and we were unable to properly test navigation due to the current preventing our light path test. For $1,600 at full price, this robot vacuum is not worth the money, even at a discount.Monsga MS1 Max: I was really interested in testing this robot vacuum as part of our search for a new budget or midrange pick. For $520 at full price, it offers a lot of premium features, including mopping, lidar navigation, a self-emptying bagged base station, and voice control. However, the performance was nothing to write home about. It removed 46.7% of sand off hardwood floors, but just 11.4% off low-pile carpet and 23.7% off midpile. The below-average carpet performance keeps it from earning a spot on our list. Keeping your robot vacuum clean
Robot vacuum brushes have gotten better at not getting hair tangled around itself, but sometimes you still need to help it out. Chris Wedel/CNETWe like to think that our robot vacuums are completely self-reliant and to some extent, that's increasingly true. Many robot vacuums have self-emptying docks, auto-refill water tanks and self-detangling brush rollers. However, hair can still get tangled around the brush and sensors can get dirty. Performing regular maintenance on your robot vacuum will continue to perform well for years to come. Some of the routine cleaning that needs done for your robot vacuum is daily, while other stuff can be done weekly or even monthly.Daily: Emptying the bin, checking wheels for stuck debris. Weekly: Cleaning brush rolls and wheels.Monthly: Charging contacts and cliff sensors; removing and deep cleaning the brushes.We have dedicated a complete breakdown of the different parts of your robot vacuum that will need some regular maintenance. Most of this work will take only a few minutes at most but will give you much more in return with a cleaner house. However, some of the newer robovacs reaching the market, such as those from Narwal, come with multi-function base stations that can automatically handle things like dust emptying and water tank refilling, letting it last up to 120 days before maintenance, so you can look forward to spending less time on these tasks in the future.
Robot vacuum FAQs
How long do robot vacuums last?
Robot vacuums are complex machines with more moving parts, electronics and software than ordinary vacuums. Still, with regular maintenance and replacement parts such as batteries, brushes and filters, these devices can last just as long as traditional vacuums. This should translate to multiple years of use.Keep in mind that manufacturers typically cover their robots with one-year limited warranties that include parts and labor. IRobot, Neato and Samsung are examples.
How well do robot vacuums work?
How well a robot vacuum cleans your home depends on many factors. Floors cluttered with obstacles like wires, charging cords, toys, shoes and clothing can stop robots in their tracks. The less overall clutter the better a robot will operate. Some robot vacuum models clean tile, wood flooring and different types of carpet better than others.
Can robot vacuums climb stairs?
Yes and no, depending on your definition of stairs. Dreame's new X50 Ultra, which was demoed at CES and subsequently earned a place on this list during testing. It can handle "stairs" that are 2.36 inches (4.2 centimeters+1.4cm) tall or under and sliding door tracks up to 6 centimeters wide. So if you have thresholds that are different heights in your living space, such as between the living room and kitchen or bedroom and hallway, the X50 Ultra will cross these better than a standard, legless robovac, but it won't handle a full flight of stairs.
Can a robot vacuum pick up after you?
Surprisingly, the answer is yes. The Roborock Saros Z70, the recipient of our Best of CES Award, comes with a mechanical task arm that allows it to pick up and move objects it finds lying around the room. In the demo, we saw it pick up socks and drop them at a designated location. For the moment, it's able to detect 108 obstacles, and though the arm can lift fewer items, it'll have more support in future software updates.
Can robovacs also mop?
Many robovacs now have mopping features, including many on our best list, like the Deebot T30S Combo. Many newer robovacs also incorporate this feature, like the Eureka J15 Max Ultra, which can also use AI to detect liquid spills and untangle its own brushes. There's also Narwal's Flow Series the premium Freo Z10 all-in-one robovac and Freo Pro. They're loaded with features, including mopping, multi-function base stations, hot-air drying, advanced AI object recognition and more.
What's the best robovac for pet hair?
Our current top robot vacuum for pet hair is the iRobot Roomba S9 Plus. It excelled during our pet hair pickup tests, where we scatter clumps of pet hair donated by a groomers across the floor. It also does great at tackling thick carpets. Honoroable mention goes to the Roomba J7 Plus. It has loads of smart sensors to dodge pet messes, and it works great at picking up pet hair.
What's the best robovac for hardwood floors?
The Roomba Combo J7 Plus is the best robot vacuum for hardwood floors, beating out the competition by picking up all the sand from a hardwood floor during testing. If price is no object, we also like the Dreame X40 Ultra -- it grabbed 95% of sand during testing.
What's the best robovac for carpets?
Our best overall, the Deebot T30S is also the best robot vacuum for carpets. It has tons of suction power and was able to pick up 65% of sand from carpet.
Shark vs. Roomba: Which robot vacuum is better?
Shark and iRobot (maker of the Roomba) are two top rivals in the robot vacuum market, and choosing between their products will ultimately come down to price. Shark robovacs tend to cost a bit less, but if you don't have a strict budget in mind for your robovac purchase, go with one of CNET's choices for best overall robovac, the Roomba Combo J7 Plus. For Shark, we like the full-featured Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro for its good navigation and cleaning performance, though it's on the more expensive end. For a more detailed analysis of the two brands, CNET experts have put together a comprehensive comparison.
