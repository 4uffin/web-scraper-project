Best overall coffee maker
OXO Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker
Pros
Compact
Attractive, sturdy design
Brews excellent pots of coffee quickly
Thermal carafe doesn't drip while pouring
Cons
The filter basket could be easier to fill
What we liked:The Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker coffee is approved by the Speciality Coffee Association Golden Cup, an independent program that determines if brewers meet the rigorous requirements of industry experts. The thoughtfully designed machine takes ground coffee and also comes with a special single-cup filter basket for Kalita Wave filters. The Oxo Brew is the best drip coffee maker that's compact, stylish and sturdy. Plus, it comes with a thermal carafe that doesn't drip or spill.Who it's for: This is the perfect coffee maker for anyone who wants a quality coffee machine that is sturdy and compact enough to tuck away in a cabinet when needed. It performed as well or better than models that cost $300 and kept coffee at an ideal serving temperature (160 F) for hours after brewing, thanks to the insulated stainless-steel carafe. Who should avoid it: This might not be the best choice for those who want their coffee ready by the time they wake up because there is no programmable option. It should also be noted that this coffee maker does not have a hot plate, but the coffee stays warm because of the vacuum-insulated, stainless-steel thermal carafe.  ... Show more

Best coffee maker under $100
Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Brewer
Pros
Consistent performance at a fair price
Numerous features including programmed brewing
Kept temperature stable for more than two hours
Cleaning cycle
Cons
Flimsier plastic and thinner glass than pricier picks
What we liked:Often found at a sale price of less than $70, the Ninja 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Brewer made pots of smooth, balanced coffee and bringing it home won't bust your budget. This coffee maker offers plenty of bells and whistles so you can schedule your coffee brew a day ahead, adjust the warming plate and remove the water reservoir. It did take longer to brew than others -- 10 and a half minutes -- but that's where the programmable function can come in handy. With a reusable filter in the box you can also cut down on one more coffee expense.Who it's for:If you're looking for a drip coffee maker with plenty of settings, this is the best option of the models we tested. You can make numerous adjustments, including if you want a classic or rich cup, until you find the perfect setting for your tastebuds. We found the design thoughtful and the digital controls intuitive.Who should avoid it:Someone who wants a simple machine with only one or two buttons. The plastic parts feel flimsier and the glass thinner than more expensive coffee makers on our list.  ... Show more

Best cheap coffee maker
Mr. Coffee Simple Brew 12-Cup Switch
Pros
Affordable
Simple to use, just one-button brewing
Ideal for small kitchens
Cons
There was a lot of evaporation, which resulted in less coffee
What we liked:This simple coffee maker held its own during testing and is a great starter pot for those who want a no-fuss machine. It took 12 minutes to brew a full pot and there was a decent amount of evaporation, but the coffee was smooth and the operation was easy. It also held the coffee's temperature reasonably well for more than an hour after brewing.Who it's best for: Someone who wants to make coffee at home and on a budget. Who should avoid it: Those who are looking for a coffee maker with a lot of features or one that makes speedy pots. Its build is somewhat flimsy, as you might expect from a less-than-$30 machine. Water also evaporated faster during brewing, which resulted in a smaller, more concentrated coffee than some of the better calibrated coffee makers.  ... Show more

Best for speedy pots
Breville Luxe Brewer Drip Coffee Maker
Pros
Easy to use
Brewed faster than all except one coffee maker we tested
Digital timer display
Plenty of customization options
Dedicated cold brew setting
Cons
Pricier than some other options
Larger footprint
What we liked:This coffee maker brewed quickly and efficiently in our tests. It was the second fastest, right below our top pick, the OXO 8-cup, and it has a handy timer display that we found easy to read. There are three brewing settings, including cold brew, so it's a good choice for those who want hot and cold coffee options.Who it's best for: This is a great option for those who want total control over their coffee and require a fast brew for those rushed mornings. It's available in five colors so there is a match for every kitchen. Who should avoid it: Someone on a tight budget or with limited space as it is larger than other options on our list.

Lardera Coffee
Most stylish coffee maker
Aarke Coffee Maker
Pros
Pleasing Scandi design
Easy to use
Durable metal scoop
Kept coffee at an ideal serving temperature for more than an hour
Cons
Pricier than most at $380
Rarely goes on sale
What we liked:If it's looks you're after, the Aarke stole our hearts with it's stylish Scandinavian design and shimmering stainless-steel build. This coffee pot brewed a pot of coffee in 6 minutes and held its temperature to within a degree or two over a one-hour period after brewing. The machine also stayed cool to the touch during and after the brewing process, making it a great pick for homes with curious young hands. Who it's best for: Someone who wants an easy-to-use coffee maker that brews consistently and looks great on the counter. Who should avoid it: While the Aarke delivered on brewing great pots of coffee in about 6 minutes, you're paying extra for the sleek design and a high-end finish. If this look doesn't appeal to you, it's not worth the extra money.  ... Show more

Best splurge and best for coffee connoisseur
Technivorm Moccamaster
Pros
Brews great coffee consistently
Elegant design looks like it belongs in a laboratory
Keeps coffee hot for 6 hours
Cons
Pricier than other options
Takes up a lot of space
Not programmable
What we liked:Dutch company Technivorm has sold exceptionally good drip coffee makers for decades. Its Moccamaster drip coffee machine sports a design with clean lines and sharp angles that harkens back to 1968, the year the first Moccamaster hit stores. Retro design aside, the Moccamaster KBT 741 consistently puts out perfect freshly brewed coffee that will satisfy true coffee connoisseurs. Its stainless-steel thermal carafe also keeps its contents hot for a full 6 hours.Who it's best for: Someone who takes their morning coffee seriously and doesn't mind giving up the countertop space this machine demands. Its design makes it look like laboratory equipment, giving it a conversation starter quality.Who should avoid it: Anyone who want a simple, compact drip coffee maker or budget-friendly options.  ...

Best cold brew coffee maker
Oxo Brew Cold Brew Coffee Maker
Pros
Simple to use, easy way to steep and strain grounds at room temperature
Consistently strong coffee
Paper filters add extra level of filtration
Cons
Can't brew with hot water
12-24 hours of steeping
What we liked:Cold-brew coffee is delicious but it can be a pain to make. Oxo's cold-brew coffee maker takes much of the headache out of the process -- just load it up with ground coffee and let it do its thing. This Oxo Brew coffee maker saturates coffee grounds evenly and lets you drain cold-brewed coffee from them into its glass carafe with relative ease.Who it's best for: Someone who drinks mostly cold brew coffee and is interested in making it in batches. Who should avoid it: Those who want single-servings of cold brew coffee or don't have kitchen space for a dedicated cold brew maker. For single-serving cold brew, the Breville Luxe Brewer Drip Coffee Maker have dedicated features to make strong coffee to serve over ice.

Best pour-over coffee maker
OXO Good Grips Pour-Over
Pros
Easy to manually brew coffee
Consistent
Cleaning is easy, all parts are dishwasher safe
Cons
Made of plastic instead of glass, metal or wood
What we liked: Delicious coffee and great-tasting drip from a product that costs less than $20? It sounds unlikely but that's just what the affordable OXO Good Grips Pour-Over offers. It only makes coffee one drink at a time and requires you to provide hot water and ground coffee. Looking for a great electric kettle? We've got the best electric kettle options right here. That said, the simple brewer transforms the otherwise complex task of making a pour-over into one that's easy, clean and almost foolproof.Who it's best for: Those who want a consistent pour over for an affordable price.Who should avoid it: Someone who doesn't want a plastic pour over.  ...

What to consider when buying a coffee maker
Capacity and size
A single-service machine is great for personal use. However, if you prefer a larger carriage for all-day drinking caffeine, or have a large household of coffee drinkers, a larger machine would be a better fit. While you're at it, you will also want to consider if the coffee machine fits your kitchen counter.
Customizations and features
Some machines allow for fine-tuned control over strength, temperature settings or even include a built-in grinder. These features often impact the pricing, so you will want to keep an eye out and prioritize features that you absolutely need.
Ease of use and cleaning
Programmable timers and auto-cleaning functions are great quality of life additions for long-term use and can be worth paying a premium for. At the same time, you will want to choose a coffee machine that is easy to use and clean.
Running costs
A cheap coffee machine can quickly turn expensive if maintenance costs aren't factored in. You will want to keep an eye out for machines with easy availability of spares and repairability or good warranties. Keurigs and pod coffee makers have the highest running costs because a single serving coffee pod costs between 40 cents and $1.10, significantly more than a serving made with bagged beans using a manual coffee maker. How we tested the coffee makers
Evaluating the performance of a coffee maker is trickier than it might sound. You need to know what good drip coffee is and, according to the Specialty Coffee Association, there are essential criteria for brewing well. Brewing time and water temperature top the list. Hot water should come into contact with grounds for no less than four minutes and no more than eight. The ideal water temperature range is between 197 degrees Fahrenheit (92 degrees Celsius) and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius).
Enlarge Image
We measure the temperature inside the brewing chamber of every coffee maker we test. Brian Bennett/CNETTo see how well each coffee maker met that challenge during our initial test years ago, we logged the length of their brew cycles. We also employ thermocouple heat sensors connected to industrial-grade data loggers. That enabled us to record the temperature within the coffee grounds while brewing is underway.After brewing coffee, we took sample readings of the produced coffee liquid with an optical refractometer. Given that we factor in the amount of water and freshly ground coffee used, that data lets us calculate the Total Dissolved Solids percentage of each brew. From there we arrive at the extraction percentage. The ideal range is commonly thought to be between 18% and 20%. To be certain, we brewed identical test runs a minimum of three times to get a sense of the average results.During our most recent test in 2025, we tested a total of nine coffee makers, some of which were previously tested and some that were new. We used one cup of ground coffee for each and eight cups of water. We took into account features each coffee maker had, how easy they were to use and clean and the brewing temperature of the coffee directly after brewing and up to an hour later as well to determine how well they held temperature.

Coffee maker FAQ
How long do coffee makers last?
If cared for properly a coffee maker can last for years. That said, with the exception of Technivorm Moccamasters which are covered under a five-year warranty, most coffee makers come with one-year limited warranties. Regardless of their length, all these warranties cover manufacturing defects, not ordinary wear and tear or misuse of the item.

How do coffee makers work?
Even the most sophisticated coffee makers perform the same simple task. That's to run hot water over ground coffee, then collect that liquid inside a container. Achieving the perfect balance of strength and flavors for excellent coffee is difficult. Most machines fail because either they lack quality water-heating systems, run water through the grounds too slowly, or can't brew with enough grounds to begin with. Some coffee makers suffer from a combination of these issues -- or all three.

How do you clean a coffee maker?
Besides removing external dirt, stains and dust, all coffee makers require periodic deep cleaning. Specifically, their internal water heating systems should be de-scaled regularly. Some manufacturers instruct you to do this with a vinegar-and-water solution. Others don't specify except to say to use a store-bought descaling solution. For example, Technivorn says to use products like Durgol to de-scale its machines.

Is it worth buying an expensive coffee maker?
Expensive coffee makers tend to be a good investment as they can make better coffee. These machines offer better control over temperature, and the flow of water all of which is critical to brewing a better cup of coffee.
