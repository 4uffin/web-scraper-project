Pet gadgets help make your pets' lives better. uzhursky/Getty Images
Our pets deserve the best, and CNET's pet owners are always on the watch for the best new gadgets that can help our pets when we leave for a trip, solve a health problem or just help them live happier lives. While owning a pet can be a huge responsibility, there are some pet-friendly gadgets that can help you along your journey. Here are seven of our favorites.Read more: This Smart Pet Fountain Looks So Good I Almost Drank Out of It1. Pet camera
A camera that delivers treats is an endlessly useful pet gadget. PetcubeI love my pet camera and consider it my number one must-have when caring for Walter, who has long dealt with separation anxiety. When we relocated from the Midwest to New York City, he had a hard time adjusting to a new space. Having a pet camera gave me much-needed peace of mind when we left him in the apartment because I was able to see that when we left, he was relaxing on the couch rather than barking at the door, waiting for us to return. I use the Blink Mini camera as a simple way to view him throughout the day but I recently had the opportunity to test the Petcube Cam 360 and Petcube Bites 2 Lite. These have been great additions because now that we've moved into a larger apartment, the Petcube Cam 360 covers much more space with its 360-degree rotation. Both Petcube cameras offer a crisper image and I have loved being able to toss Walter a treat with the Petcube Bites 2 Lite camera. The built-in treat dispenser allows you to toss a treat on the Petcube app remotely from your phone. For being a usually timid dog, the noise the camera makes when it's preparing to toss the treat does not seem to bother him and he's always happy to get snacks throughout the day.Best Home Pet Cams of 2025, Expert Tested

Nowhere does it say that a tracking collar can't look cool, too. TractiveThe No. 1 responsibility in caring for our pets is to, well, keep track of them. There are numerous gadgets on the market that help us do this, and experts warn against using AirTags. Instead, they suggest safer alternatives, including microchipping your pet and investing in a GPS collar such as Tractive. Tractive offers dog and cat collars that glow and track your pet's location and activity and can even send you health alerts if necessary. There are other options on the market, too and you can read our full review of the Petcube tracker here.See at Tractive3. Smart pet door
The SureFlap lets you know when your pets have exited or entered the house. Sure PetcareIf you have a yard, you may love the idea of a cat or doggy door but may also be worried about letting other animals into your home. Sure Petcare has a solution. The SureFlap Microchip Pet Door scans your pet's microchip before letting them inside your home. One thing to keep in mind is that to get this smart pet door to work, you have to purchase a separate hub to connect the door to the necessary app. Sure Petcare offers a bundle with both for $369. While we haven't tested this one yet, Amazon reviewers like that it gives their pets some freedom, while also keeping the raccoons outside.    See at Sure Petcare4. Automatic feeder
This automatic pet feeder is useful and aesthetically pleasing.  PetlibroSometimes no matter how hard you try to plan, we just don't make it home in time to feed your pet by dinnertime. This is where an automatic feeder comes in handy. The Petlibro Air Automatic Dog & Cat Bowl Feeder is a highly-rated feeder that works for cats and dogs.The battery-operated feeder features a flashing light that will turn on when the feeder is low so you never need to worry about a lapse in feeding. Whether you want to sleep in on weekends or keep your pet on a strict feeding schedule because of health concerns, an automatic feeder is a great option. See at Chewy5. Heartbeat toy
This toy can help with separation anxiety. WeokIf you have a new pet or one with separation anxiety, a Weok heartbeat puppy toy might become your new best friend. Inside the stuffed animal is a device that mimics a heartbeat, which offers comfort to your pet when you're not home or if they are in a crate. Amazon reviewers say their pets love to snuggle with and sleep next to the stuffed animal. The battery-operated heartbeat can play for up to eight hours at a time. It can also be easily removed from the stuffed animal if you need to wash the toy. See at AmazonRead more: 7 Scientific Ways Your Pet Is Helping Your Mental Health6. Electric ball launcher
Now fetch can happen all day, every day. JoyhoundThe Joyhound Electronic Ball Launcher is a great addition to your dog's toy box. It has an impressive launch range between 10 and 40 feet and comes with three tennis balls that are ideal for catching. If you have a highly energetic dog, it's a great way to help wear them out without wearing yourself out, too. See at PetSmart7. Self-cleaning litter box
Hate scooping litter? Whisker's Litter-Robot 4 lets you bypass that chore. WhiskerCleaning your cat's litter box doesn't have to be a chore now that self-cleaning litter boxes are on the market. Although they do boast a high price tag, the Whisker Litter-Robot 4 promises you'll never have to scoop again.In addition to self-cleaning, the litter box can help keep track of your cat's weight. One litter box can be used for up to four cats and is suitable for kittens. You can read our full review of Whisker Litter-Robot 4 here and decide if it's the right fit for you.See at Whisker8. Pupsicle
I'd gladly spend $20 on a toy that keeps my pup occupied for up to 20 minutes. WoofThis might be the most analog of the gadgets on our list but it might also be the one your dog loves the most. The rolling treat cage comes in three sizes and is designed to keep your dog busy as it licks away at a peanut butter treat ball placed strategically in the center. Senior editor David Watsky's 12-pound terrier loves them and the Pupsicle keeps him occupied for up to 20 minutes as he tries feverishly to get at the treat. The silicone ball easily unscrews to refill with a new treat ball made at home with special molds or bought premade by the bag.See at Chewy
