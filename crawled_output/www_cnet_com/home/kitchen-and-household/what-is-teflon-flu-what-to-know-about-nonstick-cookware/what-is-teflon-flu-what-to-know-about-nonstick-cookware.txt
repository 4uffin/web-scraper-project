How to Know If Your Teflon Pans Are Safe to Use
If you want to avoid the Teflon flu, you might want to turn down the heat on your nonstick pans.
David Watsky Senior Editor / Home and Kitchen David lives in Brooklyn where he's spent more than a decade covering all things edible, including meal kit services, food subscriptions, kitchen tools and cooking tips.
David earned his BA from Northeastern and has toiled in nearly every aspect of the food business, including as a line cook in Rhode Island where he once made a steak sandwich for Lamar Odom.
Right now he's likely somewhere stress-testing a blender or tinkering with a toaster. Anything with sesame is his all-time favorite food this week. Expertise Kitchen tools | Appliances | Food science | Subscriptions | Meal kits

If you're not careful with your nonstick pots and pans, they can do more harm than good. Maryna Terletska/Getty Images
If you're thinking of kitchen essentials, a nonstick pan is right up there. It can be excellent for cooking, especially if you hate cleanup, and is versatile enough to handle everything from simply frying an egg to cooking the perfect steak. However, nonstick cookware is often coated in Teflon. Although you can find a wide variety of nonstick cookware sets on the market, Teflon is a popular option. It's been around since the 1930s, and it's seen some questions from consumers surrounding the safety of the chemical-coated pans, especially in recent years.
CNETLast year, the US saw an increase in reported cases of "Teflon flu." If that's something that has been on your mind, you're not alone. You can find a ton of Reddit users with the same concerns, with many wondering if it's dangerous to inhale Teflon fumes while cooking. The good news? If you have cookware that was made after a certain year and you use it properly, you shouldn't have issues with Teflon flu. But there are a few more things you should know and consider. Here's all you need to know about Teflon flu and how you can use your nonstick kitchenware without health worries.Read more: Never Raise Your Air Fryer Above This TemperatureWhat is Teflon flu?
Air fryer baskets are often made with a synthetic nonstick coating. David Watsky/CNETThe chemical polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), found in Teflon and similar nonstick surfaces, is common in air fryers, pots and pans and other kitchen appliances. When these materials overheat, they can release synthetic compounds that pose health risks.Polymer fume fever, or Teflon flu, has reignited a debate about nonstick cookware safety. The illness occurs when fumes from an overheated Teflon or nonstick pan are inhaled. Nonstick pans are made with polytetrafluoroethylene (also known as PTFE). PTFEs are known as "forever chemicals" because they take decades or sometimes even hundreds of years to break down. Read more: I Upgraded to This PFAS-Free Glass Fryer and You Should, TooSymptoms of Teflon fluUnder normal use, PTFEs aren't thought to cause a health risk, but when heated to above 500 degrees Fahrenheit, there are increased emissions and the resulting polymer fume fever.Polymer fume fever causes a range of reported symptoms including fever, chills, muscle tension and headache. Symptoms of Teflon flu are temporary and generally start within 12 hours of exposure but can take up to 24 hours to take hold.Best Nonstick Frying Pans, Tested and Reviewed

How to avoid Teflon fluTeflon and nonstick cookware are easy to use, clean and maintain, but it should be used only for low to medium heat cooking. Never heat your nonstick cookware over high heat or medium heat for long periods of time. Try to keep the surface temperature at or below 450 degrees Fahrenheit, or emissions from the PTFE coating are likely to increase.  Best Stainless-Steel Skillets

What is Teflon and does it cause cancer?Nonstick or Teflon is a popular choice for home cooks. The biggest advantage is that food won't stick to pots and pans coated with Teflon the way it does to other metal materials, so it's easy to flip a pancake or remove a cooked egg. Nonstick is also very easy to clean, generally taking no more than a few seconds to wash by hand. Teflon is a brand name for a synthetic chemical called polytetrafluoroethylene that's used in many household products, from wire coatings to fabric protectors and kitchen cookware. The knock on Teflon is that it's unsafe if consumed or absorbed into the body and can increase the chances of cancer and other diseases. Studies have shown some connections (more on that below), but Teflon still exists and is used to make cookware, and the safety concerns around Teflon are mostly a thing of the past. I stress mostly. Here's why…The brand Teflon may be associated with a risk of cancer, but it's actually a chemical formerly used in the making of Teflon called PFOA that's to blame. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, perfluorooctanoic acid is a manufactured perfluorochemical developed in the 1930s and used to make fluoropolymer coatings and products that resist heat, oil, stains, grease and water.
Thanks to a federal ban, all Teflon and nonstick cookware made after 2013 should be free of harmful PFOA. Europe enacted the same ban in 2008. All-CladWhat are the negative effects of PFOA?In some studies, PFOA has been linked to cancer, immune deficiency and a host of other medical problems. It has also been shown to affect growth and development and injure the liver in laboratory animals.As recently as 2017, chemical giant Dupont settled a lawsuit for more than $670 million for its role in contaminating drinking water with PFOA (also referred to as C-8) in the mid-Ohio Valley. A previous class-action suit from 2004 in the same area led to a study that found PFOA was linked to cancer and compromised immune function, even in small doses. Teflon cookware made before 2013 may be toxicAll that was enough for most manufacturers to halt the production of nonstick coatings using PFOA around 2002. Teflon using PFOA wasn't officially banned in the United States until 2014. Europe banned it in 2008. That means if you own Teflon nonstick cookware from 2013 or earlier, there's a chance it contains PFOA. Nine years is typically longer than the average lifespan of a nonstick pan, but if you're not sure, it's probably best to replace any Teflon-coated pots or pans. If you're concerned, look for PFOA-free cookwareBecause of the ban, all nonstick cookware made in the US should be PFOA-free, but you'd be wise to make sure. Be extra cautious about buying cheap or off-brand cookware, especially if it's not produced in a country with an active PFOA ban. PFOA is still produced elsewhere, largely in China, and used to make consumer products. The good news is that PFOA-free nonstick cookware is cheap, so there's no reason to risk it with anything that might contain the chemical. You can nab a 10-inch skillet from a trusted cookware brand like Misen for $99 or Tramontina for about $30. Luxury cookware brand All-Clad makes a two-piece nonstick cookware set for $80.
The Always Pan is a nonstick ceramic alternative to Teflon cookware. Our PlaceThe best natural nonstick cookware alternativesIf you're ready to ditch Teflon and chemical-based nonstick pots and pans, there are plenty of more natural nonstick alternatives. The most nonstick of the bunch is ceramic cookware, which has seen a boom in popularity since concerns about Teflon first surfaced. A few popular ceramic cookware options include The Always Pan (read my full review here), Caraway and Greenpan.Cast iron is another cookware material that develops a natural nonstick coating over time, especially if you season it well and care for it properly. It won't likely ever become as nonstick as Teflon, but cast iron has loads of other culinary benefits that are worthy of a few extra seconds of scrubbing in the sink after use. Lodge is a tried-and-true cast-iron cookware producer: You can scoop up a 10-inch skillet for as little as $25.
Cast iron develops a nonstick patina over time and is a natural alternative to Teflon.  Angela Lang/CNETCarbon steel is yet another option and functions similarly to cast-iron cookware, although it's not quite as heavy, slightly more sensitive to corrosion, and typically more expensive. Carbon steel hasn't really popped off here in the US but is a favorite of professional chefs, as well as yours truly. Cookware startup Made In produces some excellent carbon steel cookware with prices starting around $99, but there are cheaper options out there.FAQs
Should I worry about buying Teflon nonstick cookware?
The Teflon brand stopped using PFOA, the offending chemical behind Teflon flu, in 2013. That means that it should be safe to use new Teflon cookware any way you see fit -- although it couldn't hurt to continue being cautious when using new nonstick cookware.
Can I only catch Teflon flu from Teflon products?
No. The name Teflon flu originates from the Teflon brand because they famously used PFOA chemicals in the process of creating its cookware before 2013. However, that doesn't mean your cookware is PFOA-free. If your cookware is created in the US, it should be free of harmful chemicals. But cheap companies and off-brands that create cookware in countries without PFOA bans often still use the chemical in their products, and those might still wind up in your hands.
How common is Teflon flu?
Teflon flu is not incredibly common but there are still a significant number of cases reported each year. In 2023, there were 267 reported cases in the United States, the most since 2000, according to America's Poison Control centers. The National Capital Poison Center also states that incidents of Teflon flu are likely underreported, as symptoms often appear hours after exposure and can mimic the common cold.
Are Teflon and nonstick pans only toxic if you scratch them?
Teflon and nonstick pans are not only toxic if you scratch them. The main issue with them is the toxic fumes they can release on heating. Although scratching will release some microplastic materials into food, typically, it's a minimal amount compared to the toxins released by heating. Although if you notice your pan scratching easily or is already very scratched up, you should consider replacing it.
