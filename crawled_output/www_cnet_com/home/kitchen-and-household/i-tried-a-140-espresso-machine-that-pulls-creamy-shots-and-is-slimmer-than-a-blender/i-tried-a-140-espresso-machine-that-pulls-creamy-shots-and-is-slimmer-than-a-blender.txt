Final verdict on the Casabrews CM5418
In testing espresso machines to find the best in class, we found that a really good model will cost north of $400. We found a serviceable budget pick at a fraction of that cost, but it still requires a good deal of kitchen real estate. As an apartment dweller with limited counter space, I was eager to try the Casabrews CM5418, a diminutive espresso machine crafted by coffee enthusiasts and available for under $150. If the economy has you down and you're hoping to blunt your coffee shop spending by making espresso drinks at home, here's everything you need to know about the $140 Casabrews before buying.
The $140 Casabrews is slimmer than most blenders. Pamela Vachon/CNETCasabrews CM5418 at a glanceStyle: Semiautomatic espresso machine with 1-cup, 2-cup and steam wand capabilitiesDimensions: ‎5.47 by 12.28 by 11.97 inches (width, depth, height)Watts: 1,350Weight: 10.4 poundsPrice: $140About CasabrewsCasabrews launched in 2020 in response to the pandemic, with the company noting that more people were making coffee at home and wanted the small, daily luxury that quality espresso afforded, without the daily trip out of the house. Founded by a team of young coffee enthusiasts, and with the tagline "my casa, my coffee," Casabrews was intended to offer the American market espresso machines that are not only affordable but also well designed and high quality.The CM5418 is a midline model among the machines Casabrews offers, but its primary source of interest to me was its relatively small space requirement. At only about 5.5 inches wide, it works in the smallest of small kitchens -- that's about all the counter space I have left, after the necessary toaster oven. (By comparison, the Breville Oracle Jet I tested took up all my available counter space, even after the toaster oven was ejected to make way.) Also of note: Unlike most other espresso machine manufacturers, Casabrews is only in the espresso machine business.Best Coffee Subscriptions for 2025

Casabrews CM5418 operationThis Casabrews model went from unboxing to brewing in minimal time. There aren't any tricks to getting the machine up and running. The detachable water tank is unfussy to load and unload in order to refill, and the one-shot and two-shot cups are simple to interchange in the portafilter. The buttons are intuitive: Blinking blue lights indicate the machine is readying itself, and when the lights are steady, it's good to go. The heavy duty portafilter also locks in place snugly and effortlessly.
The CM5418 offers simple buttons on the front of the machine. Pamela Vachon/CNETThe built-in pressure gauge isn't adjustable, but it offers confidence in the 20 bars of pressure the brand promises. What's more, the proof is in the pudding: The shots pull slowly and consistently, producing a bold brew with a thick crema in about 25 seconds, even with conventional coffee grounds.I have no barista training, so I'm an ideal candidate for testing the foam wand of an at-home espresso machine. This one created a powerful whirlpool, whipping and heating the milk into a thick, creamy and pourable foam that in no way resembled dish suds. (If you think this is a given, then you haven't much experimented with espresso machines.) The only thing the machine can't do for you is latte art, but given the quality of the coffee and foam, you may be motivated to practice.
The machine created a thick and creamy topping.  Pamela Vachon/CNETWhat I liked about the Casabrews CM5418There's a lot to like about the Casabrews CM5418, beginning with its size and price but by no means ending there. Its intuitiveness and its quality output are more than enough to justify its price tag, but a few other features may be of interest if you're considering buying one.My favorite feature of this machine -- other than the fact that it made great coffee -- was the portafilter. This might be otherwise overlooked, but it matters in terms of your willingness to use the machine on a daily basis. The portafilter included here is not only heavyweight but it also has a particular design and balance, allowing it to sit level on the countertop for easy filling and tamping. This is the detail that sold me on a machine that was thoughtfully made by coffee people for potentially non–coffee people (or burgeoning coffee people).
The portafilter is weighted and balanced for easy filling. Pamela Vachon/CNETThe CM5418 also comes in a variety of colors, for people uninterested in adding another black or stainless steel appliance into their morning routine. Though the price goes up a bit, for $170 you can add a splash of color to the proceedings: two different shades of blue, plus a creamy beige and a cheerful pink.Finally, a 30-day money back guarantee is available if you buy directly from Casabrews, where promotional discounts are also frequently available. A current 15% off promotion means the stainless steel model runs you only $120. That's about a month's worth of out-of-the-house espresso drinks.Read more: Skip the Trip to a Coffee Shop and Make Homemade Iced or Hot LattesWhat I didn't like about the Casabrews CM5418The only odd element with the Casabrews CM5418 is toggling between making coffee and making steam, which is pushed through the steam wand to create a frothy milk. In fairness, this is addressed in the manual and the quick-start guide, on the website, and even on a "useful tips" sticker included on the machine. Expelling hot water through the steam wand is important for both ensuring hot espresso and switching back to making espresso after making steam. (It can also be used as a moment to preheat your coffee mug, so it's not entirely a wasted step.)It's not challenging to do the toggling, but if you're reluctant to read instructions, you may find yourself sitting in front of a panel of flashing lights wondering why you can't make a second cappuccino.While the portafilter is tremendous, the tamper included with this model isn't: It's a cheap, plastic model that acts as both scoop and tamper. It doubtless keeps the price down, but you'll want to upgrade it. With many heavier duty espresso tampers available at various online retailers for less than $15, the CM5418 is still a bargain.
Casabrew pulls creamy espresso shots. Pamela Vachon/CNETFinal verdict on the Casabrews CM5418Though a small kitchen doesn't necessarily mean a small budget, for folks who crave the luxury of espresso but think they don't have the means or the space, the Casabrews CM5418 can really challenge those assumptions. Slimmer than an average toaster, cheaper than a month of Starbucks and capable of allowing nonbaristas to make barista-quality drinks, the Casabrews CM5418 might be the ideal model for folks on the fence.
