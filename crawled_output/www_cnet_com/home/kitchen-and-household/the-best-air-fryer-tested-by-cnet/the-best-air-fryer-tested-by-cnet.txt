If you’re aiming to eat healthier without giving up on flavor or convenience, an air fryer is the perfect companion. They use less oil to achieve the same crispy and caramelized texture you get from pan-frying, roasting, and broiling. To help you find the best, I've tested models from Ninja, De’Longhi, Breville, Phillips, Cosori and Dash.

What health experts say about air fryers
Buying guide: What to consider when choosing an air fryer
From cooking whole chickens to crisping up chickpeas, vegetables or salmon, air fryers handle it all with ease. I make no secret of my love for air fryers, and I've been testing various models for more than five years. My list of favorite things to make in the air fryer grows by the week, but choosing the right countertop oven to make them isn't as simple as it seems. What's the best air fryer overall?
NinjaWhen Ninja released its Ninja glass-bowl Crispi, we got a new favorite air fryer on our list after two years. The Crispi has loads of power and is easy to clean, plus the cooking chamber doubles as a portable food container. This is hands down the best air fryer to buy in 2025. And guess what? It's available for just $180 -- a bargain.The dynamic glass Crispi is the air fryer we now recommend most, but there are several other picks to choose from that cost less, hold more food or feature additional cooking modes and methods not available on that model.
With the Ninja Crispi, food is ready to be packed away or brought to a party as soon as it's done without dirtying another dish.  Pamela Vachon/CNETRead more: The Air Fryer Is the Best and Fastest Way to Make a Roast Chicken Best air fryers of 2025

Best air fryer overall
Ninja Crispi glass air fryer
Pros
Glass cooking chamber is easy to clean
Can view your food's progress without stopping
Cooking chamber turns into a sealed food container
Simple controls
Cons
Glass gets hot during and after cooking
Pricier than others on the list
No precise control of temperature
What I liked:Our new favorite air fryer comes from the makers of our old favorite. The glass bowl Ninja offers several advantages over metal and nonstick cooking baskets. First, you can see your food while it's being cooked. After cooking, the glass bottom chamber converts to a sealable food carrier when you pop on a rubber lid. As a bonus, the Ninja Crispi's glass cooking chamber was the easiest to get squeaky clean of all the air fryers we've tested. Unlike most air fryers that utilize a basket that slides in and out of the machine, this air fryer has a cooking mechanism that clamps down on one of the included 4-quart or 6-cup containers. The powerful coils cooked everything we put inside to a perfect, even crisp. Four simple cooking modes -- warm, reheat, bake, and air fry -- and the adjustable timer made using the machine a breeze.Who is it for:It's the best air fryer for those who are particular about getting their kitchen tools squeaky clean. It's also the best air fryer for anyone concerned about nonstick coatings and the potential hazards they present.Who should avoid it:The one downside, aside from the high price, is that the glass chamber gets and stays pretty hot both during and after cooking, which could present a danger to careless cooks or those with small children. The glass bowls are equipped with stay-cool handles for handling and transporting the air fryer.

Best air-frying toaster oven
Our Place Wonder Oven
Pros
Modest size is good for crowded kitchens
Air fryer function was great
Able to do gentle toasting in addition to powerful air-frying
Fun retro look and available in a range of colors
Steam function helps keep food moist
Cons
There are definitely cheaper options available
Air fryer toaster ovens aren't as easy to clean
What I liked:A conveniently sized, PFAS-free, countertop-worthy appliance that can air fry, bake, roast, toast, reheat and broil -- all with steam infusion technology for crispy exteriors and soft, moist interiors. It does everything, from ultra-crispy air frying to serious roasting, to rejuvenating steam infusion. It’s fairly spacious, although certainly not the largest oven we tried. You could roast a roughly 4-pound chicken or go multilevel to cook double the capacity of a stand-alone air fryer. This oven allows you to Who is it for:If you have trouble keeping your air-fryer food from drying out, the Wonder Oven is the only model on our list with a steam function that helps keep food moist while it's being blasted with superconvection heat.Who should avoid it:The modest capacity means you may have to cook food in batches. If you regularly feed a large crowd, consider upgrading to a larger air fryer or air-frying toaster oven.  ... Show more

Best air fryer under $100
Ninja 4-quart air fryer
Pros
Has major power and cooked food faster than any other air fryer we tested
The build is sturdy
Controls are simple
At $69, it's an excellent value
Cons
Its shiny plastic body shows fingerprints easily
What I liked:Ninja's sleek and efficient pod air fryer impressed us in several rounds of testing. At $69, it's a clear pick for the best budget air fryer in 2025. The Ninja is powerful, easy to operate, looks great and is reasonably priced. We tested both the 4-quart model and the otherwise identical 5.5-quart model (perfect for roasting a whole chicken). There were no discernible differences in performance between the two. The Ninja turned out the best chicken wings of any air fryer we cooked them in. It seems to run a little hotter than other models of its size, but I consider that a good thing. Air frying is about getting the outside crispy without drying out the middle, and you need a blast of hot convection to do it. Who is it for:Those seeking a budget-friendly basket-style air fryer with lots of power. The Ninja's control panel is simple and intuitive. Beyond flicking on the air fryer, there are a handful of presets and cooking modes, including bake and reheat, that are perfect for warming bread or reviving leftover pizza without burning it. Who should avoid it:This air fryer sports a nonstick basket, so if you're worried about chemical leaching or the coating wearing out over time, choose Ninja's glass-bowl air fryer instead. One other thing to note is that the Ninja lacks a special cooking mode for vegetables. Much as in earlier rounds of testing, the fresh Brussels sprouts emerged a tad overdone -- even burnt in spots. This simply requires a little more checking when you're air-frying certain foods for the first time.  ... Show more

Instant Pot
Photo Gallery 1/4
Instant Pot
Best air fryer and multicooker
Instant Pot Duo Crisp
Pros
Air fryer and pressure cooker both work great
Great value considering how much it does
Cons
Difficult to clean after air frying
Heavier than solo air fryers
What I like:This Instant Pot model is a pressure cooker, slow cooker, and air fryer with sear and steam functions, to boot. I found the air fryer function worked as well or better than most of the solo air fryers I tested. Instant Pot's Duo model made incredible crispy "fried" chicken, wings, veggies, and other classics, but know that you'll likely have to cook in batches if you're making food for a group. It's also a solid deal considering all this machine does. The Duo Crisp can often be found for $150 or cheaper if you nab it on sale.Who is it for:If you're eyeing an air fryer but also an Instant Pot or another multicooker, let me save you some money and kitchen space. The Instant Pot Duo does all the work of the popular multicooker -- pressure cooker, slow cooker, steam and saute -- but comes with a separate air fryer lid and cooking function as well.Who should avoid it:It's worth noting that the air fryer cooking capacity is relatively small, even if the full chamber for pressure and slow cooking is large. Another thing I didn't love about this model is the steel air fryer basket, which is trickier to clean than the pod-shaped models, most of which feature nonstick cooking baskets.  ... Show more

Breville

Breville
Best splurge air fryer
Breville Smart Oven Air
Pros
Sleek design and consistent function
Close to a replacement for your wall oven
Preheats fast
Great for holidays or when extra cooking capacity is needed
Cons
Expensive
A large cooking chamber makes it harder to get that true air fryer crust.
The air fryer function isn't as powerful as some others we tried
What I like:Breville's stylish Smart Oven Air is our favorite air fryer and toaster combo. This isn't just a proficient air fryer but a mini version of a smart oven that can handle a small chicken, as many as four filets of salmon or a tray of homemade cookies. Most likely because of its size, the Smart Oven Air took a little bit longer to get crispy chicken wings and Brussels sprouts, but only by a few minutes. Who is it for:If you want a countertop appliance that can do far more than wings and wedges, this is a whole lot of oven capability. The Breville heats very consistently and has a wealth of cooking modes -- toast, bagel, bake, roast, broil, warm, reheat, air fry -- making it about as good a replacement for your big oven as any. This makes a great supplement to your large oven during holidays and other occasions where extra cooking capacity is welcomed. Who should avoid it:If you like a toaster oven and are just looking for an air fryer, this probably isn't the pick.  ... Show more

Best small air fryer for beginners
Dash 2-quart air fryer
Pros
Light and easy to move around the kitchen
Good power despite a compact 2-quart size
Comes in 5 colors
Has a fun retro look
Cons
Small 2-quart capacity is not ideal for large groups or families
What I like:As the award suggests, this air fryer is small. About as small as any brand makes them. If you're only cooking for one or two people, it may be enough capacity and will save you precious space on the counter. The Dash has enough power to make eight or nine crispy chicken wings in about 20 minutes and a few servings of fries in about half that time. The single analog dial is easy to manipulate, and there is just one mode -- air fry -- to keep things uncomplicated. For an air fryer under $50, this model is fairly solid, and the basket fits snugly into the hull without any wobble. It's also easy to clean and quiet when running.  Who is it for:If you're after pure value, the Dash performs well and will cost less than $50. It's also perfect for smaller kitchens or those wanting to test out an air fryer without committing much money or kitchen space. Who should avoid it:If you're cooking for more than two or three people, this air fryer won't be big enough.

Best air fryer for large families
Ninja Foodi DualZone air fryer
Pros
Dual basket design allows you to cook multiple foods at once
Huge capacity for making big batches of food for crowds
Cons
Takes up a lot of space in the kitchen
Expensive for an air fryer
What I like:A dual-basket air fryer allows you to cook most of an entire meal in one go without fear of burning one thing or undercooking the other. Smaller baskets net better results when air frying, so I suggest a dual-basket as opposed to an oven with one single, large cooking chamber. This model has all the same settings and cooking modes as Ninja's single-basket model, but allows you to toggle between both baskets to set the time and temp accordingly. There's also a handy match-cook setting if you're doing one huge heap of wings in both baskets. While Instant also makes a formidable version, Ninja's 8-quart (two 4-quart baskets) is our top pick. It sports tons of power at a great price. As with the single-basket Ninja, this machine feels rock solid, and the baskets slide in firmly with no wiggle. Who is it for:This is the perfect air fryer for those who regularly cook for big groups. You can make double batches of wings or cook two recipes at once for a full meal without having to do it in batches or worry about overcooking one of the recipes.Who should avoid it:This is a massive air fryer and will dominate whatever part of the countertop you keep it on. If you don't regularly cook for large groups, opt for one of the smaller, less expensive models on our list. This dual-basket model also has a smaller 6-quart model (two 3-quart baskets) and a massive 10-quart version (two 5-quart baskets) available.Want more info?

The Instant Pot Duo Crisp air fryer and multicooker turned out some excellent air-fried chicken. David Watsky/CNET Other air fryers we tested
Dreo Chefmaker: This souped-up air fryer has a built-in thermometer and tons of smart features. It works ggreen t but I found myself just using the basic air fryer function which makes it hard to justify the $359 price.Dash Tasti-Crisp: I don't have major complaints with this model's function, but it feels a little flimsy for $60.Crux Marshmello: This compact 3-quart air fryer did well in testing and the cooking basket was easy to clean. I wasn't a fan of the control panels, which sport cutesy LED images in place of words, and it wasn't abundantly clear what each one was for.  Phillips air fryer: I had no issues with this air fryer and liked the sleek design and intuitive controls. It performed similarly to the Ninja 4-quart but that model, our top budget pick, costs $100 less.
The Crux air fryer performed well but the control panel was a little too cute for its own good.  David Watsky/CNETPowerXL Air Fryer: This is another small air fryer that did well in testing, but I prefer the controls and sleek design of the more budget-friendly Gourmia 2-quart.
InstantInstant Vortex: One popular option is the Instant Vortex. It's priced in line with the other air fryers in this group. The Vortex is made by the same company that created the groundbreaking Instant Pot electric pressure cooker. Despite that, I wasn't blown away by its results. Chicken wings and fried chicken were acceptable but not incredible and less juicy than what other fryers produced. My Brussels sprouts ended up overdone too, and frozen fries cooked unevenly. Dash Compact Air Fryer: We found the Dash Compact Air Fryer to be underpowered. While the larger Dash Deluxe is a powerhouse, the Dash Compact struggled to air-fry almost everything we put inside it. Both french fries and Brussels sprouts were under-done and unevenly cooked. The only bright spot was chicken wings. They took 30 minutes, but I was treated to skin with some crunch.  GoWise USA 8-in-1 Digital Air Fryer: You may not have heard of this brand, but this offering from GoWise is a solid choice. It didn't cook the skin of my chicken wings evenly. That said, french fries came out crispy and crunchy, with fluffy interiors. The fryer also roasted Brussels sprouts well, no mean feat for this group of appliances.

Brian Bennett/CNETChefman 3.5 qt. Analog Air Fryer: Another relatively affordable choice is the Chefman Analog Air Fryer. It's tiny, too, offering just 3.5 quarts of food-frying capacity. The appliance delivered decent chicken wings, but it undercooked the Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries. We also found the Chefman's timer control confusing. This dial is labeled in numerical increments of 10. The numbers are separated by groups of four dots, not nine, as you would expect. PowerXL Vortex Air Fryer: You might consider purchasing the PowerXL Vortex, but we recommend against it due to its steep price and mediocre frying performance. We had satisfactory results cooking chicken wings in it, but this machine overcooked Brussels sprouts, and the french fries were just OK. DeLonghi Rapid Crisp: The DeLonghi Rapid Crisp was one of the most expensive models we tested, and it just didn't live up to the price tag. While I liked the design and sturdy build and appreciated the small viewing window for watching the cooking progress, I found the buttons and interface clunky. There was no way to set an actual cooking temp, only presets, and even those weren't very intuitive.
David Watsky/CNETBeautiful Air Fryer by Drew Barrymore: This air fryer offering from the actor's new kitchen line performed well in the four rounds of testing. It showed good power and cooked chicken wings to a nice crispy outside and kept them juicy inside after about 25 minutes. The air fryer's interface is slick, although I liked the Ninja's simpler control panel more, which is one of a few reasons it edged out this unit for best air fryer overall. This is a great option and is about $30 cheaper than the Ninja. It also has a pleasing design with smooth matte plastic (which does smudge a bit).
How we test air fryers
The Cosori Lite made some mighty tasty wings in 30 minutes.  David Watsky/CNETTo date, we've tested well over a dozen air fryers to curate this list. Each air fryer is evaluated for its power, consistency, ease of use, design, features and overall performance. In total, we've logged results for more than 20 air fryers and over 75 hours of air fryer testing.There are hundreds of recipes that can be made with an air fryer but we stuck to the basics and focused on the most popular foods people associate with air fryers. Chicken wings are at the top of that list, but french fries, frozen snacks and dense vegetables -- in this case, Brussels sprouts -- are air fryer food staples. Before we began, we consulted each model's manual for relevant cooking directions. If the manual didn't provide specific instructions, we applied uniform procedures to each air fryer depending on the type of food we were preparing.
You can make a whole roasted chicken in your air fryer.
David Watsky/CNETFor chicken wings, we followed a basic air fryer recipe. First, we preheated the air fryer to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 25 minutes in the basket with the included tray, then checked on them and turned them every 8 minutes. Most of the air fryers we tested had a solid showing in the wing test, although some, including the powerful Ninja and Cosori Lite models, got the wings a bit crispier in that amount of time. For Brussels sprouts, we preheated the ovens to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and cooked them for 15 minutes. Before cooking, we rinsed and cut the sprouts in half and tossed them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. In this test, some ovens struggled to brown the outside of the sprouts, but most got there eventually.
Dense Brussels sprouts are a popular air fryer food. Soft and watery veggies such as zucchini and mushrooms may turn to mush under this type of intense heat. David Watsky/CNETFor the french fry test, we opted for Alexia's frozen crinkle-cut fries and cooked 1 cup, according to the air fryer directions on the bag. Quick note: Be careful when cooking fries in an air fryer as some types, especially thinner-cut fries, can dry out easily when hit with super-convection. We recommend heftier waffle fries, tater tots, crinkle cut or potato wedges over the shoestring variety.
The Duo Crisp with Ultimate Lid turned out equally browned sweet potato fries as as olo air fryer in the same amount of time. David Watsky/CNETAt the end of each test, we looked for how evenly the items were cooked, if they were cooked through and whether they had a sufficient level of crispy, crunchy, fried goodness comparable to deep frying or pan frying. Ease of use
I liked the top placement of the control panel on the Cosori Lite air fryer.  David Watsky/CNETBeyond cooking performance, how easy an air fryer is to operate and how intuitive the buttons and controls were something we observed closely during testing. Overly complicated settings, controls and presets didn't generally result in high marks, but certain features were appreciated. All air fryers have base-level control over the temperature and cook time, although some are controlled digitally while others require the crank of simple manual dials. From there, you'll find preset programs for various foods such as wings, fries, fish, veggies and even baked goods.
You can see your food while it's being cooked in the Ninja Crispi air fryer.  David Watsky/CNETHow well they cook To get a sense of how each air fryer in this test group handles, we ran a battery of three tests on each model. Each test focused on one food: chicken wings, Brussels sprouts and frozen french fries.
Most air fryers we tested passed the French fries test, although it's critical to check on them frequently so you don't overcook and dry them out.  David Watsky/CNET What health experts say about air fryers
How healthy cooking with an air fryer is depends on what you put in it.
David Watsky/CNETThe Cleveland Clinic: "They [air fryers] won't magically remove the saturated fat from bacon or the trans fats from a bag of processed chicken wings. To reap the benefits, reach for better-for-you options like vegetables and lean proteins....Think of the air fryer as a way to enhance healthier foods, so they're even more tempting."Medical News Today: "Research on the effects of air-fried food is promising. Air fryers appear to be a healthy alternative, offering flavors similar to fried food with fewer adverse effects."British Heart Foundation: "If you often eat deep-fried foods, switching to an air fryer could be helpful." Buying guide: What to consider when choosing an air fryer
An air fryer can bring efficiency and simplicity to your nightly meal routine. It's easy to make a quick and delicious meal with the best air fryers in your kitchen. They are not only healthier than an oven but also use less energy. Check out the complete guide to air fryers to learn more about these great kitchen appliances. Pod-shaped air fryers vs. air-frying toasters
Air frying toaster ovens have advantages but they typically take longer to cook and the inner cavity can be tricky to clean if food splatters.  David Watsky/CNETWhile the idea of a toaster oven that doubles as an air fryer is a good one, and the air frying function on many of the hybrid machines is proficient, certain foods we love cooking in an air fryer are too messy to cook in a toaster. All pod air fryers have removable cooking baskets and most of them are nonstick. When you're cooking chicken thighs with a sauce or even veggies drizzled with oil -- a few favorites -- there is going to be some inevitable splatter. Air frying mode is intense, with high convection heat circulated at a fast pace. Do this in a toaster oven, which is markedly more difficult to clean, and you'll be dealing with some serious caked-on gunk after the first few dozen uses.
You won't need more than 15 minutes to make this magic happen in an air fryer. air fryer chicken thighsPod air fryers, on the other hand, take very little effort to get clean. Most air fryer baskets are now thicker and also nonstick. Beware of thin wire baskets, which can be tougher to clean. Both types can be removed to soak in the sink and some can be run through the dishwasher. The same can't be said for the inside walls of a countertop oven. If you're buying a toaster oven, there's no reason not to get one with an air fryer function. It can still be used for less splatter-prone foods such as potatoes, frozen empanadas and filets of salmon with too much risk of making a mess. For more, read CNET's complete guide to air fryers.Air fryer size
Here's the tiny 2-quart Gourmia air fryer next to the more standard 4.25-quart Phillips model. David Watsky/CNETWhile there are several features to consider, the size of your air fryer is likely the most important decision you'll make. If you're typically cooking for one or two people, a 2- or 3-quart air fryer should be large enough. Consider adding another quart of capacity to your air fryer for every person that you're regularly cooking for. A family of four or five, for instance, should be fine with a 5-quart model. If you plan on regularly cooking full meals for a family, including meat and veggies or sides, you might consider a larger, dual-basket air fryer like the Ninja DualZone.
All that said, the smaller the air fryer you can get away with the better. I've found that smaller air fryers such as the Magic Bullet 2- to 5-quart model and Instant Pot's Duo Crisp net better results since food will get blasted faster and more often than inside a larger model. Smaller air fryers mean less overall capacity, so you may have to cook in batches.
Power
We made sure every air fryer on our list has the power to blast cauliflower, chicken wings and potatoes to a crispy finish. Corin Cesaric/CNETMost air fryers are somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 watts. Larger air fryers typically have more wattage and smaller models have less. Your midrange 4-quart air fryer should have about 1,500 watts. The small Magic Bullet and Gourmia air fryers have 1,300, but that's plenty of power to cook food in the petite basket. Larger air fryers should have about 100 more watts per quart to make sure they hit those hot temps of 400 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
Air fryer accessoriesSome fancy models may come with extra accessories, but all you need is an air fryer basket with wire or nonstick grates. They come standard with most air fryer models and help the super-convection to hit all sides of your food evenly. I prefer the nonstick variety as wire baskets can be particularly tricky to clean.
All the air fryers we tested came with a grated fryer basket or tray. The Philips Essential Digital model has it attached to the handle making it easier to remove for cleaning.  David Watsky/CNET Should you just get a normal air fryer or a multifunction model?
The Duo Crisp with Ultimate Lid turned out equally browned sweet potato fries as a single-function solo air fryer in the same amount of time. David Watsky/CNETThat depends on the type of cooking you'll do and what other appliances you already have. I like having a solo air fryer, but I'm also a fan of the Instant Pot Duo Crisp which functions as both an air fryer and a multicooker (also a pressure cooker and slow cooker). Consider how the air fryer looks, too
Fritaire's glass bowl air fryer certainly is an eye catcher. FritaireAir fryers don't have to be kept on the counter but anything larger than 3 quarts might be tricky to store when not in use. Considering that, you should get an air fryer that compliments your kitchen. Both the Ninja and Cosori models are available in a range of colors (Cosori has more). There are also glass bowl air fryers and more modern-looking machines.

Air fryer FAQs
How do air fryers work?
The air fryer is a simple cooking machine that employs hot, fast-circulating convection heat and a small fan to flash-roast food inside a contained frying basket. While there's generally no or very little oil used, the results can be similar to those of traditional frying in that food comes out crispy on the outside and (ideally) moist on the inside.
Are air fryers energy efficient compared to ovens?
We did an analysis and found that a standard 4-quart air fryer will cost about 27 cents per hour to run. That's 50% more energy-efficient than the average full-size electric oven and about 35% more efficient than the average gas oven.
What can you make in an air fryer?
The options for foods you can cook in an air fryer are vast, but some air fryer favorites include chicken wings, chicken tenders, french fries and mozzarella sticks. You can also make fish in an air fryer, including salmon, for a moist inside and roasted outer crust. Bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs are great when made in an air fryer, as are certain vegetables like Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, onions, peppers and carrots.
Is using an air fryer healthier?
Generally speaking, air frying is a healthy way to cook. Cooking with an air fryer means you'll get foods that taste like they've been fried but with little or no oil. You can make healthier chicken wings, French fries, and cheese sticks without deep-frying or pan-frying in oil. Some foods do best in an air fryer with a light coating of oil, but most don't require any. Air fryers have become popular in part because they allow people to eat snack-type foods but with far less fat, cholesterol, and fewer calories.
Can you cook raw meat in an air fryer?
As long as the raw meat is fully defrosted, you can place and even cook it in an air fryer with very little trouble. However, we do recommend using baking paper under the meat (either by covering the tray, or cutting a fine piece of the paper to put under your food) so that the juice collected doesn't collect at the bottom of your air fryer.
