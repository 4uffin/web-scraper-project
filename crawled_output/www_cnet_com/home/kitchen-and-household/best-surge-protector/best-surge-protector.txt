Power surges can occur quickly and without warning, especially in the summer heat. They're often triggered by lightning strikes or electrical outages, and can cause serious damage to your electronics, as one CNET editor recently discovered. According to the Institute of Engineering and Technology, surge protectors are designed to help protect laptops, tablets, TVs and home appliances from power surge damage, though for even more protection and battery backup, you may want to consider an uninterruptible power supply or portable power station.

Factors to consider
With inflation and tariff-related price hikes hitting electronics hard, replacing your devices isn't as easy, so it's important to do what you can to keep them safe with a good surge protector. Unlike basic extension cords or power strips, surge protectors are specifically designed to absorb the excess energy from these dangerous voltage fluctuations before they reach your electronics. They're an essential piece of hardware that can prevent system crashes, extend your tech's life-span and even protect against electrical fires. We've rigorously tested 16 of the top surge protectors from brands like Belkin, Tripp, Anker and Amazon to find the best surge protection options.What is the best surge protector overall?The Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV is our overall pick for the top surge protector. It comes equipped with a long power cord, four wide-set outlets and eight close-spaced ones, along with a $150,000 equipment protection policy and one of the highest joule ratings we've seen for under $100. For those seeking surge protection with specific features or smaller sizes, we have more recommendations below worth checking out.Best 4 surge protectors of 2025Filter by

Best overall surge protector
Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV
Pros
RJ11 outlet
Very high joule rating
Lifetime insurance coverage
Plenty of ports/outlets
Cons
No USB
Pricey
Why I like it: The Tripp Lite TLP1208TELTV offers most of the features we liked in our previous but now-discontinued favorite, the APC P11U2. It has only four wide-set outlets but eight close-spaced ones. There's no USB, but you get three RJ11 for telephone (one in, two out) and two coax for cable or satellite. It has a claimed 2,880 joule rating. I have one in my testing lab.It has an 8-foot cord and comes with $150,000 "Ultimate Lifetime Insurance" coverage and a limited lifetime warranty. Who it's for: It's usually a little more expensive, but it's ideal if you want something to protect landlines or cable/satellite.Who shouldn't buy it: No USB ports, so it's not a good option if you're looking to protect devices that charge via USB only.

Best TV/home theater surge protector
Belkin Conserve Switch F7C01008q
Pros
Wireless switch
Comes with wall mount and sticky-tape
Compact size
Two 'always-on' outlets
Large warranty for connected devices
Cons
Lower joule rating
Shorter cord
Pricey
Why I like it: The Belkin F7C01008q has a handy feature: It comes with a wireless switch. Six of the eight wide-spaced outlets are controlled by this switch, which you can mount somewhere nearby via its included wall mount and sticky-tape. This allows you to stick the actual surge protector behind a large TV or console and you won't have to worry about reaching it to power on and off. The protector itself is flat, with far less bulk than the APC or Tripp Lite.Who it's for: This model is perfect for home theater setup with multiple power sources.Who shouldn't buy it: The more valuable the equipment, the more joules you'll need. This surge protector has a claimed 1,000-joule rating, which is lower than my top picks. For devices that store sensitive or valuable data, the Conserve Switch might not be the best option. However, it's important to note that the Conserve Switch has a $100,000 warranty for connected equipment. It has a shorter cord, too, though at 4 feet, it should be long enough for most situations.If you like the look of this design but don't need the switch, check out the Belkin BE112230, listed in the Others We Tested section below.   ...

Best small surge protector
Belkin BP108000
Pros
Rotates 180 degrees
One in and out RJ11 outlet
Connected equipment warranty
Unique shape
Cons
Grounded wall warts might not fit correctly
Why I like it: It has a claimed 1,800-joule rating and comes with a $150,000 Connected Equipment Warranty. In addition to the power outlets, there are also in-and-out RJ11 telephone connections. The cable to the wall is 6 feet long.Who it's for: Unlike most other surge protectors, the Belkin BP108000 is tubular instead of box-shaped. Long and thin, it can sit behind or under furniture better than most other designs. Seven of its nine AC outlets rotate almost 180 degrees, so you can fit big wall wart chargers on all of them. Who shouldn't buy it: The other two outlets are widely spaced from each other, but are close to the bottom of the protector. This won't be an issue if you're plugging in cables, but grounded wall warts might not fit correctly.   ... Show more

Best budget and on-wall surge protector
Amazon S9P658O300A00
Pros
Plugs directly into outlet
Outlets turn 90 degrees
Wall mount design
Cons
No warranty
Why I like it: The Amazon S9P658O300A00 plugs directly into your wall outlet, adding four more places for plugs. All six outlets on this Amazon Basics protector turn 90 degrees, so you can accommodate up to six wall warts if you turn the top and bottom plugs in the opposite direction of the middle ones. It's also super cheap compared to the other choices on this list. Who it's for: Use with small, inexpensive electronics like lamps, clocks or small appliances. Who shouldn't buy it: It doesn't have a connected equipment warranty and with a claimed joule rating of 1,080 joules, it's not the best choice for valuable or expensive equipment.

How I tested surge protectors
Chris Monroe/CNETWhen I tested these surge protectors there were three things I looked for: 1. Well-spaced sockets: One of the most important things was having enough outlets to fit the wall wart power adapters that come with most products. These bulky connectors usually take up two or more spaces on normal outlets and power strips. I physically checked each power strip to see if its outlets were sufficiently spaced to fit multiple warts.2. A high joule rating (preferably 1,000 or more): Joule ratings indicate how much energy a surge protector can absorb before failing. It's essentially a measure of how much protection each surge protector will offer you. A rating was required, and all my picks had ratings comparable to or higher than their competitors. It'd be great to have a minimum or recommended rating, but such a thing doesn't exist for these kinds of products. 3. Whether it came with a "connected device" warranty: I also gave preference to products that come with a guarantee in case your gear is destroyed by a power surge. Nearly all of my picks have this kind of warranty, often in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Are you likely to get your money back if your gear gets zapped? Hard to say. Insurance like this is hard to collect on, as some companies will only replace connected gear "at their option." Having this sort of guarantee does give you some peace of mind, however; more than you have without it, and perhaps it will cover you in a way your homeowners or renters insurance doesn't. With all of this in mind, I compiled a list of nearly 50 surge protectors and then chose the top 16 to test. My last bit of testing was hands-on. Specs can tell you a lot, but very quickly I found some of these to be better than others. Some had features that seemed useful but weren't. Others were larger or smaller than they seemed in pictures, which in some cases was a good thing or in the case of the travel surge protectors, not so much. Our top picks were the ones that had the best combination of features, specs and felt the most practical in normal use.Read more: 10 Shocking Facts About Power Strips

Other good surge protectors
Accell D080B-051B (Out of stock): It looks like a squid or maybe a six-legged octopus. (Hexapus?) I feel like this is enough reason to buy it, but it may not be for everyone. Its main benefit is that, instead of rigid outlets on a flat frame like most surge protectors, it has five short cables with the outlets at the end. The Accell is rated at a claimed 1,080 joules. Most surge protectors will continue to pass power when they've passed their joule rating, but the D080B-051B has a fail safe, cutting power so your gear is protected against further surges. You will need to buy a new one if this should happen, but the whole point is to protect your more expensive gear. It's surprising that more surge protectors aren't built like this. Most people probably won't need this specific type of functionality, but I'm sure some of you are looking at it and know exactly how it will fit in your home. Unlike the others on my list, there's no connected device warranty -- meaning the company doesn't have a program to replace your fried devices should it occur. Although with Accell's unique fail-safe, you might not need it.The Belkin SRA007p12tt6 is a classy-looking 12-outlet surge protector with a matte-white finish that would work better on a desk or otherwise visible spot than most of the other large protectors. Six of its outlets are widely spaced, and there are two 2.4-amp USB-A and one 3-amp USB-C outlet (4.5 amps combined max output). The wall plug is conveniently angled at 90 degrees at the end of the 6-foot cable.The APC P6WU2 (Update: Currently Unavailable) is a chunky wall-mount design with six side-mounted outlets and two USB ports on the front. Depending on what you're plugging into it, they might bunch up or not fit against the wall. The Amazon S9P658O300A00 can fit more plugs for a somewhat similar footprint. However, the APC has a connected device warranty ($50,000), while the Amazon doesn't. For something similar but smaller, check out the Belkin BSV300ttCW mentioned below.The Belkin BE112230 shares the flat design of the switched Belkin F7C01008q, just without the switch. It has six wide-spaced outlets, a claimed 3,940 joules of protection and a connected equipment warranty.The Belkin BST300bg is a decent travel alternative to the Accell. It has three outlets on the front and two USB ports on the top. The plug swivels so you can orient it in multiple ways. The Accell is a little smaller, but this is a good runner-up.The wall-mounted Belkin BSV300ttCW has three outlets and two USB ports, all on the front. Its most interesting design feature is a lipped top surface where you can lean your phone while it's charging.The cube-shaped Belkin SRA006p3tt5 is similar to the currently unavailable Anker in that it's a small protector at the end of a long cord. The Anker's smaller size and dedicated USB-C connection are more convenient, but if you're connecting larger wall warts, they'll likely fit better on this. What's the difference between a surge protector and a power strip?
A surge protector controls and diverts excess power to keep your electronics safe, while a power strip simply offers more outlets to plug stuff in. Raimund Koch/Getty ImagesA power strip and surge protector may look similar, but the power strip will not offer surge protection for appliances and devices plugged into it. Plug-in surge protectors work by absorbing and diverting a surge. The excess voltage is sent to the outlet's ground wire -- the third prong in modern electrical sockets -- and prevented from reaching any devices that are plugged into that socket.  A power strip will simply give you more outlets to plug in electronics.The easiest way to tell the difference between a basic strip and a surge protector is by checking if it has a joule rating. All surge protectors will have one, and it's essentially how much of a power surge it can protect against. Factors to consider
Get more outlets than you think you need. Generally, the next size up from what you’re considering will give you room to grow if you need to add new gear or devices down the road.Two might be better than one. If you’re connecting enough devices to fill a surge protector, it’s worth considering getting two smaller ones (say, two eights instead of one 12). Spreading out the electrical load could be safer. Even more practical, it also might allow you to connect to two different outlets. This is especially important if you’re connecting a lot of high-power devices. Of course, this isn’t always possible, but it’s worth considering. Make sure it's within reach. An easily reachable power switch, or even a wireless remote, can seem like a simple thing but one that can improve usability significantly. A surge protector isn't always enough. If your location is prone to lightning strikes, you’ll want more protection than just a surge protector. Using a surge protector to protect against lightning is like using a baby gate to stop an elephant.
Surge protector FAQs
Do I need a surge protector when traveling?
Need? No, but it doesn't hurt to protect your gear. More important when traveling is having enough outlets to connect all your electronics. You'd be surprised at how few accessible outlets many hotels have.
Is it bad to plug too many things into a surge protector?
Yes, though depending on what you're trying to connect, it might not matter. The outlets in most American homes are either 15 or 20 amps. This equals approximately 1,800 to 2,400 watts. Can you connect your TV, soundbar and game consoles to one surge protector? Generally, yes. Can you connect your fridge, air conditioner, electric stove and clothes dryer to one? No. Check the wattage rating on your gear. You're better off using more surge protectors, plugged into their own separate outlets.
Can a surge protector protect against lightning?
No. If lightning strikes your house, a surge protector will unlikely do anything to save your gear. There would just be too much power to handle. Some surge protectors have warranties that might cover some of the cost of your gear in the case of a lightning strike, but not all. It's best to read the fine print. Lighting protection has to involve redirection, for example with a lightning rod, which is beyond the scope of this guide.
Is an expensive surge protector worth it?
To an extent, yes. Generally, more expensive surge protectors have higher joule ratings (more protection) and better equipment protection policies if something happens. Surge protectors with higher prices might include options like uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), which are essentially surge protectors with built-in batteries, and whole-home surge protection.
What’s the difference between a power strip and a surge protector?
The difference between a power strip and a surge protector is that a power strip is just additional outlets, while a surge protector has additional circuitry to help protect your TV, soundbar or anything that's plugged in. While the terms are used interchangeably, there's a big difference.
Can I plug a surge protector into an extension cord?
It's generally not recommended to plug a surge protector into an extension cord. Ideally, a surge protector should be plugged directly into a wall outlet to prevent voltage drops, overloading and for overall better protection.
