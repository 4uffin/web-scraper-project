FAQs
Electric cars are going mainstream. What began as a trickle of niche EVs just a few years ago has become a downpour -- electric vehicles are now the fastest-growing segment of the automotive industry. Over the last 16 years, I've evaluated and driven hundreds of cars, trucks and SUVs for review here at CNET. I've also driven just about every mass-market electric vehicle ever sold in the US and even some that have yet to hit the road. In this list, I've used that experience to help you understand what you should look for in a good electric car, how these battery-powered machines work, and where the technology is heading in the future, near and far.   With the Biden-Harris administration's plans to build 500,000 EV chargers nationwide, tough new EPA emissions standards and certain states eyeing new combustion car bans as early as 2030, automakers and consumers alike have turned more focus toward the adoption and growth of plug-in cars by the end of this decade. Today, more than two dozen automakers offer combined 40-plus full-electric models boasting over 200 miles of range, unique high-tech features and performance that outclasses comparable gasoline-powered models. If you're thinking about buying an electric car, there have never been more choices for you than there are today. Here's how to navigate them -- starting with CNET's best overall electric car.
What is the best overall electric car?
Enlarge Image
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y are the 800-pound gorillas of current EV landscape. TeslaThere aren't just more EVs to choose from. There's also a wider gamut of available cruising ranges, prices, performance and luxury options, allowing prospective buyers to fine-tune their choice to meet their specific needs and budget. Whether you're looking for basic transportation for zero-emissions commuting or a high-end technology showcase for road-tripping, there's an EV that fits the bill.
Of the EVs available today, Tesla's Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV offer the best balance, broadest appeal and thanks to their full qualification for federal EV tax credits, some of the best values for most drivers looking to make the jump to electric motoring. Identical in every way other than interior volume, the Models 3 and Y boast more than enough range to tackle a week of commuting on a single charge -- 358 and 330 miles, respectively -- or a long road trip with minimal stops for charging. As Tesla vehicles, the Model 3 and the Model Y SUV also have native access to the Supercharger network, the most widespread and reliable DC fast charging network in the nation. They're by no means perfect -- CNET editors certainly had their share of issues with our long-term Model Y -- but those problems are balanced out by Tesla's consistent over-the-air software improvements and their best-in-class performance.
Best electric cars of 2025
Tesla
2024 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range
Best electric car for most people
Starting at $41,630, the 2023 Tesla Model 3 Standard Range is a tough act to follow, costing less than some combustion-powered sedans in its class once the dust settles after up to a $7,500 federal tax credit and any qualifying state EV incentives. Shoppers with a bit more room in the budget can opt to upgrade to longer-ranging and more powerful dual-motor variants, but this configuration's 272 miles is plenty for year-round daily driving with the occasional road trip, while its efficiency (4 miles per kWh) is the third highest on the road today, keeping operating costs low.The Standard Range battery is mated with a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive variant of Tesla's electric powertrain. Its 0 to 60 mph sprint of 5.8 seconds won't snap your neck, but it's more than quick enough for strong, silent merges and passing. Plus, it's available with all of the cutting-edge dashboard technology and driver aid tech offered on the automaker's more expensive models.ProsExcellent performance, the highest range for the priceAffordable price bolstered by federal tax incentivesNative access to Supercharger fast charging networkConsDashboard tech moves too many basic features to the touchscreenReputation of inconsistent build quality Expensive Autopilot and FSD driver aid tech upgrades Additional AttributesRange: 272 milesEfficiency: 4 mi/kWh, 132 mpgeMax DCFC: 250 kW, 10 to 80% in 18 minutesFeatures: Available FSD driver aid, connected 15.4-inch dashboard displayStarting price: $41,630

2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5
Our favorite electric car
2024
The angular Ioniq 5 was our first brush with Hyundai Motor Group's E-GMP electric vehicle platform -- which also underpins the Kia's EV6 and EV9 and the Genesis GV60 -- and years later it continues to be one of our favorite electric vehicles in its class. In its thriftiest Long Range RWD configuration, the Ioniq 5 cruises up to 303 miles and covers 3.4 miles per kilowatt-hour. That's an EPA-estimated equivalent of 114 mpge.Beyond simply being thrifty, the Ioniq 5's battery-electric platform enables up to 236-kW DC fast charging making it one of the fastest-charging EVs we've tested. Plus, optional V2L 120-volt AC power delivery lets you use stored battery power outside of the EV while parked for a variety of applications.And, yes, Hyundai's own Ioniq 6 is a bit more efficient with a bit more range (361 miles), but I prefer the 5's sharply styled large hatchback design to the 6 sedan's lozenge silhouette. Either option is a good one, but more room for cargo in roughly the same footprint is a big win, I say.ProsMelds handsome hatchback design with small SUV cargo spaceComes standard with excellent, but not overwhelming dashboard techStandard V2L bidirectional charging port (adapter required)Cons Does not currently qualify for federal plug-in incentive No front trunkAdditional AttributesRange: 303 milesEfficiency: 3.4 mi/kWh, 114 mpgeMax DCFC: 236 kW, 10 to 80% in 18 minutesFeatures:
Standard V2L bidirectional charging, wired Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, available Remote Smart ParkingStarting price: $43,195

Rivian
2024 Rivian R1T
Best electric truck
2024
Rivian's fun-loving R1T electric pickup was recently updated with even more powerful dashboard technology, smarter connectivity and subtle exterior design revisions. Joining the already potent lineup of dual- and tri-motor configurations for this refresh is a new quad-motor option with a truly monstrous capacity for acceleration and new battery tech that promises even better range and performance than before.The new R1T Dual Max configuration -- which I've previously called the sweet spot in the lineup -- now rolls for up to 420 miles between recharges. Rivian also turned on compatibility with the NACS standard (via a free adapter) this year, giving drivers access to Tesla's Supercharger network in addition to hundreds of CCS-compatible stations, including Rivian's outdoor-focused Adventure Network.The Rivian R1T is the perfect electric pickup for eco-adventurers eager to explore the great outdoors. Its silent, but extremely capable electric powertrain lets you tackle trails while enjoying the sounds of nature, which is a unique and rewarding experience. The pickup is packed with unique features -- from the customizable gear tunnel to its playful dashboard tech -- that make you feel like you can (and should) go anywhere. Those features make it equally appealing for suburban drivers looking for a zero-emissions vehicle with more rugged utility than an SUV.ProsMassive front trunk and unique gear tunnel storageUpdated dashboard tech features fun, intuitive design and advanced connectivityUpdated powertrain options offer improved range and mind-bending performanceConsCurrently lacks the bidirectional power functionality found on other electric pickupsIt's pricey for a pickupAdditional AttributesRange: up to 420 milesEfficiency: 2.5 mi/kWh, 84 mpgeMax DCFC: 220 kW, 10 to 80% in 41 minutesFeatures: Rivian Gear Tunnel storage, Gear Guard camera system, Highway and Lane Change Assist, Google Cast media streaming while parkedStarting price: $71,700

2024 Kia EV9
Best three-row electric SUV
2024
I love the adventure-oriented (and recently updated) Rivian R1S, but Kia's new three-row electric EV9 feels, in many ways, like a better fit for families seeking an urban utility vehicle. Tipping the scales are little things, like the EV9's surprisingly low step in height, which makes getting in and out and loading cargo and car seats super easy, and larger factors like Kia's lower starting price of $56,395. The EV9 also features a more conventional suite of dashboard and driver-aid technologies inherited from Kia's family of EVs, PHEVs and combustion cars. "Conventional" may sound like a backhand compliment, but I appreciated how familiar and easy to use the EV9's tech was during my multiple times behind the wheel. Plus, the EV9 supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, giving drivers the flexibility to customize their dashboard experience -- a critical advantage in a vehicle that may be shared with multiple drivers.SUV shoppers will have the choice of two battery sizes and three electric motor configurations, ranging from the 304-mile Light RWD (the longest-ranging spec in the line) to the 379hp GT-Line AWD which leaps from 0-60 mph in just 5.0 seconds -- which is plenty quick for a family hauler. Plus, the EV9 is one of the fastest charging EVs I've tested in this class, able to scramble from 10-80% optimally in around 24 minutes at a 350-kW DC charger. I'm also a huge fan of the EV9's V2L bidirectional power feature that allows the EV's battery to keep critical appliances running during a home power outage with an inexpensive, easy-to-use adapter (and an extension cord.)ProsBold, eye-catching designAvailable battery and e-motor configurations offer plenty of flexibility for various budgetary, range and performance needsOptional V2L bidirectional power adds utility at home during power outages, as well as at campsites and tailgate partiesConsFrunk storage area is only big enough for the power cableSubscription and paid DLC features feels like a slippery slopeAdditional AttributesRange: 304 milesEfficiency: 2.6 mi/kWh, 89 mpgeMax DCFC: 236 kW, 10-80% in 24 min.Features: V2L bidirectional power, Remote Smart Parking Assist, Android Auto/Apple CarPlayStarting price: $56,395

Hyundai
2024 Hyundai Kona Electric
Best affordable electric car
Yes, the Nissan Leaf is cheaper but it's so woefully outdated that it's difficult to recommend to all but the most miserly shoppers with the humblest of range requirements. Meanwhile, for not much more, Hyundai's freshly overhauled Kona Electric makes a strong case for your attention matching a modern suite of driver aid, safety and convenience technologies with a handsome, futuristic aesthetic.The entry-level SE model features a 48.6 kWh battery good for around 200 miles of range. Stepping up to the SEL spec (which I highly recommend) increases capacity to 64.8 kWh, range to 261 miles and for good measure, bumps the output to 201 hp (up from 133 ponies.) The Kona Electric also features DC fast charging via the more widely available CCS standard at up to 100 kW -- far from the fastest, but good enough for a roadside 10-80% charge in under 45 minutes. I also love that, like the Leaf, the Kona's charging port is located on the EV's nose, which I think is the most convenient spot for public charging.ProsSmall, but surprisingly spaciousPretty good urban driving rangeCentral charging port is super convenient for public chargingCons100 kW charging speed is faster than previous generation, but still a touch sluggishSmall SUV doesn't offer an all-wheel drive optionAdditional AttributesRange: up to 261 milesEfficiency: 3.45 mi/kWh, 118 mpgeMax DCFC: 100 kW, 10 to 80% in 43 minutesFeatures: Hyundai SmartSense driver aid suite, wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, optional Digital Key smartphone access, optional Remote Smart Parking AssistStarting price: $34,070

Lucid Air
EVs with the most range, highest energy efficiency
California-based EV startup Lucid recently announced updates to its Air electric luxury sedan that make it the most energy efficient EV you can buy today by a country mile. Aerodynamic, battery and powertrain improvements elevate the Lucid Air Pure configuration to an amazing 5.0 miles per kilowatt hour -- the equivalent of an EPA estimated 146 mpge -- nearly 20% higher than the next most efficient EV, Hyundai's Ioniq 6. (That said, the Lucid starts at $71,400, almost double the price of the much smaller Hyundai.)Elsewhere in the lineup, the Lucid Air also takes the electric car endurance crown with its 516-mile Lucid Air Grand Touring. To accomplish this feat, Lucid stuffed its large sedan with a massive 112-kWh battery pack, wrapped it in an impressive aerodynamic design that helps it cut through the air with very little drag and compact electric motors with an efficiency of 3.8 kilowatt-hours per mile. If you're ever not feeling particularly thrifty, the dual-motor Air also boasts impressive performance with over 800 hp and 3.0-second 0-to-60 mph sprint. The 2024 Lucid Air Grand Touring tips the scales at $138,000, and that's not even the most expensive spec.ProsGrand Touring boasts the most range of any EV on sale todayPure is the most energy efficient EV by a significant marginTons of storage space including two full-size trunksWicked fast 3.0 second 0-to-60 mphNow available with wireless Apple CarPlayConsExtremely expensiveAwkward dashboard tech, no Android AutoLimited driver-aid tech relative to competitors at this priceAdditional AttributesRange: up to 516 miles (Grand Touring)Efficiency: up to 5.0 mi/kWh, 146 mpge (Pure)Max DCFC: 300 kW, 10-80% in 16 min.Features: 34-inch curved main display, Wireless AppleCarPlay, Alexa voice commandStarting price: $71,400 (Pure)

BMW
2024 BMW i7 xDrive60
Best luxury electric car
The new i7 is BMW's flagship electric sedan, hitting the road with 536 horsepower, 549 pound-feet of torque and every gadget and gizmo in the German automaker's arsenal. The i7 boasts up to 318 miles of electric range, features generated electric motor tones composed by Hans Zimmer and is one of the first Bimmers available with the automaker's updated Highway Assistant, which provides Level 2 hands-free driving at speeds up to 85 mph.Inside, you'll find perhaps the most opulent cabin that BMW has ever assembled, with crystal controls, high-quality leather and cashmere trim. If you think the dual 12.3-inch and 14.9-inch dashboard displays are huge, wait until you get a gander at the 31.3-inch 8K BMW Theater Screen that folds down from the ceiling to entertain rear seat passengers with Amazon Fire TV apps powered by 5G data.ProsLarge and luxuriousLong range and fast charging are great for longer haulsAvailable with BMW's first hands-free Highway Assistant techOne of the best rear-seat entertainment screens in the businessConsLess range than Lucid or TeslaAdditional AttributesRange: 324 milesEfficiency: 2.63 mi/kWh, 89 mpgeMax DCFC: 195 kW, 10 to 80% in 34 minutesFeatures: BMW Highway Assistant, hands-free soft close doors, 31.3-inch 8K BMW Theater 5G rear seat entertainment with Amazon Fire TVStarting price: $125,195

2024 Tesla Model Y Long Range AWD
Best small electric SUV
The Tesla Model Y is everything that EV enthusiasts love about the Tesla Model 3 with a bit more cargo space. The Y's taller seating position, extra headroom and additional cargo capacity have made it slightly more popular than its sibling, narrowly edging out the Model 3 as the best-selling electric car in America. Heavier and with a larger aerodynamic profile than the 3, the Model Y can roam up to 330 miles per charge. That's enough to stand head and shoulders above the rest of the class. Add to that access to Tesla's extensive and, more importantly, reliable Supercharger public charging network and the promise of constant improvement via over-the-air updates (that is, software updates to enhance performance) and it's no wonder the Model Y sells so well. Like the smaller Model 3, the Tesla Model Y also recently regained qualification for the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, bringing its starting price to an adjusted $41,630.ProsNative access to Tesla Supercharger networkMassive range for the moneyMore spacious than Model 3ConsControversial Autopilot and FSD driver aid tech are expensive upgradesReputation for subpar build qualityAdditional attributesRange: 330 milesEfficiency: 3.85 mi/kWh, 123 mpgeMax DCFC: 210 kW, 10 to 80% in 17 minutesFeatures: Available FSD driver aid, connected 15.4-inch dashboard display, optional third-row seatingStarting price: $51,880

2024 Porsche Taycan GTS
Best electric sports car
The Porsche Taycan is expensive (it's a Porsche, after all) and its range falls short of the class-leading Tesla Model S, but there's more to enjoying an EV than just range. Driving a Taycan tells a completely different story, and I'm confident that the sweet spot GTS model is the most fun you can have in a sporty EV today. With 590 horsepower in this spec and a 3.5-second 0 to 60 mph sprint, the Taycan GTS is quick, but it also corners and connects to the road with precision like no other EV I've ever driven. The build quality, much like its driving dynamics, is basically unbeatable.The range, officially estimated at 246 miles for the Taycan GTS, is more than adequate for daily driving, but it's also not difficult to exceed that when driving with a light foot. We reckon Porsche is underpromising here so that it can overdeliver on the real-world range.

Factors to consider before buying an EVRange: How far an electric car can go on a single charge is usually the first number shoppers check when considering an electric vehicle. Longer range means fewer stops on long trips and more peace of mind between charging stations on the road. Considering the national rollout of charging stations has proceeded slower than expected, this is a valid concern. Range can also be significantly affected by factors such as extremely cold or hot weather, along with your driving habits. Plus, all batteries will degrade somewhat over the lifespan of the vehicle, so consider picking an EV with a bit of extra wiggle room in the battery pack. Range is important to the driving experience, but it may not be the most important number on the spec sheet.  Efficiency: The most overlooked number on an EV's spec sheet, but I think it's the most important for a daily driver. Efficiency tells you how much electricity an electric car, truck or SUV uses when cruising, measured in miles per kilowatt-hour or kilowatt-hours per 100 miles. With this number and your local energy rates, you can easily calculate how much it costs to operate an EV and how much you could potentially save compared to a conventional combustion car.

An EV's maximum DC fast charging speed can have a big impact on how long a road trip takes. Antuan Goodwin/CNETCharging: Most EVs can recharge overnight at a level 2 home AC charger, and starting each day with a full battery can eliminate a lot of range anxiety.  But for long road trips (or for apartment dwellers who can't recharge their EV every night), an EV's DC fast charging experience can have an even larger impact on EV ownership than its range. Most EVs I recommend can cover at least 200 miles between stops, but DC charging speed can mean the difference between that being a quick 20-minute break or being stuck waiting for up to an hour. You'll also want to consider what EV charging networks (Tesla Superchargers, Electrify America, Rivian's Adventure Network and others) cover your most beaten paths.  Features: An electric car is more than just a battery, motors and a charging port. It's also a car, which means it needs to be a good car that meets your needs for passenger and cargo capacity, cabin technology, safety and driver-aid technologies and style. Some EVs even offer bidirectional charging, which allows owners to draw power from an EV's battery pack while parked, keeping the lights on at home during a blackout or powering a camp, work site or tailgate party.
How we test electric cars I've driven almost every EV model sold in the US over the last 15 years -- from the 62-mile 2012 Mitsubishi i-Miev to the 516-mile Lucid Air Grand Touring -- but the process always starts by getting behind the wheel and driving them in real-world conditions on public roads. For each car I test, I cover over 200 miles behind the wheel on a mixed driving route that includes dense urban roads (complete with potholes), long stretches of highway driving and some good fun twisty mountain roads mixed in for flavor.  On the road, I test the DC fast charging speed and experience, evaluate driving dynamics including handling, acceleration and braking performance and also compare my real-world experience, tested range and efficiency with estimates reported by the US EPA, both to double-check the official numbers against the real world and to make sure my experiences represent those of the typical American driver. Along the way, I also check each car's cabin comfort, dashboard tech and driver aid and safety features to get a feel for where each vehicle fits in my experience testing hundreds of combustion, hybrid, hydrogen and yes, battery-powered cars for CNET reviews.

I've been reviewing cars and car technology at CNET for over 15 years. Antuan Goodwin/CNET Other EVs we tested I've fallen head over heels for our long-term 2022 Kia EV6 Wind AWD, which has a similar powertrain and performance to Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6. I prefer the look and suspension tuning of the EV6 to its cousins, but would probably recommend the Ioniq 5 to EV newbies for one reason: It comes with a charging cable. The EV6 does not, which means you'll need to source your own. The Kia does, however, include Hyundai/Kia's flexible V2L bidirectional charging adapter, which is nice. Volkswagen's ID.4 boasts solid range, performance and value and is more spacious than other electric SUVs in its class. However, awkward dashboard touch controls and strange ergonomic design decisions -- such as the omission of rear window switches on the back doors -- kept it from clicking with me. I also enjoyed my time piloting BMW's iX and, particularly, the i4 M50. Both are excellent options for drivers looking for luxurious alternatives to Tesla's Model Y and Model 3, but they each have a more conventional dashboard design, more premium fit and finish and more driver-focused performance.

How much range should I look for in an electric car?
How much range you'll need from an EV will vary depending on your individual needs and driving habits. For most drivers with an average American commute -- around 55.2 miles according to the most recent US Census Bureau data -- an EV in the 200- to 300-mile ballpark will provide adequate range for daily driving, unexpected errands and the occasional road trip. This leaves some wiggle room for apartment dwellers, who may not be able to charge every night and for drivers who live in areas with extreme heat or cold weather, which can sap as much as 41% of EV's stated range in the most extreme cases. Check out our explainer on how much range to target when buying an electric car.

How long does it take to charge an electric car?
Broadly, there are three levels of EV charging that you need to know. DC fast charging is the fastest charging method used by public charging networks, such as Electrify America, EVgo or Tesla Superchargers, getting you from 10 to 80% full (the most efficient range for fast charging) in as little as 18 minutes or up to an hour. Level 2 home or public stations average around 9.6 kW, getting you around a day's worth of driving with an overnight session. Level 1 chargers plug into the familiar NEMA 5-15 home outlet -- the same one your TV or laptop uses -- and can take from 12 to 24 hours to trickle charge at Level 1, making this only really useful as a last expedient when there are no other options.

Are electric cars more expensive than gas-powered cars?
Within the same class, EVs tend to be more expensive than their combustion-powered cousins due to the rare and costly materials that make up their large battery packs. Economies of scale and new production processes could eventually result in at the point of purchase price parity, but for now, prospective buyers will want to look to any available federal and state tax incentives or rebates to offset the cost. Additionally, EVs can be less expensive to operate, potentially saving money over the long term.

Are electric cars as safe as gas-powered cars?
A battery's weight could affect handling and braking distance, and an inexperienced driver could be caught off guard by an EV's strong acceleration, but those aren't risks unique to electric cars. On the other hand, EVs often use the most modern driver-aid technologies and passive safety features in an automaker's portfolio, which can tip the safety scales in their favor.Electric cars do require first responders to handle them differently in the event of an accident or fire. Despite a few high-profile fire-risk recalls, however, multiple studies show that EVs are actually significantly less likely to catch fire than combustion cars.

Are electric cars better for the environment than gas-powered cars?
Lacking tailpipe emissions, the transition to electric cars can greatly improve local air quality. In areas where electricity is generated with fossil or carbon-based fuels, EVs will still have a macro environmental impact. Factor in the mining of rare battery and motor materials and the answer becomes less clear. Many major automakers have pledged to build carbon-neutral supply chains, factories and manufacturing processes, which could further reduce EVs' global environmental impact. Meanwhile, moving regional electrical grids to renewable sources while individual homes make use of rooftop solar generation can make an electric car more and more environmentally friendly over its lifetime.
