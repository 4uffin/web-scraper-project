The right home security tech can move with you -- here are my top picks. ABRAHAM GONZALEZ FERNANDEZ via Getty
When investing in home security technology, you need to make sure it will help you out for years to come. But that's difficult to guarantee if you're planning a move or if you move frequently, like a military family or house flipper. Fortunately, there are home security devices that let you keep your investment and pack them up when it's time for a new home. I've rounded up the best security technology that you can take with you, from retrofit smart locks to adhesive-based security systems that are move-friendly and affordable. Use devices like these so you'll never have to leave security behind. Read more: Is It Legal to Install a Security Camera in an Apartment Building? Arlo's 8-in-1 Sensor Security System
Arlo sensors can do nearly anything and are easy to move whenever you want. ArloSee at AmazonArlo's security system is different from any other system we've tested: It's made for easy placement and relocation whenever necessary, with eight-in-one sensors that can do anything, anywhere you put them. The sensors attach with adhesive so they're easy to place and remove as needed. Combine them with an Arlo hub, and they can measure motion, noise, water leaks, light, heat and more. Add an Arlo subscription and you can get better alerts or even opt for professional home monitoring.
Arlo's all-in-one sensors are especially easy to pack up and move to any location depending on what your new home looks like, so it's our top suggestion for people with flexible living situations. You can find a five-pack system for complete protection, or you could buy the hub and each sensor separately depending on your needs and budget.
Best Outdoor Home Security Cameras for 2025
See at Cnet
SimpliSafe: The Starter kit
SimpliSafe makes its devices easy to remove and relocate. SimpliSafeSee at SimpliSafeFor a more traditional home security system, SimpliSafe is affordable and offers adhesive sensors that are easy to remove and take with you when moving. The Essentials package is one of the best kits with a few different entry sensors and a motion sensor to place as needed. I've tested SimpliSafe packages before and am impressed not only with their design but with how easy they are to set up (although you may need to buy more sticky tape when the time comes to replace).Everything in this SimpliSafe package is DIY, wireless and doesn't require any contracts -- all ideal for frequent movers. Their subscriptions are very affordable compared to companies like ADT and offer advanced home monitoring options.
Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam
Ring's new cam offers pan and tilt features, along with some welcome upgrades to the Ring Protect plan.  RingSee at AmazonRing's latest camera offers a simple substitute for a full security system that clocks in at under $100 and is easy to set up -- well, wherever you want indoors. The wired cam's pan and tilt features let it look out over an entire room or open floor plan to watch multiple access points or follow the action. It also comes with a physical privacy cover and activity zones for additional customization.
The HD camera also comes with Ring technology for color night vision and two-way talk capabilities (plus a siren). Keep in mind, you'll need a Ring Home plan ($5 a month) for video storage and smart alerts. If you want to avoid a subscription, Eufy's pan and tilt camera ($130) is a similar option with a higher resolution and onboard storage.
Google Nest Doorbell (2nd-gen, battery)
Google's Nest Doorbells are effective, easy to install and don't nickel-and-dime you like some doorbells do. GoogleSee at AmazonGoogle's Nest battery doorbell is a compact way to view your front door and get free alerts about any people or packages. Add in a Nest Aware subscription and it can even recognize familiar faces that you save to your Google Home app. Recharging is as easy as taking it down and hooking the doorbell up to a charger overnight, after which it will last for three to four months.
Installation is very light for a video doorbell, requiring only a couple of screw holes in nearby trim or siding, so unscrewing and moving the model is easier than nearly any other doorbell we've tested.  If that's still too much damage for renters, you may want to look at Ring's Peephole Cam, a video doorbell that replaces your peephole with no screws needed.
Yale Approach Smart Lock (retrofit)
Yale's retrofit and adhesive keypad are great choices for renters or those on the move. YaleSee at AmazonIf you're moving homes, getting a new deadbolt isn't always possible (especially for renters) or easy. But there's another smart lock option -- the retrofit, which fits over an existing deadbolt, modifying it with smart features without changing too much. One of my current favorites is Yale's Approach model, which is available under $100 and provides app controls, including the ability to share virtual keys and keep a history of activities.While Yale's lock doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it does have important features like auto-locking and it's comparatively affordable. Plus, it's relatively simple to take off and pack when you're ready to move as long as you keep the old thumb turn component in a storage drawer. It also works with both Amazon Alexa and Google Home/Gemini. For remote features, which I really like, you will need an additional Yale Connect plug-in device.
Can I move a security system with adhesive strips? Yes, adhesive strip sensors and cams are the easiest to move. Careful peeling (sometimes with the help of heat and a paint edger) can dismount one of the devices in short order, with minimal damage -- although renters will want to be wary of potential drywall paint stains.
You can't reuse the same old adhesive strips in a new location, but fortunately most security devices use universal 3M adhesive patches that you can easily order. Adhesive installation works best on smooth, flat surfaces like metal, boards or glass, but we've see some good results on carefully-cleaned exterior siding. If your home security device mount is screwed in, you can usually unscrew it by loosening the screws with a screwdriver and then using the reverse setting on a drill. But you will leave holes behind so you  Best Floodlight Home Security Cameras of 2025

How do I pack security devices for a move?
Pack security cameras carefully. Pack them just as you would for any sensitive electronics. Cushion them thoroughly in a box with padding like towels and bubble wrap. Wrap each individual sensor separately, and fill in spaces so they don't have room to jostle around.
Avoid using bubble wrap, newspaper or rough towels against the lenses of security cameras, as they could damage them. Wrap the lenses in a felt cleaning cloth or similar material first. If you have the original boxes, use those. Some brands like SimpliSafe offer moving kits especially for transporting your system. With security technology that's ready to move with you, stop by our articles on the places to never install a home security cam and the top cameras without subscription fees.
