Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Sadly, many consumers lose billions of dollars every year because of the ubiquity of suspicious online activity. Anyone can fall victim to online scams or insecure sites. But using a VPN is a simple way to make sure your credit card, identity and other information stay protected as you pay bills, log into trusted sites and more.We've found an assortment of top VPN providers offering discounts when you sign up for yearly, two-year and longer terms. Unsure which VPN is right for you? Check out our roundup of top-rated VPN services you can count on to maintain your privacy, keep your data safe from prying eyes and even take better advantage of streaming subscriptions.Best VPN dealsCNET's team of experts tested and reviewed the VPNs in this group. We can broadly recommend them with the caveats noted below. The fast-changing ownership landscape in the VPN market may continue to shake things up but we'll continue to update this list as we uncover more.
ExpressVPN: $3.49 a month for 28 months Devices: Up to 8Refund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysExpressVPN still tops our list of the best VPNs and you can save on a subscription by going for its 24-month plan, which also gets you four months free, dropping the average price to just $3.49 a month, paid as $98 upfront. You can step up to the Advanced plan with a few more perks for just under $4.49 a month, paid as $126, or go all-out for the Pro plan for $7.49 a month, paid as $209. We evaluate VPNs based on their overall performance in three main categories: speed, security and price. Express isn't the cheapest, but it's among the fastest and the most secure so far, even after its acquisition by Kape Technologies.

Surfshark: $2 a month for 27 months Devices: UnlimitedRefund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysSurfshark, a relative newcomer to the VPN market, has quickly become known for its speed, which is why it's one of our VPN experts' top picks. Surfshark also supports unlimited devices, which is great for large households. Currently, all the plans are discounted by up to 87%. If you commit to 27 months of Surfshark Starter VPN right now, you'll be billed $54 upfront for 27 months, averaging $2 a month.If you want a few more perks, you can try Surfshark One, which sets you back just less than $2.50 a month or an up-front payment of $67 for 27 months. This gives you some added features, like a private search engine and 24/7 virus protection. In a similar deal, you can get Surfshark One Plus for just $4 a month for a 27-month subscription. This will be billed at $114 upfront. You'll get everything the other two packages offer, plus data removal from companies' databases and people-search websites. Surfshark merged with rival NordVPN in 2022, although the companies continue to operate independently.

NordVPN: $3 a month for 27 months Devices: Up to 10Refund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysAn industry heavyweight and still one of CNET's top picks, NordVPN has some substantial savings right now, with up to 73% off its plans supporting up to 10 devices. The basic two-year plan is $67 upfront for 27 months. If you want the upgraded Plus plan, with its added malware, ad-blocking and password management tools, you can get a two-year subscription (plus three free months) for just $87, which works out to about $4 a month. There's also the Complete plan, which is just less than $5 a month and is billed as $108 upfront. As we noted, NordVPN and Surfshark have merged but have continued to operate autonomously so far.

Proton VPN: $3 a month for 24 months Devices: Up to 10Refund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysProton VPN is the only free VPN we recommend but if you need more functionality, you can upgrade to Proton VPN Plus for $3 a month for 24 months. Keep in mind that you'll billed $48 upfront for this two-year plan, and that it renews at $80. Proton VPN Plus has no data caps or server-switching limits. Its ease of use, Tor support and ad-blocking capability also make Proton VPN popular.

PIA VPN: $2 a month for 24 months Devices: UnlimitedRefund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysPrivate Internet Access earned a spot on our list of the best VPN services as one of our favorite budget options. Right now, you can get this VPN for even less. You can get the two-year plan with three extra months for just a little more than $2 a month.Despite its affordable price, PIA's VPN tested fairly well. It offers AES 256-bit encryption, as well as a kill switch function. And it delivers a respectable speed loss of just 24%. You also get 500GB of cloud storage with this deal. It's worth noting that PIA does fall under US jurisdiction, which might be a concern if you're a security-focused user, although the company appears to be doing everything in its power to alleviate those concerns, including making its source code openly available.

Norton VPN: $4 a month for 12 months Devices: Up to 5Return policy: Fully refundable for 60 daysNorton might be a company better known for its antivirus software, but Norton Secure VPN is a solid option for those who want a way to keep their data private while browsing the internet. Right now, you can save solid on its Plus annual plan, which scores you 12 months of service for $50, or a little more than $4 a month. The Norton VPN Standard plan starts at a little more than $3 a month and is billed at $40 upfront, which covers 12 months of service. To get even more protection, the Ultimate plan is $5 a month, billed at $60 for 12 months of service.

IPVanish: $2.19 a month for 24 months Devices: UnlimitedRefund policy: Fully refundable for 30 daysWith one of the best user interfaces in the field, according to our reviewer, IPVanish is good for those who want to customize settings and for those who are new to a VPN. If this is your first time at the rodeo and you want to know more about the technology, IPVanish is a reliable service with a gentle learning curve. Normally, IPVanish goes for about $156 a year, but this deal gets you two years of service for about $53 (a little more than $2 a month). Note that IPVanish is also based in the US, which may be a concern if you're focused on security. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by Ziff Davis, the same parent company as CNET.)

Additional VPN dealsWe haven't fully tested the following VPN. Because of that, we can only recommend it for casual use, such as bypassing geographic restrictions while streaming media.
PureVPN: $2 a month for 60 months Devices: Up to 10Refund policy: Fully refundable for 31 daysPureVPN presents another affordable option if you're in the market for a simple VPN without a big price tag. With a solid server fleet numbering more than 6,500 in 78 countries, PureVPN promises reliable service, although we haven't had the chance to verify that. Another disclaimer: PureVPN was reported by our sister site ZDNET as having provided timestamp-only logs to the FBI in a cyberstalking case in 2018. PureVPN has since stopped the timestamp logging practice and undergone a third-party audit to ensure that it keeps to its no-log policy.It currently has a special offer on a five-year Standard plan, knocking it down to $130, or just $2 a month. That's a super cheap plan for the long term if you're certain PureVPN is the service for you. Two-year plans start at a little more than $2 a month if you're looking for a shorter commitment. Different service tiers offer additional features, like password management and up to 10 logins.

It also comes with a few other services, such as an ad blocker and a masked email generator.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.
How we evaluated these VPN dealsThis list is almost exclusively focused on VPN services that have been tested and reviewed by our team of experts, as you don't want to risk having your personal information leaked just to save a few bucks. Fortunately, almost all of our top-rated VPNs are offering some excellent deals right now. We've analyzed the discounts, subscription length, refund policy, internet speed loss, the maximum number of devices allowed and what each service is best suited for to bring you the best offers available.There are also a few factors you should be aware of when choosing one of these deals:Some of these offers have countdown clocks saying the VPN deals end today. These are usually marketing gimmicks that have no relationship to the deal's actual end date.We'll update sale prices when we notice a change, so check back often.The VPN industry has undergone significant changes in the past few years, with all three of our top VPN choices announcing major shifts in corporate ownership. In 2021, ExpressVPN announced that it had joined Kape Technologies, a company that already owns several other VPNs and has raised privacy concerns in the past.In 2022, NordVPN and Surfshark announced they were merging, although they continue to operate autonomously. We regularly give ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark fresh reviews in light of these changes and continue to evaluate other VPN services as well. Our rankings are subject to change, as they reflect our latest findings.Most of the offers above are for two-year or longer subscriptions, which is a long time to tie yourself to a service that could change ownership or terms of service or even have a security incident. Although most services have a 30-day free cancellation policy, check the terms of service before signing up for a long-term commitment.
VPN deals FAQs
Do I need a VPN?
With online crime rates on the rise, just about anyone can benefit from using a VPN. By creating an encrypted connection between your device and the internet, a VPN prevents your browsing data from being collected by your internet service provider and helps shield your passwords, bank information and other private information.
Are VPNs legal?
Outside of a handful of countries -- such as China, Iran, Oman, Russia, Turkmenistan, UAE and Belarus -- VPNs are perfectly safe and legal to use, so you don't have to worry about ending up in hot water. It's important to note that VPNs are not a "get out of jail free" card, and engaging in illegal activity online is still illegal regardless of whether you're using a VPN.
What about free VPNs?
With the exception of Proton VPN's free tier, we strongly advise against using a free VPN service. For the most part, they're playing that same game of scooping up and selling your data, which could put you at even greater risk than just browsing unprotected. Considering that you can get access to a top-rated VPN for as little as $2 per month, it's certainly not worth the risk.
