You can now preorder a new iPhone, either the base iPhone 17, the new iPhone Air, the 17 Pro or the larger 17 Pro Max. As beautiful as a naked iPhone looks, protecting your new device is essential. Many of your favorite brands, such as Otterbox, Burga, Casetify and more, have already released new cases for the upcoming iPhone 17 models. Apple has dropped a new line of cases, too, with some fun new accessories. We'll continue to update this list as more iPhone 17 cases become available. In the meantime, here are the cases you can currently grab to outfit your new iPhone.

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.Can I use my iPhone 16 case with my iPhone 17?No, sorry. The dimensions of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 do not line up. If you try to use your old case for your iPhone 17, it will not fit. The good news is that there are many new cases you can choose from.  How do I preorder the iPhone 17?You can preorder the iPhone 17 series at select online retailers and carriers. First, decide which model iPhone you want to buy: iPhone Air, iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then, select your preferred color and storage capacity. You also need to decide if you'll trade in an older iPhone, which could get you up to $700 back from Apple.Once you make those decisions, you'll need to choose an optional carrier and AppleCare Plus coverage (or forgo it) and click the blue Add to Bag button. You can then include any accessories you want and enter your payment information to complete your purchase.How do iPhone 17 trade-in offers work?Multiple carriers offer trade-in savings, some valued at up to $1,100 on eligible trade-ins, which could net you a free iPhone 17 Pro. Note, however, that most trade-in deals from carriers require you to become a customer, and the terms often require you to choose some of the priciest plan options.Not a fan of contracts? Some retailers also offer trade-in programs, which could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead. This can be a great way to take advantage of savings without necessarily being locked into a contract. Retail offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers from carriers, though, so keep that in mind as you shop.*All information about the Apple Card has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuer.
