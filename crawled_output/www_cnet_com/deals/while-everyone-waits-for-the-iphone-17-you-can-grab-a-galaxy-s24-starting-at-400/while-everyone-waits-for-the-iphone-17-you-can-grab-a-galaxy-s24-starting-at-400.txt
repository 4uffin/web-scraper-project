Samsung / CNET
See at WootIf you've been holding out for a phone upgrade, now's the moment -- and you don't have to drop iPhone-level cash to get it. Samsung's Galaxy S24 series is on sale at Woot with prices kicking off at $400. But there's a catch. These Galaxy S24 phones come in "like-new" condition, which means they've been gently used. According to Woot, they've been sourced from Samsung's 15-day return program and thoroughly inspected to ensure quality. They won't come in the original retail box, but you'll still get a USB-C cable and SIM-ejector tool. The sale only runs through next Monday, Sept. 22, or until stock runs dry. Given that these are 2024 flagships, they might sell out quick, so get your order in soon if you're interested.Samsung Galaxy S24 Series from $400
See at Woot
The sale has already sold out of the base S24, but you can grab the S24 Plus from $400 and S24 Ultra from $550, with more options for higher storage. Whether you're after big-screen daily use or Samsung's powerhouse Ultra with its advanced cameras, this is a rare chance to pick up a premium device without the premium price tag. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.Spec-wise, the S24 Plus features a high-refresh-rate 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED 2X display and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. The S24 Ultra takes things further with a 6.8-inch display, titanium frame, improved cooling and a camera setup led by a 200-megapixel main sensor plus telephoto and ultrawide lenses. Battery capacity is at nearly 5,000 mAh on the S24 Plus and Ultra, too, and these models support both wired and wireless charging.If these aren't to your taste, take a look at our picks for the best Android smartphones for 2025. You're sure to find something there. And for other discounted options, peruse our roundup of all the best phone deals happening now.See at Woot

Apple iPhone 14 128GB Unlocked Phone (Refurbished, Midnight):  $334 (save $295) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.Why this deal mattersBecause phones are expensive, having an option that's nearly brand new but costs hundreds less makes a real difference. Opting for an older model is a great way to save some cash on an upgrade. You're still getting much of what people chase when they buy top-tier devices without paying the full price.
