Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Nintendo has recently increased its prices for the original Switch console. The Switch 2 has dodged that fate so far but the company has said that "price adjustments may be necessary in the future." No one wants to pay more for the console and with preorders for the new Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundle available right now, we suggest picking it up sooner rather than later.
See at AmazonWe're also keeping track of the accessories you'll want for your new console, from screen protectors to cameras.
This story is part of
Nintendo Switch 2, a collection of all things related to Nintendo's next-gen game console.

When can I order the Nintendo Switch 2?It was a little tough to get your hands on the Switch 2 for a few weeks after its release in June but things have calmed down since then. Nintendo and retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart have the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle available. Stocks fluctuate and the console will occasionally sell out at one retailer or another but you can almost always find one available either online or in person. Read more: How Nintendo Is Combating Switch 2 ScalpersHow much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?The standalone console costs $450 and the Mario Kart World bundle is $500. It doesn't look like that will be changing any time soon but Nintendo recently increased its prices for the original Switch console, as well as a handful of games and accessories. The Switch 2 console has not been affected so far, but the company said that "price adjustments may be necessary in the future."Will the Nintendo Switch 2 come in other colors?For the new Switch 2, Nintendo has ditched the colored Joy-Cons for a more sleek, monochrome look -- although there are still pops of red and blue around the analog sticks. As of now, Nintendo hasn't said anything about additional colors. Additionally, it's rumored that Samsung -- which makes the displays for the Switch 2 -- is pushing for an OLED version of the console.Is the Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World Bundle worth it?The Mario Kart series has been a long-standing tentpole for Nintendo and fans were thrilled to hear that a new title would be accompanying the new console. But the excitement was dampened by the announcement that the new game will come with an increased price tag: $80 for the digital edition or $90 if you want a physical copy. However, you can bundle a digital copy with the console for $500 total, which saves you $30 compared with buying them separately. It's an excellent value if it's a game you're certain you want in your library and likely the only "discount" we'll see on this title for quite some time. Plus, Nintendo recently announced that this bundle will be available only "through fall 2025," which means you'll have a limited chance to take advantage of these savings.
Nintendo Switch 2: What are people saying?There are still some mixed feelings about Nintendo's newest console. While some are happy to see that Nintendo hasn't altered much about the wildly popular original Switch, others feel not enough has changed to justify the $150 price hike -- with CNET gaming expert Scott Stein calling it a console that "feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own." The confirmation that the US tariffs won't be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers' exasperation a bit but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We're eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they're finally getting their hands on the new console and games.
