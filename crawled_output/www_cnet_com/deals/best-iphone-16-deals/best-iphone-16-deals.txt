The new iPhone 17 series officially went on sale last week, which means that the iPhone 16 series is now a generation old. But even though they're no longer the latest models in Apple's lineup, they still have plenty to offer and are excellent for Apple users looking for a more budget-friendly alternative. Plus, they're even better now that you can grab one at a massive discount. Major carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are offering some serious bargains to help make room for the new generation, which means you can save hundreds (or even more) with a new line or trade-in right now. To help you make the most of these offers, CNET's shopping experts have rounded up all of the best iPhone 16 deals below. Though it's worth noting that offers will start to dwindle as the iPhone 17 series moves into the spotlight, so take advantage of these deals soon.Read more: iPhone 16E vs. iPhone 16: Here Are All the Specs ComparedAnd if you're looking to switch to an Android phone, there are plenty of Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 10 deals available, too.

When did the iPhone 16 launch?Apple's iPhone 16 and 16 Pro lineup hit stores in September 2024, while the iPhone 16E was released in February. You can now pop into any retailer that sells the iPhone -- like an Apple store, Best Buy or your mobile provider -- and buy from their remaining stock.Use the Apple Store app to select the model, storage and color you like and check availability at your nearest physical Apple store. You'll also find the lineup at all major carriers, and we've highlighted those offers below.Read more: A Billion Pixels a Second: A Rare Look Inside Apple's Secret iPhone Camera LabsHow do I order the iPhone 16?You can shop for the iPhone 16 series on nearly all online retailers and carriers, as well as at brick-and-mortar locations.First, decide which model iPhone you want to buy: iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max or iPhone 16E. Then, select your preferred color and storage capacity and decide if you'll trade in an older iPhone, which could get you up to $700 back from Apple.Then, choose an optional carrier and AppleCare Plus coverage (or not) and click the blue Add to Bag button. You can then include any accessories you want and enter your payment information to complete your purchase.How much does the iPhone 16 cost and what are the specs?Prices differ depending on the amount of storage you buy, but here's the range:iPhone 16E: $599 to $899iPhone 16: $799 to $1,099iPhone 16 Plus: $899 to $1,199iPhone 16 Pro: $999 to $1,499iPhone 16 Pro Max: $1,199 to $1,599iPhone 16 lineup specs

One important thing to keep in mind is that most trade-in deals from carriers require you to become a customer and they often apply to the priciest plan options.Select retailers with trade-in programs could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead, so you don't necessarily have to be locked into a contract to take advantage of the savings you can get from parting with your old device. However, those offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers.
