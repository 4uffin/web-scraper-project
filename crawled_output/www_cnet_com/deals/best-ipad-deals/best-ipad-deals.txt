iPad deals FAQ
When are the best iPad deals available?
Discounts on Apple tablets pop up throughout the year, but they're typically shortlived. If you're looking for more consistent savings, you'll want to wait for a major shopping event. The best bargains normally happen during Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Amazon Prime Day.
Which retailers offer the best iPad deals?
Apple rarely offers discounts on its devices, so you'll have to look elsewhere if you're hoping to pick up an iPad on sale. Major retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are good places to start, especially during major shopping events. It's also worth seeing what deals are available at smaller online retailers like Adorama, B&H Photo and Newegg, as they may be offering some under-the-radar bargains that aren't being matched at larger competitors.
What is the difference between iPads?
Apple makes four versions of the iPad, which vary in price, display quality and chip performance. All of them feature iPadOS similarly, and all the current-gen models charge via USB-C. The entry-level flagship iPad is affordable and versatile but lacks the powerful M-series chips found on the Air and Pro models, which are faster and support a few pro-level Apple apps. The latest Pro iPads also feature step-up OLED displays with better brightness, contrast and refresh rates, and they are a bit thinner and lighter. It's also worth noting that different iPads are compatible with different versions of the Apple Pencil stylus.
