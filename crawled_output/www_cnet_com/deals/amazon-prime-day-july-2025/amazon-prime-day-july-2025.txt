Usually, the sale only lasts two days, so this is a significant expansion compared to previous years. However, the amount you save could be affected by tariffs. Regardless, we expect to see tons of price cuts on the latest tech, smart home upgrades and everyday basics. Additionally, you can start adding deals to your cart now.Previous Amazon Prime Day datesSince Amazon launched its first Prime Day sale in 2015, the company has scheduled the event for around the same time of year. Outside of a couple of recent years, Amazon has traditionally kicked off its main sale event around the middle two weeks of July and 2025 is no exception. Here are the previous Amazon Prime Day dates:Prime Day 2015: July 15Prime Day 2016: July 12Prime Day 2017: July 11 to 12Prime Day 2018: July 16 to 17Prime Day 2019: July 15 to 16Prime Day 2020: Oct. 13 to 14Prime Day 2021: June 21 to 22Prime Day 2022: July 12 to 13Prime Early Access Sale 2022: Oct. 11 to 12Prime Day 2023: July 11 to 12Prime Big Deal Days 2023: Oct. 10 to 11Prime Day 2024: July 16 to 17Prime Big Deal Days 2024: Oct. 8 to 9Big Spring Sale 2025: March 20 to 25Prime Day 2025: July 8 to 11Should you shop on Prime Day if you didn't get a chance to shop this July 4th?There's no doubt that there will be tons of deals during both events. However, it's not about when to shop but what to shop for. Fourth of July sales tend to bring more outdoor deals, and there are still a few lingering deals that might extend to Prime Day. But if you're looking for electronics or smart home gadgets, you'll have better luck during Prime Day. And if you don't have anything specific in mind, enjoy shopping all these deals for just about half the month of July. Will tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?Tariffs are top of mind for most Americans and it could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs are currently paused but only until July 9, right when Prime Day begins. What is Prime Day?Amazon began the annual Prime Day tradition in 2015. And ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale.We know Prime Day is a short two days away but we're covering all the essentials ahead of time, including everything from signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.
