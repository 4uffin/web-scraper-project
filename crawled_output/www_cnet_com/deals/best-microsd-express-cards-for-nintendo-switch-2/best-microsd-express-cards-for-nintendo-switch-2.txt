The Nintendo Switch 2 is officially here, and it's living up to the hype. Nintendo's
gave us a good idea of what to expect, and we've been playing Mario Kart World just like everyone else. While the console looks similar to the previous one, it's very different in some key ways. That's why you should definitely check out our explainer on everything you need to know about the Switch 2 whether you're a proud owner or waiting for restocks.One of the most notable changes, compared to the OG Switch, is that the console will only work with microSD Express cards. That means you're going to need one if the Switch 2's 256GB of internal storage isn't enough for your needs. Switch 2 games are bigger than you might be used to, and we expect future titles to take up even more space.Your old microSD probably won't work if you just swap it in. To fully be able to enjoy a brand new Switch 2, you'll need to buy a microSD Express. Don't worry about looking around for them, though. We've got it covered. Best MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2
PNY microSD Express (256GB) PNY has just entered the arena with a new line of cards that are built just for Nintendo Switch 2. The stats here look pretty good, and we're looking forward to testing them.

Sandisk microSD Express (128GB) The Switch 2 comes with 256GB of internal memory, so it may not seem worthwhile to add only 128GB of external storage, but some is better than none. MicroSD Express is significantly more expensive than a standard microSD, and the best option is always the option you can afford.

Sandisk microSD Express (256GB) This is likely going to be the most popular choice for storage on the Switch 2. It doubles the usable storage of your console, and at $60 it isn't an outrageous price either. If you're a hardcore gamer and you think you'll have dozens of games loaded onto your Switch 2, then you may want to go bigger, but I think for the average person, a combined storage of 512GB should be plenty.

But as they become more popular, we're likely to see more places stocking them, and potentially a drop in price too.Likewise, with tariffs up in the air, it's hard to know if storage cards like these will shoot up in price instead, so if it's in your budget and you're sure you're buying a Switch 2, it may be best to get your card now. We've found some third-party Switch 2 accessories you can shop now, too.

Switch 2 microSD Express card FAQ
Do I need a microSD Express card for the Switch 2?
You don't need one to play the Switch 2. The console already comes with 256GB of internal storage, so if you can keep your gaming needs under that threshold, you won't have to buy a microSD Express card. That said, some third-party games we see could be much larger than the standard Nintendo games. Elden Ring alone is 45GB, almost a fifth of your internal storage.
What is a microSD Express card and why does the Switch 2 need it?
MicroSD Express cards are significantly faster than standard microSD cards. For instance, the SanDisk Extreme 256GB card has a read speed of 190Mb/s but the 256GB Express has a read speed of up to 880Mb/s. That's a massive difference when you're a console trying to move game data around.
Can I use my old microSD card for the Switch 2?
The answer is likely no, unless you already have a microSD card Express card. Standard microSD cards won't be compatible with the Switch 2, largely due to transfer speeds.
What's the maximum capacity of a Switch 2 microSD card?
The maximum capacity of the Switch 2 microSD Express is 2TB. There aren't many of them around, and they're very expensive, but the Switch 2 can read them successfully.
What's a good price for a microSD Express card?
These Express cards are fairly new technology and because of that, they're considerably more expensive than the standard versions. An older 256GB microSD is around $25 on Amazon, whereas the SanDisk 256GB Express is $60. They are much faster, though. Over twice the price for almost four times the speed seems a fair trade.
