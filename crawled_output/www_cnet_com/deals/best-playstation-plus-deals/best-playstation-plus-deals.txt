Sony
PlayStation Plus is a good way to get more value out of your
PlayStation 5. It not only offers free games every month, but also uspecial discounts digitally, and depending on your tier, can also offer a massive library of games as well. However, it's important to note that there are three membership tiers. To help you find the one that's best for you, Max McHone -- an avid PlayStation player and one of CNET's dedicated deals writers -- has broken down the features and prices of each tier below.
Watch this: PlayStation Plus: Picking the Best Tier
10:39
What is the best deal right now?The best deal right now is on PlayStation Plus via PlayStation. Opting for a 12-month subscription saves you up to 33% compared to paying monthly. The discounted amount is based on which tier you choose, so keep that in mind.The best PlayStation Plus deal
Sony
PS Plus 12 Months: Up To 33% Off
Save up to $109 versus paying monthly
See at PlayStation
You can find a discount on all tiers of PS Plus at the moment.The basic Essentials plan is currently down to $80 for a year, which is $40 cheaper than paying monthly. The Extra tier is down to $135 for a year, which is $45 off versus paying monthly, which is nice. Then you've got the Premium tier, which is down to just $160 for a year, making it a decent $56 off versus paying monthly. That's a massive amount of money off.
See at PlayStation
PlayStation Plus membership packagesOriginally, Sony offered two gaming subscriptions, PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now. But since 2023, both subscriptions have been rolled into a single service with multiple tiers. So three membership packages are available: PlayStation Essential, Extra and Premium. To help you choose, we've broken down the prices and what's included for each tier below.PS Plus EssentialAt $10 a month, $25 for three months or $80 for a year, PlayStation Plus Essential isn't very different than the previously offered PS Plus subscription. It offers all of the same features, including access to online play, two monthly games for free, cloud storage and exclusive discounts at the PlayStation Store. And if you had a PS Plus membership before the revamp, it was automatically converted to an Essential membership.PS Plus ExtraAt $15 a month, $40 for three months or $135 for a year, a midtier PlayStation Plus Extra subscription is somewhat similar to the Game Pass Ultimate membership offered to Xbox users. It includes all the benefits and features of an Essential membership but also provides access to a catalog of up to 400 PS4 and PS5 games. The selection includes plenty of hit titles like Ghost of Tsushima and Red Dead Redemption 2.PS Plus PremiumA PlayStation Plus Premium membership is the highest tier available, and it costs $18 a month, $50 for three months or $160 for a full year. In addition to the benefits of Essential and Extra subscriptions, it offers access to a massive library of more than 700 games. That includes the recent PS4 and PS5 hits from the Extra subscription, but also a catalog of more than 300 classics from the PS1, PS2 and PS3 eras (similar to the previous PS Now subscription). It allows you to stream many of these classic titles, so you don't have to worry about them eating up valuable storage space.You also get access to time-limited game trials, so you can test new games before you commit to buying them. If you had a subscription to PS Now before the revamp went live, it was automatically converted to a PlayStation Plus Premium membership.How we choose PlayStation Plus deals at CNETSavings on PlayStation gaming subscriptions can be pretty tough to come by. So to help you get signed up for less, we scout the best deals being offered by Sony directly, as well as trusted third-party retailers like CDKeys. We evaluate the membership tier, subscription length and discount to help you get the best monthly price on the plan that works best for you. Join Our Daily Deals Text Group!

PlayStation Plus deals FAQ
Which PlayStation Plus tier is the best value?
At $15 a month, $40 for three months or $135 for a year, a midtier PlayStation Plus Extra subscription will give you the most bang for your buck. At this tier, you get access to a massive library of over 400 free games, including plenty of popular games like Red Dead Redemption 2, which makes it easy to get your money's worth. Unless you're a big fan of retro games, then it's probably not worth upgrading to the Premium tier.
When are the best PS Plus deals usually available?
The best (and pretty much only) way to save on a PS Plus subscription is to take advantage of the direct discounts from Sony, but these typically only happen a few times a year. They usually fall during major shopping events like Black Friday in November and holiday sales in December and January, as well as Sony's Days of Play sale in early summer. Also note that some of the deals are exclusive to new subscribers.
Is a PlayStation Plus subscription required?
A Plus subscription is not a requirement for PlayStation gamers, and there are hundreds of titles you can play without one. However, you will need a membership if you want to participate in online multiplayer. Access to online play is included in all tiers, starting at $10 a month for an Essential membership.
Are longer subscriptions a better value?
For the best bargain available, you'll want to sign up for an annual subscription. Opting for a 12-month membership saves you 33% on the Essential and Extra tiers and 25% on the Premium tier compared to paying monthly. Just note that once you sign up for a one-year subscription, you'll have only 14 days to cancel and get a refund.
