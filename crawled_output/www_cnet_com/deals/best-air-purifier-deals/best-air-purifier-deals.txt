Air purifier deal FAQs
How often should I change the filter on an air purifier?
There are quite a few factors that affect how often you should be changing your filter, including how polluted your air is and how often you're running the purifier. As a general rule, roughly every six months is what most brands recommend. However, many air purifiers also have a prefilter that traps larger particles like pet hair, which should be changed or cleaned more frequently to ensure optimal efficiency.
What is a HEPA filter?
If you've been shopping around for a new air purifier, you've probably seen the term "HEPA filter" a lot. HEPA stands for "high efficiency particulate air" and refers to a filter standardized by the US Department of Energy for filtering a specific size of particulate matter out of the air. These particulates can include dust, bacteria, viruses, pollen, smoke and mold, and in the US, HEPA filters are required to remove at least 99.7% of particles down to 0.3 microns in size out of the air. If you're looking for more info, Coway has an excellent breakdown on its website.
Where is the best place to put an air purifier?
For maximum efficiency, you'll want to keep your air purifier as close to the center of the room as possible. However, it will still function fine if you keep it somewhere a little less obtrusive, as long as you make sure the input and output vents aren't blocked. It's also beneficial to keep it near doorways and vents with airflow if possible.
