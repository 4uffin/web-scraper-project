4K TV deals FAQ
What size TV should you get?
There are a few factors you'll want to consider when shopping for a new TV, including room size and viewing distance, but in general, we've found that a 65- or 75-inch screen is the sweet spot for most living rooms. They're large enough to see clearly from most viewing angles, without being so large that they overwhelm the space.
What should you look for in a 4K TV?
Size isn't the only factor you'll want to consider when shopping for a new TV. Since most new TVs are smart these days, you'll also want to consider which platform a 4K TV runs on, such as Amazon's Fire OS, Google TV or Roku, as well as any smart home integrations you'll want to make the most of, like Alexa, Google Assistant or Apple's HomeKit and AirPlay tech. If you're an avid gamer, you'll also want to make sure that your TV has a suitable number of HDMI ports.
When are the best 4K TV deals available?
Like most consumer electronics, the best 4K TV deals will be found around major sales events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday. These events offer some of the best prices of the year and see multiple retailers competing for shoppers' cash, which is good news for your wallet. Memorial Day and Labor Day often bring big discounts as well. We keep tabs on TV pricing throughout the year, and any surprise, out-of-season sales will be listed above.
Which retailers usually offer the best 4K TV deals?
When you think of nabbing a 4K TV deal, you should start at big-box retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. These stores tend to offer some of the biggest sales on 4K TVs, both in-store and online, with online-only retailers like Amazon often matching prices, especially during the fall sale season.
