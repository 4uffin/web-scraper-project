Apple's AirPods have been getting quite a lot of attention since the company announced the new AirPods Pro 3 last week. You can grab a pair starting this Friday, but it will be quite a while before we see any discounts. However, the announcement has stirred up quite a few deals on other pairs, including the latest flagship AirPods 4, previous-gen AirPods Pro 2 and the premium over-ear AirPods Max.To help you make the most of these savings, we've rounded up all the best AirPods deals available below, as well as deals on more affordable Beats headphones that incorporate Apple tech. We'll continue to update this list as offers come and go, so be sure to check back often for the best prices.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. Best AirPods deals

AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C): $199 The second-gen AirPods Pro are among the best noise-canceling earbuds on the market and are a top pick for Apple users. This updated version includes the USB-C and MagSafe charging case. They are almost identical to the original AirPods Pro 2, except for one key feature. Folks who buy a Vision Pro headset will benefit from lossless audio when connecting these earbuds. That's probably a small detail, but it's still worth considering, especially if Apple adds the same feature to future iPhones and other hardware.Our in-depth review by resident audio expert David Carnoy noted that the AirPods Pro 2 feel like a "fully evolved, refined product that packs not only an impressive set of features but top-notch performance in a very small design." These are even better value for the money when on sale.

AirPods 4: $116 Amazon is currently offering $13 off the latest AirPods 4, which drops them to just $116. Our AirPods 4 review noted that the new design is a better fit for a wider range of ears, which is an advantage over the last generation. Our reviewer also noted that the AirPods 4 "may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2 but they sound a lot better and have a lot more features."

AirPods 4 with ANC: $169 Apple's latest AirPods 4 with ANC are now $10 off, which makes this a great time to purchase if you want to avoid paying full price. With active noise cancellation, they're perfect for focusing at work, during travel or other important tasks. The powerful H2 chip makes it easy to toggle ANC with transparency mode whenever you need to remain alert. With a battery life of up to 4 hours on a single charge and an extra 20 hours when you take your case, these earbuds are perfect for long travel plans and can tackle work meetings.Our audio reviewer and expert, David Carnoy, gave these earbuds a glowing review, saying that the "noise canceling really is a game-changer," noting that they have most of what you expect from the AirPods Pro 2 in an open earbud design. He also said that "they're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works." If that is a combination you need, look no further.

Although these have been out for nearly five years now, with the USB-C refresh launched less than a year ago, the AirPods Max still land near the top of the best headphones we've tested. In our AirPods Max review, we noted that "if you're looking for a high-end experience, the AirPods Max deliver one."

Beats Solo 4: $130 If you find over-ear headphones to be a little bulky, the Beats Solo 4s are an excellent alternative.

They lack active noise cancellation but support spatial audio if you're an Apple user. Plus, they deliver an impressive 50 hours of listening time per charge. They're also lightweight at just 217 grams and the plush ear cushions help reduce outside noise.

AirPods deals FAQs
When is the best time to find AirPods deals?
Deals on Apple headphones pop up sporadically throughout the year, sometimes only lasting for a day or even a few hours. However, the best deals are consistently found during major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Amazon Prime Day.
Which AirPods are right for you?
Apple's wireless audio lineup includes five AirPod models, and choosing the right set will depend on the features you care about and the price you are willing to pay. If you prefer an open-ear design, you can grab yourself a pair of AirPods 4. The third-gen AirPods are also still available, but considering that they're pricier than the latest generation, they're not really worth considering unless you can find them at a major discount.If you prefer noise-canceling capabilities, your options are the in-ear AirPods Pro 3, the over-ear AirPods Max or the upgraded version of the AirPods 4. The AirPods Pro 3 and both versions of the AirPods 4 have Apple's latest H2 chip, which supports lossless audio, something that the pricey AirPods Max are surprisingly lacking. Plus, all the AirPods listed above are compatible with Apple's spatial audio features.
Does spatial audio sound different on different AirPods?
The short answer is, not really when you're talking about spatial audio with head tracking for movie and TV watching. While the AirPods Max offers the best sound overall, using the spatial audio virtual sound feature is largely the same experience on all the AirPods that support it.
Are AirPods good for working out?
While some models are certainly better than others, the second-gen AirPods Pro have claimed a top spot on our list of the best workout headphones, thanks to their lightweight design, top-notch noise-cancelation and IP54 weather-resistance rating.
