Greenworks 40-volt cordless lawn mower (16-inch): $220 This cordless Greenworks lawn mower has a 16-inch-wide cutting path, only weighs 38 pounds and has a folding handle, so it'll be easy to maneuver and store. Small to medium yards and even smaller storage spaces are ideal for this model. Its removable 40V battery will run for up to 35 minutes of continuous mowing, to get every bit of the yard in one go. Other notable features include a push-button start, five-position height adjustment and rear bagging and mulching.

Eufy E18 Robot Lawn Mower: $1,700 The E18 is a standalone robot lawn mower that can easily cut 0.3 acres of grass. It uses a 3D perception system to map obstacles around your yard without the need for Real-Time Kinetic (RTK) beacons. The beacons help improve accuracy, but can increase the price of the mower. Because the E18 doesn't use RTK beacons, you'll need a physical barrier to keep it from wandering off.

Electric Lawn Mower Deals FAQ
When is the best time to buy an electric lawn mower?
Generally, the best times to find a good bargain on an electric lawn mower are spring, late summer and early fall, as many retailers and manufacturers offer seasonal deals right before and after the peak lawn-care season in June and July.
Who is an electric lawn mower suitable for?
There are various electric mower pros and cons, so you'll want to assess your needs before ditching gas for batteries. The biggest downside to battery-powered electric mowers is usually the power. Gas mowers have more power for tackling hilly terrain or larger yards where an electric mower's torque and battery life may let you down. The average household could get along just fine with an electric mower, and easy-to-replace rechargeable batteries can be used to extend the range affordably. Electric mowers are also preferable for those who want a quieter operation or need easier maneuverability since they're usually lighter than their gas-powered counterparts, not to mention the environmental benefits.
Which retailers have the best electric lawn mower deals?
You'll find sporadic offers at major retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy, but there's typically a limited selection available. Hardware stores like Lowes, Home Depot and Ace don't offer discounts quite as frequently but have a much wider variety of models to choose from. Some manufacturers, like Greenworks, also offer direct deals and discounts occasionally.
