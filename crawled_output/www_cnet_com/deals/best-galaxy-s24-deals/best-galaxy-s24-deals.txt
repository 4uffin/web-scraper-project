If you'd like to get your hands on one for less than full price, we've gathered the best deals below. If you're interested in snagging this previous-generation Galaxy phone, now's the time. Stock is limited, but a handful of carriers are offering substantial savings -- especially if you have an old phone to trade in. To help you take advantage of these bargains, we've brought some of the best Galaxy S24 deals to the same place so you can find the right offer for your needs and budget. We'll continue to update this page as deals come and go, so check back often.

Plus, these phones were among the first to include generative AI.That means you can use gen AI services anywhere, even when the device is offline. The phones are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, so performance for on-device AI should be fast and dependable.Read more: Best Samsung Phones of 2025

Galaxy S24 deals FAQs
How much does the Galaxy S24 cost?
The three models of the Galaxy S24 are available in various storage configurations. Samsung has lowered its prices since it announced the S25 series, but here is the original US pricing for each model was as follows:Samsung Galaxy S24 price: $800Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus price: $1,000Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra price: $1,300In terms of configuration upgrades, the S24 remains the same as its predecessor with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The S24 Plus has 12GB of RAM, which is up from 8GB in the S23 Plus, and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. The Ultra also sports an upgraded 12GB of RAM and is available with 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage.
What colors does the Galaxy S24 come in?
The Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus come in yellow, violet, gray and black at retailers. If you order directly from Samsung, you will also be able to order green, blue and orange hues.
What is the cheapest Galaxy S24 deal?
If you're buying a phone from the S24 series in new condition, the base S24 model will be the cheapest phone available. The unlocked model starts at $700, and you can find carriers offering Galaxy S24 deals from as little as $0 a month, which scores you the phone for free or at an affordable price.
When is the best time to snag a Galaxy S24 deal?
Phone deals happen throughout the year, but there are some standout times when it makes the most sense to buy a Galaxy phone. Perhaps the best chance to score a top deal is when a new model launches. The Galaxy S24 series arrived in January 2024, while the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6 arrived in July of last year. If you're an early adopter and if you generally like to purchase the latest model as it arrives, you'll find excellent preorder deals that often involve free storage upgrades and big trade-in savings. It's also a great time to buy if you're looking for an exceptional deal on a previous-gen model, as prices on older models tend to drop as the new devices hit shelves. Other times of year that make the most sense are during major sale seasons, including annual events like Memorial Day sales, Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day. Samsung doesn't always participate in these events, but plenty of third-party retailers and carriers will be offering some of their best Galaxy S24 deals during these shopping events.
Which Galaxy S24 model should I buy?
This answer depends on your needs and budget. The S24, S24 Plus and S24 Ultra all have their merits, but as a general rule of thumb, you're likely to pay the least amount for the base S24 model at both retailers and carriers. This is especially true if you also have a phone to trade in for credit toward an upgrade.For those looking for the latest and greatest with the most powerful specs and features, you'll want to look for offers on the S24 Ultra, which is the top-of-the-line model in Samsung's current flagship series. Taking advantage of deals can make it more affordable to get your hands on one.
