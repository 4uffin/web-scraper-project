T-Mobile/CNET
Plans at major carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are the most popular but also the most expensive. Luckily, deals always seem to be available. This includes free additional lines, bundle offers and more. But one thing we rarely see is a single-line discount. That's why smaller carriers are a great way to save some cash each month if you need just one line. And right now, Metro by T-Mobile has an incredible offer for those on a tight budget who are switching providers.
See at Metro by T-MobileIf you bring your own device to Metro, you can get a single line of unlimited 5G data for just $25 a month. Customers can get a new number or keep their old phone number when signing up online. If you choose to sign up in-store, customers will have to port their existing number.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.This deal includes a five-year price guarantee, so you don't have to worry about any surprises on your bill after a couple of months. Note that this price requires enrollment in autopay, and you'll pay $30 for the first month. Metro also operates on the same network as T-Mobile, so you're getting the same reliable coverage for a fraction of the usual cost.
This plan also comes with some extra benefits, including Scam Shield, which helps protect you from phishing calls and texts. You'll also get unlimited talk and text and access to special deals on food, gas, entertainment and more on "T-Mobile Tuesdays."
Top deals available today, according to CNET's shopping experts
Curated discounts worth shopping while they last.
Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C): $169 (save $80)Powrun P-One portable jump starter: $60 (save $40)Dreame X40 Ultra robot vacuum and mop: $740 (save $660)Costco 1-year Gold Star membership plus $20 gift card: $65 (save $20)Anker 5-in-1 power strip: $40 (save $30)
Why this deal matters
Cell plans typically get more affordable when you have multiple lines, which means it can get pretty pricey if you only need one. This Metro by T-Mobile offer is a rare chance to get a single line at a great price on a plan that includes unlimited calls, texts and 5G data. Plus, the $25 per month price is guaranteed for five years.
