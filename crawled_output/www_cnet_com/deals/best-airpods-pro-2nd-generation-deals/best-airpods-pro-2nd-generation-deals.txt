AirPods Pro 2 deals FAQ
Do the AirPods Pro 2 have noise-canceling capabilities?
Powered by Apple's H2 chip, the second-gen AirPods Pro delivers some of the best noise-canceling capabilities out there at the moment. They've even secured a top spot on our list of the overall best noise-canceling headphones. They support Adaptive Audio, which automatically adjusts the level of noise canceling to suit your environment, and they have a transparency mode for when you need to be more aware of your surroundings.
Are the AirPods Pro 2 good for working out?
Thanks to their lightweight design and IP54 dust- and sweat-resistance, the second-gen AirPods Pro have earned a spot on our list of the best headphones for working out. They are not completely waterproof so they can't be used in the rain or other extreme conditions.
What is the battery life of the AirPods Pro 2?
The earbuds themselves have a battery life of up to six hours with noise canceling active, and the charging case supports up to 30 hours of listening time per charge. *All information about the Target Circle™Card, B&H Payboo card and Apple Card has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuers.
