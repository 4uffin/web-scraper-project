Amazon began its annual Prime Day sale in 2015. Ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale.
Prime Day has wrapped up, but we've still got you covered when it comes to all things Amazon, including what to know about signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.
Will tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?
Tariffs are top of mind for most Americans and they could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs are currently paused but only until July, right when Prime Day begins.
How to keep up with the best Prime Day sales
There are a lot of ways to ensure you're getting the latest scoop on Prime Day offers. The CNET Deals team covers all the best price drops, discounts and deals every day from across the web, highlighting the best offers. We'll be tracking all the major retailer sales around Prime Day and sharing the promotions you need to hear about and there are plenty of ways to hear from us.
One option is to bookmark CNET.com/deals to check out our latest coverage. You can also follow @CNETDeals on X to see everything we publish or sign up for our CNET Deals newsletter for a daily digest of deals delivered to your inbox. Another great option is to sign up for CNET Deals text alerts for curated deals during major shopping events. Remember to install our CNET Shopping browser extension to help ensure that purchases you make all year round will be at the lowest price.
