What is the best phone plan deal right now?There are many excellent bargains on phone plans available right now but with so many variables it's difficult to recommend any of them as a single standout offer. However, we can recommend considering crucial factors when choosing a deal -- including the number of lines you'll need, how much data you typically use and whether you're OK with being locked into a multiyear contract. If you're looking for guidance, be sure to check out our roundup of the overall best phone plans to help you decide which plan and carrier are best suited for your needs. How we choose phone plan deals at CNETCNET's dedicated deals writers have years of experience helping readers make the most of their budgets, which includes plenty of coverage of discounted services and subscriptions. One of the most important things we've learned is that the prices and discounts being advertised are rarely the same deal you get. To help you avoid the headache of sifting through page after page of fine print, we've ensured that the deals featured on this list are legitimate and have included detailed breakdowns of how the pricing for each offer works. These included prepaid and contract offers from major carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, as well as trusted budget-friendly carriers that piggyback on the major networks.
Phone plan deals FAQs
Which phone plan is the best value?
Ultimately, the answer will depend on your individual needs and priorities. We prefer T-Mobile's Essential Saver plan for those who only need a single line, while Google Fi's Simply Unlimited plan is our favorite for families. You'll find tons of information to help you pick the right one in our breakdown of the overall best phone plans.
What is the difference between a prepaid plan and a contract?
Prepaid phone plans allow you to choose the length of service that you'd like (typically in three-, six- and 12-month increments) and only pay for those months of coverage upfront. On the other hand, a contract will lock you into a plan and carrier for two or three years. Prepaid plans allow for more flexibility but also tend to be more expensive, while contract plans are usually more affordable and come with free bonuses but are more restrictive.
Can I keep my old phone and number if I switch carriers?
Not only will most major carriers allow you to keep the same device and phone number, but many even offer special discounts when you switch from one of their competitors. Sometimes your new carrier will even pay the fee to buy you out of your old contract. This is not a guarantee, and you should always check the terms and conditions of your new and old contracts to make sure you won't be on the hook for any remaining payments.
