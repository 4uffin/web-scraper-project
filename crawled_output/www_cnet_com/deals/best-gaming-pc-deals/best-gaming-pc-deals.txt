Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
CNET
The competition between platforms only continues to intensify, with PCs comfortably pulling ahead in power, customization and access to next-gen technology, such as VR. A gaming PC will push the latest and greatest titles to their absolute limits, but this experience comes at a cost. If you've been thinking about upgrading, we have good news -- some of the top models on the market are heavily discounted right now. With Memorial Day creeping up fast, many retailers are cutting prices across the board, and we have shortlisted the best deals.Finding the right machine can be a challenge with the numerous brands, the constant fluctuation of prices and the various specs and builds. To make things easier, we break it all down here so you can play the biggest releases of 2025 -- like Assassin's Creed, Doom, Avowed, Death Stranding 2 and Monster Hunter Wilds -- as well as the best releases of the past few years. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  We regularly update this list since new deals pop up daily and old ones expire just as quickly -- meaning you have to be fast if you don't want to miss out. It's also worth noting that we sometimes include PCs that aren't on sale because they offer great value, even at their regular prices. With all that in mind, scroll on for the latest deals and best gaming PCs for 2025 and beyond.
Skytech Archangel with RTX 4060: $900 If you fancy something a bit different with a splash of color, this Skytech Archangel is the way to go -- especially now that it's $900. It has an RTX 4060, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 OS, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB RAM and a white limited-edition mesh case.

Yeyian Tanto with RTX 4060: $850 The Yeyian Tanto is a great starter gaming PC with generous specs for price. It includes a solid RTX 4060 graphics card that'll work with all the latest games. You also get a 1TB SSD, 16GB of DDR5 memory and a decent Intel Core i5 processor. The memory might need upgrading (which is inexpensive), but it'll probably be enough for a couple of years before that.

How to choose a good gaming PC dealThere are thousands of gaming PC deals to choose from, but not all of them are worth your hard-earned cash. As with any pricey purchase, it's worth assessing your needs before diving in and spending big bucks. When it comes to gaming PC deals, that means looking at how demanding the games you plan on playing are, how your new PC will fit into your existing setup (how many displays it will be driving, for example, and at what resolution and frame rate) and your budget. If you want multi-monitor 4K gaming, you'll probably struggle with a budget of $1,000, so it's best to be realistic with your expectations. Once you've considered those factors, it all comes down to the price-to-performance ratio on offer. The main considerations here are the processor, graphics card and RAM, as these will have the most impact on your overall experience. Newer and more powerful parts will increase the overall price -- just take a look at our list of the best graphics cards for gamers and you'll see that these don't come cheap -- so consider machines with recent previous-gen components to save some cash.Should I buy a prebuilt gaming PC deal or build my own? Depending on how technically savvy you are, the proposition of building your own gaming PC will either excite or scare you. The main benefit of building a PC is that you get to choose every component, shop around for deals on individual parts, and ultimately get more bang for your buck. The downside is that it takes a lot of research, effort and a decent amount of technical savvy. There's also the risk of something going wrong in the build process, which means you'll end up damaging parts or pulling your hair out trying to figure out why things aren't working as expected. With prebuilt gaming PC deals, you get to skip some of the more time-consuming and frustrating parts of the process, but you'll pay for the privilege and likely spend more money overall.
