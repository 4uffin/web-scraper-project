Want Cheap Eats Sent to Your Door? These Are the Best Meal Delivery Deals for Fall
We found heavy discounts on meals and groceries from Hungryroot, CookUnity, ButcherBox and more.

David Watsky
19 meal kits on sale
Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Hot take incoming: Food is expensive these days. From inflated groceries to skyrocketing restaurant prices, it's hard to find a proper deal in 2025. Meal kit costs, on the other hand, haven't inflated as quickly as other food categories, and most services offer massive discounts to new subscribers and returning customers. If you're curious about meal kits or prepared meals, you won't have to spend much to try it and there's no limit to how many meal delivery deals you can cash in on before you decide.We found offers good for weeks of meals from services including HelloFresh, Home Chef and EveryPlate for less than a night of takeout and comparable to grocery shopping for the same ingredients -- without having to go to the store. These low-commitment offers are designed to tempt, and as someone who has tested all the meal kit services -- these are the best -- I say you should absolutely take the bait.Best Meal Kits for 2025, Tested and Reviewed

My pro tip: Sign up, snag the deal, and set a reminder to pause or cancel before the full price kicks in. It’s one of the easiest ways to test-drive new menus and see what fits your schedule, whether you're grilling poolside or just trying to stay out of a hot kitchen
We found meal kit deals starting at under $3 a serving. Dinnerly/CNETDiscounts we found include deals on meal kits such as HelloFresh and Dinnerly and prepared services, including CookUnity, Factor and Daily Harvest. These offers net you savings as big as $235 for healthy meal kits, keto meal kits, prepared meals and even meat, seafood and grocery delivery.

EveryPlate You won't find cheaper meal kits than from EveryPlate. All three CNET editors that tested the service found there were plenty of satisfying dinners for the incoming cold weather.

HelloFresh HelloFresh has the most recipe options per week of any meal kit service -- more than 100 on the standard plan -- with lots of substitutions and swaps available.

Gobble Gobble is quite similar to the other services, except that many items come already chopped, peeled, marinated and so on -- which can save you some prep time. The two meals I received, Yankee pot roast and cacio e pepe, were terrific. Dinner prices are normally a flat $12 per serving, so you do pay a bit extra for that convenience.

Make dinner in under 20 minutes with speedy meal kits. David Watsky/CNETIf it's the lowest possible cost, EveryPlate, HelloFresh, Purple Carrot and Gobble will send meal kits that are ready to cook, with some clocking in at under $2 per serving. Other popular prepared-meal services such as CookUnity are ready to send premade, ready-to-eat dinners to your doorstep, at per-serving prices that are far cheaper than takeout. What's the best meal delivery service?
Cook Unity has some of the best prepared meals of any service we tried.
David Watsky/CNETI've tried most of them and they're all solid, with differences to consider depending on your budget, diet, taste and kitchen skill level. You can check out CNET's roundups of the best meal kit delivery services and thebest healthy food delivery services for a more detailed taste. Remember, nearly all of these meal kit companies let you pause or cancel anytime, so the risk and commitment when signing up for a meal kit service is minimal.Whether you're looking for ways to eat healthily, learn to cook new recipes or just make fewer trips to the grocery store this fall, a healthy, versatile and budget-friendly meal delivery deal can help you do it on the cheap.
Fresh seafood is an option with most meal kit services. David Watsky/CNETThese offers were valid at the time of publication, but they can end at any time and may be restricted by geography and other cookie-based conditions in your browser. If you don't see a deal populate, try in a new window or private browser. In the meantime, if you've already tried one or more of these, tell me which ones and what you liked or didn't like.My advice: Take advantage of one of these offers (making sure to pause or cancel after, unless you want to continue). You can see which service you like best and get super cheap takeout-style meals for weeks at a time. Is it easy to cancel a meal kit service?
I restested EveryPlate and it's still my favorite cheap meal kit service. David Watsky/CNETVirtually all of the services we tried allow you to pause or cancel any time just in case you don't love it, so there's almost no risk after the deal is up, but you may have to unsubscribe from their email blasts. Most brands just want you to try out the meals and see if you dig them and those brands are willing to make it very easy (and cheap) to do that. To make things easier, we already tried the top meal kits and meal delivery services so you'll know exactly what to expect and you can pick the best food delivery deal for you and your tastes.
