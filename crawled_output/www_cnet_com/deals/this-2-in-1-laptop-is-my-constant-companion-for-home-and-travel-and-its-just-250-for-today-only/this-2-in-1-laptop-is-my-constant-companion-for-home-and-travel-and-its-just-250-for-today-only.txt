The Lenovo Duet 11's compact size makes it ideal for commuting or traveling. Josh Goldman/CNET
I'll admit it: After years of testing tablets and laptops here at CNET, I get just as excited when I find an inexpensive device that does much more than I expected as I do when I test laptops costing hundreds or thousands of dollars more.The Lenovo Duet 11 Chromebook, a CNET Editors' Choice Award winner, definitely falls into the former category -- it lets you do a lot for not a lot of money. Sure, it might not be powerful enough to be your one-and-only computer, but as a sidekick on a daily commute, as a second screen on the couch or writing down notes during a work meeting, it's hard to beat. I especially appreciate the versatility of the Lenovo Duet 11 Chromebook. It has an 11-inch touchscreen paired with a detachable keyboard cover, a rear cover with a kickstand, and, if you want, you can pair it with an active pen for drawing or note-taking on the screen.Better yet, at less than $400, it's one of the best laptop deals around. Even better, it's currently just $250 at Best Buy, so it's a bargain that's too good to pass up. Just be warned that this deal is a one-day-only affair (17 September), so time is running out to take advantage.$250 at Best Buy

First is its compact, lightweight size. Second is that it's multifunctional. Since I regularly commute to work by train, both of these factors make the Duet Chromebook especially convenient. On occasions when I do need a bigger screen or a wider keyboard for faster typing, I'll usually switch to my standard laptop. But the Duet 11, which functions both as a laptop and tablet, is the machine that fits my daily life the best and most often. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.On the surface, you might think it's no different than an iPad or any number of Android tablets. But the big differences are the operating system, ChromeOS, and its price. If you've never used ChromeOS, it's sort of a mix between a traditional desktop OS, such as Windows or MacOS, and a mobile OS that your phone uses, such as Android.The combination makes it easier for me to get work done with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse, but it also uses apps from the Google Play Store, so it has a mobile device feel too. The only hiccup might be if your work or school relies on software available only for MacOS or Windows. That's never been an issue for me, as there's typically a web or mobile app I can use in its place.Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11 specsPrice$399Display size/resolution11-inch 1,920x1,200-pixel, LCD touchscreenCPU2.6GHz MediaTek Kompanio 838Memory8GB LPDDR4XGraphicsIntegrated graphicsStorage128GB eMMCNetworkingIntel Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1PortsUSB-C 3.2 Gen 1 (x2), 3.5mm combo audio jackOperating systemChromeOSThe Duet 11 helps me stay busy during my train commute
The Duet's size is really nice for my train commute, letting me easily edit docs or respond to emails on my way to work. It has a fantastic front-facing 5-megapixel camera, too, so I can use it for a Zoom chat when necessary, and the camera has a physical privacy shutter to block it out the rest of the time. I especially like its zippy performance. It wakes as soon as I drop the keyboard open, and I can quickly tether to my Pixel phone for an instant internet connection. Battery life is strong at up to 11 hours in my use of it.Using the Duet on your lap can be a little bit of a balancing act, but it's doable. Its compact size makes it ideal for cramped coffee shop tables and other places where a full-size laptop might be awkward. It weighs only about 2 pounds with all of its accessories.Read more: Why a Chromebook Is Probably All You NeedLike a lot of people, I unwind on my commute home with some entertainment, and the Duet shines for that. Pop off the magnetically attached keyboard and ChromeOS switches to a more touch-friendly experience. The tablet supports cloud gaming services such as Xbox Game Pass and Nvidia GeForce Now, which means that with a strong web connection, you can play all kinds of games. I love to play mobile games on it from the Play Store too.

The Duet 11 also works as an e-reader
In addition to being ideal for commuting and cramped spaces, the Duet is also a good e-reader. I use it for reading manga with the Viz and Shonen Jump apps, and I regularly dip into my library's collection of ebooks and magazines via the Libby app. The device is also good for streaming video and music, though I prefer Bluetooth headphones over the tablet's little speakers.While I mainly use it for travel and on my commute, the Duet is equally great around the house. I wouldn't recommend the Duet as your only laptop unless you simply don't need to do more than basic home office work and can connect to a larger display, keyboard and mouse. The 11-inch touchscreen, while great-looking, is a little too small for all-day, everyday use. But as a secondary device to a larger, more powerful desktop or laptop, it's just about perfect.If you're interested in checking out more ChromeOS devices, here are CNET's top picks for the best Chromebooks on the market.
