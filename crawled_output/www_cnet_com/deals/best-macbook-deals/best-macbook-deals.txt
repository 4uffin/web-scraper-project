Best M2 MacBook dealsNow two generations old, the M2 MacBook Pro is getting a little tough to find in stock. We did spot a refurbished model for $615 at BackMarket. There are no available discounts on new models at the moment, but we will keep an eye and share if a solid drop pops up. We did however spot a deal on the M2 MacBook Air.
M2 MacBook Air (13-inch): $699
Although the M2 chip isn't as fast as the M3 or M4, it's still a nice leap from the M1. At a more affordable price, it's may be a great option if you're sporting an older-gen MacBook and are ready to upgrade without needing the bells and whistles of the Pro or the latest processor. This version has 16GB of memory and 256GB of storage and a 13-inch screen. Plus, with Best Buy's trade-in program you have the potential to knock even more off the price.

MacBook deals FAQs
When are the best MacBook deals available?
You can occasionally find MacBooks on sale throughout the year, but the deals are unpredictable, short-lived and typically fall short of the prices we see during major shopping events. If you're looking to grab an Apple laptop at the lowest price possible, you'll want to save your shopping for Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Amazon Prime Day. If you don't want to wait for the next major event, be on the lookout for weekend flash sales at major retailers like Best Buy, as they're fairly frequent and often feature big discounts on Apple tech.
Which retailers have the best MacBook deals?
Apple rarely offers discounts on its own devices, so you'll have to look elsewhere if you're hoping to find a MacBook on sale. Major retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart are good places to start, especially during major shopping events. However, it's also worth seeing what deals are available at smaller online retailers like Adorama, B&H Photo and Newegg, as they may offer some under-the-radar bargains that aren't being matched at larger competitors.
What should I look for in a MacBook deal?
One of the most important factors to consider is which configuration is on sale. A $500 discount might look enticing, but it may be exclusive to an upgraded version of the laptop with maxed-out specs, so you'll ultimately end up paying more for expensive hardware you may not need. Be sure to check the storage, memory, screen size and processor to make sure the configuration fits your needs and your budget.
Should I buy a MacBook from Apple directly?
While Amazon, Best Buy and Adorama typically have the best prices, one benefit to paying full price and buying from Apple is that you can customize the machine, adding more RAM or a higher-capacity solid-state drive. The models sold by Amazon and other retailers have fixed configurations.It's also worth noting that you can find refurbished MacBooks on Apple's Certified Refurbished Mac page. Refurb inventory changes rapidly, so you might not always see the latest MacBook Air or Pro available. If you're on the hunt for a specific model, it's worth keeping an eye on this page because you can lock in substantial savings.Apple also offers students an educational discount, which can trim hundreds of dollars from the price of a new laptop or tablet.
