Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
People who wear glasses and contact lenses know how expensive these essentials can get. This is especially true for those requiring specialty prescriptions, such as progressives, or those who might want prescription sunglasses. Even vision insurance isn't a guarantee that optical necessities will be cheap. Plus, with back-to-school exams, many of us are finding out our children need glasses, too.However, there are plenty of online eyewear stores that offer deals, coupon codes and other ways to save. They often also sell contacts, prescription sunglasses and have tons of options to choose from. Some of these sites also work with vision insurance and accept flexible spending account (FSA) or health savings account (HSA) dollars, so you can compound your savings. As a bonus, some of these sites offer the opportunity to try on glasses before committing to a purchase.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.Looking for a new pair of specs or contacts? We've rounded up some of the best online deals. And if you've signed up for an FSA or HSA through your employer, you might be able to apply some of those funds to purchases from the retailers listed. For more information, check out our FSA guide.

Glasses USA If you're looking for new glasses, Glasses USA has some of the best offers. There are discounts on frames and lenses, so no matter what you're looking for, you're likely to find it there for less. You can score 30% off site-wide with the code SAVE30. Plus, there are even more offers to take advantage of:  Buy one, get one free: With the code BOGOFREE, you can get a second pair of glasses for free. The order can include one "premium" frame, and the discount will cover the cheaper of the two pairs of glasses. 30% off frames: If you need only a single pair of glasses, use coupon code SAVE30 for 30% off and free shipping. This applies only to frames with basic prescription lenses, and it's not compatible with premium, on-sale or "new arrival" glasses. The coupon can be used to save on sunglasses as well. If you want more savings on sunglasses, use the code SUNNIES10 to save $10 on any pair of sunglasses.Other deals include 50% off lens upgrades with the code LENSES50, and you can save on select designer frames (although quite a few brands are excluded) with the promo code DESIGNER40. If you need glasses and contacts at the same time, when you spend over $120 on contacts, you can get a pair of glasses for free. Use the offer code FREE-GLASSES.
