Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Choosing a cell carrier is trickier than it seems considering all the factors that go into it. You have to think about the coverage in your area, which plan makes the most sense for you and what kind of phone you want. But you should also take a look at the deals being offered. Whether it's a free phone or a few bucks off your monthly bill, they can often help you lock in some significant savings. And T-Mobile has some incredible options to choose from.However, these offers typically come loaded with red tape and fine print, which can make it pretty tough to take advantage of them. To help spare you the headache, we've detailed some of T-Mobile's best deals below. Just note that the details of these deals change fairly often so don't wait too long or you could miss out.Best T-Mobile phone dealsMany of T-Mobile's phone deals are available to new and existing customers, although trade-ins are often required to get the advertised prices. Keep in mind the deals are split across 24 months of bill credits, meaning you must remain a T-Mobile customer for at least two years for the phone to be paid off as the terms state. If you cancel before that period is over, you'll be responsible for any remaining charges.
Apple iPhone 16 series T-Mobile is offering many trade-in and new-line discounts on the iPhone 16 series. Exchanging your old phone will save you up to $1,000 if you have an Experience Beyond plan, which scores you the basic iPhone 16, 16 Plus or 16 Pro free. People on an Experience More plan can get up to $830 off when they trade in an old device for a free basic iPhone 16. Those on most other plans will get up to $300.T-Mobile is also offering savings when you switch your number over from another eligible carrier. Switching to an Experience Beyond plan will save you $1,000, and an Experience More plan will save you $830.You also can save up to $830 with a new line and a trade-in on most plans. There also are special offers for military members, first responders and folks older than 55.

T-Mobile FAQs
Are T-Mobile deals only available to new customers?
Up until recently, T-Mobile heavily favored new customers with its best deals, leaving existing customers behind. That's changed; now most of the offers are available for new and existing customers under the same terms. Just note that select offers will require the activation of a new line of service.
How do T-Mobile's discounts work?
It's easy to see up to $1,000 off the price of something and get excited but you'll want to make sure you know what you're signing up for. T-Mobile applies these discounts as bill credits that are usually spread across 24 months. Sometimes, part of the discount amount is given in the form of a prepaid gift card (for a trade-in), and the rest is done as bill credits, but that's specified when it's happening.
What happens if you leave T-Mobile before the 24 months are up?
If you don't stick with T-Mobile through the full 24 months of bill credits, you'll be responsible for all the remaining charges. Before canceling or transferring your service to another carrier, be sure to reach out to T-Mobile to determine what you'll actually owe, ensuring you can cover that before making the move.
