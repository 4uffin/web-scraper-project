Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Fall is when most major brands unveil their new generation of phones. It's a great time to upgrade, as most carriers offer some substantial launch discounts to help you put a new phone in your pocket for less. If you're looking to grab a new iPhone 17, Google Pixel 10 or one of Samsung's eye-catching foldable phones, you'll find some great offers now at T-Mobile, which is offering hundreds off for those adding a new line or switching carriers. Plus, there are a handful of plan deals that can help knock a few bucks off your monthly bill.However, these offers typically come loaded with red tape and fine print, which can make it pretty tough to take advantage of them. To help spare you the headache, we've detailed some of T-Mobile's best deals below. Just note that the details of these deals change fairly often so don't wait too long or you could miss out.Best T-Mobile phone dealsMany of T-Mobile's phone deals are available to new and existing customers, although trade-ins are often required to get the advertised prices. Keep in mind the deals are split across 24 months of bill credits, meaning you must remain a T-Mobile customer for at least two years for the phone to be paid off as the terms state. If you cancel before that period is over, you'll be responsible for any remaining charges.
Apple iPhone 17 series The brand-new iPhone 17 series is available for preorder now at T-Mobile, and you may even be able to put one of these next-gen models in your pocket for free. T-Mobile is offering some substantial savings for those who switch their existing number over from another carrier. You'll save $1,000 if you switch to an Experience Beyond or Go 5G Next plan, or $830 when you switch to an Experience More. There are also exclusive plans and offers for military members, first responders and people over 55. Discounts are applied as bill credits over 24 months.

Samsung Galaxy S25 series Those who need a new line can score some serious savings on the Galaxy S25 lineup right now at T-Mobile, though the discount will depend on which plan you have. You'll save $600 with a new line on an Essentials or other qualifying plan, which scores you the new Galaxy S25 FE for free. Those on an Experience More or Go5G Plus plan will get $800 off, which means you can grab the basic Galaxy S25 for free.

Best T-Mobile plan dealsIf you're looking to switch to T-Mobile, there are a few deals on various plans that might help you decide. Promotions on plans are less common these days, although often you can get some free extras, like streaming service subscriptions, music subscriptions and extra travel data, with enrollment in some of the higher-end 5G plans from each carrier, including T-Mobile.
3rd-line discounts Customers who are looking to move to T-Mobile and sign up for three lines of service will be happy to hear that the carrier is offering a buy two, get one free promotion, meaning the third line won't cost you anything. This offer is available to those on its Essentials, Experience More or Experience Beyond plans, and could save you as much as $60 per month.

T-Mobile FAQs
Are T-Mobile deals only available to new customers?
Up until recently, T-Mobile heavily favored new customers with its best deals, leaving existing customers behind. That's changed; now most of the offers are available for new and existing customers under the same terms. Just note that select offers will require the activation of a new line of service.
How do T-Mobile's discounts work?
It's easy to see up to $1,000 off the price of something and get excited but you'll want to make sure you know what you're signing up for. T-Mobile applies these discounts as bill credits that are usually spread across 24 months. Sometimes, part of the discount amount is given in the form of a prepaid gift card (for a trade-in), and the rest is done as bill credits, but that's specified when it's happening.
What happens if you leave T-Mobile before the 24 months are up?
If you don't stick with T-Mobile through the full 24 months of bill credits, you'll be responsible for all the remaining charges. Before canceling or transferring your service to another carrier, be sure to reach out to T-Mobile to determine what you'll actually owe, ensuring you can cover that before making the move.
