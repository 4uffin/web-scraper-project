Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Tariffs are having a major impact on prices across the board, and the PlayStation 5 is no exception. Starting Aug. 21, Sony will increase the prices of its PlayStation 5 consoles in the US, which follows Microsoft and Nintendo raising prices for their hardware. The base PS5 will increase from $500 to $550, while the digital edition will rise from $450 to $500. And if you opt for the PlayStation 5 Pro, you'll pay $750 instead of the previous $700 list price. PlayStation cited a "challenging economic environment" for the increases. If you're looking to get one at the lowest cost, you'll need to hurry. We're also keeping an eye out for any discounts on games, controllers, headsets, SSDs and other gaming accessories to help you save. Note that most deals are short-lived so if you like something, don't wait too long to grab it. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  PlayStation console dealsPlayStation has been around for 30 years and this fall will mark the fifth anniversary of Sony's popular PlayStation 5 console. Since then, Sony has released the PS5 Slim and the PS5 Pro as well, aiming to reach a wider audience -- the latter of which pushes the console's graphical fidelity and ray-tracing capabilities to the next level. Whichever PS5 version you choose, you'll immediately access a vast library of magnificent experiences, with several platform exclusives.
PlayStation 5 Pro: $700 Now's the last chance you'll have to nab the PlayStation 5 Pro for $700. Starting Aug. 21, you'll pay $750 due to price increases. We've gathered some top retailers who still have stock at the lower price.
