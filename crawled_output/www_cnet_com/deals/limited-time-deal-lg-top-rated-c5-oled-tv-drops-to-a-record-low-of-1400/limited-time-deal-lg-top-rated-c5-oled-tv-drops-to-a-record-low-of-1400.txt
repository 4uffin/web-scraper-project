$1,400 at Woot$1,597 at AmazonOLED TVs are the best and brightest on the market right now, offering almost unrivaled vibrancy and detail. But as you may expect, these premium models don't come cheap. If you've been holding out for a new TV, now might be the moment to pull the trigger.Woot currently has the 65-inch LG C5 OLED TV down to $1,400, one of the lowest prices we've seen on this set. This is almost the same price the 2024 C4 model goes for, which has been one of our picks for best value OLED on the market. That makes this a rare chance to grab the latest version at last year's price. It's also a solid discount compared with Amazon where the same set is listed for $1,597.Keep in mind, the Woot listing is for an international model, so while you're saving a couple hundred bucks upfront, some buyers may prefer the peace of mind that comes with US version on Amazon -- especially with tariffs looming over people's heads. Either way, this is the cheapest this TV has gone, and you may not have another chance after Sept. 21 since this is limited-time clearance sale. LG C5 OLED TV: $1,400 (Original price: $2,697)
See at Woot
The LG C5 OLED builds on everything we already loved about the C4 series, with some meaningful upgrades. It features LG's brightness-boosting tech, plus UL-certified glare-free performance, which should help in brighter rooms. Expect the trademark OLED "perfect black" and "perfect color" reproduction with measured black levels below 0.24 nits.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.LG has also pushed the peak brightness up to around 1,400 nits, about 200 more than the previous C4 series. That extra punch helps HDR content pop, especially with support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 baked in. In short: movies and games look stunning, no matter the lighting. In his review, CNET's TV expert, Ty Pendlebury, highlighted its excellent uniformity in both solid colors and high-contrast content, as well as its wide off-axis viewing -- an area where OLED typically outshines LCD competitors. While he felt that the newer features like Voice ID and personalized viewing suggestions weren't essential, the processing itself consistently delivered sharper, cleaner visuals across different content types. If this isn't the TV for you, take a look at our full roundup on the best TV deals going on right now and our picks of best TVs for September.$1,400 at Woot

On top of that, the C-series may be widely regarded as LG's sweet spot offering premium features without venturing into the more expensive G-series territory.For shoppers wanting a top-tier OLED experience without stretching their budget thin, this $1,400 price is about as good as it gets right now.
