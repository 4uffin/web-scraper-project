Best Pixel 9A dealsWe're expecting a Pixel 10A next year, but till then, Pixel 9A is the latest model in Google's budget-friendly A-series lineup and a pretty incredible value at just $499 -- matching, or even exceeding, the main Pixel 9 in some categories.It has a more substantial battery (although slower charging) and features the same Tensor G4 chipset as the 9, which means it also supports Gemini AI features. It also features the same screen as the basic Pixel 9, with a 6.3-inch OLED display and 2,700 nits of brightness. You're sacrificing a bit of memory at just 8GB of RAM, along with some image resolution on the rear camera. You can get all the details in our full breakdown.
Pixel 9A at Google: From $0 Google isn't offering any direct discounts at the moment, but if you're looking to join Google Fi, new customers will get $499 back in bill credits, which will net you the basic 128GB model free. Google also has its own trade-in program that can save you up to $625 in exchange for your old phone, which could also get you a free Pixel 9A, although remember that the best trade-in prices are paid for more recent phones.

Pixel 8 and 8 Pro dealsReleased in late 2023, the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are now two generations old. They feature a next-gen Tensor G3 processor, convenient AI features and improved screens. Right now, these models -- and deals on them -- are a little scarce.
Pixel 8 series at Google: From $599 You can save hundreds when you trade in your old phone. Discounts will vary depending on your device's year, condition and configuration. More recent devices, like an iPhone 15 Pro Max or Galaxy Z Fold 6, will net about $500, although you'd be looking closer to the $200 mark for something from a few years ago.

What is the best Pixel deal right now?If you're looking to get the most bang for your buck, Google's deals on the new Pixel 9A are a good value. You can save with an eligible trade-in; the savings will depend on the device you hand over. Plus, new Google Fi customers can pick up the basic 128GB model free without the need to trade in a device.
Pixel Fold dealsThe Pixel Fold was Google's first foldable device and it's the predecessor to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It features a 5.8-inch cover screen, a 7.6-inch OLED internal screen, 12GB of RAM, a Tensor G2 processor and an intimidating $1,799 starting price. It's getting pretty tough to find these original foldables in stock -- especially with a new model on the shelves. Right now, there aren't a lot of deals but you might find a refurbished model at a decent price.How we choose Pixel deals at CNETMany of us here at CNET have covered deals on top tech for more than five years, including cell phone deals from major brands like Apple, Google, Samsung and OnePlus. In that time, we've learned how to spot the best deals from trustworthy retailers and carriers to simplify the phone buying process. We look for direct discounts, trade-in offers and other bonuses offered for unlocked and carrier phones to help you score the best deal and avoid online shopping scams.
Pixel deals FAQs
When are the best Pixel deals usually offered?
Unlike most other gadgets, phone deals aren't quite as dependent on seasonal shopping events, so you can usually find good bargains year-round. We do see an uptick in offers during major sales like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The other best time to score serious savings is when a new model is announced, as this usually precipitates discounts and price drops on older models. Google typically unveils its new flagship phones in late summer or early fall and its affordable Pixel A series usually gets an update in spring.
Which retailers offer the best Pixel deals?
It's pretty uncommon to find straightforward discounts on Pixel phones at major retailers like Amazon and Walmart, although they do pop up on occasion. If you're looking for more substantial and consistent savings, you're better off seeing what deals are being offered by major carriers like AT&T and Verizon, as well as smaller carriers like Mint Mobile. They usually have the biggest discounts, especially if you have an older phone to trade in or need a new line of service. Google has also been known to offer straightforward discounts on its own devices.
Which Pixel phone is the best value?
The Pixel 9A offers the most bang for your buck. It lists for just $499 but matches -- or even exceeds -- the $799 Pixel 9 in some categories. It has a more substantial battery (though slower charging) and features the same Tensor G4 chipset as the flagship lineup, which means it also supports Gemini AI features. It also features the same screen as the basic Pixel 9, with a 6.3-inch OLED display (same as Pixel 10) and 2,700 nits of brightness. You're sacrificing a bit of memory at just 8GB of RAM, along with some image resolution on the rear camera.
