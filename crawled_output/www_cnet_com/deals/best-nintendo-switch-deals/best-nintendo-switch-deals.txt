Nintendo/CNET
The new Nintendo Switch 2 console dropped in June, but at almost $500 it isn't exactly a budget buy. We're keeping tabs on where to buy yours if you're ready to shell out for the latest handheld -- but if you're not ready to spend that much, yet still want to upgrade your gaming setup, the older-generation models are still great devices to invest in. Nintendo recently announced price increases across previous-gen Switch lineups, and prices on the Switch 2 may be subject to increases in the future, but we're looking out for deals to help you beat the rising costs. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.CNET's resident gaming expert, Scott Stein, along with our dedicated deals team, has scoured the web to bring you the best bargains on previous-generation models, games and accessories. We'll keep updating this page with the latest offers, so check back often.

Best Nintendo Switch deals
Nintendo Switch OLED: $299 Nintendo is increasing the price of the Switch OLED model to $400 (from $350), but right now Walmart has both the red/blue and the white versions of the console for just $299, making this an excellent deal for those not upgrading to the Switch 2. The Nintendo Switch OLED is an upgrade over the standard Switch console if you're a fan of handheld gaming thanks to its 7-inch OLED display and doubled 64GB of storage. Additionally, its kickstand and speakers are improved over the standard version, too, and an added Ethernet port to the dock is a welcomed enhancement. If you've been holding out for a discount amid the excitement over the new Switch 2, this OLED find is your best bet to get yourself this hybrid console at a steal.

Nintendo Switch Lite (Hyrule Edition) plus 12 months of Switch Online: $215
While no direct discounts are up for grabs on a Nintendo Switch Lite at the moment, the best option out there is to pick up the Zelda-themed Switch and get 12 months of Switch Online thrown in for free. This Newegg deal retails for $5 more than the original price of $210, but it is still worth grabbing because this bundle is quite hard to find in stock these days.

It's down to $299 from $350 -- and avoids the incoming price increase to $400. However, if you already have a Switch, you won't want to miss your chance to get extra storage via Lexar's 1TB microSD card for just $85. It will help you expand your library. Or nab The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom game for just $52. Our gaming experts have ranked this as one of the best Nintendo Switch games to play right now, and rightfully so. Everything from the fantasy world to the storyline and gameplay is impressive. It also introduces two new areas -- Sky Islands and Depths.

Eight years may have passed since the console first hit store shelves, but Nintendo likes to keep its hardware and first-party games as close to their standard costs as possible. And with market conditions changing, the cost of the original lineup of consoles is rising. That said, it's still possible to score some savings if you get a little creative. Some retailers still offer limited-time console deals, while other great options can include console bundles, which come with free games or a Nintendo Switch Online subscription that saves you money overall. If you find one with a game you already know you want to buy, these bundle deals are a fantastic way to keep costs down.
Nintendo Switch deals FAQs
What should you look for in a Nintendo Switch deal?
In addition to looking for direct price drops on the Nintendo Switch itself, broaden your search to include Nintendo Switch bundles. Since the console alone rarely falls far from its retail price, these are some of the best ways to save on related accessories that you would have bought anyway. When it comes to Nintendo Switch bundles that include a game, it's a good idea to check what the game costs separately to ensure you're getting the best value.
When are the best Nintendo Switch deals available?
Truly great Nintendo Switch deals are rare, but the best times to find a discount are during major sales like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Which retailers usually offer the best Nintendo Switch deals?
For most people, searching for a great Nintendo Switch deal should start at Amazon or a big-box retailer such as Best Buy, Target or Walmart. These major retailers are most likely to offer direct discounts and bundles and often match each other's deals during major sales. Woot, which is a subsidiary of Amazon, can be particularly good for discounts but only offers limited quantities. Gaming-specific retailers, including GameStop in the US and Game in the UK, are also worth keeping tabs on. Nintendo also offers a rotating selection of pretty enticing digital game deals if you're also looking to add a few titles to your library.
Will there be a Nintendo Switch 2?
Following months of leaks, the Nintendo Switch 2 was unveiled by Nintendo in January. The new model is larger, with a sturdier stand and new magnetic Joy-Cons. It has now finally launched, and is retailing for almost $500. If you are looking to get your hands on the new model, keep an eye on our stock tracker guide for the latest availability information and restocks.
