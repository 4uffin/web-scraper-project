Garmin/Lego/Roborock/CNET
Labor Day has come and gone and Black Friday is still a few months away, so we're in a bit of a lull for major sales right now. But that doesn't mean there aren't some great bargains out there -- you may just have to do a little digging to find them. Fortunately, CNET's shopping experts have years of experience tracking down the best bargains, and we've rounded up some of today's top picks at Walmart below. For Sept. 15, that includes over $300 off a Roborock Q5 DuoRoller Plus robot vacuum, a Garmin Vivoactive 5 fitness tracker that's over $70 off and a 2025 Lego City advent calendar that's on sale for just $25 right now.Roborock Q5 DuoRoller Plus: $260 (save $340)
$260 at Walmart
Grab this advanced Roborock while it's on sale for more than 50% off and you can take vacuuming off your to-do list for good. It boasts 5,500Pa of suction power and is equipped with double rollers to tackle serious messes on both carpet and hardwood floors. Lidar navigation allows it to determine the most efficient cleaning route for your home, and you can even create custom room-by-room schedules and routines. Plus, the 2.5-liter base station can hold up to seven weeks of debris for almost two months of maintenance-free cleaning.Garmin Vivoactive 5: $226 (save $74)
$226 at Walmart
This Garmin smartwatch is now on sale for nearly half the price of the new Apple Watch Series 11, and is a great value for more fitness-focused users. It's equipped with more than 30 preset sport modes so you can get detailed information about your workout, plus it gives you insights about your stress levels, sleep patterns and when you should take a rest day. It's equipped with a 1.2-inch AMOLED display so you can easily read the screen even on sunny days, and boasts an impressive 11-day battery life. It's also got some convenient smart features like a tap-to-pay function and the ability to download playlists from Spotify and Amazon Music.Lego City 2025 advent calendar: $25 (save $10)
$25 at Walmart
Though it's only September, it's never too early to start thinking about the holidays. This 186-piece Lego kit is an exciting way to count down the days in December, and is one of our overall favorite advent calendars for 2025. It has 24 different doors for each day leading up to Christmas, and each one contains a minifigure or other festive surprise (as well as clear instructions on the inside of the door). It also comes with a fold-out play mat so kids can create their own holiday scenes. These Lego calendars are pretty popular, and tend to sell out fairly early in the season, so grab this one on sale early while you can.
