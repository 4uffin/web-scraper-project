Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
There are a lot of stellar phones out there, and depending on what you want, there's a large array of options to choose from. While the world of flip phones isn't quite as varied, it's just as powerful, with excellent options like the Galaxy Z Flip 7. While the $1,100 starting price is high, you can get some superb discounts on one of Samsung's latest foldables if you use the Z Flip 7 deals below. But if you'd rather check out its larger sibling, take a look at the best deals on the Galaxy Z Fold 7.CNET reviewer Patrick Holland was impressed by the new Galaxy Z Flip 7 in almost every way, specifically citing its thinner design, smaller crease and stunning AMOLED display. It has a 4.1-inch cover screen and a 6.9-inch interior display and is just 4.2mm thick when open (or 8.9mm when closed). It also has an Exynos 2500 processor, 12GB of RAM, a 4,300-mAh battery and a high-res 50-megapixel rear camera. Plus, there are 12-megapixel front cameras on both the cover and interior screen, which makes it easy to take selfies from afar.There's also the more affordable Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which starts at $900 rather than $1,100. It has a slightly smaller display and thicker design, as well as an Exynos 2400 processor and 8GB of RAM. But it's still equipped with the same 50-megapixel camera and has many of the same features, including IP48 water resistance, 25-watt fast charging and onboard AI.Best Galaxy Z Flip 7 deals
