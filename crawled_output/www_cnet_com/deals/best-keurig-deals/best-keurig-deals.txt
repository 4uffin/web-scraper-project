A cup of coffee to begin the day is a necessity for many of us. So instead of spending big at a local coffee house, why not invest in a top coffee maker from Keurig? If you are looking for fresh coffee or barista-style espresso drinks and also want to enjoy the convenience of simply pushing a button to get your fix, Keurig machines are one of the best coffee maker options out there.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.After reviewing coffee machines and espresso makers alike, many of our editors have found that their favorite choices are made by Keurig. These machines come in an array of models that are fast, efficient and simple to use. Here are all the best deals happening now on popular Keurig models. Regardless of whether you want a simple cup of java, an iced coffee or a fancy latte, there's a Keurig machine that can meet your needs. These discounts make a great excuse to upgrade or treat someone this holiday season.We'll continue to update this page as deals come and go, so be sure to check back often for the best offers currently available. Best Keurig deals
Keurig K-Elite: $110 At $80 off, the K-Elite is ideal for the serious Keurig connoisseur. Its features include a brew-over-ice function, a strong-brew setting for an extra-bold cup and a button for hot water on demand. It can brew individual cups of 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 ounces, and with a removable drip tray, it can even accommodate travel mugs. Note the low price is for the gold and silver variants.

Keurig K-Classic: $100 With a list closer to $150, you can save $50 on the K-classic. This Keurig model falls between the K-Slim and K-Elite. It's a single-cup brewer with size options of 6, 8 or 10 ounces, and with a 48-ounce tank, you can brew up to six cups before having to refill it. It also has a removable drip tray, so you can fit a travel mug of up to 7 inches for taking your coffee to-go. On sale in red or black.

Keurig K-Select: $80 The K-Select is a slightly more versatile version of the K-Classic above. It allows you to input your own cup size, rather than choose from preset options, as well as adjust the strength of your coffee. It has a 52-ounce reservoir, so it can brew up to five cups before needing a refill, and it has an auto shut-off function in case you forget to switch it off on your way out the door in the morning. It's available and on sale in four different colors.

Keurig K-Mini: $60 As the name suggests, the K-Mini is Keurig's smallest brewer. It holds only enough water to brew a single 6- to 12-ounce cup at a time, so you have to add fresh water after every cup. With no water reservoir, it has a depth of just 11 inches, about 4 inches less than the K-Slim. If saving counter space is your No. 1 priority, the K-Mini is the best Keurig for you. It's the perfect machine for a college dorm or to plant in your home office. It comes in six different colors and all but the red are discounted to $60.

Keurig K-Slim: $80 Slightly larger than the Mini, the Slim is still a single-serve brewer that is less than 5 inches wide. It has a 46-ounce reservoir, so it can make a number of cups before refilling but still takes up very little counter space. All color varients -- black, red and white -- are available with the $50 discount.

Keurig K-Express: $60 Another compact model from Keurig, the K-Express is also on sale. Brew an 8-, 10- or 12-ounce cup, with a 42-ounce reservoir that can make up to four cups before needing to refill. The discount applies to all the colors offered, so you can pick the one that matches your style the best.

Keurig K-Supreme: $138 The Keurig K-Supreme model is down by a decent 24% at Amazon. With multiple brew sizes (6, 8, 10 or 12 ounces), a 66-ounce dual-position reservoir and multistream technology, the machine makes sure the coffee isn't just made fast but is brewed fresh.

How to choose the right KeurigThe best Keurig for you might differ from the one that suits someone else, so it's worth thinking about the right machine for you before pulling the trigger on any old Keurig deal. In addition to your coffee preferences, you'll want to consider what size of the machine will fit into your kitchen, how often you plan to use it, how many people you want to be able to make coffee for at once and any features you desire beyond just simply making coffee, such as a built-in milk frother, direct connection to a water source, adjustable brew temperature, strength-control options and more. Once you've got a list of must-haves, you can more easily identify the right Keurig deal for you.What's so great about Keurigs, anyway?It doesn't matter how you take your coffee, nothing beats that first sip in the morning. Whether you like your morning pick-me-up black and bold or sweet and iced, there's a Keurig brewer out there for you. The brand is known best for its popular and convenient single-cup brewers, but it does plenty more than that too. Keurig makes everything from clever iced coffee brewers to advanced cappuccino and latte makers so everyone can get their caffeine fix just the way they like it.When is the best time to find a Keurig deal?Keurig coffee machines go on sale regularly throughout the year, and we'll ensure we highlight the best Keurig deals above all year round. That being said, the best time to upgrade your coffee-making setup would be during a major sale event such as Prime Day, Labor Day or Black Friday. These are the times when we see the steepest Keurig discounts across a variety of retailers. Read more: Best Air Fryer Deals: Save on Top Models From Bella, Ninja and More
