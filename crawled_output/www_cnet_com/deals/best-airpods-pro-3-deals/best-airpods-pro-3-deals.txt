We're in a whole new era of Apple devices now that the iPhone 17 lineup is out alongside the long-rumored and highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3. It means that now's a great time to be an Apple fan who's looking to upgrade. This is the first new pair of "Pro" earbuds that Apple has unveiled since the AirPods Pro 2 hit shelves in 2022, and they offer some nice improvements over their predecessor. They support new features including live translation, in-ear heart rate monitoring and more than 50 workout modes. They're also a tad smaller than the Pro 2s for a better fit and have a slightly more rugged IP57 water and dust resistance rating. Plus, their improved battery life can now last for up to 10 hours on a single charge.You can check out everything else Apple announced at its latest event, including the iPhone 17 lineup, Apple Watch Series 11 and more.
