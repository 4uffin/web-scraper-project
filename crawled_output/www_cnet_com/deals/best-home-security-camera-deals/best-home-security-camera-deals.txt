Blink's model includes important features like two-way audio, chime alerts, motion detection, live viewing from the app and Alexa compatibility.

Best sale security platform pick
Abode Home Security Deals To celebrate Labor Day, Abode is holding a series of flash sales for up to 50% off, a common option around holidays like this for the security company. That's an especially good deal considering Abode's base systems can be a little pricey, so seeing something like the starter smart security kit drop from $160 to $80 or the five-piece bundle currently at $180 is very promising. Abode excels at third-party smart home support, making it one of the best options for those who have a variety of smart home devices already but want to add security.

When's the best time to buy home security devices?
When a sale week like this one rolls around, it's usually the best time to check out any smart home device for discounts, including home security. The only tricky part is nabbing a great deal before supplies run out, so if you see a notable deal it's time to make a buying decision sooner rather than later.
How we choose the best security device deals
At CNET we have a team of expert shoppers and deal hunters with years of experience. Our goal is to make sure buyers understand which major sales and deals -- such as Black Friday, Prime Day, Memorial Day and countless other shopping events -- are legitimately good and which are more routine. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial deals so you see only the best offers on security devices from retailers all over.
We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.
Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.Reviews are important for any product, but especially for deeply discounted items. If an item breaks the first time you use it, the deal isn't a good one at any price.Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will be around for only a short while or will be available only for the remaining stock, we'll let you know up front so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.We keep our articles as up-to-date as possible to bring you the best current prices.
