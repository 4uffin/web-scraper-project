The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is our favorite foldable phone available, and you can get it with big money off with these deals.

Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
While Apple's new iPhone 17 lineup is the talk of the town right now, those who don't love the Apple ecosystem still have plenty of incredible models to play around with. One thing Samsung fans have that Apple fans don't have is a good foldable, like the Samsung Galaxy Fold 7, which is one of the best phones for 2025. The large-screen Galaxy Z Fold 7 is our overall favorite, but it comes with a staggering $2,000 starting price. As far as direct discounts go, you can save $300 with Samsung, and even more if you're willing to trade in an old phone. Amazon is matching this discount right now, as is Best Buy, both with trade-in offers to sweeten the deal. And of course, you can save hundreds with multiple carriers by trading in an old phone or activating a new line.Samsung's unique foldable phones had a bit of an awkward adolescence, but CNET reviewer Abrar Al-Heeti confirms that the latest Z Fold 7 "just feels right." For one, it's incredibly sleek at just 8.9mm thick when closed or 4.2mm thick when open, which is so thin you may even forget that it's a foldable.Despite weighing just 215 grams, this new foldable also packs some serious hardware. It has a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8-inch interior display with a fluid 120Hz refresh rate. Aside from the screens, the phone has a cutting-edge Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB of RAM to support tons of helpful AI features and functions, and it comes with Android 16 and Samsung One UI 8 right out of the box. The camera system is also impressive. It offers a 200-megapixel rear camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel front camera on both the cover and interior screens. Plus, it has a 4,400-mAh battery for all-day use.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.Best Galaxy Z Fold 7 deals
