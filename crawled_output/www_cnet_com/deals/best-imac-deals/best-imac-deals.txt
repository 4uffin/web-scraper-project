Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Apple is better known for its sleek and popular MacBook laptops, but it makes some excellent desktops as well. The latest M4 iMac is our overall favorite desktop this year, and it's even better now that you can pick one up for even less. There are a handful of discounts on the latest model, and those on a tight budget can check out the 2023 M3 iMac, which is up to $500 off. To help you make the most of these savings, we've rounded up all the best iMac deals out there below.
Apple/CNETBest M4 iMac deals The new M4 chip is even faster, and Apple has (slightly) tweaked the colors that you can choose from, too. The new Macs support Apple Intelligence and will work with the latest MacOS software for years to come. This is clearly the best iMac yet, and we've found all the best prices, so you don't pay a penny more than you need to.
iMac M4 at Apple: From $1,299 There aren't any direct discounts from Apple, but if you use your Apple Card*, you can get 3% off the retail price. And if you have an old device lying around, you can score some extra bucks off with a trade-in. Exact trade-in value depends on the device being traded, with the highest values from M3 iMacs. You'll also get three free months of Apple TV Plus with the purchase, as long as you're a new or returning subscriber.You can choose from seven colors and between an 8-core and 10-core CPU and GPU, as well as different storage options.
