Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Apple unveiled fantastic products during its Apple event earlier this month. We finally got a peek at the new iPhone 17 lineup and AirPods Pro 3. But fans of wearable tech are in for the biggest treat, as Apple revealed specs for three new Apple Watch releases: Apple Watch Series 11, the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3. They're available everywhere on Sept. 19, and can be preordered now at select retailers and carriers.The other great news is that we anticipate many retailers and carriers will be dropping prices and offering deals on the previous-gen Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is still this year's best smartwatch and a dynamic device. We've found several of the best deals on the Ultra 2 that can help you save when you trade in an older device. If you want to save more, you can always get a refurbished original Ultra, which is available in limited quantities. We're monitoring prices daily right now to bring you the latest prices. CNET Senior Editor Adam Oram has worked with our dedicated deals team to bring you the very best offers on the new Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. That includes straightforward discounts, as well as trade-in savings and other special offers (that you'll have to jump through a few hoops to get).Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.
Apple/CNETApple Watches are great buys for fitness and wellness enthusiasts who are well-integrated into the Apple ecosystem. Keep in mind that the company is currently in a patent dispute with a company called Masimo. The most recent update is that the federal appeals court upheld the US International Trade Commission’s ruling that Apple can't sell Apple Watches with the blood oxygen sensing feature. Other than that, the Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2 offer plenty of other features that can track your steps and keep you connected during outdoor outings.Read more: Apple Watch Ultra 2 vs. Apple Watch Ultra: A Rugged Watch ComparisonBest Apple Watch Ultra 3 deals The Apple Watch Ultra 3 was announced during the Apple Event on last week. Watches are expected to ship and make their in-store debut on Sept. 19.
Apple Watch Ultra 3 at Apple: $799 Apple's new and improved rugged Ultra 3 smartwatch comes with an intimidating $799 starting price, but you can knock up to $335 off in exchange for your old wearable. You'll also get 3% cash back when you purchase with an Apple Card.*

Best Apple Watch Ultra 2 dealsReleased in September 2023, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 was previously Apple's most advanced smartwatch until the announcement of the Ultra 3. The Ultra 2 maintains the overall design of its predecessor while upgrading to the S9 chip for faster speeds and better battery efficiency. Plus, there's an extra-bright display. Athletes will benefit from more advanced metrics for running and cycling and the extended altitude range is a boon for hikers and scuba divers. The battery life remains the longest in the Apple Watch lineup at 36 hours per charge or up to 72 hours in low-power mode.Note that now that Apple has launched three new smartwatches, it is no longer selling the Ultra 2 directly on its site.
Apple Watch Ultra 2 at Best Buy: $699 Best Buy is current offering the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $100 off. Additionally, you can save up to $250 with an eligible trade-in. Garmin, Fitbit and Samsung smartwatches are all eligible. However, previous-gen Apple Watch models will score the biggest savings.Best Buy is also throwing in three months of Apple Music and Apple Fitness Plus with any purchase.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 at AT&T: $799 AT&T isn't currently offering any discounts on an Apple Watch Ultra 2 if you buy just one. However, it has a deal that can save you $300 when you buy two, which could be a great deal for families. Additionally, AT&T has its own trade-in program where you can exchange your old phone, tablet or smartwatch for credit. Discounts are applied as bill credits over 36 months.

Best Apple Watch Ultra deals
Apple/CNETApple has discontinued the first-gen Apple Watch Ultra, and most retailers have stopped stocking this model. So deals and direct discounts are few, but you can save some cash if you choose a refurbished model. Apple doesn't currently have any refurbished Ultras in stock.
Apple Watch Ultra at Back Market: $400 Back Market also has a selection of refurbished Apple Watch Ultra models, ranging from fair to excellent condition. They're slightly more affordable than Apple's refurbished models (which are not available right now), although they may exhibit more signs of wear and tear.

Apple Watch Ultra at Best Buy: $430 Best Buy is another retailer that still has some refurbished Apple Watch Ultra models available. Prices start at $430 and they come with four free months of Apple Fitness Plus and three free months of Apple Music.

What is the best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deal right now?Straightforward discounts are pretty much nonexistent for the Ultra 2, so carrier offers such as AT&T's $300 off two
are among the best bets. If you're seeking the Apple Watch Ultra 3, the best trade-in offer
is up to $335 off at Apple. How we choose Apple Watch Ultra deals at CNETFor the Apple Watch Ultra 2, we've highlighted any retailers offering direct discounts. However, these types of discounts can be pretty hard to come by so we've also selected several retailers and carriers that are offering more consistent savings in the form of trade-in discounts, bundle deals or free services. Additionally, we've selected several trusted retailers that have a selection of refurbished first-gen Ultra models for those who want the advanced features of a high-end Apple Watch without the hefty price tag. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 was just announced, so not surprisingly, there are no direct discounts, and right now, Apple is the only place to order one directly. The Ultra 3 will be shipping and in stores on Sept. 19.
Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Ultra 2 deals FAQs
How much does the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and the new Ultra 3 cost?

The Ultra 3 features a larger and brighter display, 5G cellular, an increased battery life (of up to 42 hours) as well as satellite connectivity and a hypertension detector.
