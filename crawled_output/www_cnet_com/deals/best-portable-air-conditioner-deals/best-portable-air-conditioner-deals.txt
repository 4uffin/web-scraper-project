Best Portable Air Conditioner Deals: Stay Cool With Super Summer Savings
Keep any room cool this summer with these unbeatable deals on portable AC units.

Why You Can Trust CNET
Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
Overheating can be a big issue in the summer, especially if you live or work somewhere without central AC. A great solution to this problem is a portable air conditioner.
Not only does it provide cool and comfort, it can help reduce your bills by slashing the use of your main home AC. Since they're smaller and more portable, you can sometimes move them around the home with you as well.Either way, there are a lot of good reasons to have a portable AC, which is why we've gone out and found some of our favorite deals and collected them below. We don't know how quickly these deals will expire, so be sure to snap up anything you like quickly and check back regularly as we update this page with new and better deals.
Costway 9,000-BTU portable air conditioner: $239 This 9,000-BTU Costway air conditioner is a solid midsize model that's designed to cool rooms of up to 280 square feet.
