Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission.
The iPhone 17 certainly offers some nice improvements over its predecessor, but the most exciting model in Apple's latest lineup is the brand-new iPhone Air. It's the first of its kind and the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever -- measuring just 5.6mm thick and weighing in at just 165 grams. Though as you might expect, this cutting-edge model doesn't come cheap.The iPhone Air starts at $999, but fortunately, there's a good chance you'll only have to pay a fraction of that price thanks to some amazing launch discounts. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon are offering some serious savings to those adding a new line or trading in an old phone, which can put one of these sleek new iPhones in your pocket for free. To help you make the most of these offers while they're still available, we've rounded up all the best iPhone Air deals below. And be sure to snag a compatible case for your new phone to keep it protected. Buying a new iPhone Air? Check out the best deals on iPhone accessories like the Apple Watch Series 11, SE 3 and Ultra 3, as well as the AirPods Pro 3.   We've gathered information on where you can order the iPhone Air below. We'll continue to expand this list as more retailers and get stock, too.   Best iPhone Air deals
