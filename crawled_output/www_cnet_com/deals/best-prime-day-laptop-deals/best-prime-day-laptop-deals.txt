Should you shop laptop deals during October Prime Day?Prime Day is still two weeks away but tons of deals are already available so we recommend getting your order in before the October Prime Day madness begins. If you see a laptop that fits your needs and budget for several hundred dollars off, we recommend acting while you can.Does Amazon's October Prime Day offer the best laptop deals?As you might expect, major retailers are offering excellent deals to counter the discounts on Amazon. So, while Amazon Prime Day should be your main focus, we also recommend checking out our coverage of discounts at Walmart and Best Buy to find the perfect deal for you. Plus, smaller, online-only retailers like Adorama and B&H Photo are offering deals that often go under the radar. Lastly, also keep tabs on brand websites because HP and Acer are offering some direct deals of their own.What else is on sale during Amazon Prime Day?There is a huge variety of deals that you can shop for during Amazon Prime Day. These include tons of top tech like TVs and laptops, as well as tons of home goods and big-ticket items like mattresses and major appliances. There are also plenty of seasonal deals on fall and winter essentials to gear up for the colder seasons. To give you a good idea of what's out there, you can check out our full roundup of all the best Amazon Prime Day deals. How we choose the best Amazon October Prime Day laptop dealsMany of us at CNET have covered shopping events for more than five years, including Black Friday, Prime Day, Memorial Day and countless others. We've become good at weeding out scams and superficial deals, so you'll see only the best offers on our lists. When choosing laptop deals, we look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time. Our team of experts has tested hundreds of laptops to ensure we're bringing you the best options at the best prices.Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no brands are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.Quality reviews and testing are important for any product, including laptops. If you're unhappy the first time you turn it on, the discount wasn't worthwhile. Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know up front so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed. Other ways to saveWith potential tariff-related price hikes, now might be the best time to get these kinds of prices on laptops. There's a chance we may not see the same kinds of prices during the next shopping event. Make sure to check out Best Buy and Walmart for even more deals if you can't find one you like on Amazon.
