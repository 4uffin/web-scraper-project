Having a portable power station on hand when the lights go out can be a real lifesaver during a storm or other weather event. It can also be incredibly handy if you're a camper or you just like to enjoy the evenings in your yard or garden. Today is an excellent day to pick one up, too, with Amazon offering the Anker 548 portable generator at a huge 47% off. That means you can pick one up for just $80, the lowest price we've seen on this model.
$80 at AmazonThe Anker 548 power bank is technically a mini power station. It's rectangular and has a built-in handle for easy transportation. Weighing 5.72 pounds, this compact power station is relatively easy for most people to carry. Anker equipped this power station with a 60,000-mAh battery that can charge two devices at once. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  It also has multiple ports, including USB-C and USB-A, so you can charge most devices. It features a simple LCD display and a retractable LED light you can use in low-light situations or power outages. There are multiple ways to keep this power bank charged, including electricity and solar panels.  Looking for other options for portable power? Check out this list of the best portable power station deals available right now.
Top deals available today, according to CNET's shopping experts

Why this deal matters The Anker 548 typically costs $150 and is now down to a much more accessible price of $80. This is the lowest price we've seen on this particular power station. We don't expect it to get much cheaper anytime soon, nor do we think this offer will last long.
