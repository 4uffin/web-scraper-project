As expected, Sept. 9's "awe dropping" Apple event gave us our first look at the highly anticipated iPhone 17 series, along with plenty of details about the new AirPods Pro 3 and the latest Apple Watches.

That means that there are some excellent discounts you can take advantage of right now if you're looking to grab one of these soon-to-be older models.If you're on a tight budget, you can also shop previous-gen models like the iPhone 15. It's getting a little tough to find them in stock, but they're usually available for hundreds off. To help you find the right iPhone for your needs and budget, CNET shopping expert Adam Oram has rounded up the easiest ways to put one in your pocket for less.

Trading in an old phone could save you up to $700, which can potentially score you the basic 128GB model free.

And although the phones in this lineup are now two generations old, they still have plenty to offer, with the basic model even retaining a spot on our list of the best phones. Plus, it's pretty easy to get your hands on one of these previous-gen models for less right now, which makes them a good value for Apple users on a budget. Now that the iPhone 17 lineup has been announced, you can no longer buy the iPhone 15 directly from Apple.
