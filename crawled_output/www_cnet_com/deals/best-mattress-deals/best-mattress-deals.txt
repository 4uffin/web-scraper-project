How we choose mattress deals at CNETMattress deals are pretty prolific, with most major manufacturers offering substantial savings throughout the year. With so many offers, it can be tough to know which deals are truly a good value. That's why this list primarily highlights bargains on mattresses that have been tested and recommended by CNET's team of sleep experts, who evaluate factors like firmness, motion isolation, edge support and construction, as well as which body types and sleeper styles they're best suited for.Factors to consider when choosing a mattress dealWith tons of great deals out there, it's easy to pick the bed with the biggest discount. The savings aren't the only factor you'll want to consider when choosing a new mattress. There are quite a few other variables that you'll need to account for as well.FirmnessOne of the most important things to think about is the firmness you need for comfortable sleep.Side sleepers need a soft-to-medium mattress that will provide plenty of cushion along the pressure points of the shoulders, hips and knees.Back and stomach sleepers generally want a medium-to-firm mattress that promotes natural spinal alignment. You don't have to get the firmest mattress, but you want to ensure you have the support you need.Combination sleepers have the most flexibility in what they choose. It's a good idea to choose firmness based on the position in which you spend the most time.Body typeYour body type will help you decide what bed type and firmness to choose. Generally, we recommend that people over 230 pounds skip all-foam options and choose a hybrid mattress with a supportive steel coil base.Petite body types will put the least pressure on the mattress, meaning a bed will feel firmer to them than the average person. People over 230 pounds will experience the opposite: Beds will feel softer.BudgetThe average online mattress will cost between $800 and $1,200, although prices can go as low as $200 and well over $3,000. With so many mattresses, defining your budget will go a long way in narrowing your options.If you're ready to take advantage of the tons of amazing mattress deals currently available but aren't sure which mattress type is right for you, most online mattress companies offer an at-home sleep trial lasting from a few months up to a full year. If you're unhappy with your purchase, you can get a full refund and have the company collect the mattress from your home. You can't go wrong, and you will hopefully get a much better night's sleep.
