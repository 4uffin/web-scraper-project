$200 at WootWhile many of us associate Dyson with high-quality vacuums, and the viral Airwrap. It also makes some high-end headphones, but they're generally far more expensive than most people would like. Woot currently has a deal on the Dyson Zone active noise-cancelling headphones that brings them down to $200, which is a massive $500 off the normal price. In fact, it works out to a 71% discount -- but the deal is only on until Sept. 21 or until stocks run out. I recommend that you shop sooner rather than later so you don't miss out.Dyson Zone ANC headphones: $200 (Original price: $700)
$200 at Woot
If you live in a city or commute often, you'll appreciate the attachable visor that delivers purified air to your nose and mouth without touching your face. Speaking of being on the move, the battery will last up to 50 hours with just audio and noise cancelation, or 4 hours when the air purification feature is active -- perfect for busy days.Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  This smart device also lets you monitor air quality and tweak settings using the MyDyson app. At $500 off, this is one of those rare deals that don't come around often.Still, if you think this discount isn't for you, check out our list of the best headphones deals to explore some more options. $200 at Woot
HEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK
Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise Cancelling Over-Ear Headphones (Navy):  $298 (save $50)
Soundcore Life Q20 Hybrid Active Noise Cancelling Headphones (Black):  $40 (save $20)
Beats Studio Pro Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones (Black):  $300 (save $51)
Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless ANC Over-Ear Headphones (Black):  $299 (save $151)
Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e ANC Over-Ear Headphones (Black):  $220 (save $180) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.Why this deal mattersDyson is known for precise engineering, and it shows with this pair of headphones. And a rare 71% discount
lets you grab this premium device for way less than half the original price -- but it might not last for long. Quantities on Woot are always pretty limited.So, if you've been looking to upgrade, this is your chance to score the Dyson headphones at a new low price. It's also worth considering that Dyson no longer makes or sells these headphones itself -- so when third-party stock is gone, it's gone for good.
