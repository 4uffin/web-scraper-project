But a shorter version looks like this: The iPhone 17 comes with a new A19 chip, while the 17 Pro and 17 Air get an A19 Pro chip. There is a storage bump as well, up to a starting 256GB. That's double the base 128GB we saw in the previous iPhone 16. Another exciting change coming with this series is iOS 26 and its minimalistic Liquid Glass feature, which was released Sept. 15. But don't fret if you're not a fan of the new interface -- light and dark mode UIs will still be available if you prefer.How much does the iPhone 17 series cost?Prices differ depending on the amount of storage you buy, but here's the range:iPhone 17: From $799 (£799, AU$1,399)iPhone Air: From $999 (£999, AU$1,799)iPhone 17 Pro: From $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,999)iPhone 17 Pro Max: From $1,199 (£1,199, AU$2,199)Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.  What colors do the iPhone 17 models come in?iPhone Air: Space black, cloud white, light gold and sky blue.iPhone 17: Lavender, mist blue, sage, white and black.iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: Silver, cosmic orange and deep blue.Shopping for a previous iPhone model? Our roundup of the best iPhone deals includes sales on the iPhone 16, iPhone 16E, iPhone 15 and more.How do iPhone 17 trade-in offers work?There are multiple carriers offering trade-in savings through Apple, some valued at up to $1,100 on eligible trade-ins, which could net you a free iPhone 17 Pro. Not a fan of contracts? Some retailers also offer trade-in programs, which could offer gift cards toward future purchases instead. This can be a great way to take advantage of savings without necessarily being locked into a contract. Retail offers may not provide as much of a deal as traditional trade-in offers from carriers, though, so keep that in mind as you shop and more offers come online.*All information about the Apple Card has been collected independently by CNET and has not been reviewed by the issuer.
