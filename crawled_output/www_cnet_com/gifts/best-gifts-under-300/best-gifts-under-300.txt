Soundcore by Anker Boom 2 Plus I consider the smaller Boom 2 the best value among current Soundcore by Anker Bluetooth speakers because it delivers very strong sound for a speaker that costs a little more than $100. But the larger and more expensive Boom 2 Plus is a better-sounding speaker that plays louder and produces a bigger sound with more bass. While it costs around $250, the key thing about it is that it competes well with boom box speakers from JBL and Sony which cost upwards of $400.This speaker has dual 50-watt woofers and dual 20-watt tweeters, Anker says, and charges via USB-C, which is nice. There is also a charge-out option to charge your devices and the Boom 2 Plus is rated for up to 20 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels. The speaker has both a handle and removable strap to make it easy to carry around and is IPX7 waterproof. It also floats should you drop it in a body of water and has a customizable light show option. Full Review.

Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 The problem with bone-conduction headphones has always been that they just don't sound all that good. That is unless you plug up your ears, which defeats the safety benefit of their open-ear design and is why they're so popular with runners and bikers. Well, that just changed. Shokz has finally cracked the code on bone-conduction sound quality with a novel dual-driver design in its new flagship OpenRun Pro 2 headphones ($180).With the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz has solved the bass deficiency issue by adding a second, more traditional speaker driver that's tasked with firing bass frequencies toward your open ears. Shokz employed that same micro-speaker technology (it calls it "air conduction") in its first non-bone-conduction headphones, the OpenFit ($140) and Open Fit Air ($120) true-wireless earbuds. Read our Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 review.

Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) Apple's AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. They offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro. Despite their relatively high price, they're easy to recommend to Apple users. Apple rarely offers direct discounts on its own products, many retailers offer discounts on the AirPods Pro 2 throughout the holiday season. Read our Apple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) review.

Bose SoundLink Flex (Currently out of stock) When it launched, Bose made some bold claims about its new SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker, particularly its bass performance. But it mostly lives up to the hype and arguably is the best-sounding wireless speaker for its compact size. Available in three colors -- black, white smoke and stone blue (pictured) -- it's equipped with Bose's PositionIQ technology to automatically detect the speaker's orientation and deliver optimized sound based on whether it's upright, hanging or flat on its back. Read our Bose SoundLink Flex review.

Sony WF-1000XM5 When Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds came out in 2021, they netted a CNET Editors' Choice award. And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it designed its next-generation WF-1000XM5 earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound quality and voice calling. There's no "find my" feature built into the app, overall, they're really impressive, and easily among the top earbuds on the market. Read our Sony WF-1000XM5 review.

Ultimate Ears Everboom Not too long ago, Ultimate Ears released its higher-end Epicboom Bluetooth speaker, which sounds very good but is pretty pricey at $300 and somewhat large. The newer Everboom is about half the size, weighing in at 2.1 pounds (the Epicboom weighs 4.36 pounds) and more travel-friendly. It can't produce as much sound or bass as the Epicboom, but it does play relatively loud, and I was in some ways more impressed with its sound than the Epicboom's. By that I mean for its size, it's one of the best-sounding speakers, delivering punchy bass and nicely detailed sound.Fully waterproof (it floats) and dust-proof with an IP67 rating, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels and can be wirelessly linked up with most of UE's current family of Boom Bluetooth speakers, which includes the Boom 4, Megaboom 4, Epicboom and Hyperboom. Alas, the only strike against it is its relatively high price tag ($250).

JBL Charge 5 Wi-Fi JBL's original Charge 5 Bluetooth speaker comes in multiple color options, but the portable speaker is also available in a version that features both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity that links up with JBL's other Wi-Fi speakers in your home and is both Chromecast- and Apple AirPlay-enabled. It currently only comes in black and is a little more expensive than the Bluetooth-only version. But the dual wireless connectivity options offer a little more versatility, and streaming music over Wi-Fi instead of Bluetooth can help get you slightly better sound quality.The Charge 5 Wi-Fi is bigger than your average portable Bluetooth speaker, but it's got some good kick to it. Like previous Charge speakers, it has a USB out port that allows you to charge a device like a smartphone. Battery life is rated at up to 20 hours at moderate volume levels. It's fully waterproof and dust-proof.

Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro If you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro (read our full review). Yes, the noise cancellation might be a touch better, but the earbuds' excellent sound quality is clearly a step up from that of the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. Read our Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.

Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Solo Stove fire pits are among the best smokeless fire pits, and while they work great and their stainless steel construction gives them a sleek appearance, the original models had one flaw: They weren't so easy to clean up. That changed with the newer Solo Stove 2.0 fire pits, which are available in the same three sizes -- Ranger 2.0 (small), Bonfire 2.0 (medium) and Yukon 2.0 (large) -- and have a removable ash pan, a feature missing from the 1.0 models.

Plufl Billed as the human dog bed, the Plufl has been getting a lot of play on TikTok and other social media channels, so we decided to try one. The "bed" actually comes in four pieces: the cover, two fairly long tube-like pillows and a slim, oval "mattress" made out of memory foam. You stuff everything inside the cover -- assembly takes about 15 minutes -- and lo and behold, you're looking at a giant dog bed (or a plush life raft that doesn't float) big enough for a human. Not only is it quite comfortable for homo sapiens, but our family canine immediately sought refuge in this much larger, roomier version of his bed. The Plufl is slightly more suitable for small or average-size humans, but as long as you aren't really tall, it should accommodate you. It comes in a few colors, and the cover is removable and washable.

Beast Mini Blender Plus There are a lot of mini blenders, but the Beast is one of the best we've tried and it's also attractively designed. Equipped with a 600-watt motor, it's more capable and powerful than many mini blenders. You can buy just the blender for $100, but this Mini Plus model comes with a couple of extra "vessels," which is a fancy way of saying containers, so you can easily go from blending to drinking your smoothie concoctions (and taking them to go). The blender is available in a few different color options. It's also worth noting that Beast makes a slightly bigger blender simply called the Beast Blender that costs $165.

JBL Horizon 2 The clock radio once held a prominent spot on bedside tables around the world. No longer -- but companies still make them, and they've evolved. Case in point: JBL's Horizon 2 Bluetooth clock radio speaker. Not only is it an FM radio with a digital clock (yes, there's an alarm and a snooze button), but it's also a compact Bluetooth speaker that lets you stream tunes from your phone or tablet. Additionally, it has two USB ports for charging devices -- you provide the cables -- and there's an ambient light on the back.The speaker uses a power cord, but a button-cell battery provides backup power for the clock in the event of a power outage. The Horizon 2 comes in black or gray (pictured).

Ember temperature-controlled smart mug (14 ounces) Ember's temperature-controlled smart mugs have been rising in price over the last couple of years, most likely due to supply chain issues, but they now come in more colors, including some eye-catching metallics that cost a little more than standard black, white or blue mugs.Ember makes 6-ounce, 10-ounce, and 14-ounce smart mugs that keep your beverage of choice hot while you sip it. While it won't keep your coffee or tea warm for hours, the idea is that you can select your ideal temp via the companion Ember app for iOS or Android and keep your beverage at a high temp during the 30 minutes or so it takes to casually drink it.I prefer the larger 14-ounce version, though it does cost more. A good insulated mug with a top will also keep your beverage hot (and would be cheaper), but the Ember allows you to drink a cup of joe like you normally would, not through a small hole in the top.

Cuisinart Pure Indulgence No matter what anyone says, homemade ice cream is the best ice cream. CNET's David Watsky spent more than 25 hours testing eight industry-leading ice cream makers, and Cuisinart's Pure Indulgence model came out on top. "This model made the best sorbet and non-dairy vegan ice cream of the bunch, presumably because the double-insulated hull helped it turn custard into dense ice cream faster," he says.

Theragun Mini 2.0 The original Theragun Mini was already a compact massage gun, and the second-gen version, released in 2022, is 20% smaller and 30% lighter, weighing only a pound. It easily fits in a backpack or purse and is great for travel. What's also new to this 2.0 model is USB-C charging, Bluetooth connectivity to the Therabody app on your iOS or Android device, and the inclusion of three foam attachments, instead of just one -- the Standard Ball, the Thumb and Dampener. While the three-speed Mini 2.0 doesn't have quite the power of one of Theragun's full-size devices, it's surprisingly powerful considering its size -- I've tried larger massage guns in this price range, and it's just as powerful. The rechargeable battery is rated to last two hours at the lowest speed setting, and a neoprene protective case is included. The Theragun Mini 2.0 comes in three colors: black, white and desert rose.

Oura Ring 3 Oura recently came out with the Oura 4, but the Oura Ring Gen 3, which costs at least $50 less, offers largely the same features as the newer version, and it's still one of our favorite fitness trackers, thanks to its sleek, modern design and insightful health tracking. Keep in mind that to turn the ring into more than a basic tracker, your giftee will need to pay $6 per month for an Oura membership.

Apple Watch SE (2022) If you want the latest and greatest Apple Watch, you should get the Watch Series 10 or the top-end Watch Ultra 2, but the SE remains the best value. You can also get it with LTE cellular service. It doesn't have some of the extra features of the Apple Watch 10, but the SE offers good performance for those who don't want to spend as much on an Apple Watch. It's available in two sizes; 40mm and 44mm. Read our Apple Watch SE (2022) review.

Roll Recovery R8 Plus Over the last few years, foam rollers and massage guns have become popular recovery products after workouts, as well as important tools for stretching and warming your muscles pre-workout. The original Roll Recovery R8 and newer R8 Plus are somewhat of a combo between a roller and an unpowered massager. The key addition to the R8 Plus is a dial that allows you to adjust the amount of tension to more or less intense levels. You clamp it onto various body parts, with instructional videos showing you how to hit areas such as your calves, hamstrings, IT bands and arms. The R8 Plus is available in white, red or black.

Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige Available in three color options, the Sonicare 9900 Prestige is Philips top-of-the-line electronic toothbrush, carrying a list price of $380, though it usually sells for closer to $300. Why would you want to spend $300 on toothbrush? Well because you care a lot about your teeth. With the Sonicare 9900, you don't exactly "brush" your teeth. You lightly run the vibrating head over your teeth, following the guidance of the Sonicare app for iOS and Android that tells you what spots you missed and where you need to spend more time. It does encourage you to clean your teeth longer and with more care, hitting certain areas that traditional toothbrushes don't clean that well. It's feels like a huge upgrade from using a basic toothbrush. In our tests, using the 9900 daily helped cut down on plaque build up. The Sonicare 9900 charges wirelessly, and a wireless charging dock is included along with a traveling case that charges via USB-C. Replacement heads cost around $13 each (they come in a pack of two or four). While this is the top model in Philips' Sonicare line, it also makes several step-down models, including the Sonicare 9300, which costs $100 less. The 9900 has one additional cleaning mode and features SenseIQ technology that adapts to your brushing style. It has has a swankier travel charging case. Otherwise, they appear to be quite similar.

Oboz Cottonwood Mid Oboz makes a variety of hiking boots and walking shoes, along with a bunch of other footwear. The Cottonwood, which comes in mid and low versions in three color options (it's available for men and women), is a very comfortable hiking boot that's waterproof and can be used for everyday wear whether you live in an urban, suburban or rural setting. The mid version I tried offered good support and I appreciated the O-Fit insole, which is as good as many off-the-shelf orthotic insoles sold online. The shoe fit true to size and really didn't require any breaking in. It's also worth mentioning that it's mostly made out of recycled materials.

Logitech Casa Pop-Up Desk Available in three options, Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk is sort of the ultimate remote work accessory for laptops in that it combines a laptop stand with a low-profile keyboard and touchpad that you store inside the stand, which collapses into a textbook-sized book. The whole thing has a bit of heft to it (the stand is sleek and sturdy) and weighs more than some laptops at a little over 3 pounds. It's a nice portable setup, and both the Casa Keyboard and Casa Touch are solid performers. It is more mid-range than premium (there's no backlight, for example), and neither is quite up to the level of Logitech's Master Series of keyboards and mice, but I had little to complain about. Both have rechargeable batteries, shortcut keys such as Media Keys, Mic Mute and Emoji, and are compatible with the company's Logi Options Plus software.

Reliefband The Reliefband is designed to help people who suffer from motion sickness. It's available in a few different versions, and the company behind the product says each model "gently stimulates" the underside of your wrist with an electrical pulse. The technology is also cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. You do have to apply conductive gel to your wrist before you put on the Reliefband (a small tube is included), and some models allow you to wear the Reliefband and an Apple Watch at the same time with an optional band. You can also adjust the intensity settings.I've used Reliefband on a couple of fishing trips, and it did work for me (I don't get terrible motion sickness, but I do typically get a little). The entry-level Reliefband 50 hours ($100) and Reliefband Flex ($180) have nonrechargeable batteries, while the Sport ($250) and Premier ($280) feature rechargeable ones.

Sena R2 Evo Sena's smart bike helmets are a little heavier than your typical bike helmets, but they feature built-in speakers and a microphone, along with integrated Bluetooth communications. An intercom feature allows you to communicate with other riders in your group wearing compatible Sena helmets as if you're using walkie-talkies. There's also an LED taillight, and you can listen to music, make calls and hear GPS directions when you pair the helmet with your smartphone. If you are buying multiple helmets for your family or riding group, note that the step-up R2 Evo uses mesh communication for its intercom protocol, while the standard R2 uses long-range Bluetooth. Check the intercom interoperability before getting two different models.

Braun Series 7
Most guys secretly want an electric razor, even if they've never used one. The Braun Series 7 isn't the top-of-the-line Braun -- the Series 9 is -- but it's a good value at around $145 for the base kit. It can be used dry or wet -- it's fully waterproof -- and it comes with beard trimmers, a cleaning dock and a carrying case. Battery life is rated at up to 50 minutes on a full charge, and a quick five-minute charge will get you enough juice for a shave.
$150 at Amazon
$133 at Walmart
