Scammers Are Using Ton to Steal on Telegram
#telegram

Scammers have found a new hunting ground inside Telegram and they’re using The Open Network (TON) to pull it off. What started as Telegram’s ambitious blockchain project, created by the Durov brothers, has now grown into a community-led network deeply tied to the messaging app itself. That same integration, however, is what makes TON both powerful — and ripe for abuse.
With Telegram boasting over 1 billion monthly active users, TON aims to bring decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and mini apps to the masses, making crypto as simple as sending a message. Toncoin ($TON), its native cryptocurrency, has surged in value, hitting all-time highs and drawing institutional interest from platforms like Gemini.
But beneath this veneer of innovation lies a troubling reality: TON's seamless integration with Telegram has inadvertently created a fertile breeding ground for scams.
The platform's anonymity, bot ecosystem, and low barriers to entry have empowered fraudsters to target millions, siphoning billions in crypto through phishing, pyramid schemes, and fake investment ops.

As TON's total value locked (TVL) exploded 4,500% in 2024, so did the scams, thereby turning what was meant to democratize finance into a scammer's paradise.
This article dives into how $TON empowers these schemes, the mechanics behind them, and practical steps to stay safe.
The Rise of $TON
TON's appeal is undeniable. Built for speed and scalability, it powers Telegram mini apps, lightweight games, wallets, and tools that run directly in chats.
Users can buy, sell, and trade $TON without leaving the app, using features like wallet integration and anonymous numbers via platforms like Fragment. This "crypto in every pocket" vision has onboarded 38 million active accounts, with TON's market cap ballooning to billions.
Yet, this accessibility cuts both ways. Telegram's end-to-end encryption, optional phone number hiding, and open API allow scammers to operate with near impunity. Features like group chats (up to 200,000 members) and bots enable mass outreach, while TON's low transaction fees make it cheap to launder or move stolen funds.
As one cybersecurity expert noted, "The Telegram ecosystem is too free," with phishing links spreading unchecked through groups and airdrops. In 2024 alone, TON-related scams have drained wallets via malicious contracts, with reports of $35 billion in illicit transactions tied to Telegram-based black markets for scam services.
The result? A honeypot for fraud. As TON gains legitimacy, recently listed on major exchanges, scammers exploit the hype, preying on newcomers lured by promises of easy gains.
Key Ways TON Empowers Scams on Telegram
TON's toolkit bots, wallets, and referrals have supercharged traditional Telegram scams, blending them with crypto's irreversibility. Here's how fraudsters leverage it:
1. Pyramid Referral Schemes: The "Exclusive Earning Program" Trap
One of the most insidious TON scams mimics legitimate referral programs but twists them into pyramids. Operating since November 2023, these schemes have targeted global users, promising "insider" Toncoin earnings.
How it Works: Victims receive a link from a "friend" inviting them to an "exclusive earning program." They join an unofficial Telegram bot (disguised as a crypto storage tool) and link their Web3 wallet. Scammers instruct buying TON via legit channels—like the official Telegram Wallet or exchanges to build trust. Next, users are upsold "boosters" (e.g., "bike" for 5 TON at 30% commission, "rocket" for 500 TON at 70%) via another bot, supposedly to unlock earnings. Once paid, funds vanish, and it becomes clear the bot is scammer-controlled.
Referral Twist: To "withdraw," victims must recruit five friends, creating private Telegram groups and sharing pre-recorded videos with referral links. This virality exploits Telegram's social graph, turning users into unwitting promoters.
Scale and Impact: Kaspersky reported this scam hitting users worldwide, with TON's 900 million Telegram users as prime targets. Losses are irreversible due to blockchain's nature, and the scheme's credibility (using real TON purchases) fools even savvy investors.

2. Phishing Bots and Malicious Mini Apps
TON's bot ecosystem, a cornerstone of its mini apps, is a scammer's dream. Bots handle everything from games to trades, but fakes mimic official ones to steal credentials.
How it Works: Scammers flood groups with phishing links or bots posing as "TON Giveaway" or "Wallet Support." Users enter Telegram usernames or connect wallets for "free tokens," triggering malicious contracts that drain funds. One variant, "Telegram Giveaway TON," promises airdrops but siphons crypto to scammer addresses. Anonymous numbers (blockchain-based logins without SIM cards) exacerbate this, letting fraudsters create throwaway accounts.
TON's Role: Mini apps like Notcoin (a hit TON game) inspired copycats that require "fees" in TON for rewards that never come. SlowMist warned of a phishing surge in mid-2024, with TVL growth correlating to attacks—scammers post links in open groups, luring batch thefts.
Real World Hit: In 2025, fake Fragment clones targeted username auctions, tricking users into sending TON for "bids" that go nowhere.
3. Pump and Dump and Fake Investment Groups
Telegram's channels (broadcast to thousands) amplify TON's volatility for pumps.
How it Works: Scammers create fake channels mimicking legit projects (e.g., "TON Insider"), hyping low-cap tokens with "guaranteed returns." Users buy in via TON, inflating prices; scammers dump, crashing values. Bots generate fake engagement to build FOMO.
TON Empowerment: Native wallet integration means seamless transfers—victims send TON directly, no KYC needed. Romance scams evolve too: Fraudsters build trust, then pitch "TON investments," extracting funds.
Stats: Crypto scams on Telegram hit billions annually, with TON-specific ones spiking post Telegram's TON endorsement.
4. Black Markets and Laundering Hubs
TON's speed aids post scam cleanup. Chinese language markets like Haowang Guarantee (banned in 2025 but reborn as Tudou Guarantee) sold $35 billion in scam tools, laundering, and data theft, much via TON. These rebound quickly, as Telegram's lax moderation allows rebranding.
The Human Cost: Victims Speak Out
On X (formerly Twitter), frustration boils over. Users decry TON as a "mafia setup" and "empty black hole" for money laundering, with posts like: "I lost 50% in Telegram’s Web3... pure scam.
“Mini apps, NFT gifts, stickers, all trash."
“Others warn of fake airdrops stealing Telegram Stars and TON, calling projects like BoinkersIO "scam[s] aiming to steal... from users." One user lamented: "Half of Telegram’s 1 billion users have gone inactive after being tricked by scam mining projects."
These aren't isolated rants. Elliptic's 2025 report shows scam markets rebuilding post-bans, enabling billions in fraud from Southeast Asian compounds.
How to Protect Yourself: Essential Safeguards
TON's creators emphasize safety, but users must act. Here's a quick guide:
Tip
Why It Works
How to Implement
Verify Sources
Scams mimic officials-always cross-check.
Stick to verified Telegram channels/X profiles. Use TON's official blog for updates.
Enable 2FA Everywhere
Blocks unauthorized access.
Turn on two-factor authentication in Telegram and wallets. Avoid anonymous numbers for high-value accounts.
Never Share Seeds/Keys
Irreversible theft otherwise.
Legit projects never ask for private keys. Use hardware wallets for big holdings.
Research Referrals
Pyramids prey on trust.
If a "friend" shares a link, verify independently. Report suspicious bots via @notoscam.
Spot Red Flags
Urgency, guarantees, upfront fees scream scam.
Pause on FOMO—DYOR via community forums. Use tools like SlowMist for phishing alerts.
Report Aggressively
Slows scammers down.
Flag in-app; contact Telegram support. For crypto losses, trace via explorers like Tonscan.
TON's blog advises: "If something feels off, ask the community!" And remember, no real giveaway requires sending crypto first.
Conclusion
TON's Telegram symbiosis is revolutionary, potentially onboarding billions to Web3. But without stronger guardrails, like enhanced bot verification or AI scam detection, it risks becoming synonymous with fraud.
As Pavel Durov's vision clashes with reality, the onus falls on users, developers, and regulators to curb the abuse. Stay vigilant: In crypto, empowerment cuts both ways. If TON can tame its wild side, it might just fulfill its promise. Until then, trade wisely or risk joining the scammed.
