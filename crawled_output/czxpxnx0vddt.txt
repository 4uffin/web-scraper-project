That victory means England surpassed their own record for a winning streak across both men's and women's international rugby union (30), which was ended by New Zealand at the World Cup final in 2022.Defeat by the Black Ferns in that match is England's only loss in their past 62 matches.Jess Breach, who won her 51st cap, has never lost playing for England.Replacement flanker Maddie Feaunati is another one.Some stat!

That semi-final match-up - I cannot wait. That game is going to be good.We talk about entertaining fans - we want to get more people coming to the games to watch and support them, not just at this World Cup but after it as well.

We just need to make sure France turn up. We want a spectacle of a semi-final.If we get the France that finished that Six Nations game that was 43-42, we're going to be in for a really great game of rugby.

I don't think that was the best France can perform. Even in that second half, I still think they can go another level.That Six Nations game when England nearly lost was one of the best games I've seen in a while, so I hope it turns up again.

Scotland head coach Bryan Easson, speaking to BBC Sport: "I think what we said we wanted to do, [reach a quarter final] we have done. You don't win quarter-finals the first time. This has to be something that isn't the end but the start of something. "We have shown everyone the talent we have."On contracts: "I think when you look at the players out there everyone deserves something to move forward."

The progress this team has made, this has taken eight to 10 years for this core group of players to come through, so we don't want is to lose that progress.15 players have retained their contracts, the rest have either got some kind of hybrid contract or have lost their contracts completely.The timing of the communication was not a good way to go into a World Cup, it's not want you want to prepare your players going into a massive tournament like this.What I'd want to see from the SRU (Scottish Rugby Union) is good conversations with their players about next steps. I know they want to grow the game in Scotland, that's what we all want, but not to the detriment of our women's team.Image source, Getty Images

Bryan and I have worked really close throughout my captaincy."

What I loved about Scotland today is they forced England to have to learn from those last couple of weeks.England had been having not the greatest starts and we knew that coming into it.The likes of Meg Jones and Tatyana Heard said 'that's not happening today' and I think that really did throw Scotland.This game was actually perfect for England, it gave them confidence, all their big players got to come back. I congratulate Scotland for not making it easy, but also I have to give it up to the Red Roses for learning from their pool games and players stepping up in big play-off moments.

I'm so proud [of the Scotland team]. When I saw the girls tearing up I was getting so emotional.It means so much to them, the first time in the quarter-final in 23 years, they deserve to be on this stage and playing against the best teams in the world.England are the number one and it was difficult for them today, they did get suffocated at times, but I'm proud of the efforts they put in, the fight until the final minute and they never gave up. They emptied the tank today.

That's Bryan Easson's final game as head coach of Scotland.Scotland's World Cup run to a first quarter-final since 2002 comes only months after it was revealed some players were continuing to "suffer with their mental and emotional health following the potential loss of their contracts".

What a way to end this tournament for Scotland. The full team are in there to celebrate, and Rhona Lloyd is in tears as she emerges from the dark blue shirts.It's hard not to get emotional watching that.Although it's not been enough today, they've put everything into the last few weeks and months - despite everything put in their way.

It was brilliant [from England]. There's not much more you can say about it.In terms of other games England have played so far at the World Cup, they haven't had the perfect 80 minutes. I do feel against Scotland they stood up, made a statement and every player had a really good game.There are still areas to work on but England will be very pleased with the way they conducted themselves today.
