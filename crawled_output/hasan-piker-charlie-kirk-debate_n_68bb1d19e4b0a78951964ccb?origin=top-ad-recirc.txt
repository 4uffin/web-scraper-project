Piker said he was live-streaming when he learned about Kirk’s gruesome killing on Wednesday and was “shocked” by what he saw.“It was the horror of seeing someone whom I know — not a friend or an ally, but a human being I know personally and have debated before — fall victim to what clearly seems to be a rising tide of political violence,” he wrote.Hasan Piker wrote about the shock and "horror" he felt learning about Charlie Kirk's killing.Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Politicon)Advertisement
As of Saturday, the motives of Kirk’s killer were unclear. Shell casings from the weapon used to shoot Kirk were covered in messages that appeared to reference internet meme culture and video games.In the op-ed, Piker reflected on the factors he sees as contributing to the killing of Kirk, expressing his wish to debate these things with Kirk himself.“I would have liked to ask Mr. Kirk about all these things,” he said, noting that the two “identified some of the same problems,” though they “clashed” on causes and solutions.Advertisement

“Over time, our culture of violence has targeted people around the world — anywhere from Cuba to Iraq — people who serve as literal targets for American weapons and bombs, absorbing what I think of as Americans’ excess capacity for violence,” he wrote.He later continued, “A foreign policy organized around punishing and killing our supposedly sworn enemies, diplomacy be damned, conveys the terrible message that we can only kill and maim our way to achieving the world we want to live in.”PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
