Frequently asked questionsAre the degrees hosted on Coursera from accredited universities? Yes, all online degree programs available on Coursera are directly conferred by accredited institutions. Accreditation is important because it shows that an institution meets rigorous academic standards, eases your ability to transfer credits, and helps employers validate the quality of education on your resume or application.Can I transfer previously earned college credits?That depends on the degree youâre interested in earning. Many of the bachelorâs degrees on Coursera from US-based institutions, such as Georgetown Universityâs Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies, allow students to transfer some previously earned college credits. Some, like the University of North Texasâ Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences and Bachelor of Science in General Business, are degree completion programs and require transfer credits in order to enroll. Each university determines the number of pre-approved transfer credits that may count towards the degree requirements according to institutional policies. Check with each degree program for more information. You can also build credit toward an online degree program by first enrolling in university pre-approved courses, specializations, and certificates on Coursera. If you decide to apply and are admitted, the courses youâve completed may count toward your degree requirements.
Can I take online degree courses from anywhere in the world?Yes, all you need is a reliable internet connection. No matter where you are in the world, you can enroll in the degree programs that Courseraâs university partners offer, though there may be specific application requirements based on your status as a domestic or international student.How long do degrees take to finish?Degree programs on Coursera are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing you to study part-time or full-time based on your schedule.Undergraduate degrees typically take between two and six years to complete. Your timeline depends on factors like how many transfer credits you bring and the programâs structure. For example, BITS Pilani suggests about 25 hours of study per week, while the University of London recommends around 28 hours weekly.Graduate degrees generally require one to three years, depending on your pace and program requirements.What are the application deadlines?College application deadlines, for both bachelorâs degrees and masterâs degrees, tend to occur just once a year. However, on Coursera, youâll find greater flexibility from universities. Deadlines tend to occur around three times a yearâonce in the fall, once in the spring, and once in the summerâdepending on the institution. Some degree programs, like the University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science, don't require an application for admission. Instead, you can qualify for performance-based admission by passing three online courses pre-approved by the university with an 80% grade or higher.What is the online degree experience like on Coursera? Earning your degree from a leading university on Coursera means experiencing greater flexibility than in-person degree programs, so you can earn the best degree for your needs without having to relocate or choose between your other responsibilities. You can take your online courses from anywhere in the world, at a pace that works for you. Once enrolled in your program, you may find a range of learning options, including live video lectures that encourage you to collaborate and self-paced courses that give you greater independence. Moreover, throughout your learning journey, you'll have access to a dedicated support team, course facilitators, and a network of peers to help you achieve your academic goals. Learn more about the benefits of learning online.Does Coursera offer scholarships or tuition assistance? Where can I find information about them?You cannot apply for a scholarship or tuition assistance directly from Coursera. However, many university partners offer an opportunity to apply for financial support directly. Check with each degree program for more information. You can find information on external scholarships and other resources to help fund your degree on Courseraâs Financial Resources Hub.Is an online degree worth it?Education is a valuable tool you can use to achieve some goals: pivot to a new field, progress in your career, or learn about a subject in more depth. Online degree programs on Coursera come from accredited university partners and typically offer the same curriculum as their in-person degree programs. Deciding whether an online degree is worth it is ultimately up to you. Consider your overall goals, whether the subject matter in a degree program aligns with your needs, the types of skills youâd like to develop, and how you learn best. These are just some of the factors worth reflecting on as you set about reviewing different degree programs on Coursera. Learn more about whether a bachelorâs degree is worth it and whether a masterâs degree is worth it.Show all 8 frequently asked questionsMore QuestionsVisit the learner help centerCoursera FooterTechnical SkillsChatGPTCodingComputer ScienceCybersecurityDevOpsEthical HackingGenerative AIJava ProgrammingPythonWeb DevelopmentAnalytical SkillsArtificial IntelligenceBig DataBusiness AnalysisData AnalyticsData ScienceFinancial ModelingMachine LearningMicrosoft ExcelMicrosoft Power BISQLBusiness SkillsAccountingDigital MarketingE-commerceFinanceGoogleGraphic DesignIBMMarketingProject ManagementSocial Media MarketingCareer ResourcesEssential IT CertificationsHigh-Income Skills to LearnHow to Get a PMP CertificationHow to Learn Artificial IntelligencePopular Cybersecurity CertificationsPopular Data Analytics CertificationsWhat Does a Data Analyst Do?Career Development ResourcesCareer Aptitude TestShare your Coursera Learning StoryCourseraAboutWhat We OfferLeadershipCareersCatalogCoursera PlusProfessional CertificatesMasterTrackÂ® CertificatesDegreesFor EnterpriseFor GovernmentFor CampusBecome a PartnerSocial ImpactFree CoursesECTS Credit RecommendationsCommunityLearnersPartnersBeta TestersBlogThe Coursera PodcastTech BlogMorePressInvestorsTermsPrivacyHelpAccessibilityContactArticlesDirectoryAffiliatesModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell/ShareLearn AnywhereÂ© 2025 Coursera Inc.
