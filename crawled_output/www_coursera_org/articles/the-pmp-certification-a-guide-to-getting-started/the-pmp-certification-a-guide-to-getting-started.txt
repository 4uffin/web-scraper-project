It can be renewed or maintained by earning 60 hours (also referred to as professional development units) during that time frame on professional development activities to maintain it. Otherwise, you'll need to sign up to take the exam again.PMP prep course costsSome courses can cost several hundred or even a few thousand dollars to complete. However, they may be a worthwhile investment if you're looking for a structured way to ensure youâre fully prepared for the test. If you think earning the PMP certification also benefits your employer, consider approaching your manager to see if they can cover exam or exam prep costs. Whatâs on the PMP exam?The PMP exam entails answering 180 questions. These include multiple choice, matching, hotspot, and limited fill-in-the-blank questions. Over the course of the three hours and 50 minutes (230 minutes total) that you have to complete the exam, you'll get two 10-minute breaks.
Roughly half of the content represents predictive project management approaches, while the other half represents Agile or hybrid approaches. The questions fall into three domains that span process, people, and business environment:Process: 50 percentThe process section tests your knowledge of the methodology for completing a project. You might be asked about managing budgets and other resources, scheduling, handling project changes, and determining the best methodologies for the project.People: 42 percentThe people section, which makes up slightly less than half of the exam, includes questions on leading and building teams, managing conflict, supporting virtual teams, mentoring, and related topics.Business environment: 8 percentThe business environment portion of the exam deals broadly with the more business-minded aspects youâll have to tackle as a project manager, like compliance, delivering value, and supporting organizational change.How to get PMP certificationHereâs a step-by-step guide to getting your PMP certification:1. Meet the PMP certification requirements.Â Before you can take the PMP exam, youâll have to make sure youâre eligible for one of the sets. Keep track of your work and training, recording information like your specific role, responsibilities, and length of projects or professional development, so that you have it at hand when you apply. You can work toward the 35-hour requirement by achieving CAPM certification (designed for project management professionals with three years of experience or less) or by completing the Google Project Management Professional Certificate program. Both can help fulfill portions of that requirement.2. Apply.Make an account using the PMI website to get started on your application for the PMP exam. This will entail sharing basic personal information like your educational background, as well as details about the projects youâve worked on.Â Once youâre approved, youâll pay the exam fee and schedule a test.3. Study for the exam.Studying for the exam will take some planning, prioritization, and dedication. You can train for this exam either through structured coursework or on your own. Generally, exam prep providers recommend spending 60 to 120 hours studying. A survey by PM Exam Lessons Learned found that successful exam takers dedicated two to six months to practice. Depending on how frequently you study, this can take several months. Consider taking practice exams and studying PMI resources to prepare. The PMP certification is not an entry-level exam. It can be challenging, even for experienced project managers. It requires a strong knowledge of the Project Management Body of Knowledge and the ability to think critically to apply these guidelines and other industry-standard practices to a variety of workplace situations. 4.
