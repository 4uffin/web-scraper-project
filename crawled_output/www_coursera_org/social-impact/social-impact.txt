I recently changed roles in my company and can honestly say that this course impacted my approach to my new role. Although Iâm retired from a 30-year military career and am 50-plus years of age, I never, ever want to stop learning, growing, and challenging myself. Education plays a central role in my professional future, without question.Timothy HornUnited Service Organizations (USO)Our global Social Impact ProgramCoursera has worked with global nonprofit organizations to offer learners in need access to free, high-quality education that supports their personal development, career advancement, and economic opportunity.
