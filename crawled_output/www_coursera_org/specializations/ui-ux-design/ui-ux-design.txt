Visual Elements of User Interface DesignCourse 1â¢19 hoursCourse detailsWhat you'll learnThis design-centric course examines the broad question of what an interface is and what role a designer plays in creating a user interface. Learning how to design and articulate meaning using color, type, and imagery is essential to making interfaces function clearly and seamlessly. Through a series of lectures and visual exercises, you will focus on the many individual elements and components that make up the skillset of an interface designer. By the end of this course, you will be able to describe the key formal elements of clear, consistent, and intuitive UI design, and apply your learned skills to the design of a static screen-based interface.This is the first course in the UI/UX Design Specialization, which brings a design-centric approach to user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, and offers practical, skill-based instruction centered around a visual communications perspective, rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone.
These courses are ideal for anyone with some experience in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their skill set in UI or UX for app and web design. It would also be ideal for anyone with experience in front- or back-end web development or human-computer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis skills for UI or UX.Skills you'll gainCategory: User Interface (UI) DesignUser Interface (UI) DesignCategory: Responsive Web DesignResponsive Web DesignCategory: UI ComponentsUI ComponentsCategory: Interaction DesignInteraction DesignCategory: Design Elements And PrinciplesDesign Elements And PrinciplesCategory: Graphic and Visual DesignGraphic and Visual DesignCategory: Information ArchitectureInformation ArchitectureCategory: User Experience DesignUser Experience DesignCategory: Web DesignWeb DesignCategory: Human Computer InteractionHuman Computer InteractionCategory: TypographyTypographyCategory: Graphic DesignGraphic DesignUX Design FundamentalsCourse 2â¢16 hoursCourse detailsWhat you'll learnThis hands-on course examines how content is organized and structured to create an experience for a user, and what role the designer plays in creating and shaping user experience. You will be led through a condensed process that acts as a roadmap for developing robust UI/UX design: from ideation and sitemapping, to the creation of paper and digital prototypes. Building on the design skills learned in Visual Elements of User Interface Design, you will apply this methodology to produce a digital prototype for a multi-screen app of your own invention.By the end of this course, you will be able to describe and apply current best practices and conventions in UX design, and employ the fundamental principles of how UX design functions to shape an audience's experience of a given body of content.

While the concepts covered will translate to many kinds of interactive media (apps, digital kiosks, games), our primary focus will be on designing contemporary, responsive websites. In this course you will complete the first half of a large scale projectâdeveloping a comprehensive plan for a complex websiteâby defining the strategy and scope of the site, as well as developing its information architecture and overall structure. Along the way we will also discuss:- Different job descriptions in the web design industry and where UX and UI skills fall within this spectrum
- The difference between native apps and websites
- The difference of agile vs. waterfall approaches
- User personas and site personas
- User testing
The work and knowledge in this course continues in the last course in the UI/UX Design Specialization, Web Design: Wireframes to Prototypes, where you will tackleâfinallyâwireframes, visual mockups, and clickable prototypes.

Along the way we will also discuss:- Responsive web design and mobile web challenges
- Mobile-first approach
- Web typography
- The relationship between design and programming and whether it is important to know how to code
- The different web technologies that make the web work, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side coding, and databases.
This course is the continuation of the course Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture, in which students completed the first half of a large scale projectâdeveloping a comprehensive plan for a complex website. If you are intending to complete the assignments in this course to earn a certificate you must complete the Strategy and Information Architecture course first so you have the materials and data needed to begin creating wireframes and mockups in this course.
