Computers break, systems fail, phones die; and when that happens, we need experts to fix them. IT support is all about troubleshooting and problem solving when the tech fails, and providing great customer service along the way.Why did Google create this program?Google has long faced an issue that many other companies also contend with -- we had open IT Support roles, and not enough qualified candidates to fill them. So, a few years ago we began working with a non-profit organization to build out trainings and pathways to roles in technical support at Google. We learned that not only is IT support a highly teachable field, but that we could teach someone completely new to the industry the IT fundamentals in about 8-12 months. So, we decided to build an IT training program on Coursera, created entirely by Googlers who are expert in IT support, so that this training could be available to everyone.Is financial assistance available?The total cost of this self-paced learning program is just $49 per month. But for a limited time, Google is providing full financial assistance for qualified US residents who need support. To be eligible for financial assistance, you need to apply here (https://www.coursera.org/financial-assistance/google-it-support) by February 20th. After February 20th we will continue to accept applications to be added to our waitlist. We will be actively managing our waitlist, and all those on the waitlist will be alerted as soon as possible regarding their application status.Once approved, youâll have access to all six courses in the certificate program.
