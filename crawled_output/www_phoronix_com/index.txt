Multi-Kernel Architecture Proposed For The Linux Kernel
14 Hours Ago - Linux Kernel - Linux Multi-Kernel Architecture - 35 CommentsCode was open-sourced this week and posted to the Linux kernel mailing list as a "request for comments" (RFC) for a multi-kernel architecture. This proposal could allow for multiple independent kernel instances to co-exist on a single physical machine. Each kernel could run on dedicated CPU Cores while sharing underlying hardware resources. This could also allow for some complex use-cases such as real-time (RT) kernels running on select CPU cores.
