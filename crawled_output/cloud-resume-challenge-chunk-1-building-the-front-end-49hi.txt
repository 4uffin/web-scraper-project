Cloud Resume Challenge - Chunk 1 - Building the Front-End
With my AWS foundation secured in Chunk 0, it was time to bring my actual resume to life. The goal here was simple:
Convert my resume into HTML
Style it with CSS
Add some life with JavaScript animations
Host it on S3 and secure it behind CloudFront
This stage was where things started to feel real, the moment when my work became something I could show off on the internet. 🚀
🎨 Choosing a Theme: Hugo Console
Instead of starting from scratch, I used the Hugo and used a theme called Console.
Why Console?
✅ Minimalist and clean
✅ Looks like a Linux terminal, a fun nod to tech culture
✅ Lightweight with performance in mind (average load time ~55ms!)
The theme gave me a foundation that balanced style and speed, and I customized it with my content.
💡 Pro Tip: If you show your resume online, choose a theme that matches your personality and loads fast. Hiring managers won’t wait 10 seconds for fancy animations to finish.
🪄 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I wrote my resume in HTML, and Hugo takes care of the rest. From there, I built out my resume website and added content pages(home, projects, resume, and contact).
No over-the-top parallax or heavy JS libraries, just smooth transitions that gave it polish without bloating load times.
Example snippet (simple fade-in animation with CSS):
.fade-in {
opacity: 0;
animation: fadeIn ease 2s;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}
@keyframes fadeIn {
0% { opacity: 0; }
100% { opacity: 1; }
}

Exit fullscreen mode
📦 Hosting on Amazon S3
Once my static site was ready, I uploaded it to an S3 bucket.
But here’s the important part:
❌ No public access to the bucket
❌ Bucket policy allowing read-only access
✅ All access through CloudFront
This ensured my resume can only be read from the S3 bucket link, all traffic goes through my CloudFront distribution.
⚠️ Common mistake: Many tutorials tell you to make the bucket public.
That's the quick way, but not secure. Using CloudFront + bucket policies is the professional way.
🛡️ Example S3 Bucket Policy
Here’s a bucket policy that only allows read-only access via CloudFront:
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "AllowCloudFrontAccess",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Principal": {
"Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
},
"Action": "s3:GetObject",
"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-resume-bucket/*",
"Condition": {
"StringEquals": {
"AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFDVBD632BHDS5"
}
}
}
]
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
This means: only my CloudFront distribution can fetch files from S3.
🌍 Configuring CloudFront
Next, I set up a CloudFront distribution to serve the site globally.
Benefits I gained:
⚡ Faster load times (edge caching around the world)
🔐 HTTPS enforced by default
🚫 No direct S3 exposure
With CloudFront in place, my resume site became secure, fast, and production-ready.
🖼️ Iterating with Multiple Themes
Along the way, I tested multiple themes before sticking with Console. Some were more colorful, others more traditional, but I wanted something that screamed developer.
🚀 Lessons Learned in Chunk 1
By the end of this chunk, I achieved:
✅ A functional static site generated with Hugo
✅ A minimalist theme (Console) with blazing fast load times
✅ Hosting via S3 + CloudFront with locked-down permissions
✅ Confidence that my resume was secure and globally available
Most importantly, I learned that setting up a front-end in the cloud isn’t just about making it look good, it’s about building it the right way.
🌟 What’s Next?
Now that my front-end is live and secure, the next step is making it dynamic, connecting it to a backend + database so my resume can track visitors, show unique live stats.
That’s coming in Chunk 2. ⚡
