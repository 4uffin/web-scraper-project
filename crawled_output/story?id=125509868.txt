Meanwhile, a revision of previous hiring estimates on Tuesday revealed the U.S. economy added far fewer jobs in 2024 and early 2025 than previously estimated, deepening concern about the health of the U.S. job market.MORE: Inflation climbed in August as Trump's tariffs intensifiedThe weak jobs data has raised alarm among some analysts that the U.S. economy may be slipping toward a recession, though the economy has largely averted the type of widespread job losses that often accompany a downturn.The economic conditions have put Federal Reserve policymakers in a bind. If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks tipping the economy into a downturn. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.In response to the flagging labor market, the Fed is expected to cut interest rates when policymakers meet next week. Investors peg the chances of a quarter-point rate cut this month at about 92% and the odds of a half-point cut at roughly 7%, according to CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.Related TopicsEconomySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDetails of Charlie Kirk's memorial announcedSep 13, 4:19 PMTrump doubles down on blaming 'radical left' after vow to go after political violenceSep 12, 1:44 PMTrump says he'll send National Guard to 'deeply troubled' MemphisSep 12, 4:09 PMAfter Charlie Kirk's killing, MAGA world mourns, but some say 'we're at war'Sep 12, 2:57 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
