Validate a globed-like path

I am writing a API for a program. The program has a native support of "globed" paths such as img-0*.png. I would like to know how to be sure that there is at least a file satisfying that pattern, a kind of is_globable(path) method.
path = 'img-0*.png'
if os.path.isfile(path):
pass
elif is_globable(path):
pass
else:
raise Exception(...)
Neither glob or pathlib provide such a functionality.
The most related method I found is pathlib.PurePath.full_match but solves the opposite problem.

yes, for example. Even img-0?.png and other combinations. I want to know a way to validate globed-paths

Actually, this can be done using the glob library using glob.glob:
path = 'img-0*.png'
def is_globable(path):
return glob.glob(path)
if os.path.isfile(path):
pass
elif is_globable(path):
pass
else:
raise Exception(...)
Here are the docs:

Why bother calling bool()?
glob.glob() returns a list, and lists already evaluate as "falsey" (an empty list) or "truthy" (a list containing at least one item).

Using the iterator form, glob.iglob.
For sake of completeness I recall its full signature:
glob.iglob(pathname, *, root_dir=None, dir_fd=None, recursive=False, include_hidden=False)
It is based on os.scandir and fnmatch.fnmatch to walk the tree and filter the names.
It also support the
? single character,
* for any characters with 0 or more repetitions and
[] for grouping
in both basename and directories.
Example of path: ./images-*/doc-00[4-7]_?.png
from glob import iglob
def is_globable(path):
return bool(next(iglob(path), False))

This is my solution, it has several features as follows:
✅ Validates all common glob patterns (*, ?, [], {}, **)
✅ Checks for invalid characters and path length
✅ Validates bracket matching and pattern sanity
✅ Supports both Windows and Unix path styles
✅ Detailed error messages
✅ Batch validation support
✅ Performance optimized with caching

I suggest taking look at fnmatch. Note that unlike glob.glob, functions from fnmatch do not scan directory automatically, but this might be advantage if your API is only for reading (no need to repeat scan) or if you wish to restrict files available, simple example
import fnmatch
def has_match(pattern, files):
for file in files:
if fnmatch.fnmatch(file, pattern):
return True
return False
files = ["01.jpg", "02.jpg", "03.jpg"]
has_match("*.jpg", files)
# True
has_match("*.txt", files)
# False
