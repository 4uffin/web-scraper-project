Weâll explain the main parts of a toilet and what they do to make a toilet work. Weâll also give you tips on fixing toilet parts so you can save time and money.Toilet Parts Overview			Whether you have a standard height or chair-height toilet, one with a round seat or an elongated seat, the parts that make your toilet function properly are generally all the same. Taking the time to learn about toilet parts while your toilet is working properly can save you a lot of time and stress and will help you be more prepared if a problem arises. To make things easier, you can split the toilet body into two sections, the toilet tank and the toilet bowl.Toilet Diagram	The toilet diagram above identifies the key toilet bowl and tank parts. Weâll explain them below and give you tips on repairing them yourself. However, these are general tips. Different toilets and parts may have different repair procedures, so always follow the instructions that come with your repair parts. If youâre not comfortable with toilet repair, call a professional.TipIf you think you may have a problem with your toilet but aren't sure what it is, take a look at our list of some of the most common toilet problems and how to fix them. We outline potential causes for several types of leaks below, but you can also learn how to test your toilet for leaks to track down the specific problem.A toilet repair kit will include many of the parts necessary to handle a range of toilet repairs, just make sure the parts in the kit are universal or are designed for your toilet.Shop Toilet Parts & RepairShop ToiletsShop Toilet SeatsToilet Tank Parts			The toilet tank is on the back of the toilet bowl. In a two-piece toilet the tank and bowl are separate, but there are one-piece toilets with the tank and bowl integrated into a single fixture. Here are primary toilet tank parts along with some tips for what to do when key parts inside a toilet tank arenât working correctly.Good to Know
When repairing a toilet, wear splash-proof goggles and cleaning gloves. Have some cleaning cloths handy for spills and drips. Protect the floor in the work area with a thick plastic drop cloth.
Caution
Before making any toilet repairs, turn off the water supply to the toilet. You can do this with the water shut-off valve located on the wall behind the toilet or on the floor next to the toilet.Toilet Tank
The toilet tank itself stores the water the toilet uses to flush. How does a toilet work? Flushing the toilet opens a flapper in the bottom of the tank. Water from the tank drains from the tank into the bowl where it washes away waste. The tank then refills with water. Most of the parts of a toilet that make the flushing action work are in the tank.
Toilet Handle or Lever
The toilet handle or lever is usually on the outside of the toilet tank. The handle includes a flush rod that a lift chain hooks onto. Activating the toilet handle pulls the chain. The chain opens the flapper at the bottom of the tank, releasing a rush of water into the bowl to flush waste from the bowl and into the house drain.
How to Fix a Toilet HandleIf the handle is loose, ensure the retaining nut on the inside of the toilet tank is tight. This is usually a reverse-thread nut, so turn it counterclockwise to tighten it. Donât overtighten the nut.If the handle or flush rod is damaged, replace the assembly with a replacement toilet handle. Disconnect the toilet chain from the rod and unscrew the handle retaining nut. Pull out the handle and rod. Insert the new handle, tighten the retaining nut and reattach the chain. Test the lever to ensure it activates the flush correctly. Get more details on the process with our toilet handle replacement how-to.Good to Know
Some toilets have a set of buttons rather than a lever. The buttons might be on the toilet tank lid. Button flush toilets, or dual flush toilets, offer two flushing options, including a full flush and a water-conserving flush.Toilet Chain or Lift Chain
The toilet chain or lift chain connects the rod on the toilet handle to the flapper. As we describe above, the chain pulls up the flapper from the bottom of the tank, allowing the water in the tank to flush the waste out of the bowl. If the toilet doesnât stop running after a flush or if the flapper isnât lifting correctly, the toilet chain might need adjustment or it could be tangled or broken.
How to Fix a Toilet ChainTurn off the water supply valve. With the supply valve closed, flushing the toilet should lower the water level enough for you to work.Untangle the chain as necessary.Check to see if the chain has disconnected from the flapper or the flush rod. If so, you should be able to reconnect it easily.If the chain is broken, purchase a replacement chain and connect it to the rod and flapper.If the connection point on the flush rod is broken, replace the handle and rod assembly as described above in How to Fix a Toilet Handle.If the connection point on the flapper is broken, replace the flapper using the steps below in How to Fix a Toilet Flapper Valve.Once you complete the fix, test the flush action and adjust the chain position on the flush rod as necessary.Toilet Flapper	The flapper or toilet flapper valve is a stopper that seats into the flush valve mounted to the tank drain hole. Youâll see the toilet flapper at the base of the tank. Itâs connected to the overflow tube on the flush valve, both of which weâll explain below. When the toilet flapper is in place in the flush valve opening and the fill valve opens, the tank fills. When the lift chain raises the flapper, the flushing action begins. If water from the tank is leaking into the bowl or if the toilet flushes on its own â known as phantom flushing â you may need to repair the flapper. In most cases, this means replacing it.How to Fix a Toilet Flapper ValveCheck to see if the flapper has disconnected from the overflow tube. If so, you may be able to simply reconnect it.If you canât reconnect it securely or if itâs connected but leaking, replace the flapper. The replacement will either be a 2-inch flapper or a 3-inch flapper. Measure the flush valve opening to ensure you purchase the correct size. On some toilets, you can simply pop the flapper off a couple of mounting points on the overflow tube and pop the replacement back on. If the flapper is integrated with the overflow tube, youâll need to replace the entire flush valve. Weâll explain that below in How to Fix a Toilet Flush Valve.Toilet Fill ValveEach time you flush the toilet, the toilet fill valve opens to refill the toilet tank so there will be water for the next use. The fill valve also sends water through the overflow tube to refill the toilet bowl. An external or internal toilet float connects to the valve, regulating the level of the water in the tank. If the tank or bowl isnât refilling enough for the next flush, you might need to adjust or replace the fill valve. If the toilet is constantly running but the flapper is in good shape, it can be another indication that you need to fix or replace the fill valve. How to Fix a Toilet Fill ValveLift the float on the fill valve to see if the valve closes fully. If not, you can replace the faulty valve assembly:Turn off the supply valve and flush the toilet until the tank is mostly empty. Remove any remaining water with a sponge.Place a container under the tank where the supply line connects. Disconnect the supply line from the bottom of the toilet. Unscrew the fill valve retaining nut and remove the valve.Perform any necessary setup steps for the new valve. There will be a gasket that slides over the threaded portion at the bottom of the valve. The product instructions will provide tips for initial setup of the valve and float.Install the new fill valve with the mounting nut underneath the tank. Reattach the supply line.Attach the valve refill tube to the valve assembly and the overflow tube.Turn the water supply back on and adjust the fill valve float to the correct water level. Typically, you want the water to be about 1/2 inch to an inch below the overflow tube. The fill valve documentation should give you specifics.Test and check for leaks.Our how-to project on fixing a slow-flowing toilet has more details on correcting problems with a toilet fill rate.Toilet FloatThe toilet float works with the fill valve to control the water level in the tank. When the water rises, the float rises as well. Once the water reaches the correct level, the float causes the fill valve to close. If the float allows the water level to rise too much, the water drains through the overflow tube into the bowl and the toilet will run constantly to refill the tank. If the float keeps the water level too low, there may not be enough water for a strong flush.The float is an integrated part of newer fill valves, either externally or internally. See How to Fix a Fill Valve, above for instructions on replacing one of these valve and float assemblies. On older toilets, the float is a ball on the end of a rod or lift arm. The lift arm connects to the fill valve, opening and shutting it as the water level raises or lowers the ball. If the valve itself is in good shape, you may be able to repair the float simply by adjusting or replacing it.How to Fix a Toilet FloatTurn off the water supply valve. Flush the toilet to drain the tank and remove any remaining water. If the entire fill valve assembly is damaged or worn, replace it with a new valve using the steps above in How to Replace a Fill Valve.If the valve is in good shape and you have an integrated float, follow the manufacturerâs instructions for adjustment. Thereâs typically an adjustment screw that allows you to move the float up or down. If the valve is in good shape and you have a rod and ball assembly, replace the float by loosening the retaining screw that secures the lift rod and float to the fill valve. Install a new lift rod and float and tighten the retaining screw.Turn the water supply back on and test for proper filling and flushing. Adjust the float as necessary.Toilet Overflow Tube
The purpose of the toilet overflow tube is to keep the water in the tank from overflowing onto the bathroom floor. If the water in the toilet tank gets too high, it runs down the overflow tube and into the bowl, forcing excess water into the drain. The overflow tube is a part of the toilet flush valve assembly.How to Fix a Toilet Overflow TubeIf the tube is in good shape but the overflow process isnât working correctly â for example, if water is constantly running into the overflow â try adjusting the float on the fill valve so it closes the fill valve when the water reaches the correct level.If the bowl is not refilling correctly, you may need to adjust the refill tube. The small refill tube runs from the fill valve to the overflow tube. There should be a clip securing the refill tube to the overflow tube. If the tube isnât attached or isnât releasing water into the overflow tube, adjust the placement.If your overflow tube is damaged, youâll need to replace the entire flush valve using the tips in How to Fix a Toilet Flush Valve, below.Toilet Water Supply LineThe toilet water supply line connects to your homeâs water line and carries water to your toilet tank. One end of the supply line screws onto a water shut-off valve on the wall or floor while the other end screws onto the fill valve at the bottom of the toilet tank. The shut-off valve makes it easy and convenient to turn off the water supply during repairs. If the supply line is leaking at the shut-off valve or at the toilet fill valve, youâll need to repair or replace it.How to Fix a Toilet Water Supply LineClose the supply shut-off valve and place a small container under the supply line to catch any drips as you work. Drain the toilet tank. Use a sponge to remove any water that remains.Check to make sure the supply line is screwed securely onto the shut-off valve and the fill valve and that the fittings arenât cross threaded. Tighten the supply line fitting or remove it and thread it properly as necessary. Youâll need a wrench to remove and tighten the fitting at the shut-off valve. You can usually loosen and tighten the fitting at the fill valve by hand.If retightening the fittings doesnât fix the leak, replace the supply line. Unscrew the fittings at both ends and secure the new line. If you havenât replaced the fill valve in several years, this is a good time to swap out that part as well.With the line connected, turn the water back on and test for leaks.Good to Know
Some supply lines include an integrated shut-off valve. If youâre replacing your supply line, match the design of the new one to that of your existing supply line.Toilet Flush ValveYouâll find the toilet flush valve in the middle of the tank, at the drain hole in the bottom of the tank. The overflow tube and flapper are both part of the flush valve. When the flapper lifts, the flush valve allows the water to move from the tank into the toilet bowl to clear the waste. If water is leaking into the bowl through the flush valve, you may be able to make a simple fix by replacing the flapper using the instructions in How to Fix a Toilet Flapper Valve, above. If you canât remove the flapper from the flush valve assembly, the easiest way to repair it is to replace the entire flush valve assembly, including the flapper and overflow tube. As with the flapper, youâll need to determine if you need a 2-inch or 3-inch flush valve. Measure the existing part to get the correct size.How to Fix a Toilet Flush ValveTurn off the water supply and flush the toilet to get as much water out of the tank as possible. Use a sponge to remove any water that remains.Disconnect the water supply line from the tank and use a container to catch any drips.Remove the nuts securing the tank to the bowl. These will be on the underside of the bowl at the rear. Lift the tank from the bowl and set it on a plastic drop cloth where you have room to work.Remove the tank-to-bowl gasket from the threaded flush valve tailpiece that extends from the bottom of the tank. Unscrew the retaining nut holding the valve in place and pull the valve out of the tank.Ensure thereâs a small, beveled gasket on the valve at the top of the threaded section of the new valve. Place the new valve in the tank, inserting the tailpiece through the tank drain hole. Adjust the height of the overflow tube as necessary. The small gasket on the valve should seat into the hole with the bevel side down.On the underside of the tank exterior, install the cardboard friction washer onto the tailpiece, then install the retaining nut. Hand tighten the nut and give an additional half turn with tongue-and-groove pliers. Donât overtighten. Install the tank-to-bowl gasket onto the tailpiece, bevel side down.Install tank bolts in the tank, ensuring thereâs a rubber washer between the head and the tank on each fastener. Place the tank back on the bowl, add washers and alternate tightening the two nuts for the tank bolts until the tank is secured evenly. Be careful not to overtighten the nuts.Clip the refill tube to the overflow tube, turn the water supply back on and test the new flush valve.Toilet Tank O-Ring Seal or Toilet Gasket	Also known as the toilet gasket, the toilet tank seal creates a watertight connection between the tank and the bowl. This gasket fits over the bottom of the flush valve and has a beveled edge that seats into a hole at the back of the toilet base. The seal can degrade over time, allowing water to leak from the tank.
How to Fix a Toilet Tank O-Ring Seal or GasketRepairing a toilet seal or gasket requires replacing the part:Turn off the water supply and flush all the water from the tank, using a sponge to remove any remaining liquid. Disconnect the supply line, making sure you have something under it to catch spills.Remove the toilet tank retaining nuts and lift the tank away from the bowl. If you havenât replaced the flush valve and tank bolts in the last few years, this is a good time to do so using the instructions in How to Fix a Toilet Flush Valve, above.Remove the gasket from the flush valve tailpiece and install a new gasket. Make sure you place it on the tailpiece with the beveled edge pointing down.Replace the tank on the toilet bowl, making sure the new gasket seats properly into the hole on the toilet bowl. Reattach the tank to the bowl, but donât overtighten the retention nuts for the tank bolts.Turn the water supply back on and test the toilet, checking for leaks where the tank meets the bowl.Toilet Tank Lid
The tank lid or cover closes off the tank. Itâs usually breakable, so youâll want to remove it carefully and place it somewhere out of the way if you need to access any parts inside the tank. If the cover breaks, youâll likely need to replace it.
Toilet Bowl Parts
While most of the working parts of a toilet are in the tank, there are components that are part of the toilet bowl or base, starting with the bowl itself.
Toilet Bowl
The toilet bowl holds water and any waste. Holes around the underside of the bowl rim allow tank water to enter the bowl and allow the bowl to refill after a flush. The bowl houses the drain, which sends waste water to your house drain and sewer system through the curved, S-shaped channel, called the trapway. The tank, seat and lid are attached to the bowl. Toilet bowls can be round or elongated, the choice dictated by personal preference and available space in a bathroom.
How to Fix a Toilet BowlIf the bowl is loose and the toilet rocks back and forth, you can try popping off the toilet bolt covers and carefully tightening the toilet bolts. Donât overtighten. You can also install composite shims under the bowl to level and steady it. However, a toilet base that rocks back and forth or a toilet that leaks at the base may be a sign of a flange that needs repair. Weâll cover that process in How to Fix a Toilet Floor Flange, below.If the bowl itself is cracked, youâll need to replace it. See our how-to on replacing and installing a toilet for detailed steps.Toilet Wax RingThe toilet wax ring sits between the base of the toilet bowl and the toilet flange on the floor, sealing the connection between the toilet and the floor to prevent leaks. It may also be referred to as a toilet wax seal. Over time the toilet wax ring can leak, allowing waste water onto the floor or, in some cases, causing  water damage to the flooring and subfloor. A wax ring thatâs leaking will require replacement. See how to replace a toilet wax ring step by step with our how-to guide. Weâll cover the basic steps below.Tip
You may want to consider replacing your wax ring with a wax-free gasket. These gaskets use rubber or silicone seals to create a watertight connection.
How to Fix a Toilet Wax RingTurn off the water supply to the toilet and remove all the water from the tank. Place a container under the water supply line and disconnect it from the tank.Pop off the caps that cover the bolts securing the toilet to the floor. Remove the bolts and lift the toilet base off of the floor flange. Set it on wood blocks positioned on a plastic drop cloth. The blocks will help steady the toilet.Use a putty knife to remove the existing wax ring from the floor flange and the base of the toilet.Check the floor flange for damage. If you need to replace the flange, youâll find tips in How to Fix a Toilet Floor Flange, below.This is a good time to replace the toilet bolts. Put them in place on the flange.Place the new wax ring over the flange.Place the toilet base over the ring, twisting the base back and forth slightly as you press it over the seal and onto the floor.Install the washers and nuts onto the toilet bolts and alternate tightening the nuts a little at a time to keep the bowl level. Donât overtighten the nuts.Replace the bolt caps and reconnect the supply line to the tank. Turn on the water and check for leaks.Toilet Floor FlangeThe toilet flange or toilet floor flange is located between the floor and the bottom of the toilet. Also known as a closet flange, this fitting connects to the house drain pipe and allows you to secure the toilet to the floor with bolts and nuts. If your toilet flange is broken, it will allow the toilet to rock and can allow water to leak into your subfloor, damaging both the subfloor and flooring. If the section of the flange that fits into the drain is damaged, you may need to have a plumber replace the flange. However, if the ring the bolts fit into is the only area thatâs damaged, you may be able to make the repair yourself with a flange repair ring.How to Fix a Toilet Floor FlangeTurn off the water supply to the toilet. Flush the toilet and allow as much water as possible to drain from the tank and then remove any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line from the tank, being sure you have something under the line to catch any water.Unscrew the nuts on the toilet bolts and lift the toilet from the floor. Set it aside on blocks of wood on a drop cloth to keep it steady.Remove the toilet bolts from the flange and remove the wax ring material from the flange and the bottom of the toilet.Remove any broken parts of the existing flange. Apply silicone sealant to the top of the remaining flange.Place new toilet bolts into the existing flange and place the repair ring over the new bolts and onto the silicone sealant. Use screws to fasten the repair ring to the subfloor. Allow the sealant to cure fully according to the product instructions.Once the sealant has cured, place a new wax ring over the repair ring and place the toilet over the wax ring, twisting the toilet back and forth slightly to seat it fully onto the wax.Install the washers and nuts onto the toilet bolts, tightening first one and then the other in increments to keep the toilet level and secure it to the floor. Donât overtighten the nuts.Reconnect the water supply line, turn the water on and test the toilet for leaks.Toilet Lid and Toilet SeatThe toilet lid covers the toilet seat when the toilet is not being used. It also acts as a safety feature, keeping waste water spray from entering the air when you flush the toilet and helping keep children and pets away from the water in the bowl. The toilet seat will either be round or elongated to fit the toilet bowl.If the toilet lid and seat are loose, you can tighten the retaining nuts on the underside of the bowl. If the seat and lid are damaged, remove the nuts, lift the seat and lid assembly away and install a new set.Toilet Bolts
Toilet bolts secure the toilet to the floor. Caps that match the color of the toilet usually conceal the bolts to create a more aesthetically pleasing, finished look.
