Try Pumpkin Designs With Etching and MoreIf you want decorating ideas that are a bit different than a traditional carved pumpkin, weâve got some designs you can try. From etching to creating pumpkin lanterns, these ideas can give you a perfect porch for the season. TipWith etched designs, the pumpkinâs glow depends on the thickness of the flesh. For less light, leave the skin thick. For a lot of light, scrape the skin until itâs thin. You can speed up the process with an oscillating tool.Gingko Garland and Fall Leaf Pumpkin
