Plumbing
Few things are as frustrating as a leaky pipe. When left unattended, they can be destructive over time, which leads to costly repair work. But with the right knowledge and the right plumbing tools, you can fix your leak before you're drowning in costly water damage.
Finding the Right Fit
Over time, various pipe fittings will wear down and need to be replaced or repaired. Whether you're looking for PVC or copper pipe, Lowe's has the right fitting for your project or repair. We also offer free pipe threading and cutting in store so you can be sure to have the right size pipe for your needs.
Big Projects or Big Repairs
You may be needing plumbing supplies for larger repairs or replacements. With water heaters, water filtration systems and water pumps, there's no plumbing installation too big. Our Water Heater Buying Guide can help you decide what works best for you. We can also help with other common plumbing install jobs â such as adding a utility sink to your laundry room or updating your faucet.
Fix Your Toilet Troubles
Some of the most common plumbing issues in the home involve one of the more commonly used items: the toilet. Toilets can leak, become clogged or just run slower than they should. These problems sometimes require more than just a plunger. You might need a drain snake, drain opener or hand auger. We also have full toilet repair kits available or individual toilet components like flappers, chains and handles.
Plumbing issues can take a lot of your time and take a toll on your wallet. At Lowe's, you'll find the tools and expertise you need to get problems fixed and projects done right the first time.
