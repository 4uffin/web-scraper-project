Heating & Cooling Appliances for Maximum Comfort
Heating and Cooling AppliancesBeat the heat and banish the cold with the best window air conditioners, portable air conditioners, heating units and more from Lowe's. Consider your room size and get what you need.Window Air ConditionersKeep cool all summer everywhere in your home. Supplement your central air conditioning with an easy-mount window air conditioner and control the temperature in the room by adjusting its fan speed. Watch for the newer models with a thermostat. These units can automatically direct cooled air to the warmest part of a room. Additionally, they have a built-in timer, work with a remote and can be paired with a smartphone app.Portable Air Conditioning UnitsStay cool in any room with a portable air conditioning unit. These air conditioners cool the air in the room and vent it outdoors through an exhaust hose that slides through the bottom part of a partly open window. Get the size thatâs right for your rooms. Some portable air conditioners can cool even large rooms. Others offer heating features too.Ductless Mini SplitsYou can keep your family comfortable at home all year round with a ductless mini split. These wall-mounted units have both cooling and heating capabilities. They can be installed in a range of rooms since theyâre designed for rooms between 500 and 1700 square feet. Some models come with special features, including a dehumidifier, auto restart, quiet mode and memory function for airflow direction. Some can be paired with a smartphone app too.FurnacesGet the right furnace to keep you and your family cozy and warm during the cooler months. Forced air furnaces, which run on oil, create heat quickly and can be easily maintained with readily available replacement parts. Electric furnaces are often a good choice for mobile homes and very hot climates too. Be sure to get one thatâs correctly sized for your home since they dispense heat through your central heating system.Portable Space HeatersIf the heat from your home furnace doesnât reach all areas of your house and you and your family are left with cold spots â or even an entire cold room â you can turn the situation around and stay warm with an indoor portable space heater. Theyâre available in a range of sizes, from personal tabletop heaters for desks to large heaters intended to warm a whole room.Garage HeatersGarage heaters make it possible for garage workshops to remain viable even in the cold winter months. Go for a model that can be wall-or-ceiling-mounted and save floor space or pick up a portable model. Gas and electric models are both available.Fire PitsEnjoy good times in the backyard with family and friends even when it gets cool with fire pits. A fire pit can be a great outdoor heater, the glowing centerpiece of your backyard that makes the area as warm as it is inviting. A gas fire pit needs to be connected to a natural gas line. A propane-fueled pit runs independently of a line. Portable propane fire kits are lightweight, so you can carry one to the beach or a tailgate party.FireplacesFor a cozy night indoors warm up around a fireplace. Technology can bring the beauty and warmth of a fireplace to your home without the real danger of fire. Electric fireplaces use LED lights and mirrors to give the illusion of dancing flames as they employ forced fan or infrared heating to keep your room warm. Gas fireplaces come in freestanding and built-in models. Some require a flue or chimney, but others are ventless. Gas logs are also available to give the appearance of burning. Some models even crackle.Check out Lowe's extensive collection of air conditioners and heaters and see how you can keep the temperature of your home comfortable all year round.
