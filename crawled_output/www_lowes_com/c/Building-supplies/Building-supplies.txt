Building Materials
Build Your Dream HomeBefore you break ground on your new construction project, gather all of the building materials and tools you need. Whether you're just getting started on your build or ready for the finishing touches, Lowe's has products to help you create whatever you envision.The Place for LumberChoosing the right kind of wood is crucial, whether you're building a house or a piece of furniture. Dimensional lumber, which is milled on all four sides, is a popular choice for construction projects. Pressure-treated lumber is used only for exterior projects like raised garden beds or decks because it's resistant to rotting and damage from insects. Plywood sheets, oriented strand board (OSB) or medium-density fiberboard (MD) work well for furniture.All of the EssentialsTackle the fundamental materials for big renovations or new construction projects with products from Lowe's. Make drywall installation for all of your interior walls and ceiling easy with premixed drywall that will help join drywall panels together.Keep your new home light and bright with glass and acrylic windows. Polycarbonate and acrylic sheets are popular for things like skylights because they're lightweight, flexible and good at insulating. Taking care of a roofing or flooring project? Lowe's carries rubber sheets and rolls that can be used as underlayment or padding or can help insulate other projects.A Beautiful ExteriorAside from materials you can use to build a home, Lowe's carries products for general maintenance and do-it-yourself projects both inside and outside the home. Finish the outside of your home with siding, stone or brick veneer and find the nailers, saw blades and adhesive you need for the installation process. Consider turning structural supports into elegant exterior features with column wraps.Create a space for outdoor entertainment by adding a deck or patio to your home. Shop Lowe's for composite or lumber deck boards, deck railings and deck stairs and then find everything you need to seal and protect your deck. We also carry concrete, cement and masonry materials you'll need to pour a cement patio or build other stone or concrete structures. And browse our selection of fences that match your style to keep kids and pets contained or just add a bit of privacy to your yard.If you live in a flood plain or an area where land is prone to erosion, Lowe's has materials to help prevent weathering. Find flood bags, sand bags, erosion blankets and other materials to help preserve your land.A Cozy InteriorKeep air flowing properly inside your home with proper ventilation. Find vents for both the interior and exterior of your home such as roof vents or gable vents at Lowes.com. Make sure you have the proper dryer vents and accessories to keep your dryer running safely and effectively. Home insulation ensures that your home stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Consider unfaced roll insulation for a new build, foam board insulation for any larger cavities and spray foam insulation for filling cracks or gaps.Connect multiple floors of your home with stairs and railings in the style of your choice. Staircase kits provide everything you need for easy installation.
