easy as possible. Whether you need grass and grass seed to start a lawn or sprinklers, garden
hoses or accessories to maintain it, weâve got you covered. Think of fertilizer as a multivitamin for your lawn. It provides the nutrients that warm-weather
grass needs to create a strong root system. Strong root systems help support a healthy lawn
when temperatures soar. A word of caution, however: Use a light hand, as too much fertilizer
can burn your lawn.Fall is the best time to fertilize cool-season grasses, like fescue, bluegrass and ryegrass. Look for
fertilizers that are specially formulated for the fall season, as theyâll help feed your lawn all
winter to build strong roots. Also, to help control weeds, a fertilizer with weed pre-emergents
will keep annoying invaders like dandelions and clover under control.Need help deciding when to plant grass seed? Check out our guide online, which includes
information on distinct types of grass by climate as well as step-by-step instructions on how to

Add a personal touch with garden dÃ©cor, like birdbaths, accent lighting and garden statues. Landscaping products, like pavers and retaining wall block, can turn a plain space into a beautiful, functional outdoor area. Mulch does more than make flower beds and borders look neat and tidy, as it controls weeds and helps plants retain moisture, especially in hot weather.
