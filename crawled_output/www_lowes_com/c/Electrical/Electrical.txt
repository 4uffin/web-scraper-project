Power Up With All Things Electrical
At Lowe's, we have an extensive electrical department with all the tools
and equipment you'll need to tackle any electrical project in your home. From
electrical outlets and wall switches to battery chargers and generators, we've
got the hardware to help you get your job done right.
Build Up Your Electrical Know-How
Diving into an electrical project can be intimidating. If you're
uncomfortable with the idea of doing it yourself, see Lowe's Home Services to
find a professional. Ready to get to work but want a refresher? We've got the
resources to help. If you're worried there might be a problem with your circuit
breaker, check out our guide â How To Replace a Circuit Breaker. Want to add
some overhead lights in your game room? Install Track Lighting gives you
step-by-step directions. Find out whether or not you need a ground fault
circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet in the bathroom in our Outlets and Switch
Guides Lowe's offers a variety of how-to information and buying guides for
electrical repairs.
Be Ready for Severe Weather
Inclement weather can strike at any time, so it's important to have the
equipment you need to keep your family safe. Hurricanes, flooding and other
disasters can cut the power to your home and leave you in the dark. Make sure
to stock up on flashlights, battery-operated lanterns, extra batteries and LED
candles. It may also be a good idea to have a battery-operated radio or
television. Consider purchasing a generator for a backup power supply source. A
home standby generator is a long-term solution for backup power, while a
portable generator can provide a temporary power source when the power's out.
Home Remodeling
When it comes to remodeling a room in your home or building one in the
basement or in an add-on, Lowe's has the tools and hardware to help you on your
way. We carry a variety of electrical essentials, from extension cords and
surge protectors to electrical boxes and wiring. Remember to stay safe with
safety glasses and work gloves while working around electricity. Work gloves
are available in sizes small through extra-large.
