Redecorate Your Home With On-Trend Lights and Ceiling Fans
Discover New Lighting and Ceiling Fans at Loweâs
Upgrading your lighting and ceiling fans can be a smart way to redo your dÃ©cor while keeping your home bright and comfortable year round.
Upgraded Aesthetics
At Loweâs, youâll find lights with modern designs that add a stylish look to any room and set the tone for the space. But donât stop with lights. New ceiling fans can also make bold additions to your home. With designs that turn functional fans into decorative elements, ceiling fans can add comfort and beauty to any room.
Improved Functionality
Set the perfect mood for any holiday activity with new lighting. Create a warm, comfortable area for meals with family and friends. And when itâs time for wrapping gifts, you can add the right light for a fun and festive workspace.
A Variety of Options
We offer a wide range of lights, so youâre sure to find fixtures that are right for your home and personal style. Plus, you can shop our extensive collection of ceiling fans and replace your existing fixtures to add comfort and new design elements. Choose lighting and ceiling fans in finishes like nickel, bronze, gold and more. And since we have styles ranging from modern to farmhouse and beyond, youâre sure to find the look you want.
Floor Lamps
Enjoy portable, stylish lighting where you need it with a floor lamp. Keep your home bright for happy times with friends and family or create a halo of light as you enjoy a book or magazine in the evening. A wide variety of models are available, from standard to swing arm to a torchiere with reading light. Go with a traditional or energy-efficient model.
Table Lamps
Make a decorative statement with an attractive table lamp that complements your furniture and artwork. Brighten a drab corner of your room with a stylish lamp or use matching lamps to create symmetry. Make redecorating easier by replacing only a lamp shade instead of the entire fixture and control your energy bills by illuminating only the areas you need.
Chandeliers
You can use chandeliers in any room of your home to create a stunning sense of drama and brighten the entire space. Choose from traditional, elegant designs for the dining room or sleek, modern fixtures for the kitchen. There are several options, including chandeliers with one bulb to hundreds, in numerous finishes and colors.
Pendant Lights
Hanging pendant lights are similar to chandeliers, but they come without branched lighting and with fewer bulbs. Theyâre great for smaller areas, like kitchen islands and bathroom sinks, where you want focused light for close work. Go with a sleek, modern style, traditional farmhouse style or something in between. Loweâs carries a huge variety of designs to match and accentuate the dÃ©cor of any room.
Vanity Lights
Lend the same sense of elegance and design to your bathroom as the other rooms in your home with vanity lights. Place glamorous vanity lights over your sink and in corners to create a dramatic effect as you illuminate areas that need good lighting for close work, like putting on makeup or shaving.
Ceiling Fans
Ceiling fans add extra cooling to rooms when you need it. Theyâre also great for slightly warmer days and provide just enough cooling when an air conditioner is too much. In the winter, they can help you make the most of your homeâs heating. Choose from fan-only models or modern ceiling fans with lights included to brighten your room as you make it more comfortable. Outdoor fans can help you beat the heat when youâre in outdoor spaces, like patios, and are perfect for when youâre entertaining guests or enjoying an outdoor meal with the family.
Outdoor Lighting
Increase the curb appeal of your home and make it easier for guests to find your house for evening get-togethers with outdoor lighting. Select a wall-mounted model designed to withstand the most brutal weather. Or go with a traditional model or a light- or motion-sensitive design. You should also consider path lights for the ultimate practical addition to your lawn. Durable path lights illuminate walkways and stairways and help prevent nighttime slips and falls. Go with a hard-wired, plug-in, battery-powered or solar-powered model.
Track LightingTrack lights can brighten virtually any area of your home, but theyâre especially useful in places that are difficult to light, such as hallways, home offices and large living areas. Also, installing kitchen track lighting will give you the illumination you need for preparing food and cooking. And if you want to save on your monthly energy bill, LED track lighting will provide the same amount of brightness at a much lower cost.
