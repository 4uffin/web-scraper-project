Weâll help break down the most popular types and where to use them.Types of Moulding and Best ApplicationsCrown moulding creates charm and soft transition where walls and ceilings meet. Itâs typically used to create a classy look in a space, most notably in areas where you want a more dressed-up feel, such as in dining rooms. But it can also transform living rooms, bedrooms and even surfaces like the tops of cabinets, mantels and bookshelves. Crown moulding styles are plentiful, so you can choose a look that blends with your homeâs interior, from modern designs to classic dentil moulding and more.Chair rail, also known as wainscoting, is a functional and stylish type of moulding that offers protection from chairs hitting the wall as theyâre pushed out in spaces like dining rooms. You can also use it as a purely decorative element in your home. Designed to be applied on the wall about 1/3 of the way up from the floor, it instantly makes a statement wherever itâs installed.Baseboard is an essential for covering gaps between floorboards or carpeted edges and adjoining walls. Baseboard trim creates a smooth transition from wall to floor, similar to crown moulding for ceilings.Casing, with options like door trim and window trim, makes it easy to frame features and turn them into a focal point while also covering the gaps between drywall and framing.Brick moulding is designed for exterior use. It creates a decorative trim around door jambs or windows on the outside of your home, closing the gap between siding and frame.Lattice moulding is typically used outdoors to create privacy for patios and fences, but you can also use it for concealing joints or as a decorative touch in edges of interior corners.
Other decorative trim, including details like corner blocks, plinths, rosettes, corbels, decorative wood brackets and finials, are all designed to add unique architectural touches to your home.
