Windows, Window Shutters and Garage Doors
All the Windows and Doors Your Home Needs
Choosing the right interior doors, exterior doors and windows is a crucial part of giving your home a cohesive style. Find the windows and doors thatâll help your home look its best at Loweâs.
Garage Doors and Openers
Garage doors come in single- or double-panel styles. Single-panel garage
doors have a more vintage look, and they take up more space than doors that
have hinged double panels. Want your garage door to have windows? You can
filter your search on Lowes.com by that preference. You can also filter your
garage door search by choosing double or single springs, and you can filter a
search for garage door openers by what kind of drive you want your opener to
have. Options include chain, direct and belt drives.
Front Doors and Other Exterior Doors
Front doors commonly come in fiberglass, steel or wood and can have many
different configurations of glass set into them â or no glass at all. If you
want a grand entrance to your home, consider a double door. If youâd like to be
able to see whoâs at your door, filter your search on Lowes.com to specify
doors that have one or two sidelites, which are windows set into the door
frame.
At Loweâs, we also carry a variety of storm doors and patio doors so
that you can customize all entries and exits to your home. Also, if you want to
add an easy-access door for your pet, we have large, medium and small pet doors
for furry friends of different sizes.
Interior Doors
The doors inside your home help you maintain privacy and divide up your
floor plan. At Loweâs, we carry interior doors in many popular styles, such as
French doors, barn doors and pocket doors. French doors, which typically have
glass insets, or glass barn doors give you the flexibility to add privacy while
still allowing two spaces to feel connected. Barn doors, sliding closet doors,
pocket doors, accordion doors and bifold doors are space-saving options that
donât take up as much square footage as a traditional swinging door.
Windows for Your Whole Home
Whether youâre looking for small basement windows or large picture
windows, we have options to suit your needs. If youâre interested in windows
with sashes, or movable panels, consider whether youâd prefer a double hung or
single hung window. Double hung windows have two sashes that move to open the
window, typically on the top and bottom, while a double hung window has only
one sash. Loweâs also carries sliding windows and windows that tilt.
Window Shutters and Accessories
Dress up your windows with shutters to boost the curb appeal of your
home. Shutters can be strictly decorative, meaning they donât move, or they can
be both decorative and functional. Louvered shutters have slats that you can
open and close to adjust the amount of light coming through your windows. Board
and batten shutters â which incorporate vertical boards and horizontal cross
beams called battens â can have either a rustic or classic look, depending on
the finish. Some shutters are even adaptable for use inside.
Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: What are some types of energy-efficient windows? A: For energy efficiency, look for hinged windows, such as awning windows, casement windows or ENERGY STARÂ® windows. Another option would be low-emissive (Low-E) windows, which have a thin coating on the interior of the glass that helps to maintain your desired indoor temperature.Q: What are some types of durable exterior doors? A: For durability and security, you canât go wrong with a steel door. Exterior steel doors wonât crack or warp, and theyâre easy to maintain. Vinyl doors are another durable door option. Theyâre non-corrosive, and they resist termites and moisture.Q: What are the signs that I need to replace my windows?
A: Replacing windows might be a good idea if your windows are jamming or sticking and becoming difficult to operate. Other signs include panes with a lot of condensation or mold, or damaged seals that can lead to drafts. Also, if you have outdated windows or the curb appeal of your home isnât what it used to be, it may be time to get those windows replaced.
