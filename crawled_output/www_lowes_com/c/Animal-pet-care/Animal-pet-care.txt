They both give dogs a sense of security, but they differ in size and placement. Crates are smaller and are used indoors whereas kennels â which function as semipermanent structures â offer more space and are used in outdoor settings.Q: What types of toys do cats like to play with?A: Popular cat toys include lightweight plastic balls, small plush toys, collapsible cat tunnels and teasers with feathers at the end, which entice cats to jump and chase. Other cat toy options include cat enrichment towers, including towers that encourage cats to interact with balls on a circular track. There are also laser beams you can point at objects to encourage cats to get moving. Whether you want to keep your cat busy while youâre away from home or spend time interacting with your cat, Loweâs has a variety of cat toy options to choose from.Q: How tall should a pet gate be for dogs and cats?A: The ideal height for a pet gate depends on your petâs size and behavior. Some dogs and cats will respect gates that are 28 to 30 inches high, whereas other dogs and cats may need to be confined with a gate thatâs higher, such as one that stands at 36 inches tall. Always test a new pet gate while youâre home in case your dog or cat decides to jump over it into an off limits area.
