Loweâs is your go-to destination for all things home dÃ©cor. Whether your home is decorated in a farmhouse style or features a more classic look, we have a variety of dÃ©cor to suit any taste. Our selection of home dÃ©cor includes furniture, lighting, area rugs, wall art and more, all in a wide assortment of styles, colors and themes and waiting to transform the rooms of your home into something amazing. Maybe youâre looking to update your walls with a fresh look. Instead of paint, try peel-and-stick wallpaper in a pretty design or with a textured appearance. Rugs are perfect for cozying up spaces like living rooms or bedrooms with a soft surface underfoot. As the seasons change, swapping out throw pillows on your couch is an easy way to create an updated look. If youâve recently bought new furniture, maybe itâs time for new curtains, too. No matter which room youâre decorating, all our home dÃ©cor styles make it possible to create spaces that reflect who you are.
Relaxed Coastal DÃ©cor
Invite the serene spirit of the morning beach indoors with the Coastal collection. An array of shore-inspired pieces complements a sturdy, solid, thickly padded sofa and loveseat in a calming neutral tone. Accent pillows, created with coastal patterns in mind, add a pop of color. Coffee tables and end tables in natural wood patterns complement the look. Mimic a sunlit sky with hanging light fixtures in coastline-inspired colors and attractive designs. Let the ocean breeze waft past your windows through window panels in seaside-inspired hues. Include a touch of softness with no-care artificial hanging plants. Complete the look with durable area rugs, available in a range of sizes.
Farmhouse Decoration
Comfort is key in the Farmhouse Retreat Style collection. A sturdy, comfortable sofa and chairs in tranquil neutral colors set the tone. Pair them with a piece from a carefully curated selection of living room accent tables specially designed to evoke rustic home dÃ©cor. Coordinating home wall dÃ©cor, wallpaper, wall mirrors and understated, yet elegant curtain panels provide an inviting backdrop to your roomâs design. Woven area rugs and accent pillows add texture. Complete the cozy, welcoming look with coordinating area rugs that are available in many sizes and able to withstand heavy traffic.
Classic Design
Traditional dÃ©cor gets a tasteful update in the Classics collection. Comfortable sofas and chairs in neutral tones pair perfectly with the geometric frames of paintings, coordinating panel curtains and rustic wall clocks. Adding accent pillows and throws in a variety of textures brings depth to your room. Hanging and potted artificial plants offer homey pops of color. Finish your rooms with durable area rugs. Vanities in coordinating style keep your bathroom in decorative sync with the rest of your home.
Global Style
For a touch of international sophistication, explore the Global Style home dÃ©cor collection. Add excitement to a room with rattan-inspired chairs crafted in sturdy, painted metal. Create a global vibe with a coffee table inspired by Eastern design. Richly textured, knitted ottomans add interest to your living room sectional. Bright, geometric, handmade woven pillows liven up a neutral sofa. Or mix and match pieces from more traditional styles with contemporary accent pieces. Pair deeply padded, clean-lined sofas and chairs with rattan lighting fixtures, wooden console tables and silk trees. Harmonize your creation with coordinating area rugs that stand up to high traffic.
