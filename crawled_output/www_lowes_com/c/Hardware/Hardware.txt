No matter what your next project is, itâs bound to require hardware. From screws and bolts to
locks and latches, Loweâs has the parts youâll need to get the job done right.Door Knobs and Locks
Consider what level of security you need when choosing a door knob. Select a keyed knob for front and back doors to help keep intruders out. Go with passage knobs with decorative finishes for interior rooms and closets. Privacy door knobs are great for bedrooms, bathrooms, storage closets and other sensitive locations. They come with a latch and keyless locking mechanisms.
Take home security up a level with a door lock designed to provide your home with an extra
layer of protection. Traditional deadbolts, often paired with a keyed knob, are available
individually or in handlesets for a cohesive look.
Loweâs carries Schlage deadbolts and full Schlage handlesets with handles and deadbolts included. Or, if you prefer the security of code entry, you can opt for an electronic deadbolt or a Schlage keypad. Smart locks enable users to control security through a smartphone app. And some smart locks are compatible with home automation systems, too, for an integrated experience.
If youâre looking to update your existing door hardware, we carry Schlage door handles, Kwikset door handles and more. Try a new look with a Kwikset door knob.
