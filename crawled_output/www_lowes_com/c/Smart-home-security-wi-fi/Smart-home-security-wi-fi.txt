Create a Smarter HomeWith smart home products from Loweâs, home living has never been easier. In fact, most smart home systems and smart home automation systems can be controlled by your smartphone. With the Samsung SmartThings Hub, you can effortlessly monitor and control any smart appliances and devices in your home from the palm of your hand. All you need is the Samsung Connect Home app to set your wireless light switch to turn the lights on when you get home, have the doors lock automatically when you leave or even get video alerts of unexpected activity.Smart home digital thermostats are a popular area in the smart programmable thermostat market. These wireless thermostats connect through your homeâs Wi-Fi, allowing you to adjust and control temperatures with ease. Our selection of smart home Wi-Fi thermostats includes Nest Thermostat options, like the original Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Thermostat 3rd Generation, Honeywell smart thermostats, smart Honeywell programmable thermostats, ecobee thermostats and a few others.Smart home security is another important area to think about, and we offer a variety of tools to help keep your home safe, like a Nest Security Camera or Ring video doorbells. When using a video doorbell, an embedded camera allows you to see whoâs at the door and speak to them no matter where you are. We also carry keyless door locks, smart door locks and Wi-Fi door locks. Even smoke detectors have gotten smarter, and a Nest Smoke Alarm is a great choice. A host of our smart products are compatible with the Apple home automation system, Apple HomeKit. Pair them up and youâll have an Apple smart home in no time. Plus with a Google Wi-Fi Router, your smart appliances and devices will have access to a steady, reliable internet connection, keeping you in full control of your smart home from anywhere.
