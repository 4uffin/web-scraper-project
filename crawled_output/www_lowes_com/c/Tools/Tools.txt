We can help you build and enhance your tool box so you can repair a leaky sink, build a deck and much more. From cordless power tools to welding essentials, weâve got you covered.
Cordless ConvenienceCordless power tools, like nail guns and drills, are a popular choice on the jobsite, allowing you to move freely from project to project without the restriction of a cord. With our selection of cordless power tools, you can swap out pieces like pneumatic nailers â and the hoses and loud compressors that go with them â with a convenient cordless nail gun. And if youâve got a particular brand you prefer, we carry trusted names like DEWALT cordless tools, Bostitch, CRAFTSMAN and more.All Hammers Arenât the SameWhether itâs being used for household tasks or construction projects, a good hammer is an essential tool. Different types and styles allow you to match the hammer to the job. For all-purpose use, such as hanging pictures or removing nails, a curved claw hammer is the best choice. For more delicate work, consider a rubber mallet, as it delivers a softer impact compared to other hammers. And for those tough demolition projects, the heavy head of a sledgehammer is the best choice.Workspace Illumination
Itâs important to have good lighting in areas in which youâre working. Make sure you can see what youâre doing by using flashlights, headlamps or standing lights designed to provide bright LED illumination in dim and dark spaces.
Accomplish It All With an Air CompressorWhether youâre working in a garage or on a jobsite, air compressors can handle a variety of tasks. Top off the air in your vehicleâs tires, complete a roofing project or take the rust off the exterior of a car. Choose from stationary compressors â designed for extended periods of uninterrupted use â or opt for a portable air compressor if you need to move easily from one work area to another. For more information on different types of air compressors, their features and accessories, check out our buying guide here.Other Tools to ConsiderWrenches are a handy tool, and they come in a variety of styles to suit different tasks.
