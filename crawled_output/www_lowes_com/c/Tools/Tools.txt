Successfully tackling repairs, projects and builds requires the right tools, and Loweâs is here to make sure you have what you need. We can help you build and enhance your tool box so you can repair a leaky sink, build a deck and much more. From cordless power tools to welding essentials, weâve got you covered.
Cordless ConvenienceCordless power tools, like nail guns and drills, are a popular choice on the jobsite, allowing you to move freely from project to project without the restriction of a cord. With our selection of cordless power tools, you can swap out pieces like pneumatic nailers â and the hoses and loud compressors that go with them â with a convenient cordless nail gun. And if youâve got a particular brand you prefer, we carry trusted names like DEWALT cordless tools, Bostitch, CRAFTSMAN and more.All Hammers Arenât the SameWhether itâs being used for household tasks or construction projects, a good hammer is an essential tool. Different types and styles allow you to match the hammer to the job. For all-purpose use, such as hanging pictures or removing nails, a curved claw hammer is the best choice. For more delicate work, consider a rubber mallet, as it delivers a softer impact compared to other hammers. And for those tough demolition projects, the heavy head of a sledgehammer is the best choice.Workspace Illumination
Itâs important to have good lighting in areas in which youâre working. Make sure you can see what youâre doing by using flashlights, headlamps or standing lights designed to provide bright LED illumination in dim and dark spaces.
Accomplish It All With an Air CompressorWhether youâre working in a garage or on a jobsite, air compressors can handle a variety of tasks. Top off the air in your vehicleâs tires, complete a roofing project or take the rust off the exterior of a car. Choose from stationary compressors â designed for extended periods of uninterrupted use â or opt for a portable air compressor if you need to move easily from one work area to another. For more information on different types of air compressors, their features and accessories, check out our buying guide here.Other Tools to ConsiderWrenches are a handy tool, and they come in a variety of styles to suit different tasks. There are adjustable wrenches, combination wrenches, basin wrenches and more. Some can handle an assortment of jobs, while others are designed for more specific tasks.Need to lubricate machines or other surfaces? Look for a grease gun to help you quickly and easily grease the applicable parts and keep them in proper working order.A tape measure allows you to take measurements quickly and conveniently. With different lengths available and features like auto-lock and high visibility blades, you can tackle a variety of projects â big and small â with ease.Stay Organized
Tool storage is important not only for organization but for transportation and safety. Whether itâs a small household tool box, a rolling tool chest and cabinet combo, or a lockable jobsite tool box, Loweâs has the right size to house your tools and protect them from the elements.
Bring the Heat
If youâre in the welding business, weâve got an assortment of welding supplies to help you tackle the different types of welding, including stick welding. Look for plasma cutters to slice metal. Stay protected while you work with welding helmets, gloves and other safety gear essential to any welding project.
Jobsite Safety
Taking measures to prevent injury while you work is top priority. We carry all sorts of protective gear to keep you safe on the job, ranging from safety glasses to hearing protection, work boots and more.
