Find All You Need for a Home Gym â From Ellipticals to Water Bottles
At Loweâs, finding what you need to create a home gym has never been
easier. Whether youâre looking for the best home gym equipment, fitness
trackers, dumbbells or other gym accessories, weâve got you covered.
Your Favorite Workouts, at HomeThe best part of a home gym is being able to work out whenever your
schedule allows, without a commute. And whether youâre an avid runner, a yogi, a
cyclist or a fan of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts, we carry the
right gym equipment to help you bring your workouts home. Choose from our great
selection of stationary bikes, strength training machines, fitness towers
and more.
Need some motivation? Consider treadmills, bikes and ellipticals that
come with iFit memberships included so you can tune into virtual instructor-led
workouts from your living room or garage. From the best exercise bikes
to the best ellipticals, weâve got the perfect exercise equipment to suit your
lifestyle.
Home Gym Must-HavesWhen assembling a home gym, youâll want to consider several factors.
The first is flooring. Ideally, youâll want to lay down rubber mats to make floor
workouts more comfortable. Lighting is also important. At Loweâs, we have a
great selection of industrial track lights that can turn dark spaces into bright,
safe workout areas.
Mini fridges also make a great addition to a home gym, as theyâre
perfect for storing water bottles, sports drinks and cold towels. If you donât
want to invest in a small refrigerator, check out Igloo hard coolers to keep
your drinks cold. Or consider Camp-Zero coolers. Be sure to shop our wide
selection of coolers with
wheels for easy portability.
Small, At-Home Gym AccessoriesLack the space for a full at-home gym? No problem. At Loweâs, we carry
a variety of popular small essentials like medicine balls, resistance bands,
yoga mats, jump ropes and pull-up bars. We even carry fitness trackers to help
you monitor progress in your home and outdoor workouts. Choose from a variety
of adult and kids fitness trackers to find the best fitness tracker
for you and your family.Water Bottles and Jugs
Staying hydrated during workouts is extremely important. Weâve got
many kinds of water
bottles to help you do just
that. Shop our selection of basic water bottles, insulated
water bottles, water bottles with
lids and straws, and options that are free of bisphenol A (BPA). Popular
choices include Sâwell water bottles, Contigo water bottles
and Stanley water bottles.
At Loweâs, we also carry premium water jugs like the Stanley Thermos and Stanley Coffee Thermos â which have advanced
cooling technologies. Keep your beverages cool for up to four hours and iced
for up to 17 hours.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Which
types of fitness equipment are best for home gyms?
A: The best
fitness equipment for your home depends on your specific fitness needs. Thatâs
why our selection includes equipment for everything from casual exercise to intense
fitness programs. Options include yoga mats and resistance bands, as well as stationary
bikes, treadmills and ellipticals, among other equipment. Contact your health care
provider before starting a new fitness program to ensure that you arenât
pushing yourself too hard.
Q: How long does ice last in an insulated water bottle?
A: Generally,
ice lasts between four to 18 hours in insulated water bottles. Melting time varies
based on factors like bottle brand and material, ice size and the temperature
of your surroundings. Plastic water bottles usually stay cooler than stainless
steel water bottles because plastic conducts heat less efficiently. Stainless
steel water bottles are best for keeping your beverages at room temperature.
Q: How do I keep my portable cooler
cold?
A: Itâs easy to
keep your portable cooler cold on hot days. Start by pre-chilling food and
beverages to help keep your ice cold. Place frozen water bottles in open spaces
to help keep your ice from melting. Consider putting your ice in your cooler
after all food and beverages are in place. Waiting keeps the ice in your freezer
longer, helping to prevent melting. When youâre outside, place your cooler in a
shaded area, such as under an umbrella. Also, keep water in your cooler as the
ice melts because water acts as an insulator and helps keep everything else
cool.
