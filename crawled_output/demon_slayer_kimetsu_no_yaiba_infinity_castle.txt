Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

Peter Debruge
Variety
Beyond the sheer inventiveness of the movie’s made-up martial arts, that leaves the tragic elements, which can be disarmingly effective in giving audiences reason to feel invested in the battles -- battles that have only just begun.

While the plot is simple, the visual imagery and the emotions are complex.
Rated: 3/4

From intricate backgrounds to propulsive fight choreography, everything is vividly rendered to perfection. Infinity Castle really looks like it belongs on the big screen. The problem is that it feels like it belongs on the small screen in some key aspects

Bounding Into Comics
Infinity Castle is one of the most action-packed and gorgeously animated films of the year. The film has an absorbing story, vastly interesting characters, and a finale that closes one exciting chapter while teasing the next and possibly bloodier one.
Rated: 4/5

I've never watched Demon Slayer episodes before and I still loved this movie. I took my teenage child who is a super anime fan. We dressed up in cosplay. I really enjoyed the fact that there were parts in the movie that gave back story to help understand the great storyline. The movie is filled with lots of action, some funny parts, sad parts, suspense and leaves you wanting to watch more!
This movie I would definitely recommend as a must see. The movie is suitable for teens and up. Warning: Lots and lots of blood, demons, fighting combat violence, and a situation of self deletion. Fantastic movie for teens and adults. There is no after credits, but there is a part 2 and 3 coming out in 2027 and 2029. Can't wait.

This was an epic build up opening to the movie series. A nice balance of action with story arcs of the demons giving them more character and the viewers another perspective of who they are.
