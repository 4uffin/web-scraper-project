Terms and Policies
Terms and PoliciesLast Updated: October 06, 2024
When we
say “our”, “us”, “we” or “Fandango” in the Fandango Terms and Policies, we mean Fandango Media, LLC or its
subsidiaries. The Fandango Terms and Policies apply to websites and applications operating under the Fandango, Fandango at Home, Vudu, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster, Movieclips, Movies.com, Activaterewards.com, MovieTickets.com or M-GO brands or
other brands that we own, as well as to our websites, applications, emails or other communications that link
to or reference any terms or policies that are a part of the Fandango Terms and Policies (each, a “Fandango Policy”), or the other services provided through any of these means (all of the foregoing collectively, the “Services”). From time to time, we may revise the Fandango Terms and Policies. You can determine when this Terms and Policies webpage was last revised by referring to the top of this page. Any changes to the Fandango Terms and Policies will
become effective upon posting of the applicable revised Fandango Policy on the Internet, accessible through
Services, unless otherwise noted. By continuing to use Services following such changes, you will be deemed to have
agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with the terms of the Fandango Terms and Policies, as they may be
amended from time to time, please do not use the Services. To the extent
that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to the Fandango Terms
and Policies would render the Fandango Terms and Policies an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a
prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes.
The Fandango Terms and Policies (the “Fandango Terms and Policies”)
consist of this Terms and Policies webpage and the following:
