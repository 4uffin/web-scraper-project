Dan Einav
Financial Times
Hacks continues to interrogate Deborah and Ava’s shared sense of what it is to be ambitious and perennially dissatisfied... The result is a comedy that can deliver a killer punchline one moment, and a gut-punch the next.
Rated: 4/5

Guardian
Stick with it and you will be rewarded with one of the most compelling character studies currently gracing our screens. Via Deborah, the show’s creators are able to muse on the nature of success and happiness through an uncommon vessel: an elderly woman.
Rated: 4/5

The comedy series is as funny and touching as ever. Both Jean Smart and Hannah Einbinder continue to shine, but so do the supporting cast – and the awesome guest stars.

Cinéfilo Serial
A series that stands out thanks to its main duo, but also to the supporting cast, who have their moments to shine, and a good approach to serious topics through humor. [Full Review in Spanish]

The Arts Desk
Deborah’s Late Night quest provides the spine for the season, and Smart’s mercurial, multi-layered and sometimes scary performance remains a thing of wonder.

Hacks season three is by far my favorite season of the show yet. The writing and the dynamic between the two leads is outstanding. I love all the supporting characters who really stand on their own this season and give different perspectives than our two leads. I love how every season we reach for different goals and we try so hard to make them work, like with this season it’s about being a late night host. I think the creators and writers did a fantastic job incorporating everything into this season and it is truly the best season so far.

Wow!
The writting is insanely great.
Thanks for talking and discussing panic attacks and anxiety,
and making it mainstream… thats exactly how I felt years back when I was going to the hospital to check my heart! It was panics.
People will find comfort and learn from this. I wish other shows follow and help people who suffer from panics. Mucj thanks for brining this,
means so much for me and others I am sure.
Best show in TV right now.

I used to be a stand-up comic. I was young and green and I wasn't made out of the same stuff as Deborah Vance so I didn't make it. It's a tough business and Hacks shows that, even though Deborah has by now reached the top, with the house, the fleet of staff and the private jet to prove it. But she's still hungry for more - and there's a poignancy about that: maybe a 70 year old should put her feet up and chill. I'm so glad that this grand dame of a character (and the actor who plays her) are still game, however, as this is an absolute joy of a show. The central relationship of Ava and Deborah is so brilliantly handled by the writers that we believe the ups and downs of it unquestioningly. And the ancillary characters are so finely developed, with sub plots that are quite delicious in themselves, that the show feels really rich and layered. It ticks all the boxes for an excellent comedy drama - hugely entertaining, emotionally provocative, brutal yet compassionate. I love those women and I don't envy them one bit.

GODAM, gotta wait for 4. Acting, story, pace, marvelous. Socialmanaged way better than the demcrap that was becoming the new (effing insane) normal. Kudos to the artists that brought this.
It's a fairytale, but a really good one.
