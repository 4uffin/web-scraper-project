Hacks is compelling and insightful when focused on its core story: the bizarre friendship/enemyship/working relationship between Vance and her talented head writer, Hannah Einbinder's Ava Daniels.

...the show now feels motivated and coherent in ways it has not accomplished before.

Globe and Mail
This season, more than most, there’s been a raw and surprisingly relatable exploration of the cost of comedy and fame and where to draw the line.

La han criticado por repetitiva, pero creo que los conflictos que las separan en cada momento son distintos y las dinámicas que se desarrollan a partir de eso también son diferentes. Además todo es acumulativo y todo tiene consecuencias. Sigue fantástica.

I was very disappointed by this season. There were some bright moments but honestly I may skip some of these episodes upon rewatching -- the central dynamic is just gone.

While arguably it's weakest season yet, this is a strong, engaging continuation that proves Hacks can keep its comedic edge while allowing its characters to evolve.

Season 4 finds the series losing its way after steadily improving during Seasons 1-3.
In Season 4, the charm is gone, the dialogue is relentlessly negative and strident, too much of the humor falls flat and much of the cast's chemistry has evaporated.
Such a lost opportunity!

The opposition between the duo is dragged out, which takes out of the series its main strength, which is the incredibly well written chemistry between them. Despite that, it remains on of the best written, lovable and hilrious comedies of the moment.
