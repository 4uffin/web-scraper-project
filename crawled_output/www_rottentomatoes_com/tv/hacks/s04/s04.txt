Hacks is compelling and insightful when focused on its core story: the bizarre friendship/enemyship/working relationship between Vance and her talented head writer, Hannah Einbinder's Ava Daniels.

Globe and Mail
This season, more than most, there’s been a raw and surprisingly relatable exploration of the cost of comedy and fame and where to draw the line.

La han criticado por repetitiva, pero creo que los conflictos que las separan en cada momento son distintos y las dinámicas que se desarrollan a partir de eso también son diferentes. Además todo es acumulativo y todo tiene consecuencias. Sigue fantástica.

Smart women going toe-to-toe to survive in their industry. They're vile, selfish, admirable, and empathetic. Brilliant on every level.

I was very disappointed by this season. There were some bright moments but honestly I may skip some of these episodes upon rewatching -- the central dynamic is just gone.

While arguably it's weakest season yet, this is a strong, engaging continuation that proves Hacks can keep its comedic edge while allowing its characters to evolve.
