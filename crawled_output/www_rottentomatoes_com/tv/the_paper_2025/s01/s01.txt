Critics Consensus
The Paper still has edits to be made but gets off to a promising start, establishing amusing dynamics and a genuine conviction for journalism that make for a potentially worthy successor to The Office.

The Paper is droll enough to start, though a bit chaotic, and it will take a while for the actors to fully inhabit their roles. But then so was The Office, and look what happened to that series.

These characters and actors will win you over quickly and completely, partly because the performances are so smart and partly because the writing is, too.

They don't do a lot of direct referencing of The Office...But...[the show is] in the middle. It's pleasant. It's fine.

The result [of the show] is a decent start on the path toward creating a universe with tremendous comedic potential. [Full review in Spanish]

Exclaim!
It may take a couple season for The Paper to truly find its groove, but it's off to a ripping start already.

It’s a shame that The Paper strains itself so hard to be silly because there’s things here that work to varying degrees. Ironically, it’s when the series is content with its moments of quiet hopefulness that its potential begins to shine.

Such a charming show! Love the characters so much and I’m looking forward to a season 2 immensely! I think the only reason there are lower than expected audience reviews are because some people are expecting this to be The Office 2 or something lmao

I enjoyed this show immensely. It's not as loose as The Office, but the characters are appealingly earnest and oddball enough that I quickly felt like I became part of their "family". Domhnall Gleeson is infinitely charming, as is Chelsea Frei, and Sabrina Impacciatore plays a cringe-inspiring fireball who allows you to see the pathos behind her facade in a fascinating way. But all the characters are worth watching. I can't wait for season 2 (as I see that it's already been renewed—yay!).

This show is infuriating! Esmeralda is disgusting and not funny in ANY way. They try to hard to make it like The Office, but the hilarity in the ineptitude does not transfer and it does not have the same chemistry. This show had soooo much promise but I just find myself so irritated with a couple of the characters. Writers don’t know how to build punch lines anymore.

As an office die hard, and a lover of parks and rec, The Paper is a pleasant blend of the two. With original characters, dry humor, and call backs to the OG.
