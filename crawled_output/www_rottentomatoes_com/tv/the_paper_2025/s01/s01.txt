Graeme Blundell
The Australian
The Paper is droll enough to start, though a bit chaotic, and it will take a while for the actors to fully inhabit their roles. But then so was The Office, and look what happened to that series.

These characters and actors will win you over quickly and completely, partly because the performances are so smart and partly because the writing is, too.

They don't do a lot of direct referencing of The Office...But...[the show is] in the middle. It's pleasant. It's fine.

For Your Reference Podcast
The Paper is aware and plays well in the climate for comedy in the 2020s that’s rooted in acknowledging conflicting realities, pairing well with its journalistic setting.
Rated: 4/5

For Your Reference Podcast
Punching above its weight, The Paper delivers characters that are both funny and lovable. A light, bingeable mockumentary full of chuckles, charm, and newsroom hijinks.
Rated: 4/5

Despite the slightly slow start, I fell in love with this show! I was missing The Office and this fills those shoes in a brilliant and entertaining way!

WOW this thing is rough. Cookie cutter characters, wooden performances, and a script even Ai wouldn't bother writing. The mocumentary premise has to be done seriously or not at all. If the characters act like they're in on the joke, it loses all its charm.

If you’ve watched The Office, The Paper will be instantly familiar.
It takes a few episodes to get going, and isn’t back to back laughs like The Office, but the cast are strong and the story is already well defined - I already want to follow the story for years to see where it goes.
An easy, humorous and most importantly - relatable -watch.

People tend to forget how absolutely lost and inept that first season of The Office was. Pam was hopeless, Jim was a smug pretty boy, Dwight was incorrigible, and Michael was quite possibly the most unlikeable character on television at the time. Taking off those rose-tinted glasses, it was a miracle The Office took off the way it did - and it did, gloriously. While The Paper stumbles a bit out the door, there's something here. Something much more hopeful, less cynical than its predecessor. An underdog story worth cheering for. Esmerelda and Ken being the perfect amalgamation of both Michael Scott and David Brent - smug, obnoxious, and a complete lack of self-awareness. However, there's a charm and spirit to how they both operate in tandem to Domhnall Gleeson's Ned, who gives a fine performance as the true hero of the story. There's a color in his eyes that shines beyond the painfully hopelessness of this decaying industry, and it's there where the story begins to take shape. You really want to root for these players, hoping they somehow manage the impossible. All of them operating from within his tiny little pocket of hope that elevates the story, and moves it forward. This is a much charming and light-heated affair, even though it may take a while to really begin to power through. Well worth the watch.

I really wanted this to be good.
I loved The Office.
I really wanted this to be better than St. Denis Medical.
I hate St. Denis Medical.
I think St. Denis Medical might be better than this.
There is so much potential here, but it's just.
not.
working.
Not a single laugh.
Sometimes we can barely determine what they're talking about or why whatever they're talking about is supposed to be funny.
The former White Lotus actress is absoulutely horrible - her character doesn't even make any sense - like, why is she there?
Are they going for Sophia Vergara on Modern Family?
She was very funny - this lady is NOT.
The one actual link to The Office (other than the documentary premise) - Oscar?
Embarrassingly awful, past his comedic prime, and has terrible lines to deal with.
Domhnall?
Bombnall.
And the other characters?
Wait...are there actually other characters?
Oh yeah, there's a few of them.
I think.
Don't really know or care about any of them.
Sorry - my wife and I have watched at least 3 or 4 episodes and it does not improve AT ALL!
Boo.
