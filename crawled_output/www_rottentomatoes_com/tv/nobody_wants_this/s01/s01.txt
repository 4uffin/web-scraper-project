What to Know
Critics Consensus
Contrary to its title, Nobody Wants This proves to be a welcome binge thanks to Kristen Bell and Adam Brody's irresistible chemistry and some thoughtful considerations of interfaith romance.

This is a winning rom-com, with witty dialogue and crackling chemistry between Brody and Bell.

New York Times
If the show’s understanding of Judaism seems mean and shallow, that’s probably because its true religion is the holy algorithm, its episodes preordained to be even more irresistible than illicit prosciutto.

NPR
It's easy to imagine Nobody Wants This emerging rapidly as the rom-com standard for a new age. It's sweet, but it's sharp. It has laughs but also has bite.

The Mary Sue
With its crackling chemistry, bantering meet-cute, and modern dating woes, Nobody Wants This, is pretty darn close to what we want from our rom-com fix.

Nobody Wants This grounds itself in the reality of two different people wanting to make their romance work, and questioning if, in this case, love really is enough.

Sonsidering that we’ve seen it before with the Jewish heartthrob and adorable blonde of a previous generation, Nobody Wants This works unexpectedly well.

We really loved this. It's funny, sassy, different, clever, quirky.
It's great to see kind of a familiar story (forbidden love, people falling for people they shouldn't/ wouldn't normally) that is done in such a different way.
It's heart warming, funny, unexpected, engaging, never dull. Every character brings something to it.
I've seen a few reviews online saying how unrealistic it is. But it's TV. It's a comedy. It's not a documentary. I'm sure The Office isn't that realistic in parts. Stop taking yourselves so seriously and just enjoy a laugh. Because this is a real good, heart warming laugh.
Can't wait for series 2.

When I watched the first episode of Nobody Wants This, I really didn't like it. But for some reason I wanted to know what happened next so I watched a few more episodes and it really did grow on me. It was a fun and very enjoyable show with great leads, good writing, and mostly very funny. The leads are definitely a highlight. Kristen Bell and Adam Brody were both very charming. And Timothy Simons, who I enjoyed very much on VEEP, was absolutely hilarious. Though I don't think there's too much special here in the actual filmmaking, I did enjoy the plot complexities in the writing towards the end and it was pretty well shot. But even though it's not really great by most means, I still thought this season was extremely enjoyable and I always was looking forward to coming back to it.
