Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but itâ€™s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

Didnâ€™t think much of the first half of season one - really not my thing, yet for some mindless reason I persevered and by season two Iâ€™m utterly hooked - itâ€™s brilliant- on par with â€˜breaking badâ€™. One must persevere with it to understand season two - then you will be rewarded with unexpected twists, wonderful script writing and character development, humour, just great, I promise. So good Iâ€™ve made the effort to sign up to this, first time ever, just to rate it. Itâ€™s great.

I donâ€™t know how anyone can watch this. You got to have the brains of ðŸ’©. The acting is horrible, characters are dumb, storyline is dumb, I had to shut it off. I actually feel dumber watching it and Iâ€™ve sat through so pretty dumb shows and movies

The story is engaging and keeps you wanting every episode to come. Characters are well written and clear. The dialog between characters is so drawn out and repetitive. I would give it 5 stars otherwise.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this series! From the beginning of Season 1..now i wasn't exactly thrilled with just 8 episodes in Season 2 but its all good! I am loving the turn around for Kimmie LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I AM hoping and praying that Horace makes a remarkable recovery i wanna see him and Kimmie take ALL of them down... now however, i CANNOT WAIT for Norman to find out that Mallory is the one responsible for his wife's death OMG!!! WHEEEWWWW I cant wait for the new episodes i Love Tyler Perry
