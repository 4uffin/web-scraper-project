Beauty in Black is not prestige TV, but itâ€™s a frothy and twisted soap that you might find yourself bingeing.

I donâ€™t know how anyone can watch this. You got to have the brains of ðŸ’©. The acting is horrible, characters are dumb, storyline is dumb, I had to shut it off. I actually feel dumber watching it and Iâ€™ve sat through so pretty dumb shows and movies

The story is engaging and keeps you wanting every episode to come. Characters are well written and clear. The dialog between characters is so drawn out and repetitive. I would give it 5 stars otherwise.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this series! From the beginning of Season 1..now i wasn't exactly thrilled with just 8 episodes in Season 2 but its all good! I am loving the turn around for Kimmie LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I AM hoping and praying that Horace makes a remarkable recovery i wanna see him and Kimmie take ALL of them down... now however, i CANNOT WAIT for Norman to find out that Mallory is the one responsible for his wife's death OMG!!! WHEEEWWWW I cant wait for the new episodes i Love Tyler Perry
