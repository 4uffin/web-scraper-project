What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The series’ first season was too committed to childish things to allow the franchise to grow up.

As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

The Show is a like a Olympic runner
Starts off fast and good then gets
tired and stale near the end of the series
But so far a head of the other runners makes it too the finish line

The best thing I can say about this show is that it wasn't as bad as Alien Resurrection. It was about as good as Alien 3... maybe. I was never once scared, any tension that was intended was lost after the 5th or 6th time a Xenomorph faced someone down in striking distance but for no explainable reason leaves the person alone. This wasn't a xenomorph story primarily (not even secondarily), it was all about synths and hybrids and just happened to include aliens. Even then, it barely scratched the surface of any profound reflections on the hybrids. A show that went way deeper was Westworld, so why sideline the aliens for this topic if it's already been done before?
I was also disappointed at how under-utilized Alex Lawther was in the show, what a waste of talent. Good performance from the guy who played Boy Kavalier, but he was poorly written.
*SPOILERS*
The last line in the finale, "Now we rule", is so dumb, doesn't pay off anything, and, again, demonstrated that they had zero interest in using the xenomorphs, this whole show was about the robots.
One other thought... did they ever explain why Wendy had these superpowers but not the other children? Also, it was so stupid to give her the ability to speak to the aliens and control them, just another way to rob them of how terrifying they should be. And just when I was starting to like Arthur (really the only character I liked) they freaking killed him off. Oh, and did we ever learn Morrow's motivations for what he did on the Maginot? That was really murky.

I had a lot of hope at the start, the production values are high. But this feels like a serious version of Idiocracy where the smartest ppl in earth act without a hint of sense or instinct for self preservation or a consistent morality. All the scientists drinking from open containers, sharing the same air as creatures they know are murderous. I'm at episode 7, (spoilers) and just watched Wendy release her pet alien to kill a bunch of ppl so she can escape. That's her character? When did she stop valuing human life? The comments you're trying to make on greed or hubris carry no weight if you're characters aren't remotely human.

I don't understand anyone that didn't like this show. It's brilliantly paced, the story is excellent and it looks stunning. If there isn't a 2nd season then we only have ourselves to blame.

Abby W.
The set design is great, the actors who play Wendy and Prodigy are very good, but the plot has a lot of holes and just isn’t very compelling. They needed to do more with focusing on the business rivalries. The adults acting as children the whole season gets really tired. The season finale was pretty predictable and answered no questions.
