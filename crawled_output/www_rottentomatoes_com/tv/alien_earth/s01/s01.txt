What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The New Republic
As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

ABC Radio (Australia)
The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

Initially promising in some ways, let down by dumber and dumber writing.

The first episode was alright. It laid some groundwork. But then it just got dumber and dumber each week. I bailed after 4. Don't waste your time like I did.

The show is everywhere and doesn't make sense to many plots going on at once then there are scenes that don't make any sense at all like the wendy scene where she talks to nibs about the baby and then she says that 5 times but you do remember the baby right the baby right the baby like where is the writing at because it's not there?
Another franchise ruined to trillion dollar company.Just like the t v show has further trillion dollars companys doing what ever they want showing how much of tyrants they are with that much money

Really disappointing. Convoluted story with minimal Alien dred that the franchise is known for. Again another prequel with more advanced Tec compared to the original. And a strange acceptance that putting a child mind in advanced bodies will be totally fine and they can do everything is emerson breaking. Rarely felt like it was based in the alien universe, predator would have a field day with these corporations.

Uninspired metaphors and jumpscares, cheap filmmaking with poorly sequenced actions and slowmo ala AvP, non-scary xenomorphs shown in plain light vs powercreeped androids hmm i wonder where the stakes are..
Exit the claustrophobia, the mythology of the creature and all it's PG thematics since this show is only thought as derivative content, Hawley doesn't seem to care if he sabotages the original material.
Half a point for the bottle sequence.
