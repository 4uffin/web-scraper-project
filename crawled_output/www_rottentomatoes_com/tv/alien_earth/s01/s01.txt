Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The series’ first season was too committed to childish things to allow the franchise to grow up.

As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Disney does it again, they milked a franchise for the sake of money. This was a promising show, and it built a mini universe that seemed interesting, the criticism surrounding the cannon was not that relevant, but for a whom season they teased at monsters that barely had any relevance, also the ending just was the last straw since it wasted most of the character development and basically made you believe some things would happen just to keep you at the edge of your seat, while some of the behavior of the characters can be explained it still doesn’t make any sense, add that to the expressed intentions of some of them that just never seem to happen like getting rid of other characters. I try to explain without spoilers but it’s just really really bad, not worth any time watching it, it did it now and it will do it again they’re gonna milk the show leaving all kinds of cliffhangers just to keep having more seasons.
DO NOT WATCH

The writing is next level. Anyone who gave this show a negative review is probably to dense to understand the symbolism and deeper meaning.

Its not a bad season 1 of a horror series with oogy aliens. In fact, its not bad at all on that level.
HOWEVER it is a god awful show in the Alien universe that doesn't have a season 2 greenlit or written. If this show doesnt get a season 2 then this was the biggest waste of viewing time in a long while. Firstly the Alien in the form of a person in a costume was low rent even in the 1979 movie, and thats all we get here. Secondly, the Alien is in like 15 minutes of the SEASON with 10 of those minutes in the first episode.
Third, there are so many loose ties that it seems like they wanted another episode but ran out of time or money to make it. It totally half baked as an Alien spin-off. For that reason, I cant recommend it.
