What to Know
Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The New Republic
As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

I love this series. Sometimes scary (though I'm not the best judge, as I get scared easily) and a good story, with some new monsters. Of course, there are a few inconsistencies and plot holes, but nothing so bad that it detracts from my viewing pleasure.

Truly amazing. It grips you right from the start and doesn't let go. The characters are written with complexity and heart. The performances are awe inspiring. It's just such a great show, and a great addition to one of my all time favorite franchises. It's a high art creature feature, and wasn't that what the Alien franchise always was from the first film? This show also ratchets up the cyber punk aspect of the lore of Alien. Alien Romulus also did this, but with such little time on Earth it couldn't go too far with it, but this show could, and has. I just love this. It's as cool as it is scary. As a fan of the Alien franchise I was worried they wouldn't add anything new, that it would just be remember berries. That's clearly not the case. This is as innovative as it faithful to the core principles of the franchise. I'm so happy with the results. The only problem with this show is that it's only going to exist for one season. I WANT MORE.

As someone who is new to watching Alien content and has seen Prometheus + Alien Covenan, I think this show is fantastic! Highly recommend. Sound track, cinematography, and acting are great. Must see

On Earth, you can hear me screaming at the television that it makes no sense. A collection of painfully misguided adventures and half-baked ideas strung together by incoherent plotting and a lack of rising stakes. When the xenomorph is one of the weakest elements in your ALIEN show, you know you have a problem.

The events are not connected like when slightly took Arthur and the alien got of from Arthur face how did slightly know that the alien is inside he is clearly a child not knowing what is going on there is a lot of things going on that doesn't make any sense
the alien which is the whole show is about it is poorly motion it looks like an alien with disability
you guys need to do better in S2 make the story connected and makes sense and bring back the alien we used to know scary ruthless

I'm a huge Alien franchise fan so it'll take a lot to make me not like something. Like Alien 3, that was pretty awful. This series is definitely not that bad, it started off interesting then got bogged down in the classic SF-ey stuff but it's not over yet so I'll reserve final judgement when all episodes have aired. So far there have been too many plot holes, weird twists and cookie cutter sequences but maybe there's an interesting ending or cliff hanger in store, we'll see.
