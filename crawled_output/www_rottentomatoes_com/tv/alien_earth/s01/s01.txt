Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The New Republic
As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

The action and the visuals are first class, and the special effects are a clever mixture of the latest in computer-generated imagery and the old-fashioned type of practical effects used back in the early "Alien" days.

ABC Radio (Australia)
The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

Radio Times
It's a series that has a lot on its mind, a host of compelling characters, and a willingness to down some offbeat avenues, all while delivering the chills and thrills that Alien fans expect.
Rated: 4/5

O que mais chama a atenção é a maneira como a série expande o universo original. Eles não se limitam a seguir o que já existia, mas criam novas ideias que tornam a história ainda mais rica e interessante. É o tipo de produção que faz você querer saber mais sobre esse mundo.
A qualidade é inegável. A produção é muito bem feita, os efeitos visuais são ótimos e o visual da série é instigante. As atuações também são um ponto forte, com o elenco entregando performances que fazem você acreditar nos personagens e na história.
A série é bastante divertida e viciante, daquelas que você assiste um episódio atrás do outro sem perceber. É uma ótima escolha para quem quer uma história envolvente e visualmente impressionante. Estou ansiosa para ver o que eles vão mostrar a seguir.

Loving every minute of Alien: Earth.
Can't wait for the finale.
Be prepared for a huge expansion of the Alien universe.
This will become a classic.

First thing to do, Google who owns Rotten Tomatoes, then you'll know why the ratings are the way they are.
This show is extremely bad, the acting is horrible, the story us full of holes, the direction is non-existent, there is no atmosphere, there is no cohesion, no character depth, it's just a mess, probably written by chatGPT.
I was looking forward to this show but unfortunately it is just really really bad.
They can lie all they want on their ratings, if you don't believe me, watch the show and see for yourself.
Don't think there will be Season 2.
