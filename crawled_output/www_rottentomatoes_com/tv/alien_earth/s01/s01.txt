Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and scary as hell, Noah Hawley's Alien: Earth transplants the Xenomorph mythos into the television medium with its cinematic grandeur intact while staking out a unique identity of its own.

The series’ first season was too committed to childish things to allow the franchise to grow up.

As this new show hurtled by, I felt the visceral excitement of its creator, the explosion of his ideas, his genuine love for the material.

It’s a big show about big ideas, expansive in a moment when most television is scaling back, and it’s got a whole universe to explore.

...this is the most 'Alien' thing we've seen in the 'Alien' saga since... 'Alien'. [Full review in Spanish]

The editing, the photography, the way it intercuts different scenes, I’ve never really seen in television before – and I’m excited, because the Alien franchise was churning its wheels without really going anywhere. Alien: Earth might be the game-changer.

I love the world that this show has built and its conflicts. The character dynamics are great and the creatures are terrific! Just wish that the final was a bit better.

IT actually gave me hope to begin with, but then only episode 5 was worth the watch. that ending....wth was that even...If you love Aliens franchise then i dont recommend this only watch episode five and then move on. Sorry but this was a huuuuge swing and miss that ive seen in a long while. so many things makes zero sense and why focus on the kids instead of the ALIENS!

A pretty interesting first episode only gets your hopes up for a what is sadly a hugely disappointing series. From terrible a actor who was only cast because their brother is the producer, to poorly written dialogue that doesn't fit the character delivering the lines.
Non sensical decision making by characters because the writers were too lazy or bad to think of a way to arrive at the same plot in a way that made any sense. It's one redeeming feature is that Timothy Olyphant is excellent.

Excellent pacing!
It holds the spirit of the films and has the right amount of tension and suspense , as well as compelling characters and
development arcs, and doesn’t feel like a jump-scare cash-grab.

One of the stupidest show on television. This actually makes the writing in Alien Covenant seem smart. Everyone is unlikable, boring plots and a lot of bad acting.
