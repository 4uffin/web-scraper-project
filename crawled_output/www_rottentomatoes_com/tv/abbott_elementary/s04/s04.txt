A group of dedicated, passionate teachers -- and a slightly tone-deaf principal -- find themselves thrown together in a Philadelphia public school where, despite the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed in life. Though these incredible public servants may be outnumbered and underfunded, they love what they do -- even if they don't love the school district's less-than-stellar attitude toward educating children.

Like any show, “Abbott” occasionally has missteps, but it’s maintained a strong sense of who its characters are and the core of the story it’s telling about them.

The fact that Abbott Elementary is willing to wade into this class politics discussion with a hopeful smile on its face and loses none of its glee is an accomplishment.

It’s rare for a comedy to continue delivering one hit season after another, yet Abbott Elementary Season 4 proves that the workplace mockumentary is a gem worth having on our screens for a long, long time.

Abbott Elementary is a rare gift of a show that has only improved as the series goes on—giving us plenty of opportunities to tear up over its sweetness and cackle at the absurdity of the lovable cast of characters and their daily adventures at school.

It would seem that, along with not getting much in the way of rest, Brunson has also maintained a firm handle on the show’s quality at a time when it would be easy to let the crew take their collective foot off the gas.

abbott is back in session and this one was a rollercoaster! from bribery to suspension to barbara being a hundred years old, this season keeps up with the lives of these teachers and make my days a little brighter. it’s amazing to see them interact with each other, face the problems as a dysfunctional team and get together for the really important moments as a family! there were guinea pigs, ava, karaoke, ava, the district, ava, and did i mention ava??! truly one of the best characters ever created. can’t wait to see where life takes us in season five!!!!!
