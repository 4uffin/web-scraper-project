prawnda s
john is one of the only remaining mainstream american journalists willing to directly confront modern issues. to see that there's only one other review here and it's complaining that he's leaned entirely left (he always did that) is a bit disappointing, but i'm going to blame rotten tomatoes for the issue since they seem to have driven all human users away years ago, much the same as the current corporate and political regime has driven most americans away from anything resembling critical thinking.
PROBLEMS: significant delays in release schedule or even inconsistent platform of release, basically 100% because of warner bros screwing john over at every opportunity. as of the time of writing this, john has gone 2 weeks without an episode or an explanation of why, when we have some very serious things to discuss. one can assume this is in part because of colbert being cancelled. this happens far too often without any update on when the next episodes are coming, leading to a confused mix of information online which claims the last two episodes released on schedule, yet they are not on streaming, live tv, or youtube.

I used to enjoy John Oliver's left-leaning slant on things - when he tackled some real issues with humor- but over the past few seasons his combination of running out of real issues to focus on and going full left makes him completely out of alignment with the vast majority of viewers.
