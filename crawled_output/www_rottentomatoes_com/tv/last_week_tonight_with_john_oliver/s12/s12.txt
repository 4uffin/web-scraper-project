john is possibly one of the only remaining mainstream american journalists willing to directly confront modern issues. to see that there's only one other review here and it's complaining that he's leaned entirely left (he always did that) is a bit disappointing, but i'm going to blame rotten tomatoes for the issue since they seem to have driven all human users away years ago, much the same as the current corporate and political regime has driven most americans away from anything resembling critical thinking.

I used to enjoy John Oliver's left-leaning slant on things - when he tackled some real issues with humor- but over the past few seasons his combination of running out of real issues to focus on and going full left makes him completely out of alignment with the vast majority of viewers.
