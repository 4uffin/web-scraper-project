It gets better each time. Fall in love again and again. The declarations of love, more wrought. The crashing waves in the background, more violent.

The acting is capable and the writing is fine. The perspective is what’s special, as it respects what is small and yet sacred about life. It’s something that children need to learn and that adults are, it turns out, relieved to remember.

The Summer I Turned Pretty may not be riveting in the traditional sense, but it is dangerously watchable. Sometimes, pretty faces and pretty problems are enough.

All the Bonrad moments are top-notch, and that’s reason enough for most to tune in; I just wish the path getting there was less cobbled.

There is something so fiery about this season, which is that I think they're landing the plane. I like [Belly] going to Paris. I like what's happening.

Season 3 is the weakest of all the Seasons to me. It starts out pretty good, but the whole "cheating", car accident, and then Conrad skulking around trying to ruin his brother's relationship is just ridiculous.
Inconsistent writing, stories that are not cohesive. Some acting choices by certain broody people could be better.
Not sure how the endgame couple is endgame considering the lead male charcter acts like Eeyore throughout most of the season.
He was better when he was sassy. The finale was rushed, and the story just didn't make much sense.
I'm sure the movie will just be more hot mess.

First of all I don't think so this thing is for everyone but when you start watching this series and you feel something that's keeps you going , in the end this series become one of my favourite so as always team Conrad.

I think we need more rom-coms and romance/dramas, so I feel bad about leaving a bad review on this one. But the whole show was kind of ridiculous. Neither brother respected each other, and Belly definitely did not respect them. She was pretty selfish. Jerking around Jeremiah the entire series. She should have ended up with Jeremiah, he had so many green flags. He messed up once, they were on a break, a lot of men deal with their pain that way. She and Conrad just had a toxic attachment.
