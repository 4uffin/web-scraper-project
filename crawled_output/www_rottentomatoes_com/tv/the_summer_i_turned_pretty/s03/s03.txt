It gets better each time. Fall in love again and again. The declarations of love, more wrought. The crashing waves in the background, more violent.

The acting is capable and the writing is fine. The perspective is what’s special, as it respects what is small and yet sacred about life. It’s something that children need to learn and that adults are, it turns out, relieved to remember.

There is something so fiery about this season, which is that I think they're landing the plane. I like [Belly] going to Paris. I like what's happening.

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
The going out, seeing the world, meeting other people, becoming your own person has been really missing for so much of the show. And it's so refreshing that we finally are getting to see that.

Belly’s feelings and experiences are never treated as melodrama. Her anger and grief at the discovery of Jeremiah’s infidelity isn’t played up for laughs, nor is her constant pining for the better brother made into something ridiculous

Snooze R
Firstly, the writing is weak and undeserving of its viewership or inflated rating. Much of its praise feels biased, likely boosted by a younger demographic that mistakes cliché drama for meaningful storytelling. When Jenny Han says, “We put our whole hearts into this show…”, it’s almost laughable — as if this shallow script truly represents their best effort.
The acting only makes things worse. Performances are stiff and unconvincing, turning even supposedly emotional moments into cringe. It’s impossible to take the show seriously when both the dialogue and delivery feel so flat.
Now, let’s talk about the storyline and characters. Belly, who admits toward the end that she’s the “villain,” is exactly that — shallow, selfish, and perpetually playing the victim. She lacks integrity, constantly dramatizes situations, and moves from one relationship to the next without shame or accountability. Even when she confesses she’s the problem, she never truly apologizes, and Conrad conveniently reassures her otherwise. Instead of growth, the show surrounds her with enablers who excuse her behavior.
Conrad, while one of the more tolerable characters, is still pathetic in his own right. He wallows in self-pity and clings to a high school relationship for five years as though it were some grand romance. It’s absurd to see him and Jeremiah fighting over someone as shallow as Belly — especially when Jeremiah is supposed to be his brother. Jeremiah at least shows a sliver of character development by the end, though it’s rushed like everything else.
As for the side characters, they’re either irrelevant or toxic. Steven and Taylor are slightly more watchable, but their behavior is just as messy and enabling. The adults barely register as important, and Laura in particular adds little beyond supporting Belly’s delusion.
By the finale, Belly ends up happy with Conrad despite being the most insufferable character on screen. We’re expected to root for her after everything, but the payoff feels hollow, unrealistic, and forced. Instead of delivering the emotional weight Jenny Han was aiming for, the show leaves behind only frustration — or in my case, disgust.
In conclusion: The Summer I Turned Pretty rewards self-centeredness and victimhood while disguising it as “following your heart.” If this is meant to be romantic, I’d rather pass. Don’t waste your time.

I’m by no means a fan of most romance stories because I feel like most of them tend to set unrealistic expectations for real life but somehow this show has gotten me in a chokehold since it returned. Every week, I found myself watching and just interacting with everything happening and the final episode of the series sticks the landing. It’s very romantic, very satisfying and sets up the events of the movie that was announced.

The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3 is a show that everyone is talking about, and for good reason—it’s one of those can’t-look-away entertaining disasters. The central plot is so ridiculous yet compelling that it makes the whole thing fun to watch. Chris Briney and Lola Tung shine, making Conrad and Belly’s story genuinely excellent. That said, the side characters drag the story down and the pacing feels questionable, but overall it’s still a fun time.
