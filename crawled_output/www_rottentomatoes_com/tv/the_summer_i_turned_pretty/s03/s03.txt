It gets better each time. Fall in love again and again. The declarations of love, more wrought. The crashing waves in the background, more violent.

Romcoms aren’t made like they used to be

The acting is capable and the writing is fine. The perspective is what’s special, as it respects what is small and yet sacred about life. It’s something that children need to learn and that adults are, it turns out, relieved to remember.

There is something so fiery about this season, which is that I think they're landing the plane. I like [Belly] going to Paris. I like what's happening.

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
The going out, seeing the world, meeting other people, becoming your own person has been really missing for so much of the show. And it's so refreshing that we finally are getting to see that.

Belly’s feelings and experiences are never treated as melodrama. Her anger and grief at the discovery of Jeremiah’s infidelity isn’t played up for laughs, nor is her constant pining for the better brother made into something ridiculous

I think we need more rom-coms and romance/dramas, so I feel bad about leaving a bad review on this one. But the whole show was kind of ridiculous. Neither brother respected each other, and Belly definitely did not respect them. She was pretty selfish. Jerking around Jeremiah the entire series. She should have ended up with Jeremiah, he had so many green flags. He messed up once, they were on a break, a lot of men deal with their pain that way. She and Conrad just had a toxic attachment.

Snooze R
Firstly, the writing is weak and undeserving of its viewership or inflated rating. Much of its praise feels biased, likely boosted by a younger demographic that mistakes cliché drama for meaningful storytelling. When Jenny Han says, “We put our whole hearts into this show…”, it’s almost laughable — as if this shallow script truly represents their best effort.
The acting only makes things worse. Performances are stiff and unconvincing, turning even supposedly emotional moments into cringe. It’s impossible to take the show seriously when both the dialogue and delivery feel so flat.
Now, let’s talk about the storyline and characters. Belly, who admits toward the end that she’s the “villain,” is exactly that — shallow, selfish, and perpetually playing the victim. She lacks integrity, constantly dramatizes situations, and moves from one relationship to the next without shame or accountability. Even when she confesses she’s the problem, she never truly apologizes, and Conrad conveniently reassures her otherwise. Instead of growth, the show surrounds her with enablers who excuse her behavior.
Conrad, while one of the more tolerable characters, is still pathetic in his own right. He wallows in self-pity and clings to a high school relationship for five years as though it were some grand romance. It’s absurd to see him and Jeremiah fighting over someone as shallow as Belly — especially when Jeremiah is supposed to be his brother. Jeremiah at least shows a sliver of character development by the end, though it’s rushed like everything else.
As for the side characters, they’re either irrelevant or toxic. Steven and Taylor are slightly more watchable, but their behavior is just as messy and enabling. The adults barely register as important, and Laura in particular adds little beyond supporting Belly’s delusion.
By the finale, Belly ends up happy with Conrad despite being the most insufferable character on screen. We’re expected to root for her after everything, but the payoff feels hollow, unrealistic, and forced. Instead of delivering the emotional weight Jenny Han was aiming for, the show leaves behind only frustration — or in my case, disgust.
In conclusion: The Summer I Turned Pretty rewards self-centeredness and victimhood while disguising it as “following your heart.” If this is meant to be romantic, I’d rather pass. Don’t waste your time.
