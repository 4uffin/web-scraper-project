What to Know
Critics Consensus
Platonic is easy to love in a sophomore season that continues to expertly leverage Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen's explosively charming chemistry.

The Times (UK)
Platonic, for all its goofier escapades and people getting high (because it is Seth Rogen), is rather sophisticated in its exploration of relationship boundaries...
Rated: 4/5

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
This show is a bunch of people hanging out in different groups, people who are really good and funny. Some of it's physical comedy, some of it's verbal comedy. It's a really nice deployment of a bunch of different kinds of comedic chemistry.

Its easiness can be deceptive, though, and part of its appeal is that underneath those madcap antics, there is real warmth and heart.
Rated: 4/5

It’s clear Season 2 didn’t lose its edge. The show is still dumb in the smartest way, a cringe comedy with real emotional stakes hiding just under the surface.
Rated: A-

Pop Culture Happy Hour (NPR Podcast)
Out of everything that's going on, it's very low stakes. And I really admired that about it because it's just fun. It's silly.

If you were at all on the fence after the first season, know that Season 2 of Platonic has officially found its footing.

Simply annoying. Both main actors are annoying and not at all funny. Couldn’t bear more than 1 1/2 episodes
