Ballard continues to bring Michael Connelly's bestselling novels to life, following Detective Renée Ballard (Q) as she leads the LAPD's new and underfunded cold case division, tackling the city’s most challenging long-forgotten crimes with empathy and relentless determination. As she peels back layers of crimes spanning decades, including a serial killer's string of murders and a murdered John Doe, she soon uncovers a dangerous conspiracy within the LAPD. With the help of her volunteer team and retired detective Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), Detective Ballard navigates personal trauma, professional challenges, and life-threatening dangers to expose the truth.

Critics Consensus
A crisp procedural with a magnetic lead in Maggie Q, Ballard is a worthy sibling series to Bosch that comes with its own unique strengths.

Graeme Blundell
The Australian
Connelly’s LA is a kind of fabricated city, many fragments representing the whole, forming the right setting for stories of such psychological focus, private obsession, and trauma.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
With six Ballard novels to call on, the series is a sturdy procedural, complete with Bosch-friendly cameos, that is trying to very carefully grapple with institutional failings while maintaining a run-and-gun cop show momentum.
Rated: 3/5

Smartly acted, beautifully paced and genuinely engaging, “Ballard” is a thrilling ride from start to finish.

Mac the Movie Guy
This Bosch spinoff is another commendation for Michael Connelly whose works continue to translate well across streamers. Maggie Q feels fully prepared for this, and John Carroll lynch is a standout among the supporting cast.
Rated: 73/100

Alex Maidy
JoBlo's Movie Network
A decent summer series, and like the books it is based on, it is a light and easy watch reminiscent of the novels quickly absorbed during days at the beach. While it may not stick with you in the long run, Ballard is a fun ride while you are on it.
Rated: 6/10

Digital Mafia Talkies
Ballard’s success lies in its simplicity. Instead of a stylized detective show, the creators chose a very ‘no-nonsense’ style of storytelling, and that complements the complex cases that we watch unfold on-screen.

Ballard is terrific. It’s a morally complex thriller/police procedural in the Bosch tradition, but overall casting is better. In the Bosch series, Maddie Bosch and Honey Chandler were not up to Titus Welliver’s standard. Every single cast member of Ballard is perfect, starting with Maggie Q. Can’t wait for Season 2.

I would seem RP doesn't like negative reviews, I spent 30 min writing one, only to get a "seems something went wrong" . But I had partial copy.
Connelly is now on par with Harlan Coben and James Patterson in terms of proficiency. Procrastination has become a recurring topic in his most recent writings. Bosch has changed into a sour old man who should have retired a decade ago. Connelly created other characters along the road, such as McEvoy and McCaleb, these characters had brief book lives. However, Connelly chose to add Mike Haller, whose series is, to put it simply, lacks credibility. Evidence is "dropped from God at the right time" to help Haller win his legal battles.
Haller and Bosch are now stepbrothers, and I have no doubt that Ballard, Terry McCaleb, and Jack McEvoy are all linked to Bosch. In light of how ridiculous Connelly's writing has become, I won't be shocked if Ballard is the daughter of all four men. The Ballard TV series seems to me to be a waste of time and resources because it just a rehash of “cold case” TV series, which Bosch transitioned to after he retired and became whiny. Economics has a rule of "diminishing returns", which simply put is - by the 10th helping most things are just boring and have zero value.
Although I can appreciate the pressure to stay current, actors and authors reach their zenith in their careers and then gently transition into that wonderful life when it's time to retire. Playing the part Vito Corleone at the age of 47 should have been Marlon Brando's pinnacle movie, but he probably kept doing it for financial reasons. His subsequent work was awful. That point was exceeded by Michael Connelly in 2009.

Coming in on the heels of Bosch, this sister show carries the grit and determination of dedicated law enforcement officers along quite well.
That it follows the stories in the book series doesn't detract at all from what is displayed onscreen.
It is also quite comforting to see Bosch make an appearance here and there, along with other characters such as J Edgar and Crate and Barrel.
This first season is easily of higher quality than much of the other dreck being pushed out by the studios these days.

A series that markets itself as layered crime drama but is in fact nothing more than a flattened custard: predictable, infantile in its spoon-feeding, and so overacted that calling it ‘acting’ feels generous. Everything is spelled out, leaving no room for the viewer to think for themselves. A horror show for anyone who has ever experienced better cop shows.

MUST SEE! A weary detective returns to his Gulf Coast hometown, hoping to escape his past. Instead, he’s pulled into a web of crimes that threaten to unravel both the town’s secrets and his own.

Maggie Q en lead d'une série ? Évidemment que je regarde ! Certes le démarrage est un peu lent, mais une fois lancée, l'intrigue pousse à binge-watcher la série ! J'ai beaucoup après apprécié la cohésion entre l'équipe des cold cases et je n'ai qu'une chose à dire : j'espère que la série sera renouvelée pour une seconde saison !
