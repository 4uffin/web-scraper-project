Daily Telegraph (UK)
The Crow Girl, a series that mistakes earnestness for significance and desolation for insight. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
Rated: 2/5

Guardian
A very well-made, pacy drama whose overall confidence, style and authenticity carry it over the odd clunking line.
Rated: 4/5

Independent (UK)
A thriller illuminated by the reliably likeable Myles but not afraid to get much darker than the average streaming whodunit.
Rated: 4/5

We’re a bit wary that all the stories the first episode of The Crow Girl introduces won’t come together, and it’s a tonally inconsistent episode. But we’re also going to keep watching, mainly because of the potential twists and turns.

For fans of more pessimistic and dark detective material, The Crow Girl is easily a worthwhile watch; you'll just want to take a long, cleansing shower by the end of it.
Rated: 7/10

When the separate threads start to weave together in the final half of the series, you may be ahead of some revelations, depending on how literate you are in the genre, but the writer’s command of the story remains impressive.
Rated: 4/5

Inappropriate sexual dialogue from teens. Too much bouncing around without explanation. The lead detectives had a decent chemistry, but the artist husband/father in law scenes seemed ridiculous.

By the end it had become ludicrous. It was evident from the outset that Sophia could never be an accredited psychotherapist. Even worse was having the same character represented by three separate actresses, two of them in the same timeframe. This sort of thing can work quite well in prose when characters are created in the mind's eye, but it's a disaster on screen when the audience is told to retrospectively deny what they've already been shown. Bullshit!

Mwah. Interesting at times, but never really came to full depth. The added ‘humour’ was cringe, and the last episode felt unfulfilling.

Cliche ridden and clunky dialog, characters were so flat I couldn’t really believe it.

Why the h.. couldn’t they just have concentrated on the crimes committed, and stayed the f.. away from the «psychology». It’s just plain stupid.
And beside that: no cliche remained untouched.

Hooked from the very beginning, it’s been so long since something like this was made. Kept me guessing, on the edge of my seat and constantly wanting more. The ending… WELL!!… let’s just say… who doesn’t hate, how much they love being left waiting for the next series so much!!
