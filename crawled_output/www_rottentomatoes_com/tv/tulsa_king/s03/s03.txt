You’re there to watch Stallone put on a double-breasted suit, smoke a cigar, and complain about millennials and their namby-pamby electric cars … As long as the show nails that core appeal, 'Tulsa King' remains watchable.

...despite the obvious inspirations, the character of Dwight Manfredi maintains his Stallonian essence: a mix of nobility, violence, and undeniable charisma that is the driving force of the series. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 6/10

While the main characters grow more and more accustomed to the world they're a part of, and their relationships thicken, fans will be locked into a lot of what's thrown at them.
Rated: 5/10

Tulsa King is bigger, bolder, and brasher — the best season yet. Stallone brings his trademark mumbling magnetism, balancing mob menace with sly, unexpected comedy. A crime series for the underdogs, it’s as addictive as it is criminally entertaining.
Rated: 8/10

While it's impossible to say how well everything will ultimately come together, Tulsa King Season 3 is a thoroughly tense ride nonetheless — and the best that Sheridan's series has been so far.
Rated: 8/10

Stallone should have been a gangster 20 years ago. He is a good one!

What happens when you start running out of ideas as you have all kinds of absurd episodes now. It’s become a joke. No longer worth watching.
