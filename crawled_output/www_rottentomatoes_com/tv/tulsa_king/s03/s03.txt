You’re there to watch Stallone put on a double-breasted suit, smoke a cigar, and complain about millennials and their namby-pamby electric cars … As long as the show nails that core appeal, 'Tulsa King' remains watchable.

M.N. Miller

Tulsa King is bigger, bolder, and brasher — the best season yet. Stallone brings his trademark mumbling magnetism, balancing mob menace with sly, unexpected comedy. A crime series for the underdogs, it’s as addictive as it is criminally entertaining.
Rated: 8/10

While it's impossible to say how well everything will ultimately come together, Tulsa King Season 3 is a thoroughly tense ride nonetheless — and the best that Sheridan's series has been so far.
Rated: 8/10
