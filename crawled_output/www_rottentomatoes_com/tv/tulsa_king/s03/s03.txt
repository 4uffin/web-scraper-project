Youâ€™re there to watch Stallone put on a double-breasted suit, smoke a cigar, and complain about millennials and their namby-pamby electric cars â€¦ As long as the show nails that core appeal, 'Tulsa King' remains watchable.

Tulsa King continues to be a bit cartoonish and ridiculous, with stories that are introduced and dropped with increasing frequency. But Stallone is still entertaining as Dwight, as is the crew around him, and that may be enough for this show.

...despite the obvious inspirations, the character of Dwight Manfredi maintains his Stallonian essence: a mix of nobility, violence, and undeniable charisma that is the driving force of the series. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 6/10

While the main characters grow more and more accustomed to the world they're a part of, and their relationships thicken, fans will be locked into a lot of what's thrown at them.

Tulsa King is bigger, bolder, and brasher â€” the best season yet. Stallone brings his trademark mumbling magnetism, balancing mob menace with sly, unexpected comedy. A crime series for the underdogs, itâ€™s as addictive as it is criminally entertaining.
Rated: 8/10

While it's impossible to say how well everything will ultimately come together, Tulsa King Season 3 is a thoroughly tense ride nonetheless â€” and the best that Sheridan's series has been so far.

So disappointed. Starting with...on Dwight's release..cop that explains why he is where he is...so lame. Not believable. Costume designer should be fired...ughhh all the purple mismatched outfits. Margaret...not drawing any emotion from me. What happened!!?? Different Director? All the drama emotion and intensity from last season. Gone. Should I bother to stay tuned?ðŸ˜”

Ridiculous premise. The first episode was so over-the-top implausible and cheesy that I threw in the towel. Wanted very much to like it. Do NOT understand how anyone could have been drawn into this silliness rather than being insulted by it. Dopey.

While Tulsa King is beginning to become a bit formulaic, it's still a blast to see Stallone in this role.

What happens when you start running out of ideas as you have all kinds of absurd episodes now. Itâ€™s become a joke. No longer worth watching.
