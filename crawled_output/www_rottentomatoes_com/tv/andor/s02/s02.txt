Shirley Li
The Atlantic
The show held on to the franchise‚Äôs core idea that there exists in the universe a constant tension between good and evil. But it boldly interrogated the origins of that dichotomy, focusing on what pushes someone to adopt one set of beliefs over another.

Making Cassian the main focus would obscure the show‚Äôs larger point about free societies being hustled off a cliff by mass complacency, facilitated by falsehoods.

TheWrap
An ambitious, spectacular, poignant, emotionally crushing and very timely season that not only cements this show as the best ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù story, but also one of the best TV shows of the decade.

Diego Luna‚Äôs ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù is at its best when it‚Äôs critiquing authoritarianism, reflecting and skewering today‚Äôs MAGA politics.

This is ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù storytelling at its most grown, grounded, and gloriously gutting.

...Andor is one of the most complex, carefully crafted television series I‚Äôve watched in many years, and other than the settings and costumes, you might forget the larger mythological context.

Complete opposite of season 1. Great acting and storytelling. Deepens the star wars lore and it‚Äôs good to see characters from movies. This season really shows what the characters had to give up or lose for the rebellion. And it makes Rogue one an even better movie.

I enjoyed it but not as much as season 2.
I felt like they decided at the end of season 1 to go in a different direction with a couple of the characters.
I was really hoping to see two characters develop their arch consistent with season 1, but that didn‚Äôt' happen.
It's still a great show but season 2 lost a little of the excitement for me.

Provides an intelligent backstory to the pre Star Wars Episode 1 period. Well cast, beautifully shot with cinema class settings, costumes and effects. Not just a great Star Wars series, but amazing series on any level. A note though that this can be more for the thinking viewer than those after a rollercoaster of action.

This is the Star Wars series I have been waiting for ever since the 1980s and the Empire Strikes Back, not just a great Star Wars TV series, but one of the best quality TV shows of the 21st century, really great

I started watching Season Two some time ago and found the first 4-5 episodes to be way too unnecessarily complicated with far too many unexplained subplots and characters that I stopped watching it out of frustration.
Dear lord but this needed some serious editing. I came back to it this past weekend while surfing for something to watch, and I have to admit that back half of the season was outstanding.
I binge watched the remaining episodes, then ended up watching ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù again with a newfound appreciation for the film.
All I can say is be patient with this one, it‚Äôs worth it in the end.
