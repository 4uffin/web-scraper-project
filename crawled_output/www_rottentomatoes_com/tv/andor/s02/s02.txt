Shirley Li
The Atlantic
The show held on to the franchise‚Äôs core idea that there exists in the universe a constant tension between good and evil. But it boldly interrogated the origins of that dichotomy, focusing on what pushes someone to adopt one set of beliefs over another.

Making Cassian the main focus would obscure the show‚Äôs larger point about free societies being hustled off a cliff by mass complacency, facilitated by falsehoods.

TheWrap
An ambitious, spectacular, poignant, emotionally crushing and very timely season that not only cements this show as the best ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù story, but also one of the best TV shows of the decade.

Diego Luna‚Äôs ‚ÄúAndor‚Äù is at its best when it‚Äôs critiquing authoritarianism, reflecting and skewering today‚Äôs MAGA politics.

This is ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù storytelling at its most grown, grounded, and gloriously gutting.

The Christian Century
...Andor is one of the most complex, carefully crafted television series I‚Äôve watched in many years, and other than the settings and costumes, you might forget the larger mythological context.

Finally, after many years, Disney got it right! I cannot understand why they insisted in ideologically driven writers for so long rather than trying to tell good stories!

This series is too good for Star Wars. Its modern day relevance is too important.

Complete opposite of season 1. Great acting and storytelling. Deepens the star wars lore and it‚Äôs good to see characters from movies. This season really shows what the characters had to give up or lose for the rebellion. And it makes Rogue one an even better movie.

I enjoyed it but not as much as season 2.
I felt like they decided at the end of season 1 to go in a different direction with a couple of the characters.
I was really hoping to see two characters develop their arch consistent with season 1, but that didn‚Äôt' happen.
It's still a great show but season 2 lost a little of the excitement for me.
