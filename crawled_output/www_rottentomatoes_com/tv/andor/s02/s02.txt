Shirley Li
The Atlantic
The show held on to the franchise’s core idea that there exists in the universe a constant tension between good and evil. But it boldly interrogated the origins of that dichotomy, focusing on what pushes someone to adopt one set of beliefs over another.

Making Cassian the main focus would obscure the show’s larger point about free societies being hustled off a cliff by mass complacency, facilitated by falsehoods.

TheWrap
An ambitious, spectacular, poignant, emotionally crushing and very timely season that not only cements this show as the best “Star Wars” story, but also one of the best TV shows of the decade.

Diego Luna’s “Andor” is at its best when it’s critiquing authoritarianism, reflecting and skewering today’s MAGA politics.

This is “Star Wars” storytelling at its most grown, grounded, and gloriously gutting.

...Andor is one of the most complex, carefully crafted television series I’ve watched in many years, and other than the settings and costumes, you might forget the larger mythological context.

Provides an intelligent backstory to the pre Star Wars Episode 1 period. Well cast, beautifully shot with cinema class settings, costumes and effects. Not just a great Star Wars series, but amazing series on any level. A note though that this can be more for the thinking viewer than those after a rollercoaster of action.

I started watching Season Two some time ago and found the first 4-5 episodes to be way too unnecessarily complicated with far too many unexplained subplots and characters that I stopped watching it out of frustration.
Dear lord but this needed some serious editing. I came back to it this past weekend while surfing for something to watch, and I have to admit that back half of the season was outstanding.
I binge watched the remaining episodes, then ended up watching “Rogue One” again with a newfound appreciation for the film.
All I can say is be patient with this one, it’s worth it in the end.

Andor is one of the best shows I have seen in many years. It is up there with the best of the best. It is good despite being star wars rather than because it is Star Wars. It does some of the best world building of any entry in Star Wars. It is incredibly timely. The dialogue is impeccable. The production is incredibly well done. I recommend this show to anyone regardless of whether you like Star Wars or sci fi. It is a powerful show with a message that resonates across time and tells a human story.
You should watch this.

The Force was with this one. It’s a shame they had to rush the ending when it was decided that season 2 would be the end.
