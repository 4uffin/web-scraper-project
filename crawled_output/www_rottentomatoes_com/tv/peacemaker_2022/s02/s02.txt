Peacemaker's second season goes multidimensional while still maintaining a singular focus on emotional stakes, seamlessly transporting this outrageous antihero into a fresh cinematic universe.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hours—even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But it’s also strangely fascinating.

David Craig
Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments – and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Decider
Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

Peacemaker s2 has been a rollercoaster... It has so many twists and turns and unexpected details that all somehow land. The actors have done a good job, and it is clear they all understand their characters, even the actresses of Sasha and Emilia. Sasha is supposed to be hella annoying and Emilia is Emilia. John however...... man..... wth. So good. I like how the story does not have a set villain or a set direction, because Chris' character development and emotion is what is shaping the story, not the other way around. Really good in depth analysis and a test of Peacemaker, after s1's character development from a jerk.... to a really good man. BUT WHY DID HE MAKE ADRIAN CRY, HE SAID EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY, BUT FORGOT ABOUT ADRIAN. SCREW U P, I LOVE V

What is season 2 actually about? A father's vendetta to avenge his son's killing. Compared to season 1, season 2 of Peacemaker doesn't have much of a plot. Season 1 was about a possible apocalypse that could have involved all of us, so we were led to believe. Gunn's writing at times is also really bad. You have an alien that is killed by Peacemaker's father and that's how he gets the dimensional portal. But why did that alien have the portal, there doesn't seem to be alien invasion in the other dimension. Also, what was the alien doing on earth and why haven't more come in over 20 years. Especially, when you consider that the alien didn't make it back to their planet.

The actors this season deserve the highest praise. Especially John and Jenn, who demonstrate a wide range of acting. Tim Meadows and Michael Rooker are hilarious!

The episode showcased everything that's best about this series: the emotional depth, the brilliantly written characters we’ve come to love, the intense action, and the exploration of themes that touch every one of us. Because who, under the weight of painful experiences, hasn’t dreamed of an alternate reality where everything is perfect, forgetting that it’s precisely those experiences that shape us, while we remain blind to the good that surrounds us?

Terrible. Every single line in the script is a joke or put there for comedy. Devalues the seriousness of anything in the show. It’s also very clear James Gunn is going down the path of fantasizing his wife with his fav wrestling star… not a single joke lands. Script makes zero sense whatsoever . Rick senior is 15 years older than Rick Junior. So yeah I’m gonna believe a 15 year old had a child and still got into the armed forces . I’m sure it’s possible but extremely radical and unlikely. Then this eagle has more plot armor than James Bond and I can’t tell if that’s also supposed to be a joke or not.
