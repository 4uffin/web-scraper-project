Critics Consensus
Peacemaker's second season goes multidimensional while still maintaining a singular focus on emotional stakes, seamlessly transporting this outrageous antihero into a fresh cinematic universe.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hours—even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But it’s also strangely fascinating.

David Craig
Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments – and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Decider
Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

Luis !
Cena lleva su actuación a otro nivel en esta temporada, sin duda nació para ser Peacemaker.
Las subtramas que se desarrollan detrás de la principal son simplemente geniales, la tensión se mantiene y pretende ser ese hilo conductor que lleve a DC a la grandeza

Season one was amazing and by far one of my most favorite DC shows.
Season two, however, has been completely boring and very disappointing so far. There seems to be no direction for the season at all, at least not an interesting one. I hope it turns around, but with this many episodes in, I’m not hopeful.
