Peacemaker's second season goes multidimensional while still maintaining a singular focus on emotional stakes, seamlessly transporting this outrageous antihero into a fresh cinematic universe.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hours—even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But it’s also strangely fascinating.

David Craig
Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments – and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

Cara, essa 2 temporada é boa mas eu só achei muito lenta até agr e não gostei da forma como o James Gunn trabalhou o Vigilante nesses 5 primeiros episódios, só agr no 6 que realmente ele vai ter seu destaque real com seu traje e tudo, mas tirando isso é uma boa temporada mas não é melhor que a primeira.

"Peacemaker" season 2 promises to be a compelling continuation of the series. The emotional depth and narrative expertise demonstrated by James Gunn suggest another masterpiece. Initial reception of season 1 was overwhelmingly positive, and the anticipation for "Creature Commandos" further heightened excitement. The prospect of a second season for this acclaimed show is highly encouraging. "Peacemaker" season 2 has the potential to significantly contribute to the DCU's ongoing success.

Peacemaker s2 has been a rollercoaster... It has so many twists and turns and unexpected details that all somehow land. The actors have done a good job, and it is clear they all understand their characters, even the actresses of Sasha and Emilia. Sasha is supposed to be hella annoying and Emilia is Emilia. John however...... man..... wth. So good. I like how the story does not have a set villain or a set direction, because Chris' character development and emotion is what is shaping the story, not the other way around. Really good in depth analysis and a test of Peacemaker, after s1's character development from a jerk.... to a really good man. BUT WHY DID HE MAKE ADRIAN CRY, HE SAID EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY, BUT FORGOT ABOUT ADRIAN. SCREW U P, I LOVE V

What is season 2 actually about? A father's vendetta to avenge his son's killing. Compared to season 1, season 2 of Peacemaker doesn't have much of a plot. Season 1 was about a possible apocalypse that could have involved all of us, so we were led to believe. Gunn's writing at times is also really bad. You have an alien that is killed by Peacemaker's father and that's how he gets the dimensional portal. But why did that alien have the portal, there doesn't seem to be alien invasion in the other dimension. Also, what was the alien doing on earth and why haven't more come in over 20 years. Especially, when you consider that the alien didn't make it back to their planet.
