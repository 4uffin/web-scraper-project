Critics Consensus
Peacemaker's second season goes multidimensional while still maintaining a singular focus on emotional stakes, seamlessly transporting this outrageous antihero into a fresh cinematic universe.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
Dimensional travel, vengeful relatives and spurts of bloody violence set the tone for a series that remains a cartoonish change of pace.
Rated: 3/5

Guardian
Gunn clearly loved these damaged characters enough to carry them over to his shiny new universe, but he is also never afraid to put them through the wringer. It makes even the tiniest victories in their lives feel momentous.
Rated: 4/5

Slate
Like the first season, the second season of Peacemaker risks stretching too few jokes over too many hoursâ€”even if sometimes the joke going on for too long is the joke. But itâ€™s also strangely fascinating.

David Craig
Radio Times
From the opening dance number, it's an enormous amount of fun that carefully balances its surreal pleasures with impactful character-led moments â€“ and plenty of unexpected twists.
Rated: 4/5

While I do not suffer from bird blindness, I can say that Peacemaker soars with the ducks.

Decider
Peacemaker continues to be a funny but emotional superhero drama, with a surprisingly effective performance by Cena at its center, with a fun-to-watch ensemble around him.

Magnus B.
Terrible. Every single line in the script is a joke or put there for comedy. Devalues the seriousness of anything in the show. Itâ€™s also very clear James Gunn is going down the path of fantasizing his wife with his fav wrestling starâ€¦ not a single joke lands. Script makes zero sense whatsoever . Rick senior is 15 years older than Rick Junior. So yeah Iâ€™m gonna believe a 15 year old had a child and still got into the armed forces . Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s possible but extremely radical and unlikely. Then this eagle has more plot armor than James Bond and I canâ€™t tell if thatâ€™s also supposed to be a joke or not.

Peacemaker se destaca como uma sÃ©rie que consegue equilibrar com maestria o humor e a profundidade. A trama Ã© construÃ­da de forma a ser extremamente divertida e, ao mesmo tempo, surpreendentemente inteligente em sua abordagem de temas complexos.
O humor Ã© um dos pontos mais fortes da sÃ©rie. Ela utiliza a comÃ©dia de uma forma que vai alÃ©m das piadas Ã³bvias, explorando o ridÃ­culo de seu personagem principal e do mundo ao seu redor. Essa abordagem faz com que a sÃ©rie seja leve e fÃ¡cil de acompanhar.
No entanto, por trÃ¡s da comÃ©dia, hÃ¡ um roteiro muito bem pensado. A sÃ©rie aborda questÃµes como trauma, amizade e o significado de ser um herÃ³i de uma maneira que respeita a inteligÃªncia do espectador. A histÃ³ria consegue ser envolvente e, por vezes, emocionalmente impactante.
Em resumo, Peacemaker Ã© uma sÃ©rie que funciona em vÃ¡rias camadas. Ã‰ uma experiÃªncia divertida e engraÃ§ada, mas que tambÃ©m oferece uma narrativa substancial e inteligente, tornando-a uma Ã³tima recomendaÃ§Ã£o para quem busca mais do que apenas entretenimento.
