Boston Globe
In a sense there are two shows here. “Seen & Heard” is most bracing when it interrogates the thornier elements of its subject, and goes down easier when it follows its imperative to accentuate the positive.

What’s here is always interesting, elegantly produced, sometimes exciting, often moving. Young viewers, whose historical and cultural interests might extend no further than their own births, may have their eyes opened...

Fox 4 Kansas City
It's all pretty surface level stuff, and in my opinion felt a bit rushed.
Rated: 3/5

Overall, “Seen & Heard” is still a timely and provocative examination of ongoing inequality.
Rated: 3/5

Seen & Heard: The History Of Black Television foregoes a straightforward look at the chronology of Black television and takes a deep dive into representation and how it’s better in 2025 but could still use a lot of improvement.
