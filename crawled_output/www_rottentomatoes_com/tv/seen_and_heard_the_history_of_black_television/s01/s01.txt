Chris Vognar
Boston Globe
In a sense there are two shows here. “Seen & Heard” is most bracing when it interrogates the thornier elements of its subject, and goes down easier when it follows its imperative to accentuate the positive.

Los Angeles Times
What’s here is always interesting, elegantly produced, sometimes exciting, often moving. Young viewers, whose historical and cultural interests might extend no further than their own births, may have their eyes opened...

KKFI-FM (Kansas City)
Overall, “Seen & Heard” is still a timely and provocative examination of ongoing inequality.
Rated: 3/5

Decider
Seen & Heard: The History Of Black Television foregoes a straightforward look at the chronology of Black television and takes a deep dive into representation and how it’s better in 2025 but could still use a lot of improvement.
