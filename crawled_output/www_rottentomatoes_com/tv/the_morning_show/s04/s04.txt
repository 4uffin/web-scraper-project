The Morning Show — Season 4
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Shaking up its ensemble yet again while staying consistent in its tonal unevenness, The Morning Show's fourth season ought to satisfy viewers who consider excess to be a virtue.

[The Morning Show] knows what it is -- and what it needs to work: conspiracy, betrayal and steamy sex scenes.

This is a better series than the previous one and slightly less preposterous, although that’s not saying much.

The resulting season feels mostly like filler that had me yearning for the episodes in which The Morning Show might finally grapple with the actual biggest threat to news media.

These actors continue to merit our attention while the material will only inspire devotion from its biggest fans.

The only joy in watching it now lies in wondering just how far they will push the boundaries of plausibility this time.

There’s no hashtag or headline-making story that The Morning Show won’t shoehorn into its narrative, and this season’s no different, although it finally understands how to do it more subtly.

The best show to hate watch. Every character on the show is so devoid of emotional depth, I feel empty after watching it. "America's Sweetheart", Jen Anniston, has become so insufferable its hard to watch her in anything these days. Also, since season 1, I've felt this was a miscasting for Reese Witherspoon. This show is simply a vehicle for these actors to stay on the awards circuit where Hollywood congratulates each other on their narrow viewpoints. And so that Jen and Reese can ego trip by playing journalist in expensive clothing.

So relevant and a refresher to watch exactly what we seek from our news broadcasting system across the US nation. I personally, love this show. Every actor has killed their role in the Morning Show!

The Morning Show is overrated and mediocre and gets worse with every season. I suppose Apple has the money to burn and star egos need to be satisfied. It didn't deserve to be renewed.

A must-see series that’s exaggerated, but not too far from the truth.
