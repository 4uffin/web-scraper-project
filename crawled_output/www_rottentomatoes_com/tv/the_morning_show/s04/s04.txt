The Morning Show — Season 4
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Shaking up its ensemble yet again while staying consistent in its tonal unevenness, The Morning Show's fourth season ought to satisfy viewers who consider excess to be a virtue.

James Dyer
Empire Magazine
Far from the series strongest outing, this is still mildly compelling viewing thanks to a stacked cast and an inherently buzzy setting.
Rated: 3/5

The Nightly (AU)
Everything is arch, everything is melodramatic. It only plays one note, which is just noise, not music.

Globe and Mail
[The Morning Show] knows what it is -- and what it needs to work: conspiracy, betrayal and steamy sex scenes.

Alison Rowat
The Herald (Scotland)
It is the in-fighting that keeps The Morning Show fresh -- not debates about the future of media. The sooner it returns to its business as usual, the better.
Rated: 3/5

El Pais (Spain)
What The Morning Show demonstrates, once again, flawlessly, accurately, and brilliantly, is that journalism may be dead, but journalists aren't. [Full review in Spanish]

CBR
Despite the small amount of a morning show on The Morning Show in Season 4, the story still revolves around “the job” for each character.

Edward L
A mildly watchable satire about TV, although being American it has no understanding of the concept of irony. Its watchability is not helped by the presence of the walking hair-cut Jennifer Aniston whose performance is even worse than it was on the awful 'Friends'.

How was the show still on the air? I couldn’t even make it through the first episode. Boring as hell.

The best show to hate watch. Every character on the show is so devoid of emotional depth, I feel empty after watching it. "America's Sweetheart", Jen Anniston, has become so insufferable its hard to watch her in anything these days. Also, since season 1, I've felt this was a miscasting for Reese Witherspoon. This show is simply a vehicle for these actors to stay on the awards circuit where Hollywood congratulates each other on their narrow viewpoints. And so that Jen and Reese can ego trip by playing journalist in expensive clothing.

So relevant and a refresher to watch exactly what we seek from our news broadcasting system across the US nation. I personally, love this show. Every actor has killed their role in the Morning Show!

The Morning Show is overrated and mediocre and gets worse with every season. I suppose Apple has the money to burn and star egos need to be satisfied. It didn't deserve to be renewed.
