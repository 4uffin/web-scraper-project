Three strangers share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one. When a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive Upper West Side apartment building, the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth. Perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another. Soon, the endangered trio comes to realize a killer might be living among them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it's too late.

Season 4 is a mystery you don't need to be solved.
Rated: 2/4

This season, there’s a major influx of talent added to Only Murders in the Building -- but the new and returning faces don’t outshine the stars. They shine, and play, right along with them.

The Nightly (AU)
With its outsized characters, random asides and non-sequiturs, Only Murders in the Building remains an absolute delight.

Hindustan Times
With such a stellar cast lining up in its service, and the goodwill of three loved seasons to back it up, the latest instalment of Only Murders in the Building commits gross disservice to everything that could've worked in its favour.

While there are still laughs – particularly Sazz Pataki’s stunt pals, Eva Longoria embracing life as a would-be super sleuth, & a getting-to-know-you montage with Galafianakis and Oliver that’s borderline romantic – season 4 has a lot more heart.
Rated: 4/5
