Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka? Pure fan-service perfection.
Rated: B+

Reminded me of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons, in that they are made to be enjoyed by children, while also including material and references designed for adults. So it's very easy for me to recommend the show to adults of all ages

Better than the first season. Only downside is that there is not enough content.

LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past is not as enjoyable as season one.
The writing has even more exposition here. The first two episodes were on the same level as the best parts of season one, but the two latter episodes were quite boring to me.
The visuals are still good, but I felt like this season was even more stop motion-like. I wonder if this was on purpose or maybe they worked with less than 24 frames per second. The score is still as good, Michael Kramer should work on bigger projects in the franchise. The cast is still great and they even added some new members who I was excited to hear again.
LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past is fun, but I think they should not continue it.
