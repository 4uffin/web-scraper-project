Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Ashley Eckstein as Ahsoka? Pure fan-service perfection.

Reminded me of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons, in that they are made to be enjoyed by children, while also including material and references designed for adults. So it's very easy for me to recommend the show to adults of all ages

The only negative thing I have to say is that we don’t have more of it!
The creators did a phenomenal job at creating a unique, original story with new characters, while also seamlessly blending in elements from all across the Star Wars franchise, including the original, sequel, and prequel trilogies, shows like Andor and the Clone Wars, and even video games like Knights of the old Republic and Jedi Survivor. We finally got LEGO Darth Revan!
This series brought fun and humor back to Star Wars, it’s silly and lighthearted, but also has some great emotional moments as well.
The voice cast is outstanding, Gaten Matarazzo, Dan Stevens, Mark Hamill came back to voice Luke Skywalker, Ben Schwartz, Billy Dee Williams, Ahmed Best, so many incredible actors and Star Wars veterans were involved.
I love the “What if…” storytelling approach this show takes because it reminds me of how i used to play with my toys and action figures when I was younger. It makes this show so much fun and enjoyable to watch because you want to see what kinds of crazy twists they throw in.
It’s a must-watch for Star Wars fans of all ages!

Better than the first season. Only downside is that there is not enough content.

LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past is not as enjoyable as season one.
The writing has even more exposition here. The first two episodes were on the same level as the best parts of season one, but the two latter episodes were quite boring to me.
The visuals are still good, but I felt like this season was even more stop motion-like. I wonder if this was on purpose or maybe they worked with less than 24 frames per second. The score is still as good, Michael Kramer should work on bigger projects in the franchise. The cast is still great and they even added some new members who I was excited to hear again.
LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy – Pieces of the Past is fun, but I think they should not continue it.
