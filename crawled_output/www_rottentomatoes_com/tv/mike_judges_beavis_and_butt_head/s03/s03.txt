Since the show is animated, the injury and destruction Beavis and Butt-Head experience plays out like Wile E. Coyote sketches.

TO COMEDY CENTRAL & MIKE JUDGE: IN THE FAMOUS WORDS OF BUTTHEAD, "TAKE A BOW." I've been waiting for months for Season 3 to kick off, and that wait was worth every second! Beavis and Butthead have done it again, somehow managing to be even funnier than last season (which I thought was the pinnacle of hilarious). Only 2min into 3:1, Braces, I was laughing so hard that it literally hurt. And it's been the same with every episode since. Mike Judge is a genius! Beavis & Butthead have been staples of my life since the 90's, and they've only gotten better as time goes by. I hope and pray these two absolute culture icons never, ever go away. Season 3 is a HOME RUN!!!!

I remember watching Beavis and Butthead on MTV back in the 1990s. The guys were funny then and they're still funny. I wish they go back to reviewing Heavy Metal videos again.
