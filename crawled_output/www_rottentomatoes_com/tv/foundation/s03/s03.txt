Foundation ‚Äî Season 3
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Foundation's narratively knotty third season doesn't quite measure up to its superb predecessor, but this sci-fi epic endures as a faithful and well-acted adaptation of Isaac Asimov's masterpiece.

Craig Mathieson
Sydney Morning Herald
[Pilou Asbaek's] demonstrations add an element of horror to Foundation, which also has a sly sense of humour sneaking through. Of the many fantastical elements manifesting here, influencer satire was the least expected.
Rated: 4/5

Ed Power
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Ludicrous, lavish and larkingly largely than life, it is one of the most bonkers TV shows ever made and all the richer for that lack of inhibition. Foundation is science fiction with rocket jets cranked to the max...

Continues to put the rest of its small-screen genre brethren to shame with its momentous, magnificent third season.

The juxtaposition of the mighty and the micro, supported by stunning production values, makes the war between Jared Harris‚Äô psycho-historian, Lee Pace‚Äôs clone Empire, and Pilou Asb√¶k‚Äôs unpredictably charming Mule irresistible

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
This season swings for the fences hard, which is excellent. I wish the flight there hadn‚Äôt been quite so bumpy.

We‚Äôre watching multiple storylines unfold ‚Äì from splintering the Cleonic dynasty to desperate maneuvering of the Foundation‚Äôs new leaders ‚Äì and it‚Äôs all good, but also glacial.

A rather chaotic and unfocused compared to the previous seasons. Great performance by Lee Pace. I have lost the plot a long time ago and I'm just watching it by habit. The Mule and the actor who plays it are too dramatic, there's no need for such distorted image of the big villain.

"Are you feeling ok? You've hardly touched your drugs". Hilarious line. This third season is sharp all around. Cooler sci fi visuals and concepts, and better plot movement and more intriguing than the first 2 seasons.

Jeff Èóú
Great fan of s1 and s2, but storytelling goes out the window in s3.
The mule is powerful and all, but this tv series makes his(her) work look easy, the tactics and manipulation the mule pulls off deserves more screen time, i would love to trade gaal's romance scene with anything the mule does.
However, big salute to the performances of all three empires and Demerzel, they show a different kind of empire to us in every season, they are the big reasons we stick to the show.
