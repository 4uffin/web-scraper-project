All in all, Dying For Sex is a really beautiful, worthwhile, and queer watch, despite not being promoted or referred to as a queer show.

The phenomenal eight-part miniseries will make you feel all the feelings.

“Dying for Sex” refuses to settle for the neutered, morose mood most expect from a cancer story. It’s quite something to behold.

Seven Days (VT)
There are zany bits involving disciplining a human pet and attending a "kink-forward play-party potluck."...But "Dying for Sex" is a lot deeper and more touching than its one-liners and cute raunchiness might suggest.

Dying for Sex is a bold, unflinching story about what it means to take control when you have nothing left to lose. It’s not just about dying – it’s about finally learning how to live.
Rated: A+

Exclaim!
Michelle Williams and co-star Jenny Slate put forward arguably the best performances of their careers in a limited series that is simultaneously heavy-hearted and an entirely pleasant viewing experience.

One of the most amazing thing I’ve seen in the last few years. Funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking, unapologetic and deeply human. Superb performances too! Oh boy, you MUST watch it!

FINALLY a realistic display of what bdsm/kink dynamics can look like. Super impressed by the writing, acting and character development. Made me laugh out loud in every episode. A must see.

"Dying for Sex" is a heartfelt and funny series with a raunchy twist. This show taps into something real, and by the end of it, I really felt the emotions. The show took a few episodes to really grab my interest, but then I was invested to see where it would go. Michelle Williams is great as the main character here, but the scene stealing performance is from Jenny Slate, who is outstanding and perfectly cast here. The friendship between the two of them is the heart of the show, and the very last scene brought genuine tears to my eyes. Sometimes the show becomes a bit uncomfortable for my taste, but those moments even cause some laughs. Overall, it is a show that forces the viewer to ask some honest questions while showcasing the importance of a true friendship.

The writing, direction and acting are top notch! Really really good. My issue with the show (and why I didn't give it five stars) is: it doesn't seem that realistic. To me. While I get that everybody's experience with cancer is different, I'm a cancer survivor and know a few people with advanced and terminal breast cancer. I can tell you first hand that the last thing in world you *normally* feel like doing after a chemo session is having a kink session. I didn't have terrible chemo (I didn't lose my hair, I only had 4 cycles). But I was highly nauseous all the time and, at times, so exhausted, I couldn't get out of bed. A dear friend who died from cancer and his cancer had spread to his bones was in such extreme pain, he had to wear fentanyl and methadone patches all over his body and still could barely get off the couch. Again, beautifully written, acted and directed but very much a Hollywood-type concept and not too realistic to me.

Really enjoyed this take on female empowerment in traumatic times. Williams and the whole cast excellent and really pushed it in terms of onscreen sex. Only quibble was finding Slate's character too much at times; needy and over bearing, it took me out of the show sometimes. That maybe is how she's supposed to be seen.
But overall, highly recommended and great fun ... when it's supposed to be.
