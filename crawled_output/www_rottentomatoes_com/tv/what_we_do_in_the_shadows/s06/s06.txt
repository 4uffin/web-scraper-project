A look at the lives of four vampires who've lived together for hundreds of years on Staten Island. The self-appointed leader of the group is Nandor the Relentless, a warrior and conqueror from the Ottoman Empire. Then there's the British vampire Laszlo -- a bit of a rogue and a dandy and a fop, he might say. He's a lover of mischief and a soirée, but not as much as he loves seeing Nandor fail in every attempt. And then there's Nadja: the seductress, the temptress, the vampiric Bonnie to Laszlo's Clyde. Also cohabiting in the vampire household is Guillermo, Nandor's familiar; Colin Robinson, an energy vampire and day-walker of sorts -- he feasts on humans, but not on their blood.

Each time the season hit on this kind of classic material, I couldn’t help but think of all the great gags we’ll miss out on. But it makes sense for What We Do in the Shadows to bow out now.

Even when “Shadows” stretches itself with format... everything finds its way back to how it always was.

IndieWire
There's nostalgia and wish fulfillment, and various opportunities to reset the entire narrative and return to the comfort of equilibrium — but this has never been a show to shy away from a challenge.
Rated: B+

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
What We Do in the Shadows Season 6 works because we love these characters and the actors playing them. It might not reach the singular heights of previous seasons, but it allows for a charming, if eroded, farewell to these lovable vampires.
Rated: 7/10

Not everything works, but the lead performances are consistently hilarious and inventive, and the freaky energy never flags.

What did I just watch? The season felt like a slow steering toward a finale, and the finale itself was not satisfying... Unless that was the entire point, to mirror (invisibly) the meaninglessness of vampire life, then the finale is actually kind of brilliant.
