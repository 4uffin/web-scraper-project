The Times (UK)
... Despite the whole thing being an "anti-spy" thriller, this isn't Le Carré — it's a whole lot funnier.
Rated: 5/5

Slow Horses” remains one of the most entertaining and well-put-together shows around. The motions through which it goes are good ones.

It’s still utterly brilliant.

It retains the dark humour that has defined the series from the start, as well as the espionage-thriller thread, nailing that ‘strange game’ between spies referenced in Mick Jagger’s memorable and catchy main theme. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

The Hindu
And yet, in all its downtrodden glory, Slow Horses remains a thing of beauty. It’s hard to look away from a series that feels so lived-in, so utterly convinced of its own grimy brilliance.

Ana Yorke
PopMatters
With another hugely satisfying yet curiously gut-wrenching batch of episodes, this anti-spy satire bares teeth and transforms into a uniquely thoughtful and well-rounded beast in a sea of boilerplate drama thrillers.

I love the grimy feel to this show. How it plays out in a contrast to upscale backdrop to MI6 offices. So much fun to watch and see what I imagine the espionage world to be like.
It’s almost like if Mr. Bean showed up to partner with James Bond but with high level story lines and a fun lineup of characters. This show caught me by surprise and it’s fun and intriguing dialogue keeps me locked in.

It still rushes the ending and kinda sucks at wrapups but works as a spy action mix and everyone acts

I would highly recommend this series to anyone going through a difficult time or depression, or who, like me, just like a good laugh. But its much more than that, its just brilliant! Some of the lines are so hilarious I play them over a few times. Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas matching wits is just magic, talk about chemistry!
Looking forward to Season 5
