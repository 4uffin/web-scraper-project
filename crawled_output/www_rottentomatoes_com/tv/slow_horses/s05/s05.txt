Karl Quinn
The Age (Australia)
It’s this mix of high-octane action, humour – sometimes juvenile, sometimes sophisticated, always dark – and human frailty that makes Slow Horses such a compelling watch.
Rated: 4/5

Empire Magazine
The Slough House screw-ups continue to entertain, even though this particular story’s mix of intensity and comedy doesn’t always gel.
Rated: 3/5

Tim Lowery
AV Club
This many seasons in, the show needs to do some of this maneuvering so as not to drive home the same central characters’ issues and burn out... But that doesn’t make any of this less delightful to watch, maybe just less fulfilling.
Rated: B

George M. Thomas
Akron Beacon Journal
Oldman inhabits his role like the tattered, dirty raincoat Lamb wears throughout. Lowden’s River remains optimistic, even in the face of personal struggles. And Scott Thomas is borderline charming as the manipulative and occasionally malevolent Tavener.
Rated: A-

Gissane Sophia
Lady Geeks Media
There’s much to explore and unveil with the six episodes, proving that where there’s a concise vision and narrative outlining, the story will continuously find a way to be captivating. And Slow Horses Season 5 certainly captivates.

Lamb continues to be a true delight on screen, with Gary Oldman once again delivering some dialogue for the ages and new mannerisms to go down in the show’s legend
