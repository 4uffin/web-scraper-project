Ben Dowell
The Times (UK)
It is glorious fun, a taut, twisty and enjoyable thriller laced with so many funny moments.
Rated: 4/5

London Evening Standard
It is undeniably watchable. But this season points a lot of fingers without actually making any clear decisions.
Rated: 3/5

Ben Travers
IndieWire
Invigorating in its temerity, Smith’s six-episode Season 5 is told with propulsive clarity (save for the mysteries you’re intended to guess at). Chaos is sorted into appreciable story arcs without diluting its overwhelming effect on our heroes.
Rated: A-

Adam Sweeting
The Arts Desk
The adventures of Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman) and his peculiar little band of secret service misfits have come to exert a fierce stranglehold on the viewing public. Horses must be perilously close to being officially declared a cult.
Rated: 4/5

Peter Martin
ScreenAnarchy
As in past seasons, the show is less concerned about the what and is more focused on the who and why, which makes for great mystery television that grows increasingly compelling as the episodes progress.

George M. Thomas
Akron Beacon Journal
Oldman inhabits his role like the tattered, dirty raincoat Lamb wears throughout. Lowden’s River remains optimistic, even in the face of personal struggles. And Scott Thomas is borderline charming as the manipulative and occasionally malevolent Tavener.

Sir Gary Oldman and the rest of the actors are once again incredible.
This season is even funnier than previous ones, the writing maintains its extremely high quality.
Another under appreciated series on Apple TV+.
