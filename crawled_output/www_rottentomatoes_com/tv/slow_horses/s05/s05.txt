Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
...[This season] doesn’t miss a beat, combining twisty momentum and sardonic humour as a terror crisis builds during a London mayoral election. That’s a terrific achievement, but also a finale of sorts.
Rated: 4.5/5

The Times (UK)
It is glorious fun, a taut, twisty and enjoyable thriller laced with so many funny moments.
Rated: 4/5

London Evening Standard
It is undeniably watchable. But this season points a lot of fingers without actually making any clear decisions.
Rated: 3/5

To date, it’s been consistently excellent despite its rapid roll out – surely it can’t possibly keep that up? One day, it’s bound to start going downhill. But today is not that day.
Rated: 4/5

Ed Power
Irish Times
Slow Horses excels at capturing the grey vastness of modern London, and the plot is packed to bursting, but it can’t decide whether it wants to be hilarious or profound, and the humour comes across as trying too hard.

Jeff York
The Establishing Shot
The series’ dark comic sensibilities have leaned ever more towards the absurd. In doing so, the nuts in Slough House couldn’t be more in tune with their times.
Rated: 4/4

I really like this show - Gary Oldman is brilliant, always have appreciated his work.
Unfortunately, S5E1 had to pose a political falsehood that a brainwashed individual turned assassin is a right wing supporter.
Episode ended with intrigue building around the theory that the house is being hunted.

Sir Gary Oldman and the rest of the actors are once again incredible.
This season is even funnier than previous ones, the writing maintains its extremely high quality.
Another under appreciated series on Apple TV+.
