Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

The choice Task makes to soften Ruffalo’s natural affability and presence in favor of Pelphrey’s Robbie is a fascinating one, requiring humility from one actor and intense commitment from the other.

San Jose Mercury News
Task finds humanity in the bleakest of spaces here and while it doesn’t absolve its characters of their sins, it does offer them a bridge to understand each other and a chance – no matter how brief – for redemption.
Rated: 3.5/4

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

Akron Beacon Journal
You watch it for {Mark] Ruffalo, who has always shown he’s an extremely talented actor and gives Brandis an element of humanity not often given to such individuals and [Tom} Pelphrey’s Robbie is far from shallow.
Rated: B+

Task is easily the best thing on TV at the moment. A gripping crime drama with deeply sympathetic and complex characters on a collision course with no good outcomes likely. It’ll keep you on the edge of your seat.

Exclaim!
Ruffalo leads the series with a deft hand, while Tom Pelphrey shines as the antihero we slowly get drawn in towards.

There are so many plot flaws here that it's hard to keep track of them all. But I'll start with the premise that The whole premise ridiculous. The show swings to a certain side that society seems to dictate how the characters show up. This I getting so old. You can stop torturing us now.

This is a slow start but the rewards are high. Hang on till episode 3, that’s when TASK shows its true colors and how excellent the cast and writing are.

Sorry I just can't get behind this series. Mark Ruffalo is tragic and just such a terrible actor! He is no Kate Winslet that is for sure! To compare this show to Mare of Easttown is a joke! And the rest of the cast just come across as just grubby and not relatable! Hard pass on this one!

No amount of good acting can save this hackishly written and directed show.
