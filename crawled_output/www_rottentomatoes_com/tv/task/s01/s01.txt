Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

Empire Magazine
You’ve seen this kind of show before, probably many times – but Task’s compelling characters, patient writing and undercurrent of emotion help it stand out from the crowd.
Rated: 4/5

Sophie Gilbert
The Atlantic
The choice Task makes to soften Ruffalo’s natural affability and presence in favor of Pelphrey’s Robbie is a fascinating one, requiring humility from one actor and intense commitment from the other.

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Task finds humanity in the bleakest of spaces here and while it doesn’t absolve its characters of their sins, it does offer them a bridge to understand each other and a chance – no matter how brief – for redemption.
Rated: 3.5/4

La Nación (Argentina)
...Ingelsby once again crafts a story with harsh climates, in which there is no reprieve, with stories that at times seem suffocating. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 3/5

That’s the brilliance of Task. It doesn’t just blur the line between right and wrong, it erases it altogether. Every choice feels both indefensible and inevitable, forcing us to sit in the same uneasy tension as its characters.

Bangkok Post
Thanks to its strong character work, layered arcs, and slow-building suspense, Task makes its weekly release schedule worth enduring.

How do the writers of Mare of Easttown fumble so badly? The plot is nonsensical, the episodes so far are way too focused on Mark Ruffalos kids in the show, which I really am starting to not care about. His on screen family is also way too old. The dialogue just goes on and on, very meddling. I dont have any emotion with these characters, they're all terrible.

Very slow and long winded, why do we have to have half of each episode on the main character's troubled life. It just makes it quite boring and could have cut down on the episodes and had a more exciting and action packed series. Please do this next time.
