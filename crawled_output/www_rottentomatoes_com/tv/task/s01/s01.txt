Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

The Atlantic
The choice Task makes to soften Ruffalo’s natural affability and presence in favor of Pelphrey’s Robbie is a fascinating one, requiring humility from one actor and intense commitment from the other.

San Jose Mercury News
Task finds humanity in the bleakest of spaces here and while it doesn’t absolve its characters of their sins, it does offer them a bridge to understand each other and a chance – no matter how brief – for redemption.
Rated: 3.5/4

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

Akron Beacon Journal
You watch it for {Mark] Ruffalo, who has always shown he’s an extremely talented actor and gives Brandis an element of humanity not often given to such individuals and [Tom} Pelphrey’s Robbie is far from shallow.
Rated: B+

Task is easily the best thing on TV at the moment. A gripping crime drama with deeply sympathetic and complex characters on a collision course with no good outcomes likely. It’ll keep you on the edge of your seat.

Exclaim!
Ruffalo leads the series with a deft hand, while Tom Pelphrey shines as the antihero we slowly get drawn in towards.

There are no actors that are interesting enough to keep my attention. Mark Ruffalo is unconvincing as an FBI agent. I see no reason to continue watching.

Ruffalo’s character is understandably drab, but it’s far-fetched that he’d take the “kid” from a failed heist and bring him home. So unreal!

Nothing but annoying female actors crying and whining in every scene.
How do people enjoy that stuff?
They complain non stop and don’t even have hard lives.
They seem to always right some female in that role but it’s really bad in this show.
