Critics Consensus
Mark Ruffalo and Tom Pelphrey are superb in Task, a culturally-specific crime story that's unrelentingly bleak but equally riveting.

The choice Task makes to soften Ruffalo’s natural affability and presence in favor of Pelphrey’s Robbie is a fascinating one, requiring humility from one actor and intense commitment from the other.

San Jose Mercury News
Task finds humanity in the bleakest of spaces here and while it doesn’t absolve its characters of their sins, it does offer them a bridge to understand each other and a chance – no matter how brief – for redemption.
Rated: 3.5/4

Give each episode room to breathe—maybe go for a walk, feel the sun on your face—and the show can be rewarding in its own determined way.

Akron Beacon Journal
You watch it for {Mark] Ruffalo, who has always shown he’s an extremely talented actor and gives Brandis an element of humanity not often given to such individuals and [Tom} Pelphrey’s Robbie is far from shallow.
Rated: B+

Task is easily the best thing on TV at the moment. A gripping crime drama with deeply sympathetic and complex characters on a collision course with no good outcomes likely. It’ll keep you on the edge of your seat.

Exclaim!
Ruffalo leads the series with a deft hand, while Tom Pelphrey shines as the antihero we slowly get drawn in towards.

Outstanding so far. Genuinely gripping performances, well drawn characters and an interesting premise. I'm really appreciating that the show is taking the time to show the human side of its characters and developing them as living, breathing and deeply emotional people, even when they do terrible things. Editing and production is tight, and the music is surprisingly moving.

Characters are mostly boring architypes navigating familiar overwrought domestic turmoil. Alcoholic detective. Emotionally distant children. Quirky pseudo-incompetent junior FBI agents. Show really seems like a patchwork of elements lifted from other series and just hastily thrown together. Most scenes that are supposed to have emotional resonance just seem weird and out of place. The show is only interesting in the kidnapped boy / cycle gang plotline. Also, Mark Ruffalo's character's daughter looks like she's 37 years old and is supposed to be in High School which is sort of hilarious.

Not worth watching.
It's tedious and slow and unbelievable.

I find it interesting that people consider this series
“slow”. I’m assuming these people like Marvel movies or Jackie Chan. This is a compelling drama. It sticks with you and I can’t wait for the next installment. If you’re on the fence, and you like moody, thoughtful and provoking programming, give it a try. I consider myself a rough critic and found this engrossing.

There are no actors that are interesting enough to keep my attention. Mark Ruffalo is unconvincing as an FBI agent. I see no reason to continue watching.
