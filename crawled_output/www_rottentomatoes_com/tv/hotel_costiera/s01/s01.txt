Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
The entire cast is irresistible, though. "Hotel Costeira" balances the beauty of the Amalfi Coast with often humorous but compelling plots and subplots — a dreamy mix indeed.
Rated: 3/4

A solid show that doesn’t stray too far from the status quo, “Hotel Costiera” has enough juice to pull audiences in but not quite enough sparkle to make it memorable.

The Hollywood Reporter
Hotel Costiera is so lightweight as to threaten to float off entirely into the ether. But at a moment when many people are in a perpetual state of gloominess, the pleasantly sunny escapism is difficult to resent.

Samuel R. Murrian
Collider
The premise, which feels something like The White Lotus meets Taken, feels like it had genuine potential to be breezy and diverting entertainment, but Hotel Costiera falls disappointingly flat in nearly every possible way.
Rated: 3/10

Started watching as nothing else was on. First impressions were this looks like a rehash of Magnum, similar characters but a different location. Beautiful locations, easy watching and very entertaining.

Weak attempt to copy The White Lotus.
Great locations, but everything else is flat.

The storyline is pretty good.
I would enjoy the show a lot more if I could understand what is being said.
There is a lot of Italian and English spoken by Italians is very heavily accented and hard to understand.
