With seven hard-fought years of sobriety behind him, Charlie Sheen -- as you’ve never seen him -- finally leaves it all on the table, and revisits the very public peaks and valleys of his life with humor, heart, and jaw-dropping candor.

That this frustrating documentary comes with an upbeat ending is another unearned privilege.

You don’t notice until afterwards how gentle a ride Renzi has given him.

"AKA Charlie Sheen" comes across as self-serving, but fans of the actor will find it entertaining enough.

“aka Charlie Sheen” gives a sober perspective on stardom, entitlement, and yes, Tiger’s Blood.

This showbiz docuseries was great. The entire crew did an excellent job on telling the story of the rise and fall of celebrity Charlie Sheen. It was very dramatic, depressing, and insane. Charlie Sheen was just a broken man who needed serious help and support. If you haven't seen this docuseries yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.

Not sure why you are calling this 'season 1'?
My understanding is that it was just a 2 part documentary. Regardless, as much as I have never particularly had time for Charlie Sheen, he has earned my respect for his candidness and of course for being sober for near on 10 years. Just a shame that such an articulate, intelligent individual spent most of his life in a very dark place. I genuinely wish him a positive and healthy future.

I grew up watching two and a half men. What a wonderful story of Charlie Sheen. After two parts, you will feel you know Charlie Sheens story from his early acting days to his catastrophes. An absolute rise and fall of a superstar who eventually and thankfully found true sobriety.

I'm the kind of person who isn't supposed to have a natural gut reaction to this sort of lifestyle, I am expected to say how horrible addiction is and how you need to look out for your kids and that sort of thing. And I do believe all of that, but if it wasn't for the type of work my family is in I would just say the truth. Charlie Sheen is a fantastically authentic human being as he moves through different states of emotion, confidence and psychological states. It is both sad and celebratory. Hats off to him and I hope he gets back to work soon.

It was an interesting watch learning about the rise of Sheen and then seeing just how bad it got during the crash.
Its really sad seeing just how bad he looked and got.
The guy really has some special DNA to live what he lived through.
Hes a smart guy.... so it woulda been cool if he genuinely showed that he regretted some of the crazy stuff he did and talked about how it didn't do his family any favors....
But he doesn't seem to be that of deep of a thinker. Empathy doesn't seem to be something he feels.
Its more like "boy some of that stuff is uncomfortably embarrassing but the universe is a crazy place, and everything happens for a reason.
I wouldn't go back and change a thing cause then the charlie sheen story wouldn't
have been the charlie sheen story"
Happy to see he's turned his life around and was able to not go out like Hendrix or Monroe.
Signing up for two and a half men was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
It glorified his old lifestyle, ruined his sobriety, nearly killed him and was hell for his family and coworkers.
