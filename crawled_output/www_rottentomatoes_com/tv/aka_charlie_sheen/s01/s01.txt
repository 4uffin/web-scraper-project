With seven hard-fought years of sobriety behind him, Charlie Sheen -- as you’ve never seen him -- finally leaves it all on the table, and revisits the very public peaks and valleys of his life with humor, heart, and jaw-dropping candor.

That this frustrating documentary comes with an upbeat ending is another unearned privilege.

You don’t notice until afterwards how gentle a ride Renzi has given him.

Sunday Independent (Ireland)
And Sheen, “somehow makes a disreputable character loveable”. More than anything though, he makes the debauchery entertaining. And that, rather than any remorse, is the overriding impression of this film.

...the documentary invites us to question not only the nature of success and failure, but also the way we celebrate the pain of others. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

"AKA Charlie Sheen" comes across as self-serving, but fans of the actor will find it entertaining enough.

Absolutely brilliant. As someone who grew up with Platoon and Wall Street as my favourite movies it was fascinating learning about Charlie. What shone through the interviews is how incredibly lovable and likeable Charlie is, and how creative and honest he is. I love his turn of phrase and facial expressions also.

This showbiz docuseries was great. The entire crew did an excellent job on telling the story of the rise and fall of celebrity Charlie Sheen. It was very dramatic, depressing, and insane. Charlie Sheen was just a broken man who needed serious help and support. If you haven't seen this docuseries yet, check it out sometime. It's worth watching.

Not sure why you are calling this 'season 1'?
My understanding is that it was just a 2 part documentary. Regardless, as much as I have never particularly had time for Charlie Sheen, he has earned my respect for his candidness and of course for being sober for near on 10 years. Just a shame that such an articulate, intelligent individual spent most of his life in a very dark place. I genuinely wish him a positive and healthy future.
