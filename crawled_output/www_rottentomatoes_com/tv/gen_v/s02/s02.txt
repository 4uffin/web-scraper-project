Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

“Gen V” may not reach its highest potential, but it’s impressive, entertaining, and ambitious in its own right. The team should be proud, and the fans should be happy.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.
Rated: 4/5

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

Entertainment Voice
The writing actually gives meaningful conversations and character development proper space. Being young was never easy and in these tumultuous days it’s even more of an intense ride. “Gen V” absolutely understands that with heart and plenty of thrills.

Firstpost
The visual effects are gorgeous and gruesome and the conflicts these college kids are thrown into are ghastly but gobsmacking to watch. It’s like a heady cocktail of all possible emotions.
Rated: 3/5

Season 2 might start off a little slow, but once it finds its groove, Gen V is wickedly entertaining, while balancing grief arcs, political paranoia, and hilariously disgusting supe gags.
Rated: 3/5

Lot of politics in this, and its obviously trying to make villains of one side. Had so much potential.
