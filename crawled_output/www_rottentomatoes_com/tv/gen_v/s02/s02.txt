Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

“Gen V” may not reach its highest potential, but it’s impressive, entertaining, and ambitious in its own right. The team should be proud, and the fans should be happy.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

The writing actually gives meaningful conversations and character development proper space. Being young was never easy and in these tumultuous days it’s even more of an intense ride. “Gen V” absolutely understands that with heart and plenty of thrills.

The visual effects are gorgeous and gruesome and the conflicts these college kids are thrown into are ghastly but gobsmacking to watch. It’s like a heady cocktail of all possible emotions.
Rated: 3/5

Season 2 might start off a little slow, but once it finds its groove, Gen V is wickedly entertaining, while balancing grief arcs, political paranoia, and hilariously disgusting supe gags.

I don't know why people are hating. It's still good. And my only criticism is that it's just too similar to the first sesaon.

The writers of this show and the boys have gotten incredibly lazy. The gore and grotesque sex is no longer entertaining, it’s starting to reek of fetishization. Also, the writers think they are incredibly smart with their political messages and writing in this show but it too stinks of going for low hanging fruit and just trying to compare the show with issues in modern day America, and not offering a nuanced view of it even. It’s very black and white and not good

This is horrible and lazy writing. Writers were to busy writing about gore and sx that they forgot to write a decent story. And enough with the political crap of both sides. What the heck happened to this franchise? Its no wonder The Boys got canceled. This will easily be the season that cancels Gen V.

I'm not saying don't watch the show. they can be political as much as they want be as long as it's good. This has to be some of the worst writing I've ever seen it's like they don't care what they put out. They just basically want to gross you out, and show as much nude men as possible.

The degradation of The Boys makes its way here. Extreme obvious political pandering and stances where the messages are so blatant, the story and writing are FORCED to take a backseat. Doesn't matter whether you you think Orange Man is Bad, the point is that a good story leaves you thinking, it doesn't tell you what to think.
