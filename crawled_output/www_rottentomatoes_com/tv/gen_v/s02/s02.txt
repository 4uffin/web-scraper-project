Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

“Gen V” may not reach its highest potential, but it’s impressive, entertaining, and ambitious in its own right. The team should be proud, and the fans should be happy.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

The visual effects are gorgeous and gruesome and the conflicts these college kids are thrown into are ghastly but gobsmacking to watch. It’s like a heady cocktail of all possible emotions.
Rated: 3/5

Season 2 might start off a little slow, but once it finds its groove, Gen V is wickedly entertaining, while balancing grief arcs, political paranoia, and hilariously disgusting supe gags.
Rated: 3/5

As it continues to skewer the politics and society of real-life America, Gen V also keeps up its crackling writing.

Absolutely love this season! So impressed with how the producers
honored Chance. The break out star -AGAIN-is definitely Lizze Broadway. She has it all-the comedy, the drama, the heart …and authenticity. She is so very FUNNY. Lands the comedy and is VERY REAL!
Pew. Pew. lol.

Spoiler warning:
It feels like the series has stumbled a bit.
The last season ended on a cliff hanger with all the main characters trapped in a lab.
It starts this season with them being released, which feels bizarre.
It feels like the writers couldn't work the script with them in the lab so they just magicked them back into the school.
Then they talk about Andre dying, a lot.
It's the core topic in the majority of conversations. Admittedly it's sad that a cast member died but it didn't need this much focus.
Then the story is, hey, there was a research project we should look into. That also feels like it just appears out of nowhere. One of the characters who magically escaped coincidentally bumps into one of the main characters from the boyz who tells her to get details about a specific research project because it's important.
So now we're back in the school. There's a new mystery and they're trying to solve it. Which was essentially the plot of season one... We did this already.
The market is competitive right now, more competitive than it was when season one came out. Right now on Disney is Alien Earth which is insanely good. It makes this look bad by comparison.
So while Gen V is ok TV, it's not great TV and it's nearing the end of its shelf life, which is sad because really, these characters just need to graduate.

Unnecessary hate Reviews here smh...
Season is great. They handled the death of Chance very good although i would have preferred a recasting
Story is solid and keeps me interested but i dont like all this Social Media/Tik Tok Stuff in it.. too much for me
Characters are great and the fights look fantastic.
CGI looks decent.

Boring predictable tripe.
All you need to know is the whiter, blonder and more male a character is, the more evil they are. Thats it. Nothing more.

Gen V is back with a touching tribute to Chance. Season 2 gets off to a rocky start but remains as strong as ever.
