Critics Consensus
Tastefully navigating the tragic loss of Chance Pedromo while getting a big boost from Hamish Linklater's villainous turn, Gen V's sophomore season gets high marks as a spinoff that feels essential.

“Gen V” may not reach its highest potential, but it’s impressive, entertaining, and ambitious in its own right. The team should be proud, and the fans should be happy.

Gen V is aware of its own limited relevance in the grand scheme of things but has embraced its small role with pluck and charm.

The series delves deeper into how we push children in our technologically driven society to see themselves as products that can be sold to a broader audience, rather than as individuals who can exist beyond the bounds of consumption.

The visual effects are gorgeous and gruesome and the conflicts these college kids are thrown into are ghastly but gobsmacking to watch. It’s like a heady cocktail of all possible emotions.

Season 2 might start off a little slow, but once it finds its groove, Gen V is wickedly entertaining, while balancing grief arcs, political paranoia, and hilariously disgusting supe gags.
Rated: 3/5

As it continues to skewer the politics and society of real-life America, Gen V also keeps up its crackling writing.

The degradation of The Boys makes its way here. Extreme obvious political pandering and stances where the messages are so blatant, the story and writing are FORCED to take a backseat. Doesn't matter whether you you think Orange Man is Bad, the point is that a good story leaves you thinking, it doesn't tell you what to think.

I love The Boys, but Gen V hits different. Gruesome, shocking, and insane—yet still raw, vulnerable, and full of heart. Emma (Lizze Broadway) is a total force—flying through the air in beer pong, then tiny Emma running through the party with a phone (cracked me up). And those scenes with Polarity? So touching, so needed after Andre’s death. It gave the audience a breath of heart in all the madness.

Whoa! I didn't believe they could top the first season, but the first three episodes are dynamite. I'm hoping the writers can sustain the momentum. Please try not to let the negative reviews sway you. If you enjoyed season one, then there'll be no surprises. Gen V is a satire of contemporary life.

Gen V doesn’t hold back—it’s messy, bloody, and unapologetically twisted, just like The Boys. But underneath the chaos, the character work is killer. Emma, Jordan, and Kate hook you from the jump, and you can already feel the arcs cutting deeper than your standard “intro” episodes.
Emma (Lizze Broadway) is the absolute MVP—confident, hilarious, and full of raw heart. Her scenes with Polarity hit harder than expected, and she brings a spark that keeps the show from drowning in its own carnage. The cast chemistry is electric, the humor hits dark and sharp, and the visuals blow the roof off. If this is just the warm-up, Gen V is ready to go full detonation.

A fantastic continuation of The Boys universe. I am very excited to learn more about Marie and how the Guardians of Godolkin develop.

Enjoyed Season 1 but Season 2 is borderline unwatchable. My wife and I struggled to make it through the first episode. Absolutely cringey writing and acting. Every scene is an exposition dump. It’s like the writers forgot they were supposed to show us instead of tell us. Everything that was wrong with S4 of the Boys is somehow even worse here. The “humor” is just crude and unfunny, or more “Orange man bad” forced political messaging. I’m not a political person, I watch shows like this to take a break from reality not to listen to immerse myself in more current day politics. People need to stop pretending to be activists, and just write the F-ing show.
