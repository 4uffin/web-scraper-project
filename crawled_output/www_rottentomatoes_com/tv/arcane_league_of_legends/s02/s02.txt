What to Know
Critics Consensus
Expansive in scope while hurtling towards the endgame at a rollicking pace, Arcane's second and final season is a supremely satisfying capper to an epic saga.

In true Arcane form, the visuals literally paint a sad but gorgeous image of Jinx feeling unmoored without someone to follow.

They really hit the ground running, and at the end of the first episode, I knew this season wasn’t going to let up.

"Arcane" continues to be the most visually stunning and dense series on television today, demonstrating why animation remains the most daring medium for creatives to convey a potent narrative. One can only hope for more stories from this vast universe.

Storytelling cannot be perfectly even all the time, but in [the] quest to make sure that Arcane concluded in a true ending, many of the characters we loved fell to the wayside, and the thematic importance they carried fell with them.
Rated: 8.5/10

Disappointing compared to season 1 but still worth watching

Once again, Arcane proves its worth as a spectacle and one of the more impactful animated show of our time, even if it can't quite capture the magic of season one.
Rated: 9/10

Felt like someone decided to speed-run 2 seasons worth of plot in 9 episodes. Friends become enemies and enemies become friends with minimal explanation and screen time. Lots of side characters are thrown in with supposedly meaningful moments, but I wouldn't even remember who they were or why I should care about them (ex: that big guy with a beard who teamed up with Vi on the enforcers, that redhead kid who got mindwiped by Viktor, etc.). There was an overuse of montages and time skips. There was no real world building...what's going in Piltover with the increasing chaos? what do the locals think of everything going on?Interesting plot lines just didn't get a lot of screen time. Then the story just....ends, with little indication of what the heck is the current state of things. As a result, it came across as a bit of a jumbled mess. Not as grounded as season 1.

It's a massive disappointment at least for me. I hate Season 2 with all my heart. Season should've never happened. I don't care about the characters anymore. The new characters they added don't even matter to me.

steven s
could have been better, i felt lost on many plot points, just never explained at least not in a way i could follow, super lean too, no filler at all as far as i saw, so i need to 100% pay attention at all times, 0 pause with just fun filler to process things in between, and it lacks the glue that holds it all together. the ending? just ruins, tons of unanswered questions, and a bitter taste of dissatisfaction left afterwards. it started strong but then just went hard into everyone loses, no winners, burn it all down and have just scraps left in the ashes, which i dont fully hate, not enough stories leave it with no winners, only losers, but doesnt mean i enjoy it. it also leaves you to guess if something happened or not, doesnt outright tell you nor show you, so your just left glueless trying to use what little is left of your focus to pick out super subtle details to figure out fates of characters since the show wount just clarify them to you... which when you have no pause in full focus demand, is really hard to do.
visuals are amazing as 1st season, all the amazing Arcane things, writing is good, even if the end sucked for my liking, but the way it was directed and put together just sucked major ass... they tried to fit too much into too little, instead of just adding 1 more episode, or even 5 minutes to each episode to make it all work.

My son suggested this animated series to me because I love the animation style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie featuring the character Miles Morales and the animation style of TMNT Mutant Mayhem. The animation of Arcane truly blew me away. I can’t believe it took me so long to notice this series on Netflix. After Season 1 amazed me, I started Season 2 immediately! Season 2 is darker and even more developed. Of both seasons, it contains my favorite episodes.

It’s been praised a lot just because of the animation quality, while the story itself is really illogical and sometimes even naive
