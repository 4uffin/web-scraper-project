In a wealthy suburb where everything appears to be perfect on the surface, four members of the local garden club get entangled in a scandalous murder. Teacher and aspiring writer Alice, real estate agent Catherine, father of two Brett and socialite Birdie come together on the night of the garden club's annual gala to bury the body in their own garden -- and get rid of the evidence. But with mysteries, drama and deceit growing like weeds in each of their personal lives, this secret may not stay undiscovered for long.

Critics Consensus
Naughty and not so nice with its salacious tour through the suburbs, Grosse Pointe Garden Society's twists aren't the sharpest shears in the shed but a game cast keeps the series watchable.

Ben Pobjie
The Age (Australia)
The series struggles with earnestness at times and is at its weakest when it tries to twang the heartstrings a little too hard. It’s at its best when the characters are sniping waspishly at each other...
Rated: 3.5/5

AV Club
Melissa Fumero and Aja Naomi King chew the scenery in NBC’s new drama. Grosse Pointe Garden Society is a breezy watch that joins a crop of new network TV shows that rely on nostalgia with a bit of a twist.
Rated: B+

Angie Han
The Hollywood Reporter
It’s HBO’s Big Little Lies without the sharp satirical bite or the devastating emotionality, or ABC’s Desperate Housewives minus the cheeky self-aware humor, or NBC’s Good Girls sans the lively and immediate chemistry.

Totally lacking in deeper meaning and subtlety, this is definitely a relax and enjoy type of series. And enjoy it, I think you will.

What She Said
Aims for sophistication but in the end its soap, baby, soap.
Loads of plots and subplots whizzing around changing things, combined with the catty folks and their consciences and actions is FUN.
Rated: 3/4

A group of friends gets caught up in a scandalous murder. Nearly every character in this show had morality issues and there was a lot of infidelity and sexual stuff that made it hard to really care about anyone of the characters. Brett was the only likeable character.
I liked the nonlinear storytelling, it was fresh and different, and I liked how they incorporated phrases like “present day” or “six month earlier” into things like a tattoo, a milk carton, or things like that.
I will say the show keeps you hooked and wanting to watch more because you just want to know who the dead person is. The show does an excellent job at making you think it’s one person, then changing it the next episode.
The season did start to feel a big dragged out at times and I’m glad I finally finished it, I don’t think it’s a show I personally would recommend.

I am absolutely baffled by the positive ratings. I was frustrated, but intrigued through the first 11 episodes. But, without spoiling anything, everything from there forward was atrocious and embarrassing. Only Game of Thrones has fumbled the bag on the same level with an ending.

I just can't understand people who gave it more than a star. I specifically registered here to rate it as bad as possible. I feel that script writers just spit in my face and not only with the ending.
Yes, actors, views are good, acting is decent, but what the... is this plot? I STRONGLY recommend no one waste their time (TWELVE HOURS!!!) on this show, because characters has zero motivation, twists are on the lowest level and overall this is super terrible. Always some Gods from Machines, super weird coincidences any time script writers need one and A GODDAMN NEXT SEASON alert, so you will actually know nothing.
I can admit that up to 11 ep I had a TINY believe that the main thing behind all those dances would be at least interesting, but it turns out to be SO STUPID, that it is just a total disrespect to people who will watch it.
And the fun part is that plot twist happens twice, in last episode also, but for some reason characters become a bit smarter than the previous time.
