What to Know
Critics Consensus
Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.

TIME Magazine
It’s all pretty delightful for those of us who are old enough to appreciate not just the referential casting, but also the just-campy-enough performances that Buscemi, Matarazzo, and the rest deliver.

Slate
The lack of a romantic plot for our lugubrious heroine is the biggest change so far between Wednesday Seasons 1 and 2. Hell, it might even be the only major narrative change, and it’s surprisingly refreshing.

If television is losing eyeballs in the digital era, then Wednesday appears to have cracked the code to retaining them.
Rated: 4/5

Sarah's Backstage Pass
Beyond the plot twists, the performances elevate the season. Every actor breathes new life into their character, the show widens the spotlight to showcase more than just Wednesday’s perspective. This shift gives the world of Nevermore greater dimension.
Rated: 4/4

Despite the myriad subplots and annoying digressions, the series’ momentum is brisk and keeps your attention.

Driven by a star making turn by Evie Templeton in a breakthrough performance, the second season of Wednesday has enough surprises in store to get you pulled in the right direction.

Excellent series and stays true to the original 'Adams Family' TV series from the 1960's.
Comedy, suspense, horror, and teen/family drama all wrapped up into one very original series.
The acting and script/plots are well done.
In fact, within each series there are multiple plots - not just one plot that encompasses the whole season. In season 2, there are five distinct story-lines that come to a conclusion and a new story lines added and left open in the last episode to set up season 3.
My overall take is that this is a 'fun' show to watch for the whole family.

The S
This genuinely feels like it was written episode by episode without any rhyme or reason to an actual story. There’s no real plot here, unfortunately. I know it’s basically a kid’s show but all the CGI effects in the world couldn’t help this season.
It’s interesting because we’ve seen some series really develop to the point where they’ve become basically movies that are broken up into smaller chunks..the series as an art has really developed and evolved.
Not here. This one is awful this time around. Last season was watchable because there was an actual thread running through with some type of storyline. They lost that in this season and each episode just jumps around without any development and without any regard to an actual story.
And Netflix breaking it up with a month long hiatus between the story only made that worse. If you thought keeping track of a bunch of random episodes without a plot is tough, wait until you try it with a monthlong break between them.

Season 2 is halfway over and I'm bored and confused.
Too many plot lines and subplots and the story just seems like they had too many writers, too many ideas, and thought they should throw in everything from zombies to the kitchen sink (I'm waiting for the latter to happen before the finale).
The story lacks cohesiveness and just seems like a jumble of ideas that aren't going anywhere.
