Critics Consensus
Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.

TIME Magazine
It’s all pretty delightful for those of us who are old enough to appreciate not just the referential casting, but also the just-campy-enough performances that Buscemi, Matarazzo, and the rest deliver.

Slate
The lack of a romantic plot for our lugubrious heroine is the biggest change so far between Wednesday Seasons 1 and 2. Hell, it might even be the only major narrative change, and it’s surprisingly refreshing.

If television is losing eyeballs in the digital era, then Wednesday appears to have cracked the code to retaining them.
Rated: 4/5

Despite the myriad subplots and annoying digressions, the series’ momentum is brisk and keeps your attention.

Driven by a star making turn by Evie Templeton in a breakthrough performance, the second season of Wednesday has enough surprises in store to get you pulled in the right direction.

Jenna Ortega was born to play this role. Funny, campy and at times scary. But a lot of fun. Confusing at times. Didn't like her Emmy "dress". Or was it her necklace?

In S2 Wednesday outwits the "Normies" in the most normalized Tim Burton aesthetic serial show since Twilight was invented. Wednesday herself has very little to say, as the secondary cast hold the show hostage with color-by-numbers social squabbles. If S2 doesn't convince you that 80s irreverence is dead, you may as well go back to watching Disney shows. Burton is now boring, and this reviewer is out.

Tyler's character needs to be further explored - his storyline is complex and fascinating, only second to Wednesday herself among other characters. Romantic angle between Wednesday and Tyler was largely missing from the season 2 but we should witness its come back in season 3 with Tyler's redemption. I would see this couple working well together on solving mysteries along with Wednesday's friends in school.
It is good to see a strong friendship bond between Wednesday and Enid, so Wednesday is capable of emotions, be it friendship or love. I hope she will understand that her closing up on emotions made her lose/not fully discover her power.
Overall, I preferred season 1 as it featured some beautiful exploration of teenage love and friendship. That was missing from season 2.

Can't wait for the next season. Enid didn't appear much in this season as it was more about Wednesday and the new villain, Issac/Slurp. The entire cast's performance has made it really easy to watch episode after episode. Agnes and Enid's dance during the gala was such a cool ploy to steal Dort's watch. He definitely went out with a bang. That last episode with Issac vs Thing was really intense and also kudos to the actor for making it so believable.

The plot is much weaker than the first season. I'm still not completely sold on the cast. But the visuals are definitely top-notch.

Season 2 was such a disappointment! I can't decide if there was too much going on, or just not enough that interested me. The series went all in on intensity from the start but, without any light and shade, I found myself just not caring about any of the characters. By the time the second load of episodes dropped (hate it when they split a series just to stay relevant!) I realised I'd mentally signed out of the show. I gave it another shot, but soon stopped watching completely. What a shame!
