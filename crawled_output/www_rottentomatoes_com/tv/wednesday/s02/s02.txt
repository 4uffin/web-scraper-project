What to Know
Critics Consensus
Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.

TIME Magazine
It’s all pretty delightful for those of us who are old enough to appreciate not just the referential casting, but also the just-campy-enough performances that Buscemi, Matarazzo, and the rest deliver.

Slate
The lack of a romantic plot for our lugubrious heroine is the biggest change so far between Wednesday Seasons 1 and 2. Hell, it might even be the only major narrative change, and it’s surprisingly refreshing.

If television is losing eyeballs in the digital era, then Wednesday appears to have cracked the code to retaining them.

Despite the myriad subplots and annoying digressions, the series’ momentum is brisk and keeps your attention.

Driven by a star making turn by Evie Templeton in a breakthrough performance, the second season of Wednesday has enough surprises in store to get you pulled in the right direction.

Ortega is a star, but the plotlines that surround her character need work.

After the excellent first series, this one is pretty disappointing. The script is the main problem here, resulting in a lot of painful over-explanations of plotlines, rather than relying on the more subtle ability of a actor to develop a story. It results in a lot of unconvincing, forced performances from usually very capable actors. Joanna Lumley steals the show though, with her highly enjoyable portrayal of grandmama, even a dodgy script can't phase her.

wednesday addams, an icon as always! this season was way long overdue, and i think that’s one of the main problems. almost three years since the first one and it showed. plus, the division of the season in two parts didn’t help. with that aside, the series felt a little too long, and not only because of the length of the episodes, but also the story. sometimes it felt like it was going nowhere. the second part really picked things up and in the end, in whole addams fashions, things turned out crazier than initially thought, but in their favor as always. the costume, production and setting, impeccable as ever. as well as the guest stars, old and new cast members. jenna ortega was born to play this psycho, and this season consolidated that idea. in the end, i think it managed to be somehow memorable, but season three needs to come sooner, or maybe it’s best to ends things right just there!!! it was a woe of a time indeed!

Enjoyed every minute of every episode. It's good to know that, with all the pretentious, bombastic shows on TV and streaming, there are still shows that are cleverly written, directed with attention and wonderfully acted in.

Season 1 had so much potential with Bianca specifically and morning star. Season 2 washed that down the drain in seconds. Her mom and Gideon are completely forgettable.
The plot makes 0 sense. The big bad dies 4 episodes in and is replaced by the most obvious bad in the new show.
Just bad.

I very much enjoyed season 1 as it was witty, well written and had the right balance between comedy and darkness/mystery. The characters were well written and their fears and worries were relatable.
Season 2, however, was a disappointment.
The plot is a mess, the writing and dialogues are poor and the characters became quite cringe. I found it hard to relate to or care for the characters this season and the plot was sometimes hard to follow. That's sad, since there was so much potential and the banter of the Addams family was really fun in season 1.
