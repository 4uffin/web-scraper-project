Critics Consensus
Wednesday's second season smartly opens up to include more of the whole Addams clan, backing up Jenna Ortega's lovably heartless teenager with an ookier and spookier ensemble.

TIME Magazine
It’s all pretty delightful for those of us who are old enough to appreciate not just the referential casting, but also the just-campy-enough performances that Buscemi, Matarazzo, and the rest deliver.

Slate
The lack of a romantic plot for our lugubrious heroine is the biggest change so far between Wednesday Seasons 1 and 2. Hell, it might even be the only major narrative change, and it’s surprisingly refreshing.

If television is losing eyeballs in the digital era, then Wednesday appears to have cracked the code to retaining them.
Rated: 4/5

Sarah's Backstage Pass
Beyond the plot twists, the performances elevate the season. Every actor breathes new life into their character, the show widens the spotlight to showcase more than just Wednesday’s perspective. This shift gives the world of Nevermore greater dimension.
Rated: 4/4

Despite the myriad subplots and annoying digressions, the series’ momentum is brisk and keeps your attention.

Driven by a star making turn by Evie Templeton in a breakthrough performance, the second season of Wednesday has enough surprises in store to get you pulled in the right direction.

I have enjoyed the various Addams family tv shows and movies over the years, and I was astounded at how much I liked Wednesday Season 1. I didn't think they'd get it right, but it was excellent. Of course I was excited when Season 2 rolled out, until I clicked play. They ruined it all. Sure the Addams family are ooky and spooky, but they are subversive in all the right ways too. The kids are always encouraged, not criticized, and the parents genuinely like and love one another and keep the passion alive despite being in a middle-aged marriage. Right off the bat, this version of the Addams family has Morticia browbeating Wednesday about something stupid, then whispering to her that she lets her husband THINK he runs the family. Later the whole family threatens to eject Pugsley out of the car if he doesn't perform a trick just right. Sure, they might eject a kid as a JOKE, but never as a group grudge.
To top off my niche concerns, everything about this season is just a watered down repeat of season 1. So, no, just no.

Much of the dark appeal from S1 missing and some obvious missteps (eg Wednesday using a bow for playing but one with a yellow handle or Morticia in the red-lined dress in just ep.1?). The condescending pauses with no expression before Wednesday speaks are gone. The character is openly showing surprise, reacting ‘normally’ or showing feeling. Further let down by a choppy disjointed plot line. Loved S1 - S2 very meh.

Long time Tim Burton fan. I’m glad he has entered the TV game because he does it with success. The story has his flair in every way, haunting with a touch of humor and morality. He has stepped up the gore and horror in his most recent pieces but you still know it’s Tim Burton. I also enjoy how deep the story is developing each season. Great show!

Excellent series and stays true to the original 'Adams Family' TV series from the 1960's.
Comedy, suspense, horror, and teen/family drama all wrapped up into one very original series.
The acting and script/plots are well done.
In fact, within each series there are multiple plots - not just one plot that encompasses the whole season. In season 2, there are five distinct story-lines that come to a conclusion and a new story lines added and left open in the last episode to set up season 3.
My overall take is that this is a 'fun' show to watch for the whole family.

The S
This genuinely feels like it was written episode by episode without any rhyme or reason to an actual story. There’s no real plot here, unfortunately. I know it’s basically a kid’s show but all the CGI effects in the world couldn’t help this season.
It’s interesting because we’ve seen some series really develop to the point where they’ve become basically movies that are broken up into smaller chunks..the series as an art has really developed and evolved.
Not here. This one is awful this time around. Last season was watchable because there was an actual thread running through with some type of storyline. They lost that in this season and each episode just jumps around without any development and without any regard to an actual story.
And Netflix breaking it up with a month long hiatus between the story only made that worse. If you thought keeping track of a bunch of random episodes without a plot is tough, wait until you try it with a monthlong break between them.
