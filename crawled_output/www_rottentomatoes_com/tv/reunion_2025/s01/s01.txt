J. Kelly Nestruck
Globe and Mail
It's a solid thriller in structure but strongest in the specifics of its setting, taking place largely in a deaf community in northern England. Gurney gives a compelling central performance as a slippery character who will make your sympathy see-saw.

... it’s a tale that’s been told for centuries. But never quite like this.
Rated: 4/5

Ben Dowell
The Times (UK)
Above all, though, it is a well-worked thriller, not a pious BBC invocation to eat your greens and spread awareness about disability (although it does that very well).
Rated: 4/5

Barbara Ellen
Observer (UK)
While the plot gets a little convoluted, the performances feel real. The deaf element (long emotional conversations are signed) gives Reunion a sense of harrowing isolation, with occasional muffled sounds adding to the intensity.
Rated: 3/5

Alison Rowat
The Herald (Scotland)
Gurney is impressive as the anti-hero of the piece, a man given to explosions of temper and at the same time tenderness, as in the scenes with his estranged daughter.
Rated: 3/5

Duff, Marsan and Ayling-Ellis are the big names but the charismatic Gurney is a revelation in the lead role, with an intense performance that wavers between volatility and vulnerability.
Rated: 4/5
