... it’s a tale that’s been told for centuries. But never quite like this.
Rated: 4/5

Ben Dowell
The Times (UK)
Above all, though, it is a well-worked thriller, not a pious BBC invocation to eat your greens and spread awareness about disability (although it does that very well).
Rated: 4/5

Vicky Jessop
London Evening Standard
There isn’t too much plot, but the show takes its sweet time getting through it. What is more interesting is the way Reunion plays the idea of what it means to be deaf in a world that’s not designed for deaf people.
Rated: 4/5

Observer (UK)
While the plot gets a little convoluted, the performances feel real. The deaf element (long emotional conversations are signed) gives Reunion a sense of harrowing isolation, with occasional muffled sounds adding to the intensity.
Rated: 3/5

Alison Rowat
The Herald (Scotland)
Gurney is impressive as the anti-hero of the piece, a man given to explosions of temper and at the same time tenderness, as in the scenes with his estranged daughter.
Rated: 3/5

Duff, Marsan and Ayling-Ellis are the big names but the charismatic Gurney is a revelation in the lead role, with an intense performance that wavers between volatility and vulnerability.
Rated: 4/5
