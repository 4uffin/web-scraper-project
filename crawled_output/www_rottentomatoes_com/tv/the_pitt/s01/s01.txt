Binging “The Pitt” allows us to remember that we’re watching one day, and one place, where a whole lot of short-sighted and greedy legislative decisions flock, leaving it to a group of dedicated people to patch up the victims -- us -- and keep going.

All in all, it was a very sharp season of television with outstanding performances across the board.

It’s already without question the finest example of the genre in more than a generation.

With a stellar cast, its gritty, realistic look at the state of healthcare in America and a relentless pace, The Pitt is simultaneously heartfelt and brutal.

This show doesn’t just flirt with your worries – it drags your fears into a trauma bay, hooks them up to monitors, and lets them flatline right in front of you.

Jeremy B.
Extremely overrated. A easygoing series, but absolutely nothing revolutionary and subpar acting. Feels like we’ve seen 10 different iterations of a medical drama by now and The Pitt offers nothing fresh.

A show that seems so smart with moments of total stupidity. I think the writers may have let their kids come up with the dialogue for certain scenes. And some decent actors randomly completely forget their craft. Also, I’m tired of the checklist of social issues that apparently every show has to address. And it’s not even that I disagree with their portrayal or politics. It just never feels genuine and distracts from the storytelling that isn’t constantly trying to make a statement. HBO is guilty of doing this with every new show and it’s enough already. I heard such great things about this show, but honestly it’s just another soap opera that could have been excellent, but leaves me rolling my eyes.

I'm only partway through season one and had to stop for a break. The acting is good, they cast this well.
There's a lot of action and verry little break in it, so with all the yelling of medical terms it gets tiring.
It's very realistic though even if the storyline is a little predictable.
