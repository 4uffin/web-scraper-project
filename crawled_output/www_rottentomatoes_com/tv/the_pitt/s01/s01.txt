Binging ‚ÄúThe Pitt‚Äù allows us to remember that we‚Äôre watching one day, and one place, where a whole lot of short-sighted and greedy legislative decisions flock, leaving it to a group of dedicated people to patch up the victims -- us -- and keep going.

All in all, it was a very sharp season of television with outstanding performances across the board.

With a stellar cast, its gritty, realistic look at the state of healthcare in America and a relentless pace, The Pitt is simultaneously heartfelt and brutal.

This show doesn‚Äôt just flirt with your worries ‚Äì it drags your fears into a trauma bay, hooks them up to monitors, and lets them flatline right in front of you.

I didn't expect to enjoy it so much. The cast was fantastic at bringing their characters to life. I felt like I was an outside observer following around the ER team as they dealt with a range of cases. The last few episodes were very intense, fast paced and high stakes. I think this show did a good job of highlighting the stress and issues that healthcare professionals deal with on a daily basis and hopefully this will inspire a positive change in the general public in their attitudes towards healthcare professionals. Looking forward to a second season.

Uma s√©rie excepcional, personagens aprofundados, tens√£o a cada instante e uma forma diferente de abordar a temporada tratando cada epis√≥dio como 1 hora do plant√£o. Para voc√™ que curte s√©ries m√©dicas n√£o ir√° se decepcionar com The Pitt.

I think this series will be around for the long haul, absolutely brilliant acting across the board
with Noah R stealing the show. A few of the young cast members also really did an excellent job. üëè
this show really gives you a few moments to take pause and reflect on current culture.
I thoroughly enjoyed the entire first season.

Started out great then it started following the Hollywood sheep with F Bombs every other word. One day maybe they‚Äôll learn this really shows their intelligence. This doesn‚Äôt make for good entertainment just lets me know people are getting dumber by the day.

Extremely overrated. A easygoing series, but absolutely nothing revolutionary and subpar acting. Feels like we‚Äôve seen 10 different iterations of a medical drama by now and The Pitt offers nothing fresh.
