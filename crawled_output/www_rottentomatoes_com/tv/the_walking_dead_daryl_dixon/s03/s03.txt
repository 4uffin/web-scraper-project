After a capsized Daryl Dixon washes ashore in France, he struggles to piece together how he got there and why. His arrival in France raises the ire of leaders within an autocratic movement centered in Paris, and endangers a young boy at the heart of a benevolent religious movement called the Union of Hope. Daryl agrees to shepherd the child and his caretakers on their pilgrimage to the Nest, a sanctuary that promises safety, in return for the Union's help securing him passage back to America. The series tracks Daryl's journey, fighting his way through the unique Walker strains and provincial violence of France. Along the way, Daryl finds his desire to return home complicated by the new connections he forms and the renewed sense of hope these relationships give him. Meanwhile, back in America, Carol Peletier's search for Daryl forces her to confront old trauma, as she enlists a new ally under false pretenses to help her.

This remains the role that Reedus was born to play, and, 15 years in, he seems to know it.
Rated: 7/10

There's one particular character with some annoying traits, and the actual ending might elicit some groans, but overall it's a strong, action-packed season.
Rated: 7/10

Daryl and Carol’s synergy — in battle, in laughter, and in heart — is the season’s beating pulse, a testament to enduring loyalty and the poetry of companionship.

I liked season 1 and 2. Not feeling it this time, but maybe I'll come around to it.

MARIA ELVIRA C
Este capitulo ha superado todas mis expectativas y marca un inicio espectacular para la nueva etapa de la serie. Este episodio, que nos transporta a España, se siente como una bocanada de aire fresco para la franquicia, combinando la esencia que tanto amamos con un escenario y una mitología totalmente nuevos.
Desde el primer minuto, la serie nos sumerge en la vibrante y a la vez desolada atmósfera española. Las locaciones son un personaje más: desde las estrechas calles de pueblos medievales hasta los impresionantes paisajes naturales, todo está filmado con una cinematografía de primer nivel que le da a la serie una identidad visual única. Este cambio de aires no es solo estético; influye directamente en la narrativa, presentando nuevos desafíos y tipos de caminantes adaptados al entorno.
El regreso de Carol al lado de Daryl es, sin duda, el plato fuerte. Su dinámica es tan natural y auténtica como siempre, y verlos interactuar en este nuevo contexto es pura magia. El episodio hace un excelente trabajo al establecer sus motivaciones y la nueva misión que los une. La química entre Norman Reedus y Melissa McBride sigue siendo insuperable, y sus conversaciones, llenas de historia y complicidad, nos recuerdan por qué estos personajes son tan queridos.
Además, el episodio introduce a nuevos personajes locales que se sienten genuinos y bien desarrollados, así como una nueva facción de antagonistas que prometen ser una amenaza muy distinta a las que hemos visto en el pasado. Su mitología y sus métodos de supervivencia son fascinantes y nos dejan con ganas de saber más.
En resumen, el primer capítulo de esta nueva temporada es un éxito rotundo. Es un inicio emocionante que combina a la perfección la acción, la exploración de un nuevo mundo y, sobre todo, la profunda conexión entre Daryl y Carol. Si te ha gustado la serie hasta ahora, este episodio te volará la cabeza y te confirmará que esta historia aún tiene mucho que ofrecer.

I’m always here for Daryl. Even more so for Daryl and Carol. There’s a lot that I wish would happen but I can set that aside to appreciate it for what it is. Top tier acting, beautiful cinematography, and storylines on top of the usual living vs dead. I’m hooked.
