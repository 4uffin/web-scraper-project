The Peabody Award-winning and critically acclaimed series follows Sam, a true Kansan on the surface who, beneath it all, struggles to fit the hometown mold and its expectations. As she grapples with loss and acceptance, Sam finds a saving grace in singing. It leads her on a journey to discover herself and a community of outsiders who don't fit in but don't give up, proving that finding like-minded people and a voice is always possible. The series explores the themes of change and growth against all odds.

[Somebody Somewhere] has done its own beautiful thing for two series, with a third and final one now arriving quietly, unobtrusively and rather brilliantly.
Rated: 5/5

It is remarkable the extent to which this show can and does burrow into your heart.

It’s a singular experience that, even now in its final bow, is hard to describe, much less gab about with others.

It’s a slice of the lovely kind of life that proves you’re never too old to open your heart and start again.

Robert W. Butler
Butler's Cinema Scene
Fans of humanistic comedy should make a beeline for all three seasons of “Somebody Somewhere,” an endearing and rudely hilarious series about life’s losers. Or are they?

With its third and final season, it ends as it began: portraying the vital necessity of true friendship, especially later in life.

This show— derivative of countless other series and as forgettable as the fourth Marx brother—somehow got three seasons while flawed gems got axed.

I'm going to miss this show. The characters were brought to life by the actors and writers and seemed brilliantly and touchingly real. I'm glad this season ended with most of the characters finding themselves and some peace within their lives.

I just binge watched this series and I'm truly disappointed that another season isn't coming.
What a simple, straightforward, honest look at friends who are navigating through a new world.
I love the characters, and really wanted to know more of what was going to happen.
Crude at times (well, many times - but still somehow funny), but I am going to miss this series very much.
Top ratings for acting, directing, cinematography and writing.
All brilliant.

This season finally gave a little bit more depth in Sam's psyche. Show portrayed friendships and the challenge of single friend, friend with a partner finding balance and i am happy to see that on TV. Friendship completely lost focus in today's cinema and tv world.
