... this third run certainly does not live up to the greatness of Alice in Borderland's first season. It doesn‚Äôt even fall in the same category as the more messy Season 2.
Rated: 5/10

Heaven of Horror
The setting for this third season is intelligent and intriguing, and while episode 1 sets the stage, episode 2 will remind you of the horrors of the games in the borderland.
Rated: 4/5

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
Even after three seasons of watching the characters discover loopholes that could lead to a sure death, it remains enthralling.

Far darker (and even a bit more cynical), the third season of this incredibly imaginative Manga-based series manages to both captivate, and even terrify as our heroes once again venture into the games. Twice as brutal and unforgiving as the former two seasons, it's also admittedly a harder watch. Painful, and gut-punching... much of the heart and charm of the first two seasons has hardened - almost relentlessly. Regardless, it still delivers in spades with both heart-dropping action and set pieces.

Is after watching Season 3, I must say it kept me on edge the entire time not knowing if he would sacrifice himself to save his wife and everyone else. I really enjoyed it. I did hope there is a few more of the original characters than that.But it was still really good

With how little promotion the season received, it definitely kept the hype up! Each episode was crafted to raise the stakes as much as possible - especially after how high the stakes were with the face cards in Season 2. This has to be a natural end for the show now - any future seasons risks flogging a dead horse.

I came in to season 3 with a little bit of nervousness and a bit worried. Coming off what might be one of my favorite endings to a season of tv ever with season 2, I felt season 3 had some huge shoes to fill. I still think this 3rd season is very good but my one big point was ‚Äúwill this season feel like it was needed‚Äù. In my opinion, I would‚Äôve been totally happy with the ending to season 2 being the end of the show. I feel like after watching season 3, I still think I was correct in that it was truly not needed but it was still super entertaining and a great watch. One thing that was executed well was the games felt even more impossible to complete this season. I also think this show went 3/3 in terms of finales. I still believe season 2 was the best with 1 and 3 being interchangeable for 2nd and 3rd place. Overall, a fun and exciting conclusion to the show that may not have been needed but is still worth the watch.
