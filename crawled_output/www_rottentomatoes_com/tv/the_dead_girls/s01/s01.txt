Srijoni Rudra
Digital Mafia Talkies
The duration is just right, the progression of the story is engaging, and the characters are distinctive. The show provides an intriguing perspective and thankfully does not unfold like a typical “based on true events” show.

Las Muertas (2025) maintains the classic aesthetic and ethos that Luis Estrada has displayed in his filmography. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

The Dead Girls moves a little slowly, but the performances and subject matter are definitely interesting enough to keep us watching.

The Dead Girls is an engaging but heartbreaking series about two ruthless sisters who reek of desperation and greed.
Rated: 3.5/5

While the plot progression can become repetitive, and the pacing sometimes drags with unnecessary lingering sequences, the characters are endearing and formidable, mixing ferocity and passion into a powerful concoction, whether it be through love or rage.
Rated: 4/5

Heaven of Horror
The true crimes were (at least!) as brutal as shown in this series, but what makes it work is the use of dark comedy. Without that, this would have been an extremely dark and sinister watch.
Rated: 3/5

I wish production would have included the horrendous nature of the "Hermanas Gonzalez Valenzuela" crimes. This adaption says little of their horrific acts.

It is just captivating. One of the best photograph of our decadent society. The acting of both main characters a master class... it was a tour for the levels of hell. A soft "booh" murmur in crescendo until the end. Mexico lindo y querido, como siempre nos muestras toda nuestra decadencia sin anesthesia. ♥️

Couldn’t determine if this was a dark comedy, dark mystery or fictional docudrama. Had to fast forward through much of it or I would’ve stopped watching.
