San Francisco Chronicle
The show’s creators perform narrative wonders in just four 30-minute installments as ragtag groups of still-living heroes come together in a desperate effort to reverse the damage.
Rated: 3/4

'Marvel Zombies’ may be a light watch, but the lack of guts it had to take the MCU roster to new heights is squandered by tonal stale safeness disguised as freshness.

Even with the zombie apocalypse there to spice up their lives, Marvel’s newest heroes are less lively than the arm-munchers surrounding them.
Rated: C-

Disney+’s Marvel Zombies is a grisly, inventive, and occasionally brilliant diversion that dares to go where the MCU usually won’t. But for all its blood-soaked bravado, it stumbles in its character work and storytelling focus.
Rated: 3/5

...Marvel’s most gripping animated project yet, a nightmare of loss and resilience that proves alternate universe stories can be its sharpest tool.

Easily one of the best Marvel series to date. It is dark, brutal, and brilliantly explores a superpowered zombie apocalypse.

Don’t get me wrong, I still think that Marvel is coming back. However, I think this is from a time in marvel where they were still getting their act together. That doesn’t mean it’s bad though. I think it’s on the same level as Brave New World. It was good, had nice moments, and great acting. But at the same time it didn’t really do enough for me to be like “wow that was incredible!”. Solid 6.5-7/10.

This series poorly written and doesn't hold up compared to the Zombie mini story that was introduced in the first season of Marvel's "What If". The zombies are so far from the traditional sense of what one might expect them to be that they might as well just call them something else. Furthermore, they make call backs to all of Marvel's worst characters and stories they've introduced in the last 8-10 years and is a mistake thinking anybody cares about anything after endgame. While Blade is in this series and is the only saving grace, however it is just a constant reminder of how far Marvel has fallen from when it used to be a box office behemoth.

Another wasted MCU effort; taking the characters we care about the least and, somehow, making us care even less about them. I couldn’t wait to see these characters get eaten by zombies…and it still wasn’t satisfying.
