San Francisco Chronicle
The show’s creators perform narrative wonders in just four 30-minute installments as ragtag groups of still-living heroes come together in a desperate effort to reverse the damage.
Rated: 3/4

'Marvel Zombies’ may be a light watch, but the lack of guts it had to take the MCU roster to new heights is squandered by tonal stale safeness disguised as freshness.

Even with the zombie apocalypse there to spice up their lives, Marvel’s newest heroes are less lively than the arm-munchers surrounding them.
Rated: C-

It’s exciting to see Kate Bishop, Shang-Chi, and others back in the MCU, but Marvel Zombies never feels like a worthy vessel to deliver the best that these characters have to offer.

Marvel Zombies feels like a love letter to post apocalyptic horror, paying homage to the greats while injecting fresh, twisted ideas from the MCU that will have fans screaming. Its the perfect watch for the Halloween season
Rated: 3.5/5

Instead of going further and exploring new narratives or relationships between familiar and beloved characters, 'Marvel Zombies' misses the mark, and ultimately doesn't surprise as much as it should. [Full review in Spanish]

Cara, eu Gostei Da Série de Vdd mesmo, eu na vdd me diverti com a série, realmente não é uma série ruim mas tbm não é aquela série que é "NOSSA, QUE SÉRIE INCRÍVEL MELHOR SÉRIE DO ANO" não não é isso, mas é uma série que dá pra se divertir, uma nota 7/10 tá bom eu gostei, a Marvel tá melhorando nas animações, só acho esses traços de What If ridículos.

A lot of the elseworld what if type stuff all works for me, the action is great, the universe that they create is so fascinating and really fun. Has a lot of emotion depth with a mix of humor and genuinely cool ideas and action set pieces. Don’t listen to others that negatively review this project, give it a try yourself, it’s worth it.

This show is a great homage to the franchise itself and all of the new character interactions was so wonderful to see. I cannot wait for season 2

An incredible gory delight! The only issue I had with this series is that it is to short. Please Marvel, give us a second season with more episodes! This was such a great watch, especially if you want to scratch you Wanda/Scarlet Witch itch!

I love marvel animation the last few years. I enjoyed ALL of what if... I hoped/half knew they would continue the Zombies episode. I was hyper excited for this show based on the first trailer and had HIGH expectations. I was really let down on this one.
Pros: Same animation style I like from What IF, they got most if not all of the actors to play their actual roles.
Cons: Every episode had a lame flashback to get you grounded in those specific characters. Neat for story but it was kind of not needed. They threw in marvel characters left and right just for the wow factor. No substance just "OH look! It's zombie...."
I am glad I watched it to give it a fair chance but I would not honestly recommend this to any actual marvel fan. HUGE let down. To add after the entire build up of the first 3 episodes and like 90% of episode 4, the ending was a massive disappointment....
This is just one more thing that makes me firmly believe that Marvel is pretty much dead. They really just need to throw in the towel and call it quits. What IF was great... but that's about it.
