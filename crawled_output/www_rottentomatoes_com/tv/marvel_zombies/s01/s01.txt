The show’s creators perform narrative wonders in just four 30-minute installments as ragtag groups of still-living heroes come together in a desperate effort to reverse the damage.
Rated: 3/4

'Marvel Zombies’ may be a light watch, but the lack of guts it had to take the MCU roster to new heights is squandered by tonal stale safeness disguised as freshness.

Even with the zombie apocalypse there to spice up their lives, Marvel’s newest heroes are less lively than the arm-munchers surrounding them.

Disney+’s Marvel Zombies is a grisly, inventive, and occasionally brilliant diversion that dares to go where the MCU usually won’t. But for all its blood-soaked bravado, it stumbles in its character work and storytelling focus.
Rated: 3/5

...Marvel’s most gripping animated project yet, a nightmare of loss and resilience that proves alternate universe stories can be its sharpest tool.

Easily one of the best Marvel series to date. It is dark, brutal, and brilliantly explores a superpowered zombie apocalypse.

Easily the best animated MCU Show….. so well done!!!!! I’m so tired of it being popular to dislike marvel and that’s kinda what I’m seeing…..yes they had some missteps but this show is a sign of them learning their lesson! Yes the dialogue is rough at points. Overall I thought it was so well done! Oh and the horror was perfect everything was so perfect with visuals! Many jaw dropping moments for me personally!

Overall, it's a very solid series and a significant improvement over the What If...? episode. The humor is much better balanced, and the characters are well-developed. The story is also strong, and it effectively utilizes the zombies without resorting to the ridiculousness of the comics.
Most of the characters' defeats are based on concepts already established in the movies. It delivers a story that lends itself to a sense of despair, but not to the point where everything going wrong for the characters seems absurd.
My main issues are that it overuses jump scares, and for an R-rated project, some of the deaths happen too quickly—although there are also some very memorable deaths.
I felt that Wanda, as the villain, lacked sufficient development. Ultimately, we don't really understand what she truly wants to achieve at the end of the story or why she needs Kamala.
The ending, while a classic trope in horror (a bittersweet ending that leaves room for speculation), also leaves several questions unanswered.

Pathetic.
How hard could it be for an Avengers-level production to write a nice story, following your 5-6 main characters & staying consistent to the 1-2 SIMPLE rules that the production itself has set for the specific universe?
The only major contribution this series made is that they gave Ms Marvel this level of character development that The Marvels movie failed to produce.
Other than that, Marvel Zombies is a story that started grounded & nicely, but ended up being a complete definition of nonsense, with messy plots, unjustifiable motives & a ridiculous excuse for a "series".
I am very saddened to see my favorite cinematic universe in this extremely bad situation: having writers who don't care about their characters. I really hope that Marvel is going to use this gap until Spider-Man Brand New Day & Avengers Doomsday, to make some reconsiderations regarding both their hires & their bigger plot going on.

Marvel Zombies is an animation full of adrenaline and action, it manages to deliver a good adventure in the midst of a Zombie apocalypse. Its only flaw is that it only has four episodes and could have had more, but it is a well-crafted series that gives a lot of prominence to several new Marvel heroes. The final episode left a trigger for a second season.
