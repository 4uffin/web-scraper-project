Alison Herman
Variety
The plot prefers to hammer the viewer with the simplistic image of good guy Americans versus “monsters at the door” over the finer points of geopolitical conflict.

Keith Watson
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Kitsch is a diverting anti-hero, morphing from fraternity-embracing band of brother to an “every man for himself” everyman. Thanks to him, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf has just enough brain to compensate for its overdose of gun-toting brawn.
Rated: 3/5

Fans of the franchise are the likeliest to appreciate Edwards' journey/POV.

The Terminal List: Dark Wolf takes fans on an action-packed journey into the life of Ben Edwards before his time in Chris Pratt's The Terminal List. The story itself is compelling and dark, even if it takes a while to find its footing.
Rated: 6/10

In a world of seemingly endless movies and series about spycraft, soldiers at war, or returning from war, government agents, and espionage, Dark Wolf does nothing to stand out from the pack.

Have one more episode to go. Loved TTL and I’m enjoying this one as well. Not quite as good, in my opinion, but still totally enjoyable. No complaints. Solid show.

From what I've seen, it's an excellent example of a combat action film. The actors' training is evident, and the plot is clear and dynamic for this genre.
