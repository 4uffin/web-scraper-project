Alison Herman
Variety
The plot prefers to hammer the viewer with the simplistic image of good guy Americans versus “monsters at the door” over the finer points of geopolitical conflict.

Keith Watson
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Kitsch is a diverting anti-hero, morphing from fraternity-embracing band of brother to an “every man for himself” everyman. Thanks to him, The Terminal List: Dark Wolf has just enough brain to compensate for its overdose of gun-toting brawn.
Rated: 3/5

The Terminal List: Dark Wolf takes fans on an action-packed journey into the life of Ben Edwards before his time in Chris Pratt's The Terminal List. The story itself is compelling and dark, even if it takes a while to find its footing.
Rated: 6/10

In a world of seemingly endless movies and series about spycraft, soldiers at war, or returning from war, government agents, and espionage, Dark Wolf does nothing to stand out from the pack.

Entertaining and engaging. I couldn't wait for the next episode. Plenty of action and intrigue and lots of twists. Overall, just a fun, well executed show.

While I liked the show, good action, acting, locations and production, the writer's need a lesson in logic and continuity. Some of the script just doesn't make sense. Why is the traitor the boss? Why does the boss of the unit use his crew to make the trade? The boss is on the same side of the Iranians, why not just bring the suitcase with him to his meeting with the Iranian agent? Why would the Germans be operating undercover inside the EU? The list goes on. If I was reading this script as a novel I would have tossed it halfway through. I do like the rest of everything and hope for more, but for all that is good TV please write a better script and then proof read it.

Jack Carr delivers another adrenaline-fueled thriller with Dark Wolf. James Reece is more dangerous than ever, but also more human, as he battles enemies abroad and demons within. The action is sharp, the tradecraft authentic, and the pacing relentless. A gripping, dark, and satisfying continuation of the series.

My question to the makers of Terminal List: Dark Wolf is simple:
Why would you spend so much money on an average script?
It tells you a lot about your work ethic if you slap an expensive cast and costly foreign production just to compensate for an average script.
There is nothing exciting, nothing mysterious about this series. Watching a single episode i.e Season1 Episode 5 of Gangs of London will guaranteed give you more thrill than this entire series.
So my suggestion: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME !

Really enjoyed this! Smart and action packed. If you haven't watched the first Terminal List. It may even be better to watch this prequel first. It does a great job of setting up the character relationships that you see in the first one.

"The Terminal List: Black Wolf" delivers a phenomenal start, with its first four episodes being an absolute knockout and deserving of a standing ovation. Regrettably, the series can't maintain that incredible pace. The plot soon becomes stale and predictable, losing the gripping momentum that made the beginning so exceptional.
