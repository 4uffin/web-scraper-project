Juan Carlos Galindo
El Pais (Spain)
...the third season of Invasion on Apple TV+ develops...a powerful storyline on the subject, integrated with skill and balance into a rhythm that has not abandoned the action and is more focused...[Full review in Spanish]

This is a rare case that, while this is part of a continuing story with lots of characters that are familiar to fans of the show, it’s in a way an entirely new story and adventure.

The Upcoming
The newest season continues to take this globe-trotting sci-fi thriller in interesting new directions as a fresh threat emerges.
Rated: 3/5

Invasion Season 3 is very slow, slower than you'd expect, and although it does pick up later on, it feels a little too late.
Rated: 2.5/5

Season 3 is Invasion at its best yet, bringing in a host of factors to meet new challenges, and it pays off as this group of heroes pivots from defense to offense.
Rated: 8/10

[Invasion] still manages to miss the giant step it's trying to take to secure itself as a prestigious sci-fi drama.

I really like this show because they take their time and the characters.
That makes me more invested in seeing them succeed.
It. can be a bit slow sometimes but I'm ok with that.

Season 1 and 2 were well done. Great story telling. Season 3 did start a little slow but did pick up. Overall show is really good. It is not a major action show never has been. It’s a story of people dealing with a theoretical alien invasion. It’s not a war of the world or falling skies type of show.

David H.
Boring show with lazy writing and unlikable characters that are either under-acted or over-the-top. May be better to just watch the recaps of each episode instead of plodding through the show.
A slow-developing show should actually slowly develop something interesting.
Anything.
