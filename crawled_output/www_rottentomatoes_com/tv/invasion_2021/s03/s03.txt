Juan Carlos Galindo
El Pais (Spain)
...the third season of Invasion on Apple TV+ develops...a powerful storyline on the subject, integrated with skill and balance into a rhythm that has not abandoned the action and is more focused...[Full review in Spanish]

This is a rare case that, while this is part of a continuing story with lots of characters that are familiar to fans of the show, it’s in a way an entirely new story and adventure.

The Upcoming
The newest season continues to take this globe-trotting sci-fi thriller in interesting new directions as a fresh threat emerges.
Rated: 3/5

Invasion Season 3 is very slow, slower than you'd expect, and although it does pick up later on, it feels a little too late.
Rated: 2.5/5

Season 3 is Invasion at its best yet, bringing in a host of factors to meet new challenges, and it pays off as this group of heroes pivots from defense to offense.
Rated: 8/10

[Invasion] still manages to miss the giant step it's trying to take to secure itself as a prestigious sci-fi drama.

I loved the first 2 seasons of this series; season 3 must have different writers - the story line seems sophomoric

Like so many Apple productions, it is SLOOOWWWW. Gave up watching after finding myself fast forwarding thru every episode and not missing any plot.
Somebody apparently told them to stretch a 2hr movie into a 3 season series.

The mystery of the aliens’
character develops further in season three and by episode five the pace quickens considerably.

I really like this show because they take their time and the characters.
That makes me more invested in seeing them succeed.
It. can be a bit slow sometimes but I'm ok with that.
