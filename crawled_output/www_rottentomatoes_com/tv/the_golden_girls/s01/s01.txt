Four mature women live together in Miami and experience the joys and angst of their golden years; strong-willed Dorothy, spacey Rose, lusty Southern belle Blanche and matriarch Sophia, Dorothy's mom, occasionally clash but are there for one another in the end; after all, when the show's theme song is titled "Thank You for Being a Friend," the ladies have to remain friendly with one another.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Worth its weight in laughs, The Golden Girls' first season brings together an outrageously talented cast of television veterans and a raunchy sensibility that proves youth needn't be wasted on the young.

The Age (Australia)
The leading spirit among the women is the blessed Beatrice Arthur. She brings all the energy and wit she used as Maude into this part, her voice crackling like a divine hunting horn.

[My favorite] might easily have been Beatrice Arthur, whose superb sense of looks-could-kill timing endeared me to her character of Dorothy right from the start.

Sydney Morning Herald
The concerns of these women in their late middle age are the concerns of the most vacuous of teenagers. The great deliverance many older women feel from the self-absorptions of youth is not reflected here.

Tampa Bay Times
They're ladies you want to spend time with -- not so much because they're funny (that's not a constant; writer Susan Harris has a weakness for toilet jokes), but because they wear vulnerability very well.

Bill Kelley
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
It's not actually produced in Miami (apart from its opening credit sequence) but it is fast, bawdy and very, very funny. I'd say that's a fair trade-off.

The hands-down, across-the-board best series of 1985 is The Golden Girls.

The first season of Golden Girls is certainly a joy and pleasure to watch.
With a very likeable and talented cast who delivered excellent performances as well as its direction and humorous writing that will leave you smiling and laughing a lot.

Is this the best show ever? No.
However they did things other sit-coms couldn't dream of.

same jokes in every season. hell in every episode yet it is ALWAYS laugh out loud funny and damn clever writing.
Most of this season is pretty good but stand out episodes for me are: Episode 13 - When Rose brings home her doctor friend and Episode 25 - reminiscing about the way they met.
