The Penguin — Limited Series
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Depicting Gotham through bone-breaking punches rather than popping onomatopoeia, The Penguin is a grounded crime saga given gravitas by Colin Farrell and a scene-stealing Cristin Milioti.

USA Today
It's a fully realized story all on its own, which is what every TV show should be, spinoff or not.
Rated: 3/4

The Nightly (AU)
Craig Zobel has a strong grasp of The Penguin’s tone, keeping it shadowy but not grim where the characters’ psychic wounds drive all their choices and the action.

Mike Hale
New York Times
"The Penguin” feels mechanical and recycled, constructed rather than imagined. Mob-movie clichés about honor and service are recited in lifeless dialogue and then recited again; the action often undercuts them but not in any witty or exciting way.

Jeff Beck
The Blu Spot
It's a riveting, compelling, and rather entertaining look at Oz's desperate attempts to become the kingpin of Gotham, dealing with a multitude of setbacks and surprises on the way that have him trying to out-maneuver his opponents at every turn.
Rated: 4/5

Masterful work by Colin Farrell despite loads of makeup elevates this tale above the normal action series.

Concrete Playground
A grounded waddle into the supervillain realm, and boasting exceptional performances from Farrell and Milioti, this is comics-to-screen storytelling at its best.

MASTERFUL AND IMPRESSIVE!!! This crime drama based on the DC Comics character of the same name serves as a spin-off from the 2022 film The Batman, and follows Oswald "Oz" Cobb's ruthless ascent in Gotham’s criminal underworld as he fights to give his mother the life he always promised her. Along the way, Oz must confront both old rivals and new threats within the Falcone and Moroni families, including the formidable Sofia, recently released from Arkham Asylum.
As a stand-alone series, it proves to be a must-see. The show delivers a layered and intricate narrative, filled with compelling characters whose actors elevate the material at every turn. Colin Farrell is virtually unrecognizable—not merely due to the outstanding prosthetic work, but through the menace, wit, and calculating intelligence he infuses into every scene. His magnetic performance is matched by Cristin Milioti’s electrifying portrayal of Sofia. Exuberant, diabolical, and strangely captivating, she steals scenes with such flair that audiences may even find themselves rooting for her. And even Deirdre O'Connell and Rhenzy Feliz deserve special praise as well.
The cinematography deserves special praise, capturing Gotham as a city in elegant decay—an atmospheric backdrop that enhances both the story’s grit and grandeur. And while the series culminates in a finale that is tragic, bold, and narratively consistent, it leaves an indelible mark: a conclusion as shocking as it is inevitable. With a truly exceptional score, it might have reached perfection.

A real hidden gem. Couldn't stop watching and got through the whole season very quickly. Great story, great writing and arguably Colin Farrells best performance ever. He is amazing as The Penguin.

Great show with amazing characters. The plot was great with beautiful scenery. Def one of the better shows. Only 4 stars because for me it's a one time watch series.
