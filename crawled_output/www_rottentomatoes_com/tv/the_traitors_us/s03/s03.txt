Twenty of America's most cunning contestants, a mix of famous faces and everyday Americans, play the ultimate murder mystery game. Hosted by award-winning actor Alan Cumming at an ancient castle in Scotland, they will work together on exhilarating missions to build a prize fund worth up to $250,000. But hidden amongst the Faithful contestants are the Traitors, whose goal is to eliminate the Faithful and claim the prize for themselves. Under the cover of darkness, the Traitors will murder the Faithful one by one in a treacherous spree while the players try to uncover the Traitors and banish them from the game. If the Faithful contestants banish all the Traitors, they will share the prize fund, but if a Traitor makes it to the end, they will steal all the money.

Megan Garber
The Atlantic
The Traitors is all too aware of the world it is streaming into --one where hard-won rights are threatened, where expression is being curtailed, where a new bit of progress is being banished every day. That awareness serves the show's satirical edge.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
[Alan Cumming's] fabulously flamboyant outfits and scenery-chewing speeches help make the hit reality show’s American cousin a total hoot.
Rated: 4/5

The Traitors delivers catty drama with above-average diversity. But scratch just beneath the surface, and you’ll find familiar stories of discrimination.
Rated: B-

No doubt feeling the pressure to live up to those highest of standards, this year’s twisty finale delivered a different, quieter drama. The Faithfuls might have won, but their victory was anything but clean.
Rated: 4/5

Decider
With a top-notch host in Alan Cumming, tricky, high-level game play, and a tantalizing cross-section of reality show talent as its players... Traitors is taking reality competition to stylishly outrageous new levels.

Queer.Horror.Movies.
The Traitors US kicked off S03 with big personalities, selfish players, and one groan-worthy Traitor. All this to say: it's a solid, albeit unspectacular, start.

Enjoying the show, BUT this is the 3rd season that I'm watching with my granddaughter.
The first two season were good.
This season, the language is getting out of hand.
So not necessary.

Is it just me or are the challenges getting boring, fast forward.
I do like that if a team wins they tell no one who won the shield, smart. Alan Cumming is fabulous, wish he did the reunions.

This season is so bad. Alan is so bad as a host. Claudia in the UK version is so much better and also the UK version is much better. Put the goddamn civilians in the game and remove these fake celeberities. Also, the finale was so bad. None of them deserved the win at all. 3/4 of them are "opposite of smart". Also, Brittney, if I was Dani, I would never ever forgive you.
