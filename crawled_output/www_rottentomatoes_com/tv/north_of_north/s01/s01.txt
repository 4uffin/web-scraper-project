Warm as a winter coat and full of lovable characters from an interesting milieu, North of North is a sweet example of a show that doesn't need high drama to be addictive.

...[North of North] is a Netflix gem worth keeping in mind within the platform's catalog; a small but big-hearted series that will make us wonder if a trip to Nunavut wouldn't be great for our next vacation. [Full review in Spanish]

Don't stop after the first two episodes, it gets better.
The actors grow into their characters and really begin to shine.
The setting and situation is a breath of fresh air in a television universe of the same, same, same.
It feels authentic and at the same time you know it might not be, but so what.

Struggling to see what the critics love about it. A lot of the jokes are made at the expense of women. I'm not really keen on a lot of the stereotypes…it’s not so much about skewering the kinds of people you find in remote small towns, more like shooting fish in a barrel. Siaja decides to leave her husband but everyone, including her, refers to everything, including their home, as belonging to him. And she doesn’t have keys to her own house? It’s a strange show and a lot of the writing is lame and the characters unlikeable. I won’t hold my breath waiting for a second season

Pretty sweet show, though a little too silly for me at times. I did enjoy the novelty of a show set in a small Alaskan village though. The show did pass the time, though wasn't something I felt super compelled to binge watch or anything.

Lukewarm first season. Potential is there but not sure if they want to explore it. Story runs around circles which i would forgive if the jokes were a bit better. Anna fills the screen with so much warmth glad to hear show will have a second chance. Maybe this time they will offer us good writing.
And don't listen to the weird commentars Siaja is a great mom who absolutely adores her precious daughter. No woman should nor deserve to stay with a man who abandons her in the middle of arctic ocean and then came to say that she is an embarrassment minutes after she was rescued.
