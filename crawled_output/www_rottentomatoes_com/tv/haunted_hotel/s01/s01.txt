Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don‚Äôt like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won‚Äôt like that one, you won‚Äôt strongly dislike it either.
Rated: 2/5

Haunted Hotel is about non-traditional family dynamics and choosing to brave the world together. And when it comes to TV, that‚Äôs my favorite kind of trope.

Roller‚Äôs deep affection for horror is visible in every frame, translating into scripts that lovingly celebrate horror conventions...

Anyone who likes horror movies will spot plenty of influences and Easter eggs, and the silliness of the show becomes one of its strongest aspects.
Rated: 8/10

Bloody Disgusting
Haunted Hotel seeks to be for horror what Rick and Morty is for sci-fi. It‚Äôs a hilarious evolution of the genre that doesn‚Äôt just breathe fresh life into a stagnant corpse, but turns it into a lively, brain-eating dynamo that runs laps around its peers.
Rated: 4/5

As a horror-comedy that cares about its characters, it‚Äôs bigger, funnier, and braver than its comparisons for all the risks it takes.

This show is a witty blend of spooky & silly. I was hooked from the start about this bizarre family running a hotel of ghosts, demons & cults, while navigating their own chaotic relationships. Just a fun time!!!

Its one of the best show that I have seen in Netflix after a while. I was so much disappointed that when they cancelled final space and we couldn't get a new season but this show brings back the same vibes that I was expecting from Netflix for a while. I hope we have more season of this show!
