Like the spirits that crowd its frames, it’s so wispy that it might go right through you without leaving any impression at all.

Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don’t like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won’t like that one, you won’t strongly dislike it either.
Rated: 2/5

You get stand-up comedians that really get to show their stuff. And Will Forte, I think, really does a great job in this series. But I can't overcome this feeling of familiarity.

There are definitely a couple of solid jokes every episode. There's definitely some really fantastic world building, which, again, was unexpected. And just in general, there are things that make it worth watching.

There's a lot of moving parts, but I really felt they all fit together well.

Haunted Hotel could be funnier, but it’s got fun characters and the capacity to create an infinite number of funny ghosts and monsters to occupy the hotel’s many rooms.

The show is really funny, and yet the best moments are when the characters interact with each other. Abaddon is hilarious and adorable all at the same time.
It's really a fun show and I hope Netflix will greenlight a second season

I was truly inspired by this! It was effortlessly engaging, and I quickly found myself deeply connected to the characters. I crave a future overflowing with episodes and seasons to binge-watch. The first season has become a cherished experience I've revisited multiple times.

This series is awesome, the flowing banter between the characters and individual quirkiness each character possesses that compliments the series. It is a great blend of comedy and horror that makes the viewer watch over and over that also leaves the watcher wanting more. Here’s to hoping there is another season with more to come after.

Very amusing show and I’d like to see several more seasons, kind of reminds me of Gravity Falls with Rick and Morty.
Very good show worth a watch
