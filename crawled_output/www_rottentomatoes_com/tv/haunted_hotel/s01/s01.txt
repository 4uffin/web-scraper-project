Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don’t like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won’t like that one, you won’t strongly dislike it either.
Rated: 2/5

Haunted Hotel is about non-traditional family dynamics and choosing to brave the world together. And when it comes to TV, that’s my favorite kind of trope.

Roller’s deep affection for horror is visible in every frame, translating into scripts that lovingly celebrate horror conventions...

Anyone who likes horror movies will spot plenty of influences and Easter eggs, and the silliness of the show becomes one of its strongest aspects.
Rated: 8/10

Haunted Hotel seeks to be for horror what Rick and Morty is for sci-fi. It’s a hilarious evolution of the genre that doesn’t just breathe fresh life into a stagnant corpse, but turns it into a lively, brain-eating dynamo that runs laps around its peers.
Rated: 4/5

As a horror-comedy that cares about its characters, it’s bigger, funnier, and braver than its comparisons for all the risks it takes.

This show is hysterical and gives off some Rick and Morty mixed with that living show of ghosts that haunt the New weds home. Def worth the watch and I’m hoping they continue with it

3.5/5 STARS - I wasn’t sure what to expect from Netflix’s Haunted Hotel (which premiered September 19, 2025). At first, I was thrown off by the quirky animation style — not really my thing — but by the second episode, the writing and voice acting had me hooked.
The premise: a single mom runs a haunted hotel with her ghost brother, a bunch of mischievous spirits, and one demon child named Abaddon. And honestly, Abaddon is the reason to watch this show. Jimmi Simpson’s performance is outstanding, and the character design and actions were hilarious to me — always sulking, always scheming, always up to something in the background. He quickly became my favorite.
The show mixes dark comedy, ghosts, and even some sly horror references (look out for a couple of familiar dead cameos). With 10 episodes at about 30 minutes each, it’s an easy binge.
A few nitpicks — a small continuity slip and one eye-roll moment with pronoun dialogue — but overall, I ended up enjoying this way more than I thought I would. If you like adult animated comedies in the vein of Rick and Morty or Archer and supernatural horror/comedy, this is one to check out. And if Season 2 happens, I’ll definitely be tuning in.

I didn't really enjoy the show at the start, didn't vibe with the comedy. But after a few episodes, I found the characters really came to life. So many funny gags and relatable moments, towards the end of the season I found myself sad that it only has 10 episodes. (If you don't like Abaddon after episode 4 this show is not for you)

What a great fun watch! The humor is smart and the characters are diverse and spectacular. The writers really did a great job. Also props to the animation! This feels high budget without being a strain on the eyes.
Im a big fan of Gravity falls and this gives me Gravity falls feel!!!!

First few minutes didn’t do anything for me. Shows like this should take more lessons from South Park, Family Guy, Smiling Friends, or Rick & Morty
