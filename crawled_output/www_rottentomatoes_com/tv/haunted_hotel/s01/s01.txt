Some of the synapses you associate with laughter will experience mild stimulus. If you don’t like this gag, another will be along in a minute, and although you probably also won’t like that one, you won’t strongly dislike it either.
Rated: 2/5

Haunted Hotel is about non-traditional family dynamics and choosing to brave the world together. And when it comes to TV, that’s my favorite kind of trope.

Roller’s deep affection for horror is visible in every frame, translating into scripts that lovingly celebrate horror conventions...

Anyone who likes horror movies will spot plenty of influences and Easter eggs, and the silliness of the show becomes one of its strongest aspects.
Rated: 8/10

Haunted Hotel seeks to be for horror what Rick and Morty is for sci-fi. It’s a hilarious evolution of the genre that doesn’t just breathe fresh life into a stagnant corpse, but turns it into a lively, brain-eating dynamo that runs laps around its peers.
Rated: 4/5

As a horror-comedy that cares about its characters, it’s bigger, funnier, and braver than its comparisons for all the risks it takes.

Haunted Hotel had potential, but unfortunately, it falls flat. The writing feels lazy, leaning heavily on stereotypical characters we’ve all seen before. Instead of being fresh or eerie, most of the cast comes across as predictable clichés.
The “dead brother” character is especially frustrating ,his presence drags down every scene he’s in. Rather than adding depth or intrigue, he comes off as irritating and unnecessary. Honestly, the show would be much stronger if his role were cut entirely.
Overall, Haunted Hotel is a disappointment. What could have been a spooky, engaging story is buried under poor writing choices and overdone tropes. Unless there are major improvements in future episodes, it’s hard to recommend.

This was a really good show, the characters, designs, voice actors, and the story of a "Haunted Hotel filled with different ghost and monsters." Personally my favorite character is Abbadon, I love his demon / childish side, I love his backstory, voice actor and even his character design. The story telling is definitely a 10/10. This definitely deserves a season 2 and even more.

Fairly underwhelming. The writing is boring and predictable.
Aside from the zaney characters, which are a novelty at best, there’s nothing to see here.
P.S. - The dead brother is incredibly annoying and unnecessary.

For anyone who remembers and loves gravity falls. This show is for you, a wonderful mashup of references, tropes and cryptids from all over the horror genre. Not overly adult but not overly childish either a very entertaining, couldn't stop watching.
