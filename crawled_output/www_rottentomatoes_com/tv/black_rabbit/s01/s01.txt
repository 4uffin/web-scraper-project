Black Rabbit — Limited Series
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Elegantly plated but over-seasoned with grit, Black Rabbit's unrelenting edginess can be off-putting but Jason Bateman and Jude Law's committed performances make for a satiating enough meal.

The Nightly (AU)
Black Rabbit is not a bad show. It’s even sometimes a good show, especially as the series deepens its core relationship in the back half of its eight-episode run.

Roxana Hadadi
New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Black Rabbit has the same kind of edge that made Jason Bateman's Ozark so popular, delving into hard criminality barely hidden by upper-middle class lifestyles, with an added dose of the physical nastiness that used to be the preserve of slasher movies...
Rated: 4/5

Sreeparna Sengupta
The Times of India
With each episode over an hour long, 'Black Rabbit' makes for a dull watch and by the time we get to its messy and miserable ending, it leaves you feeling quite drained.
Rated: 2.5/5

Inverse
Black Rabbit unfolds over a brutal eight hours, which often has the show treading water as it repeats familiar beats ad nauseum, and fills its dialogue with so many f-bombs that you start to wonder if the writers ran out of things to say.

Not good, but also not the absolute worst. Cinematography is terrible and gray and it's sooooo slow for absolutely no dramatic reason. Do yourself a favor and just watch an HBO show from the 2000s instead - it will be better. If you've seen every HBO show, then just go outside and throw a ball around.

Banging from start to finish. A finely crafted piece with brilliant performances and a pulsing dark soundtrack. If you truly value the art of cinema and enjoy a tense brooding thriller you will love it. Some may find it to be a slow burn (which in my opinion is not usually a bad thing), but there is such a compelling atmosphere and so much detail in the plot that I found every minute of every episode riveting. I love both Bateman and Law anyway, and feel that both of these actors only generally choose good projects so I knew I was in safe hands from the beginning, and I wasn't disappointed.

I binged this one, it kept me sucked in the whole time.
I love Jason Bateman and I thought he did it again, with giving intense dramas a funny and lightening delivery.
I loved the insight into how hard owning a business can be, how family can be messy, and the deaf and mute mafia guy was a brilliant choice by the writers.
Highly recommend!

Great cast, great cinematography, great acting.. All ruined by writing..
The characters are not believable and their
story makes little sense at times yet the overall arch is still largely predictable..
I whish this was better and should have been better.. Had all the ingredience and still..
