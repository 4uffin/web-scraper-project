What to Know
Critics Consensus
Elegantly plated but over-seasoned with grit, Black Rabbit's unrelenting edginess can be off-putting but Jason Bateman and Jude Law's committed performances make for a satiating enough meal.

The Nightly (AU)
Black Rabbit is not a bad show. It’s even sometimes a good show, especially as the series deepens its core relationship in the back half of its eight-episode run.

Roxana Hadadi
New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Black Rabbit has the same kind of edge that made Jason Bateman's Ozark so popular, delving into hard criminality barely hidden by upper-middle class lifestyles, with an added dose of the physical nastiness that used to be the preserve of slasher movies...
Rated: 4/5

Sreeparna Sengupta
The Times of India
With each episode over an hour long, 'Black Rabbit' makes for a dull watch and by the time we get to its messy and miserable ending, it leaves you feeling quite drained.
Rated: 2.5/5

Inverse
Black Rabbit unfolds over a brutal eight hours, which often has the show treading water as it repeats familiar beats ad nauseum, and fills its dialogue with so many f-bombs that you start to wonder if the writers ran out of things to say.

This show is the best that I have seen in a long time. Great actors, great script and action packed. The last show or two really left me thinking about the show for hours. If you have a troubled brother, you will relate. Great Great show!

I’m glad Jason Bateman is done with doing stupid romantic comedies. He is such a better actor than that. This was really good very gripping and very suspenseful. One of the better shows. I’ve seen on Netflix this year. We all have family members that we wish we could save and we just can’t. It’s very heartbreaking but totally worth a watch. Jude Law is very good in it as well.
