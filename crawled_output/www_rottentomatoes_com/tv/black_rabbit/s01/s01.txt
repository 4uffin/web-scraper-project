Black Rabbit — Limited Series
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Elegantly plated but over-seasoned with grit, Black Rabbit's unrelenting edginess can be off-putting but Jason Bateman and Jude Law's committed performances make for a satiating enough meal.

New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Slate
There’s so little variation in its eight-plus hours that its intensity becomes merely oppressive. The show keeps telling us it’s for real, but it’s writing checks that it can’t cash.

Black Rabbit has the same kind of edge that made Jason Bateman's Ozark so popular, delving into hard criminality barely hidden by upper-middle class lifestyles, with an added dose of the physical nastiness that used to be the preserve of slasher movies...
Rated: 4/5

Sreeparna Sengupta
The Times of India
With each episode over an hour long, 'Black Rabbit' makes for a dull watch and by the time we get to its messy and miserable ending, it leaves you feeling quite drained.
Rated: 2.5/5

Inverse
Black Rabbit unfolds over a brutal eight hours, which often has the show treading water as it repeats familiar beats ad nauseum, and fills its dialogue with so many f-bombs that you start to wonder if the writers ran out of things to say.

Good plot and entertaining to watch. Jude Law is great.
Just tired of Jason Bateman’s usual fast talking slimy character. It’s worth the watch just know what to expect from Jason’s performance.

SUPERB ACTING, SUPERB SCRIPT, SUPERB CINEMATOGRAPHY, BEST NEW SHOW 2025!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This show is so good and the chemistry between Justin Bateman & Jude Law is so good it feels like real life brothers.
The plot(s) are very believable; many stories within one main story.
Once you get to Episode (4) be prepared to watch till the end:-)

Boring and I agree with the one reviewer who is Sick of bateman because I am too. Can’t look at his stupid Face, I am sorry but any other actor would have been better than his psycho face. Long hair and a Beard does Not make him suddenly interesting or a good actor for that matter.

Anything Bateman gets me to tune in but I stayed for the incredible shots and chemistry. The supporting cast is incredible and I’m hanging on their every word. I wish this was a full series. Binged in one night and want MORE.
