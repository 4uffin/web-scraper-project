Critics Consensus
Elegantly plated but over-seasoned with grit, Black Rabbit's unrelenting edginess can be off-putting but Jason Bateman and Jude Law's committed performances make for a satiating enough meal.

Black Rabbit is not a bad show. It’s even sometimes a good show, especially as the series deepens its core relationship in the back half of its eight-episode run.

Roxana Hadadi
New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Black Rabbit has the same kind of edge that made Jason Bateman's Ozark so popular, delving into hard criminality barely hidden by upper-middle class lifestyles, with an added dose of the physical nastiness that used to be the preserve of slasher movies...
Rated: 4/5

Sreeparna Sengupta
The Times of India
With each episode over an hour long, 'Black Rabbit' makes for a dull watch and by the time we get to its messy and miserable ending, it leaves you feeling quite drained.
Rated: 2.5/5

Inverse
Black Rabbit unfolds over a brutal eight hours, which often has the show treading water as it repeats familiar beats ad nauseum, and fills its dialogue with so many f-bombs that you start to wonder if the writers ran out of things to say.

Starring Jude Law and Jason Bateman, Black Rabbit is the latest crime thriller to drop from Netflix.
The story is simple; when the owner of a New York City restaurant allows his turbulent older brother back in his life, he opens the door to escalating dangers that threaten to bring down everything he's built. Law brings his A-game to every script he touches and Bateman manages to give another career best performance after blowing us all away with Ozark some time ago. Both the direction and the pacing here are faultless as the masterful storytelling keeps us on our toes the entire time. The violence serves a purpose here as the tense and atmospheric feel of each episode makes the story that much more compelling. Black Rabbit is thus a microcosm of life itself; messy, unpredictable and dangerous if you manage to cross the wrong people.
If you are looking for the next potent crime drama series to sink your teeth into, you will not be disappointed. I binged it in one sitting and I cannot recommend it enough!

Black Rabbit is one of those shows that pulls you in right from the start. It carries a dark, gritty tone that gives off major Ozark vibes, mixing crime, suspense, and drama in a way that keeps you hooked. The plot does get a bit confusing at times, with so many twists and layers, but that also adds to the mystery and tension. The performances are strong, the atmosphere is immersive, and the pacing keeps you on edge. If you’re a fan of intelligent thrillers that make you think while keeping you entertained, this is definitely a must-watch.
