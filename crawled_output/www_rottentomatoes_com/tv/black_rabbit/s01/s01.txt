Critics Consensus
Elegantly plated but over-seasoned with grit, Black Rabbit's unrelenting edginess can be off-putting but Jason Bateman and Jude Law's committed performances make for a satiating enough meal.

The Nightly (AU)
Black Rabbit is not a bad show. It’s even sometimes a good show, especially as the series deepens its core relationship in the back half of its eight-episode run.

Roxana Hadadi
New York Magazine/Vulture
Rabbit’s core is the relationship between restaurant owner Jake and gambling and heroin addict Vince, two men who constantly disappoint and protect each other, and the unexpected richness of the Law-Bateman pairing complements and elevates everything.

The Times (UK)
We’re served up a story that sometimes flirts with the implausible, but add Law, Bateman and a glossy production and any rough edges can be forgiven.
Rated: 4/5

Rodrigo Perez
The Playlist
Between Bateman’s dirtbaggy, persuasive, career-best performance, Law’s weary precision, the suffocating direction, and Bensi and Jurriaans’ unforgettable score, “Black Rabbit” stands as one of Netflix’s most striking originals in recent memory...
Rated: B+

It’s stressful television, and it isn’t enjoyable in a traditional sense, but it’s irresistible once it builds momentum. That’s the model: one obstacle leads to two more, a spiral of dread designed to mimic the experience of crushing debt.

SSG Syndicate
While actor/director Jason Bateman was able to juggle financial disaster, family crises and ethical/moral dilemmas for four 'Ozark' seasons, it doesn't work here. You don't care about these miserably dysfunctional, co-dependent brothers or their subplots.
Rated: 4/10

Grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go. Minor quibble with the ending - the lovely song "Manhattan" played over a lot of warm and cozy scenes just was a bit jarring - seemed shoehorned in as something cinematically artistic they pined to do but didn't at all fit with the preceding
event(s) which had brought it to a realistic and sensible end. Kinda like an.. and they all lived happily ever after at the end of a brutally intense trauma fest.

Black Rabbit isn't the most unique crime drama but does exactly what it needs to do with precision. The set up is slow but immersive, then the final few episodes are drenched in tension and it serves up a satisfying finish.
Jason Bateman and Jude Law give remarkable performances of morally grey characters that make for a very investing well written and absolutely nail-biting miniseries.

The actors are over the top, but I couldn't care less about the characters. There is no one I could root for, except for the one character
who sadly died early on.

Don’t compare this to Ozark.
(I know Jason Bateman did to get people to watch, but that was just marketing strategy.). The point is, this is nothing like Ozark (except for those “hint pics” at the beginning of each episode).
It’s a story about familial, personal trauma, & how if you don’t deal with it, it’ll eat you up inside.
It’s also a story about love & loyalty to that love, however much trauma damage, the brothers had.
The thing with this show, is you have to stick with it…past the halfway point, because like a puzzle with missing pieces, everything falls into place eventually.
A lot of people complain about the writing, the editing, or the fact that it takes too long to make its’ points. But it feels to me that this was done on purpose by the filmmakers.
And I sense, that it was done, to frustrate the viewer and make you judge the characters, without ever knowing or stopping to think, why the characters are the way they are. And when we eventually find out why they’re the way they are, it makes you take a step back to look at yourself, and understand that we shouldn’t judge anybody without knowing their full circumstances.
At least that’s the way it was for me.
Because while I initially had no sympathy for either one of the brothers, after finding out what their circumstances were, I felt tremendous sympathy for them. It completely shifted me inside.
And for this reason, and because the actors were excellent in their roles, I feel like this was a great series.
But again, you have to be patient, and stick with it.
