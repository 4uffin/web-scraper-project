if you’re going to watch 'Wayward,' be warned. You may want to turn it off before the finale and make up your own ending. That way, you can plot a satisfying escape from Tall Pines, where you never have to imagine going back.

The Age (Australia)
There are echoes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Rosemary’s Baby, but the writing is particularly good when it comes to the bonds that tie people together.
Rated: 3.5/5

Unlike plenty of the glossy-looking but thin thrillers so frequently served up by the streamers at present, Wayward offers something far more odd and entertaining.
Rated: 4/5

Digital Spy
A queer twisty genre blending thriller that goes places you won't expect, even if it tries to do a little too much at points. Toni Collette is predictably great, but it's Mae Martin who steals the show (which they also created).
Rated: 4/5

Movies and Munchies (YouTube)
Despite the series creating a menacing atmosphere, showcasing unjust cruelty to a vulnerable population, Wayward fails to examine its themes by minimizing character complications, short-sheeting plot complexities, and all but eliminating consequences.
Rated: 2.5/5

[Wayward] seems like a slam dunk… on paper. [...] The weak writing leaves the show often feeling stiff, unnatural, and heavy-handed. It tries to be profound, but instead comes off as hollow and performative.

While there are weaknesses at points in this story, the premise had me from the beginning and kept me to the very end. This show deserves a second season to let it mature into the show it can become.

Always exciting to see Toni Collette on the screen. It's a shame the writing is poor to say the least and the contrast with between Toni and the othe actors only make them seem worse. The show is, in one word, disappointing.

Really great mystery/thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat. The dialogue was a but cheesy in the first episode but it gets better afterwards. Highly recommend.
