Don't hit play on Wayward unless you're ready to surrender yourself to 8 hours of this sensational series. Like the town at its center, it's hard to walk away from.

While it may not go down as one of the stronger cult stories sweeping television, “Wayward” has fewer problems than peculiarities. Just keep an open mind.
Rated: B-

Screen Rant
Mae Martin's new Netflix thriller boasts big names & atmospheric tension, but its heady mystery and emotional themes leave something to be desired.
Rated: 7/10

A thriller turned series that grips both with its suspense and its sharp social critique.

Karina Adelgaard
Heaven of Horror
Mae Martin has created a genre-bending series that can be watched as a straight-up (pun intended, as this is deliciously not) horror series, a sci-fi thriller mystery, or even a take on true crime.
Rated: 4/5

Alise Chaffins
MacGuffin or Meaning (Substack)
There are plenty of aspects of this series that make it fun to watch: the exciting action, the bucolic town, the stellar performances. But the issues with the script make it hard to give Wayward a full-throated endorsement.
Rated: 2.5/5
