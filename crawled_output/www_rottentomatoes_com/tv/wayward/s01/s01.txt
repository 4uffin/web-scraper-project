Don't hit play on Wayward unless you're ready to surrender yourself to 8 hours of this sensational series. Like the town at its center, it's hard to walk away from.

While it may not go down as one of the stronger cult stories sweeping television, “Wayward” has fewer problems than peculiarities. Just keep an open mind.

As the genre-bending, rollercoaster of a ride series is something you need to add to your burgeoning must-see fall watch list.

Wayward leans into quirky psychological thrills, but becomes a mixed bag due to how much goes unanswered.

It’s not afraid to unsettle, not afraid to make you laugh, and certainly not afraid to leave you thinking. With Toni Collette commanding the screen and clever writing by Martin, Wayward is a must-watch this fall season.
Rated: 4/5
