Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and beautifully acted from top to bottom, Adolescence is a masterclass in televisual storytelling and a searing viewing experience that scars.

It's the exploration of toxic incel culture and its effect on young men that makes the series a relevant, spellbinding exploration of a pressing moment in modern society.

Cooper, Doherty, and Graham, who plays Jamie’s guilt-stricken father, are all phenomenal.

[Adolescence] is an authentic, searing portrayal of the hardships of growing up in an age when the digital world and social media don’t just overshadow the real but manipulate and maul it in disquieting ways.

A father’s worst nightmare unfolds in a single-take series. (...) Adolescence is utterly devastating and bleak, yet deeply necessary and more timely than ever. One of the best new shows of the year so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

Each episode is one long camera shot and this is fascinating to observe.

Sequence shots are usually more effective in action & horror, and even with Adolescence teasing both of these genres, it masterfully develops the tension in a full blown heart-breaking drama. Kudos to this incredible cast & crew. [Full review in Spanish]

The series really picked up in the second half. The first half didn’t grab me – it was kind of boring and dragged on. The acting was great overall, apart from the detectives. Still, if you’re into TV series in general, it’s worth checking out, even though it only partly lives up to the hype, at least in my opinion.

OK, I get it, and the good reviews. The first episode is great, and the others kind follow up, with some (deeper) commentary, but are far from as good as the first. That is disappointing. But, while it is a hard watch, the buzz is great as it touches subjects that should be discussed. I wouldn't call this entertainment, but please have a watch.

Unrealistic, and indulgent with some halfway decent acting. Some parts are almost comedic with their heavy-handed attempts to push an unrealistic view of the world.
