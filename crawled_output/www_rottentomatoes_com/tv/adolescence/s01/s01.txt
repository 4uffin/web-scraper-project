Stylistically bold and beautifully acted from top to bottom, Adolescence is a masterclass in televisual storytelling and a searing viewing experience that scars.

It's the exploration of toxic incel culture and its effect on young men that makes the series a relevant, spellbinding exploration of a pressing moment in modern society.

Cooper, Doherty, and Graham, who plays Jamie’s guilt-stricken father, are all phenomenal.

[Adolescence] is an authentic, searing portrayal of the hardships of growing up in an age when the digital world and social media don’t just overshadow the real but manipulate and maul it in disquieting ways.

The Times of India
“She must have done something to provoke him.” Adolescence takes a deftly disguised version of this oft-repeated line against female victims of male violence, packaging it in beautiful acting, poignant music, technical brilliance and polished obfuscation.

A father’s worst nightmare unfolds in a single-take series. (...) Adolescence is utterly devastating and bleak, yet deeply necessary and more timely than ever. One of the best new shows of the year so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

This series is fantastic. Cinematic work of art and a logistics masterpiece. The narrative is so relevant to the anxiety of what parents are going through and the acting is mind blowing when you realize each segment was done in one take. One slip, one forgotten line at the end of the shoot and they have to start completely over. Mind boggling.

Joel C
Oh my god, that was good! If you have trouble crying, this mini-series is a good catalyst.
The writing is coldly realistic, which makes it all the more poignant than its subject matter might lead you to imagine.
Four episodes, each one hour long.
Not to mention the performance, which is already admirable, the choice is to be commended. You are forced to follow the harsh reality (of this fiction) that is presented to you, and it completely changes the emotional approach to such a story. No editing to spare you. You cannot be a spectator, you are a witness.
Oh my god, it was brilliant.

Marco B
Adolescence is a show that addresses a very delicate issue. The acting is great, but the storytelling is a bit weak. After a powerful first episode, the series loses its focus, leaving many scenes unresolved, which really frustrates the audience. The show wants to open a dialogue about today's problems, but it would have been more effective to have shorter episodes and a longer season, so we could have seen the victim's family's side of the story.

Adolescence is a brilliantly scripted and well-researched series — dark, gritty, and a must-watch for anyone with kids. The struggles and emotions of the characters are heart-wrenching, and it will make you question many things in life — a harsh reality check in today’s modern connected world. The creative single-shot camerawork adds intensity, though the pace dragged a bit in some episodes. Not everyone’s cup of tea, but it will definitely leave a lasting mark.
