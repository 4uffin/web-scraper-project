Critics Consensus
Stylistically bold and beautifully acted from top to bottom, Adolescence is a masterclass in televisual storytelling and a searing viewing experience that scars.

It's the exploration of toxic incel culture and its effect on young men that makes the series a relevant, spellbinding exploration of a pressing moment in modern society.

Cooper, Doherty, and Graham, who plays Jamie’s guilt-stricken father, are all phenomenal.

[Adolescence] is an authentic, searing portrayal of the hardships of growing up in an age when the digital world and social media don’t just overshadow the real but manipulate and maul it in disquieting ways.

The Times of India
“She must have done something to provoke him.” Adolescence takes a deftly disguised version of this oft-repeated line against female victims of male violence, packaging it in beautiful acting, poignant music, technical brilliance and polished obfuscation.

A father’s worst nightmare unfolds in a single-take series. (...) Adolescence is utterly devastating and bleak, yet deeply necessary and more timely than ever. One of the best new shows of the year so far. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

I only managed to watch the first episode and a little bit of the second before my boredom meter cracked and broke. I was a little confused at first, wondering if this was a very detailed documentary on police procedure rather than a drama. There’s not a lot of drama in watching the policeman read the kid his rights in full, not once but at least three times in different scenes (and most of us who have watched countless police dramas could probably recite them verbatim anyway). But the real killer for me (no pun intended) was having to watch the kid being finger-printed. It was marginally interesting as no ink was involved. Rather, an image of his finger tip was taken when he pressed his finger on a clear plastic panel which turned red as the picture was taken. This is how the scene went: Policeman: “OK Jamie, place the thumb of your right hand here and press down until it goes red.” [Click] “Good. Now do the same thing with the index finger of your right hand.” [Click] “Good. Now with the middle finger” [Click] “That’s great. Now with the ring finger.” [Click] “Now with your little finger.” [Click] “OK, now we’ll do the same with the fingers of your left hand. Let’s start with your thumb.” [Click] Agggggh! I can’t go on! Needless to say, the remaining fingers of his left hand were all processed the same way (although not nearly as quickly as you would have read these line). Dramatic tension had long disappeared in the rear view mirror.

Henry O.
Promised so much at first, yet delivered so little. The film starts to build a character and then never answers any questions nor shows any real conclusions. Overly prolongs basic scenes such as conversations for over 20minutes each! just to get its point across about how you should feel about the characters involved when it could easily just take 2-3 minutes and people would get the point. So many pointless characters, conversations, and scenes that could’ve easily saved over an hour of fillers. Boring, frustrating and disappointing.

Powerful.
No idea why fans have this only at 74%.
It’s worth every one of its Emmy’s.
The acting, the cinematography and the storytelling.
Brilliant.

Amazingly performed, and toying with issues that do need to be discussed seriously, in the open. Unfortunately instead of such an honest discussion they opted to write sensationalist drivel with little resemblance to the real world. The youth culture presented here is as unintelligible to actual youth as it is terrifying to olds.
Now politicians are citing it as an excuse to clamp down further on free speech and open access to information in the UK, as if it was a true story or something. It’s not even particularly convincing as a made-up story.
