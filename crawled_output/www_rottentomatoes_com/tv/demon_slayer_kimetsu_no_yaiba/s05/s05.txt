The Hashira Training Arc is what happens when a small arc is stretched to breaking point. It makes every episode feel lightweight and padded to the point that when you actually get to the exciting bit in the final episode you almost can’t be bothered.
Rated: 2/5

This is an exercise in excess and self-indulgence, in squeezing every drop of content from the premise to pad the runtime before the big finale.
Rated: 3/10

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
Demon Slayer Season 4 really struggles throughout the season but does ultimately land the ending and sets up for an epic finale that will hopefully be more enjoyable than this season.
Rated: 6.5/10

Ngl I like this a little bit better than Swordsmith Village. I feel like that’s a hot take not saying it’s good. I think it’s kind of boring, but at least it has time to breathe. And that last episode was pretty good. I’m gonna be watching. Infinity castle today so I really hope that’s good. 5.9/10
