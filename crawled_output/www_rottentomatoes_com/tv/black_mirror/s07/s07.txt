Featuring stand-alone dramas -- sharp, suspenseful, satirical tales that explore techno-paranoia -- "Black Mirror" is a contemporary reworking of "The Twilight Zone" with stories that tap into the collective unease about the modern world. Each story features its own cast of unique characters, including stars like Bryce Dallas Howard ("The Help"), Alice Eve, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Cullen and Jerome Flynn ("Game of Thrones"). Joe Wright, Dan Trachtenberg, and James Watkins are among the featured directors.

Black Mirror — Season 7
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Responding to a world that's become just as technologically anxious as one of its speculative horror stories, Black Mirror refreshingly tacks toward more humanistic and hopeful tales in a superb return to form.

In an ever more app-based world, a future in which the decision to subscribe becomes a life-and-death matter is not all that difficult to imagine.

TV this good is a joy to watch. And TV this thought-provoking that has you remembering and relishing it for days and weeks afterward, that's not just a joy, "Black Mirror" is a treasure.

For a show comprising a scant 27 episodes to salvage itself for spare parts is unbecoming, not to mention dull; a show can only play the same note so many times before the piano string snaps.

Netflix’s “Black Mirror” doesn’t serve as a warning about technology and capitalism anymore – just a dreary reflection of our reality.

If the seventh season tells us anything, it's that squeezing every last drop out of Black Mirror might not be the best idea. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 2.5/5

Del Sofá a la Cocina Podcast (Spain)
La temporada está genial, pero necesita una pausa y volver dentro de 5 o 10 años para ver si puede hablar de un futuro que se sienta lejano, que dé ilusión de ciencia ficción, y no sentir que estoy viendo la distopía en la que realmente estoy viviendo.”

After many years, Black Mirror comes back and does not disappoint. Once again, it's on point.
Even as the world got darker and things are becoming true with the advent of AI,
Black Mirror still finds a great way to tiptoe scientific fiction with reality,
while providing a unique psychological thrill.
The only thing I can say that I haven't mentioned in previous Black Mirror reviews is that certain episodes can apply to a much broader audience than you expect.
In particular, I recommended the movie episode to my parents, and they loved it!
At the same time, I know they'd never watch some of the darker ones. Being able to target such a wide audience is a testament to the brilliance of the show.

BM producers have ran out of fresh ideas. Don’t be fooled by many of the critics. Especially Episode 5 [Eulogy], nothing happens, nothing!
The critics loved the empty canvas they could paint their fake feelings on to write an amazing review that everybody wants to read.
It cannot even be considered a Black Mirror episode.

An episode ironically similar to Netflix’s payment plans, the biggest gaslighting ever, an actress falling in love with a simulation, a gamer aiming for doomsday, an old romance told through photographs, and a sequel to my favorite story in the series! There was definitely somethings that I didn’t like this season but there’s a lot that I loved, making this one of my favorite seasons yet.
