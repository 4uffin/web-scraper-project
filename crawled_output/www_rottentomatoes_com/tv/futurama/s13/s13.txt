Accidentally frozen, pizza-deliverer Fry wakes up 1,000 years in the future. He is taken in by his sole descendant, an elderly and addled scientist who owns a small cargo delivery service. Among the other crew members are Capt. Leela, accountant Hermes, intern Amy, obnoxious robot Bender and lobsterlike moocher "Dr." Zoidberg.

Tell-Tale TV
Season 13 isn’t groundbreaking or revelatory, nor does it do anything other shows haven’t already done. That said, it’s still a blast and a half, and easily the best installment of the revival thus far.
Rated: 3.5/5

The deft mix of top-notch character writing, creative sci-fi weirdness, and sitcom-style relatability that has defined Futurama throughout its storied history is very much on display here.
Rated: 9/10

Even Dr. Zoidberg, a character who usually works best in small doses, gets an arc that shows some surprising emotional depth under all the dumpster diving.

Terrific return to "classic" Futurama in season 13. Whilst enjoying the previous two seasons this is another step up in form and quality.
Got a bit confusing in Episode 4, "The Numberland Gap", although that's more my stupidity than any fault of the writers, the other episodes were all entertaining and enthralling.
Best of all was a return of many classic characters including Blek and his missus, the Cynoids, seen in season 4's "A Leela of Her Own". Still making the pizza's in episode 7. The Whale Biologist and Randy are in series, Robot Santa makes an all too brief appearance, the porno guy, Bender gets a little pig friend, lots of Scruffy........yep !
But poor Charlie.......(episode 3).
Dr Zoidberg has some happy times, which pleased me, He really is a lovely character who doesn't deserve the dislike from others, especially Hermes.
And episode 10 is out of this world......

Smart, insightful and deeper than it has been. It's worth watching. It develops well as a continuation of the once cancelled show!
Reading other reviewers, like Tom R makes me despair for who they will give 'critic' status to. Some of the stupidest drivel I've ever read on here.

Episode 1: Entire episode about couples losing their independence. Not whether it's good or bad just, that it happens and sometimes that's useful and sometimes it's not but either way, it's never funny, unless you were waiting all these years for a Pacific Rim joke. Oh, and the writers figured out that men and women find different things attractive and Bender fights Godzilla.
Episode 2: Humanity hasn't solved climate change in the next 1000yrs and they are going to make the same stupid jokes about it in the future.
Episode 3: Ha, didn't watch it! Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice, shame on me!
