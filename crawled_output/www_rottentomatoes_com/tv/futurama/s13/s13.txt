Accidentally frozen, pizza-deliverer Fry wakes up 1,000 years in the future. He is taken in by his sole descendant, an elderly and addled scientist who owns a small cargo delivery service. Among the other crew members are Capt. Leela, accountant Hermes, intern Amy, obnoxious robot Bender and lobsterlike moocher "Dr." Zoidberg.

The deft mix of top-notch character writing, creative sci-fi weirdness, and sitcom-style relatability that has defined Futurama throughout its storied history is very much on display here.
Rated: 9/10

Even Dr. Zoidberg, a character who usually works best in small doses, gets an arc that shows some surprising emotional depth under all the dumpster diving.

Smart, insightful and deeper than it has been. It's worth watching. It develops well as a continuation of the once cancelled show!
Reading other reviewers, like Tom R makes me despair for who they will give 'critic' status to. Some of the stupidest drivel I've ever read on here.

Tom R
Episode 1: Entire episode about couples losing their independence. Not whether it's good or bad just, that it happens and sometimes that's useful and sometimes it's not but either way, it's never funny, unless you were waiting all these years for a Pacific Rim joke. Oh, and the writers figured out that men and women find different things attractive and Bender fights Godzilla.
Episode 2: Humanity hasn't solved climate change in the next 1000yrs and they are going to make the same stupid jokes about it in the future.
Episode 3: Ha, didn't watch it! Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice, shame on me!
