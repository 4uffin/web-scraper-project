John Powers
NPR
e sense that Harjo's view of Tulsa is akin to Lee's: "There's bad things about it but underneath it's really good." One might say the same of this series, which occasionally meanders or misfires, but whose every episode is bracingly alive.

There’s beauty to the chaos that fuels and follows Lee, a guy who arranges the inventory at his bookstore so that Harold Pinter sits next to Harry Potter. Crass as that pairing may seem, it’s of a piece with The Lowdown.
Rated: 5/5

Fans of Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye" and other heavy hitters from that era will glean a special satisfaction in watching it.

Harjo’s latest is an addictive tribute not just to the spirit of a late friend, but a celebration of the kind of radical defenders of truth we need now more than ever.

Here’s the lowdown: Hawke’s a hoot, and The Lowdown is a must.
Rated: 4.5/5

It works because, on some level, Ethan Hawke has always been a very punchable persona, and the show gets it.

I’ll watch anything Ethan Hawke is in. I thought the first two episodes were great. Equal amount of grit and comedy. Giving it three and a half stars because I’m not seeing anything that would nominate a Golden Globe, etc. yet, but that could change…

Fast paced, funny, quirky. Ethan Hawke seems born for this role. Wish they could find different baddies. Seems like white people as racists is the lazy choice these days. Keith David great as always.

So well done but too artsy and self aware.
Too much business with a hat and a vape.
Tiresome.
Strains credulity for comedy. All the actors are straining to be memorable characters. I wanted to love it.
It's just okay.
