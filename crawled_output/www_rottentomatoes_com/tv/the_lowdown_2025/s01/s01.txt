'The Lowdown' proves that in addition to being a master storyteller, Harjo is just as skilled at assembling an equally dynamite cast and crew who, together, have delivered one of 2025’s best new series.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
With its nods to The Big Lebowski and Robert Altman’s The Long Goodbye, that is a tricky outline to pull off. The eccentricities and the emerging evil have to meaningfully coexist. Thankfully, Harjo does it with ease.
Rated: 4/5

Robert Lloyd
Los Angeles Times
Unlike many lengthy series, which fill time with repetitious reversals of fortune, unproductive subplots and action sequences, The Lowdown... uses that real estate to build character and character relationships; it gives its people time to talk.

Rob Owen
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review
Credit writer/director Harjo with creating not just a complete, lived-in world, as he did in “Reservation Dogs,” but also a roster of unique characters with uncommon depth.

George M. Thomas
Akron Beacon Journal
Streaming is better off for an actor with the talent and substance of Ethan Hawke working on projects. He’s been one of the most underrated actors since coming on the scene way back in the mid-80s. With that kind of longevity, wisdom tends to come.
Rated: B+

Mashable
Even with its moody noir atmosphere, The Lowdown also preserves the hangout feel that made Reservation Dogs so special.
