e sense that Harjo's view of Tulsa is akin to Lee's: "There's bad things about it but underneath it's really good." One might say the same of this series, which occasionally meanders or misfires, but whose every episode is bracingly alive.

There’s beauty to the chaos that fuels and follows Lee, a guy who arranges the inventory at his bookstore so that Harold Pinter sits next to Harry Potter. Crass as that pairing may seem, it’s of a piece with The Lowdown.
Rated: 5/5

Fans of Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye" and other heavy hitters from that era will glean a special satisfaction in watching it.

It works because, on some level, Ethan Hawke has always been a very punchable persona, and the show gets it.

The Gate
Led by a game, eccentric, and charismatic Ethan Hawke and supported by one of the best supporting casts in a series this year, The Lowdown is a revitalization of tropes that were quickly going stale in the trappings of a comforting, dog-eared throwback.
Rated: 8/10

Sterlin Harjo's new series The Lowdown is a delightfully dark comedy, an ode to journalistic integrity, and a great showcase for Ethan Hawke.
Rated: 9/10

Trailer/commercial looked fun. Five minutes in: terrible expostion, cliche characters and plot and wasted shots. Ethan Hawke looks like he's walking through this. I would give this 52% at best.
Seeing Keith David in this only reminds me of "Duster" which is excellent. My recommendation: watch "Duster" if you haven't already. Great dialogue, characterization, capturing the mood of the West and time period of the 70's. Genius and great art. Of course it's cancelled for a second season. Sad it won't happend but it's there for the watching and worth it.
