Newsday
Another fine Hawke performance — and entertaining series — but the character he's created never quite gets a backstory, at least over the first five episodes.
Rated: 3/4

Wall Street Journal
“The Lowdown” has a genuine sense of where it is, what it’s about and what we should be hearing -- Leon Russell, J.J. Cale and even their fellow Sooner, Chet Baker. Throughout, it also has the right people in the right parts.

It is ridiculously entertaining.

Mashable
Even with its moody noir atmosphere, The Lowdown also preserves the hangout feel that made Reservation Dogs so special.

Fans of Sterlin Harjo’s past work certainly hope that The Lowdown would be a clever subversion of the genre’s tropes, but it leans into them, feeling like a kitschy homage that coasts on the talents of Ethan Hawke.
Rated: 5/10

It's fearless and gonzo, easily one of the best new shows of the year, and it's made even better for the time it arrives in.
Rated: 9.5/10
