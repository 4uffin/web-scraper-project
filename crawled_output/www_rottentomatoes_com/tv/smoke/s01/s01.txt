What to Know
Critics Consensus
Smoke obscures its appeal with coy plotting until it eventually lights a fire under its story, but commanding turns from Taron Egerton and Jurnee Smollett keep this drama watchable throughout.

Graeme Blundell
The Australian
If the early episodes are a little lacking in momentum, the highly visual direction by Skogland in collaboration with her director of photography Sam McCurdy is wonderfully immersive and often frightening, never allowing you to not stay involved.

Slate
Smoke is really a volatile character drama fronting as an anodyne procedural.

Financial Times
Unfortunately there’s a certain unsatisfying irony about a show that sends up pompous prose while presenting us with clunky lines itself.
Rated: 3/5

The story that encompasses our characters is inherently interesting. Where there’s Smoke, there’s fire, and this show will burn right through your binge watching plans.
Rated: 82/100

Butler's Cinema Scene
At nine episodes “Smoke” feels a bit padded. But the high points compensate in the end.

The often brilliant Smoke has been one of the year’s best dramas.

I found the series to be very insipid. I feel like they’re many other series that have much more potential to hold a viewers interest..

My girlfriends and I watched a couple of episodes this past weekend, but we just couldn't finish the show. Taron's character was less than desirable, and the entire premise was so far from the real story. One scene was so disrespectful that we just stopped watching it altogether.

Smollett is very good, the rest of the cast is good but lack on screen time, Egerton lays it down a little thick

Man, I wanted to like this show. It was too weird. It's slow and has a bunch of worthless side stories and characters that add very little to the show. The acting is okay, but a little goofy at times, especially the main guy, Taron plays. It's a bit off for a guy's role degrading women and dogs. Pretty cringy.

I really tried to like this show, but it was very boring and dull that I could not get behind it and continue to watch.
