Alicia Silverstone is great in this, and the cast is top-notch, but the writing fails the show at every turn.

Screen Rant
Alicia Silverstone is magnetic in her first leading TV role in years with Irish Blood, which feels just as cozy a drama as it does a messy mystery.
Rated: 7/10

Lacy Baugher
Paste Magazine
Irish Blood is at its most compelling when itâ€™s focused on Fiona herself.
Nothing about this series works if we donâ€™t care about her journey, and Silverstone allows her to be charmingly vulnerable throughout.
Rated: 6.8/10

Decider
The only reason why weâ€™re recommending Irish Blood is that we like Silverstone and the rest of the cast. But the first episode has some tone and story problems that definitely give us pause about the rest of the first season.

Silverstone stars in and produces Irish Blood, entering an underworld of evil intent as complex as it is shocking. Good fun.
Rated: 3/4

I wondered whether anyone with any knowledge of Ireland, Gaelic, Irish names etc, put this together. Considered watching it until I saw the lead character's name...
Fiona is Scottish NOT Irish. (They aren't all the same, by the way.)
Little details make a big difference. Call me pedantic, but a person of Irish heritage would not give his/her daughter a Scottish name.
Very badly researched and incredibly offputting. I might have a peek at some point, just out of curiosity.
I realise this is not a proper review, but poor research can say a quite a lot about the quality and/or contents of a TV series or movie, strange though it may seem.

Having only watched the first episode (since it was free on Prime), I can't speak for the whole series but it was intriguing enough to make me buy the season for $9.99.
I'm interested to see how far down the rabbit hole this mystery will go.
Fresh idea on mystery, crime and a helping of dysfunctional family drama.

Four episodes in and the writing and acting just keeps getting worse along with the story line. I love anything Irish and it keeps me watching, but this is a really bad series.

I really tried but I couldn't watch the entire first episode, I gave up three quarters of the way in. I can't quite put my finger on it but this had nothing to pique my interest, the acting, the plot, the continuity, the setting, the narration, they all feel fake, contrived and canned. It's not really bad but rather cookie cutter, bland and meh. There are just many better things that one can watch. BTW, I read the audience reviews, they're not that good so how is this show scoring 100% on RT??

I had high hopes for this mystery, but I wouldn't recommend it.
You hang on through the forced, bad acting, only to have season 1 end without a conclusion.
It's a cliff-hanger folks, so wait a year to hopefully learn the ending.
But based on this first season, I doubt they will solve it in the second season.
It's reminding me of Lost- tons of plot twists, new turns, with no real ending in the works.
