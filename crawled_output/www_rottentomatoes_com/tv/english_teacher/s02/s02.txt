Tim Lowery
AV Club
To stay with the sports metaphors for a bit, this show’s batting average is high, connecting far more often than not. And at this point, the comedy has the chemistry, playbook, and legs for more potential seasons.
Rated: B

Slant Magazine
In its sophomore year, the series continues to thrive in a comfortable groove.
Rated: 3.5/4

Elisa Guimarães
Collider
English Teacher's humor remains unrelenting and not afraid of taking jabs at the most pressing issues facing education so far — and, in the end, even the adults watching might learn a thing or two from Evan.
Rated: 8/10

Abe Friedtanzer
Awards Buzz
This is a show that’s easy to access and enjoy, not much of a commitment for each of its roughly twenty-minute episodes, going just far enough to highlight some of the craziness that is being an adult today but stopping short of diving off the deep end.
Rated: 8/10
