Ross McIndoe
Slant Magazine
In its sophomore year, the series continues to thrive in a comfortable groove.
Rated: 3.5/4

Abe Friedtanzer
Awards Buzz
This is a show that’s easy to access and enjoy, not much of a commitment for each of its roughly twenty-minute episodes, going just far enough to highlight some of the craziness that is being an adult today but stopping short of diving off the deep end.
Rated: 8/10
