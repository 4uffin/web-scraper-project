Critics Consensus
Settling into a hangout comedy that's content to luxuriate in these lovable characters' company, Shrinking's appeal only continues to grow in this big-hearted second season.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
[Season One] had just the right ratio of unease to idiosyncrasy. The second season holds that mix, but the writing’s focus has empowered the supporting cast.

The Nightly (AU)
Shrinking understood it had a strong cast and invested development into each of its characters so that they all feel well-formed. You can follow any of them in their own subplots and find it satisfying.

The humor is sharper this year; the emotion lands harder.

The strong second season has all the elements that made the first such a hit including wonderful chemistry between the actors, sharp writing, and a gentle touch while showing how to cope with love and loss

KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)
Shrinking feels like a warm hug. It meets you where you’re at, acknowledges life can be horrible, and reminds you that it will get better.
Rated: 4.5/5

Brooke Obie
Black Girl Watching
As much as it’s a show about grief, it’s also about healing. You’ll see a path to another way we humans can be with each other and build community, even in the most depressing of times. And if you could make a show like that, why not make that show?

Nicholas M.
Most comedies trip over their own punchlines—Shrinking season two doesn’t. The cast doubles down, serving up laughs laced with gut-punch emotion, proving this series isn’t just TV—it’s therapy disguised as entertainment.

The show in general is too politically correct and too much therapy talk like every 2 people talking will say something deep that's not what happens in real life

i wonder - S2 has changed for the first 6 episodes only: therapy issues circling, slow development of characters. heavy overload of genital terms, repeatedly, where S1 had a subtle use of smutty talk, just right to laugh hard. new writers maybe? or the need for stretching the script to 12 episodes.. the genuine & open conversations in S1 feel so deliberately frank in S02, that it hurts.
but stop - episodes 6-12 have the same essence and development of S01 again! thanks
Spoiler: A key-scene, the culprit guy, who had the car accident in S1, acts overly empathetic, and clearly hopes for forgiveness for his own sake - i can comprehend this motivation, though the actor tries too hard showing his despair, and repudiates his girlfriend?
all main actors are just fine and carefully selected ! except the characters „liz“ and "derek" - both acting overly dramatic, i understand, liz needs to be placed, as in real life married to producer.
questionable: most characters live in large, perfect and tidy houses in pasadena, styled with elle-deco taste, they wear neat clothes, have no hairloss until 80, slender figures, and the sky of los angeles is always blue-er than blue, no smog. realism? Apple intended audience?
positive: jason segel and harrison ford play exceptional.
