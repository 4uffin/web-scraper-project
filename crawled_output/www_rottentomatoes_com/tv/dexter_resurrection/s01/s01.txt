What to Know
Critics Consensus
Dexter brushes off a minor case of death and multiple false endings to reemerge as vital as ever in a knowingly absurd continuation that rediscovers the thrill of the hunt.

Dexter: Resurrection is the final stage in Dexter fully embracing the trashy show it always was, deep down inside.

New York Magazine/Vulture
Watching Resurrection is, miraculously, like stepping into a time machine back to the early days of Dexter, when it was slyly funny and had a firm grasp on its storytelling.

Watching Dexter prowl around New York City is far more compelling than him being miserable in the woods.

What makes Resurrection so fun is that Dexter gets to be a bit of a fish out of water.

...the latest spin-off in the Dexter Morgan universe. And I am loving it. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the cast is big, bold, and familiar.

Great mixture of nostalgia from the original series and Dexter blurring the lines between psycho/sociopath as he builds a relationship with his son, Harrison. Well-written and fast paced season and looking forward to some Easter egg hunting and seeing what else is in store for the Morgan family.

If New Blood dropped the ball (again) then resurrection definitely catches it before it touches the ground. This felt more like the Dexter we know and love, just the right amount of nostalgia, but not so much that it felt too forced. Bringing in Dinklage and Thurman really added some acting chops to rival C Hall, too. Unlike the last two "finales" this leaves me excited to see where they take it next. Tonight's the night!

So good !it was thrilling and exciting as the original series. Dexter is back and every new character introduced flows into the story seamlessly. Usually reboots are questionable because they attempt to appeal to newer audiences and overcompensate in many areas but this felt great to watch.
