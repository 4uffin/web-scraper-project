Critics Consensus
Dexter brushes off a minor case of death and multiple false endings to reemerge as vital as ever in a knowingly absurd continuation that rediscovers the thrill of the hunt.

Dexter: Resurrection is the final stage in Dexter fully embracing the trashy show it always was, deep down inside.

Watching Resurrection is, miraculously, like stepping into a time machine back to the early days of Dexter, when it was slyly funny and had a firm grasp on its storytelling.

Watching Dexter prowl around New York City is far more compelling than him being miserable in the woods.

What makes Resurrection so fun is that Dexter gets to be a bit of a fish out of water.

...the latest spin-off in the Dexter Morgan universe. And I am loving it. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the cast is big, bold, and familiar.
Rated: 4/5

The entire Dexter series have been twisted but has dry humor for me. It has interesting characters with good writing.

Dexter Resurrection, is a great callback to the original show, with Clyde Philips as one of the main directors (who also directed the best seasons of Dexter 1-4)
Its a must watch and catches a great vibe of the original series. The mystery and the tension raises each episode and I loved it!!

Brought back so many memories! I love the story line and I love that female detective she is weird but very sharp! Beautiful writing and acting. I can’t wait to see season 2 and 3 and hopefully 5,6,7,8,9,10!

This long-running series could have had such a great ending. My only disappointment was that one story continued in a different way. I hope it's a work that will leave you with a good taste.
