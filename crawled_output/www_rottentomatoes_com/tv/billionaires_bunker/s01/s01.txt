Common Sense Media
In a market already saturated with dystopian thrillers, Billionaires' Bunker feels like an unnecessary entry—overly melodramatic at times and hampered by weak performances that make intended moments of gravitas come off as cringeworthy.

We’re not sure if the high-concept premise of Billionaires’ Bunker will play out in a way that makes sense. But there’s enough good stuff in the first episode that we’ll keep watching for a bit to see if that happens.

Billionaires' Bunker is marketed as a survival dystopia, but it ends up playing as a glossy soap opera with a bargain-bin apocalypse. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/10

...to watch Billionaires' Bunker, you have to perform a powerful exercise in suspending disbelief and not thinking too hard to overlook the plot holes. We know it's fiction and we're here to play. [Full review in Spanish]

don’t watch Billionaires’ Bunker; go and watch Silo and/or Paradise.

Ready Steady Cut
Billionaire’s Bunker has a great premise and its fair share of surprises, but it eventually devolves into tedium thanks to a too-long runtime – eight hour-long episodes – and a gradual abandonment of what made that premise great in the first place.
Rated: 2.5/5

Buenas tardes, mis queridos españoles. Siento que es una serie entretenida, pero recurre a los mismos elementos de historias que ya hemos visto en producciones como La Casa de Papel, Berlín o Bienvenidos a Edén. Creo que ya es momento de apostar por narrativas frescas, con recursos y giros que aún no se hayan explorado. Lo más probable es que no la renueven.

Not all of the critics are same as our thoughts or interest. This shows should continue into season 2. I cannot wait for it, really enjoyed the whole episodes. It’s a twisted mind shows that got my attention and curious. Great one. Never ever listen to critics and try it yourself, sometimes these critics disappoint me. This shows is similar to money heist, a master mind and planning.

I dont know why is it so low maybe cause it just came out. I ve seen a lot of goated series and this was a really good one. The plot is amazing and especially from the first episode you know its gonna be good. As for the emotional part i believe it did a great work with many surprises and plot twists and personally they managed to connect me with the chatacters. The cast did a great job, the acting was amazing and passionate. One of the best new and i believe rising shows i ve seen in a long time. Cant wait for season 2

When you first start watching this, do you think it’s a bit contrived it’s actually quite the opposite. You think you’re getting into a dystopian movie when really, it’s based around a few characters in the story line is actually quite strong of the love connection between the boy and the girl is Central I can’t tell you too much because it would be a spoiler, but it contrasts with how the adults at the grown-ups misbehaves which has you Quietly, laughing out loud. The irony of the billionaires behaving like children and the kids and actually being the significant ones.
I would say this when the critics really do get something wrong. This is when you see a contrast between a low score by the critics who let’s face it have to watch immense amounts of material. I’ll probably just have the finger on the fast forward even though it’s their job, Then you have the audience, who are the true Chris, Fix and I was the figures show disparity between these two. Is this is well worth a watch, give it by episode three, and if you’re not hooked in a good way down to shelve it with all those other series that you part watch.
Myself, I am a very select viewer. I really dislike CGI based vests. And I would like anything with a script above a big budget movie any day. I think we’re all getting a little bit fed up of the American tripe that seems to be rolled out. It seems like the script is wrote in between the CGI bits which are about 95% of the back of her cigarette packets or even some toilet tissue.
Do you not find that many of these high budget CGI movies leave you wondering what was that about? And also the animation tends To make you fall asleep once you get to a specific age ha ha.

My biggest issue with this show is how it chooses to allocate it's time. It spends a huge amount of time on, what I can only call "random sexcapades". The show shows us the ever-changing and turbulent love lives of Guillermo, Rafa, Frida, Mimi and even Viktoria.
The issue is, I only really cared about Rafa, he was the only character I learned to understand and liked. Mimi was fine, but she was one dimensional and felt purely like a plot devise, not a developed character. Which is shocking with how much time we spend on these characters, it felt like the least interesting characters got the most attention and the interesting ones got pushed aside.
Viktoria, Frida and Guillermo were intolerable, I spent so much time with these characters and they got less and less likeable as the show went on but not in a "root against them" way more of a "why am I still following this character." Way.
This show gets lost in the drama. I feel like if this show cut out all of the soap opera, and "sexcapades" and focused in on the action and main characters, being Max and Asia, I would have been way more engaged. I didn't mind the plot, it's mainly the pacing and focus that ruins it for me.
