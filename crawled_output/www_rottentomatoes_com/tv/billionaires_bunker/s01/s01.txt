Billionaires' Bunker is marketed as a survival dystopia, but it ends up playing as a glossy soap opera with a bargain-bin apocalypse. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/10

...to watch Billionaires' Bunker, you have to perform a powerful exercise in suspending disbelief and not thinking too hard to overlook the plot holes. We know it's fiction and we're here to play. [Full review in Spanish]

don’t watch Billionaires’ Bunker; go and watch Silo and/or Paradise.

Ready Steady Cut
Billionaire’s Bunker has a great premise and its fair share of surprises, but it eventually devolves into tedium thanks to a too-long runtime – eight hour-long episodes – and a gradual abandonment of what made that premise great in the first place.
Rated: 2.5/5

Billionaires' Bunker is fine and nothing memorable, but some of the drama makes you take notice.

Heaven of Horror
With eight hour-long episodes, there is plenty of time to cover various storylines and follow the many characters in the series. It does feel a bit soapy at times, but on the other hand, it’s almost kitsch entertainment, so it...

Oh joy, yet another deep dive into the collective psyche of a group in crisis — as if we hadn’t seen this tired routine a dozen times already. The script drowns in its own emotional waffle, carefully crafted to stir empathy but achieving quite the opposite. Instead of depth, we get characters so grating you start rooting for the stress to finish them off.

spanish silo, but with all the women knowing all the men are either too manly or are pathetic. the girls are fetching and they don't mind having sex with other girls. the sopranos was a soap with 5 minutes of riveting guns and killing, this is just another soap where nothing happens. there's really no reason to watch another season or even 1 episode. time waster. get a haircut instead.

Billionaires bunker was a good watch. I actually enjoyed it. It kept me entertained. It kept my attention. It was completely different than anything. I’ve watched lately. Which made it actually really good. And I was really sad that it ended like that. I hope there will be another season. Five stars loved it. Can’t wait to see more of it.

Great premise for a show but nothing really happens. Very interesting in the beginning but then turns into a big soap opera. Everyone’s emotional and nothing actually happens. Don’t waste your time. Another Netflix pile of dung rolled by the Netflix beetle.
