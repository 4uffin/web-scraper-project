Critics Consensus
Starring Jason Momoa at his ferocious best, Chief of War is a brutal epic that recreates Native Hawaiian history with commendable authenticity.

Empire Magazine
Momoa's magnum opus cuts a brutal swathe through epic chapters of Hawaiian history, long unseen and long overdue on screen — but you do wish the quieter moments carried as much weight as the barbaric battles.

Chief of War is invigorating, compelling and sweeping and also gives Momoa one of his meatiest roles yet.

Cut from a similar cloth to Shōgun, this grand, ambitious series deserves to call itself an epic.

It grips you from the opening minutes, as Kaʻiana (played by Jason Momoa) faces off against a shark in the depths, and it doesn’t let go until the final shot, when spilled blood stains the slopes of a volcano. This is a story that seeps under your skin.

Exclaim!
An epic series that delivers both the complexities of history and [Jason] Mamoa's finest work as an actor to date.

SSG Syndicate
Authenticity abounds from an indigenous perspective, a nearly all-Polynesian cast & Hawaiian language with English subtitles.. Epic in scope & scale, the cinematography is dazzling and the fast-paced, intense, ultra-violent battle scenes are spectacular.
Rated: 8/10

Generally, I'm not a big fan of period dramas, but Chief of War is epic in every way. Kudos to everyone who worked on the first season of this series, especially Jason Mamoa. In addition to the great storyline, the attention to detail, acting, cinematography, music, etc. are first-class all the way. Do yourself a favour and watch the behind-the-scenes features that follow several of the episodes. They will give you a true appreciation for the effort that went into making this epic show.
Everything is set up for season two, so I'm hoping that, within the next few days, Apple TV+ will announce that the series is returning. I can hardly wait! Chief of War is must-watch television.
BTW - Like so many other great foreign language series on Apple TV+ (Pachinko, Drops of God, Krank Berlin, Acapulco, etc.), watching Chief of War in a different language is perfect. If you don't like subtitles, don't bother watching this show and then complaining.

I didnt know much of Hawaiian history before watching this, I knew vaguely of Kamehameha and the visits of Captain Cook and somehow it became a US colony and I am happy to watch this to have more historical references.
Momoa was great, like he was born to play Kaiana, and you see a lot of Momoa in this one, maybe a little bit too much ass crack but still great.
As I say I cannot say much about historical accuracy, customs, culture but I visited Hawaii a couple of times and is great to know something about the Polynesian people that I may add are great people inventors of surf, tribal tattooing and whatnot like they invented the whole cool stuff and were some of the best sailors and navigators ever.
Series looks great and is very bloody and I enjoyed thoroughly

CHIEF OF AWR is soiled in it's freshmore season. Once you get use to the subtitles, the show sucks you in. They do occasionally mix in some English and while some some scenes, such as when with the sailors, it makes sense there are a few times when it's just the Hawaiians jumping from their native tongue to English and back; very odd.
Personally I think having the 1st episode or 2 in native Hawaiian and then switching to
English would have been the better route.
Still, its a solid watch featuring many excellent actors.
I do hope that APPLETV greenlights a sophomore season , a season 2.
