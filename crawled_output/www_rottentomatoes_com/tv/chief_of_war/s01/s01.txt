Empire Magazine
Momoa's magnum opus cuts a brutal swathe through epic chapters of Hawaiian history, long unseen and long overdue on screen — but you do wish the quieter moments carried as much weight as the barbaric battles.
Rated: 3/5

Chief of War is invigorating, compelling and sweeping and also gives Momoa one of his meatiest roles yet.
Rated: 3.5/4

Cut from a similar cloth to Shōgun, this grand, ambitious series deserves to call itself an epic.

It grips you from the opening minutes, as Kaʻiana (played by Jason Momoa) faces off against a shark in the depths, and it doesn’t let go until the final shot, when spilled blood stains the slopes of a volcano. This is a story that seeps under your skin.

Exclaim!
An epic series that delivers both the complexities of history and [Jason] Mamoa's finest work as an actor to date.

SSG Syndicate
Authenticity abounds from an indigenous perspective, a nearly all-Polynesian cast & Hawaiian language with English subtitles.. Epic in scope & scale, the cinematography is dazzling and the fast-paced, intense, ultra-violent battle scenes are spectacular.
Rated: 8/10

Chief of War is the most amazing epic show on Apple TV+, calling it as a visually spectacular, beautifully well-crafted, and meditative that highlights the success of a world-building, and the ability to ground a bloody, historical conflict in a lived-on and authentic world. I would notably praised for Jason Momoa's performance as powerful war chief Ka'iana, who also co-created and starring for the series, been widely acclaimed for it's blend of ferocity, intelligence, and vulnerability citing it's political intrigue and grand scale, also features a predominantly Polynesian cast and performed mainly in Hawaiian language, has been a passion project for sharing his Native Hawaiian heritage.

This is one of the best historical shows I've ever watched. The accuracy, beauty, and warmth of the Hawaiian culture shown through. I loved the sled racing and learning about the royalty and the gods. I hope they continue to portray this thrilling period of time with such an incredible cast.

A little formulaic and sometimes plodding but it nails the setting and the political and religious machinations are better than the actual battles

Big Bottoms
It isn't only Spinal Tap that promises big bottoms. Jason Mamoa's sprawling Hawaii adventure, blood soaked and strange, is a great deal of fun, a bit boring and mystifying, but ultimately very watchable.
So the big link plays the Chief of War, ex-Maui resident who gets mixed up in ultra violet shenanigans with his fellow tribespeople and Westerners. a bit like Mamoa himself. He is massive and so are the rest of his male cast. Tamuera Morrison makes a great villain, much better than Boba Fett. Only Apple TV would fund this kind of project and they are becoming the new HBO.
