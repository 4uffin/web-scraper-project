Critics Consensus
Starring Jason Momoa at his ferocious best, Chief of War is a brutal epic that recreates Native Hawaiian history with commendable authenticity.

Empire Magazine
Momoa's magnum opus cuts a brutal swathe through epic chapters of Hawaiian history, long unseen and long overdue on screen — but you do wish the quieter moments carried as much weight as the barbaric battles.

Chief of War is invigorating, compelling and sweeping and also gives Momoa one of his meatiest roles yet.
Rated: 3.5/4

Cut from a similar cloth to Shōgun, this grand, ambitious series deserves to call itself an epic.
Rated: 4/5

It grips you from the opening minutes, as Kaʻiana (played by Jason Momoa) faces off against a shark in the depths, and it doesn’t let go until the final shot, when spilled blood stains the slopes of a volcano. This is a story that seeps under your skin.

Exclaim!
An epic series that delivers both the complexities of history and [Jason] Mamoa's finest work as an actor to date.

SSG Syndicate
Authenticity abounds from an indigenous perspective, a nearly all-Polynesian cast & Hawaiian language with English subtitles.. Epic in scope & scale, the cinematography is dazzling and the fast-paced, intense, ultra-violent battle scenes are spectacular.
Rated: 8/10

I didnt know much of Hawaiian history before watching this, I knew vaguely of Kamehaha and the visits of Captain Cook and somehow it became a US colony and I am happy to watch this.
Momoa was great, like he was born to play Kaiana, and you see a lot of Momoa in this one, maybe a little bit too much ass crack but still great.
As I say I cannot say much about historical accuracy, customs, culture but I visited Hawaii a couple of times and is great to know something about the Polynesian people that I may add are great people inventors of surf, tribal tattooing and whatnot like they invented the whole cool stuff.
Series looks great and is very bloody and I enjoyed thoroughly

CHIEF OF AWR is soiled in it's freshmore season. Once you get use to the subtitles, the show sucks you in. They do occasionally mix in some English and while some some scenes, such as when with the sailors, it makes sense there are a few times when it's just the Hawaiians jumping from their native tongue to English and back; very odd.
Personally I think having the 1st episode or 2 in native Hawaiian and then switching to
English would have been the better route.
Still, its a solid watch featuring many excellent actors.
I do hope that APPLETV greenlights a sophomore season , a season 2.

How this show has only an 82% popcorn rating is beyond me.
It is *insanely* good.

Everything about this series draws you in and keeps you mesmerised...from the exquisite scenery to the brilliantly written story line to the powerful performances of all the actors involved. This is a stunning masterpiece from the first episode to the last! Can not wait for a second season. This is definitely a must watch, you will not be disappointed!
