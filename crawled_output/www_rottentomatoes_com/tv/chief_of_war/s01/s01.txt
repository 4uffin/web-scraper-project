Critics Consensus
Starring Jason Momoa at his ferocious best, Chief of War is a brutal epic that recreates Native Hawaiian history with commendable authenticity.

Empire Magazine
Momoa's magnum opus cuts a brutal swathe through epic chapters of Hawaiian history, long unseen and long overdue on screen — but you do wish the quieter moments carried as much weight as the barbaric battles.
Rated: 3/5

Chief of War is invigorating, compelling and sweeping and also gives Momoa one of his meatiest roles yet.
Rated: 3.5/4

Cut from a similar cloth to Shōgun, this grand, ambitious series deserves to call itself an epic.
Rated: 4/5

It grips you from the opening minutes, as Kaʻiana (played by Jason Momoa) faces off against a shark in the depths, and it doesn’t let go until the final shot, when spilled blood stains the slopes of a volcano. This is a story that seeps under your skin.

Exclaim!
An epic series that delivers both the complexities of history and [Jason] Mamoa's finest work as an actor to date.

SSG Syndicate
Authenticity abounds from an indigenous perspective, a nearly all-Polynesian cast & Hawaiian language with English subtitles.. Epic in scope & scale, the cinematography is dazzling and the fast-paced, intense, ultra-violent battle scenes are spectacular.
Rated: 8/10

Everything about this series draws you in and keeps you mesmerised...from the exquisite scenery to the brilliantly written story line to the powerful performances of all the actors involved. This is a stunning masterpiece from the first episode to the last! Can not wait for a second season. This is definitely a must watch, you will not be disappointed!

Beautiful cinematography, soundeffects are spectacular, acting is also very good and even the native language does not bother me. The story is simple and the serie is to long, 4 or 5 episodes would have been more than enough.

Es un verdadero crimen que esta serie no esté generando más conversación, y ganando todo el reconocimiento que merece.
Jason Momoa sorprende con gran interpretación y como Director. Es una barbaridad la calidad que lograron en todos los aspectos. Espero que con el tiempo crezca el fandom y logre destacar más.

The cinematography is beautiful. Striving for historic and cultural authenticity is admirable. Jason Momoa is a strong presence. The series is certainly watchable.
Chief of War falls a bit short of being great. The timelines are wonky and compressed. The storytelling a bit flat. Character development too. Most of the characters except Momoa's and some of the lead female roles are very underdeveloped. Including Kamehameha who is maybe the most important historical Hawaiian of all time. The opposing chiefs are angry, violent and not much else. The obvious recent historical period series comparison is Shogun. Chief of War is not nearly as emotional or compelling.
