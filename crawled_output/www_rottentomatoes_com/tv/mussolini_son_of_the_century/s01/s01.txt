There's no denying that "Son Of The Century" pulls you along and gets you thinking about how dictatorships happen. It's helped by Marinelli's magnetic, shape-shifting performance.

IndieWire
An eight-hour series with the emotional impact of watching the news. The message is valuable and urgent, but the packaging of that message does little to deepen our understanding for or appreciation of the anti-fascist movement.
Rated: B-

Itâ€™s all flashy, and unsubtle, and more than a little labored. But for those looking for a glimpse into the psychic whirlwind that can hurl a people, and a nation, into tyranny, 'Mussolini: Son of the Century' is a sobering but exhilarating watch.
Rated: 3/4

My New Plaid Pants
Brutally methodical in its detailing of how Democracy crumbles by the eensiest of steps, one norm crossed without a word after another until it's too late and nobody's noticed

Mussolini: Son of the Century is, above all, a sensorial experience. A cinematic piece that highlights a sense of discontent channeled into violence by a politician who turns criminal. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 7/10

Sunshine State Cineplex
Perhaps the most brilliant aspect of Son of the Century is Wrightâ€™s devotion to top-tier craft. The director goes wild with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, recreating archival footage and playing with the lighting in every scene
Rated: 8/10

Esta biografÃ­a de Mussolini es una joya de alta calidad, de lo mejor de 2025.
Siento que esta serie me entregÃ³ todo lo que esperaba de la pelÃ­cula de NapoleÃ³n de Ridley Scott, porque presenta al personaje tan polÃ©mico de manera tan interesante que llegas a comprender porquÃ© la gente lo siguiÃ³ y cÃ³mo logrÃ³ hacerse de todo el poder.
Espero con muchas ansias que hagan la segunda temporada.

Excellent. A gripping blend of history and drama. I even started learning Italian partly thanks to this series â€” thatâ€™s how inspiring it is. Very high rewatchability.

INCREDIBLE series. Luca Marinelli absolutely kills it (pun intended?) as Mussolini. His grins, his better-than-you stances and looks. His face perfectly captures what I assume to be a popular fascist leader to be like, in the time this plays. His stance changes depending on who he is with, in order to be on top power-wise all of the time.
It is greatly shot, with nice camera angles/choices made to really hammer in certain points of tension/weight in the story being told. All actors are really great in their roles, though the show-stopper remains Marinelli (understandably; he is the main character, after all).
This series feels especially poignant during our current political and social climate. When I also heard how (not) well this series was received by the far-right in Italy itself, I became even more impressed. I heavily recommend it.

It's a masterpiece show, the main actor is awesome and other actors are good.
The plot is very good, no second to feel boring, it gets your attention from beginning until the end.
And finally someone made a show about an evil man than Hitler! ðŸ˜‚

One of the best if not the best historical series out there. Marinelli is absolutely stunning in his role and definitely the most promising Italian actor. Joe Wright gives the narration a chilling contemporary spin. Possibly the best Italian series of the decade.
