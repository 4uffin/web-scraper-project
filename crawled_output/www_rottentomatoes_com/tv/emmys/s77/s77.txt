If you think that Saturday Night Live plays softball with our divided national moment, last night’s Emmys are proof that the ball can always be softer.

While divisive, [Nate Bargatze's] innovation may have proven a helpful device for the broadcast, for my sleep schedule, and for the Boys & Girls Club of America.

Bargatze may want to take a few notes before he tries this again or, better yet, stick to touring and leave the Emmys out of it.

It was not the most exciting Emmys telecast, but it was dotted with feel-good moments, and to Bargatze’s credit, he did keep the runtime to barely over three hours.

There was a sense that for all of the ribbing, this Emmys broadcast was a pleasurable celebration of an ever-evolving medium.

TV Line
Sunday’s ceremony on CBS was all over the place, mixing genuinely inspiring moments with stilted comedy bits -- sometimes right next to each other. These Emmys were strangely anti-TV at times, with a self-deprecating tone that bordered on masochistic.

Typical pretentious garbage from the most empty headed wind bags to have ever roamed the earth.

It is nice to see that the annual award show format isn't dead. Very entertaining broadcast. It seems comical in itself how many legitimate critics reference Nate's nervousness. Maybe they didn't like it because they didn't know the host.
