Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
The series leans into fan service quips and standard action-adventure moves.
Rated: 2.5/5

Los Angeles Times
What makes the show worth watching are Weatherly and De Pablo, two extremely attractive middle-aged people with genuine chemistry.

The new series delivers the goods so deftly that Tiva fans will have no problem saying “better late than never,” with conviction.

Fans of the original NCIS who've followed the two characters throughout their relationship will love seeing what the two are up to now.

We’re not fans of the case Tony and Ziva have to figure out on NCIS: Tony & Ziva, but we like the fact that Weatherly and de Pablo are back in their fan-favorite roles, and their chemistry is as good as ever.

Alistair Ryder
Looper.com
In offering nothing but undemanding fan service, "NCIS: Tony & Ziva" manages to avoid anything dramatically satisfying that justifies its own existence. It's watchable in the same way the average crime procedural is, and disposable in the same way too.
Rated: 4/10

Better then NCIS, if your a fan of NCIS a decade or so ago, you'll love it. If not, I still think you would like it due to the perfect combination of action and comedy, and it doesn't refer to their NCIS days much at all.
