Los Angeles Times
What makes the show worth watching are Weatherly and De Pablo, two extremely attractive middle-aged people with genuine chemistry.

The new series delivers the goods so deftly that Tiva fans will have no problem saying “better late than never,” with conviction.

USA Today
It's predictable, reliable and wrapped up in a tight 43 minutes.
Rated: 3/4

We’re not fans of the case Tony and Ziva have to figure out on NCIS: Tony & Ziva, but we like the fact that Weatherly and de Pablo are back in their fan-favorite roles, and their chemistry is as good as ever.

In offering nothing but undemanding fan service, "NCIS: Tony & Ziva" manages to avoid anything dramatically satisfying that justifies its own existence. It's watchable in the same way the average crime procedural is, and disposable in the same way too.
Rated: 4/10

... this pivot is the perfect way to tell Tony and Ziva's story, which is haunted by all the things left unsaid during their sudden exits. It may be a shock to the system, but it is promising.
Rated: 8/10

I was so excited for Tony and Ziva to return only to be extremely disappointed in the writing. Why the language????
NCIS has been successful all these years without it. Didn’t even make it through episode 1

Puedo decir firmemente que la espera ha valido totalmente la pena, la forma en la que nos van contando la historia de Tony y Ziva ha sido cautivante, y aunque todavía hay muchas interrogantes de lo que pasó, es un deleite verlos en acción y sobretodo fuera de las oficinas que los maantenía siguiendo la regla 12 que tanto odiamos.
Un 1000000000/10

I’ve been waiting what feels like forever for these two characters to be on my screen again! Cote and Michael’s chemistry is palpable, and I love how the storyline is exciting and fast paced. All of the new characters are fantastic and add so much to the show. I need a season 2 stat.

Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo haven’t missed a beat playing these beloved characters. It’s been very fulfilling to see them onscreen again, it seems like no time has passed. The show has great characters, a suspenseful plot, humor, and fun Easter eggs for fans of NCIS. I’ve enjoyed analyzing the plot, following along, and trying to figure out who the bad guys are. Can’t wait to continue watching the episodes each week as they drop and see how it all plays out. Even hoping for a second season already!
This show is 10/10, it’s so satisfying for fans of Tony and Ziva, it’s truly been everything I wanted for them and much more.

Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly have seamlessly stepped back into their roles as Tony and Ziva. The chemistry between Michael and Cote is still so amazing, if not better than when they were on the original NCIS. Michael has done a great job of depicting a mature and emotional open version of Tony that still maintains his humor. Cote has done a beautiful job of showing Ziva’s dilemma of trying to recover from her trauma while also being a good mother to Tali and partner to Tony. The locations and the camera work shows the beauty of Europe. The supporting cast is witty and hold their own on screen. I hope a Season 2 is announced soon!
