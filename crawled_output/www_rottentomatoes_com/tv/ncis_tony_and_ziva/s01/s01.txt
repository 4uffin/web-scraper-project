Los Angeles Times
What makes the show worth watching are Weatherly and De Pablo, two extremely attractive middle-aged people with genuine chemistry.

The new series delivers the goods so deftly that Tiva fans will have no problem saying “better late than never,” with conviction.

USA Today
It's predictable, reliable and wrapped up in a tight 43 minutes.
Rated: 3/4

We’re not fans of the case Tony and Ziva have to figure out on NCIS: Tony & Ziva, but we like the fact that Weatherly and de Pablo are back in their fan-favorite roles, and their chemistry is as good as ever.

Looper.com
In offering nothing but undemanding fan service, "NCIS: Tony & Ziva" manages to avoid anything dramatically satisfying that justifies its own existence. It's watchable in the same way the average crime procedural is, and disposable in the same way too.
Rated: 4/10

Collider
... this pivot is the perfect way to tell Tony and Ziva's story, which is haunted by all the things left unsaid during their sudden exits. It may be a shock to the system, but it is promising.
Rated: 8/10

Freaking fantastic. Chemistry is so so so palpable. The story line is compelling. I’m locked in. Every week I think it can’t get better and it only improves. I’ve waited 20 years for this and it didn’t disappoint.
