Los Angeles Times
What makes the show worth watching are Weatherly and De Pablo, two extremely attractive middle-aged people with genuine chemistry.

The new series delivers the goods so deftly that Tiva fans will have no problem saying “better late than never,” with conviction.

USA Today
It's predictable, reliable and wrapped up in a tight 43 minutes.
Rated: 3/4

Fans of the original NCIS who've followed the two characters throughout their relationship will love seeing what the two are up to now.

We’re not fans of the case Tony and Ziva have to figure out on NCIS: Tony & Ziva, but we like the fact that Weatherly and de Pablo are back in their fan-favorite roles, and their chemistry is as good as ever.

Alistair Ryder
Looper.com
In offering nothing but undemanding fan service, "NCIS: Tony & Ziva" manages to avoid anything dramatically satisfying that justifies its own existence. It's watchable in the same way the average crime procedural is, and disposable in the same way too.
Rated: 4/10

I was looking forward to this, but I find myself fast forwarding a lot.
It seems like a good premise, but there is something lacking.
I hope it finds its feet and gets better.
I am halfway through it now.
I was thinking a version of Hart to Hart but couldn’t remember the name until I read a review that said the same thing.
