It's a fluffy show, sometimes catching something real, frequently improbable, never completely ridiculous.

The Runarounds doesn‚Äôt work. It offers nothing new to the YA genre, and its jumbled nature makes it unlikely that viewers will make it past the pilot, let alone the whole eight episodes of the season.

The Runarounds isn‚Äôt for everyone, and while some viewers may be put off by the teenage drama and moments of cringiness, plenty of others will happily embrace this nostalgic and simple story with open arms.

The runtime is one of the biggest drawbacks of the show; spending eight hours watching something so formulaic feels like a waste of time.

This was AMAZING. I think it‚Äôs really cool to see the dream of high schoolers become reality. Of course every show has a storyline and fictional components, however to see that this is a band in real life striving to fulfill their dream of creating music is awesome. The show is nostalgic, and offers a sense of realness with each of the characters back stories. The music is also catchy and I‚Äôve listened to the album several times. I‚Äôm in the New York area and their concert is sold out. I‚Äôd love to see a season 2. Professional critics are a little harsh in my opinion.

A great nostalgic Tv show with amazing music. I‚Äôve already watched it several times. I hope they get renewed for the 5 anticipated seasons. As well as new music from the band. I‚Äôll keep rewatching until I get to see them on my screens again.

I really loved this series. Especially since the band writes their own music and performs it. They are really good actors and musicians, the music is actually so good and the storyline is sweet. It reminded me of my high schools days. I‚Äôm not sure it resonates with Gen Zers tho - it has major Gen X vibes.

the Runarounds is like stepping back into the glow of teenage days, full of restless energy, laughter, and music that stays in your bones. It dances between humor and tenderness, making you smile one moment and drift into nostalgia the next. Watching it feels effortless, like a favorite song you never tire of replaying. A simple, shining joy.
