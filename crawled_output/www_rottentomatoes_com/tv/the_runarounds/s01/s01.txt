Los Angeles Times
It's a fluffy show, sometimes catching something real, frequently improbable, never completely ridiculous.

The Runarounds doesn’t work. It offers nothing new to the YA genre, and its jumbled nature makes it unlikely that viewers will make it past the pilot, let alone the whole eight episodes of the season.

The Runarounds isn’t for everyone, and while some viewers may be put off by the teenage drama and moments of cringiness, plenty of others will happily embrace this nostalgic and simple story with open arms.

The runtime is one of the biggest drawbacks of the show; spending eight hours watching something so formulaic feels like a waste of time.

the Runarounds is like stepping back into the glow of teenage days, full of restless energy, laughter, and music that stays in your bones. It dances between humor and tenderness, making you smile one moment and drift into nostalgia the next. Watching it feels effortless, like a favorite song you never tire of replaying. A simple, shining joy.

I don’t understand the bad reviews because it’s a great show. It’s always those people with something negative to say thinking they know everything. Howeverrrrr, the storyline makes you want to see more of their journey through music! I absolutely loved it. Great character development. Great show
