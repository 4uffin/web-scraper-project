What to Know
Critics Consensus
Masterfully managing its two halves of adroit character study and surreal nightmare, Severance's long-awaited sophomore season makes cognitive dissonance a mind-melting pleasure.

Clarisse Loughrey
Flicks (AU, NZ, UK)
Now that Severance has started to prod at these more existential questions about the self - well, it’s only made the show richer and, quite frankly, more loveable.

Emily Bootle
New Statesman
The redemption arc in many modern stories is a character finding themselves; there is no such neatness here. Severance shows us that if there is a true self, it is elusive, fleeting, transformed before you can grab it.

Caroline Framke
Boston Globe
In order to enjoy “Severance,” I just don’t need -- or even really want -- to explicitly understand every part of it. Sometimes, a room full of goats can just be a room full of goats.

William Schwartz
Book & Film Globe
That’s the crux of the genius of Severance and why it’s a show that only really works in a weekly format. There is no mystery if you can binge-watch the show.

Victor Pineyro
Seventh Art Studio
The way this show presents the grays in its extremely new and unexplored premise is what keeps the momentum going. Technically impressive, Severance S2 puts much of its pressure on the magnificent acting skills of its cast. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 9/10

Hey, Have You Seen ...?
An impressive ride that lives up to the promise of the first while also laying a foundation to ensure better pacing for the third. We might not have fewer questions, but those queries are much more focused now.
Rated: 8/10

Faultless. One of the best series of the decade.

"Does it have verve?". No it does not. Just being strange, weird and different does not make it interesting or worth watching. I saw season 1 and was curious where the story was going. Spoiler alert: a slow, mostly boring slog to stupidville.

Season 2 keeps the ball rolling and ups the ante, delivering some exciting reveals and continuing to evolve a genius story. Severance is peak television, this is fantastic.

This show is trashhh. Makes sense cause Ben Stiller came up with it. It’s mostly people walking around white hallways. It’s weird as hell and doesn’t make any sense. Went on too many tangents. I seriously think it’s an experiment to see how dumb we are to watch it. Waste of time

Not quite as good as Season 1 in my opinion, but definitely a great chance to see these great characters interact again.
I assume so much will go unexplained, which could bump this down to 4 stars, but who knows, maybe there's a lot to plan to tie up in a nice bow in future seasons.
Either way, far better than the vast majority of things on TV and absolutely one of my favorite TV shows in 2025.

Jonathan F
Season one, kept your attention by believing the writers were going to reveal all the interesting mysteries they created. It was fine that it was slow and methodical. Season two was the biggest waste of my television watching life. It dragged, didn’t answer many of the interesting mysteries, and went off on a way too many irrelevant tangents. The writers clearly had no idea where it should go or are just not good writers. Terribly disappointed and a complete waste of time.
