A young chef from the fine dining world comes home to Chicago to run his family sandwich shop after a heartbreaking death in his family. A world away from what he's used to, Carmy must balance the soul-crushing realities of small business ownership, his strong-willed and recalcitrant kitchen staff and his strained familial relationships, all while grappling with the impact of his brother's suicide. As Carmy fights to transform both the shop and himself, he works alongside a rough-around-the-edges kitchen crew that ultimately reveals itself as his chosen family.

Having set an exceedingly high standard of excellence for itself, The Bear spends its third season simmering, stewing, and giving off an aroma that whets the appetite.

New York Post
Despite its flaws in narrative focus — or lack thereof — “The Bear” remains an emotional show filled with top performances.

David Bianculli
NPR
It's the best food-oriented TV series since Julia Child's "The French Chef." And Christopher Storer and his other writers and directors present montages of food preparation that are beautiful, exotic and mesmerizing all at once.

The Atlantic
The Bear is still extraordinarily artful... But the show also appears less interested in telling a story than in offering an immersive trip for viewers into the recesses and faulty wiring of Carmy’s brain.

The Bear season 3 hits you in the gut like a fever dream cleverly constructed from a montage of trauma.
Rated: B+

The show's signature blend of chaotic kitchen drama and introspective character arcs remains as compelling as ever.

El Pais (Spain)
What Christopher Storer and his sister Courtney continue to do with The Bear —whose third season has just landed and is consumed at breakneck speed because it only gets better: the rise is meteoric and unstoppable— is history. [Full review in Spanish]

I cooked for 30 years and am now retired. That being said, I cannot watch one second of this show, I don't care what season it is. The show is unrealistic, horrible and gives the culinary world a bad name. Stay away.

I was waiting for bear grillis to show up and he never did. Sad that they call this the bear when he is the one and only bear. Bare with me

In season three the show lost its focus and began introducing too many personal details. What grabbed me in the first two seasons was the interplay of the characters in the context of the restaurant.

I tried to get through this season but gave up episode 4 and started checking the reviews. Really messed that up. Constant music was annoying. I have a radio.
