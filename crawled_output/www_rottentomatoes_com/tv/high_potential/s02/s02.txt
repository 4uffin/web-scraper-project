High Potential isn’t overly concerned with realism. Made by ABC in the US, this is slick, narcotic network TV. It’s crowd-pleasing and easy on the eye.
Rated: 3/5

While we still enjoy High Potential, we hope that the continuing Game Maker storyline doesn’t disrupt the show’s flow as much as it does in the first episode of Season 2.

High Potential is a solid procedural with a great central character. ... It could run for many seasons to come. But if just a little more attention were paid to the supporting characters, it would make watching all of those seasons much more enjoyable.
Rated: 6.8/10

The Game Maker storyline and ludicrous s2 opener is ruining a good show. Suspending belief is required watching any tv detective show but the the first episode pushed that way too far.

I absolutely loved the first season, but s2e1 was so dumb I couldn’t finish the episode. Maybe the writers don’t know what to do now that they’re not copying the original French version when it comes to the Ramon story.

I had no idea David Giuntoli was on this show until I saw Bitsie Tulloch’s instagram yesterday. Watched it last night it’s really fun!!! I hope David is in every episode? It doesn’t look like he was last season. I was a huge fan of Grimm and then I watched A Million Little Things. Anyway it’s a fun premise for a show and it was fun to find a new show

This show is back stronger than ever and I really enjoyed the premiere of this seasons episode. I got chills, tears, thrills, and everything you can think of. I genuinely think this is one of the better hits on broadcast tv that we have had in a while and I’m so thankful that ABC is giving this show a chance!
