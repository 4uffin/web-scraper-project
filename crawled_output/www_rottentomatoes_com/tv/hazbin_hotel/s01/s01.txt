Hazbin Hotel follows Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitating demons to peacefully reduce overpopulation in her kingdom. After a yearly extermination imposed by angels, she opens a hotel in the hopes that patrons will be "checking out" into Heaven. While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie, and their first test subject, adult-film star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the "Radio Demon" reaches out to assist Charlie in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality.

A hellzapoppin' musical series swathed in hot, vibrant colors, Hazbin Hotel is worth a booking.

While Hazbin Hotel makes a valiant attempt to pack a lot into its 25-minute episodes, it ultimately delivers too few laughs to be worthwhile.

Perhaps Hazbin Hotel will overcome its growing pains to strike a chord that feels unique, instead of a reaction to the cavalcade of hyperactive heroines who have come before. At present, Medrano's expansion of her online works is flashy but thin.

The show so far is a blast with a large cast of dynamic and interesting characters.

Ironically, after viewing the whole series, only one phrase comes to mind..."Jesus Christ."

I don’t know what he’s going to do next, and that’s why I’m so desperate to see more of him. It’s why I’m so desperate for season two. Hazbin Hotel has crafted the perfect villain in Alastor – one who is so blatantly amoral, yet somehow still likeable.
