The question is: Will anyone outside the industry care? I’m biased, but I think so. That’s because the creators have figured out a way to mix their satire with a snappy, broadly appealing energy centered around physical comedy and antic setpieces.

Seattle Times
Rogen and Goldberg here create satire of a very high level... And despite all the mocking and in-jokes and references to titles you may or may not remember, there’s something else that peeks through: a genuine love for movies.

Feels like the culmination of everything Rogen has endured in a career ranging from writing for The Simpsons to co-directing a movie that sparked threats of war from the North Korean government.

These are episodes that cover the whole spectrum of Hollywood madness amusingly and hilariously (and even with some laugh-out-loud moments). (...) One of the best comedies of the year and an absolute feast for film lovers. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4.5/5

If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to be in charge of a chaotic group project where no one really likes you but no one can fire you either, The Studio, Apple TV’s new comedy, is your new comfort show.
Rated: A-

The Jacobin
[Rogen and Goldberg] seem to have no Matt Remick–like delusions of grandeur or love of film art for art’s sake. In fact, it’s not hard to imagine them following up their successful series The Studio with a film spin-off called The Kool-Aid Movie.

It sucks. Unlike everyone else, I don't feel it is 'on the nose' but off the mark. It's a silly take on Hollywood without wit or intelligence. It is unfunny and uninspired and poorly written. The characters are two-dimensional, and the acting is terrible. I worked for a studio for years. It's nothing like that, and nobody would behave in that manner or talk to studio executives like that.

I know this is supposed to be the sharp new show of the moment, but although there are some funny lines, I don’t see why almost every conversation is laced with the f-word. I’m not a prude, but the word’s overuse is distracting. Do not plan to watch Episode 2…or any others.

Very mid. Has its moments of high paced shenanigans, but after an episode or 2 it quickly becomes clear that it's a shtick that is used throughout the entire season. From the constant drum sounds to the characters talking over each other for comedic effect, It quickly got tiring for me.

Tedious shouty show entirely dependant on knowing who the actors are and what they played in other shows. I’m not sure why anyone thinks a poor joke will work better if said at full volume with added expletives.
Even walk on cameos by famous people can’t rescue this ploddingly boring waste of time and money. I never knew before that the Emmies were a contraction of emetic,, but I do now!
