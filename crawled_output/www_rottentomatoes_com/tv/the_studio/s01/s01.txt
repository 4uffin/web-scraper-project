The question is: Will anyone outside the industry care? I’m biased, but I think so. That’s because the creators have figured out a way to mix their satire with a snappy, broadly appealing energy centered around physical comedy and antic setpieces.

Seattle Times
Rogen and Goldberg here create satire of a very high level... And despite all the mocking and in-jokes and references to titles you may or may not remember, there’s something else that peeks through: a genuine love for movies.

Feels like the culmination of everything Rogen has endured in a career ranging from writing for The Simpsons to co-directing a movie that sparked threats of war from the North Korean government.

These are episodes that cover the whole spectrum of Hollywood madness amusingly and hilariously (and even with some laugh-out-loud moments). (...) One of the best comedies of the year and an absolute feast for film lovers. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4.5/5

If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to be in charge of a chaotic group project where no one really likes you but no one can fire you either, The Studio, Apple TV’s new comedy, is your new comfort show.
Rated: A-

The Jacobin
[Rogen and Goldberg] seem to have no Matt Remick–like delusions of grandeur or love of film art for art’s sake. In fact, it’s not hard to imagine them following up their successful series The Studio with a film spin-off called The Kool-Aid Movie.

Occasionally sharp and funny, but often infantile and boring. This is not the best satire about film studio woes although it touches on some very topical issues. Ultimately it is a big disappointment.

I don't get it. I didn't find it funny at all. Maybe it got funnier after the first episode? I didn't get past the first episode.

The humor is so cringe. I think these are talented people but it just leaves me distracted by this. Maybe just not my type of comedy.

Seth Rogen doing a series about Hollywood and its studios. Ok!. Yes, like that! Exactly like that! No synopsis or analysis needed. Just Seth Rogan -> Hollywood.
