The question is: Will anyone outside the industry care? I’m biased, but I think so. That’s because the creators have figured out a way to mix their satire with a snappy, broadly appealing energy centered around physical comedy and antic setpieces.

Seattle Times
Rogen and Goldberg here create satire of a very high level... And despite all the mocking and in-jokes and references to titles you may or may not remember, there’s something else that peeks through: a genuine love for movies.

NPR
Feels like the culmination of everything Rogen has endured in a career ranging from writing for The Simpsons to co-directing a movie that sparked threats of war from the North Korean government.

World Socialist Web Site
The series’...first season is “edgy” and “knowing” enough to be termed iconoclastic, but sufficiently conventional and soft, in the end, not to offend the corporate hierarchy or the Trump administration. ... It is something of a lowest common denominator.
Rated: 2/4

These are episodes that cover the whole spectrum of Hollywood madness amusingly and hilariously (and even with some laugh-out-loud moments). (...) One of the best comedies of the year and an absolute feast for film lovers. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4.5/5

If you’ve ever wondered what it feels like to be in charge of a chaotic group project where no one really likes you but no one can fire you either, The Studio, Apple TV’s new comedy, is your new comfort show.

Given the fact it’s the first thing I put on when I sit down every evening, and the fact that it’s frustratingly addictive given Matt’s plight and constant string of bad luck, I’m giving this a MUST WATCH.
Cameo cast is Deep, Zoe kravitz and Bryan Cranston is a bonus, and Kevin McCallisters mom is hilarious.
Great series

I was skeptical about The Studio at first, mainly because it was on Apple TV, but I’m so glad I gave it a shot. It’s easily one of the funniest shows I’ve seen in years. Seth Rogen and the entire cast absolutely nailed it. Genuinely hilarious and really well written. Honestly, it might be the best thing on Apple TV and one of the best comedies on TV. The best way to describe it: Hollywood meets anxiety meets comedy. I highly recommend it and it deserves all the Emmys it won.

A very entertaining season, though after the terrific early episodes the later episodes were less interesting.

Occasionally sharp and funny, but often infantile and boring. This is not the best satire about film studio woes although it touches on some very topical issues. Ultimately it is a big disappointment.

I don't get it. I didn't find it funny at all. Maybe it got funnier after the first episode? I didn't get past the first episode.
