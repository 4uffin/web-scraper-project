The Nightly (AU)
When Netflix talks about making shows that are “gourmet cheeseburgers”, The Diplomat is it. It's a lesson in how to make TV that is incredibly binge-y, entertaining, and doesn’t make you feel like an idiot for liking it.

Janney is this series’ saving grace, because until her arrival things are too gloomy.
Rated: 3/5

Season 2 doesn’t just match the intensity of its debut—it raises the stakes across the board.
Rated: 5/5

Male-skewing numbers aside, The Diplomat reveals an empowering script where women drive most of the series’ events.
Rated: B-

Austin Burke/Flick Fan Nation
Season two elevates the stakes, becomes faster-paced, and ultimately has more explosiveness than the first. It may occasionally feel overwhelming, but the results are impressive. Russell crushes once again.
Rated: 8/10

Snappy dialog but ultimately a contrived soap opera with very little credibility in any plot line. if you're looking for realism this isn't it. It's light soap opera entertainment with performers doing their best with the subpar writing.

Contrived, formulaic, and unoriginal. It’s getting harder by the day to watch American made series. They’re all trying to teach us some sort of lesson. No thanks. A waste of Keri Russell’s time.

Really like this show. High quality with great acting, but yet still easy to watch and soapy.

4.0 stars; If you like a fast-paced political thriller with a good dose of twists and turns, this is your series. It is two seasons long (so far), and I hoped for a third. But if there were a third season, I guess it couldn't be called "The Diplomat." (No spoiler alert here.) Just kidding. I understand a third season is coming. As far as the plot and acting are concerned, the bar remained high from season one and was met.
