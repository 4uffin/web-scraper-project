The Age (Australia)
This limited series gets to some crazy places after a warm-up of dinner-table sniping and sexual control, but the implausibility doesn’t lessen the enjoyment.
Rated: 3.5/5

Girlfriend is hardly high art, but it is an outright gas.

The Times (UK)
And while there’s a smattering of class commentary and occasional attempts at deeper meaning, this is a drama that should be enjoyed for what is: a rollercoaster of fun and games.
Rated: 4/5

Watching these two clash is great fun, the very definition of binge-worthy drama.

...The Girlfriend
doesn't invent anything new, nor does it aim to be relevant in its themes; it's simply entertaining, and that's all it is. [Full review in Spanish]

What begins as a finely calibrated struggle between justifiable concerns and asserting control, as told from two different perspectives, regrettably loses psychological roots and plausibilty with the frantic escalation, becomes a campfest. The climax is sadly conventional, the coda even more so. Still the story’s construction holds up to a degree, and the acting performances from the two antagonists alone are very much worth your time.

I am really lost why the good ratings on this one. It is actually surprisingly ridiculous, especially how the things are escalating at the end. If you have already seen a crime or any movie, you will know the events of this one as getting closer to its finish.
Shocking to see that stories like this can get a green light for production and how women writers cannot write but only dumb, one-dimensional male characters. I assume its a revenge because of the past, but then again, it has nothing to do with a special original story.
Only good thing is Robin Wright who I don't understand how could accept a story like this after working with biggest names of Hollywood.

A potboiler is a potboiler, but sometimes the performances are too real.
Both Wright and Cooke are SO good, they make the conflict feel again, all too real.
There is real pain here, and the actors sell it with masterful conviction.

Yet another show that is little more than sex or sexy scenes with attractive rich people. Some decent acting and a bit of suspense doesn’t distract from the fact that it’s just trashy. I’m tired of writers insulting our intelligence.

The Girlfriend is a twisty new drama series on Prime Video that’s perfect if you love stories about rich people with big secrets and even bigger problems. Robin Wright stars as Laura, a fancy art gallery owner whose perfect life starts to fall apart when her son brings home a mysterious new girlfriend. What follows is a tense and juicy battle of wills full of drama, glamour, and shocking surprises.
Based on a bestselling novel, the show is packed with beautiful locations, stylish outfits, and dramatic music that sets the mood just right. The story is told from different points of view, which makes even small moments feel exciting and keeps you guessing about who’s really telling the truth. There were times were I thought, "that was clever."
Sure, it can get a little over-the-top at times—but that’s part of the fun. The Girlfriend is a stylish, entertaining ride that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and if you’re into dramatic thrillers with a lot of flair, it’s definitely worth a watch.
