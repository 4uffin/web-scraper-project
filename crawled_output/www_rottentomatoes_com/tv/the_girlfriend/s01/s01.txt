Critics Consensus
Robin Wright and Olivia Cooke are terrific at behaving badly in The Girlfriend, a twisty thriller that strains credulity with so much aplomb that audiences won't mind.

The Age (Australia)
This limited series gets to some crazy places after a warm-up of dinner-table sniping and sexual control, but the implausibility doesn’t lessen the enjoyment.
Rated: 3.5/5

Girlfriend is hardly high art, but it is an outright gas.

The Times (UK)
And while there’s a smattering of class commentary and occasional attempts at deeper meaning, this is a drama that should be enjoyed for what is: a rollercoaster of fun and games.
Rated: 4/5

Watching these two clash is great fun, the very definition of binge-worthy drama.

...The Girlfriend
doesn't invent anything new, nor does it aim to be relevant in its themes; it's simply entertaining, and that's all it is. [Full review in Spanish]

Nice attempt at a unique take on a drama/thriller - providing the separate perspectives of two protagonists. But, unfortunately, the overall story was quite ridiculous. Almost like a glossed up version of what you'd see on daytime soap operas back in the day. And let's hope that Laurie Davidson doesn't get typecast as the "clueless idiot" in the years to come. But admittedly engaging so you can witness the sleazy hijinks - just leave any degree of critical thinking at the door.

The program offers a captivating narrative, maintaining audience engagement through compelling character development. Olivia's exceptional performance as the lead is particularly noteworthy, leaving a lasting impression. Robin's portrayal of a mother with hidden complexities, driven by an unwavering commitment to her son's safety, is also compelling. The narrative explores the dynamics of motherhood, with a focus on the lengths a mother might go to protect her child. The show's thrilling nature is enhanced by the strong performances of the female leads. The costume department outdid themselves.
