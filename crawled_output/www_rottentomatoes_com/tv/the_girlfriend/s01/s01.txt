The Age (Australia)
This limited series gets to some crazy places after a warm-up of dinner-table sniping and sexual control, but the implausibility doesn’t lessen the enjoyment.
Rated: 3.5/5

Girlfriend is hardly high art, but it is an outright gas.

The Times (UK)
And while there’s a smattering of class commentary and occasional attempts at deeper meaning, this is a drama that should be enjoyed for what is: a rollercoaster of fun and games.
Rated: 4/5

Watching these two clash is great fun, the very definition of binge-worthy drama.

...The Girlfriend
doesn't invent anything new, nor does it aim to be relevant in its themes; it's simply entertaining, and that's all it is. [Full review in Spanish]

Yet another show that is little more than sex or sexy scenes with attractive rich people. Some decent acting and a bit of suspense doesn’t distract from the fact that it’s just trashy. I’m tired of writers insulting our intelligence.

The Girlfriend is a twisty new drama series on Prime Video that’s perfect if you love stories about rich people with big secrets and even bigger problems. Robin Wright stars as Laura, a fancy art gallery owner whose perfect life starts to fall apart when her son brings home a mysterious new girlfriend. What follows is a tense and juicy battle of wills full of drama, glamour, and shocking surprises.
Based on a bestselling novel, the show is packed with beautiful locations, stylish outfits, and dramatic music that sets the mood just right. The story is told from different points of view, which makes even small moments feel exciting and keeps you guessing about who’s really telling the truth. There were times were I thought, "that was clever."
Sure, it can get a little over-the-top at times—but that’s part of the fun. The Girlfriend is a stylish, entertaining ride that doesn’t take itself too seriously, and if you’re into dramatic thrillers with a lot of flair, it’s definitely worth a watch.

SPOILERS
Very high-quality TV series overall — great acting, pacing, and writing. But I knew the director was going to find a way in the end to justify even her pathological, obsessive mania in a very cheap reveal. Very disappointing.
I feared they were going to make Cherry out to be the real “bad” one in the war over Daniel by telling us she is actually a “psycho” (as the stupid song at the end told us) who will off anyone who doesn’t give her what she wants. Very little leading up to that suggested this — to me she seemed genuinely in love with Daniel and more the victim than the one who needed to be feared.
Didn’t the mother say the father had done that wrong? Was she just lying? And how foolish of the mother to tell Laura everything if she truly intended to do whatever it took to protect her daughter.
Also — if Cherry really did those things to exes, why did the first one in the series simply get a bloody surprise on his wedding day? That was extreme but perhaps warranted given what he said. Yes, she did punch him — but that’s the only violence we saw from her besides the self-inflicted wound, which I admittedly didn’t like.
Ultimately, very well done, but it could have been exceptional had it not gone for the twist ending that undercut so much of what had preceded it — and ended with what was, from the start, the most predictable outcome, in my opinion.

One thing I really love is the way this show portrays the same situation through different characters’ perspectives.
