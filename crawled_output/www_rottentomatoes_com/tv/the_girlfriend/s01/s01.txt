Critics Consensus
Robin Wright and Olivia Cooke are terrific at behaving badly in The Girlfriend, a twisty thriller that strains credulity with so much aplomb that audiences won't mind.

Craig Mathieson
The Age (Australia)
This limited series gets to some crazy places after a warm-up of dinner-table sniping and sexual control, but the implausibility doesn’t lessen the enjoyment.
Rated: 3.5/5

Girlfriend is hardly high art, but it is an outright gas.

Tim Glanfield
The Times (UK)
And while there’s a smattering of class commentary and occasional attempts at deeper meaning, this is a drama that should be enjoyed for what is: a rollercoaster of fun and games.
Rated: 4/5

Bangkok Post
For all its talk of manipulation, paranoia and family loyalty, it rarely digs deeper than surface-level theatrics.

Common Sense Media
Watching these two clash is great fun, the very definition of binge-worthy drama.
Rated: 4/5

...The Girlfriend
doesn't invent anything new, nor does it aim to be relevant in its themes; it's simply entertaining, and that's all it is. [Full review in Spanish]

A terrible writer in all aspects of novel writing, even for schlock of this variety. Worthless characters, abismal plots, insulting endings. I might have wasted my time on the 6-part TV series, but at least I didn't spend more time on any of her books. She should never have been allowed to learn how to read as a child, much less been given a pencil.

This was a 5-star show right up until Episode 5.
I felt really let down in how they handled the reveal for Cherry.
I wanted an explosion and it just felt very anticlimactic.
Very disappointing.

There is so much wrong with this but still a good watch,most annoying is Daniel who would bow down to both women he is like a wet wk end,he is suppose to be a Dr yet didn't try resuscitation on his mother in the pool,Laura friend was sickly and over acted the part and her daughter couldn't act!! Cherry mum was good as was cherry acting skills,
