An all-star cast head to a resort and unleash their worst, most privileged impulses. The series is a sharp social satire following the exploits of various guests and employees of the fictional White Lotus resort chain, whose stay becomes affected by their various dysfunctions. A week in the life of vacationers is unravelled as they relax and rejuvenate in paradise. With each passing day, a darker complexity emerges in these picture-perfect travelers, the hotel's cheerful employees, and the idyllic locale itself.

Critics Consensus
Darker and more patient with its storytelling than previous seasons while brandishing a superb new ensemble full of acidic performances, The White Lotus' third season offers a spiritual respite that shivs the soul.

TIME Magazine
I still can’t think of another show that so thrillingly builds tension and explodes pieties purely through piercing dialogue exchanged by ideally cast actors.

Mike White is a strong enough writer that even when there’s less cohesion it’s still going to be enjoyable to watch.

Viewers can continue to tell themselves they are getting something out of watching privileged characters in paradise having a less than perfect time, but it’s increasingly difficult to say that it is anything close to good.

KGET-TV (Bakersfield, CA)
Mike White continues to show how pain and suffering can thrive even in the most lavish settings. It is that contrast that makes the series so strong.

Digital Mafia Talkies
The White Lotus is a masterclass in interconnected storylines. The brilliance lies in how smoothly the story unfolds. Every shot is calculated, and the juxtaposition of shots to deliver a message is rare on television these days.

Christopher Stevens
Daily Mail (UK)
It’s beautifully photographed, like a travel brochure for billionaires, but writer and director Mike White knows what we expect of him, and he delivers.
Rated: 5/5

Absolutely disgusting the amount of vile and demonic crap in this show! From incest to depraved explicit
sexual deviance enough to make me puke!
Hollyweird is completely evil and I hope they all fall! I only have HBO as a free trial and seeing the line up of more crap like this I would never pay to have depravity in my home! And all you people who liked this show you should check your morals cause you are on a fast track down!

Like any ongoing series, the weight of expectations can translate to disappointment.
This third season seemed tightly directed and well performed, but the script’s potholes stood out more in season 3 than they would in 2 or 1.
Still a good watch…just not very good to me.
