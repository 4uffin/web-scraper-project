The show can border on the cornball; the characters are the sort you might have seen in the sort of dramas popular in 1868. But the actors inhabit their roles with commitment, so that even the bad company is good company.

San Jose Mercury News
True to Knight’s style, it boasts tremendous production values, and is energetic, racy and above all else irresistible.
Rated: 3.5/4

Knight knows how to pace a show, and House of Guinness is immensely watchable from scene to scene, most of which are launched from one to the other by means of a bit of contemporary rock music.

Comparisons to Peaky Blinders are inevitable, but House of Guinness is a self-contained, captivating drama on its own merit.
Rated: 4/5

Irish Independent
House of Guinness should be judged as an entertainment, and its problem is that it isn’t very entertaining. It’s predictable and it’s boring and there will very probably be a second series.

Lacy Baugher
Paste Magazine
Though the back half of the season struggles with some pacing problems and several ill-advised time jumps, House of Guinness is so confident in its own identity that the show mostly makes it work.
Rated: 8.5/10

Really good particularly like the brother and sister relationship and thought acting and story telling was absolutely brilliant. A must see hope they make sequel.

The biggest problem I have with the series is how many non-Irish actors with absolutely atrocious, fake Irish accents have been cast.
The story has potential.
The dialogue is painful to my ears.

They fell short. Kind of disappointed. They promoted it like Peaky Blinders but it's no way like it. It's more like prince charming and its family story. There's no thrill, no suspense, no action, just mostly fictional story using real life characters.

Its most amusing to watch how the Irish were so enthusiastic about free Ireland with any means possible. But nowadays they want to give it away to any idiot who invades on a boat. Were are the freedom fighters of Ireland now?

I really wanted to like it as I’m a HUGE Peaky Blinders fan but it unfortunately didn’t deliver. Some of the dialogue such as: “It may be I who will be the cornerstone of the House of Guinness.” suggests that they almost don’t trust their audience to pick up on subtext? A show where everything is handed to the audience, combined with the very slow pacing, makes for a pretty boring watch which is a shame bc the visuals were EXCELLENT (other than the fact that they had the Republicans dressed in Green, again it doesn’t have to be THAT on the nose). The music choice was also SO bizarre? I understand Kneecap is rising in popularity but it’s very strange to play songs featuring “tiocfaidh ár lá” behind a show that’s centred around a Protestant family.
TLDR: the acting and visuals were all pretty good but the writing and music choice is where it fell short imo.
