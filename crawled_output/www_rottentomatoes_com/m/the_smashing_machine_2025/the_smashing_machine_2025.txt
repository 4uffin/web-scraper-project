What to Know
Critics Consensus
Dwayne Johnson goes the distance with his transformative turn as Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a gritty biopic that sidesteps cliché even at the expense of narrative satisfaction while still landing the dramatic body blows that count.

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
On the one hand, casting a brand-name pro wrestler as a well-known mixed martial artist is completely on the (prosthetic) nose. What’s remarkable about his work in The Smashing Machine, though, is how little of the Rock comes out.

CBC Radio
Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Peter Howell
Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

CGMagazine
Dwayne Johnson impressively captures Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, but it’s a fantastic performance surrounded by a merely okay sports movie.
Rated: 6.5/10

Doug Jamieson
The Jam Report
A film that promises unflinching honesty but too often retreats to safer dramatic beats, landing as an ambitious yet frustrating entry in the sports biopic genre.
Rated: 2.5/5

Derrick Murray
NERDBOT
[The] final product feels more self indulgent than self reflective, and approaches the material at arms length and a sort of meandering disinterest in his subject...leaving the film to be a rather pedestrian sports biopic dressed up as an auteur’s vision.
Rated: 3/5
