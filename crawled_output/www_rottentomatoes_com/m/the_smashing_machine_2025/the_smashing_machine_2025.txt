What to Know
Critics Consensus
Dwayne Johnson goes the distance with his transformative turn as Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a gritty biopic that sidesteps cliché even at the expense of narrative satisfaction while still landing the dramatic body blows that count.

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
On the one hand, casting a brand-name pro wrestler as a well-known mixed martial artist is completely on the (prosthetic) nose. What’s remarkable about his work in The Smashing Machine, though, is how little of the Rock comes out.

CBC Radio
Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Peter Howell
Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

Jana Monji
Age of the Geek
If you can stomach realistic depictions of people getting their faces smashed, this is an emotionally raw look at a brief period of MMA Michael Kerr's life features great performances by Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.
Rated: 4/5

Brent Hankins
The Lamplight Review
If Johnson continues down this path and gets away from the recycled performances he's been delivering for years, The Smashing Machine could mark the beginning of a genuinely compelling second act for one of Hollywood's most reliable stars.
Rated: 8/10

Travis Johnson
Blunt Magazine
The Smashing Machine is not much of a movie. It’s not even much of a marketing campaign for Johnson’s acting abilities, which seems to be the point of the exercise.
