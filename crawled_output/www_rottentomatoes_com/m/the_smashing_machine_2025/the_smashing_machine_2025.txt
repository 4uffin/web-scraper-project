What to Know
Critics Consensus
Dwayne Johnson goes the distance with his transformative turn as Mark Kerr in The Smashing Machine, a gritty biopic that sidesteps cliché even at the expense of narrative satisfaction while still landing the dramatic body blows that count.

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
On the one hand, casting a brand-name pro wrestler as a well-known mixed martial artist is completely on the (prosthetic) nose. What’s remarkable about his work in The Smashing Machine, though, is how little of the Rock comes out.

Emily Blunt is the heavyweight performer delivering an electric charge to a somewhat dramatically flat answer to Raging Bull.

Toronto Star
Supporting performances from real UFC legends and a Kerr cameo add to the palpable naturalism of this sweat fest, which aims for the heart rather than the head.

For Your Reference Podcast
From Young Rock and now The Smashing Machine, Johnson’s desire to dig deep is met with a reluctance to be vulnerable. Paired with signature head-inducing Safdie storytelling, we never quite feel like we are being told the whole story, just the glory.
Rated: 3/5

For Your Reference Podcast
An emotional, Oscar-bound journey with incredible turns from Johnson and Blunt. Yet by softening the rage behind Kerr, it risks feeling too polished, raising questions about how much truth we’re really shown.
Rated: 3.5/5

David L
"The Smashing Machine" is a sensitive, texturally rich, and technically strong character study, but the melodrama gets in the way knowing who this guy is beyond his struggles. The documentary of Mark Kerr—the real one—was somehow more potent when we saw it unfiltered.
Benny Safdie, co-creator of Uncut Gems and Good Time, dives headfirst into the bruising world of early mixed martial arts with The Smashing Machine, a biographical drama chronicling the turbulent life of MMA pioneer Mark Kerr. Starring Dwayne Johnson in his most vulnerable dramatic role to date, the film captures a three-year stretch where triumph inside the cage collided with heartbreak and self-destruction outside of it.
The story follows Kerr at the height of his career, when his dominance in Pride Fighting Championships made him a legend of the nascent sport. Nicknamed “The Smashing Machine” for his brute strength and wrestling pedigree, Kerr was celebrated for his explosive takedowns and violent precision. But behind the adoration was a man unraveling. Battling painkiller addiction, struggling with depression, and locked in a volatile marriage with Dawn Staples (Emily Blunt), Kerr’s victories in the ring stood in stark contrast to the chaos of his private life.
Johnson sheds his larger-than-life Hollywood persona to embody Kerr, capturing both his physical prowess and emotional fragility. His hulking presence sells the fighter’s dominance, but his haunted eyes reveal the broken man beneath the surface. It’s a performance of restraint, rooted less in showy transformation and more in the quiet devastation of a man who can conquer opponents but not his demons. Blunt is compelling in the underwritten role of Dawn, who ricochets between loyalty and despair as Kerr’s world caves in. Their scenes together crackle with tension, but the script too often reduces her to a familiar “worried spouse” archetype rather than granting her a fully realized arc.
Benny Safdie brings his signature intensity to the fight sequences, shooting them with handheld urgency and an almost documentary-like rawness. Each punch lands with a visceral thud, the camera lingering on swollen faces, bloodied mats, and the stunned silence of near knockouts. These moments pulse with the chaotic energy Safdie perfected in Uncut Gems. Yet when the film steps outside the cage, it plays more like a conventional sports biopic, hitting expected beats without digging as deeply as its subject deserves.
Where the movie succeeds is in revealing Kerr’s contradictions, a man celebrated for his indestructibility yet crumbling under the weight of painkillers and personal despair; a champion adored by fans but alienated from himself. The tragedy is palpable: Kerr isn’t undone by a single opponent, but by the relentless demands of his own body and the pressures of a sport built on spectacle.
Still, "The Smashing Machine" doesn’t fully escape formula. Safdie captures the atmosphere of early MMA, the unregulated chaos, the carnival-like fight nights, the sense of a sport still defining itself, but the film stops short of becoming the raw, searing character study it could have been. Johnson is committed and convincing, but the script keeps him boxed into familiar beats of breakdown, relapse, and redemption without pushing into the full complexity of Kerr’s psyche. However I do have to say, I've never seen a better performance from someone trying to act like they're not on opioids. The scenes where he's trying to act like nothing's going on and he's just sitting and staring trying to hide his addiction, that's probably the most authentic version of that that I've ever seen so good for him.
For some, this will be remembered as the film where Dwayne Johnson finally “got serious,” trading sarcastic quips and explosions for bruises and tears. And while his performance is admirable, the movie around him doesn’t always rise to his level. "The Smashing Machine" is an engaging, often thrilling, but rarely transcendent biography, a story that mirrors Kerr’s own struggle: powerful, tragic, but it's ultimately unfinished.
