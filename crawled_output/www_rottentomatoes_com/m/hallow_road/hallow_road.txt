Hallow Road
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Minimalist in presentation while getting great mileage out of Rosamund Pike and Matthew Rhys' superb performances, Hallow Road is a nerve-wracking thriller that takes audiences down a haunting path.

Mashable
Hallow Road is a sensationally scary thriller not only for the surprises it packs but also for the metaphor it makes about parenting.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
Babak Anvari is back in top form with Hallow Road.

Tim Robey
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Much is left to the imagination here– Anvari may be aiming for the slippery logic of a Grimm’s fable. At the same time, his overeager screenplay spells out too much. What should be the sore aftermath to a familial bust-up has the telltale ring of a recap.
Rated: 2/5

Filipe Freitas
Always Good Movies
The ambiguous finale leaves your mind spinning more than your gut churning, as hope flickers desperately within the shadows of the woods.
Rated: 3/5

Patrick Cremona
Radio Times
Anvari's stylish direction ensures that despite the contained setting, the film avoids feeling too stagey, and both leads excel as their panic gradually devolves to despair.
Rated: 4/5
