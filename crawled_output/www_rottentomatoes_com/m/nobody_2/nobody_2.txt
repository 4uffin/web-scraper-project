Nobody 2
What to Know
Critics Consensus
While frumpy action-hero Hutch Mansell tries to enjoy a nice vacation, Bob Odenkirk works overtime to make Nobody 2 a diverting sequel that measures up admirably to the original.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
With wildly inventive carnage and audacious fight choreography, Nobody 2 invites you to vacation vicariously through Hutch Mansell.

My only issue with Nobody 2 is that it is perfectly content to replay what worked best in 2021’s Nobody and not put much thought into doing anything ambitiously different.
Rated: 3/4

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
There is an interesting kind of Straw Dogs & Home Alone DIY thing about what happens... I always enjoy that sort of stuff.

Globe and Mail
As the medley of violence continues, Stone’s mugging goes from giddily sinister to hammy and exhausting. Same goes for Nobody 2, and also the post-John Wick wave of action movies it’s part of.

A classic case of diminishing returns.

Lyles' Movie Files
The kind of action movie that delivers exactly everything it promises. It’s an intense action experience with an occasional winking nod to the camera that indicates everyone involved is in on the gag — and the fun.
Rated: 8/10

David Griffiths
Subculture Entertainment
Take the premise of National Lampoon’s Family Vacation and mix it with raw, comedic action of The Fall Guy and you basically sum up what Nobody 2 is really about. Nielsen might be wasted here but at least it looks like Odenkirk and Lloyd had fun.
Rated: 2.5/5
