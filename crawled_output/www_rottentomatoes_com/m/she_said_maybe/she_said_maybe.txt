If you’re hungry for a solid foreign-language film or rom-com title, then the sweet and satisfying German-Turkish delight that is She Said Maybe should satisfy your craving.

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
She Said Maybe is a mess of a rom-com with leads you can’t root for and a cast of malicious characters you have to tolerate for little payoff.
Rated: 2.5/10

Inane. I love international which is why I plowed through it. Sponsored by the Turkish Tourism people, I am sure.

Foreign films often bring refreshing perspectives and storytelling approaches, but sometimes the way they’re packaged for international audiences can hinder the experience. She Said Maybe, a 2025 foreign comedy, unfortunately falls into that trap. While the film clearly has heart, its heavy-handed dubbing severely undercuts the experience, making it difficult to engage with the story the way it was intended.
The biggest issue here isn’t the direction. In fact, the director deserves credit for crafting a comedy with charm and cultural nuance. But the dubbing is jarring—mouth movements and dialogue rarely align, and the overemphasized delivery strips away the authenticity. It leaves the audience constantly distracted, unable to fully invest in the characters or humor. Watching it in its native language with subtitles would almost certainly have elevated the viewing experience.
Beyond the dubbing, the screenplay itself feels uneven. Certain plotlines are stretched thin with unnecessary buildup, while others are rushed without proper development. This imbalance creates a sense of tonal whiplash, leaving the film struggling to maintain a consistent rhythm. The potential is there, but the execution falters under these missteps.
That said, there are moments where the charm shines through. You can glimpse what the film could have been if handled differently—funny, quirky, and perhaps even touching. Unfortunately, those moments are buried under awkward pacing and the distracting barrier of poor localization.
Ultimately, She Said Maybe is an example of how much presentation matters when bringing a film across borders. Comedy thrives on timing, tone, and authenticity—and when those elements are lost in translation, the heart of the film gets lost too. While it might find some appreciation in its native market, as presented here, it struggles to resonate with broader audiences.
