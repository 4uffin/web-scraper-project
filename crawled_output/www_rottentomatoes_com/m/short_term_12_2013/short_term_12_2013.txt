Independent (UK)
Brie Larson is very impressive as the caring, funny supervisor whose own demons threaten to engulf her.

Ben Sachs
Chicago Reader
Set in a foster-care facility outside of San Francisco, this independent drama is vivid and heartfelt in its depiction of social work, at times recalling some of Frederick Wiseman's great documentary portraits.

Liam Lacey
Globe and Mail
The film's climax feels a little rushed and overwrought, but the movie's real resonance is its exploration of empathy and vocation.
Rated: 3/4

Keith & the Movies
A movie that doesn’t lose itself in the typical Hollywood contrivances and forced melodrama...
Rated: 4/5

I just finished watching this film. Best 96 minutes I've spend in a LONG time! It was heartening and heartwarming at the same time. And that octopus story will stick with me forever. Brie Larson is such a great, young talent. She has just become my favorite heroine of the year.

This movie gives people a truthful perspective of kids who’ve experienced abuse and/or neglect. Worth seeing!!
I could have easily been Jaden, or Grace. I am a follower of Jesus, and it’s only because of His mercy and grace in my life since I was 14 that I was not like them. I went through emotional, verbal and sexual abuse by father figures. I’m so thankful for Jesus, for loving mentors, and godly counselors who helped me to heal!!!
