Four years ago, 13-year-old Finn killed his abductor and escaped, becoming the sole survivor of The Grabber. But true evil transcends death... and the phone is ringing again. Four-time Academy Award® nominee Ethan Hawke returns to the most sinister role of his career as The Grabber seeks vengeance on Finn (Mason Thames) from beyond the grave by menacing Finn's younger sister, Gwen (Madeleine McGraw). As Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, the headstrong 15-year-old Gwen begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake. Determined to solve the mystery and end the torment for both her and her brother, Gwen persuades Finn to visit the camp during a winter storm. There, she uncovers a shattering intersection between The Grabber and her own family's history. Together, she and Finn must confront a killer who has grown more powerful in death and more significant to them than either could imagine.

Meagan Navarro
Bloody Disgusting
A strong vision and unique interpretation of horror classics, combined with a tremendous cast, ensure Black Phone 2 surpasses its predecessor in just about every way.
Rated: 3.5/5

Rocco T. Thompson
Slant Magazine
Throughout, Scott Derrickson collapses dreams, reality, past, and present sidelong into a singular cinematic haunted space.
Rated: 2.5/4

It’s a tick too long and has a section that’s far too expository for a film that’s at its best when it leans into surreal nightmare logic, but this weird movie works its fear factor in unexpected, creative ways.
Rated: 3/4

Mary Beth McAndrews
Dread Central
While a few of the big swings connect, ‘Black Phone 2’ falls short of a home run due to overwrought dialogue and a newfound focus on the power of faith.
Rated: 2.5/5

Pop Heist
Black Phone 2 is why we go to the movies in October. It's the kind of horror made for raucous opening nights with lots of popcorn and a crowd ready to scream, so see it that way if you can.

Where The Black Phone was a story of survival, Black Phone 2 is one of reclaiming and growing into your own power.
