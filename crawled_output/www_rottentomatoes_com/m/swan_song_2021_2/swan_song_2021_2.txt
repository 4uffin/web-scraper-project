As Cameron grapples with whether or not to alter his family's fate, he learns more about life and love than he ever imagined.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Swan Song occasionally strays on the wrong side of maudlin, but Mahershala Ali's work in dual roles lends this sci-fi drama genuine heart.

Newsday
Mahershala Ali crafts two clearly defined characters, allowing for the movie to ask its familiar questions about how we define our humanity in a new way.

It raises some really intriguing ethical quandaries.

Austin Chronicle
Cameron's journey is a complicated and poignant one, though the muted aura that maintains a rigid hush over scenes keeps the viewer at something of an emotional detachment.

A stoic, moving film about working through anticipatory grief and coming to the realization that some things are bigger than ourselves.

Mark Leeper's Reviews
Cameron (Mahershala Ali) is dying, and to save his family from grief, he agrees to being cloned with all his memories except the ones that would tell him he is a duplicate. The plot has similar ideas to FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED, and also MOON.
Rated: 6/10

Zoë Rose Bryant
Loud and Clear Reviews
Swan Song is sci-fi at its most stripped down and stirring, with the masterful Mahershala Ali (in his first lead role!) rooting the drama in grounded emotional realism.
Rated: 3.5/5

This movie was quite beautiful and thought-provoking ... Mr. Ali was stellar as always, with Ms. Harris and Ms. Close as amazing supporting characters. It was a little slow and meandering at times, but the character development was solid and the "what-if" factor will have me pondering the decision I would have made for a long time to come. Lovely, emotional movie.

I can’t believe an SF movie could be this sad! In the end, the only one who truly understands me is myself.

Um belíssimo drama romântico de ficção científica, com roteiro inteligente e execução perfeita, fotografia linda, seja dos ambientes naturais quanto os futuristas, flertou com outros filmes que tinham um toada parecida, entretanto sobressai pelo ar intimista decide envergar, aprofundando se no difícil dilema entre ética, confiança, altruísmo e até mesmo questionamentos morais da clonagem e Mahershala Ali está excelente...
O filme é lirico, nos emociona, encanta e entretém…

Daniel G
Long version of what easily could have been an amazing "Dark Mirror" episode. However, after a strong start, it become too sweetly emotional and slowed down a bit too much, just when it was time to climax. Nevertheless, kudos to another powerful performance by Mahershala Ali. Of course, it does beg some ethical and metaphysical issues - in particular, could one say that the same person will actually die twice, but each time will suffer the insecurity and pain of dying? Also, the death of the 1st personality in an isolated, though stunning natural location, is exactly that which makes the departure the hardest, without loved ones around.
