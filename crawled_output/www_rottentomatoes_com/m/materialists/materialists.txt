Materialists
What to Know
Critics Consensus
A mature deconstruction of the conventional rom-com, Materialists provides its trio of swoon-worthy stars some of their meatiest material yet while reaffirming Celine Song as a modern master of relationship dramas.

Audience Says
Materialists takes it time unfolding a modern love story that’s more drama than the comedy it promises, yet a stellar cast keeps it relatable and engaging.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
A really smart, well-written, well-played, slightly bittersweet rom com.

Clarisse Loughrey
Independent (UK)
It’s a film that works beautifully as an intellectual exercise. Ironically, it’s in the love stuff where it starts to falter.
Rated: 3/5

Laura Venning
Little White Lies
Materialists, shot on gorgeous 35mm, does manage to capture something of the sheer inexplicable miracle of romance in a world that wants us to view each other as disposable.
Rated: 3/5

Its march to finding love should feel enthusiastic, but “Materialists” feels listless.

El Heraldo
While Materialists may not delve as deeply into emotion as Past Lives, the film still manages to capture, with wit and sharpness, the tensions of love in the age of digital dating. [Full review in Spanish]

Film Ireland Magazine
While Materialists doesn't necessarily reinvent the rom-com, it certainly pays fresh dividends to the genre. This style of film is often written off reductively, and yet Song has created a truly modern love story.

Watching Materialists felt like sitting through a script that could’ve been written by a teenager who just discovered the concept of “money isn’t everything.” The entire premise boils down to one thinly stretched theme: choosing between wealth, status, and shiny distractions versus a modest, grounded life. That’s it. Nothing more.
There’s no nuance, no exploration of why characters might be seduced by superficiality, and no deeper commentary on what “meaningful” living really means. The dialogue circles endlessly around the same point, hammering home its message with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
Materialists mistakes simplicity for profundity, leaving the audience with nothing to chew on except the reminder that meaningful stories require more than a one-line moral.

Slow plotline. The lingering kisses used up too much of the plot. Some funny charichatures. As a 60 year old, very little of this storyline was to me at all innovative or new.
