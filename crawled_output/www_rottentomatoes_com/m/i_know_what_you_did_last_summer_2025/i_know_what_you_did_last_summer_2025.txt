When five friends inadvertently cause a deadly car accident, they cover up their involvement and make a pact to keep it a secret rather than face the consequences. A year later, their past comes back to haunt them and they're forced to confront a horrifying truth: someone knows what they did last summer... and is hell-bent on revenge. As one by one the friends are stalked by a killer, they discover this has happened before, and they turn to two survivors of the legendary Southport Massacre of 1997 for help.

I Know What You Did Last Summer
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Faithfully harkening back to the original for better or worse, this I Know What You Did Last Summer reboot serves up plenty of nostalgia without finding a compelling hook of its own.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
I Know What You Did Last Summer revives the campy slasher spirit of the original, and while it leans heavy on nostalgia, its new cast is lively – until they get the hook.

In the end, some won’t care what they did last summer. Autumn, winter or spring.
Rated: 2/4

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
The film’s flaws would be forgivable if it were clever, but apart from a few random one-liners, it isn’t.

Matt Glasby
Empire Magazine
“Nostalgia’s overrated,” warns this vacuous slasher with a wink. Trouble is, other than obnoxious new characters meeting immemorable ends, that’s all it has to offer.
Rated: 2/5

Ian Bunting
Daily Record (UK)
Sadly, the lazy script is a letdown and even when it takes chances, there isn’t enough meat on the storyline bones.

Jeffrey Lyles
Lyles' Movie Files
A pale comparison to the original thanks to its uninspired story that seems more intent on frustrating franchise fans with some divisive decisions instead of providing a good scream.
Rated: 2/10

I Know What You Did Last Summer is a mediocre but properly paced little mystery with something more creative lurking under the surface.
