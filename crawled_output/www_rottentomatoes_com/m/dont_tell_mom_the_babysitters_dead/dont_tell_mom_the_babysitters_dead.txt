Critics Consensus
It has an amusing enough premise, but Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead will just leave viewers pining for the madcap hijinks promised by the title.

Gilded by personable performances, particularly from [Christina Applegate and Josh Charles], this wish-fulfilling fantasy manages to be wholeheartedly ridiculous in a manner that leaves criticism disarmed.

Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead starts with an enjoyable, if crude, black comedy situation promised by the title, but then it turns into an incredibly dumb teenage girl's fantasy of making it in the business world.

This is a sassy little comedy of wit and intelligence from the director of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

It's not bad, but hardly what you put down money in a cinema to see.

Reel Film Reviews
...an appealingly larger-than-life premise that is, for the most part, employed to affable effect by Herek...
Rated: 2.5/4

Christina Applegate is so cool, she owns every second sheâ€™s on the screen in this smart, sarcastic dark comedy 90â€™s cable gem.

Decently funny movie but some pretty bad acting. Kinda cringy at times but it's my guilty pleasure as I had a crush on Christina Applegate back in the day

This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid mostly because I was a fan of Christina Applegate and I always wondered what it would be like to drive a car and have a job before turning 18. It was fun to watch and something that I could relate to.
