What to Know
Critics Consensus
Made on a shoestring budget, El Mariachi's story is not new. However, the movie has so much energy that it's thoroughly enjoyable.

Peter Stack
San Francisco Chronicle
By turns hilarious, soulful, gritty and sexy, this lively crime drama was created by 23-year-old director Robert Rodriguez of Austin, Texas, for a budget of 7,000.
Rated: 4/4

Harper Barnes
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
El Mariachi makes the bloated movies of Steven Seagal and other American martial arts stars look as lazy and cluttered as the tag-team match at a tanktown wrestling arena. This movie means business.

Boston Globe
Although crude, it deftly balances kinetic action sequences with hip awareness, only occasionally succumbing to moves that seem self-conscious or affected.

This $7,000 film is one that shows what passion and talent can do and how to bring a story to the screen properly with the right folks involved.

Some of the film is monotonous, but it‚Äôs so completely what it is ‚Äî a shoot-‚Äôem-up done with throwaway energy ‚Äî that you‚Äôd have to be fun-impaired not to enjoy it.
Rated: B+

Filme mais ou menos, o roteiro √© fraco, a hist√≥ria do filme ficou meio fraca, as cenas s√£o bacaninhas, mas o elenco quase n√£o ajudou em nada no filme.

I think I've seen every one of Rodriguez's films, even spy kids and still nothing compares to his freshman project imo. Maybe because it was made on a shoestring budget he had to be super creative and precise with his every choice... and it clearly shows. But to me it's a great film not despite the budget, but regardless of the budget...at any price, it's a work of art as far as cinematography and immensely entertaining, funny, sexy and especially impressive to me, it was violent with a purpose not just for the sake of it and not gratuitous. I thought T2 was the best action movie of the year it was made (1991) and honestly this comes close, and may be more charming imo.
It's Just oozing with personality and charm and better than all the big budget Hollywood movies by the director to come that seem to replace the charm with production value.

I‚Äôve been meaning to watch this film for a long time, but when it left Pluto I ran out of options. Well it came back for this month only, and I knew I had to give it my time. Now that I‚Äôve sat down and truly watched it I just got to say that was so much better than expected. It‚Äôs like a Leone Spaghetti Western, and a Blaxsploitation movie had an awesome baby. The unbelievably low budget allows for the creativity and passion to just ooze out of every corner of the film. This film proves how great of a director Robert Rodriguez really is, and was definitely worth the watch. Unfortunately I‚Äôm deducting a star because of my own fault, I don‚Äôt know Spanish and you can‚Äôt expect a dub to do a movie much justice. 4/5 stars, great film and was definitely worth every second of my time.

A charming and energetic classic with a great view of the city where it was made and great action, made even more impressive by the film's mere 7,000 dollar budget.
