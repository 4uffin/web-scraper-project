Nostalgia For The Light is a gorgeously contemplative masterpiece by a supreme filmmaker who's questions leave us with a sense of wonder and our own new mysteries to ponder.

It was on the SnS22 list.
It started out interesting learning about astrology in Chile, but then it completely switched stories to the dictatorship and those searching for dead family like the astrologers.
It was manipulative and felt so contrived.

There is a lot to like about this Patricio Guzmán documentary - sharp visuals, a sincere tragedy to document, and an interesting premise (the parallels between those that search the past for cosmic truth and those that do so for personal closure). Nostalgia for the Light captures the tragedy of the Chilean identity of recent decades well (or at least it seems so looking from the outside in), as wounds remain raw while many wish to sweep yesterday's injustices under the rug. To those that resonate with the experiences of the film's subjects, it seems to strike a particularly powerful and melanchlolic chord.
But as soon as a documentary begins to talk about the vast unknown of the universe with nothing beyond how we should marvel at how vast and unknown it is, I immediately check out. You can plug and play sentiments like that into any serious documentary, and they can be made to mean anything; it feels like listening to your college buddies getting high in your living room and spouting off whatever seems 'impactful'. And sadly, Guzmán opened the film with that. Those sections are nicely shot, but I realized it wasn't to my tastes from then on; still, very tastefully done with respect to the 'disappeared' dissidents, their families, and those left to pick up the pieces. Comes together later in the runtime. (2.5/5)

Intermingling of stories, science, life, human nature, sadness and truth. How fragile the fabric of human culture is and the realization of how easy it is for it to break down.

Patricio Guzmán has woven a beautiful documentary from the personal quests of Chilean people seeking to locate the remains of their loved ones in the desert where dictator Augusto Pincoche banished them. These themes work perfectly against the backdrop of man's quest for the stars and the high visibility of the night sky from this perspective.
