Darcy (Dev Patel) and Daphne (Rosy McEwen) Davenport are freshly decamped from London and taking up residence in an isolated cottage deep in the Welsh countryside in search of creative renewal and acoustic inspiration. When the couple set about exploring their new environs, recording instruments in tow, Darcy stumbles upon a "faerie circle" that emits a strange, unidentifiable frequency; this odd discovery is followed closely by the appearance of an otherworldly child (Jade Croot) who claims to live nearby and is eager to befriend the Davenports. Soon the child becomes a fixture in their household, alternately ingratiating himself and raising suspicions, and exposing unacknowledged rifts and unexamined secrets that threaten to wreak psychological and spiritual havoc in the lives of his makeshift adoptive parents.

There’s so little substance underlying the suspense that when you finally get your “aha” answers, you’re left wondering why you came into the woods in the first place.

Slant Magazine
It’s when the film plays in the gaps between sound and image that it’s most disturbing.
Rated: 3/4

Coasts on its interpretability alone.

Rabbit Trap leans hard into avant-garde storytelling that pays off if the viewer is willing to immerse themselves in Chainey's twisted fairytale.
Rated: 7.5/10

An immersive sensory experience with just enough atmosphere to gloss over the significant gaps in its storytelling.

Why does hokeywood think Dev Patel can act? Better in bollywood? Or couldn't he make it there? Why the interracial coupling? Confounding
