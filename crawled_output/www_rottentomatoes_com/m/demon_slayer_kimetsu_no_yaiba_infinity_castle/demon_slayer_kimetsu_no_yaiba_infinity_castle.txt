Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

For the casual fan, the chief reason to seek out “Infinity Castle” is for its visuals, which position passionately emotive characters over impressionistic backdrops.

The movie was amazing, but the description for selecting tuckets said that there would be closed captions and did not mention the language the movie would be in. I bought tickets expecting to watch the Japanese language version with english subtitles. Instead I got the English dub verion. The voice acting and english translations of certain scenes realy stopped my immersion.

I loved it the animation was good and had W references like 6…7 then we had peak fights and W backstories for me the only thing is it had very little humor except from the beginning and some characters didn’t get like any screen time.
