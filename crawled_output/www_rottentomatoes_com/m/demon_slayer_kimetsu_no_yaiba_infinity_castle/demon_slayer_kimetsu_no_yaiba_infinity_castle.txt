Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

For the casual fan, the chief reason to seek out “Infinity Castle” is for its visuals, which position passionately emotive characters over impressionistic backdrops.

You still believe in the Davids among the impossible battle against immortal, regenerating, bloodsucking Goliaths.

Even for the uninitiated this is well worth a trip to the movie theater to see and marvel at on a big screen.

The end result is like stepping on and off a moving train, and though most of it will fly over the heads of casual viewers, there’s a definite poetry to its many mysteries.

Demon Slayer Infinity Castle might not be very accessible to those unfamiliar with the popular series but its stunning animation, great voice acting, and layered storytelling makes this one of the best animated films of the year.
Rated: 4/5

Infinity Castle is not a quick and easy entry point into the Demon Slayer saga, but it still provides one of the most epic entries of the animated adaptation of Gotouge’s iconic manga.
Rated: 9/10

jesse v
look, this looks fantastic with the studios showing off their animation chops. But this movie should have just been half the time every character's actions AND their positions in the story are explained by countless back stories of their past. The third act especially only focuses on one character to the point that we forget we're still in the castle. The music only really hype up the battles, which pause too soon for more backstory.

They spent more time on the flashbacks than the giving us fighting scenes. Looks like we will be waiting for another movie to give us more flashbacks.
