Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

For the casual fan, the chief reason to seek out “Infinity Castle” is for its visuals, which position passionately emotive characters over impressionistic backdrops.

You still believe in the Davids among the impossible battle against immortal, regenerating, bloodsucking Goliaths.

Even for the uninitiated this is well worth a trip to the movie theater to see and marvel at on a big screen.

The end result is like stepping on and off a moving train, and though most of it will fly over the heads of casual viewers, there’s a definite poetry to its many mysteries.

Demon Slayer Infinity Castle might not be very accessible to those unfamiliar with the popular series but its stunning animation, great voice acting, and layered storytelling makes this one of the best animated films of the year.
Rated: 4/5

Infinity Castle is not a quick and easy entry point into the Demon Slayer saga, but it still provides one of the most epic entries of the animated adaptation of Gotouge’s iconic manga.
Rated: 9/10

This movie was soooo good!!! I usually don’t like the Demon Slayer movies because they don’t feel like movies. But boy does this one feel like a movie. I’m going to see it again. It was action packed, there was drama and sadness. An all around good movie. 10s across the board!!!!!

The movie was an hour too long. With 75% of the movie being flashbacks, they definitely could have trimmed down the fat and made it less boring.

Absolutely stunning visuals along with a great soundtrack! This was the first anime film I experienced in IMAX, and it was worth every penny! I just wish there were more showtimes dedicated to the subbed version, as that is the version of the show most people watch (only 1 per day at my theater compared to 2 per day for the English dub). If you were hesitant to go see the movie in theaters, you absolutely should rather than wait for it to come to streaming!
