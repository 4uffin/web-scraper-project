Tanjiro Kamado -- a boy who joined an organization dedicated to hunting down demons called the Demon Slayer Corps after his younger sister Nezuko was turned into a demon. While growing stronger and deepening his friendships and bonds with fellow corps members, Tanjiro has battled many demons with his comrades -- Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Along the way, his journey has led him to fight alongside the Demon Slayer Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, the Hashira, including Flame Hashira Kyojuro Rengoku aboard the Mugen Train, Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui within the Entertainment District, as well as Mist Hashira Muichiro Tokito and Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji at the Swordsmith Village. As the Demon Slayer Corps members and Hashira engaged in a group strength training program, the Hashira Training, in preparation for the forthcoming battle against the demons, Muzan Kibutsuji appears at the Ubuyashiki Mansion. With the head of the Demon Corps in danger, Tanjiro and the Hashira rush to the headquarters but are plunged into a deep descent to a mysterious space by the hands of Muzan Kibutsuji. The destination of where Tanjiro and Demon Slayer Corps have fallen is the demons' stronghold -- the Infinity Castle. And so, the battleground is set as the final battle between the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons ignites.

For the casual fan, the chief reason to seek out “Infinity Castle” is for its visuals, which position passionately emotive characters over impressionistic backdrops.

You still believe in the Davids among the impossible battle against immortal, regenerating, bloodsucking Goliaths.

Demon Slayer Infinity Castle might not be very accessible to those unfamiliar with the popular series but its stunning animation, great voice acting, and layered storytelling makes this one of the best animated films of the year.
Rated: 4/5

Infinity Castle is not a quick and easy entry point into the Demon Slayer saga, but it still provides one of the most epic entries of the animated adaptation of Gotouge’s iconic manga.
Rated: 9/10

The Cosmic Circus
This approach to exposition—on the fly, with flashbacks acting as “gap fillers” whenever necessary—feels refreshing and actively turns this relatively complicated story into one of pure mythmaking.
Rated: 5/5

This movie was phenomenal it had everything you could think of for an anime movie. It had spectacular characters as well as story telling mixing perfectly with the action sequence. There was emotional rollercoaster as well between the fight scenes and actions scenes you could really feel everything behind every character, my only critique is that the story telling ran a little long on some parts and was lacking the grasp of attention towards the audience but overall I give this movie a 9/10

Upon seeing it twice and as a manga reader I could not be more happy with how the anime adaptation turned out. I knew the flashbacks that were coming, and they didnt bother me, nor did they bother me in the manga. They really elevate every character and make you realize how far theyve come. If youre reading this review and are an anime-only, these next two movies should blow this one out of the water with whats to come.

First off, the movie itself is absolutely phenomenal. It was so good, I had to watch it a second time, first in standard (dub), second in IMAX (sub). The visuals and sound design are truly top-notch, as is the voice acting, both in sub and dub. I've seen many others state that the backstories felt like they interrupted the action too much, but I'm at One Piece fan, so... They were perfectly fine for me. Now, as far as the theaters themselves, I'm a little frustrated with both experiences. The standard definition viewing at a Regal had way too much sound coming from the center dialogue speaker, so the music and sfx were much quieter than they should have been. However, the AMC IMAX theatre was better balanced, but from my seat, the harsher high frequencies overall were quite painful at times. I've always believed that sound can make or break the experience, and both issues pulled me out of the moment a little too much. All and all, I can't wait for the film to reach streaming platforms and DVD release so I can watch and listen with my studio gear!
