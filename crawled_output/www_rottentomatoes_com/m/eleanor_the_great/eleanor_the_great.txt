Eleanor the Great
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut may have the pitfalls of an unsteady visionary, but this ultimately uneven caper is greatly amplified by June Squibb's exquisite performance.

Rolling Stone
Squibb knows exactly how to use spoonfuls of sugar to help the regret, the side-eye snark, and the heartache go down. The film’s just good enough. She’s great.

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
The result is a drama that tries to be a comedy, and a comedy that doesn’t know that it is in fact a drama, with the resulting story uneasily resting somewhere along the border separating the profound from the perfunctory.

Associated Press
Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out “Eleanor the Great.” The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.
Rated: 2.5/4

Denerstein Unleashed
The actors do their best to convey the required sensitivity, and the movie's small moments are well-played. Still, contrivances and a strained conclusion didn't convince me that the subject matter...had been given enough weight.

Deep Focus Review
Squibb has only recently graduated from minor supporting parts to lead roles, and she’s a pleasure to watch. Johansson’s admiration for her star is palpable, even if the first-time director doesn’t give the titular character much of an identity of her own
Rated: 2.5/4

made me feel a weird kind of nostalgia for a place I didn't grow up and a culture I'm not a part of, which I consider extremely impressive.
