What to Know
Critics Consensus
Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut may have the pitfalls of an unsteady visionary, but this ultimately uneven caper is greatly amplified by June Squibb's exquisite performance.

There’s enough in “Eleanor the Great” to still make it watchable, especially the genuinely moving intergenerational connection between two women who need each other to move past their particular grief.

Tim Grierson
AV Club
Grief can make people do unimaginable things—too bad Johansson’s debut lacks the imagination or courage to delve into the darkness in order to bring her audience (and Eleanor) back into the light.

[Squibb's] performance is her own story, and it’s enthralling and heartwarming.
Rated: 3/5

Scarlett Johansson makes an impressive directorial debut with a tender indie comedy/drama.

Movies and Shakers
Johansson’s first time directing is a promising start deserving more opportunities. At 94, June Squibb is a fountain of boundless energy as the caustic, sarcastic, tender loving Jewish Mother. Together they have created a big cinematic hug.

Third Coast Review
The film's biggest flaw is the massive suspension of disbelief we're asked to make as Eleanor and Nina become more and more enmeshed in the film's central lie
Rated: 2/4
