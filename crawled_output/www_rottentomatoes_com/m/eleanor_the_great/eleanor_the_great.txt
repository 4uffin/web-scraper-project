Eleanor the Great
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut may have the pitfalls of an unsteady visionary, but this ultimately uneven caper is greatly amplified by June Squibb's exquisite performance.

Nell Minow
Movie Mom
Sqiibb, Kellyman, Johansson, and first-time screenwriter Tory Kamen have made a film about loss, friendship, and compassion. Eleanor may not always be great, but this movie lets us see the parts of her that really are.
Rated: B+

New York Times
There’s enough in “Eleanor the Great” to still make it watchable, especially the genuinely moving intergenerational connection between two women who need each other to move past their particular grief.

Tim Grierson
AV Club
Grief can make people do unimaginable things—too bad Johansson’s debut lacks the imagination or courage to delve into the darkness in order to bring her audience (and Eleanor) back into the light.
Rated: C-

KKFI-FM (Kansas City)
Squibb and young Erin Kellyman are excellent in “Eleanor the Great,” a sweet-natured comic drama about the results of questionable choices.
Rated: 3/5

It’s dubbed “Eleanor the Great,” but the only thing exceptional about it is its charismatic star, the incomparable June Squibb.

Eleanor the Great is one of the finest and devastating films of fine cinematic art that I have viewed in many years!
It wrenches your gut and gives you the reason for living and how we all deal with grief and loss in our lives.
It is superbly acted, led by Eleanor, June Squibb and the performances by the roles of Nina and Bessie.
This is a must see film not only about the lives of those who are meshed into their faith, but by all mankind as everyone has to, at some point in our mortal existence, deal with the loss of someone to the supernal world.
Sometimes, characters such as Eleanor,
we may delve int o the inner psychological world whereupon we take on their loved ones life's tragedies and experiences simply because that person is no longer here to share this, or did not share it, with others.
In other words it is a NEVER FORGET those who have suffered and those we leave behind to deal with the void.
Scarlett Johansson's directing was smooth, perfection, and truly a work of art!

This is an amazing film that is brilliantly directed and performed.
The dynamic between Squibb and Kellyman is lovingly developed through interactions and experiences that let's audiences become immersed in the gentle, funny, and consequential relationship.
The actors here are lucky to have Johansson at the helm and she gives them a wide aperture to showcase their talents backed by incredible shot selection, audio quality, and even the gentle pauses in dialogue that let the essence of the lines, jokes, or facial expressions resonate in way often lacking in most films that usually seem rushed to move the scene along.
In an era of blockbuster CGI-dominated box offices, this gentle heartfelt film is a unique and worthwhile cinema experience.
Highly recommended.
