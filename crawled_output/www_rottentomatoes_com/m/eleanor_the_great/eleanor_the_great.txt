What to Know
Critics Consensus
Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut may have the pitfalls of an unsteady visionary, but this ultimately uneven caper is greatly amplified by June Squibb's exquisite performance.

June Squibb is brilliant in Scarlett Johansson's feature directorial debut.

Slant Magazine
Scarlett Johansson’s direction keeps things simple and intimate in a way that Tory Kamen’s overambitious screenplay doesn’t.
Rated: 2.5/4

The film never quite recovers from the moral issue at its center, Squibb’s lively performance makes it memorable.
Rated: 2.5/4

Eleanor, the Great’s captivating acting, perfect-pitch score (Dustin O’Halloran), and custom-tailored photography (Hélène Louvart), wins a case that has been on appeal for two thousand years and counting.

The AU Review
A bittersweet, moving experience that should speak to a multitude of generations on how we forgive both ourselves and those around us.
Rated: 4/5

Murjani Rawls
Substream Magazine
It would be easier to say Eleanor was a fighter pilot or some great philosopher. However, asking the cast to bridge the gaps in how loss resonates through generations, particularly in the context of death and catastrophic events, proves to be too much.
