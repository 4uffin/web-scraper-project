In the 1920s, actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a bona fide matinee idol with many adoring fans. While working on his latest film, George finds himself falling in love with an ingenue named Peppy Miller (B√©r√©nice Bejo) and, what's more, it seems Peppy feels the same way. But George is reluctant to cheat on his wife with the beautiful young actress. The growing popularity of sound in movies further separates the potential lovers, as George's career begins to fade while Peppy's star rises.

Critics Consensus
A crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of silent cinema, The Artist is a clever, joyous film with delightful performances and visual style to spare.

Irish Times
The fiction, ultimately, is the thing. The Artist, in the best possible sense, is more of a movie than a film. It's played for laughs and tears; it switches from action to tenderness; it's got a really funny dog.

The Artist is simply a pleasure to watch, if only for just two hours in time.

Michel Hazanavicius' black-and-white, mostly silent comedy The Artist is a gorgeously made curiosity -- a film that functions as a testament to its own obsession with other movies.

Next Best Picture
It isn‚Äôt easy to get modern audiences to engage with a film that looks like it was made a century prior. Yet, that‚Äôs precisely what director Michel Hazanavicius manages to do.
Rated: 7/10

Awards Daily
The Artist, as cute and charming as it was when it came out, falls into the severely niche category a decade later.

Deep Focus Review
It‚Äôs the opposite of everything that sells at the box office today, and it‚Äôs a pure delight from start to finish.

The Artist est un magnifique hommage √† l‚Äôhistoire du cin√©ma. Le film r√©ussit √† recr√©er l‚Äôunivers du muet avec √©l√©gance et sensibilit√©, tout en rendant hommage √† une √©poque r√©volue. Il permet √† la nouvelle g√©n√©ration de comprendre, √† travers une fiction touchante, ce que signifiait le passage du muet au cin√©ma parlant.
Jean Dujardin livre une performance exceptionnelle : par ses expressions faciales et sa gestuelle, il transmet des √©motions puissantes sans dire un mot. C‚Äôest ce qui rend son interpr√©tation si juste et marquante. La musique et les effets sonores viennent sublimer le tout et nous plongent compl√®tement dans cette ambiance r√©tro.
La fin, pleine d‚Äô√©motions, est une r√©ussite totale ‚Äî intense, lib√©ratrice et parfaitement dos√©e. C‚Äôest un film hors du commun, √† la fois original dans sa forme et universel dans son propos.
Bon, cela dit‚Ä¶ on comprend aussi pourquoi la parole a fini par s‚Äôimposer au cin√©ma.
