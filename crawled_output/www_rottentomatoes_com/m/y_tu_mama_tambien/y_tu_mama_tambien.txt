Critics Consensus
Led by a triumvirate of terrific performances, Alfonso Cuarón's free-spirited road trip through Mexico is a sexy and wistful hymn to the fleetingness of youth.

New York Daily News
Although the pace is buoyantly charming, Cuarón -- and his screenwriter brother, Carlos Cuarón -- never let the viewer forget that life and death go on outside the car windows.
Rated: 3.5/4

St. Louis Post-Dispatch
[Gael García Bernal] is especially vivid... We suspect that soon he will be offered roles in American films. But this scintillating film makes a compelling argument that there's a paradise waiting for those who keep traveling south.
Rated: 3.5/4

Arizona Republic
Criticizing this movie for having too much sex is to miss the point. People will either accept the scenes or not, but Y tu mamá también suffers from a far worse affliction: There's not a single likeable character in the movie.
Rated: 2/4

Loud and Clear Reviews
By telling the story of two horny and privileged teens and their older female companion, [Cuarón] ends up saying a lot about sex, power, corruption, social issues and even the gender spectrum, years before the latter concept became more well-known.
Rated: 5/5

The Queer Gaze (Podcast)
A scintillating road trip movie about much more than sex. Cuaron's shooting style is intimate and immediate; the political commentary is baked in for viewers who know where to look. The performances are raw and vulnerable. A classic of queer cinema.
Rated: 4.5/5

I have seen Cuarón’s other films, but never the one that put his name on the map. The acting is fantastic on all fronts. It was also interesting to see how political moments were added. The explicit content was a bit unnecessary in my opinion but the story is otherwise great.

"¿No quisierais a veces vivir para siempre?"
This simple question stuck with me without realizing the immense impact it would have by the film's end.
I was already familiar with Alfonso Cuarón's talent, but with this movie, it's why he was chosen. It's amazing how this story explore themes like friendship, sexuality, and interpersonal relationships with such authenticity. On top of that, every moment is filled with a beautiful cultural richness.
A beautiful story that, despite its explicit content, shines through with its profoundly human message.

Movie is packaged as an adolescent teenage comedy but transforms into something better.
Patience is mandatory for the first hour with rewarding satisfaction at the finish line.

Esmeralda V
Película que a pesar de todo lo erótico y sensual, te enseña la vida tal y como es: repleta de verdades disfrazadas de mentiras y vergüenzas.
Hay gente que comenta que Luisa hizo que los dos amigos dejaran de serlo, yo no comparto esa opinión.
Luisa ayudó a que el brillante amor que ellos dos se tenían reluciera. Sin siquiera ellos saberlo, los sentimientos salieron. Los tres escondían verdades que nadie supo pero que cambiaron sus vidas para siempre.
Y como no mencionar el maravilloso trabajo de Luna, García y Verdú: inolvidable. Alfonso Cuarón demuestra una vez más el amor que le tiene a México, tierra mágica; ya que no solo nos muestra la trama entre los tres personajes sino que nos adentra un poco en la maravillosa cultura de México, descubriendo paisajes deslumbrantes y sobretodo realistas, dada la situación política. Las escenas son ideales: nostálgicas y naturales (realistas).
Para mí, el final lo es todo. Siempre será lo mejor de una buena película.

Johann D. M
🇲🇽 Esta comedia dramática de carretera de Alfonso Cuarón narra la historia de dos adolescentes y una atractiva mujer mayor que se embarcan en un viaje por carretera a través de México para aprender cosas sobre la vida, la amistad, el sexo y de ellos mismos.
Pero la película va mucho más allá de este entrañable trío, brillantemente interpretado por Maribel Verdú, Gael Garcia Bernal y Diego Luna. Su historia se yuxtapone con gran acierto al contexto político y económico de México a finales del siglo XX. Cuarón demuestra un dominio excepcional al retratar las percepciones sociales de su país de forma auténtica e inquietante como telón de fondo, mientras el triángulo amoroso se va desenvolviendo hasta confrontar a los personajes con sus verdades más crudas. El final, inesperado y melancólico, nos recuerda que la vida dista mucho de ser un cuento de hadas, y que los seres humanos somos, ante todo, profundamente complejos.

A gleefully raunchy, hedonistic adventure through Mexico that carries a stringent sociopolitical undercurrent, Y tu mamá también has fantastic performances, sly camerawork, and an affecting story to tie it all together.
