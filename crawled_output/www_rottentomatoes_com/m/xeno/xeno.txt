Romey Norton
Film Focus Online
At its core, Xeno isn’t about aliens; it’s about empathy. It’s a family-friendly story (rated PG-13), but it doesn’t shy away from darker undertones. It’s something everyone can enjoy and is instantly memorable.
Rated: 3.5

Epoch Times
It’s a straight-up hybrid of “Starman,” “The Iron Giant,” and “E.T.” If you view it through an “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” lens, the movie more than makes up for its lack of new ideas with a lot of grit, pluck, and a huge heart.
Rated: 5/5

Despite the similarities, “Xeno” (2025) is no “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982) and is a solid entertaining movie with enough bite to make the stakes feel high.

High on Films
What keeps it from being yet another copy is its willingness to dabble in cold, hard cynicism. That isn’t a drawback by any means, [as it is a world where] sweet innocence coexists with the unchecked cruelty of those who fear what they don’t understand.
Rated: 4/5

We need more creators like Matthew Loren Oates, and more movies like Xeno, to help those in-betweeners feel acknowledged, and important enough that people still want to make films just for them.
Rated: 8/10

Cinemalogue
While it admirably brings a darker fantasy perspective, the film lacks the emotional depth for a third-act payoff that doesn’t resonate as intended.

Think if E.T. was a little more horrifying.
And the government was not so nice. This was like that .It held up pretty well, especially with yhe end credit scene.

Lulu Wilson was fantastic in this movie; the whole cast was solid. A really good mix of sci-fi and personal conflict without either being too much. Really well done.

Just an enjoyable movie start to finish.
Lulu Wilson was great…look for her in the future.
Very good timing for this movie considering the times in which we are living.

Great movie, we need more indie films that tip a hat to the classics in the genre (ET, alien) but bring new twists and insights. Well done

Unoriginal and uninteresting. This felt like a filmmaking exercise completed without joy or inspiration. It lacks moments of wonder, comedy, fear or happiness. Just overwhelmingly bland all the way through. If you are going to tell your version of E.T., you had better bring some new ideas to it, and, no, making the boy a teenage girl isn’t enough. This could have been so much better. Let the Right One in crossed with E.T.? That is a movie I would love to see, but instead of taking the best parts of those movies, you took the worst and made something derivative in the worst way. Nothing was surprising. Nothing fun. Everything fell flat because it relied on cliche characters, flavorless writing and a rushed, unsatisfying conclusion. We were the only two people in our movie theater at a 7pm Friday night show, and now I know why.
