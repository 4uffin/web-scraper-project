At its core, Xeno isn‚Äôt about aliens; it‚Äôs about empathy. It‚Äôs a family-friendly story (rated PG-13), but it doesn‚Äôt shy away from darker undertones. It‚Äôs something everyone can enjoy and is instantly memorable.
Rated: 3.5

It‚Äôs a straight-up hybrid of ‚ÄúStarman,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Iron Giant,‚Äù and ‚ÄúE.T.‚Äù If you view it through an ‚Äúimitation is the sincerest form of flattery‚Äù lens, the movie more than makes up for its lack of new ideas with a lot of grit, pluck, and a huge heart.
Rated: 5/5

Despite the similarities, ‚ÄúXeno‚Äù (2025) is no ‚ÄúE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial‚Äù (1982) and is a solid entertaining movie with enough bite to make the stakes feel high.

High on Films
What keeps it from being yet another copy is its willingness to dabble in cold, hard cynicism. That isn‚Äôt a drawback by any means, [as it is a world where] sweet innocence coexists with the unchecked cruelty of those who fear what they don‚Äôt understand.
Rated: 4/5

This movie is confused about what tone and audience it wants to have. It's trying to be both an edgier E.T. and a sci-fi horror movie. SO many cliched characters, and even the few "likeable" ones are impossible to care about
because nothing they do makes sense. I was actually
surprised at how turned off I was by Xeno because the trailer made it look pretty cool.

so imagine ET but with a xenomorph. But like, there is no real government urgency other than a crew of 10 people, one of which is obsessed with a toy car and talks in riddles. Don't get me wrong, the main character is EXCELLENT at her role, but time moves so slowly that she neglects her pets, parents, and even school towards the end. You can tell the movie was contractually obligated to focus on only 6 characters that can talk. I wish the xenomorph did at the end honestly.

Think if E.T. was a little more horrifying.
And the government was not so nice. This was like that .It held up pretty well, especially with yhe end credit scene.

üíî Coming out of the theater I'm very impressed at how heartbreaking Xeno was for me! I really truly enjoyed the emotional journey the movie took us on, with a heartfelt performance which really made me emotionally invested in the film and just wanting things to get better for our main character!

I wasn't super impressed with this one, although I wouldn't call it bad. It seems like they wanted to make a drama about a teenager with a bad family situation, but they put an alien in it just to sell tickets. I had the same issue with "Black Bag;" it felt like a drama with an unrelated film tossed in, although I definitely preferred "Black Bag" over this. It takes so long to set up her family situation, we don't get that much stuff with the alien. The alien's design is awesome, however, and they do a good job showing the girl bond with it. The teenage girl is annoying, helping someone cheat and violating the property of someone who hasn't yet wronged her. Of course she has to be an orphan; it serves little purpose and drags out the talking scenes in a movie that already has too many. Both of the villains are too melodramatic for a movie that's trying to be serious. The first goes from flawed to criminally violent out of nowhere; the second has motivations that are never explored. The teenage boy is more interesting, having to make a hard decision. I also liked the mom, although she admits she's wrong about things we don't have evidence of her doing. I admire the ending more than I like it. I think we don't get enough sad endings in films. However, this leaves too many unanswered questions: what are these things? Why are they being sent to earth? Are some of them dangerous? Is the goverment guy right in his theory? How on earth does everyone not know about this if there are plenty of other aliens? Will the earth be invaded? It stops abruptly and we don't get to see how they deal with this. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" - which is underrated- had a similar ending, but it showed Spidey's response, so there was more resolution. I wouldn't call this film good or bad, just mediocre.
