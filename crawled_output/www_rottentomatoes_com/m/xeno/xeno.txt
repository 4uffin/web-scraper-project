At its core, Xeno isn’t about aliens; it’s about empathy. It’s a family-friendly story (rated PG-13), but it doesn’t shy away from darker undertones. It’s something everyone can enjoy and is instantly memorable.
Rated: 3.5

Epoch Times
It’s a straight-up hybrid of “Starman,” “The Iron Giant,” and “E.T.” If you view it through an “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” lens, the movie more than makes up for its lack of new ideas with a lot of grit, pluck, and a huge heart.
Rated: 5/5

Despite the similarities, “Xeno” (2025) is no “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982) and is a solid entertaining movie with enough bite to make the stakes feel high.

High on Films
What keeps it from being yet another copy is its willingness to dabble in cold, hard cynicism. That isn’t a drawback by any means, [as it is a world where] sweet innocence coexists with the unchecked cruelty of those who fear what they don’t understand.
Rated: 4/5

This movie is confused about what tone and audience it wants to have. It's trying to be both an edgier E.T. and a sci-fi horror movie. SO many cliched characters, and even the few "likeable" ones are impossible to care about
because nothing they do makes sense. I was actually
surprised at how turned off I was by Xeno because the trailer made it look pretty cool.

so imagine ET but with a xenomorph. But like, there is no real government urgency other than a crew of 10 people, one of which is obsessed with a toy car and talks in riddles. Don't get me wrong, the main character is EXCELLENT at her role, but time moves so slowly that she neglects her pets, parents, and even school towards the end. You can tell the movie was contractually obligated to focus on only 6 characters that can talk. I wish the xenomorph did at the end honestly.

Think if E.T. was a little more horrifying.
And the government was not so nice. This was like that .It held up pretty well, especially with yhe end credit scene.

I totally enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was really good. The relationship between Lulu and Croak was so tender and sweet. I wish I had a Croak of my own! I hope this goes to a streaming service so I can see it again with my friends.

I really enjoyed this movie!!
An alien movie that focused more on todays cultural climate and divide.
Not gore not horror not scie fied out....dealt with a bunch of other themes like abuse/alcoholism/guilt/just being a teen/CIA overide/abuse of freedom and detention.
Well done production!
