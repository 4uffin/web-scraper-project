What to Know
Critics Consensus
Heavy on mood and light on answers, Went Up the Hill is a heady ghost story that weaves an intoxicating spell for those patient enough to surrender to its languid rhythms.

Sydney Morning Herald
By the time we got to the exciting bit, the sense of menace was rapidly dissipating and dread was beginning to lapse into self-consciousness.

‘Went Up the Hill' doesn’t just explore grief, it expresses it.

Slant Magazine
Samuel Van Grinsven’s Went Up the Hill is characterized by a starkly precise aesthetic and withholding approach to the ghost story.
Rated: 3/4

Frank Swietek
One Guy's Opinion
So slow and mannered that it doesn’t take long for the parable of trauma, loneliness, grief and desire to descend into something very near self-parody.
Rated: C

Casey's Movie Mania
Samuel Van Grinsven's moody, grief-stricken ghost story boasts mesmerising visuals but stumbles on its languid storytelling.
Rated: 2.5/5

Emily Wheeler Movie Ops
The two characters are in no hurry to get past these events, but Krieps and Montogomery's excellent performances make the plodding into an affecting dirge.

Mr. Hollywood
Concept was too easy. The rules werent really clear. But overall it was just boring and dragged.
