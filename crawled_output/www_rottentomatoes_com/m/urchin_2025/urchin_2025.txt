On the streets of London, Mike is hustling to get by. Roadside evangelizers won't let him sleep in peace, his slippery friend won't pay up the money he stole, and before long, he finds himself in trouble with the law. As he struggles to reintegrate into society, shuffling between gigs as a line cook and a trash collector, he must balance a newfound sense of community with his own itch for self-destruction.

Namrata Joshi
The New Indian Express
[Urchin] doesn’t wallow in indigence. The serious social commentary is balanced by a fine thread of humour, like a ray of sunshine in the midst of the clouds.

Tim Robey
Daily Telegraph (UK)
The scenario is so familiar it could have been the same old story, but the texture of all this street life gives it rather a special shine.
Rated: 4/5

Tomris Laffly
Elle
Harris Dickinson might be the most exciting new auteur since the Safdie Brothers. The future of British social realism looks promising thanks to his debut--knows his Ken Loach and Mike Leigh inside and out but doesn’t carbon-copy what came before.

Movies We Texted About
Astutely observed, stylishly told, and impeccably acted, it is one of the year’s best independent British films.

The Cairo Scene
...a compassionate and darkly humorous portrait of homelessness. ...Urchin asks us to care, even when it’s easier to turn away.
