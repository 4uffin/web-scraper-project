I'm No Longer Here
What to Know
Critics Consensus
I'm No Longer Here's occasionally uneven narrative is more than offset by its honest and visually poetic approach to themes of identity and assimilation.

Robert Abele
Los Angeles Times
It's a deceptively dimensional portrayal, that of someone who worries his stage is getting smaller and smaller. And in Frias' magnetic feature is enough spirit, sound and artistry to give his journey a meaningful spotlight.

Deadline Hollywood Daily
Frias has smarts and style to burn; every shot has been composed with great poise and confidence, and he cranks everything up to get the most out of every moment. He's a guy who was clearly born to make movies.

"I'm No Longer Here" may explore a culture that is entirely foreign to most of us, but its themes of community and needing a place to belong speak volumes.
Rated: 8/10

Everyone has their own version of hell, but forced immigration to an unknown country is at the top of the list. With a liberating ending, Ya No Estoy Aquí is beautifully crafted by Fernando Frías. Full review in Spanish

A breath of fresh air, raw and excellent cinematography. The performances are sublime, with long moments filmed in a single shot, a window to reality, although the plot is slow at times the interest of the story is NEVER lost and it is impossible to look away. One of the most interesting movies that came out of Mexico, and although the film took a more grim tone towards life, it is definitely a breath of fresh air.

This movie was the biggest surprise I have run into in a while. It's so different and weird, I couldn't turn away. I think it relates to every culture and explores the concept of identity and how it forms us. The world around us is constantly changing even if we try and hold on to who we are or our past. Great film.
