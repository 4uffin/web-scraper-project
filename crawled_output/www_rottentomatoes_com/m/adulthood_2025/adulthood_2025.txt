Mark Kennedy
Associated Press
Director Alex Winter and screenwriter Michael M.B. Galvin combine for a pitch-perfect black comedy that has a nifty satirical edge, inverting the movie convention of discovering that the kids are monsters.
Rated: 3/4

If you're seeking something funky, funny, and charmingly chaotic, Adulthood delivers.

Michael Rechtshaffen
The Hollywood Reporter
While Kaya Scodelario, Josh Gad and a cast of colorful characters keep it all reasonably engaging, the film... falls short of reaching its full potential.

Jim Vorel
Paste Magazine
There are enough moments of either well-calculated gallows humor or generational commentary to keep things moving briskly along, and both Gad and Scodelario find room to have a new definition of maturity thrust upon them.
Rated: 6.9/10

Shawn Van Horn
Collider
Adulthood is a film with three-dimensional people who are good for some laughs due to their reactions, but the surrounding plot is high-stakes and filled with suspense.
Rated: 7/10

Jason Gorber
Next Best Picture
Who knows how “Adulthood” will age, but if you’re looking for a brisk bout of debauchery and family shenanigans, Alex Winter’s latest chilly tale may well be something to be warmed by.
Rated: 6/10

Another Gad disaster. I don't know why hokeywood loves him. Fat and unfunny. No talent hack.
