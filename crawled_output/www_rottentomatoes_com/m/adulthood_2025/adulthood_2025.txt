Mark Kennedy
Associated Press
Director Alex Winter and screenwriter Michael M.B. Galvin combine for a pitch-perfect black comedy that has a nifty satirical edge, inverting the movie convention of discovering that the kids are monsters.
Rated: 3/4

If you're seeking something funky, funny, and charmingly chaotic, Adulthood delivers.

Michael Rechtshaffen
The Hollywood Reporter
While Kaya Scodelario, Josh Gad and a cast of colorful characters keep it all reasonably engaging, the film... falls short of reaching its full potential.

Violence and desperation allows the premise to reach its full potential, helping to carry the viewing experience most of the way as matters spin out of control. However, “Adulthood” comes up a little short when handling craziness.

To its credit, Adulthood does weave in disability storylines without sensationalizing them.
Rated: C-

Jim Vorel
Paste Magazine
There are enough moments of either well-calculated gallows humor or generational commentary to keep things moving briskly along, and both Gad and Scodelario find room to have a new definition of maturity thrust upon them.
Rated: 6.9/10

Very fun movie! I really dug the dark humor and thought that Josh Gad and Kaya Scodelario were perfectly cast. Plus Anthony Carrigan steals all the scenes that he's in. Highly recommend!

Mildly funny flick with unintended killings one after another so as not to leave loose ends by a strong-willed mother of two and a weak-minded brother to cover up a 30yo murder by their bedridden mother after a stroke.

The brother and sister are so unlikeable, I didn't care what might happen to them. The reviews before mine are all bots.
