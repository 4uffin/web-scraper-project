Mark Kennedy
Associated Press
Director Alex Winter and screenwriter Michael M.B. Galvin combine for a pitch-perfect black comedy that has a nifty satirical edge, inverting the movie convention of discovering that the kids are monsters.
Rated: 3/4

If you're seeking something funky, funny, and charmingly chaotic, Adulthood delivers.

The Hollywood Reporter
While Kaya Scodelario, Josh Gad and a cast of colorful characters keep it all reasonably engaging, the film... falls short of reaching its full potential.

To its credit, Adulthood does weave in disability storylines without sensationalizing them.
Rated: C-

Paste Magazine
There are enough moments of either well-calculated gallows humor or generational commentary to keep things moving briskly along, and both Gad and Scodelario find room to have a new definition of maturity thrust upon them.
Rated: 6.9/10

Collider
Adulthood is a film with three-dimensional people who are good for some laughs due to their reactions, but the surrounding plot is high-stakes and filled with suspense.

Growing into adulthood is never easy. You get older, your parents start needing your help. The grind of raising kids. Maybe relationships are strained. Those are some of the themes of a movie that is at turns funny, honest, insightful and ridiculous (in a great way). The actors, led by Josh Gad and Kaya Scodelario are phenomenal. Alex Winter (of Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure) does a fantastic job at the director's helm with a cracking script.
Definitely check it out!

Genius blend of noir grit with comedic bite!
Let's learn how to find laughter in our everyday anxieties instead of being crushed by them!
Well done, Alex Winter.
