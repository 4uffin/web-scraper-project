What to Know
Critics Consensus
A brainy thriller that harkens back to the gritty verisimilitude of classic conspiracy cinema, Relay might have one reversal too many but finishes the race with aplomb.

Sergio Burstein
Los Angeles Times
Ahmed, always excellent, perfectly lives up to expectations by playing a man with a very particular sensitivity... while James does her part with ease. [Full review in Spanish]

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
The action set pieces are nerve-wracking, but that screenplay snafu is too significant. Still, there’s a lot to admire in the filmmaking and in Ahmed’s performance.
Rated: 2.5/4

Robert Abele
Los Angeles Times
Some of that effectiveness is undercut by some off-putting music choices, but McKenzie's command of the material is rock solid, Giles Nuttgens' cinematography achieves a sleek, moody metallic chill and Matt Mayer's editing is always fleet.

Casey's Movie Mania
Riz Ahmed and Lily James stand out in David Mackenzie’s mostly solid paranoid thriller.
Rated: 3.5/5

Rough Draft Atlanta
Your enjoyment of the film might rest on your ability to buy in, but in most other respects, “Relay” is a perfectly enjoyable paranoid thriller, a fresh take on a genre that feels too much like a throwback these days.

That Shelf
David Mackenzie’s Relay is a throwback of sorts. Not quite the thrillers of the 1970s, like his film Hell or High Water, but closer to the renaissance the genre received in the early aughts, like Cellular and Red Eye.

The plot was interesting and I really like the main character. Sometimes the characters would do stupid things and it was really hard to watch. Also some of the side characters were really annoying. Cinematically it was great and it was entertaining to watch.
