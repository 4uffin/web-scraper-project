A brainy thriller that harkens back to the gritty verisimilitude of classic conspiracy cinema, Relay might have one reversal too many but finishes the race with aplomb.

Sergio Burstein
Los Angeles Times
Ahmed, always excellent, perfectly lives up to expectations by playing a man with a very particular sensitivity... while James does her part with ease. [Full review in Spanish]

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
The action set pieces are nerve-wracking, but that screenplay snafu is too significant. Still, thereâ€™s a lot to admire in the filmmaking and in Ahmedâ€™s performance.
Rated: 2.5/4

Robert Abele
Los Angeles Times
Some of that effectiveness is undercut by some off-putting music choices, but McKenzie's command of the material is rock solid, Giles Nuttgens' cinematography achieves a sleek, moody metallic chill and Matt Mayer's editing is always fleet.

Algo MÃ¡s Que Cine
Relay delivers a stylish, slow-burn thriller with Riz Ahmedâ€™s compelling performance, but a jarring final twist weakens an otherwise tense, meticulously crafted story of trust, deception, and corporate intrigue.
Rated: 6/10

Casey's Movie Mania
Riz Ahmed and Lily James stand out in David Mackenzieâ€™s mostly solid paranoid thriller.

The plot was interesting and I really like the main character. Sometimes the characters would do stupid things and it was really hard to watch. Also some of the side characters were really annoying. Cinematically it was great and it was entertaining to watch.
