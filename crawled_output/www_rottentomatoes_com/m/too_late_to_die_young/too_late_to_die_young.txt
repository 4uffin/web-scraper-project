Too Late to Die Young's
strengths lie in the expansiveness of both its portraiture and its mise en scène: while Hernández gives a moving, nuanced performance, Sofia's emotional turmoil is more affecting for being placed against those around her

AV Club
For better and worse (mostly better), Too Late To Die Young is a mood movie, situated on an emotional precipice.
Rated: B+

Cinefilia
Its bucolic coming-of-age portrait examines adolescence, maturity and female liberties around puerile situations and is populated, for the most part, by a cast of bland characters who lack nuance. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/10

A coming-of-age and slice-of-life drama set in Chile.
Rated: 3.5/5

The Digital Fix
Visually, Castillo's hazy, nostalgic look back at this key period in the country's recent history is akin to watching events as seen through a series of washed out Polaroid pictures.
Rated: 8/10

It's too late to stop watching, 'Too Late to Die Young' once the movie title card played in the opening moments.
What came over the next nearly two hours was mesmerizingly nothing.
Full of empty.
The best thing about this movie was the dog and he wanted to escape and for good reason.
There may have been a better movie down the road.
Make no mistake it's gorgeous and the child performances are endearing (two critics favs), but for the average cinephile, there's no there there.
It's a Chilean film, with a few English speaking moments but for the most part there's not a lot of words on the page.
The movie settle for beauty to plot which isn't my thing.
Final Score: 4.4/10

Atmospherics yes, it might be. But a little bit of story and/or rhythm would have helped too.

It´s a beautifully filmed movie about a bunch of ordinary kids growing up in a boring part of Chile, living their mundane lives dictated by their idealistic semi-interested parents who have comitted to a sort of lazy community life without much struggle or strife.
At the end of the movie, their easy-going lifestyle comes to an abrupt end when the entire community is engulfed in a wild forest fire. But you wouldnt know it from the faces of the jaded protagonists who are only concerned with their own well being; the only rational character is the family dog who finally breaks loose from the decadent boredom in search of some real meaningfulness.

aesthetically very pleasing, beautiful shots, round story, but you can't make an entire movie on nice shots. It's okay to leave a viewer with some questions, but I felt a bit too lost sometimes, maybe a lot of questions are unanswered because they're irrelevant, because those things could distract you from what it is you should really be focused on. For me the plot wasn't clear enough and that makes it hard to really get into a movie. Of course, you always need to break some rules while making a movie, but it's really important to know which ones to break. A movie doesn't always have to be introduction, inciting accident, journey, climax, resolution of course. Movies are not defined as good guy beats bad guy. But I think that in this movie a structure like that was missing in such a way that it makes it kind of hard to know what you should be feeling and maybe that is the point. However, it is a beautiful movie just as call me by your name and they've done an incredible job at establishing a mesmerizing ambience.
