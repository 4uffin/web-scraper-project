American Sweatshop is a cool and riveting thriller that gets under your skin, creeping up your spine to bend your brain. Like the internet videos that are its grim inspiration, it's not easy to shake off the chills American Sweatshop triggers.

As often as this film frustrated me regarding Nemeth’s shallow script, I was impressed by the choices made by Lili Reinhart, who plays Daisy’s numbness not as apathy, but something fueled by frustration and anger.
Rated: 2.5/4

American Sweatshop feels like it’s casually swiping through its themes, never coalescing into a feed as unsettling as the real thing.
Rated: C-

Lili Reinhart delivers her best role to date in this uneven but timely drama about content moderation.
Rated: 3/5

CBR
American Sweatshop is a thoughtfully dramatic examination of content moderators' mental health at its best, and a semi-tense cyberthriller at its worst.
Rated: 6/10

Cinemalogue
As it wades into the cesspool of contemporary social media and content creation, this mildly provocative thriller unfortunately softens its cynical edges while exploring the ugly moral ambiguities of online voyeurism and capitalism.

This was a very good movie, however I don’t think it’s as profound as it thinks it is, or was trying to be. The entire film revolves around one video depicting an act of violence, which granted no one should watch - or WANT to watch. But the video itself and what’s depicted was very “tame” in my opinion compared to what can actually be found on the internet at any given time.
I’m not really minimizing what happened in the video, it was terrible, but for the main character to get so completely obsessed with this one thing, and one depiction of violence? Really didn’t seem realistic to me.
Probably would have been a little more compelling if the video depicted an actual snuff film, or a murder, or something much more hard core I guess. But I just didn’t feel like I cared if the people who made the video were brought to justice, or got any comeuppance really.
They did a poor job of creating and making you hate the “villians”, and really just delved into and played up the main characters pretty irrational obsession for the whole film.
I get it, the video was disturbing, but in reality we don’t even know if the whole thing was consensual- or even if it was faked??
The end also felt a bit hypocritical, because you’re left at least assuming that the main character did something horrible (maybe even killed someone?) in response to the video and her obsession with it -
with her rationalizing that “two wrongs do make a right”?
In reality I think whatever they don’t show you her doing in the end, really wouldn’t amount to justice. It just basically would have maybe satisfied her enough to end her obsession, which seemed to be bordering on a psychosis..Was that the point?? Not sure.
Good movie again though,
glad I watched it, but could have been a little better. Reminded me of 8mm actually, but just a lot more watered down..
