American Sweatshop is a cool and riveting thriller that gets under your skin, creeping up your spine to bend your brain. Like the internet videos that are its grim inspiration, it's not easy to shake off the chills American Sweatshop triggers.

As often as this film frustrated me regarding Nemeth’s shallow script, I was impressed by the choices made by Lili Reinhart, who plays Daisy’s numbness not as apathy, but something fueled by frustration and anger.
Rated: 2.5/4

American Sweatshop feels like it’s casually swiping through its themes, never coalescing into a feed as unsettling as the real thing.

Lili Reinhart delivers her best role to date in this uneven but timely drama about content moderation.
Rated: 3/5

CBR
American Sweatshop is a thoughtfully dramatic examination of content moderators' mental health at its best, and a semi-tense cyberthriller at its worst.
Rated: 6/10

Cinemalogue
As it wades into the cesspool of contemporary social media and content creation, this mildly provocative thriller unfortunately softens its cynical edges while exploring the ugly moral ambiguities of online voyeurism and capitalism.

A movie that makes you want to cry and laugh at the absurdity and sadness and beauty of it all. The writing is genius, and the acting is stellar. Must-see.

Imagine an intelligent version of 8mm (1999) which is also a commentary on the current state of the world, driven by social media and the notions of "free speech"

Interesting premise but didn't go anywhere fast enough. Could have been a thriller or a horror. I guess the horrific aspect was people not deleting every video or quitting their jobs.

I loved everything about this movie! It has a very fresh premise and inspired deep reflection afterwards on the ethics of being an observer. While being classified as a dark thriller, the movie’s believable and likable characters retained moments of humor to break the tension. Lili knocks it out of the park with her performance. With such a beautiful actress as the leading role this movie could have easily over-sexualized her, made her a damsel in distress or overblown action hero. Instead her character had the complexities of a real woman— kind-hearted and powerful but sometimes flawed by messiness, anxiety and anger.
