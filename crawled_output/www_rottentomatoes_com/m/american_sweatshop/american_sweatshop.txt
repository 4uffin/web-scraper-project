American Sweatshop is a cool and riveting thriller that gets under your skin, creeping up your spine to bend your brain. Like the internet videos that are its grim inspiration, it's not easy to shake off the chills American Sweatshop triggers.

As often as this film frustrated me regarding Nemeth’s shallow script, I was impressed by the choices made by Lili Reinhart, who plays Daisy’s numbness not as apathy, but something fueled by frustration and anger.
Rated: 2.5/4

American Sweatshop feels like it’s casually swiping through its themes, never coalescing into a feed as unsettling as the real thing.
Rated: C-

Lili Reinhart delivers her best role to date in this uneven but timely drama about content moderation.
Rated: 3/5

CBR
American Sweatshop is a thoughtfully dramatic examination of content moderators' mental health at its best, and a semi-tense cyberthriller at its worst.
Rated: 6/10

Cinemalogue
As it wades into the cesspool of contemporary social media and content creation, this mildly provocative thriller unfortunately softens its cynical edges while exploring the ugly moral ambiguities of online voyeurism and capitalism.

I loved this movie.
I came in expecting a typical thriller, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was much more.
It’s so great to find a movie that cares about big ideas without losing the excitement and tension of the story.
Strongly recommend.

If you want to feel terrible, watch this film. Ok, the acting, directing, and the visual is good... the subject matter is simply too unhealthy.

This movie blew me away. I'm a Riverdale fan and wanted to support Lili but I didn't expect it to stay with me as much as it has.
I wasn't familiar with content moderation at all but since I've watched it I've read all about it and it's truly such a dark job. American Sweatshop could have just focused on all the effed up content out there and it still would have been interesting, but the focus was on Daisy's (Lili's) individual reaction to one specific video and the rabbit hole she went down thinking about it.
I won't give it away, but you do NOT expect what happens — I can guarantee it (sorry to all the YouTube commenter who are convinced they know what's gunna happen!)
I don't know if this is a horror movie, a psychological thriller or a drama, but
I do know Lili Reinhart was unbelievably good and more people should watch and talk about this!
