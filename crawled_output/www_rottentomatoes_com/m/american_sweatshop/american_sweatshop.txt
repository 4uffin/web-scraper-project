Mashable
American Sweatshop is a cool and riveting thriller that gets under your skin, creeping up your spine to bend your brain. Like the internet videos that are its grim inspiration, it's not easy to shake off the chills American Sweatshop triggers.

As often as this film frustrated me regarding Nemeth’s shallow script, I was impressed by the choices made by Lili Reinhart, who plays Daisy’s numbness not as apathy, but something fueled by frustration and anger.
Rated: 2.5/4

American Sweatshop feels like it’s casually swiping through its themes, never coalescing into a feed as unsettling as the real thing.

Lili Reinhart delivers her best role to date in this uneven but timely drama about content moderation.
Rated: 3/5

CBR
American Sweatshop is a thoughtfully dramatic examination of content moderators' mental health at its best, and a semi-tense cyberthriller at its worst.
Rated: 6/10

Cinemalogue
As it wades into the cesspool of contemporary social media and content creation, this mildly provocative thriller unfortunately softens its cynical edges while exploring the ugly moral ambiguities of online voyeurism and capitalism.

Loved every minute of it - this film explores a dark profession in an even darker age of digital obsession. The writing is superb!!!

Terrible.
Boring and slow with no payoff.
Huge plot holes.
You really have to suspend belief with this movie expecting a payoff that never comes.
The lead cannot act either.

I had never heard of a content moderation job before this movie. The trailer shook me because the topic was so different than everything out there. I LOVED the movie. the lead actress was a relatable, lowkey bad ass. I loved her confidence and clarity. The ending was perfect. I mean, i wanted to know more, but i thought her friends were going to be okay and admire that she was taking the vigilante route (well, hopefully). I also appreciate the interactions she had with people at her apartment (specifically with the young girl and the guy).
