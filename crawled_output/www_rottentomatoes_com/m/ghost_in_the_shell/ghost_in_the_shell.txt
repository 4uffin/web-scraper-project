Her pursuit of a man who can modify the identity of strangers leaves Motoko pondering her own makeup and what life might be like if she had more human traits. With her partner (Richard George), she corners the hacker, but her curiosity about her identity sends the case in an unforeseen direction.

As the world edges closer to the ideas that it once speculated, these images resurface in my thoughts like fragments of a future that was always meant to find us...“Ghost in the Shell” didn’t predict the future; it dissected it before it arrived...

Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell will always strike a chord with those directly affected by bodily displacement.

The drawing style is remarkable in a story that reveals a Japanese preoccupation with roboticized culture and hard-edged sexuality.

[Mamoru] Oshii’s dazzling science fiction work mixes adventure, mystery, and metaphysics in a future where humans are routinely augmented with bionics and electronic implants, and then follows it into the next evolutionary step.

It’s a film of unique and divergent opinions that remain heavily debated 25 years after its initial release.

This movie is and will always be a masterpiece of the
cyberpunk genre and movies in general.
The 4K treatment did wonders.
I only wish they also had a showing with the English cast as the dub for Ghost in the Shell was amazing.
I also wish my theater had the posters that were given out at other locations, I was really looking forward to getting one and came early just for that.

First fine watching the Japanese dub, and it definitely hit different than I remember. Perhaps some of the story was lost in translation, or maybe I see it differently now that I'm older.
Regardless, the experience was amazing, immersive, and definitely worth the price of admission. If you're a fan, I'd highly recommend making the time to see it in theatres - while you can.
