The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The Long Walk is a dystopian emotional journey with strong King-esque vibes that thoughtfully navigates themes of morality without straying from its well-trodden path.

Tribune News Service
The message of “The Long Walk” is muddled, at once hopeful and despairing.
Rated: 3/4

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
Lawrence wisely casts this film with charismatic actors who make the time pass quickly. Most of this movie is just a bunch of actors walking, with random bursts of gore and death. The chemistry between Jonsson and Hoffman carries the movie
Rated: 3/4

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

For Your Reference Podcast
Whether through age of cast compared to the age intended for the characters or fiction that leaned more towards real life, the overall messaging and tone felt uneven at times.
Rated: 3/5

For Your Reference Podcast
While it drags in places, The Long Walk is hard to shake as it lingers after the credits roll. David Johnson is endearing, yet without more on why the Walk exists, or why it’s so readily accepted, the weight doesn’t fully land.
Rated: 4/5

Mad About Movies Podcast
The plot is a bit predictable but Lawrence builds tension through the withholding of violence followed by its startling, graphic explosion. It's unsettling and visceral and the bond formed between the leads is authentic and affecting.

Kind of repetitive but honestly how creative can you get with a scenario like this lol. Overall good movie, plenty of jumps that aren’t annoying. Beautifully picked cast. And just enough emotion to tug on the heart strings. Makes me want to read the book! ◡̈

Disturbing, visually graphic violence. Very, very dark. His message is lost in the horror of the story.
