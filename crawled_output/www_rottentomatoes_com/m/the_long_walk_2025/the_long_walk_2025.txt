The message of “The Long Walk” is muddled, at once hopeful and despairing.
Rated: 3/4

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
Lawrence wisely casts this film with charismatic actors who make the time pass quickly. Most of this movie is just a bunch of actors walking, with random bursts of gore and death. The chemistry between Jonsson and Hoffman carries the movie
Rated: 3/4

Slate
Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Third Coast Review
The film manages to find multiples places where tension builds, even though all we’re watching is people putting one foot in front of the other.
Rated: 3.5/4

Algo Más Que Cine
'The Long Walk' is a grim, minimalist adaptation of Stephen King, anchored by Cooper Hoffman and David Jonsson’s performances. The dystopian world is underexplored, and the ending predictable, but the tension and human connection keep it compelling.
Rated: 7/10

Decoding Everything (Substack)
"The script also has a wonderful economy to it; we only get glimpses of the outside world but it’s enough to understand what the rules are and what the stakes are for each participant."

This movie met 2 key criteria for me - great storytelling and great character development. Because of the great storytelling and AMAZING acting performances, the characters were nuanced, compelling, and complex. There were some that I disliked but they won my heart in the end. There were some that I loved and they brought me to tears several times. Its rare these days that movies take me on a journey and I get emotionally invested. It made me laugh, cry, cringe, feel inspired, feel grateful, and empathize. My only gripe is I wish they included more backstory on how the long walk came to be. While it was talked about, I wanted to experience some of it. Otherwise there were some minor things I wish were done differently. Regardless, this is a good movie and worth the watch.

i really liked the actors and thought they did good, and the cinematography looks pretty good. But my problem was that there was a pervasive sense of the movie being taken from a book which doesn't sound bad but it is. they didn't do a good job adapting the book to screen, like they didn't really put much effort into doing it so the stuff was kinda lacking imo. worth a watch if you're interested but i wouldn't watch it a second time

Honestly? That’s a 1000/10 easy. Dark, intense, and definitely one of those stories you can’t stop thinking about after. I absolutely loved the movie and there’s nothing a disliked about it.
