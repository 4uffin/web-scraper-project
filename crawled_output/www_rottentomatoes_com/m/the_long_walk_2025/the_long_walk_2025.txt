The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The Long Walk is a dystopian emotional journey with strong King-esque vibes that thoughtfully navigates themes of morality without straying from its well-trodden path.

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
The message of “The Long Walk” is muddled, at once hopeful and despairing.
Rated: 3/4

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
Lawrence wisely casts this film with charismatic actors who make the time pass quickly. Most of this movie is just a bunch of actors walking, with random bursts of gore and death. The chemistry between Jonsson and Hoffman carries the movie
Rated: 3/4

Slate
Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate
With uneasiness and uncertainty dominating the news, it's not surprising that this bleak, depressing dirge tanked at the box-office. Instead of angst and agony, audiences are looking for optimism and an emotional escape from adversity.
Rated: 5/10

[The Long Walk] maintains King's spirit, the camaraderie of the protagonists, much like Stand By Me, and the rising suspense. [Full review in Spanish]

Marcelo Stiletano
La Nación (Argentina)
With a lean production that harks back to films shot during the pandemic, The Long Walk (a forced local title) merely follows the progress of the march through a flat and insipid narrative. [Full review in Spanish]

this movie is brutal, but so so good. I dont know how something can manage to be so incredibly brutal and incredibly wholesome at the same time, but this does it. it really really does.

The acting was fantastic. The story, to me, is analogous to life, to Capitalism, to government overreach. Very relevant for today, even though it was written long ago.

I rate it 5 stars for what I was able to see.
We had tornadoes and the theater lost power thankfully they gave us guest passes to come back.
Personally, it didn't seem like Stephen King's normal movie, but it was still great. We probably had about 30 mins left, can't wait to finish it.

This is a movie everyone over the age of 12 should see. It show how the power of friendship & selflessness can overcome any evil. Also, very timely for something that was written in the 80's.
