The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The Long Walk is a dystopian emotional journey with strong King-esque vibes that thoughtfully navigates themes of morality without straying from its well-trodden path.

Tribune News Service
The message of “The Long Walk” is muddled, at once hopeful and despairing.
Rated: 3/4

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
Lawrence wisely casts this film with charismatic actors who make the time pass quickly. Most of this movie is just a bunch of actors walking, with random bursts of gore and death. The chemistry between Jonsson and Hoffman carries the movie
Rated: 3/4

Slate
Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Decoding Everything (Substack)
"The script also has a wonderful economy to it; we only get glimpses of the outside world but it’s enough to understand what the rules are and what the stakes are for each participant."

48 Hills
It has the added self-importance its life-or-death circumstance brings, but no real depth. The competently played characters remain two-dimensional.

Yes, it’s all too much at times, but too well done to walk away from.
