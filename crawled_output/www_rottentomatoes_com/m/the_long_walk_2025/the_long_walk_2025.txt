The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The Long Walk is a dystopian emotional journey with strong King-esque vibes that thoughtfully navigates themes of morality without straying from its well-trodden path.

The message of “The Long Walk” is muddled, at once hopeful and despairing.
Rated: 3/4

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
Lawrence wisely casts this film with charismatic actors who make the time pass quickly. Most of this movie is just a bunch of actors walking, with random bursts of gore and death. The chemistry between Jonsson and Hoffman carries the movie
Rated: 3/4

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

The Long Walk could be looking at Oscar nods, especially for its leads, Jonsson and Hoffman.
The Long Walk is timely as it hits uncomfortably close to home while examining how far we would go to outlast people we barely know and haven’t had time to hate.
Rated: 4/5

About Boulder
The Long Walk is a good movie. Maybe not one of the best of the year, but it has fearsome power, and it balances that with unflinching humanity.

Subculture Entertainment
The Long Walk is not always an easy watch but it is well worth it. The brilliantly written screenplay is brought alive by a talented young cast and makes this not only a must see but one of the best thrillers you will see this year.
Rated: 4/5

SARGIO
The Long Walk is intense and riveting - who would think in a movie about people walking three miles an hour (or tragically LESS?!!).
The characters, who I thought were too old for the role in the first few introduction sequences, showed depth and courage and friendship (in most cases) - it gave the reason that they had to be older:
to take on the depth of the part and the dialogue.
Extremely graphic weapon use and emotional displays of self-sacrifice are strewn through this movie.
I found the depiction accurate and at level with the serious nature of the film but, it may be too graphic for some.
I actually found myself gripping the arms of the chair during some particularly pivotal scenes.
All in all, a great film that stayed true enough to the masterfully written book by Stephen King to warrant - only lacking 1/2 STAR due to the movie lacking in some character development or minor issues with the dialogue - a very strong rating.
Well worth the money paid and time spent.
Can't WAIT for the SEQUEL!!!
- oh, yeah - well, forget that....
