From the highly anticipated adaptation of master storyteller Stephen King's first-written novel, and Francis Lawrence, the visionary director of The Hunger Games franchise films (Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Pts. 1 & 2 , and The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes), comes THE LONG WALK, an intense, chilling, and emotional thriller that challenges audiences to confront a haunting question: how far could you go?

The Long Walk
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Cooper Hoffman and David Johnsson's soulful performances bring a lot of heart to Stephen King's dystopian tale, making The Long Walk a life-or-death ordeal for its characters but a riveting ride for audiences.

Stephen King has been adapted a lot, but this is the leanest, meanest adaptation of his work in a long time.

Daily Telegraph (UK)
...it’s not that [the film] doesn’t work (indeed, parts of it are rather good) but that it ultimately and fundamentally can’t, given what it actually is.
Rated: 2/5

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
While Lawrence keeps the momentum steady and ensures that every few minutes delivers some kind of violent jolt, there’s just not enough meat to this particular roadkill story to keep one cinematic foot in front of the other.

The M Report (WBOC.com)
This film is mainly medium shots of the guys walking with not much variety. If one considers this as akin to a slasher flick, then watching one kill after the other will probably be a draw... it feels repetitive here.

WBAL-TV (Baltimore)
As much as this film was horrifying and anxiety inducing, the film highlights how powerful and life changing friendship can be. Francis Lawrence is one of our all-time best directors.
Rated: 4/5

We trudge on, and we savor the moments, knowing that The Long Walk could just as easily be the best movie for next year, or the one after, or any other year our walk continues.

Amazing movie that has a lot of relevance in today's society. A dystopian version of Stand by Me in a sense (Era and walk among friends). It's a tough watch as you get to know these young boys but definitely sends a strong statement. Are we as a collective heading in this desensitized path? We just don't know yet, but it's a must watch!

I ENJOYED THIS FILM — THE ACTING AND DIALOGUE WERE OUTSTANDING AND THE STORY WAS EMOTIONALLY COMPELLING — THE FINALE IS A BIT UNDERWHELMING BUT THAT DOESN’T DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL STRENGTH OF THE FILM — I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND

Would have preferred they stick to the source material. Still a good watch that leaves you thinking. But the liberties they took away from the book made the story and ending less attractive.
But if you haven’t read the book I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.

Not bad. David Johnson and Mark Hamill were standouts for me. Really heartbreaking situation the young guys were in.
