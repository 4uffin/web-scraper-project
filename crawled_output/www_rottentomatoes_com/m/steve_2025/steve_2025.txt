Set in the mid-90s, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's Sunday Times bestseller Shy. The film follows a pivotal day in the life of headteacher Steve and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, we witness him grappling with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, we meet Shy, a troubled teen caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

Steve
What to Know
Critics Consensus
A sobering drama that throws everything along with the kitchen sink at its doggedly determined hero, Steve's pileup of crises can strain credulity but Cillian Murphy's superb performance keeps it grounded in reality.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
There’s a manic energy to every shaky-cam scene that, by the end, seems to be hiding something. Murphy, however, is mesmerising.

Rolling Stone UK
It’s darkly funny and thought-provoking – and as nail-biting as you might expect.
Rated: 4/5

New Statesman
Steve is a film that would not work at all with a lesser actor than Cillian Murphy at its centre. He grips your attention and demands empathy.

Reeling Reviews
Cillian Murphy was great as an empathetic small town businessman in Mielants' last film and he's even better here, simultaneously holding things together and coming apart at the seams.
Rated: B+

Grant Rollings
The Sun (UK)
Murphy puts in a great performance as Steve and the young cast are all really impressive. But the local Tory MP, journalists and trustees are all one-dimensional caricatures in this Netflix film, which bleeds liberal values from every pore.
Rated: 3/5

Terry Staunton
Radio Times
In Murphy’s title character he has helped fashion a poster child for underpaid, under-resourced workers navigating the obstacles that threaten the jobs they care passionately about.

TIFF platform - tragi-comedy much like Mielants Patrick. Brilliant performances from Murphy and Lycurgo.
The camera work is chaos but the story of Steve and SHY will break your heart and make you appreciate the amazing carers that work to save these kids.
