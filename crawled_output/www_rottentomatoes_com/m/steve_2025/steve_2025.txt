Set in the mid-90s, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's Sunday Times bestseller Shy. The film follows a pivotal day in the life of headteacher Steve and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, we witness him grappling with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, we meet Shy, a troubled teen caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
There’s a manic energy to every shaky-cam scene that, by the end, seems to be hiding something. Murphy, however, is mesmerising.
Rated: 3/5

Rolling Stone UK
It’s darkly funny and thought-provoking – and as nail-biting as you might expect.
Rated: 4/5

New Statesman
Steve is a film that would not work at all with a lesser actor than Cillian Murphy at its centre. He grips your attention and demands empathy.

Grant Rollings
The Sun (UK)
Murphy puts in a great performance as Steve and the young cast are all really impressive. But the local Tory MP, journalists and trustees are all one-dimensional caricatures in this Netflix film, which bleeds liberal values from every pore.
Rated: 3/5

Terry Staunton
Radio Times
In Murphy’s title character he has helped fashion a poster child for underpaid, under-resourced workers navigating the obstacles that threaten the jobs they care passionately about.
Rated: 4/5

Pedro Paunero
EscribiendoCine
Moving, violent, and thoughtful, Steve not only portrays the hopelessness of a generation caught between abandonment and rage, but also exposes the fragility of a system that prefers to manage chaos rather than understand it.[Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 7/10
