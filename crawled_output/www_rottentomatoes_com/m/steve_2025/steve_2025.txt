Set in the mid-90s, Steve is a reimagining of Max Porter's Sunday Times bestseller Shy. The film follows a pivotal day in the life of headteacher Steve and his students at a last-chance reform school amidst a world that has forsaken them. As Steve fights to protect the school's integrity and impending closure, we witness him grappling with his own mental health. In parallel to Steve's struggles, we meet Shy, a troubled teen caught between his past and what lies ahead as he tries to reconcile his inner fragility with his impulse for self-destruction and violence.

Steve
What to Know
Critics Consensus
A sobering drama that throws everything along with the kitchen sink at its doggedly determined hero, Steve's pileup of crises can strain credulity but Cillian Murphy's superb performance keeps it grounded in reality.

Steve is gripping and exhausting, sharing common themes with ﻿Destin Daniel Cretton’s Short Term 12﻿ and Nora Fingscheidt’s electrifying System Crasher. But this film -- and Murphy’s devastating performance -- exist in a class of their own.

At its best, we understand why these people want to keep the lights on in a dark, unforgiving world.

The Times (UK)
There’s a manic energy to every shaky-cam scene that, by the end, seems to be hiding something. Murphy, however, is mesmerising.
Rated: 3/5

Louisa Moore
Screen Zealots
An ambitious but ultimately ineffective misfire that wants to be a powerful meditation on mental health and broken institutions. Instead, it's a muddled, frustrating, and hollow experience that never finds its footing.

Tom Shone
Sunday Times (UK)
The chaos of the day is a little too infectious, but Murphy gives a beautifully raw, frazzled performance, his opaque blues eyes never far from panic.
Rated: 3/5

Reeling Reviews
Cillian Murphy was great as an empathetic small town businessman in Mielants' last film and he's even better here, simultaneously holding things together and coming apart at the seams.

I was very impressed by the performance of Emily Watson and the vivacity of the young boys.
However, I am not involved in schools let alone a special school and I really wondered whether we were being sold reality (albeit 1996) or
just the idea of what it might be like in our worst nightmares.
Do teachers normally swear that much in meetings? I can understand swearing privately as Steve does but really, as a matter of course in every meeting?
Steve is actually quite useless. He drinks an amazing amount of alcohol in any form without appearing to be affected in the least. He rushes about occasionally giving peptalks, he fails to manage any situation whatsoever and although he
seems to be dictating into a phone he never seems to finish anything. He never does anything at all.The boys riot and no teacher does anything to quell it apart from the counsellor.

“Steve”
Steve (Cillian Murphy) runs a reform school for unruly boys and is told it will shut down in a mere six months. He also has a problem with self-medicating, a BBC documentary is camped on his doorstep and an MP wants to horn in on the publicity in “Steve.”
Most people know Cillian Murphy as the Academy Award best actor winner for “Oppenheimer,” but he also does more quiet and thoughtful dramas like “Steve” and last year’s gripping “Small Things Like These.” In “Steve,” he has the weight of the world on his shoulders with his unruly, often special needs students, an overworked and underappreciated staff of dedicated educators and the abovementioned TV crew and pushy MP Montague-Powell (it is pronounced “Pole”). And, do not forget the secret self-medication for some unmentioned malady.
Murphy may be the star and titular character of “Steve,” but the supporting cast are fully fleshed out, too, with Tracy Ullman and Little Simz as dedicated and tough teachers and Jay Lycurgo as Shy, a troubled student who Steve tries to help. The rest of the kids all have personalities and play the troubled teens – they are in reform school, after all – with lots of energy and emotion.
Murphy, though, is the glue that holds the whole thing together – or, at least gives it his best shot – even when presented with the news that he has six short months to shut things down. The school, which cost 30000 pounds per year per student, is getting cut because it costs too much – which raises a question. What the hell happens to the kids? That is never explained – like the reason our leader believes the Department of Education should be abolished. It should not, by the way.

TIFF platform - tragi-comedy much like Mielants Patrick. Brilliant performances from Murphy and Lycurgo.
The camera work is chaos but the story of Steve and SHY will break your heart and make you appreciate the amazing carers that work to save these kids.
