Howl's Moving Castle has the logic of a dream: behind every door lie multiple realities, one more astonishing than the next.

[Miyazaki] may have made better films than Howl's Moving Castle, but it still exhibits his amazing imagination and astonishing detail.

Howl's Moving Castle is Japanese and anime, and therefore automatically more artistic than its US counterparts. The right cultural cachet gives you a lot of leeway.

Hayao Miyazaki’s endeavour to achieve perfection and attention to detail find their apex in Howl’s Moving Castle, Studio Ghibli’s most eccentric and intense masterpiece.
Rated: 5/5

Howl's Moving Castle's blending of 2D animation and CG firmly solidifies it as a mid-2000s hand-drawn animated affair.

A heartwarming story about the love between a cursed shopkeeper/cleaner and a whimsical sorcerer, set against a backdrop of a useless war.
Along for the ride is a friendly fire daemon, Calcifer, who is the power behind the moving castle of the title. Additionally, multiple viewings reveal a time-travel component. I'll see it again and again.

I really enjoyed the movie and the animations goes without saying. But I didn’t quite understand most of the meaning behind the movie so I dropped at star from the ratings. The movie is very deep don’t get me wrong, but there are some parts that didn’t make sense to me. I may need to watch it again
