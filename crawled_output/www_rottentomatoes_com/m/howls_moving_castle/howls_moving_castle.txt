Howl's Moving Castle has the logic of a dream: behind every door lie multiple realities, one more astonishing than the next.

[Miyazaki] may have made better films than Howl's Moving Castle, but it still exhibits his amazing imagination and astonishing detail.

Howl's Moving Castle is Japanese and anime, and therefore automatically more artistic than its US counterparts. The right cultural cachet gives you a lot of leeway.

Hayao Miyazaki’s endeavour to achieve perfection and attention to detail find their apex in Howl’s Moving Castle, Studio Ghibli’s most eccentric and intense masterpiece.
Rated: 5/5

Howl's Moving Castle's blending of 2D animation and CG firmly solidifies it as a mid-2000s hand-drawn animated affair.

This is my favorite anime movie. However, they changed the theater and that caused confusion because the seating layout was different from the assigned seats.
