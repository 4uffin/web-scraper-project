Freakier Friday
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Freakier Friday doesn't reinvent the original's story so much as it swaps the formula around for a frothy good time, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan easily slipping back into roles that fit them like mixed-and-matched gloves.

Audience Says
TGIFF! Steeped in nostalgia and bursting with good, clean fun, Freakier Friday is a heartfelt celebration of family, with Curtis and Lohan serving up all the cozy, freaky feels.

Girl Culture (Substack)
Far from a perfect movie and definitely a little overlong. But also so earnest and well-intentioned that it papered over a lot of the flaws.
Rated: B-

While watching Curtis and Lohan milk the silly premise for all its worth once again, it’s hard not to have a good time.

funny and charming ... a film that deserves to be seen with a crowd—and a friend, mom, or sister.

This setup provides a showcase for Curtis’ unique charm when she’s portraying a teenager trapped in the body of an older woman. The iconic actress gives voice to the horrors of aging ... and she’s having the time of her life doing it.
