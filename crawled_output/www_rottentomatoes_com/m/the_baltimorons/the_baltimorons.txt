On Christmas Eve, Cliff, a down-on-his luck comedian who can't catch a break, chips a tooth, and suddenly finds himself in the late-night care of Didi, a sharp-witted, no-nonsense dentist. What should have been a quick fix unfolds into an unforgettable night of unexpected twists, comic mishaps, and a brewing heartfelt connection. Their holiday misadventures lead to the discovery that the best gifts aren't under the tree--they're the ones you never saw coming.

Like the most delightful of stocking stuffers, The Baltimorons is modestly-sized but incredibly winning with its outsized charm.

Yet the story manages to put a smile on your face from time to time, despite the gloom of its humor.

It‚Äôs light on its feet but gradually gathers real emotional weight. It‚Äôs also beautifully shot and steeped in atmosphere. We walk away from it feeling like we‚Äôve actually been somewhere and felt something.

One of those little movies you might stumble across and be surprised that it hooks you. It does so despite -- or more likely because -- of its complete lack of flashiness or any self-evident attempt to ‚Äúhook you.‚Äù
Rated: 3/4

Every Movie Has a Lesson
For the audience who has missed the casualness of this style, "The Baltimorons" is comfort food not unlike the hearty plates both these characters wouldn‚Äôt mind partaking in with loved ones before the day is out.
Rated: 3/5

Mucho audience awards at regional festivals, starting with its SXSW debut, and I can see the appeal of its oddly atmospheric, winsome rendition of an ‚ÄúAfter Hours‚Äù vibe. I sat with my heart like a stone.
Rated: 1/10

The Baltimorons...fits far more into that dark, yet hopeful style of Christmas movie for those who are searching for a more subdued, but still substantial version of Christmas cheer.

I liked the way the movie moved and held my interest. The acting was superb. The story was not predictable which of course is a big plus.

Mr. Hollywood
Was a nice slice of day movie but it didnt stick the landing. It was a decent independent film but without that independent ending, it had a typical Hollywood type ending which this film didnt need and shouldve had something anything else

The Misadventures of an Awkward Sober guy and a dentist that push their loved ones to the sidelines for them to celebrate Christmas eve in Baltimore. that's it. In a world where phone communication is a rarity and only the girlfriend slaps the guy with reality checks to remind us that she still exists. now that is it.
