On Christmas Eve, Cliff, a down-on-his luck comedian who can't catch a break, chips a tooth, and suddenly finds himself in the late-night care of Didi, a sharp-witted, no-nonsense dentist. What should have been a quick fix unfolds into an unforgettable night of unexpected twists, comic mishaps, and a brewing heartfelt connection. Their holiday misadventures lead to the discovery that the best gifts aren't under the tree--they're the ones you never saw coming.

Critics Consensus
Like the most delightful of stocking stuffers, The Baltimorons is modestly-sized but incredibly winning with its outsized charm.

Yet the story manages to put a smile on your face from time to time, despite the gloom of its humor.

It’s light on its feet but gradually gathers real emotional weight. It’s also beautifully shot and steeped in atmosphere. We walk away from it feeling like we’ve actually been somewhere and felt something.

Associated Press
One of those little movies you might stumble across and be surprised that it hooks you. It does so despite -- or more likely because -- of its complete lack of flashiness or any self-evident attempt to “hook you.”
Rated: 3/4

It’s funny, complicated, and not to be missed, especially if you like a Christmas romance.

Chase Hutchinson
The Inlander (Spokane, WA)
It's like Before Sunset but with beer as opposed to wine, a great deal more mouth blood, and a Baltimore setting. This could sound like a horror film if tweaked a bit, but The Baltimorons is a bittersweet rom-com gem.

Film Obsessive
For the audience who has missed the casualness of this style, "The Baltimorons" is comfort food not unlike the hearty plates both these characters wouldn’t mind partaking in with loved ones before the day is out.
Rated: 3/5

Easily one of the worst films Ive seen this year, if not in the past five years. If I could rate it zero stars I would. A phenomenally uninteresting plot outdone only by the worlds most annoying and unlikable main character. Everything about this bothersome, unfunny, uncharismatic, problem of a human is a walking red flag. And why does every single movie about improv (that major plot point was conveniently left out of the trailer) have to explain to us what improv is?? A waste of money and time on every level. The people who made this should feel bad. The money they spent couldve fed the homeless.

for me this is the movie of the year the best writing best acting the best story it was so natural and real it's as if I knew these people I think the lead guy will be a big star and he is adorable the girl that played his fiance it's a great actress &
the other female lead as well. this is another excellent project from the duplass family and proof that you don't need big names in big studios to make a great movie

The moral of the story: if you have a fiancé with spaced teeth, feel free to leave them on Christmas Eve for your hot dentist…
