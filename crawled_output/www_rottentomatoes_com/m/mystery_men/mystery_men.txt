Champion City already has a superhero, the appropriately named Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), but that doesn't deter the city's seven quirky amateur crime-fighters, who use the Captain's capture at the hands of villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) as motivation to prove themselves. The only problem is that their strange powers -- silverware hurling, bowling, shovel skills, incompetent invisibility and deadly flatulence -- aren't doing them any favors.

Witty comic-book story is edgy, with lots of potty humor.
Rated: 3/5

Chicago Reader
The characters have been designed to make fun of themselves, disguising the craft of writer Neil Cuthbert and director Kinka Usher in getting us to laugh at them.

Time Out
Usher's amiable spoof of superhero movies takes a brave stab at rewriting the mythology from the inside out, with lots of witty, mildly subversive stuff.

Mystery Men is admirable for its effort but falls short of the standards that we've come to expect in the spoof genre.

A story that sparkles with emotional warmth, strong jokes and great performances from Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, Greg Kinnear, William Macy, Geoffrey Rush and Ben Stiller.

This is, in my opinion, THE superhero parody. It's a spot on lampooning of the MCU done before the MCU existed. The characters are gloriously wacky and unhinged in a way that speaks of a deep and profound love of four-color comics, and the art direction is - bar none - THE best art direction I have seen in ANY superhero movie, period, ever, over and out. It's worth a watch. Or three.

Mystery Men may have its flaws, but some of the most flawed people in my life are the ones I love the most. My wife and I fell in love with this picture immediately, maybe because one of its heroes is in an interracial marriage. My wife is from the Caribbean and I'm a white kid from Philly.
But its more than that, as well. The movie didn't need cursing to carry its street credibility and the cast is a powerhouse ensemble! Tom Waits as the weapons outfitter just blew me away. Hell, my generation was practically raised on his Night Owls At The Cafe! Paul Reubens comes back after the cultural assassination he undeservingly got from society, quite admirably with a character that was the only one in the group who had a deadly power! This movie makes my top five of all time favorite films and left me feeling great. The underdogs finally got their shot at being the heroes, something EVERYBODY can relate to, because very few people ever get to wear Captain Amazing's mantle in this life. The song rising over the heroes at the end was the cherry on the cake, baptizing them as the New Avengers of Champion City! Perfect!
I just wish it had made enough money at the box office to warrant a sequel. Possibly, somewhere down the road, some director will blow the dust off of this diamond in the rough, and give it another go. I would love to see it take off and become a franchise.

Filme legal, o roteiro é bacana, o elenco é bacana, o filme mostra alguns caras que querem ser super heróis mais não tem poderes, depois eles recrutam mais pessoas, uma cena bacana eles atacam os dois vilões quebrando a limosine deles com eles dentro, subindo no capo, destruindo vidros, perto do final na mansão dos vilões, o grupo de heróis sem poderes, conseguiram prender os bandidos e a mansão foi destruída, com tudo isso, o filme juntou comédia com ação e eu recomendo esse filme.

Mystery Men is an underrated gem with quirky humor and a unique spin on superhero tropes. Featuring a lovable cast of misfit heroes, including Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, and Paul Reubens as the unforgettable Spleen, the film charms with its offbeat characters and vibrant visuals. It's a fun, creative ride that shows even the most unconventional heroes can save the day. Hopefully, more people will discover it as a true cult classic, today, and in the future.
