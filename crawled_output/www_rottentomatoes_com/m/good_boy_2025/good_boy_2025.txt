Our canine hero, Indy, finds himself on a new adventure with his human owner--and best friend--Todd, leaving city life for a long-vacant family home in the country. From the start, two things are abundantly clear: Indy is wary of the creepy old house, and his affection for Todd is unwavering. After moving in, Indy is immediately vexed by empty corners, tracks an invisible presence only he can see, perceives phantasmagoric warnings from a long-dead dog, and is haunted by visions of the previous occupant’s grim death. When Todd begins succumbing to the dark forces swirling around the house, Indy must battle a malevolence intent on dragging his beloved Todd into the afterlife.

Part of the film’s terror, especially as it reaches its heartbreaking conclusion, is watching this furry innocent see its entire world come slowly crashing down around it, and not being able to comprehend why.

What could have easily been a cheap gimmick instead provides the foundation for one of the best horror films so far this year.

What comes across most strongly, and gives the film its emotional power, is Indy’s unfailing loyalty to his beloved owner and his willingness do practically anything to protect him.

While the ultimate results are a little more mixed than I’d like it does mostly end up being more than just an experiment, barking up a solid dose of jumps and jangled nerves plus a surprising amount of heart-tugging to boot

At no point during the screening did I find myself not incredibly impressed for what the cast was able to create

'Good Boy' needed something more than a beautiful dog and a new POV to be worth a trip to the theater.
