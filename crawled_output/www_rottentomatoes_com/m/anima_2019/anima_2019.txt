In a short musical film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Thom Yorke of Radiohead scores and stars in a mind-bending visual piece. Best played loud.

Critics Consensus
Thom Yorke's eerie compositions blend perfectly with Paul Thomas Anderon's ethereal direction to form a bewitching meditation on alienation and what it means to connect.

The world of Anima could easily exist in a universe, somewhere between Metropolis and THX 1138 -- evoking the underlying angst about capitalism and technology's sway over both society and the individual.
Rated: 4/5

Inspired by Carl Jung's theories of the unconsciousness, the Netflix produced Anima is everything - Brash, imperfect, absurd, honest, abstract and ultimately beautiful.

It's a montage of 3 Thom Yorke songs from Anima. It's good and the dancing's cool. But, as with anything PTA or Yorke- it's going to get waves of adulation regardless of it's quality. It's cool, it's not like I'm gonna sit around and watch it more than once.

This was fantastic. I have no deep familiarity with Yorke or Radiohead past their 1st album in the 90s, and I'm pleased to say that my ignorance made no difference in how this film hits.
It's a brilliant tapestry weaving several strands of "story" at once, none of them explicit or spelled out, some only fragments and glimpses at longer possible threads that we never fully see. It follows a sort of dream-logic that is visually consistent, brilliantly shot by PTA.
You could view this as a short art film or could just consider it an extra long music video.
Regardless of which, it is definitely art: a statement presented, full stop. Interpretation, as always, is up to the observer.

it sucks, a lack of art and just is terrible. my family (not my sister) hates this movie, it is just disgusting and features gruesome parts, such as thom yorke ripping out a womens lower intestinal track. as well as shooting her 5 times in the head with a m1911. TERRIBLE NEVER EVER WATCH

The cover and concept of this short film is pretty cool, but I guess this isn't my type of film. The music sounds good - although the film itself doesn't touch me emotionally at all. I understand the message of this film is truthful about our modern day society, but the choreography ruins it.

This is a movie that i will re-watch for sure but i will just because of the visuals. There is no story but that's understandable because this is kind of a long music video. At a first viewing i was curious what is happening but 2nd viewing was boring and the only two things i was thinking then were the metaphors and visuals. I recommend it.
