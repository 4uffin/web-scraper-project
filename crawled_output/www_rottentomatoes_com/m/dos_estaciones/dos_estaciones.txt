Dos Estaciones follows fifty-year-old businesswoman María García (Teresa Sánchez), the owner of Dos Estaciones, a once-majestic tequila factory now struggling to stay afloat. The factory is the final hold-over from generations of Mexican-owned tequila plants in the highlands of Jalisco, the rest having folded to foreign corporations. Once one of the wealthiest people in town, María knows her current financial situation is untenable. When a persistent plague and an unexpected flood cause irreversible damage, she is forced to do everything she can to save her community's primary economy and source of pride.

There’s a heaviness to [DOS ESTACIONES], but also there’s hope.

An angry film, and rightfully so, but it is also an achingly human and disarmingly beautiful one.
Rated: 3.5/4

Manohla Dargis
New York Times
At once specific and expansive, “Dos Estaciones” can be described several ways: as a drama, a character study, a meditative exploration of the ravages of globalization.

Eye for Film
While the framing of cinematographer Gerardo Guerra has a steady calm, González uses every inch of it from side to side and top to bottom to such a consummate degree that even the subtitles have to make way at one point.
Rated: 4.5/5

... The sober dissection of a woman on the brink, at any moment, of a possible emotional derailment. [Full review in Spanish]

Midnight East
an eloquent portrait of an individual – María, the owner of a tequila factory, yet it is as much a portrait of the land and the community, as the three are so closely interconnected.

Stephanie O.
Director and writer Juan Pablo González displays his true love and respect for the Mexican state of Jalisco while showing the resilience of its people through Dos Estaciones. The soothing but emotional feature, filmed in Jalisco, tells a beautiful story about one woman’s journey of legacy and loss, the painstaking process of making an artisanal bottle of tequila, and all the challenges the tequila industry has to endure.
The film in itself is timeless. It’s layered with details about craftsmanship, relationships, and so much more, from its breathtaking shots of the hills of Jalisco’s highlands to the dramatic ending that leaves viewers feeling empowered. Teresa Sánchez’s outstanding performance is nothing short of captivating.

If I wanted to watch someone take five minutes to walk to their truck, get in, attempt to start it five or six times, curse, then get it going on the seventh try, then take ten minutes to drive to work, then get out and walk up a dusty road for five minutes to get to work, just to take ten minutes to look around and talk to a few people, I would have just done that.
