Honey Don't!
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Disparate parts and desperate measures spell defeat for Ethan Coen this time around in a romp that tries to cast a wide net but will ultimately leave audiences saying, Honey Don't.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The visually striking and daring cast earns Honey, Don’t! a few watchability points -- even if it’s buried in a messy heap of stylish violence.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
One of those movies, like Super Bad, in which the title reviews the film.

Empire Magazine
There are colourful characters and cool moments to keep you entertained on the road to nowhere, but they can’t disguise the fact that this is a shaggy-dog story with no real point.
Rated: 2/5

David Walsh
World Socialist Web Site
The attitudes of the creators ... are terribly smug and supercilious. This is the complacent upper middle class portraying itself as tolerant and liberated and everyone else in America as backward and perpetually led by the nose.
Rated: 1/4

Dionar Hidalgo
Algo Más Que Cine
A quirky noir with strong performances from Qualley and Plaza, Honey Don’t! entertains briefly but collapses under its own chaotic plot and uneven humor.
Rated: 4/10

Vague Visages
a flat, uninspired retread of Coen's most beloved films, executed without any semblance of imagination or inspiration.

Not even worth the electricity it would take to pirate the movie.
Actually the worst movie I have ever watched.
As others have said, the title is a warning... "Honey Don't (Watch This Garbage)"
The whole time we were shocked at how much this movie tries to go for a shock factor with graphic sex scenes, and that's not even the worst part. The acting was dry and the lines were unnatural. The only good actors in this film were Chris Evans and Honey's nephew. Even Charlie Day's lines and acting come off unnatural and robotic, though this can be attributed to the script. Same goes for Margaret Qualley and Audrey Plaza. Very unfortunate the
script was so atrocious because we know these to be interesting actors.
A nonsense third act. A "plot twist" that felt like Coen threw darts at a board to decide who the villain would be. A detective movie with no "detecting." One of the main "villains" of what I can only assume was a C-plot gets killed off screen.
Macaroni. Absolute macaroni movie. (Reference to the only good scene in the film, where Evans describe something undesired as Macaroni.)
A drunk child could ramble a more coherent plot line about a dream they had a year before.
What year is this even supposed to be set in? Mentions Covid, but Honey jokes about carrying quarters for pay phones. (Day makes light of this joke and temporal incongruency discussing cars backfiring) Accents all over the place, we hear transatlantic and southern in California.
Very nice colors, some interesting shots. Wish they would have done more to highlight the environment the characters are in. Visually actually very nice. Costume design was very nice as well.
