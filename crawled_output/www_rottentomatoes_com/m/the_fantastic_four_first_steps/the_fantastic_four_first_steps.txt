Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, Marvel Studios' "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" introduces Marvel's First Family--Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm/Invisible Woman (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm/Human Torch (Joseph Quinn) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus (Ralph Ineson) and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer (Julia Garner). And if Galactus' plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren't bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal.

Audiences shouldn’t have to sacrifice eye-catching stunts and imagery for great writing and acting. They should have it all. Should but won’t in this case.

Even if you don't like the film, it is absolutely worth it for the furniture.

Sure, some of it’s CGI overload, but Shakman assures consistency within a distinctive visual style that’s as close as the MCU comes to auteurism.

Shenkman makes this world feel grounded in a way that, even when it threatened to careen off course, I rarely found myself doubting the earnestness of what appears on screen.

It’s still a superhero movie, and it connects to the next phase of Marvel crossover films. However, it taps into some real human elements.

Visually stunning. Universal themes. Esoteric symbolism made ending stuff a bit obvious to me, but you will get the power when you know what the nemesis needs.

Liked it as a standalone in the Marvel universe. It was a breath of fresh air to see something different that didn’t have to be tied to everything else.
