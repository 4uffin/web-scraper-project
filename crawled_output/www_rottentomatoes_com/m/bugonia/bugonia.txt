Critics Consensus
Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons are at the top of their game in Bugonia, a bonkers entertainment that applies director Yorgos Lanthimos' whip-smart method to modern society's madness.

The story is pointedly not for everyone, but I enjoyed its twisted deviltry.

Kristen Lopez
The Film Maven
Yorgos Lanthimos wants you to care about the planet. If only to save your own skin. Such is the case with his latest feature, Bugonia, an incredibly quirky call to arms about the beauty of our world and how hellbent we are on destroying it.
Rated: B+

Siddhant Adlakha
Observer
In an era where it’s become all too easy to release simple, didactic “eat the rich” stories, Lanthimos’s comedy-thriller zeroes in on the compelling cognitive dissonance that might lead one down a path of reckless lone-wolf violence
Rated: 3.5/4

Phil Walsh
Geek Vibes Nation
Lanthimos crafts his boldest film yet, which features a devilishly unhinged performance by Jesse Plemons and a calculated killer turn by Emma Stone. In a study on the conspiracy mind, the film plunges deeper than a black comedy on brain rot.
Rated: 10/10

Alex Billington
FirstShowing.net
It's a remarkably fun and fresh new version of this story, with an improved finale and better performances from the cast as they all get lost in the madness of the situation.
Rated: 8.5/10

The Playlist
“Bugonia” might be as blissfully bonkers as the era of its release, yet don’t let that distract from what a masterclass in directorial control the film represents for Yorgos Lanthimos.
Rated: A-
