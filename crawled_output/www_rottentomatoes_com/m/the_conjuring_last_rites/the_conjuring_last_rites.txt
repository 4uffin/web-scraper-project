The Conjuring: Last Rites
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Purportedly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's final outing as the Warrens, Last Rites underwhelms as a climactic chapter for The Conjuring but solidly upholds the franchise's spooky standards.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The performances still possess in The Conjuring, and while Last Rites maintains its signature eerie atmosphere, this conclusion falls short of the scare power of earlier installments.

Bill Goodykoontz
Arizona Republic
Thanks to Wilson and Farmiga, who know the exact register of intensity to play these characters, itâ€™s easy to remain invested in Ed and Lorraine, their work and their love slightly out of time.
Rated: 3/5

Maxwell Rabb
Chicago Reader
It might not conjure something phenomenal, but, for longtime fans, itâ€™s a mostly fitting curtain call for a franchise that always believed in its own ghosts.

Ed Potton
The Times (UK)
Such subtlety has largely vanished by the final reel, sadly, but this is still a suitably shiver-inducing farewell to the Warrens.
Rated: 4/5

Emily Wheeler Movie Ops
What weâ€™re left with is a shell of itself, but as long as Wilson and Farmiga are there to navigate whatâ€™s left, the Conjuring movies will always bring just enough to be worthwhile.

Surya Komal
Just for Movie Freaks
The Conjuring: Last Rites succeeds as a heartfelt farewell to Ed and Lorraine Warren, even if it doesnâ€™t fully deliver on the franchiseâ€™s trademark horror.
Rated: 3/5
