The Conjuring: Last Rites
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Purportedly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson's final outing as the Warrens, Last Rites underwhelms as a climactic chapter for The Conjuring but solidly upholds the franchise's spooky standards.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The performances still possess in The Conjuring, and while Last Rites maintains its signature eerie atmosphere, this conclusion falls short of the scare power of earlier installments.

Thanks to Wilson and Farmiga, who know the exact register of intensity to play these characters, it’s easy to remain invested in Ed and Lorraine, their work and their love slightly out of time.
Rated: 3/5

Chicago Reader
It might not conjure something phenomenal, but, for longtime fans, it’s a mostly fitting curtain call for a franchise that always believed in its own ghosts.

Ed Potton
The Times (UK)
Such subtlety has largely vanished by the final reel, sadly, but this is still a suitably shiver-inducing farewell to the Warrens.
Rated: 4/5

What we’re left with is a shell of itself, but as long as Wilson and Farmiga are there to navigate what’s left, the Conjuring movies will always bring just enough to be worthwhile.

Just for Movie Freaks
The Conjuring: Last Rites succeeds as a heartfelt farewell to Ed and Lorraine Warren, even if it doesn’t fully deliver on the franchise’s trademark horror.
Rated: 3/5

I love the fact that it’s based on a true story even though the movies are a bit exaggerated. I still love a good ghost/scary
story.

Movie was really well put together! In my opinion the movie wasn’t as scary as some of the other titles but I had a blast and would go again!

I loved all aspects to this movie. I enjoyed the jump-scares and the romance in the movie as well.
