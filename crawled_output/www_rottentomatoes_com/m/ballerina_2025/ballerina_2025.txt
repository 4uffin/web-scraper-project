Ballerina
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Equipping a steely Ana de Armas with creatively brutal action choreography and a pleasingly kooky origin story, Ballerina pirouettes gracefully onto the Wickverse's centerstage.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Ana de Armas is a lethal and graceful action hero in Ballerina, a stellar pivot from the John Wick franchise that stylishly delivers a new violent dance with death.

Ballerina is a mixed bag, one that takes far too much time to get going. But when it does, this latest foray into the insane world of the High Table has plenty to offer.
Rated: 2.5/4

NPR
The unwieldy title's a clue to an unwieldy structure, but director Len Wiseman provides mayhem enough to keep fans occupied until John Wick 5 arrives.

Stephen Romei
The Australian
This movie is more or less two hours of Eve killing people. The plot is full of holes and the only good lines in the script come when John Wick reappears.
Rated: 2/5

Book & Film Globe
The best part about watching Eve in face-off after face-off is the messiness.

Ballerina is an entertaining â€“though clearly minorâ€“ addition to the lucrative John Wick universe. [Full Review in Spanish]

Leandro Ariel Porcelli
CinÃ©filo Serial
A fairly generic first act leads to surprisingly exciting developments thanks to it's willingness to prioritize fun, the usual excellence of the franchise's stunt sequences and Ana de Armas' more than competent action star skills. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

I hated this movie!!
Boring!
The story was all about stunts.
They fight through the whole movie.
Everything in it was like a cartoon, none of it could really happen.
It was all unbelievable. No character development! Again, boring and frustrating to watch. I suffered through it.
If you like watching stuntmen and stunt women do a bunch of tricks and never never die and get hurt , then this movie is for you . Don't waste your money !!

It felt like it was supposed to be better on its own, but couldn't, so it slapped a John Wick theme onto it and guess what? That didn't help much. It's an action movie, so take it for what it's worth.
