Guardian
This is a dynamically shot and earnestly performed real-life disaster movie... I would have liked to see something on the closing credits about the increasing incidence of these wildfires. This is the point, and the film is in danger of missing it.
Rated: 3/5

Greengrass knows how to shoot and cut, but “The Lost Bus” is at once too high-minded and too exploitative to work.

Greengrass shoots all this with a visual style that goes all the way to eleven.

Cinemalogue
Within the framework of a cheesy throwback disaster epic, it's sharply crafted and tightly focused enough to generate some heat.

Assignment X
A fitting tribute to their efforts and those of the emergency services – and a condemnation of the corporate irresponsibility that caused the disaster.
Rated: B

Decider
A tale of simple townsfolk rising to the occasion, its action movie structure never betrays its somber reality. Instead, its Hollywood stylings take what might otherwise be seen at a documentarian remove and make it feel intense and immediate

Gateway abroad e
The Lost Bus is a gripping disaster-thriller that pulses with raw intensity. Directed by Paul Greengrass and anchored by a powerful performance from Matthew McConaughey, the film dramatizes the 2018 Camp Fire with visceral realism. The transformation of nature into a merciless antagonist, the panic in tight, smoky interiors, and the emotional stakes—especially involving the children and their teacher—keep viewers on edge. While some of the character backstory feels heavy-handed, the action sequences more than compensate. For audiences in Jaipur, Gateway Abroad jaipur(gatewayabroadeducations.com) offers tickets and international cinema guidance—this one’s worth catching in a big screen setup.

By far one of my favorite movies with Matthew mcConaughey he deserves an award for this one. The reality of this movie and what happen during that fire is ao mind blowing. The fact that thr real guy Kevin was able to figure out a plan and deliver in such a frightening situation i command him. This is a must see ans for sure will have you on the edge of your seat everyone must see this movie

I recently watched The Lost Bus and decided to share my thoughts here on https://salalahoman22.com.
From the very beginning, the film pulls you into its mysterious atmosphere. The story blends suspense and psychological tension in a way that keeps you engaged, especially as the main character goes through a powerful journey from fear to confrontation.
Visually, the movie stands out with its dark tones, clever use of shadows, and tight camera angles that make you feel trapped inside the bus yourself. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the mood—sometimes quiet, sometimes intense, but always fitting.
On the downside, a few parts felt a little slow, and certain plot twists were somewhat predictable. Still, these moments didn’t take away too much from the overall experience.
In short, The Lost Bus is definitely worth watching if you enjoy mystery and psychological thrillers. I’d personally give it 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5. It’s not about nonstop action—it’s about atmosphere, tension, and a story that makes you think.
