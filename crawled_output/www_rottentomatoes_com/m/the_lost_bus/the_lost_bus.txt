Peter Bradshaw
Guardian
This is a dynamically shot and earnestly performed real-life disaster movie... I would have liked to see something on the closing credits about the increasing incidence of these wildfires. This is the point, and the film is in danger of missing it.
Rated: 3/5

Greengrass knows how to shoot and cut, but “The Lost Bus” is at once too high-minded and too exploitative to work.

Greengrass shoots all this with a visual style that goes all the way to eleven.

Sure, McConaughey is much more handsome and fit than the real Kevin McKay. But it’s that dashing quality that so well serves a movie as breathtaking, literally, as “The Lost Bus.” He commands it, leaving no doubt he and it are certifiably el caliente.
Rated: B

I recently watched The Lost Bus and decided to share my thoughts here on https://salalahoman22.com.
From the very beginning, the film pulls you into its mysterious atmosphere. The story blends suspense and psychological tension in a way that keeps you engaged, especially as the main character goes through a powerful journey from fear to confrontation.
Visually, the movie stands out with its dark tones, clever use of shadows, and tight camera angles that make you feel trapped inside the bus yourself. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the mood—sometimes quiet, sometimes intense, but always fitting.
On the downside, a few parts felt a little slow, and certain plot twists were somewhat predictable. Still, these moments didn’t take away too much from the overall experience.
In short, The Lost Bus is definitely worth watching if you enjoy mystery and psychological thrillers. I’d personally give it 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5. It’s not about nonstop action—it’s about atmosphere, tension, and a story that makes you think.
