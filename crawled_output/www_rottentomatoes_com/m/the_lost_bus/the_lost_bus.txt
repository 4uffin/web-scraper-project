If one accepts this is a Hollywoodized fictionalization of real events and allows the filmmaking to take over, “The Lost Bus,” at its best, can be an exciting, engrossing trip.
Rated: 2.5/4

This is a dynamically shot and earnestly performed real-life disaster movie... I would have liked to see something on the closing credits about the increasing incidence of these wildfires. This is the point, and the film is in danger of missing it.
Rated: 3/5

Greengrass knows how to shoot and cut, but “The Lost Bus” is at once too high-minded and too exploitative to work.

It’s the screenplay that’s surprisingly clunky, finding the writers laboring to add characterization whenever possible, making sure everything is nicely spelled out for viewers instead of delivering something more primal to fit a survival picture.

It is a shot of adrenaline right to the heart that keeps all but the coolest of cucumbers staring at the screen. However, the film’s postlude reminds the audience that there was little beyond that adrenaline.

In Review Online
If there was ever any chance his point-A-to-point-B driving movie would match the white-knuckle intensity of antecedents like The Wages of Fear and Sorcerer, by the end of act two it’s entirely up in smoke.

While it undeniably boasts superb execution on both sides of the camera, it is an assault on the senses in a way I've not ever experienced before - and I assure you the bigger the screen, the bigger the assault. I left the imax screening dizzy, exhausted, and shook. The authenticity achieved is remarkable, the energy, tension, and heat are ratcheted up to maximum levels. The direction is excellent, the performances are soaked in empathy, and the tragedy is truly oppressive. You would be forgiven however, if leaving the theater with a hint of the thought, "just because the cinematic treatment can be give to some things, I'm not so sure that means it should be."

"The Lost Bus" is a propulsive and heart-pounding disaster thriller that combines the excitement of an old-school disaster spectacle with a fly-on-the-wall portrait of institutions struggling to function in the face of a calamity. Paul Greengrass has long been fascinated with real-world stories where ordinary people face extraordinary, high-stakes situations. From "Bloody Sunday" to "United 93" to "Captain Phillips" to "22 July," his signature handheld realism and documentary-like urgency amplify the tension while never losing sight of human resilience. In "The Lost Bus," he turns his camera to the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in California history, adapting Lizzie Johnson’s book Paradise: One Town’s Struggle to Survive an American Wildfire into a harrowing yet inspiring survival drama.
At the center is Kevin McKay (Matthew McConaughey), a struggling bus driver who is drowning in personal burdens: he is divorced, distanced from his son, caring for his ailing mother, and watching his beloved dog fade away. He’s a man who can’t catch a break. When the Camp Fire explodes near the town of Paradise, he faces a fateful decision: rush home to protect his sick child or answer the call to shepherd 23 stranded schoolchildren and their teacher, Mary Ludwig (America Ferrera), to safety. Choosing duty over self, Kevin climbs behind the wheel of the bus, unknowingly embarking on one of the most terrifying rides of his life.
What follows is a hellish odyssey through flames, smoke, and collapsing infrastructure. Greengrass captures the evacuation with his trademark urgency: the camera vibrates with the chaos of traffic jams, the panic of families separated, and the claustrophobic fear of children who don’t fully grasp the danger but feel it in their bones. Ferrera’s Mary becomes the emotional anchor, calming her students while supporting Kevin’s increasingly desperate navigation. Together, they embody the film’s beating heart — two ordinary people rising to the extraordinary.
The screenplay, co-written by Greengrass and Brad Ingelsby (master of HBO limited series Mare of Easttown and Task), wisely intercuts Kevin and Mary’s struggle with the broader firefighting efforts, giving context to the impossible scale of the disaster. Supporting actors Yul Vazquez and Ashlie Atkinson bring humanity to the townspeople caught in the chaos, reminding us that Paradise was not just a town, but a community torn apart in a matter of hours.
McConaughey delivers one of his best and most grounded performances in years. Stripped of swagger, he plays Kevin as weary but determined, a man who finds purpose in protecting these children even as his own life crumbles. Ferrera matches him with quiet strength, embodying both a teacher’s instinct and a surrogate mother’s care. Together, they carry the film’s emotional weight.
The production, co-produced by Jason Blum and Jamie Lee Curtis, never shies away from the horror. The fire itself is rendered with chilling realism, a wall of flame that feels less like a natural disaster and more like a living, consuming monster. At times, the experience borders on horror cinema, but Greengrass’ steady hand keeps the focus on survival, not spectacle. Cinematographer Pal Ulvik Rokseth’s handheld camera work in the Barry Ackroyd docudrama style, some really slick editing from William Goldenberg and canny use of real news footage, combined with impressive CGI, give it all a pulse-raisingly immersive quality, like a plunge into the fiery underworld of California.
If there’s a flaw, it’s that the film occasionally leans too heavily on the mechanics of the escape, leaving some character arcs underdeveloped. Still, the momentum rarely falters, and the sheer stakes of watching a bus full of children navigate through an inferno are more than enough to keep audiences gripped.
Ultimately, "The Lost Bus" is more than a survival story. It’s a testament to courage, community, and sacrifice in the face of unthinkable devastation. Anchored by McConaughey and Ferrera and guided by Greengrass’ unflinching eye, it’s a film that reminds us of the human capacity to endure and to protect, even when the world is burning down around us.

The Lost Bus is a gripping disaster-thriller that pulses with raw intensity. Directed by Paul Greengrass and anchored by a powerful performance from Matthew McConaughey, the film dramatizes the 2018 Camp Fire with visceral realism. The transformation of nature into a merciless antagonist, the panic in tight, smoky interiors, and the emotional stakes—especially involving the children and their teacher—keep viewers on edge. While some of the character backstory feels heavy-handed, the action sequences more than compensate. For audiences in Jaipur, Gateway Abroad jaipur(gatewayabroadeducations.com) offers tickets and international cinema guidance—this one’s worth catching in a big screen setup.

I recently watched The Lost Bus and decided to share my thoughts here on https://salalahoman22.com.
From the very beginning, the film pulls you into its mysterious atmosphere. The story blends suspense and psychological tension in a way that keeps you engaged, especially as the main character goes through a powerful journey from fear to confrontation.
Visually, the movie stands out with its dark tones, clever use of shadows, and tight camera angles that make you feel trapped inside the bus yourself. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the mood—sometimes quiet, sometimes intense, but always fitting.
On the downside, a few parts felt a little slow, and certain plot twists were somewhat predictable. Still, these moments didn’t take away too much from the overall experience.
In short, The Lost Bus is definitely worth watching if you enjoy mystery and psychological thrillers. I’d personally give it 3.5 to 4 stars out of 5. It’s not about nonstop action—it’s about atmosphere, tension, and a story that makes you think.
