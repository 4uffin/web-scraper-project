A raw, fly-on-the-wall documentary about Francis Ford Coppola's decades-long journey in creating his self-financed passion project, Megalopolis. The bold and unrelenting epic returns in Mike Figgis' portrait of Coppola's creative process -- weaving together archival material, unfiltered cast interviews, and a close-up view of how the legendary filmmaker drew from Roman history, political allegory, and his own singular vision to shape the world of Megalopolis. This isn't a record of a production on the brink, it's a personal memoir unfolding in real time.

Austin Chronicle
Figgis captures Coppola as a black box theatre director working on a blockbuster budget, the mistakes and asides all part of his process.

Actors, and especially actors who dream of working with Coppola, may get more out of 'Megadoc' than the rest of us could.

Looking at these actors and images and the work that went into making it, made me appreciate it even more and made me want to see it again.

MegaDoc functions as a bit of a Rorschach test for cinephiles... {it] won’t be the final word on Megalopolis, but it will invite more conversation. If nothing else, that’s certainly in keeping with the Megalopolis ethos.

Junk. The whole point of being an actor is to portray someone different than yourself. This is possible because the camera is only permitted to record you for a fixed period. Add a 24/7 documentary into the chaos, and the actors now feel compelled to indefinitely bring their A-game. It's terrifying. A meltdown or moment of entitlement could end a career. It's the same way you feel when you invite your in-laws whom then overstay at your house. There is no one there to yell "cut" and mean it. For actors, too afraid for their careers to deny Higgis any camera access, this has to be exhausting. And so what you get is crap. The stuff of low production value. On film. In the documentary. And in reality.

It’s a great journey into one of most disastrous films of all time. This doc really explains why: The dude just wanna have fun and enjoy process and nothing more.
As he explains in doc, he has all the money, fame, recognition, and Oscars he ever wanted so now it’s just about having fun.
Lots of great interactions among famous actors involved and great insights into process from industry costumers to cinematographers to set designers and more.
But funniest segments involve Shia LaBeouf and Coppola interactions where they just don’t get along for some strange reasons.
I would not really mind if this was longer because it felt short since this is a very interesting and funny doc.

Not a particularly insightful documentary. One cannot doubt Coppola's genius- win, lose or draw. He is an inspiration at any age and a true force to be reckoned with. Yet leave it to Aubrey Plaza to improvise a scene with the great Dustin Hoffman- a mock arm-wrestling sequence that is the entertainment that this documentary desperately needs. All you hear Coppola say is that he wants to have fun! At least Plaza, Hoffman, Jon Voight, Giancarlo Esposito and at one point Chloe Fineman have enough sense to have fun for the audience's expense. Meanwhile Adam Driver and Nathalie Emmanuel are nowhere to be found. I would rather watch Shia Lebeouf passionately interact with Coppola and get under his skin than what Mike Figgis came up with as far as a narrative. At the very least, you can appreciate Lebeouf's determination to make a better film. All in all- the production of Megalopolis is massive, and it is inspiring to see Coppola handle whatever challenges comes his way. There are many interesting items in this documentary- Virginia Madsen reading for a part many years ago comes to mind. Noone doubts the amount of work the art department for example put into this massive film and undertaking. The fact that the film got made with Coppola's wife slowly passing is a miracle in itself. Unfortunately, this is not Hearts of Darkness. As a documentary- it is all over the place. But once again Aubrey Plaza SHINES and proves why she was not only up for the challenge of the movie, but willing to entertain us in a documentary. Figgis had enough sense to put her and Hoffman on camera for their brief scene. It is a highlight.

It offers a lot of insight into Coppola's process and, at least for me, answers some lingering questions about "Megalopolis". Additionally the transparency here is kind of shocking. You cannot imagine this honest behind the scenes glimpse into any other movie these days.
