From familial tensions and torrid love affairs to untimely deaths and societal shifts, the Crawleys provide a compelling look at the final days of aristocracy...

What, you may ask, distinguishes "Downton Abbey" on the big screen from its smaller kin? Well, the movie is twice as long...

Fans will just be happy to get another dose regardless of how it compares to other movies. As another chapter, it does the job even if it feels as if they struggled to fill a little over two hours without running out of material.

The film is a little bit arch and a little bit twee but that that is only to be expected.
Rated: 4/5

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
The Downton Abbey movie is just a longer episode of the tv series. As a longtime Downton fan myself, I left the theater entertained, but disappointed.
Rated: 6.5/10

I so enjoyed all the seasons on tv. The movie was not as well done as the seasons. It did however wrap up many things left in completed at the end of season 6. Overall glad I saw it.

If youre a Downtown fan, youll really enjoy this. I think the viewing pleasure is enhanced by knowing all the background and personalities already.
But for someone whos not familiar with the show, they do a good job of some intertwined explaining- thevrepartee of the characters are fun,
and the various plot lines keep your interest.
And of course, the costuming, sets, vistas all immerse you.

Boring.
I had a difficult time keeping up with all the characters and who they were.
Gay scenes were unnecessary in this story.
