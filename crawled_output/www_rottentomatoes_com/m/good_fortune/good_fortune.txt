Peter Debruge
Variety
The comedian might not be this generation's Frank Capra, but it's still nice to see a celebrity who recognizes what normal folks are going through and uses his platform to address it.

Michael Rechtshaffen
The Hollywood Reporter
Summoning those deadpan days of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure and Parenthood, Reeves’ determined but out-of-his-depths Gabriel consistently scores as the film’s comedic secret weapon.

Screen International
A blistering barrage of jokes backed by immense heart, Good Fortune is a surprising gift.

Next Best Picture
“Good Fortune” is an amusing effort from Ansari, but one can’t help but leave it wanting a bit more, especially from someone of his caliber of talent.
Rated: 5/10

The Verge
This movie gets by purely on its jokes. It’s a pretty straightforward mixture of Freaky Friday and It’s A Wonderful Life...

Good Fortune” is a refreshing comedy that audiences haven’t seen in a while, a movie with a message that both advocates for a cause and entertains.
Rated: A-
