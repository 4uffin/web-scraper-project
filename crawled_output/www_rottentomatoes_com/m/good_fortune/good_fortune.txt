Good Fortune is a good time, and Keanu Reeves in Good Fortune should not be missed.

Variety
The comedian might not be this generation's Frank Capra, but it's still nice to see a celebrity who recognizes what normal folks are going through and uses his platform to address it.

Michael Rechtshaffen
The Hollywood Reporter
Summoning those deadpan days of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure and Parenthood, Reeves’ determined but out-of-his-depths Gabriel consistently scores as the film’s comedic secret weapon.

We're Watching What?!
Keanu Reeves is perfect. While Ansari didn't necessarily need to star in his own directorial debut, the pairing of Rogen & Reeves makes it worth it. At times its a bit inside baseball, but still a solid comedy that Reeves elevates to a very worthy watch.

Next Best Picture
“Good Fortune” is an amusing effort from Ansari, but one can’t help but leave it wanting a bit more, especially from someone of his caliber of talent.
Rated: 5/10

The Verge
This movie gets by purely on its jokes. It’s a pretty straightforward mixture of Freaky Friday and It’s A Wonderful Life...
