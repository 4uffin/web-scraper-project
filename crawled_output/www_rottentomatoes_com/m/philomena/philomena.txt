The Spectator
It is quiet, restrained, unfussy, and has, at its heart, an injustice so grave it will make your blood boil. You will also cry.

Despite its weighty themes, Stephen Frears' film is almost as much a comedy as a drama.
Rated: 5/5

Bitch Media
The movie is a bit of a puzzle coming from atheist co-writer Steve Coogan and the script grapples with these big questions of religion, class, and justice in a way that's far beyond the typical teary human-interest story.

Every Movie Has a Lesson
This is a true story that is unexpectedly mysterious through its small narrative turns, with revelations that evolve in stern directions of seriousness and larger issues at play.

While several dramatic liberties were taken with the actual true account, most of them help make this a better film.

My wife being a huge fan of Steve Coogan obliged me to watch this. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this at all but found myself swept away by the wonderful performances and riviting true story. An acting masterclass and something of a mini masterpiece truth be told.

Such a beautiful movie and Judy Dench was amazing as to be expected...she absolutely pulls you in from the moment she appears on the screen, and the acting is superb...I found myself lost in the sadness, hope, and freeness of her character...just lovely; I always watch this movie when I want a good cry.

One day, at a formal dinner, a waitress named Jane approaches journalist Martin Sixsmith, who is going through a creative and professional crisis. She tells him about her mother, Philomena. As a young girl, Philomena became pregnant, after which her father disowned her and sent his wayward daughter to a convent. A few years later, Philomena’s child, Anthony, was given up for adoption to an American family. Only fifty years later does Philomena get the chance to find her son, with the help of the persistent and skilled Martin.
An excellent, heartfelt, and moving film, based on the real-life story of an unfortunate woman uncovered by journalist Martin Sixsmith. He later wrote the book "The Lost Child of Philomena Lee," which was adapted for the screen by Stephen Frears. I can’t say for certain how much the story was altered during the writing of the book and its film adaptation, but I really want to believe that it all happened exactly this way, because the story is so touching and full of meaning that you couldn’t make it up if you tried.
It’s actually quite difficult to summarise in just a few words what Philomena is really about. On one hand, it’s simply an engaging story with a gripping premise, unexpected twists, and a truly powerful conclusion. On the other hand, the film explores timeless themes: faith in miracles, maternal love carried through the years, the gap between the poor and the wealthy, and even deep questions related to religion. It’s no wonder that one of the most impactful scenes, in my opinion, is one of the final ones in the convent — when three very different characters clash: Martin, Philomena, and the stubborn Catholic nun Sister Hildegarde.
From a technical standpoint, Philomena is close to perfect. The plot moves along briskly without dragging or stalling, the acting duo of Steve Coogan and Judi Dench is outstanding, and the soundtrack is simply exquisite — it becomes an inseparable part of the story. In short, I have nothing to complain about. It’s wonderful how such technical precision harmonises so well with a simple yet profound, life-affirming story. A truly soulful film, without excessive sentimentality or syrupy clichés. I highly recommend it!

Just watched it again for the second time. Powerfully touching and horrifying at the same time, because it’s a true story. Great performance by Judi Dench.

Beautifully acted by Judy Dench and to a lesser extent Steve Coogan. A powerful tear jerker of a film. Well worth watching. Judy Dench is so good.
