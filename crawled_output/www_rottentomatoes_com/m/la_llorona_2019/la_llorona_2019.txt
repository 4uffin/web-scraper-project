Anna Smith
Deadline Hollywood Daily
While there are moments of effective suspense, this isn't shooting for a typical horror tone. The terrors of this film are the realities of genocide -- for indigenous women in particular.

The cast has an unprecedented chemistry that is held together by actress Maria Mercedes Coroy and her incredible on screen presence.
Rated: 3.5/5

Los Angeles Times
"La Llorona" avoids the tropes of horror... Instead, this smart and elegant film feels like a languid bit of cinematic magical realism where strange things happen - and the real horror lies not in the supernatural but in the savage acts of men.

InSession Film
Using his home country’s tragic history as a backdrop, Guatemalan director Jayro Bustamante’s horror story is filled with political commentary and indigenous folk.

Keith & the Movies
You get the sense something otherworldly is going on, but Bustamante maintains a savvy ambiguity and never loses sight of his deeper aim – to lay bare his home country’s bloody and oppressive past.
Rated: 4/5

Without delving into mysticism, the film delivers great suspense supported in acting, sound and the beauty of not showing too much. I was amazed this genre-bending movie was actually a success. [Full review in Spanish]

'La Llorona' is too slow paced for my liking, it most certainly isn't a bad film though. I just couldn't lock on to what I was watching, every now and then it would hook me in but then I mostly detached again not long later. That's a shame, because there is goodness in this.
It's more political drama than horror, not that the latter element is absent but I was anticipating more supernatural to this. That's mostly on me admittedly, probably not helped by the fact that I saw 'The Curse of La Llorona' (also 2019, curiously) last month; that is a more typical horror flick, which I (unlike most) liked fwiw.
No-one truly stands out from the cast, though Sabrina De La Hoz, Margarita Kenéfic, María Mercedes Coroy and Julio Díaz do warrant fair praise. If we're talking merit, those behind the actors offscreen would deserve just as much as those front and centre; it is a well shot flick. for example.
Not bad, just not good. In my eyes, of course.

Kyle M
While most flicks would depict the La Llorona tale as a jolty, nonsensical conduit for “scares”, the approach here seems more reverent and proper, weaving through political contexts in punishing one for his sins in a psychological matter. However, it was unfortunately misleading when setting up fearful expectations only to find this comparably bland albeit very few minor kicks. (B-)

Its a little obvious but at least that leads to a certain admirable bluntness to the narrative.

A former dictator is accused of the brutal genocide of a native community during the Guatemalan Civil War. During trial, the retired general lives with his family in seclusion, while the protestants manifest outside their mansion. "La Llorona" is a psychological drama focused on a family tormented by the sins of the past. A social analysis of a country's bloody past.
