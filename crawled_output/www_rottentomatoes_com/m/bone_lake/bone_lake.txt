A film that feels like a European relationship drama for about an hour before exploding in remarkably bloody chaos.

Bone Lake is wickedly fun rather than measuredly incisive.

Anton Bitel
SciFiNow
There is always, underlying these sweaty, sexy tropes, the insidious threat of a more visceral danger.
Rated: 4/5

Bone Lake isn’t as clever or subversive or even sexy as it thinks it is, but it has fun trying.
Rated: 3/5

Jennie Kermode
Eye for Film
Director Mercedes Bryce Morgan plies her trade with a style and verve which elevate this far above the 1980s straight-to-VHS erotic thrillers that it superficially resembles.
Rated: 4/5

Ben Robins
HeyUGuys
Both a very well-observed horror of manners that very cleverly unpicks the sexual politics of long term relationships, and just a big, bloody crowdpleaser.
Rated: 4/5
