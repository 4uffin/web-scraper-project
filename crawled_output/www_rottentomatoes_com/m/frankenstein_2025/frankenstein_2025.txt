What to Know
Critics Consensus
Finding the humanity in one of cinema's most iconic monsters, Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein is a lavish epic that gets its most invigorating volts from Jacob Elordi's standout performance.

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
Frankenstein is elaborate and expensive but also weirdly muted beneath its color-coded production design; like Nightmare Alley, it’s immaculate and bland.

Mashable
Guillermo del Toro delivers a moving masterpiece of horror and romance.

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
Mr. Del Toro tells the story from the point of view of each lead character, but that merely makes this shaggy film twice as long as it should be. Like this Creature, it’s a marvel to look at but dead inside.

Danielle Solzman
Solzy at the Movies
In many respects, Frankenstein is del Toro’s homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood, even as he reshapes Mary Shelley’s creation into something distinctly his own.
Rated: 3.5/5

Peter Gray
The AU Review
It’s haunting and beautiful, and seemingly more timely than ever as it talks of man and if his soul can ever be exonerated in the face of such repulsive actions.
Rated: 4/5
