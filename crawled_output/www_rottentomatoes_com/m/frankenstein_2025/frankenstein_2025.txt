What to Know
Critics Consensus
Finding the humanity in one of cinema's most iconic monsters, Guillermo Del Toro's Frankenstein is a lavish epic that gets its most invigorating volts from Jacob Elordi's standout performance.

The Ringer
Frankenstein is elaborate and expensive but also weirdly muted beneath its color-coded production design; like Nightmare Alley, it’s immaculate and bland.

Guillermo del Toro delivers a moving masterpiece of horror and romance.

Wall Street Journal
Mr. Del Toro tells the story from the point of view of each lead character, but that merely makes this shaggy film twice as long as it should be. Like this Creature, it’s a marvel to look at but dead inside.

Frankenstein is a visual masterpiece. Guillermo creates an amazing world for this story to live in, unfortunately the performances nor structure of the film keeps up with the amazing world that is created.
Rated: C

Solzy at the Movies
In many respects, Frankenstein is del Toro’s homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood, even as he reshapes Mary Shelley’s creation into something distinctly his own.
Rated: 3.5/5
