Stephen Romei
The Australian
This movie is a pleasure to watch. It is beautifully shot (cinematographer Ben Smithard) and gloriously costumed (costume designer Anna Robbins).
Rated: 3.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
With its mix of old characters and new, worldly upheaval and small-town drama, Fellowes illustrates what “Downton” has always done best, which is a social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven’t changed at all.
Rated: 3/4

I smiled, I laughed, and I maybe even wiped away a couple of tears, and that’s exactly as it should be.

Loyal audiences would watch this ensemble perform the phone book, and Fellowes gives them a good bit more to work with than The Yellow Pages.

Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.

They truly delivered on the world that is Downton, characters progressing in their arcs, and honoring Violet through it all. This was the perfect ending if there had to be one.

I really enjoy watching period piece movies and this one was pretty good.
They did a good job ending the very popular series with this movie finale.
It was done tastefully and the costumes were beautiful!
