This movie is a pleasure to watch. It is beautifully shot (cinematographer Ben Smithard) and gloriously costumed (costume designer Anna Robbins).
Rated: 3.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
With its mix of old characters and new, worldly upheaval and small-town drama, Fellowes illustrates what “Downton” has always done best, which is a social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven’t changed at all.
Rated: 3/4

I smiled, I laughed, and I maybe even wiped away a couple of tears, and that’s exactly as it should be.

Loyal audiences would watch this ensemble perform the phone book, and Fellowes gives them a good bit more to work with than The Yellow Pages.

Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.

The story line satisfactorily tied up everyone story. The use of songs from that era as background music added to the 1930's feel .
The mentions of Mama, were touching, not maudlin, but just appropriate to the dialog, as was the lovely portrait of her in the manor's foray.

Well acted and well written.
Many scenes were beautifully filmed.
I like how the Lady Mary character were able to see past characters that impacted the story.
