The Australian
This movie is a pleasure to watch. It is beautifully shot (cinematographer Ben Smithard) and gloriously costumed (costume designer Anna Robbins).
Rated: 3.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
With its mix of old characters and new, worldly upheaval and small-town drama, Fellowes illustrates what “Downton” has always done best, which is a social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven’t changed at all.
Rated: 3/4

I smiled, I laughed, and I maybe even wiped away a couple of tears, and that’s exactly as it should be.

Loyal audiences would watch this ensemble perform the phone book, and Fellowes gives them a good bit more to work with than The Yellow Pages.

Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.
