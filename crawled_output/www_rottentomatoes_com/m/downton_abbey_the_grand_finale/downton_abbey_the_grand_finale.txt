The Australian
This movie is a pleasure to watch. It is beautifully shot (cinematographer Ben Smithard) and gloriously costumed (costume designer Anna Robbins).
Rated: 3.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
With its mix of old characters and new, worldly upheaval and small-town drama, Fellowes illustrates what “Downton” has always done best, which is a social examination of how much things have changed and how they haven’t changed at all.
Rated: 3/4

I smiled, I laughed, and I maybe even wiped away a couple of tears, and that’s exactly as it should be.

Loyal audiences would watch this ensemble perform the phone book, and Fellowes gives them a good bit more to work with than The Yellow Pages.

Watching this lovely company of actors take their final bows as these beloved characters is a treat, whether the film is perfect or not. This is cinema as comfort food, a cozy blanket for trying times.

Loved this show ...especially the music!
Beautiful songs and great vocals.
I think they should follow up with Downton Abbey the Musical.
While the plot line was thin, the costumes and getting to see my favorite characters one more time made it worthy entertainment.

Good movie, tied up a few loose ends, but I would have preferred a 4-5 episode season instead of a two hour movie.
