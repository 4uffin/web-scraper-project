An expatriate French couple (Denis Ménochet and Marina Foïs) operate an organic farm in the Spanish countryside. However, their earnest enthusiasm reeks of patronizing privilege to the handful of "hill people" families who have toiled on the land for generations. Tensions between locals and foreigners boil over in this edge-of-your-seat thriller.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Rodrigo Sorogoyen throws us into rural Galicia with The Beasts, where tension and unease spread like wildfire in a scorching tale of decayed human nature.

New York Magazine/Vulture
Sorogoyen might give lip service to the economic realities underlying the land dispute, but he’s also not afraid to take sides and to entertain.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It becomes unbearably tense, really, really properly tense.

Impressive in its setting, positive outlook, and in its reference to character development. [Full review in Spanish]

Cinéfilo Serial
Rodrigo Sorogoyen once again demonstrates his talent behind the camera for crafting poignant stories, highlighting the oppressive and tense atmosphere and the development of highly engaging and ambiguous characters. [Full Review in Spanish]

William Stottor
FILMHOUNDS Magazine
The Beasts subverts expectations and, despite some scenes and plot points occasionally being too elongated, the overarching tangent of organicity and ferocity make this meaty, bruising thriller a must-watch.
Rated: 4/5

Spotlight on Film
The Beasts shows that enmity can be subtle and insidious...the film’s distinction resides in its painstaking exploration of a very human drama, a very vivid drama, a drama handled so sensitively and yet with such vigour.
Rated: 4.5/5

Well acted and effectively ratchets up tension throughout a long run time, but what feels like a huge payoff around a corner never really arrives. The ending is predictable and anticlimactic, caring more to make a point about human compassion and commitment, rather than payoff the thing they built up to for over two hours. Very mixed feelings on this one, but I still think it is worth a watch.

É um filme vendido como terror, mas é um terror psicológico e extremamente real. Com uma cadência lenta, sem monstros nem heróis de aço. Somente pessoas comuns com toda a maldade existente dentro de cada um. O fim pode não agradar a todos, mas eu gostei pois deixa o filme ainda quente em nossas memórias por um bom tempo.

Tough but realistic film. Mirrors the terribly true story of the Dutch Martin Verfondern https://archive.is/KHfGb. There is a documentary from 2016 called Santoalla to complete this watching to make it even more depressing.

At times, the movie has a tendency to openly state the themes clumsily but it's hard to deny the emotional effectiveness of the ending
