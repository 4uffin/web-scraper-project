Using actual footage from the event seamlessly mingled with new re-enactments, filmmaker James Marsh masterfully recreates high-wire daredevil Philippe Petit's 1974 stunt: performing acrobatics on a thin wire strung between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Plotting his feat like a master cat burglar, Petit enlists the help of a motley group of friends as he calculates every detail, from acquiring building access to stringing up the wire, and manages to pull off an astounding crime.

The tension builds incrementally, reaching almost unbearable heights at its dizzying climax.

It all makes for an absorbing, mischievously amusing yarn, whose climax unfolds with unexpected emotional force.

In this exhilarating, palm-moistening documentary by British filmmaker James Marsh (Wisconsin Death Trip), the twin towers are back to celebrate one of their finest moments.

From the Front Row
Reminds us that dreams can come true and men can fly, through the heights of the imagination and the triumph of the human spirit - this a film for all those who ever dared to dream.
Rated: 4/4

Leigh Paatsch
Herald Sun (Australia)
Some of the on-the-spot footage of the eccentric French thrillseeker's exploits truly boggle the mind (including a controversial stroll Petit once took across the Sydney Harbour Bridge).
Rated: 4/5

I was there when it happened.
I remember watching the news coverage on the little black-and-white TV in my bedroom.
Somewhat ironically, I was also in NYC the day the towers were destroyed in 2001: after three months in Europe I had just landed at JFK Airport about 36 hours before the attack.
This is just an incredible celebration of life. I have easily watched it 20 times and I cry like a baby during/after each screening at the utter joy it brings.

This is a breathtaking and poetic documentary that transcends its subject matter to become something deeply human, moving, and awe-inspiring. One of 2008's best movies.
