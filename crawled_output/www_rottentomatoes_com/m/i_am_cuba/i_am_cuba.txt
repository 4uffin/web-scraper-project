A study in contrasts set in and around Havana that explores Cuba's 1959 revolution. A young woman's fascination with the excess of an American-owned casino leads to her downfall in the eyes of her street vendor boyfriend. A tenant farmer revolts the only way he knows how, attacking the land he works. University students gain first-hand knowledge of political upheaval. And, in the hills outside the city, the members of a poor peasant family are patriotically swept up into the burgeoning revolt.

Critics Consensus
Visually absorbing and formally audacious, I Am Cuba (Soy Cuba) opens a long-buried time capsule that has lost none of its captivating power.

I Am Cuba is a cinephile's wet dream, a collage of Herculean feats of technical wizardry that would be easy to dismiss if it wasn't so humane.

Some of the most exhilarating camera movements and most luscious black-and-white cinematography you'll ever see inhabit this singular, delirious 141-minute communist propaganda epic.

Politically nave maybe, but it works beautifully as straight cinema.

With Donald Trump set to return to power, I Am Cuba may be a difficult watch, especially for those unwilling to surrender their freedom to a self-proclaimed “strongman.”

One of the most extraordinary pieces of revolutionary propaganda ever produced, as vibrant and vital as anything the Soviets released during the silent era.

Though being an part of soviet propaganda undoubtedly, the film is so masterfully crafted and filmed it nevertheless brings a lot of thought and shows off the life of cubans of the period as it was probably never showed.

The three stars comprise an average of the five star cinematography, which is absolutely superb and the one star for content. It's woeful propaganda and only the first story has the power to transcend the transparently nonsense political message.
