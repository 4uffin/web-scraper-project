...You know how in marriage they say "for better or for worse"? I think, in terms of my life, I have entered the "for worse" part, and it happened so quietly I didn't even recognize it. Richard Linklater's Blue Moon tells the story of legendary lyricist Lorenz Hart bravely facing the future as his professional and private life unravel at the opening night party for his former partner's hit show Oklahoma! By the time this night is over, Hart will have confronted both a world that no longer values his talent and the seeming impossibility of love.

Critics Consensus
While not the flashiest Richard Linklater film, Blue Moon boasts a wonderful performance by Ethan Hawke as he embodies a man hanging on by a thread while the audience hangs on to every word said.

Hawke's performance is a clown show, making a mockery of a musical genius who was tragically overwhelmed by his worst impulses.

Mr. Hawke seems like the last actor you’d cast in this role, yet he delivers the performance of his career.

The Daily Beast
Linklater’s latest is a moving and multifaceted ode to a bygone era and an artist whose creativity and contradictions were equally titanic.

Richard Linklater has made many portraits of time. This is perhaps one of his most intimate and saddest. And Ethan Hawke, in one of the best performances of his career, accompanies him with a heartbreaking dedication. [Full review in Spanish]
