Critics Consensus
Tim Robinson expands his exquisitely painful cringe comedy style to feature length with seamless results in Friendship, a toxic bromance that'll make audiences laugh and wince in equal measure.

Audience Says
A laugh-out-loud bromance for the ages, Friendship is a cringe man hug from Tim Robinson that feels uncomfortably right.

The Nightly (AU)
Friendship approaches male friendship in an off-beat and cringe but very funny way.

Emotionally desolate, but hilarious.

Jonathan Romney
Financial Times
If Robinson didn’t so completely inhabit Craig’s awfulness — and if the film didn’t unmask so many supposedly well-balanced other characters as themselves irredeemable — Friendship would seem unutterably cruel.
Rated: 3/5

Mattie Lucas
From the Front Row
DeYoung and Robinson mine (the) social ineptitude for increasingly tense laughs, ruthlessly dissecting the social ritual of male bonding with vicious aplomb.
Rated: 3/4

Film Frenzy
Packed with amusing and offbeat interludes.

The Buffalo Hive
Tim Robinson got his start as a writer/performer on “Saturday Night Live.” Did none of those people warn him about all the flop films based on SNL characters? Friendship demonstrates that those who do not remember film history are condemned to repeat it.
Rated: 2

Like the show I Think You Should Leave, I think this movie is a breather. It will without a doubt take on more meaning upon several viewings. From the initial, however, you get alternative comedy at its finest from the maestro Tim Robinson and some of the most cringiest moments for comic relief. Worth the watch,

Thought it was going to be deadpan comedy.
Turned out to be just weird.
Laughed at a couple things, but cringed at most.
Maybe it was too deadpan for me.
