Critics Consensus
Tim Robinson expands his exquisitely painful cringe comedy style to feature length with seamless results in Friendship, a toxic bromance that'll make audiences laugh and wince in equal measure.

Audience Says
A laugh-out-loud bromance for the ages, Friendship is a cringe man hug from Tim Robinson that feels uncomfortably right.

Friendship approaches male friendship in an off-beat and cringe but very funny way.

Emotionally desolate, but hilarious.

Financial Times
If Robinson didn’t so completely inhabit Craig’s awfulness — and if the film didn’t unmask so many supposedly well-balanced other characters as themselves irredeemable — Friendship would seem unutterably cruel.
Rated: 3/5

It is full of genius details and accurate observations. “Friendship” is boldly conceived and brashly unlikable, and maybe not for the faint of heart.
Rated: B

...the cast is well-tuned, and the story manages to take steady steps toward the existential abyss without losing that caustic humor which, even in its exaggeration, touches on uncomfortable and very real social truths. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

Understands the fear of relationship impermanence, and the fork between revealing yourself or hiding, and how vulnerability breeds both revulsion and connection. And the complicated thing that remains even when a dynamic goes bad.

Like the show I Think You Should Leave, I think this movie is a breather. It will without a doubt take on more meaning upon several viewings. From the initial, however, you get alternative comedy at its finest from the maestro Tim Robinson and some of the most cringiest moments for comic relief. Worth the watch,

Thought it was going to be deadpan comedy.
Turned out to be just weird.
Laughed at a couple things, but cringed at most.
Maybe it was too deadpan for me.
