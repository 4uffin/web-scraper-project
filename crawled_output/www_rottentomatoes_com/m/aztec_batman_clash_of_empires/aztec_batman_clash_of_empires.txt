It's a work of pop culture, yes, but it's also a piece of cultural memory, reminding viewers of their roots and that stories need to be passed on.

As a huge comics fan, I went into *Aztec Batman: Clash of Empires* with cautious optimism, but honestly, I‚Äôm kinda burned out on these endless ‚Äúmultiverse Batman‚Äù projects. It feels less like fresh storytelling and more like DC digging deeper into the Bat-piggy bank. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthe character designs are gorgeous, the worldbuilding is creative, and I‚Äôll give full credit to the animators for making this alternate setting feel alive. The story, though? Pretty standard Batman fare, just dropped into a different cultural backdrop. It‚Äôs decent, but way too predictable, and I found myself zoning out more than once. Fun to look at, sure, but I‚Äôm still longing for animated stories in the mainstream DC universe again. **3 stars.**

Me encant√≥, si quieres pas√°rtela bien ve cu√°ntas veces quieras, lo que si es que me hubiera gustado m√°s interacciones en n√°huatl y no tanto en espa√±ol.
