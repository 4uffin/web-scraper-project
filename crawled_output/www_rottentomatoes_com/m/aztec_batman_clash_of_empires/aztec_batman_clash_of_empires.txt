John Serba
Decider
Aztec Batman: Clash of Empires is a one-time-only kind of watch, mostly for diehard Batman completists. It’s novel, more than a little overstuffed and occasionally enjoyable. If that sounds like faint praise, that’s because it is.

Elements of Madness
... hews too closely to its DC roots and doesn’t embrace the imagination of the culture from which it borrows enough to break free, thereby resulting in a film that fails to raise tension even as it uses the real trauma of the Aztec people as the basis ..
Rated: 2.5/5

It's a work of pop culture, yes, but it's also a piece of cultural memory, reminding viewers of their roots and that stories need to be passed on.
Rated: 4/5

No es el mejor Batman, pero es un orgullo que esté basado en las raíces y cultura de los mexicanos.

It is not one of the best versions of the character, and in terms of animation quality it is not that great. However, the historical references as well as the use of correct pre-Hispanic language and knowing how to fit the mantles of the DC heroes to the era, giving an appropriate role to each one is excellent research and adaptive script

La pelicula tiene una buena adaptación de la cultura azteca cabe rezaltar que la creación del batman antiguo fue muy bien generado pero lo que era muy poco fuera de todo era el 2 caras español, se espera que la segunda entrega sea con un ritmo un poco mas adaptado a los nuevos villanos y no ingresar varios villanos en una sola pelicula

Vi Batman Azteca con la intención de incomodar a ciertos españoles que aún creen que su conquista no dejó estragos en México. La reinterpretación de los personajes me pareció interesante y el arte tiene un estilo distintivo; los fondos son realmente bellos. Sin embargo, la historia avanza demasiado rápido, lo que le resta profundidad. Como detalle adicional, algunas transiciones entre escenas resultan algo extrañas, aunque no llegan a arruinar la experiencia.
