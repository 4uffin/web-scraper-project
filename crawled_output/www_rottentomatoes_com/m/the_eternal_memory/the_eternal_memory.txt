Augusto and Paulina have been together and in love for 25 years. Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and his wife has since become his caretaker. As one of Chile's most prominent cultural commentators and television presenters, Augusto is no stranger to building an archive of memory, having been responsible for that herculean task following the Pinochet dictatorship and its systematic erasure of collective consciousness. Now he turns that work to his own life, trying to hold on to his identity with the help of his beloved. Day by day, the couple face this challenge head-on, adapting to the disruptions brought on by the taxing disease while relying on the tender affection and sense of humor shared between them that remains intact.

The love story of these two, and the way Pauli makes her way through extraordinarily difficult moments in which he is upset or frightened, feels surprising over and over.

Observer (UK)
A restrained, respectful piece of film-making that takes its lead from its two subjects.

Instructive on cognitive decline, but overall too slight to hit home.

Loud and Clear Reviews
The Eternal Memory is unquestionably moving, and it fulfils its purpose of presenting Alzheimer’s Disease upfront. [...] Yet, by not adequately explaining who this man is, and offering greater context to his suffering, the effort falls short.
Rated: 3/5

There's a valid and tender love story here... but it takes the easy way, as while focusing on it, it takes away from questioning the discourse of the lost memory of Chile. [Full review in Spanish]

The Herald (Scotland)
Every flashback to their well-documented previous lives is a heartbreaker, and as time goes on the picture becomes bleaker still. But what shines through is love, and laughter. Lots and lots of laughter.

Excellent representation of a drama that many people have to go through with their elders. Pain and anguish are reflected in both of them. Maite did it again!

This observative documentary seems to minimally capture the growing signs of dementia and the struggles that come with it, emphasizing the importance of cherishing lasting memories as sympathetically nuanced buildup after respectfully displaying the persons' profiles. (B)
