Luna and Lopez are great, but this is Tonatiuh's movie -- he takes a role that could easily be a caricature of queer flamboyance and pathos, and grounds it with depth and soul.

Slant Magazine
The musical is lesser Kander and Ebb, to be sure, but it still contains a critique—of the use of art as a form of escapism—that’s barely visible in this adaptation.
Rated: 2/4

Some people will have a very personal response to “Spider Woman” that will smother any criticisms about its lack of visual language, but that doesn’t mean this musical couldn’t have been better.

Kiss of The Spider Woman” is a marvelously crafted, vibrant technicolor gilded age homage and mostly entertaining thanks to well executed direction and a powerhouse performance from Tonatiuh...our favorite movies just may be what can save us all.
Rated: 3.5/5

Age of the Geek
Jennifer Lopez, her dancing and dresses are the starsin director Bill Condon's beautiful adaptation of Kander and Ebb's Broadway musical. Tonatiuh chemistry with Diego Luna and Lopez makes this sizzle. The musical is more timely than it should be.
Rated: 4/5

This new Spider-Woman isn't afraid of visual excesses or theatrical artifice. Quite the contrary: it embraces them as aesthetics and as ideological statements. [Full review in Spanish]
