HIM
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Fumbling the ball well before the red zone, HIM has style to spare but botches its promising conceit with rookie execution.

Meagan Navarro
Bloody Disgusting
Despite a stellar cast and a strong concept executed with vibrant style, HIM fumbles in integrating its visceral symbolism with horror and storytelling
Rated: 2.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
As a purely sensorial experience of sound and image, it‚Äôs sensational. As a searing examination of the body horrors of football, fandom and fame, it‚Äôs weak.
Rated: 2.5/4

David Fear
Rolling Stone
HIM ultimately takes all of these elements and throws them rapidly downfield at what feels like the most unfocused attempt at a socially resonant, allegory-heavy genre movie in ages.

Keith Garlington
Keith & the Movies
The movie‚Äôs unflinching vision and ferocious sense of style makes its allegory-soaked deconstruction of football culture hard to turn away from, even if it never reaches the heights of its ambition.

2.5/5

HIM is largely carried by its lead performers and enough of a stylish delivery to carry viewers through the more confusing narrative choices.

A Peele-wannabe flick with little on its mind and nothing in its soul. Truly fumbles the ball at every play.

Love it! In true Jordan Peele fashion, full of symbolism and social commentary. Intense, horrific and ironic at the same time. Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!
