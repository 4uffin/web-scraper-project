HIM
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Fumbling the ball well before the red zone, HIM has style to spare but botches its promising conceit with rookie execution.

Coleman Spilde

In Withers, “HIM” finds a star more than capable of holding a just-fine movie on his rippling shoulders, making it look better by association. He’s a joy to watch, charming and appropriately intense when the material calls for it.

Bob Mondello
NPR
The director's filming regimen includes x-ray-enhanced tackles, a lot of red lighting and some football-helmeted religious imagery. It all gets pretty tiresome after a while.

Stephanie Zacharek
TIME Magazine
It’s the kind of movie that leaves you feeling indifferent rather than chilled to the bone, clobbered into numbness with good intentions.

The AU Review
It’s gloriously twisted and it owns its broad personality.
It also has a duo of committed star turns at its core in Withers and Wayans.
Rated: 4/5

Morbidly Beautiful
With surreal visuals, disturbing body horror, and a powerhouse performance from Marlon Wayans, Justin Tipping’s Him challenges genre expectations and reveals the hidden horrors of ambition and sacrifice.
Rated: 3.5/5

I'm a big fan of the unexplained and HIM fully embraces that. I loved seeing Marlon Wayans eating up the scenery in every scene. I was wildly entertained despite the constant questions, confusion and general strangeness from the narrative and direction.

Its not trash like people say, but the narrative for this felt wholly unnecessary and overblown
S/O Marlon, big ups to the cinematography which was amazing, but boy was this story heavy handed for absolutely no reason.

The acting is good, the story itself isnt bad. But the religious imagery is so in your face it was honestly distracting.
