What to Know
Critics Consensus
Fumbling the ball well before the red zone, HIM has style to spare but botches its promising conceit with rookie execution.

Meagan Navarro
Bloody Disgusting
Despite a stellar cast and a strong concept executed with vibrant style, HIM fumbles in integrating its visceral symbolism with horror and storytelling
Rated: 2.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
As a purely sensorial experience of sound and image, it’s sensational. As a searing examination of the body horrors of football, fandom and fame, it’s weak.
Rated: 2.5/4

Rolling Stone
HIM ultimately takes all of these elements and throws them rapidly downfield at what feels like the most unfocused attempt at a socially resonant, allegory-heavy genre movie in ages.

It appears Jordan Peele may have let the other producers do most of the heavy producing lifting (if there is such a thing), because Peele’s signature touches of nuanced storytelling have been gorily savaged, not unlike the characters in the film.

Full of intriguing images and ideas that don't add up to much.

Third Coast Review
But the film doesn’t give us something that thoughtful or coherent; it’s vapid, flaccid, and confused—the screenplay is concussed in many ways.
Rated: 1.5/4

Absolutely TERRIBLE. I know Jordan Peele didn’t write this, but I’m shocked as hell that he signed on to produce this garbage.

Decent movie, wasn’t great and wasn’t terrible either. I’d give a shot, but there’s enough in the first watch that really doesn’t require a second viewing to reveal more. It’s the most superficial of the bunch and it’s not a bad thing either. I’m glad I seen it for myself and not listen to the critics. 3 or 3.5 out of 5 for sure.

This was not a scary movie but it was psychologically thrilling. It was beautifully shot, the acting was outstanding, and it made you feel what the lead actors were feeling. I would say this is definitely a good watch. How far are you willing to go for your passion?
