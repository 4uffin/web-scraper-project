What to Know
Critics Consensus
Fumbling the ball well before the red zone, HIM has style to spare but botches its promising conceit with rookie execution.

Meagan Navarro
Bloody Disgusting
Despite a stellar cast and a strong concept executed with vibrant style, HIM fumbles in integrating its visceral symbolism with horror and storytelling
Rated: 2.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
As a purely sensorial experience of sound and image, it’s sensational. As a searing examination of the body horrors of football, fandom and fame, it’s weak.
Rated: 2.5/4

Rolling Stone
HIM ultimately takes all of these elements and throws them rapidly downfield at what feels like the most unfocused attempt at a socially resonant, allegory-heavy genre movie in ages.

The MacGuffin
It has a lot of bravado, and it flexes its cinematic muscles all over the screen, but when we look underneath the veneer, we don’t find much bubbling inside.
Rated: C-

Robert Denerstein
Denerstein Unleashed
The movie's problem is embedded in its exaggerated approach and flashy flirtations with horror tropes as it tries it to be comically parodic and serious at the same time.

Great to see Marlon Waynes in a different light.
Typical Jordan Peele film, makes you think, deep meaning for certain things but he did his thing. Not bad. Need to see one more time to try and process everything.

At some points, it felt rushed. It also felt like there was more to the story, the ending felt very abrupt. Like “here’s all the commentary I have…okay bye.”
For some reason, I thought it would be scarier, for lack of a better word. Marlon Wayans was stellar, acting wise. And lots of acting potential from the other cast members. I’d probably watch it again once it’s available for free on a streaming site if I’m bored or wanna give it a fresh look on a random weekday. But I don’t think I’d paid for another ticket.

Gorgeous film. Peele on his game as always. The visuals were stunning, the story was gripping and the twists and turns punched all just as hard one after the other. This film will have you on the edge of your seat, breath held with anticipation! The sound track was awesome, as always, too. Football. Family. God. and don’t forget to have your eyes “peele-d” for all that hidden imagery and symbolism :)
