HIM
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Fumbling the ball well before the red zone, HIM has style to spare but botches its promising conceit with rookie execution.

Meagan Navarro
Bloody Disgusting
Despite a stellar cast and a strong concept executed with vibrant style, HIM fumbles in integrating its visceral symbolism with horror and storytelling
Rated: 2.5/5

Katie Walsh
Tribune News Service
As a purely sensorial experience of sound and image, it‚Äôs sensational. As a searing examination of the body horrors of football, fandom and fame, it‚Äôs weak.
Rated: 2.5/4

Rolling Stone
HIM ultimately takes all of these elements and throws them rapidly downfield at what feels like the most unfocused attempt at a socially resonant, allegory-heavy genre movie in ages.

The MacGuffin
It has a lot of bravado, and it flexes its cinematic muscles all over the screen, but when we look underneath the veneer, we don‚Äôt find much bubbling inside.

Great acting and well-crafted, stays entertaining throughout and doesnt overstay its welcome with about an hour-and-a-half run time.

Horrible! There‚Äôs was no story. They tried so hard to be deep and scary that it became weird and a waste of time and money.
