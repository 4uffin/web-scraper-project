Critics Consensus
Roma finds writer-director Alfonso Cuarón in complete, enthralling command of his visual craft - and telling the most powerfully personal story of his career.

Roma will be studied for years as a landmark in cinematic storytelling, made even more meaningful because it pays tribute to a character who is usually in the background.

Chicago Reader
In Cuarón's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before.

Aparicio, in her acting debut, is remarkable.

Cinapse
Despite having lived them in some fashion once before, Cuarón feels like he’s exploring these moments as earnestly as his audience — and in doing so unearths how uniting those moments of chaotic change can be.

The cinematography, sound design, and editing is as elegant as you’d expect from Cuarón. Not enough good things can be said about Yalitza Aparicio and her performance too, a stunning performance for a non-professional.

Roma is a riveting, gut-wrenching, and utterly absorbing experience that completely floored me.

Rewatched it for the second time and liked it a whole lot more than how I remembered it when it first came out.
This is the most visually stunning black and white film I have ever seen.
The cinematography was top notch.
It is a semi-biopic which makes it much more authentic and genuine.
Some scenes are just bizarre but in a good comedic sort of way, which helps balance the unfortunate events surrounding the main protagonist Cleo.
Fantastic movie and the Oscars are well deserved.

This movie was so incredibly boring. It was like watching paint dry but worse because we had to watch someone sweep a driveway for what felt like 15 minutes.

Intense! Pushing all kinds of emotions.
Unusual! Nothing you have ever seen before. Amazing! The movie unfolds more and more in time and keeps on giving. Rich! Touching on a multiverse of human issues. Contradictions! Partly over the top (but what movie isn't?) Unfortunately! The camerawork is omnipresent and may pull you back to your own sofa from time to time.

Beautifully staged on the 70s Mexico, "Roma" stands as a real life tale of love, friendship and nostalgia. Alfonso Cuaron isn't just telling a story: he's describing life itself through impressive cinematic sequences.

This movie is inherently a Latin American story, where the class dynamics allow the case of a house keeper being the heart of an upper class family but yet replaceable. It’s a story of perception, points of view on a highly unequal reality. The cinematography is brilliant, b&w choice focus is on emotions and relations as the rich colours of Mexico doesn’t distract us from the emotions expressed in this movie.
It’s a must watch of Mexican cinema, a masterpiece of slow yet powerful message.

I can understand a lot of the hype surrounding the cinematography, acting and screenplay but don’t expect the average casual person to be as engrossed with this film as a critic or someone studying film. It’s a slow burner, and I can understand why people would question the hype. The film probably tried too hard in the end to shock and be gut-wrenching and I’m not sure if it actually was.
