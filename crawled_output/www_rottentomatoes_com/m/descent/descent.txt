What to Know
Critics Consensus
Deft direction and strong performances from its all-female cast guide The Descent, a riveting, claustrophobic horror film.

While I think we should question the authority of the ubiquitous male writer-director to shape horror productions, I think Marshall does a good job representing his female characters.

Marshall could very well be the Caravaggio of the B-movie.

Chicago Reader
This intermittently effective UK horror thriller carefully establishes the psychological relationships among the women, then squanders this calibrated and generally plausible setup with a series of crude, implausible, and scattershot horror effects.

The Screen
In Neil Marshall’s 2005 horror masterpiece, darkness emerges as a living organism. It shifts and lurks and claws its way into our nerves, under our skin, and eventually, inside our heads.

... a film stripped to bloody basics, a ferocious and taut exercise in action horror that recalls early James Cameron, with more gore and less sentimentality.

Film Inquiry
The Descent falls into a long line of horrors preying on the visceral fears of audiences, cleverly bringing these terrors to the surface in a film that is at times hard to watch and experience.

Michael A.
In the deepest part of the world, what waits for us is creepier and more horrifying than we could imagine. This film puts us through moments that don’t jump-scare us to death, but allows us to figure out what we’re hearing and seeing and when we do, it’s a big gasp of horror.

De las mejores peliculas de cuevas de terror que he visto no le pongo 5 estrellas porque no me gusto que traicionaran a la guia sexy de rojo:/ sinceramente de terror no es tanto pero del 1 al 10 le pondria un 7 porque considero que apesar de que el suspenso es constante los demonios o canibales su apariencia no da tanto miedo comparando con otros asemejantes pero sin duda vale la pena verla aunque sino te gustan las peliculas de cuevas y que la escenografía es casi igual siempre mejor no la veas

One of those rare movies that builds characters just as well as it builds tension. The feeling of claustrophobia and building dread is palpable and the ending certainty doesn't sell itself out either. Superb stuff.

The Descent is a thrilling surprise from start to finish. The story builds with an engaging pace, drawing you into the characters’ development and early conflicts that carry both emotional weight and suspense. Hints of darker horror are sprinkled throughout, keeping you uneasy and anticipating what’s to come.
By the final act, the film completely shifts gears, plunging viewers into an intense, claustrophobic nightmare that leaves jaws dropped and hands gripping the seat. It’s a relentless ride, one that proves The Descent is not just another horror film, but a truly unforgettable experience.
