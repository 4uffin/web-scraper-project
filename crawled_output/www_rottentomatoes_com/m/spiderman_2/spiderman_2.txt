When a failed nuclear fusion experiment results in an explosion that kills his wife, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is transformed into Dr. Octopus, a cyborg with deadly metal tentacles. Doc Ock blames Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) for the accident and seeks revenge. Meanwhile, Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, faces fading powers and self-doubt. Complicating matters are his best friend's (James Franco) hatred for Spider-Man and his true love's (Kirsten Dunst) sudden engagement to another man.

Boasting an entertaining villain and deeper emotional focus, Spider-Man 2 is a nimble sequel that improves upon the original.

David Stratton
At the Movies (Australia)
Maybe it has something to do with Sam Raimi's skills as a director, or with Tobey Maguire's very human central performance, but the Spider-Man films are by far the best of the superhero genre.
Rated: 4/5

Anthony Quinn
Independent (UK)
A sequel that not only outstrips its predecessor but has a perversity and quick-wittedness that hardly seem to belong in a comic-book movie.

Independent on Sunday
Spider-Man 2 is better than just dark, it's touched by authentic teenage paranoia and neurosis.

Film Critic: Adrian Martin
While revelling in such subterranean themes, Raimi‚Äôs, offbeat, cartoonish sensibility is also simultaneously able to capture a certain innocence long gone from blockbuster movie entertainment.
Rated: 3.5/5

CinemaDebate
Rewatch SPIDER-MAN 2 (2004) for the studio's 100th anniversary.
Deeply earnest in its delivery, Sam Raimi perfectly portrays the central ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of Spider-Man. Truly one of the best in the genre.
Simply put, they just don‚Äôt make 'em like this anymore.
Rated: 5/5

Narratively lumpy as it sometimes is, "Spider-Man 2" marks Raimi‚Äôs return to the pure cinema of fun.
