Based on an unbelievable true story, Roofman follows Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), an Army veteran and struggling father who turns to robbing McDonald's restaurants by cutting holes in their roofs, earning him the nickname: Roofman. After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys "R" Us for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.

An incredibly tender love story develops at the heart of this American true-crime caper.
Rated: 5/5

Roofman is a frustrating watch, refusing to fit into the genre expectations. But that might be precisely the point.

Slant Magazine
The real Jeffrey Manchester may in fact have been polite, but Derek Cianfrance’s film doesn’t convince you that it needed to be as well.
Rated: 2/4

Chase Hutchinson
The Playlist
It’s a film that feints towards taking on more thorny, complicated questions about its character and the world he is living in, though it never follows through on fully engaging with them.
Rated: C

It may stumble from time to time narratively, but ultimately “Roofman” is a heartfelt showcase for Tatum and a light watch whose safe play and sticking to convention ends up serving as a compliment to its charm.

Roofman has changed my perception of Tatum and proven that he’s more than just comedic relief.
