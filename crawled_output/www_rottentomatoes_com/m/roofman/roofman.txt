Based on an unbelievable true story, Roofman follows Jeffrey Manchester (Channing Tatum), an Army veteran and struggling father who turns to robbing McDonald's restaurants by cutting holes in their roofs, earning him the nickname: Roofman. After escaping prison, he secretly lives inside a Toys "R" Us for six months, surviving undetected while planning his next move. But when he falls for Leigh (Kirsten Dunst), a divorced mom drawn to his undeniable charm, his double life begins to unravel, setting off a compelling and suspenseful game of cat and mouse as his past closes in.

Derek Cianfrance delivers a hugely empathetic, very entertaining depiction of an extraordinary life, featuring one of Channing Tatum’s best performances. Expect laughs, tears, and noughties nostalgia.

An incredibly tender love story develops at the heart of this American true-crime caper.

Roofman is a frustrating watch, refusing to fit into the genre expectations. But that might be precisely the point.

Gives star Channing Tatum a chance to showcase some dramatic weight, delivering one of the best performances of his career as a man making all the wrong choices for mostly the right reasons, helping to add dimension to a surprisingly fantastic film.
Rated: A-

Channing Tatum gives one of the best performances of the year. Roofman is as earnest, touching, funny and in the end sad films you'll see this year.
Rated: A

Chase Hutchinson
The Playlist
It’s a film that feints towards taking on more thorny, complicated questions about its character and the world he is living in, though it never follows through on fully engaging with them.
Rated: C
