On film, Hamilton feels every bit as fresh, invigorating, intoxicating, and revolutionary as it did when it premiered five years ago.

In a single song, Renee Elise Goldsberry shows off a range between Monica's vocals and Lauryn Hill's rhyme skills. Goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance I've seen all year.

The dramatic themes here are big and eternal, and the way history played them out gives them a powerful thump.
Rated: 5/5

I have rarely seen a recording of a stage musical capture the scale and electricity of a live performance, but “Hamilton” comes the closest.

All these ideas and issues are conveyed even more powerfully on film than watching it in a theater...

The phenomena that's been the topic of conversation for the past few years is a must watch. Friendly reminder on why Lin Manuel Miranda is a genius.

It clearly celebrates the writing of our constitution. The casting, dancing , singing and cohesiveness of telling this story are all 10+. How often does a production hit a 10in all categories.
