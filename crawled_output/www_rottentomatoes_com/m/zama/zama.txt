Zama
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zama offers a series of scathingly insightful observations about colonialism and class dynamics -- and satisfyingly ends a long wait between projects from writer-director Lucrecia Martel.

As an existential objet d'art Zama stands as a serious achievement. But that won't prevent even the most sophisticated of cinephiles from staggering out of the theater, wondering "What in the world did I just see?"

This blackly funny-and ultimately haunting-examination of colonial history is thoroughly characteristic in its brilliant manipulation of physical space.

If cinema is about being transported to another place, Martel is unrivaled as a guide...

I must give Martel credit for her firmness in sticking to the story. But there wasn't enough visually or thematically here in a film that focuses on a man who is…just waiting.
Rated: D-

Given my previous description of Lucrecia Martel, it will likely not surprise you that Zama is not for everyone. It is slow moving, difficult, and takes some real work to access as a viewer. That said, it is also a wonderful film...

Zama demonstrates Lucrecia Martel's intelligence in surgically designing scenes and capturing her particular vision of the story. [Full review in Spanish]

A masterpiece for fans of Tarkovsky and Albert Camus; a test for those who like fast-paced cinema.

Ambitious project that took a different look on the drag of colonialism on the "elite".
Ultimately, it took it too far and tried too hard to make something unique.
Props for trying.
I only saw it since it was on the NYT 1000 movies list.
SLC DVD.

Totally loved this Lucrecia Martel film. A fascinating take
on period cinema. surreal, strange, with an indelible ending.

As much as the titular character suffers, Martel doesn't turn him into a tragic figure nor do his torments overshadow the very real horrors of late 18th century colonialism. Its an impressive feat, one that's matched by the haunting and enigmatic ending.

Having seen this film in the cinema several years ago, I was delighted to find it on Mubi and have a second chance to see it. A film which enchanted nearly all critics and sharply divided audiences has left me still decidedly on the side of the critics.
The action of the film has a dream-like quality and is seen through the eyes of Don Diego de Zama, a magistrate
in Spain's eighteenth century colonial empire, whose utter downfall we witness. The period milieu is convincingly realised as the camera pans slowly over the dim interiors, the sun-drenched landscapes and seascapes and the inhabitants, both European and native.While some have criticised the film's slowness, I found the strangeness of everything compellingly hypnotic.

ZAMA is an interesting character study of a man seemingly lost in limbo, while the initial story seems as if it will expand, it instead narrows and plods along to an uncertain and unexpected end. Solid acting, but the pacing definitely leaves something to be desired. A good film for fans of peculiar survival stories, such as the Vincent Cassel film about Gauguin in French Polynesia.
