Together
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Given an extra sinew of authenticity by the metatextual casting of Alison Brie and Dave Franco at the top of their game, Together is a body horror that's as emotionally sticky as it is memorably gnarly.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Surging with chemistry from the leads, Together fuses the bizarre with the perturbed, crafting its own sort of alchemy that feels wholly original.

Nicolas Rapold
Sight & Sound
The metaphor of attachment finally isn’t just about visualising co-dependence; what gets under your skin is Tim and Millie’s fear that they’re forgetting how to be close at all.

Mashable
Because of all the Sundance buzz, even as I watched Together's supremely gruesome climax, I was a bit bereft, hungering for something more.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
The beauty of the film and of the screenplay from... writer-director Michael Shanks is that it’s an unforgiving dissection of co-dependent romantic relationships as well as a giddy and frequently stomach-churning scream-at-the-screen body horror.
Rated: 4/5

Leandro Ariel Porcelli
Cinéfilo Serial
The real life chemistry of it's charismatic double leads embolden an already solid horror movie script into a body horror drama about the nightmares of falling in love. It aims high and manages to be a pretty unique little gem. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

Together: confirms that the [horror] genre is still alive, that it can still unsettle, disturb, and fascinate without the need for tired formulas.

The Treatment (Substack)
Not only is its attitude towards codependency markedly impressive in scope and incision, but it also nods to the thematic baggage found across the horror genre, thereby highlighting the horror genre’s codependency with its own ideological history.

I love that body horror is being explored in current horror films, I just don’t know that this movie was my favorite example. The “humor” struck me as very strange and out of place - I would have enjoyed if the dark aspects of what was happening would have kept that mood.
