One Battle After Another is rife with big ideas, but it’s never didactic; it’s too committed to emotionally investing the audience.

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
It’s not a perfect film, but set aside some of its problems and just surrender to cluster after cluster of technically inspired, seamlessly executed sequences that will take your breath away and give you goosebumps. They’re that good.
Rated: 3.5/4

TIME Magazine
One Battle After Another is of the moment without hammering away at us with its ideas; its seriousness is the unserious kind, which makes it even more potent, in a Dr. Strangelove sort of way.

Committed DiCaprio, Penn, Teyana Taylor and Del Toro battle freedom and fear in Paul Thomas Anderson’s riveting revolutionary rescue thriller relevant now.

Toisto.net
Paul Thomas Anderson's latest is a film fiercely dedicated to not taking a stance. It makes fun of everyone, which means it ultimately says nothing.
Rated: 2/5

Jack King
GQ Magazine [UK]
Sean Penn channels Charlie Chaplin into a career-best parody of action man machismo. (He immediately joins Daniel Day-Lewis, Tom Cruise and Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the canon of Great PTA Performances.)
