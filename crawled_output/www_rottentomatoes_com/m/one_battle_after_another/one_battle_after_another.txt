David Sexton
New Statesman
A film serious about racial politics... There’s almost none of this primal subject in Pynchon’s novel, yet it’s Anderson’s main theme. He’s a director whose films always come at you from a different angle. Don’t miss this one.

Jake Wilson
Sydney Morning Herald
Indeed, as social commentary the film is largely toothless...Still, as a stylist Anderson hasn’t lost his audacity: there’s more cinematic invention here than in most other mainstream releases this year put together.
Rated: 3.5/5

Danny Leigh
Financial Times
Movies of nearly three hours don’t usually come with such sustained tick-tock grip. You risk palpitations, but the filmmaking is seamless. The whole picture shares the same dual identity — delirious and deadly serious.
Rated: 5/5

Brian Eggert
Deep Focus Review
With a sprawling runtime and terrific ensemble cast, One Battle After Another feels at once epic and personal in Anderson’s portrait of America’s inward-facing bitterness and the accompanying human toll.
Rated: 4/4

Prabhjot Bains
RANGE Magazine
Spanning a breezy near-three-hour runtime, One Battle After Another erupts as a political powderkeg of an epic—enthralling, hilarious, and steeped in revolutionary verve for a world that desperately needs it.

Chris Wasser
Sunday Independent (Ireland)
It’s a strange film, comical and chaotic – and the sudden tonal shifts (a half-drawn culture war satire one minute; a goofy stoner venture the next) might test your patience.
Rated: 4/5
