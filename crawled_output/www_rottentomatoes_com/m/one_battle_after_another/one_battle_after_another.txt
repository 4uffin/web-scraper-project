Wenlei Ma
The Nightly (AU)
It’s not just that it is superbly crafted on every level, it is also properly entertaining. It has a momentum that propels everything forward always, and never wavers in capturing and holding your attention.
Rated: 5/5

Barry Hertz
Globe and Mail
Hollywood’s most contradictory creation in ages: a crowd-pleasing political manifesto, a riotous action-comedy of ideas, a movie constructed for the eye as much as the heart and mind. Now that’s revolutionary.

One Battle After Another is rife with big ideas, but it’s never didactic; it’s too committed to emotionally investing the audience.

The Jam Report
It's bravura filmmaking at its most alive, where every frame feels electrified, every choice deliberate, every moment vibrating with purpose.
Rated: 5/5

EJ Moreno
Flickering Myth
A near-flawless masterwork that's somehow a political nightmare, a father/daughter epic, and Leonardo DiCaprio having the most fun in years. This is the film we need right now.

FILMINK (Australia)
… a confronting and hardened thrill ride through the nightmare of modern America.
