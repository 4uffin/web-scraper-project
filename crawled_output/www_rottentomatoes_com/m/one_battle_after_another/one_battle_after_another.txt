Critics Consensus
An epic screwball adventure teeming with awe-inspiring action set pieces, One Battle After Another is Paul Thomas Anderson's most entertaining film yet while also one of his most thematically rich.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another” is an exciting, goofy and deadly serious big-screen no — a no to complacency, to oppression, to tyranny.

Washington Post
... a hellacious action movie, asuspense thriller and various other genres the director makes up as he goes along, replete with a hapless hero, a warrior princess and the damnedest villain the movies have seen in a very long time.
Rated: 4/4

Austin Chronicle
Anderson still directs with purpose, and while One Battle After Another is never as coherent as it is exciting, it avoids the tag of being lesser Anderson.
Rated: 3.5/5

Seattle Film Blog
One Battle After Another, [PT Anderson's] 10th feature, doesn't recreate Reagan's America, but rather Trump's America, and everything about it feels up to the minute, because one directly leads to the other.
Rated: 4/4

Denerstein Unleashed
Wild and scattered, One Battle After Another takes a big dare. It's like a dinner brimming with side dishes and no main course. Don't take that as a failure but as an overriding observation about the incoherence of a time without a clear center.

On the whole, One Battle After Another is a daunting and captivating affair, which should be watched on the big screen.

Joseph Andropolis
Although I was unsure but realized I wasn’t lost in what was going on in the movie but The opening scenes where more of an unsettling blur of incident without much context. Anderson leaves it to us to ride the roiling wave he creates.
The characters will become more defined when the film leaps ahead 16 years. Still active, the revolution seems to be sputtering.
Time remains fuzzy throughout. Characters use cell phones, but pay phones still can be found in the story's dystopian surroundings. The movie overall was astounding. Leonardo Di Carpio, Teyana Taylor, Sean Penn, Regina Hall, Chase Infinit (Willa), and so many more actors did such a stellar job. I will be going to see this again. Amazing work!!
