One Battle After Another is rife with big ideas, but it’s never didactic; it’s too committed to emotionally investing the audience.

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
It’s not a perfect film, but set aside some of its problems and just surrender to cluster after cluster of technically inspired, seamlessly executed sequences that will take your breath away and give you goosebumps. They’re that good.
Rated: 3.5/4

TIME Magazine
One Battle After Another is of the moment without hammering away at us with its ideas; its seriousness is the unserious kind, which makes it even more potent, in a Dr. Strangelove sort of way.

Shade Studios
Paul Thomas Anderson’s comic satire is an American masterpiece and one of the best studio movies in years.
An instant classic.
Rated: 10/10

CNET
One Battle After Another is holding up a mirror to society, and the reflection feels bent and distorted, like something you'd see in a carnival funhouse.
That's what makes the movie terrifying; that's what makes it terrific.
Rated: A+

Paul Klein
FILMHOUNDS Magazine
This might be one of the year's most important films: a call to arms, that has the strength of its convictions to be very funny but also shockingly pointed in its assessment of where America is at the current time.
Rated: 4/5
