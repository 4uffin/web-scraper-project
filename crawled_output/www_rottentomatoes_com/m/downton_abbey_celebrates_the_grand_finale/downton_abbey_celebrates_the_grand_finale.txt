The best of the three Downton films. It is the most like the TV series. Everybody gets to shine. Well done on all levels. Glad that they used the music from the series. Wonderful! Must-see movies!

I was really hoping to enjoy this, so sadly, I must report that I really didn't. Taking a TV Series to the big screen is a task that can go either way; stay in the TV Land or making a splash on the big screen.
This should have remained in TV Land. It was slow and non-eventful, which made it difficult to not get bored. I found myself wanting to watch it in episodes but could't find a pause/off button.
Wasn't crazy about the cinematography as it was poorly lit in many scenes. I really felt the absence of Maggie Smith's character as well. She would have given it the interest and spice this movie needed so desperately.
She's sorely missed. 💔

Back to Downton Abbey , such a great journey one last time. Watching some of the most believed characters say goodbye was bitter sweet to say the least! What a terrific movie , just as I expected the finale to be honestly ! Not a moment was spent in regret at all ! Well done writers, cast & crew. Such a terrific series & movies as well! So very pleasurable! I highly recommend if you love the series and movies
