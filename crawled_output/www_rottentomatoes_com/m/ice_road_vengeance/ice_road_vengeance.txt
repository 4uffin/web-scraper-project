Clint Worthington

For being an ostensible sequel, “Ice Road: Vengeance” features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh’s follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker’s dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film’s existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that’s you, you’re in for a great weekend at the movies.

...a woefully erratic actioner that squanders its assortment of positive attributes.

…defies common sense or credulity...the people of Nepal deserve something better than barely appearing in a film set in their own country, and tough-watch Ice Road: Vengeance’s complete lack of ice roads makes it one for the trades descriptions act….

Neeson is on automatic pilot as the stern-faced saviour we've seen him play so many times before in less forgettable or by-the-book action films than this.

I couldn’t believe how cheaply made and unrealistic it was for a Neeson movie. The only good part of the movie was Liam neeson.

It's hard to top some of the other negative reviews, or come up with anything new to say about how bad this movie is.
I think it's time for Neeson to hang up his action movie persona and call it a day.
He also just looks bad--is he ill or just old.

It’s pretty hard to watch..
the story line seems to be written by either AI or a 7 year old .
Acting was pretty rough as well. People keep doing things that make zero sense.
Bad cgi with the explosions and gun shots and action scenes were horrible
This must be a product of the writers strike.

One of the worst movies I have ever watched.
CGI has really ruined movies; worse the bad CGI on this movie. Couldn’t finish watching it.

Where do we start. Worst acting including Liam. Seems like AI doing his acting. Nepalese accent sounds Arab. The terrain is anything but Katmandu.
Fight scenes that should have been the hallmark of this movie looked B-grade with equally bad graphics.
Suggest to avoid it like the plague
