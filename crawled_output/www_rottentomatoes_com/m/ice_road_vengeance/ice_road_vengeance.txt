For being an ostensible sequel, “Ice Road: Vengeance” features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh’s follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker’s dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film’s existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that’s you, you’re in for a great weekend at the movies.
Rated: C

Neeson is on automatic pilot as the stern-faced saviour we've seen him play so many times before in less forgettable or by-the-book action films than this.
Rated: 2/5

Ice Road: Vengeance is soooo great. What an amazing movie. It should win some Oscars. That’s Irish sarcasm.

The Times of India
The script is thin, the performances hover around average, and the CGI often looks unfinished. Yet, there’s a simplicity to it that works in spurts.

Tearing up the ice road once more... this time on a mountain and without much of an ice road!
It is slower to develop than the predecessor and the motives and stakes of the journey on the road are less ingrained in the central plot.

Oh. My. God.
This movie.....
The frickin' worst EVER.
Terrible. Terrible. Simply, effing terrible.
Liam Neeson and his merry mob of Muppets were so inept I started cheering for the bad guys.

First of all, no one can say to me if I will or will not like a movie! Critics are the foremost idiots!!!
Anyway, I for one, enjoyed the movie. There were ‘spots’ in the movie where one would have to suspend one’s belief (Liam at 72 years old jumping onto a movie cargo, and the young girl named Star able to ‘master’ a few martial arts moves). However, I really loved Fan Bing Bing’s character in the movie. She was absolutely believable in all of the fight scenes and shooting scenes. And she doesn’t need the heavy makeup that she usually wears in public. To me, she was very beautiful with hardly any makeup on at all. Liam did a good job as usual,
and I think one should watch it and let not someone else tell you otherwise.
