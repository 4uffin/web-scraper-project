For being an ostensible sequel, ‚ÄúIce Road: Vengeance‚Äù features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh‚Äôs follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker‚Äôs dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film‚Äôs existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre in for a great weekend at the movies.

Neeson is on automatic pilot as the stern-faced saviour we've seen him play so many times before in less forgettable or by-the-book action films than this.

Ice Road: Vengeance is soooo great. What an amazing movie. It should win some Oscars. That‚Äôs Irish sarcasm.

The script is thin, the performances hover around average, and the CGI often looks unfinished. Yet, there‚Äôs a simplicity to it that works in spurts.

This movie is complete bullshit. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
I‚Äôm reviewing for the first time because I don‚Äôt want others to feel the same disappointment.
üõë 70% green screen and AI
üõë C-grade action with zero realism
üõë Nepali characters speak Hindi with weird Chinese/Indian accents
üõë No idea how Nepal actually works ‚Äì Nepal Police doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúcaptains‚Äù or ‚Äúlieutenants‚Äù!
It‚Äôs clear the actor and director did no research. Beautiful location, wasted potential.
1 star for Nepal. Sorry Liam neeson.
‚≠êÔ∏è / 5 ‚Äì Watch literally anything else.

I really enjoyed seeing the old Partridge Family bus again in this Liam Neeson comedy but really missed seeing Danny Partridge.
It was a comedy, right???

BadNews R
Liam Neeson has built an entire late-career persona on stoic, gravel-voiced men caught in impossible situations, but at this point, the formula feels worn thin. Ice Road: Vengeance, the sequel to the 2021 Netflix hit The Ice Road, is yet another attempt to capture that gritty Neeson magic ‚Äî but instead, it proves just how repetitive and uninspired his recent filmography has become.
The original Ice Road wasn‚Äôt a critical darling by any stretch, yet it found an audience on streaming platforms, largely thanks to Neeson‚Äôs name recognition. This sequel, however, feels like it exists purely to capitalize on that fleeting popularity rather than to expand or improve upon the premise. Rather than tightening the narrative or digging deeper into its world, the story meanders. Instead of staying firmly anchored to Neeson‚Äôs character ‚Äî the very reason audiences tune in ‚Äî the film diverts attention to side characters and subplots that add little to the overall momentum. The result is a story that connects scene to scene but never gels into a compelling whole.
The direction here is especially frustrating. There are glimpses of what could have been a tense, stripped-down survival thriller, but those moments are buried under flat pacing, uninspired action sequences, and dialogue that feels like it was lifted from a dozen other forgettable B-movies. The screenplay squanders its opportunities ‚Äî rather than raising the stakes or giving Neeson‚Äôs character new dimensions, it leans on recycled beats we‚Äôve seen countless times before.
And yet, it‚Äôs worth noting that Neeson himself isn‚Äôt the problem. His presence is as commanding as ever, and it‚Äôs easy to imagine a version of this story that could‚Äôve made better use of his gravitas. It‚Äôs also a reminder of his range when you think back to how much fun he was in The Naked Gun, showing a comedic side that‚Äôs been buried under six years of grim, interchangeable thrillers. Unfortunately, Ice Road: Vengeance offers him nothing fresh to work with ‚Äî he‚Äôs simply going through the motions.
In the end, the film feels like a missed opportunity. There were multiple directions the sequel could have gone ‚Äî leaning into character study, embracing high-octane action, or even building suspense in the icy isolation ‚Äî but instead, it chose none of them. What we‚Äôre left with is a muddled, uninspired movie that will likely vanish from memory as quickly as it appeared.
Final Verdict:
Unless you‚Äôre a die-hard Liam Neeson completist, Ice Road: Vengeance is a pass. The story is scattered, the thrills are thin, and the execution never lives up to its premise.
