For being an ostensible sequel, ‚ÄúIce Road: Vengeance‚Äù features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh‚Äôs follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker‚Äôs dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film‚Äôs existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre in for a great weekend at the movies.
Rated: C

‚Ä¶defies common sense or credulity...the people of Nepal deserve something better than barely appearing in a film set in their own country, and tough-watch Ice Road: Vengeance‚Äôs complete lack of ice roads makes it one for the trades descriptions act‚Ä¶.
Rated: 2/5

Neeson is on automatic pilot as the stern-faced saviour we've seen him play so many times before in less forgettable or by-the-book action films than this.

Ice Road: Vengeance is soooo great. What an amazing movie. It should win some Oscars. That‚Äôs Irish sarcasm.

A travesty for the people of Nepal.
At least 72 people were killed and 2,100 were injured in protests in the last few weeks in Nepal, just days before Vengeance was released on Netflix. This movie is perhaps one of the most insensitive I have ever witnessed. Can you imagine the outrage if a movie about Native Americans was filmed in Mexico almost completely with Filipinos shortly after those same Native Americans were experiencing a deadly revolution?
I trekked to basecamp in 2018 and know the proud and desperately poor people of Nepal. And the beauty of the trail to basecamp (there is no road as depicted in the movie) is unlike anything else. Nepalese are special and incredibly different from the people of India which along with China work in a perverse contest to control the people of landlocked Nepal.
My guide and good friend from my trek is Gele. Like Gele, there are countless Nepalese who would benefit from the hiring of their countrymen to be in a movie such as Vengeance and from the outside world getting a glimpse of the amazing scenery and people of the real Nepal. This movie could have done that but rather chose to hire almost exclusively actors from their neighboring relatively rich India and use scenery from Australia which in no way depicts accurately the awe inspiring views of the true Himalayas.
Bottomline I like Liam Neeson and his movies, but this is a slap in the face to an entire country and their amazing people.

I created an account just to rate this movie because it was so bad.
It was infuriating.
The writing was terrible, the plot was terrible, the acting was terrible, the lines were terrible, the CGI was terrible, the action was terrible.
I‚Äôm not even convinced that was really Liam Neeson.
It almost seemed like they asked AI to create the most generic Liam Neeson movie ever and this is what it came up with.
THERE WERENT EVEN ANY ICE ROADS.
I don‚Äôt know how anyone involved in the production of this movie looked at the final product and said ‚Äúyeah guys, we killed it.
This is great‚Äù

This movie is complete bullshit. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
I‚Äôm reviewing for the first time because I don‚Äôt want others to feel the same disappointment.
üõë 70% green screen and AI
üõë C-grade action with zero realism
üõë Nepali characters speak Hindi with weird Chinese/Indian accents
üõë No idea how Nepal actually works ‚Äì Nepal Police doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúcaptains‚Äù or ‚Äúlieutenants‚Äù!
It‚Äôs clear the actor and director did no research. Beautiful location, wasted potential.
1 star for Nepal. Sorry Liam neeson.
‚≠êÔ∏è / 5 ‚Äì Watch literally anything else.
