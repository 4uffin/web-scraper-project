For being an ostensible sequel, “Ice Road: Vengeance” features zero ice roads. In fact, writer-director Jonathan Hensleigh’s follow-up barely stands apart from any of the other baker’s dozen punch-em-ups Neeson has led in the last decade.
Rated: 1.5/4

Destined to be quickly forgotten even by fans of its predecessor, Ice Road: Vengeance proves as generic as its title.

The film’s existence seems to rely on a bet that someone out there was dying to see a few more minutes of Gurty flashbacks. If that’s you, you’re in for a great weekend at the movies.

...a woefully erratic actioner that squanders its assortment of positive attributes.

…defies common sense or credulity...the people of Nepal deserve something better than barely appearing in a film set in their own country, and tough-watch Ice Road: Vengeance’s complete lack of ice roads makes it one for the trades descriptions act….
Rated: 2/5

Neeson is on automatic pilot as the stern-faced saviour we've seen him play so many times before in less forgettable or by-the-book action films than this.

One of the worst movies I have ever watched.
CGI has really ruined movies; worse the bad CGI on this movie. Couldn’t finish watching it.

Where do we start. Worst acting including Liam. Seems like AI doing his acting. Nepalese accent sounds Arab. The terrain is anything but Katmandu.
Fight scenes that should have been the hallmark of this movie looked B-grade with equally bad graphics.
Suggest to avoid it like the plague

I remember the first Ice Road being sub-par. I have no idea what inspired the sequel.
Utterly horrendous. Bad acting. Bad script. Bad CGI. Storyline is extremely stupid. Brother was in the army for 21+ years and is only a sergeant.
Everything about this movie is awful.

Fairly terrible. Poor acting and poor effects make it irritating to watch.

The psychiatrist is wearing a stethoscope.
That sets the pace for a totally unrealistic and fairly boring movie.
Everyone in Nepal speaks English quite well.
Signs are all in English also.
Maybe it wasn't really Nepal.
Bad guys are poor shooters.
Good guys perform miraculous repairs in minutes with old and broken technology.
Storyline is totally ordinary and predictable.
Liam Neeson failed to salvage a bad movie with less than average acting.
Save your time.

30-40 minutes in, I found this movie unfinishable. Just... don't. Don't even think about it.
