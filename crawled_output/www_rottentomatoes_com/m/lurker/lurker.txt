A screw-turning psychological thriller made for the moment, LURKER is the razor-sharp directorial debut from The Bear and Beef writer-producer Alex Russell. When twenty-something Los Angeles retail clerk and loner Matthew (Théodore Pellerin) encounters rising pop star Oliver (Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe), he takes the opportunity to edge his way into the in-crowd. But staying there isn't easy. With an entire entourage (Bottoms' Havana Rose Liu, Abbott Elementary's Zack Fox, Y2K's Daniel Zolghadri, mid90s' Sunny Suljic) vying for attention, Matthew must prove himself to Oliver as more than just a follower. As their bond grows strained and mainstream fame appears within reach, access and proximity become a matter of life and death. Online fixation meets reality in this parasocial, paranoid cat-and-mouse film driven by star-making performances. With an incisive view to contemporary culture and a brilliant score from Kenny Beats (known for his work with Vince Staples), LURKER presents an exhilarating take on the music industry, the blurred line between friend and fan, and our universal search for validation.

Lurker is an excellent showcase for the talents of Théodore Pellerin and an intriguing first step as a feature filmmaker for Alex Russell.

The American Dream of being seen curdled into a nightmarish hall of mirrors.

Lurker feels less like a narrative thriller and more like a chilling, genuine document of how easy it’s become to manipulate those around us in a hyper-digital world, where the mere proximity to celebrity can be as powerful as celebrity itself.

It's impossible to look away from the cringey and tension-filled situations surrounding Matthew, whose evolution unfolds in a crescendo of discomfort and menace that keeps the viewer hooked from start to finish. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5

with a strong ensemble cast and an unhinged story, Russell earned enough grace from the audience not to lose moviegoers in the final act.

The film’s cynicism is creepy, then moving and wickedly amusing.

Although compared to Saltbourne, it doesn't come close. Disjointed story line and character development.

This film is an interesting ride. It does a good job at making you feel you’re experiencing the events in real time. I do feel there were several unanswered questions & missed opportunities. Overall, the story lacked & didn’t fully land for me.
