Hinging on the nitpicking anxieties of the true crime genre, “Strange Harvest” maintains an air of abject horror, even if its penchant for ease nudges focus out of the way.
Rated: 2.5/4

The Daily Beast
“[Its] tale about a California serial killer with supernatural intentions is filtered through a persuasive verité lens that, however skin-deep, underscores the enduring effectiveness of its non-fiction devices."

It’s a grisly piece of work — drawing at least minor inspiration from the New French Extremity movement, of all places — but one that manages to display its cutthroat ambitions with surprising subtlety.
Rated: 3/4

It's not easy to pull of a convincing faux documentary, but this ingenious movie does it by blending an exceedingly intelligent screenplay with a firm grasp of documentary style.
Rated: 4/5

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
Strange Harvest is an ambitious work, gliding from procedural to something more cosmic, yet its inconsistent execution leaves something to be desired.

This is sort of an interesting watch. It starts out really promising but eventually feels redundant. I wouldn’t personally classify it as horror. It’s more of a drama/thriller.

Uncanny recreation of the true crime documentary format. It's accuracy in presentation was so true-to-form, the unsettling feeling didn't occur until after the post-credit scene.

Movie would’ve been better if they show more of the serial killer side. Instead of explaining the event from the cops perspective with talking. Kinda waste time of audience. The concept is great but waste in a way.

I had high hopes for this as it hits two of my favorite horror subgenres,
serial killer stories and documentary style films. This one fell flat, Lots of talking head sequences, "crime scene photos", found footage segments. Though well acted (for it's type of film), it was simply a rehash of other similarly type films. Nothing unusual happens, no real pay off. Wait for streaming if you must. It's a "meh" from me.

It was like if Se7en was done as a documentary. A bit of a slow burn, but good fun.
