Vagabond Harry (Danny Glover) pays an unexpected visit to his old chum Gideon (Paul Butler), who accepts the aimless man into his home, despite the fact that the household is already overcrowded. Hard-drinking yet charismatic, Harry both entertains and enrages Gideon and his wife, Suzie (Mary Alice). However, after Gideon falls gravely ill, Harry decides to step in and take his friend's place in the household. Unfortunately, his intentions are far from pure, and the consequences are tragic.

Like Harry at his eloquent best, To Sleep with Anger is a spellbinder.

A sophisticated and sweetly shivery ghost story.

Philadelphia Inquirer
Despite its subject matter and title, To Sleep With Anger has a sardonic, comic edge.
Rated: 3/4

Peter Keough
Boston Phoenix
Subtly structured, metaphorically elegant, shrewdly balanced, and richly performed, To Sleep with Anger is [Charles Burnett's] masterpiece.

Karl Bruce Knapper
Bay Area Reporter
Burnett has created a brilliant tapestry of a movie, intricately woven of multiple layers of truth and dishonesty, love and mistrust, folklore and history.

Marylynn Uricchio
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
Burnett skillfully weaves his various story lines and characters together until the cumulative effect is an absolutely microscopic look at the nature of family life.

Lesson of this movie: don't let Danny Glover into your house... or maybe do

What's ingenious here is how Glover is both a demonic and messianic figure, bringing long simmering family tensions to a boil . . . not to destroy the family but to save them.

Danny Glover is
Harry. He pays an unexpected visit to his old chum Gideon (Paul Butler), who accepts the aimless man into his home, despite the fact that the household is already overcrowded. Hard-drinking yet charismatic, Harry both entertains and enrages Gideon and his wife, Suzie. Gideon then falls gravely ill, Harry decides to step in and take his friend's place in the household. Unfortunately, his intentions are far from pure, and the consequences are tragic.
There's a lot of talk in here and I was quite bored. But I admire the movie having many relatable elements when it comes to this kind of family drama.

I first watched the movie when released in 1990, and watched again.
This movie is very layered and many references for African Americans - especially those of us that grew up in the south.
See it.

One of Danny Glover's best films as a drifter whose presence seems to expose the hearts of the people in the household as tensions arise between brothers, siblings, and parents, and culture change.
