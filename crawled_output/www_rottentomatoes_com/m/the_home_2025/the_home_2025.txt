...beyond DeMonaco’s willingness to go for broke with gore, this sense of not entirely knowing where we stand gives the climax of The Home what edge it has.

Variety
Davidson shows he may not have the chops to carry a horror film, while DeMonaco fails to deliver any thrills this time. Ultimately, it’s a by-the-numbers effort that proves quite disappointing.

Davidson is in over his head conveying any sense of suspense or danger, and the blood-soaked climax is plays like a live action video game fantasy come to life.

Fortunately there is an ecstatically hyperviolent climax, hitting hard like a raging storm, which will make even the most jaded horror fan feel young again.

A muddled story and a series of missteps leave The Home a frustrating mess.

Odd and unsettling yet overall underwhelming, The Home's fascinating characters, intriguing mystery, and brooding atmosphere sadly don't make it over the finish line.

This is a rocky one. It’s a good premise & had potential but it ultimately falls a little flat. Some parts are a little comical when they weren’t intended to be.
