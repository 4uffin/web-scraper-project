Sydney Morning Herald
...beyond DeMonacoâ€™s willingness to go for broke with gore, this sense of not entirely knowing where we stand gives the climax of The Home what edge it has.
Rated: 2.5/5

Variety
Davidson shows he may not have the chops to carry a horror film, while DeMonaco fails to deliver any thrills this time. Ultimately, itâ€™s a by-the-numbers effort that proves quite disappointing.

Davidson is in over his head conveying any sense of suspense or danger, and the blood-soaked climax is plays like a live action video game fantasy come to life.

Fortunately there is an ecstatically hyperviolent climax, hitting hard like a raging storm, which will make even the most jaded horror fan feel young again.

A muddled story and a series of missteps leave The Home a frustrating mess.

Odd and unsettling yet overall underwhelming, The Home's fascinating characters, intriguing mystery, and brooding atmosphere sadly don't make it over the finish line.

This is a rocky one. Itâ€™s a good premise & had potential but it ultimately falls a little flat. Some parts are a little comical when they werenâ€™t intended to be.
