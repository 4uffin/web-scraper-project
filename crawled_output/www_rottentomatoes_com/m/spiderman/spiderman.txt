Critics Consensus
Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch
Spider-Man isn't a daring new approach to comic adaptations, like Tim Burton's failed Batman. Rather, by sticking close to the source, it succeeds with flying colors.
Rated: 3/4

Independent (UK)
Spider-Man begins so promisingly that it looks less like a comic book movie than an off-beat comedy on metamorphosis.

Robert Philpot
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com
The movie counts as a modest success simply because it remains largely true to its roots, and the story that Lee and Ditko develop has a human side to it that's as strong -- if not stronger -- than its superhuman side.
Rated: 3/5

Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)
The casting is dream-perfect. I can’t say enough about Maguire's nuanced performance as Parker, while Willem Dafoe expertly juggles the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde complex of good-natured industrialist Norman Osborn and his villainous alter ego, the Green Goblin.

Bay Area Reporter
Willem Dafoe gives a campy muscularity to Spider-Man’s Green Goblin arch-rival, allowing fans of a darker bent the vicarious thrill of seeing a little spider-blood shed.

Simmons boldly steals scenes as the cigar-chomping, bombastic boss of the city's much-racking newspaper, The Daily Bugle.

Insanely memorable and such a classic. Green Goblin has always been my favorite villain since watching this especially seeing Willems performance. Absolutely menacing.

I'm seeing this movie again, on the big screen, for the first time since my childhood years, and yet, beyond the post-1978 "Superman"-levels of classic superhero nostalgia, visionary director Sam Raimi, iconic '89 "Batman" film composer Danny Elfman, and most importantly, the star himself, Tobey Maguire, have together become responsible for introducing audiences the very first live-action interpretation of the amazing, and most beloved, wall-crawling crime fighter: "Spider-Man" (2002), our hero everybody, YES!
