Spider-Man
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.

Joe Williams
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
Spider-Man isn't a daring new approach to comic adaptations, like Tim Burton's failed Batman. Rather, by sticking close to the source, it succeeds with flying colors.
Rated: 3/4

Anthony Quinn
Independent (UK)
Spider-Man begins so promisingly that it looks less like a comic book movie than an off-beat comedy on metamorphosis.

Robert Philpot
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com
The movie counts as a modest success simply because it remains largely true to its roots, and the story that Lee and Ditko develop has a human side to it that's as strong -- if not stronger -- than its superhuman side.
Rated: 3/5

Dave Johnston
Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)
The casting is dream-perfect. I can’t say enough about Maguire's nuanced performance as Parker, while Willem Dafoe expertly juggles the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde complex of good-natured industrialist Norman Osborn and his villainous alter ego, the Green Goblin.

David Lamble
Bay Area Reporter
Willem Dafoe gives a campy muscularity to Spider-Man’s Green Goblin arch-rival, allowing fans of a darker bent the vicarious thrill of seeing a little spider-blood shed.

Bruce Kirkland
Winnipeg Sun
Simmons boldly steals scenes as the cigar-chomping, bombastic boss of the city's much-racking newspaper, The Daily Bugle.

Mr. Hollywood
The OG. Its all here. Better than the ones that came after. CGI still a bit cheesy, maybe even more but you go with it. The acting bit over dramatic but again you go with it. Overall an enjoyable movie. Nice hero/villain dilemma
