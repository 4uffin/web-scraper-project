Not only does Spider-Man provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire.

To me the only marvel about this Marvel Comics cinema hero is that Americans should be going to see him in such large numbers.

It's the unexpectedness of finding a genuine couple of young lovers caught in its web that turns spectacle into sympathy and restores life-size emotion to outside imagination.

Spider-Man is an almost-perfect extension of the experience of reading comic-book adventures.
Rated: 3.5/4

What Spider-Man lacks in depth it more than makes up for in surface. Raimi has found his way back to the realm of the live-action cartoon, and he makes the most of his golden opportunity.
Rated: 3.5/5

In 2002, Sam Raimi changed the world thanks to the long-gestating first major live-action adaptation of Spider-Man, and it remains incredibly good.
Rated: 9/10

2002 was a big year for this film to be shown on million movie theaters. Spider-Man was one of the biggest superhero movies of all time, with Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker AKA Spider-Man is the best choice. William Dafoe played the perfect Norman Osborne AKA Green Goblin. the story was fantastic the action scenes were amazing. Sam Rami made history with this film.
critics and fans was excited this film came to the big screen. I give it A+ another amazing Marvel comic book film
