The Strangers are back -- more brutal and relentless than ever. When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Madelaine Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they've started. With nowhere to run and no one to trust, Maya must survive another horrific chapter of terror as The Strangers -- driven by a senseless, unceasing purpose -- pursue her, more than willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.
