The Strangers are back -- more brutal and relentless than ever. When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Madelaine Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they've started. With nowhere to run and no one to trust, Maya must survive another horrific chapter of terror as The Strangers -- driven by a senseless, unceasing purpose -- pursue her, more than willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.

Austin Chronicle
The only true horror here is that there’s another couple of hours of this still to come.

Flashbacks repeatedly hamper the film, knocking the thrill out of its pace and entertainment.

Jamie Graham
Empire Magazine
At once explaining too much and not enough, this middle segment of the trilogy fails to amp up the stranger danger. Perhaps the scariest thing is the end title: To be continued…
Rated: 2/5

Much like James Bond and The Avengers, the masked ghouls will return. When? Who knows, and at this point, who really cares? Certainly not the producers of this tired, unnecessary trilogy.
Rated: D

Olga Artemyeva
ScreenAnarchy
A badly CGI-ed wild boar then appears out of the trees to harass poor Maya some more, and leaves us with one last question: what can the third film possibly come up with to make us even more horrified by the misuse of Harlin’s abilities?

The AU Review
It all ultimately adds up to a rinse, recycle and repeat personality.
