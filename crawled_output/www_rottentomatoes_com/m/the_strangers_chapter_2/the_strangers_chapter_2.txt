The Strangers are back -- more brutal and relentless than ever. When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Madelaine Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they've started. With nowhere to run and no one to trust, Maya must survive another horrific chapter of terror as The Strangers -- driven by a senseless, unceasing purpose -- pursue her, more than willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.

Little White Lies
Flashbacks repeatedly hamper the film, knocking the thrill out of its pace and entertainment.
Rated: 2/5

Jamie Graham
Empire Magazine
At once explaining too much and not enough, this middle segment of the trilogy fails to amp up the stranger danger. Perhaps the scariest thing is the end title: To be continued…
Rated: 2/5

Mark Hanson
Slant Magazine
Mostly notable for its distracting resemblance to Rick Rosenthal’s Halloween II, Chapter 2 suggests for a while a needlessly extended epilogue to the first film.
Rated: 1/4

Matthew Jackson
Dread Central
If the first film was a chore because it was a predictable remake, the second is a chore because it has direction, but no real movement.
Rated: 1/5

Inverse
The Strangers - Chapter 2 is a worst-case scenario for a horror sequel to a subpar remake. It's so bad, there's a legitimate fear that its inefficiencies could retroactively tarnish the original's reputation.

Roberto Tyler Ortiz
Loud and Clear Reviews
There are glimpses of craft here – the hospital setting, the occasional burst of tension, the practical stunt work – but they can’t disguise the lack of substance.
Rated: 2/5
