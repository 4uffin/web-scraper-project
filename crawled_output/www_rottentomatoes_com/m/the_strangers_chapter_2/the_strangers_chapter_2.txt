The Strangers are back -- more brutal and relentless than ever. When they learn that one of their victims, Maya (Madelaine Petsch), is still alive, they return to finish what they've started. With nowhere to run and no one to trust, Maya must survive another horrific chapter of terror as The Strangers -- driven by a senseless, unceasing purpose -- pursue her, more than willing to kill anyone who stands in their way.

Bloody Disgusting
A post-credit tease weakly sets the stage for the final chapter, a job that this installment was meant to achieve. But Chapter 2 throttles and chokes out any lingering interest in the Strangers and this confounding trilogy.
Rated: 1/5

Brian Tallerico
RogerEbert.com
The 'Two Towers’ of this series is a leaden bore, a movie that alternates between making no sense at all and insulting the intelligence of the pour souls who see it.
Rated: 1/4

The Blogging Banshee
The Strangers: Chapter 2 is a welcome improvement over the first film, upping the intensity as it adds to the lore in unexpected ways, but will certainly polarize audiences.
Rated: 6/10

There are so many moments that don't make sense. Just little tiny inconsistencies.

The Strangers: Chapter 2 manages to be an improvement over its predecessor, but still feels like it's betraying the premise of the franchise./
Rated: 4/10

Looper.com
While it doesn't offer anything you haven't seen in a slasher movie before, the pivot to survival thriller mode feels like a breath of fresh air after a tiresome prior instalment with no unique ideas.
Rated: 6/10
