The Naked Gun
What to Know
Critics Consensus
With Liam Neeson's gravelly gravitas proving to be a perfect fit for Frank Drebin's deadpan buffoonery, The Naked Gun revives the original trilogy's daffy sense of humor like it never went out of style.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Liam Neeson hits the mark as Drebin and The Naked Gun fires on all bawdy cylinders, dishing out a mandatory sentence on man’s laughter.

It certainly felt good to laugh and bask in some absurdity.

Sydney Morning Herald
There are certainly laughs to be had from all this, and you have to admire Neeson for getting back in touch with his inner adolescent and playing the clown with such zest.
Rated: 3/5

The Naked Gun is shooting blanks. Not all the time. But some of the time.

Algo Más Que Cine
Liam Neeson embraces absurdity with deadpan brilliance, and Pamela Anderson adds a surreal charm. Schaffer’s reboot may not reach ZAZ’s heights, but it’s joyfully ridiculous and a rare, welcome throwback to the golden age of parody.
Rated: 7/10

If you plan on going to see The Naked Gun be prepared to laugh like you have never laughed before. This is a film that is literally a laugh a minute and is not afraid to bring back the type of edgy comedy that many thought was gone from Hollywood forever.
Rated: 4.5/5

A fun,gut-busting and laugh-out-loud hilarious legacy sequel that really shouldn’t work,but does thanks to the comedic chops of Liam Neeson and Pamela Anderson amongst many in the cast. One of the year’s funniest and proving that the spoof genre is back and better than ever! And so is Police Squad!!!🚔🚨🍩☕️🌭😆🤣☃️⛄️
