The Naked Gun
What to Know
Critics Consensus
With Liam Neeson's gravelly gravitas proving to be a perfect fit for Frank Drebin's deadpan buffoonery, The Naked Gun revives the original trilogy's daffy sense of humor like it never went out of style.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Liam Neeson hits the mark as Drebin and The Naked Gun fires on all bawdy cylinders, dishing out a mandatory sentence on man’s laughter.

It certainly felt good to laugh and bask in some absurdity.

Sandra Hall
Sydney Morning Herald
There are certainly laughs to be had from all this, and you have to admire Neeson for getting back in touch with his inner adolescent and playing the clown with such zest.
Rated: 3/5

The Naked Gun is shooting blanks. Not all the time. But some of the time.

Perhaps. “The Naked Gun” is not wholly successful, but neither is it a mar on the current cinematic landscape. There’s no great sense of reflectiveness in what its comedic instincts opt to consider. But its pleasantness is its own boon.

Algo Más Que Cine
Liam Neeson embraces absurdity with deadpan brilliance, and Pamela Anderson adds a surreal charm. Schaffer’s reboot may not reach ZAZ’s heights, but it’s joyfully ridiculous and a rare, welcome throwback to the golden age of parody.
Rated: 7/10
