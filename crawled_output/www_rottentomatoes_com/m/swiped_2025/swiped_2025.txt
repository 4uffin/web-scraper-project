Inspired by the provocative real-life story of the visionary founder of online dating platform Bumble, "Swiped" introduces recent college grad Whitney Wolfe, played by Lily James, as she uses extraordinary grit and ingenuity to break into the male-dominated tech industry and launch an innovative, globally lauded dating app (two, actually), paving the way to becoming the youngest female self-made billionaire.

Critics Consensus
Glossy to a fault, Swiped packages its true events as a rote reenactment instead of delivering the feminist story it could have been.

It's far too shallow of a movie for such an important subject.

Adrian Horton
Guardian
The history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swiped’s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it.
Rated: 3/5

Alissa Wilkinson
New York Times
Swiped aims to explore the difficulties of being a woman in a man’s world, from workplaces to the internet more widely. It does so in broad strokes with predictable characterization.

Movies We Texted About
Swiped tells an important and necessary story about resilience and female empowerment in the tech industry. It's sustained by a magnificent central performance from Lily James, which alone makes it worth watching.
Rated: B-

Erik Childress
Movie Madness Podcast
Wants to be both The Social Network and a tale of workplace toxicity but the screenplay makes no efforts to offer true commentary on a cornucopia of related issues and instead, like many real-life tales, proceeds to offer us the Wikipedia version.
Rated: 2/4

EscribiendoCine
Lily James carries the film with ease, not only as an actress but also as a producer, and powerfully conveys a story of female empowerment in a universe historically dominated by the male gaze. [Full review in Spanish]

I saw the film at TIFF and loved it. Very well directed and funny. Reminded me of some of my favorite bio pics like THE BIG SHORT and SOCIAL NETWORK. Cant wait to watch again!

A pleasant film that could have been more remarkable had it dared to be more incisive. It has moments of brilliance and others that are somewhat weaker, but overall it's a pleasant experience, though it won't be particularly memorable later this year.
