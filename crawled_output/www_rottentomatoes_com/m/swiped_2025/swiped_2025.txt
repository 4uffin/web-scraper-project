Critics Consensus
Glossy to a fault, Swiped packages its true events as a rote reenactment instead of delivering the feminist story it could have been.

It's far too shallow of a movie for such an important subject.

Adrian Horton
Guardian
The history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swiped’s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it.
Rated: 3/5

Alissa Wilkinson
New York Times
Swiped aims to explore the difficulties of being a woman in a man’s world, from workplaces to the internet more widely. It does so in broad strokes with predictable characterization.

Swiped captures the ambition and toxicity of startup culture, showing how innovation in dating apps came at a personal cost for Whitney Wolfe Herd.
Rated: C

Deadline Hollywood Daily
The beauty of Swiped, however, is its lightness of touch, and star James understands the assignment perfectly well.

Swiped is constructed well-enough for the movie it’s trying to be, but its lack of ambition and nuance keep it from being its best self.

Madalynn S.
As a woman in sales—a very male-dominated industry—this movie made me smile at the end but also had me nodding through so many familiar moments. It wasn’t meant to be a hard-hitting documentary, but an uplifting story that still highlighted real challenges women face every day.
Me Too may have brought awareness years ago, but has much really changed? We still find ourselves proving our worth daily, being judged more harshly for mistakes, and too often labeled “hostile” or “aggressive” for behaviors men are praised for. That reality came through here in a light but meaningful way.
I also noticed that most of the negative reviews are from men—no surprise. Of course it got a low rating from people who will never truly understand what it’s like to be a woman in a male-dominated space or even, in some cases, a “gender hire.” For me, though, this film was encouraging, relatable, and exactly the reminder I needed: keep pushing, ladies

'Swiped' is a mildly entertaining conventional biopic that doesn't dig deep enough to serve its purpose.

Five Stars
A powerful, timely film that mirrors real-life events with striking honesty. It’s female-oriented in the best way—perfectly in step with the spirit of the #MeToo movement. Whitney’s courage to stand up to the tech industry’s boys’ club is both motivational and uplifting. Whether her net worth is $200 million or $1.3 billion doesn’t matter; her fight for women’s rights is what shines. If seven stars were possible, I’d give it all seven.

I saw the film at TIFF and loved it. Very well directed and funny. Reminded me of some of my favorite bio pics like THE BIG SHORT and SOCIAL NETWORK. Cant wait to watch again!
