Inspired by the provocative real-life story of the visionary founder of online dating platform Bumble, "Swiped" introduces recent college grad Whitney Wolfe, played by Lily James, as she uses extraordinary grit and ingenuity to break into the male-dominated tech industry and launch an innovative, globally lauded dating app (two, actually), paving the way to becoming the youngest female self-made billionaire.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Glossy to a fault, Swiped packages its true events as a rote reenactment instead of delivering the feminist story it could have been.

It's far too shallow of a movie for such an important subject.
Rated: 2/4

Guardian
The history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swiped’s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it.
Rated: 3/5

Alissa Wilkinson
New York Times
Swiped aims to explore the difficulties of being a woman in a man’s world, from workplaces to the internet more widely. It does so in broad strokes with predictable characterization.

Deadline Hollywood Daily
The beauty of Swiped, however, is its lightness of touch, and star James understands the assignment perfectly well.

Swiped is constructed well-enough for the movie it’s trying to be, but its lack of ambition and nuance keep it from being its best self.
Rated: 6/10

What makes Swiped really stand out are the actors involved.

'Swiped' is a mildly entertaining conventional biopic that doesn't dig deep enough to serve its purpose.

Five Stars
A powerful, timely film that mirrors real-life events with striking honesty. It’s female-oriented in the best way—perfectly in step with the spirit of the #MeToo movement. Whitney’s courage to stand up to the tech industry’s boys’ club is both motivational and uplifting. Whether her net worth is $200 million or $1.3 billion doesn’t matter; her fight for women’s rights is what shines. If seven stars were possible, I’d give it all seven.

I saw the film at TIFF and loved it. Very well directed and funny. Reminded me of some of my favorite bio pics like THE BIG SHORT and SOCIAL NETWORK. Cant wait to watch again!

A pleasant film that could have been more remarkable had it dared to be more incisive. It has moments of brilliance and others that are somewhat weaker, but overall it's a pleasant experience, though it won't be particularly memorable later this year.
