Inspired by the provocative real-life story of the visionary founder of online dating platform Bumble, "Swiped" introduces recent college grad Whitney Wolfe, played by Lily James, as she uses extraordinary grit and ingenuity to break into the male-dominated tech industry and launch an innovative, globally lauded dating app (two, actually), paving the way to becoming the youngest female self-made billionaire.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Glossy to a fault, Swiped packages its true events as a rote reenactment instead of delivering the feminist story it could have been.

It's far too shallow of a movie for such an important subject.

Guardian
The history of how online dating went from deeply uncool to de rigueur is one worth telling, and Swipedâ€™s methods, corny and contrived as they can be, are proficient enough to do it.
Rated: 3/5

New York Times
Swiped aims to explore the difficulties of being a woman in a manâ€™s world, from workplaces to the internet more widely. It does so in broad strokes with predictable characterization.

Casey's Movie Mania
Lily James excels in Rachel Lee Goldenberg's formulaic but engaging biographical drama.

Cinemalogue
James is excellent, but the film doesnâ€™t offer much fresh insight into Whitneyâ€™s rise-and-fall-and-rise again arc or the toxic workplace culture she ultimately conquers.

We're Watching What?!
We've seen too many better crafted founder biopics at this point and if there's anything exceptional about the subject aside from her gender the film fails to convey it. Though it does successfully capture a fraction of the horror of being a woman in tech

Honestly itâ€™s as disappointing as it is comical, to see the amount of men - in particular - giving milk toast comments on this with zero merit.
This film may not get it perfect, but it certainly zooms in on a very uncomfortable, but accurate, piece of being a woman in these environments. Itâ€™s a hard thing to palpably describe and if this film did one thing powerfully, it was that.
I hope thatâ€™s what the women who watch this take from it - that abuse is coded in so many shades, it can feel impossible to see. I think Lily James, and the writers, did their job there. Period.
Iâ€™d recommend this to any woman, but really any person, trying to take a magnifying glass to their career, and the nuances of their role within it. The responsibility, really.
Kudos to this team.

For any woman in corporate, there are moments here that will resonate. Remember the film Working Girl - Melanie Griffiths - and she does all the work, save the company as is then allowed to be an entry level worker instead of a secretary? Swipe shows how far weâ€™ve come - perhaps not as far as we think. At least the heroine here ends up with more than that crap job. It is worth a watch. The second half perhaps lacks a bit of energy, which is a mystery. Maybe we just donâ€™t know how to show female success on screen. Itâ€™s not like there are many movies about female billionaires â€¦

I don't know how to feel after watching Swiped. 1st of all, it's not awful, I can see people having a fun time with it, but unfortunately what I thought was the best part of the movie was the acting and the strong performance, and I mean that because the movie literally starts by telling us that the performances aren't actually what they really went through, it's just to lightened the movie in total. That really left me disappointed in the end, because if you're going to make a biopic, don't tell us that, it automatically lowers people's expectations, and if you can't tell a biopic right, then don't make a movie out of it. If they didn't say that, then I would have had a better experience, but that's just my opinion, I hope that there will be some people who will enjoy Swiped, but for me, really disappointed

I felt the story was much less accurate then what really was going on. The movie is trying to be very optimistic in order to empower women tech capabilities, but reality was much more complicated, I can guess. I was very
Very disappointed ðŸ˜ž
