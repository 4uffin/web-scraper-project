Barry Levitt
Empire Magazine
Though The Man In My Basement juggles a few too many ideas, Nadia Latif has crafted an unnerving thriller with dynamite performances from leads Willem Dafoe and Corey Hawkins.
Rated: 3/5

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
This audacious feature debut, The Man In My Basement, from the Sudanese-British theatre director Nadia Latif belongs to the Henry James school — deviously, wickedly so.
Rated: 4/5

Mashable
For all the atmosphere and the grounded yet disturbing performances, the movie fumbles its finale, delivering neither nerve-shredding scares nor a heart-filling nor heart-wrenching resolution.

Black Girl Watching
Corey Hawkins and Willem Dafoe are formidable; Latif’s direction is stylish and the cinematography of the historic Black neighborhood is stunning, but the message of the film seems to be that getting revenge against your oppressors makes you just as bad.

Radio Times
Dafoe is especially compelling, pulling off a combination of charm and creepiness with consummate ease.

Interesting storytelling and solid acting w a decent build up that didnt end up revealing anything to the audience they dont already know, so the ending ends up half hearted.

James G.
I’m only given a passing grade because of the acting, which was super, but it really should be a two-man play, it would be one of the best out there however as a film, we leave the lead characters frequently and with no purpose.
