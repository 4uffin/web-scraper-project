A knock on the door from a mysterious businessman, Anniston Bennet (Willem Dafoe), brings a bizarre and lucrative proposition; rent his dusty stand-up basement out for the summer and receive enough money to clear his debts for good. Once Charles accepts, he finds himself led down a terrifying path that confronts his family's ghosts and locks the men in a terrifying puzzle, at the heart of it race, the source of their traumas and the root of all evil.

Barry Levitt
Empire Magazine
Though The Man In My Basement juggles a few too many ideas, Nadia Latif has crafted an unnerving thriller with dynamite performances from leads Willem Dafoe and Corey Hawkins.
Rated: 3/5

The Times (UK)
This audacious feature debut, The Man In My Basement, from the Sudanese-British theatre director Nadia Latif belongs to the Henry James school — deviously, wickedly so.
Rated: 4/5

Mashable
For all the atmosphere and the grounded yet disturbing performances, the movie fumbles its finale, delivering neither nerve-shredding scares nor a heart-filling nor heart-wrenching resolution.

CBR
It is worth a watch for fans of Dafoe and does prompt the audience to consider bigger questions about race, privilege, and power, even if it's not quite able to answer them.
Rated: 5/10

Third Coast Review
The filmmaker’s use of imagery and lighting is frequently effective and impactful, but it’s the actors who make the film spark and give what we’re watching any kind of smoke.
Rated: 2.5/4

Black Girl Watching
Corey Hawkins and Willem Dafoe are formidable; Latif’s direction is stylish and the cinematography of the historic Black neighborhood is stunning, but the message of the film seems to be that getting revenge against your oppressors makes you just as bad.

Interesting storytelling and solid acting w a decent build up that didnt end up revealing anything to the audience they dont already know, so the ending ends up half hearted.

James G.
I’m only given a passing grade because of the acting, which was super, but it really should be a two-man play, it would be one of the best out there however as a film, we leave the lead characters frequently and with no purpose.
