Everyone's favorite felons are back, and this time, they've got company. In the new action-packed chapter from DreamWorks Animation's acclaimed comedy smash about a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws, our now-reformed Bad Guys are trying (very, very hard) to be good, but instead find themselves hijacked into a high-stakes, globe-trotting heist, masterminded by a new team of criminals they never saw coming: The Bad Girls.

While it doesn’t quite recapture the spark of surprise that made the first outing such a pleasant detour from franchise fatigue, it still delivers where it counts.
Rated: 3/4

The Bad Guys 2 is no masterpiece — the filmmakers are more enamored with fart-in-a-spacesuit gags than even most kids are likely to be — but it is goofy fun.

Yes, it gets complicated, as these things do. But never so tangled that you lose the thread.

ABC Radio (Australia)
Uses the animation in a heightened, expressive, silly way, but the stunts are all framed and shot like live action. There's a lot for adults to enjoy, but kids will still like the usual pratfalls and sight gags. … Eight thumbs up, if I were a tarantula.

Daily Telegraph (Australia)
A quality all-ages animated movie knows how to keep everything on the move without boring or exhausting its target audience, and The Bad Guys 2 covers this base with absolute ease.
Rated: 3.5/5

The pace is as fast and the plotting as frenetic as the first film, yet the characters are even more charming and funny this time around. And the standard of the animation, especially in the action scenes, is top shelf.
Rated: 3/5

The Bad Guys 2 was the most incredible movie I've ever seen! I counted down its release for 466 days, and I have to say, it did not disappoint. The animation was amazing, the scenes were really well done, and the movie was hilarious. Now I'm desperately waiting for the Bad Guys 3 to come out!
