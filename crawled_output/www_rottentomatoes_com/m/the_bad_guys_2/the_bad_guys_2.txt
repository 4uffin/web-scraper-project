Everyone's favorite felons are back, and this time, they've got company. In the new action-packed chapter from DreamWorks Animation's acclaimed comedy smash about a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws, our now-reformed Bad Guys are trying (very, very hard) to be good, but instead find themselves hijacked into a high-stakes, globe-trotting heist, masterminded by a new team of criminals they never saw coming: The Bad Girls.

While it doesn’t quite recapture the spark of surprise that made the first outing such a pleasant detour from franchise fatigue, it still delivers where it counts.
Rated: 3/4

New York Times
The Bad Guys 2 is no masterpiece — the filmmakers are more enamored with fart-in-a-spacesuit gags than even most kids are likely to be — but it is goofy fun.

Yes, it gets complicated, as these things do. But never so tangled that you lose the thread.

Daily Telegraph (Australia)
A quality all-ages animated movie knows how to keep everything on the move without boring or exhausting its target audience, and The Bad Guys 2 covers this base with absolute ease.
Rated: 3.5/5

The pace is as fast and the plotting as frenetic as the first film, yet the characters are even more charming and funny this time around. And the standard of the animation, especially in the action scenes, is top shelf.
Rated: 3/5

Simon Miraudo
Movie Squad (RTRFM 92.1)
A charming, funny and compelling-enough (for kids) Mission: Impossible riff that also, inexplicably, has one of the most graphic open-mouth kisses ever committed to screen.
Rated: 3/5

A good, satisfying family movie. Definitely geared more towards a younger audience but still an enjoyable watch for all ages.

This was a really enjoyable, action packed animation that is great for adults and kids alike. The plot is interesting without being overly complicated and the characters are unforgettable. You'll be on the edge of your seat and almost cheering in the aisles.
