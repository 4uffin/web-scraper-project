Dr. John Markway, an anthropologist with an interest in psychic phenomena, takes two specially selected women to Hill House, a reportedly haunted mansion. Eleanor (Julie Harris), a lonely, eccentric woman with a supernatural event in her past, and the bold Theodora (Claire Bloom), who has ESP, join John and the mansion's heir, cynical Luke (Russ Tamblyn). They are immediately overwhelmed by strange sounds and events, and Eleanor comes to believe the house is alive and speaking directly to her.

Critics Consensus
Both psychological and supernatural, The Haunting is a chilling character study.

Pauline Kael
The New Yorker
An elegantly sinister scare movie, literate and expensive (though basically a traditional ghost story), with those two fine actresses Claire Bloom and Julie Harris.

Ian Freer
Empire Magazine
Wise brilliantly uses black and white widescreen to strand his characters in odd-shaped rooms or corridors, making the watcher's eye skitter frantically over the letterbox screen to catch every ingeniously rendered detail.
Rated: 5/5

James Powers
The Hollywood Reporter
When The Haunting digs into the internals of its story, summons its spirits and lets them play havoc with cold reason, it has a power and fervor unmatched by any film ghost stories.

Joe Lipsett
Horror Queers Podcast
Wise's use of the camera is vital to creating a sense of tension and atmosphere; it's practically its own character. Meanwhile, Theo is a vital LGBT character in horror history: an out woman in a 60s film is a true rarity.
Rated: 4/5

them.
Dripping with queer subtext, this 1963 adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House is a master class in reading between the lines.

Queerty
The Haunting endures as a horror classic, albeit one that doesnt quite the credit it deserves as an unusual queer love story. Heres a movie both scary and romantic as Hell.
Rated: 4/4

Despite excellent visuals, campy writing (scenes & dialogues) doesn’t hold up

Filme mais ou menos, o roteiro é fraco, as cenas são mais ou menos, o elenco é fraco, e ninguém ajuda a melhorar o filme, a história é mais
ou
menos a, e o filme deveria ter cenas bem melhores e relevantes, para fazer o filme ser bom.

Possible the best ghost story ever filmed. Being old (1963) and being low budget it relies on imagination and is not spoilt by special effects.

I didn’t find it particularly scary and not much happens. However, it is a good film with a spooky atmosphere, period charm and set in a great location.
I found the main character somewhat annoying. Her internal monologue was disturbing and she’s certainly believable as a crazy person, but she’s also a bit obnoxious.

Based on the novel by Shirley Jackson (author of "The Lottery") its an excellent movie that doesn't get its due.
One of my top ten faves.
