During a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, a veteran mariner (Robert Redford) awakes to find his vessel taking on water after a collision with a stray shipping container. With his radio and navigation equipment disabled, he sails unknowingly into a violent storm and barely escapes with his life. With any luck, the ocean currents may carry him into a shipping lane -- but, with supplies dwindling and the sharks circling, the sailor is forced to face his own mortality.

A vital, exciting piece of work from Mr. Redford, an actor whom you'd have been forgiven for counting out by now.

It's a rare example of pure cinema, and that, in itself, gives it a stature to which few Hollywood films these days aspire.

It’s engaging, thrilling and speaks to something about the human spirit that is inspiring. Easily one of the year’s best indie films.

All is Lost is a commendable and engaging motion picture, but also a rare achievement in spare filmmaking.

I wanted to watch a Robert Redford movie I hadn't seen before to honor his death. I saw that "All is Lost" got good reviews and showed him as an old man. So I really really wanted to like it.
Spoiler alert: the opening minutes give the impression that he dies in the end
After the opening narration, there is almost no dialogue. Redford does a terrific job of portraying Our Man's thought process and action plans and big feelings.
I was held in suspense to see what would happen, hoping he'd be rescued. I had to emotionally prepare myself for him not making it.
Not an easy watch, it took a lot of patience. But I'm glad he made the movie, and I'm glad I stuck it out!

The best part of this movie is that it tells a story without much dialogue.
That's good storytelling.
The thing that bugs me is it took the director twenty minutes to show us a man patching up a boat.
I needed a faster pace.
The poor guy in this story (Redford) has so many bad things happen to him that it almost gets comical.
Just how bad can a person's luck be?
Overall, I was bored.
I felt that there needed to be more than just a survival plot, but then again, I probably would have complained about a tacked on melodrama had they gone that route.
I don't know what would make me like this film.
It's worth a look but not a rewatch.

Great movie.
This is a different experience than what most people want.
It's not a formula superhero movie, horror flick, rom-com, etc.
It's a great story, directing, acting...it makes you think.
It's also not a political movie, some of the bad reviews are people who don't like Redford's politics, it is not a political movie.
Also, I'm a sailor, a lot of bad reviews are by fellow sailors who don't like the movie because of technical errors by the character or director.
Lighten up, this is not a sailing movie!
It's a movie about life, facing challenges, perseverance, and faith.
