Weapons
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

It's an ingenious little clockwork marvel of a film.

KT Mahe
For Your Reference Podcast
Played too straight to be satire and not succinct enough to be a critique, Creggers relies on his signature aesthetics for Weapons.
Rated: 3/5

For Your Reference Podcast
Polished and well-made, Weapons hooks you early with its concept and characters. But too many shifting perspectives dilute the story, leading to a final act that feels disillusioning. Still, expect it to be all the rage.
Rated: 3.5/5

It was entertaining with some jump scares that got you. But then the second half of movie felt like a different movie still entertaining but felt off a bit. I’d still recommend it.

A ton of unnecessary portions to the plot. Jump scares and immediate laughter afterwards. Terrible story telling.
