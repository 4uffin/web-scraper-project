What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Bill Goodykoontz
Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

Andrew Kendall
Stabroek News
When the actual use of the missing children as part of the villain’s plan reveals itself, there’s a lingering way that “Weapons” kind of deflates in its import. Even its name begins to feel like a misnomer.

John Serba
Decider
Cregger treads oh-so-carefully when it means it most, drawing an exquisite, everything’s-not-quite-all-right kind of non-conclusion that feels like the stuff of a true story.

Over-exposition kills the movie magic. There's no mystery left. Cregger understands that.
