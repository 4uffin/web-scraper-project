What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

Stabroek News
When the actual use of the missing children as part of the villain’s plan reveals itself, there’s a lingering way that “Weapons” kind of deflates in its import. Even its name begins to feel like a misnomer.

Decider
Cregger treads oh-so-carefully when it means it most, drawing an exquisite, everything’s-not-quite-all-right kind of non-conclusion that feels like the stuff of a true story.

Over-exposition kills the movie magic. There's no mystery left. Cregger understands that.

It was so slow for about the first 1-1/2 hours. It was good towards the end when the pace finally picked up. Had me surprised and creeped out during the last part..(good thing).
I was hoping for a better ending, but maybe a Weapons 2could happen??

Creepy and Entertaining. In the back of my mind I kept thinking somehow this was going to segue into a. plot twist or metaphor about school shootings - especially when Josh Brolin’s kid was portrayed as a bully to the one ‘surviving’ kid and Archer kept apologizing like he had done something wrong raising the kid- -and there was a weird random semiautomatic gun that appears in the sky during a Josh Brolin nightmare - but it turned out I was way overthinking. I blame M. Night Shyamalan. This was just a fun, sometimes campy - the crazy aunt, the principal, the frazzled cop and the kid who played the drug addict were great - creepy, supernatural movie. I saw it in the theater, and as a GenX, 80s movie junkie I really miss the great, entertaining movies coming out every week on the big screen,. And this had a throwback vibe - it seemed to be set present day with police trying to be civil, ring cameras and one kids iPad, but not a lot of everyone on cellphones or obvious tech everywhere. Bottom line is it was a smart, fresh take on an early fall , Halloween season, bizarre mystery, but with serious actors like Amy Madigan (so freaky and disturbing)
and Josh Brolin , a former Goonie who I will watch doing literally anything (I sold him Marlboro Reds back when I was 19 at an airport gift shop in New York , so I feel like I know him lol).
I thought the teacher was kind of annoying and grating, I’m a teacher myself, and I know teachers like this, but once she teamed up with Josh Brolin’s character to try to figure out what in the Holy X -Files was happening, I found her more tolerable. Definitely recommend for Pre-Halloween Fun.
