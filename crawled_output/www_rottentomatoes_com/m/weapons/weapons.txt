Weapons
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Zach Cregger spins an expertly crafted yarn of terrifying mystery and thrilling intrigue in Weapons, a sophomore triumph that solidifies his status as a master of horror.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Loaded with bold elements that make it not just a great horror film, but a noteworthy film overall, Weapons is ultimately an impressive, genre-bending experience that’s original, entertaining, and satisfying despite its faint air of ambiguity.

Arizona Republic
This is definitely a horror movie, increasingly by the minute. It’s also really funny — in places — and the finale combines horror and comedy in a way that doesn’t cheapen either one.
Rated: 4.5/5

Justin Chang
NPR
Zach Cregger's ingenious and exultant new horror film is like a Stephen King riff on The Pied Piper of Hamelin, and it has a wonderful campfire-tale spookiness.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
It's a smorgasbord. It is a full meal of stuff and it doesn't all work, but there is enough in there that is genuinely kind of 'Oh Gosh!'...

It's an ingenious little clockwork marvel of a film.

KT Mahe
For Your Reference Podcast
Played too straight to be satire and not succinct enough to be a critique, Creggers relies on his signature aesthetics for Weapons.
Rated: 3/5

For Your Reference Podcast
Polished and well-made, Weapons hooks you early with its concept and characters. But too many shifting perspectives dilute the story, leading to a final act that feels disillusioning. Still, expect it to be all the rage.
Rated: 3.5/5

It was just bad. I love horror movies and see plenty of bad ones and this one both of us agreed on. The great reviews got us in the theater but we just did not see what others liked so much about this film. I will stop using reviews so heavily after this one. I'll now go by the trailers way more I guess.

It was entertaining with some jump scares that got you. But then the second half of movie felt like a different movie still entertaining but felt off a bit. I’d still recommend it.
