Brian Tallerico

From its opening shots, it aggressively and pretentiously shows viewers all its cards, stubbornly unwilling to delve deeper than its attention-starved aesthetic.
Rated: 1.5/4

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
Mr. Berger and Mr. Farrell adopt an incongruously jaunty tone in a failed attempt to wring laughs out of this abundantly awful man.

Screen International
Playfully, almost proudly shallow as it feeds off the feverish highs and lows of its addicted protagonist, this neo-noir offers plenty of buzzy delight -- that is, until the story’s pretensions bring down the whole house of cards.

The biggest problem Berger has is Joffe’s script, which is once again undercooked and spartan in the same way The American was, with a wholly wrong protagonist for the style.

A huge mess. I just saw no point to it.

Loud and Clear Reviews
The ballad may feel more like a ditty than the epic it aspires to be, but Farrell’s magnetic performance and Berger’s visual poetry ensure this small player deals a memorable, if not entirely winning, hand.
Rated: 3/5
