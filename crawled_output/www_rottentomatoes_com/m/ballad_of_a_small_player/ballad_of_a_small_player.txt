Brian Tallerico
RogerEbert.com
From its opening shots, it aggressively and pretentiously shows viewers all its cards, stubbornly unwilling to delve deeper than its attention-starved aesthetic.
Rated: 1.5/4

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
Mr. Berger and Mr. Farrell adopt an incongruously jaunty tone in a failed attempt to wring laughs out of this abundantly awful man.

Tim Grierson
Screen International
Playfully, almost proudly shallow as it feeds off the feverish highs and lows of its addicted protagonist, this neo-noir offers plenty of buzzy delight -- that is, until the story’s pretensions bring down the whole house of cards.

...Rowan Joffe's script wasn't up to the task, and behind the desperate screams, the glitter of the casinos, and the spiritual festivals, there was nothing but smoke. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 2/5

Doug Jamieson
The Jam Report
A stylishly empty vessel that coasts on atmosphere and Colin Farrell’s electric work, but never really convinces us it has anything deeper to say.
Rated: 2.5/5

Geek Vibes Nation
Ballad of a Small Player is the first major misfire for Edward Berger as he continues to push his way into the mainstream of film culture.
Rated: 4/10
