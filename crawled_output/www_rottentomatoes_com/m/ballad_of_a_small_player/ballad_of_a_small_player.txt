Brian Tallerico

From its opening shots, it aggressively and pretentiously shows viewers all its cards, stubbornly unwilling to delve deeper than its attention-starved aesthetic.
Rated: 1.5/4

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
Mr. Berger and Mr. Farrell adopt an incongruously jaunty tone in a failed attempt to wring laughs out of this abundantly awful man.

Tim Grierson
Screen International
Playfully, almost proudly shallow as it feeds off the feverish highs and lows of its addicted protagonist, this neo-noir offers plenty of buzzy delight -- that is, until the story’s pretensions bring down the whole house of cards.

Geek Vibes Nation
Ballad of a Small Player is the first major misfire for Edward Berger as he continues to push his way into the mainstream of film culture.
Rated: 4/10

The biggest problem Berger has is Joffe’s script, which is once again undercooked and spartan in the same way The American was, with a wholly wrong protagonist for the style.

A huge mess. I just saw no point to it.
