Critics Consensus
There's Something About Mary proves that unrelentingly, unabashedly puerile humor doesn't necessarily come at the expense of a film's heart.

If the Farrellys don't know yet how to arrange a group of actors in a shot, they do know how to exploit [their cast] to the fullest, and how to push a joke to its breaking point; their taste is as bad as their timing is exquisite.

If the sight of a large chunk of a man's private parts caught in the teeth of a zipper is funny -- and I'm not saying it isn't -- then have I got a movie for you.

There's Something About Mary earns its spot as one of the funniest comedy movies ever made.

What begins as a seemingly lightweight romantic comedy gradually expands into a surprisingly sophisticated exploration of romantic obsession and self-delusion.

Who would have guessed that the brothers who created the stupid gross-out comedy film “Dumb and Dumber” would be able to change tracks and make an enjoyable, yet still gross, motion picture?
Rated: 3.5/4

Has not held up well. The gross out humor also is just not funny. Even Mary is kind of shallow, easily duped and quick to throw away her principles.(Dating Healy, who she literally just met, even though he treats and talks about people with disabilities with total disrespect, and her own brother has a cognitive disability). The ending, and just overall structure of the film, is also way too predictable and formulaic.

Hacky humor that appeals to few not currently engaged in a bong session or over the age of 10.

"There's Something About Mary" stands as a comedic masterpiece, a film that, even decades later, continues to elicit genuine belly laughs and a sense of pure, unadulterated joy. From its opening scene, you're drawn into a world of escalating absurdity and brilliant physical comedy, all centered around the utterly charming Mary and the string of hilariously inept men vying for her affection. Ben Stiller, in one of his most iconic roles, perfectly embodies the lovestruck Ted, whose desperate attempts to reconnect with Mary lead to a series of increasingly outrageous and unforgettable predicaments. The Farrelly Brothers' genius lies in their ability to push the boundaries of taste while maintaining a surprising sweetness at its core. The humor is daring, often shocking, but never feels mean-spirited. Cameron Diaz shines as Mary, radiating an effortless beauty and a delightful naivety that makes her the perfect innocent bystander to the chaos unfolding around her. Matt Dillon, Lee Evans, and Chris Elliott all deliver standout performances, each contributing their own unique brand of comedic brilliance to the ensemble. What truly elevates this film beyond a typical gross-out comedy is its undeniable heart. Despite all the bizarre scenarios involving hair gel, dog attacks, and surprising revelations, you genuinely root for Ted to find happiness. "There's Something About Mary" is more than just a funny movie; it's a cultural touchstone, a film that proved that intelligent, boundary-pushing comedy could also be incredibly popular and enduringly beloved. It's a cinematic experience that leaves you with a wide grin and a renewed appreciation for the sheer brilliance of a well-crafted comedic script and perfectly executed performances.
