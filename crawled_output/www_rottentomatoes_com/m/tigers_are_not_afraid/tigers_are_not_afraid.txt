Tigers Are Not Afraid is unrelenting in the darkness of its material, but Issa L√≥pez merges the genre conventions of fairy tales and ghost stories with the genuinely dizzying emotions of childhood.

For me, it‚Äôs an undeniably effective film. I was brought to tears several times throughout the movie, especially at the end.

As a writer-director, L√≥pez mines beauty, even excitement, out of hopelessness and terror, delivering escape for some and a wake-up call to others.

The fairy-tale, magical/horror elements are a little too constructive and strenuously uplifting.

So well done. The acting is incredible, and it tells such a compelling horror story within the context of a real life horror story that is all too real

Incredible Spanish horror film that blends magical realism with awful real-life terror akin to the works of Guillermo del Toro & Stephen King. It's powerful & haunting.

I can‚Äôt rate this movie highly enough. I wish I could give it 10 stars. The acting of the children in this movie is flawless. If I remember correctly, none of them were really actors. The story is a realistic blend of brutal reality and fantasy or supernatural. Though an English-dubbed version is out there I highly recommend watching the Spanish language one with subtitles. It‚Äôs one of the most profoundly moving and beautiful films I‚Äôve ever seen. One of my all-time favorites. If you don‚Äôt care for watching foreign movies with subtitles, I get it, but make an exception for this one. You will not regret it. üêÖüêÖüêÖ
