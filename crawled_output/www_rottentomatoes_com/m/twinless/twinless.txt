Twinless isn’t what you might expect it to be. It’s much more normal, and therefore much more haunting, than that.

Though O’Brien is flexing his emotional range here, his hunky sincerity lands in part because Sweeney remains steady in the opposite registry.

Just trust me when I say that it’s extremely clever and full of surprises, and reinforces that writer, director, and co-star James Sweeney is a bold and refreshing filmmaker to watch.
Rated: 3.5/4

Movie Madness Podcast
Dylan O’Brien does the strongest work of his career in this engrossing male relationship tale by James Sweeney who crafts interesting characters to hold our attention away from some of the contrivances of the plot.
Rated: 3/4

Culture Mix
Twinless is a compelling mix of a twist-filled psychological thriller and a wickedly dark comedy. Dylan O'Brien and James Sweeney give knockout performances as two friends who have a co-dependent relationship after meeting in group therapy.

Twinless doesn’t end up being as satisfying as Straight Up was, though it similarly manages to get us involved and empathetic towards some personalities we’d probably run screaming from in real life.

This movie had it all. Funny, heartbreaking,, an excellent script. Clever plot. Excellent performances. I knew Dylan O'Brien could play a doofus sidekick pretty well but he was just amazing in this. Kudos also to James Sweeney who wrote, directed and was the co- lead. He allowed himself to play a very flawed and at least initially unsympathetic character and he did that very well.

This is my favorite movie of the year so far - it's refreshingly original, touching, superbly directed, well acted and somehow also hilarious.
Dylan O'Brien should get all the acting nominations, he's an absolute force.
