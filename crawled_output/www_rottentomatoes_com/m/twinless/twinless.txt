In Twinless, two young men meet in a twin support group and form an unlikely friendship. Roman (Dylan O'Brien) and Dennis (James Sweeney) both search for solace and an identity without their other halves and soon become inseparable outside the group. But when Roman meets Dennis' ebullient co-worker, Marcie (Aisling Franciosi), all is revealed to be not what it seems, as each man harbors secrets that could unravel everything.

Twinless isn’t what you might expect it to be. It’s much more normal, and therefore much more haunting, than that.

Though O’Brien is flexing his emotional range here, his hunky sincerity lands in part because Sweeney remains steady in the opposite registry.

Just trust me when I say that it’s extremely clever and full of surprises, and reinforces that writer, director, and co-star James Sweeney is a bold and refreshing filmmaker to watch.
Rated: 3.5/4

Twinless doesn’t end up being as satisfying as Straight Up was, though it similarly manages to get us involved and empathetic towards some personalities we’d probably run screaming from in real life.

Few dark comedies find the tricky equilibrium required to both engage and revolt audiences, but Twinless nails the balance with subtle, though no less cringy, fury.

One of the most surprising films of the year. Dylan O'Brien continues to show how amazing an actor he is and James Sweeney's direction and writing is beautiful.

This movie had it all. Funny, heartbreaking,, an excellent script. Clever plot. Excellent performances. I knew Dylan O'Brien could play a doofus sidekick pretty well but he was just amazing in this. Kudos also to James Sweeney who wrote, directed and was the co- lead. He allowed himself to play a very flawed and at least initially unsympathetic character and he did that very well.

This is my favorite movie of the year so far - it's refreshingly original, touching, superbly directed, well acted and somehow also hilarious.
Dylan O'Brien should get all the acting nominations, he's an absolute force.
