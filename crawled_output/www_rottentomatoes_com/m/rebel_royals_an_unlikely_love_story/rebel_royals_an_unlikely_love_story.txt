Guardian
The result is, as with many Netflix documentaries de nos jours, a film that feels, if not one-sided, then not exactly brimming with editorial independence.

Decider
Within the context of the film’s ruthless grandstanding, its attempt to further normalize its subjects by detailing their struggles – i.e., the aftermath of suicide, chronic ailments – are little more than manipulations for our sympathy.

Ready Steady Cut
I’m sceptical, but then again I always am. If they’re happy, fair play to them. But one must consider the possibility that if they’re as satisfied as they claim, neither they nor we needed a documentary to convince us of it.

“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.”
The documentary uses beautiful cinematography to showcase a wealthy pocket of Los Angeles—conveniently ignoring the gritty, homeless-ridden reality that makes up 95% of the city. Derek David Verrett, AKA “Shaman Duek,” from Sacramento, has his story start in midlife, skipping over his childhood and offering no real background—crafting a false narrative with zero proof that anyone in his family ever practiced a spiritual path to earn the title “shaman.”
He’s presented as a “fourth-generation shaman” — lol — more like a modern-day Stéphane de La Faverie, the close confidant and companion to Liliane Bettencourt, heiress of the L’Oréal fortune, who famously robbed her blind.
Watching this cringeworthy documentary, it’s hard to forget you’re not actually watching a story about a conman or cult leader. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, but by the end I realized it was simply “Perception Management” — a marketing scam designed to make the world ignore its gut instincts.
Throughout the film, Duek carries himself like a diva, spending the princess’s wealth and demanding high levels of attention, while the princess seeks to heal past hurts and find freedom from the confines of her culture.

This is pure garbage, built on the egotistical views of the "Shaman" Durek.
It is disrespectful to everyone but themselves, and is ultimately a very one-sided story that should have been shelved when the Royal Family of Norway didn't want to participate.

A terrible documentary being a product of both Netflix and the couple trying make some easy money. Instead of going into details just belive me when I say "Skip it" . It's really not worth your valuable time.

Bjornis B
a one-sided and speculative Netflix documentary that lacks journalistic balance and credibility. Its portrayal of the Norwegian king is particularly problematic. he has, for years, consistently demonstrated an inclusive and respectful approach toward all citizens. Suggesting otherwise not only undermines well-documented public conduct, but also feels unjust and misleading. The documentary leans more toward insinuation than insight.
