Pacific Heights
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Michael Keaton certainly proves himself as an effective villain, but Pacific Heights sticks too closely to well-worn thriller conventions.

As a story idea, Pacific Heights has a certain appeal. The movie's problem is in its execution.

...promising (and foolproof) subject matter that’s employed to mostly engaging effect by Schlesinger...

Common Sense Media
Twenty years after his Oscar win for Midnight Cowboy, director John Schlesinger helmed this entertaining but generic psychological thriller.

Pacific Heights is not particularly notable, but it is modestly entertaining.

Keaton is a particular highlight, playing a stark opposite to his previous turn as caped crusader Batman.

Paranoiac domestic thriller with confused ideas and hackneyed clichés, but some interesting moves and frissons.

Robert M
Lawrence Kasdan's 1990 thriller Pacific Heights is a masterclass in escalating tension and psychological torment, proving that sometimes, the greatest horrors lie not in the supernatural, but in the all-too-human. From the moment young, ambitious couple Patty and Drake (Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine) purchase their dream Victorian home in the exclusive San Francisco neighborhood, a sense of foreboding subtly permeates the screen. Their decision to rent out the downstairs apartment, seemingly a practical financial move, quickly unravels into a living nightmare with the arrival of Carter Hayes, played with chillingly calm malevolence by Michael Keaton.
Keaton's performance is the undeniable centerpiece of the film. He embodies a truly unique villain – not a slasher or a maniac, but a sophisticated, calculated con artist who weaponizes the legal system and the vulnerabilities of his victims with ruthless precision. His transformation from charming prospective tenant to terrifying, immovable squatter is a slow burn, meticulously crafted to maximize the audience's frustration and fear alongside Patty and Drake's. The brilliance lies in how Hayes exploits the very laws designed to protect tenants, turning them into instruments of his own malicious design. This legal loophole aspect adds a layer of intellectual horror rarely seen in thrillers, making the audience question the very foundations of property ownership and justice.
The film excels at building suspense not through cheap jump scares, but through the relentless erosion of Patty and Drake's peace of mind. Every unexplained noise, every subtle act of defiance from Hayes, pushes them closer to their breaking point. The claustrophobia of their own home, once a symbol of their dreams, becomes a prison. Griffith and Modine deliver convincing performances as the beleaguered couple, their initial optimism slowly replaced by desperation and a simmering rage. You feel their frustration, their helplessness, and their eventual determination to reclaim their lives.
Beyond the performances, the film's production design and cinematography contribute significantly to its unsettling atmosphere. The ornate Victorian setting, initially picturesque, takes on a decaying, oppressive quality as Hayes's presence contaminates it. The narrow staircases and dimly lit hallways become conduits for dread. While some might find the ending a tad conventional, it still delivers a satisfying catharsis after the relentless psychological assault. Pacific Heights is a taut, intelligent thriller that holds up remarkably well, a testament to its strong script, superb acting, and effective direction. It's a gripping exploration of psychological warfare and the fragility of security, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.

The problem with this movie is motivation.
What is the motivation behind stealing a sink, etc., or gaining title to a very heavily mortgaged property? Doesn't everyone know that the house will be worth less with a demolished apartment with no plumbing fixtures?
How could a tenant live there, with no plumbing?
Lots of holes in this plot.
The pile of phone books is hilarious in this day and age.

This was such an engaging movie with good acting and storyline. It's one of my favorite thriller movies. Michael Keaton was excellent and sinister. It's definitely worth the watch.

Michael Keaton was very good along with rest of the cast. The story was great but the last fight scene could've been better.
