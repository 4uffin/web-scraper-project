The Age (Australia)
The moral twists that follow...have a simmer, but as soon as the plot moves onto the city’s streets the energy, in both the performances and Lee’s almost joyous camera moves, goes up a satisfying notch.
Rated: 3/5

Hard to put it in a box. It’s got weak and strong elements. But once it ends, you realize that you’ve just been entertained.
Rated: 3/4

Irish Times
The old-bloke attempts to engage with the contemporary music scene border on the embarrassing. Some of the casting is unfortunate. The film is never boring, but, once that delightful opening winds down, the action clunks where it should purr.
Rated: 2/5

One Heat Minute
It’s hip-hop thunder and velvet shadow, New York refracted into Lee angles, spaces alive with the echo of voices past and present. Washington, haunted in his apartment mausoleum moves through this false life of money and legacy with a fretful gravity.
Rated: 3.5/4

Susan Granger
SSG Syndicate
The police procedural script lacks rhythm & supporting characters lack depth/complexity. Worse yet, the self-conscious, profanity-laden, pseudo-Shakespearean rap dialogue is tiresomely repetitive during the climactic conclusion - talk about tone deaf!
Rated: 5/10

Movie Squad (RTRFM 92.1)
A fascinating formal experiment, provided the experiment was to hide 20 minutes of a really vibrant and exciting movie inside an otherwise humiliatingly bad one.
Rated: 2.5/5
