Downton Abbey brings out the snob in everyone, but it also confounds the snob in everyone: just when you think you’re above it all... someone will show someone else an unexpected kindness, and you’re a puddle again.
Rated: 4/5

Downton Abbey: A New Era is cinematic escapism at its finest and perhaps that’s all it should be.

Peter Travers
ABC News
The second film continuation of the Brit series knows it’s old-hat and out of touch. But it’s also comforting fan service and if you can shut out the real world in favor of a fantasy remembrance of things past, you’re in for a treat.

It felt like a real movie with the exotic, international locations and a storyline that required introducing technology to Abbey in a way that is simultaneously humorous and historically accurate.

Long-time fans would greet the well loved characters and the Dowager Countess’ biting commentary on the new fangled developments in the modern world with happy hugs

Loud and Clear Reviews
Downton Abbey: A New Era might not be revolutionary in its approach to its storyline, but it’s a significant improvement from its 2019 predecessor, (...), and each of these small but meaningful moments are bound to affect all audience members.
Rated: 3.5/5

Wonderful movie, touching, true to form.
Worse popcorn I have ever had.
If you are going to sell it then at least make fresh. Went to this theatre only because of the movie.
