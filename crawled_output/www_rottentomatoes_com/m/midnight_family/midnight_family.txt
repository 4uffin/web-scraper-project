What to Know
Critics Consensus
As narratively urgent as it is technically well-crafted, Midnight Family offers an enthralling and disquieting glimpse of healthcare in modern Mexico.

The Times (UK)
Mexico City has fewer than 45 official ambulances serving nine million people... Luke Lorentzen's adrenalised documentary focuses on one of the private teams that fill the gap.
Rated: 4/5

Irish Times
Packed with tense moments and disturbing shots that, without compromising the clients' privacy, hint at the unhappiness just offscreen.

With stupendous photography and a great sound design, Luke Lorentzen immerses you in a documentary that follows the Ochoa family that feels almost like a well-produced TV show... [Full review in Spanish]

Because I enjoyed (if that is the word) watching Midnight Family, I was not particularly troubled about what it’s doing or why.

This documentary portrays a very compelling argument about the perils of running a private ambulance business in the broken healthcare system in Mexico City.

One of the best doocumentary features I've ever seen. Viually astonishing and well-directed. Is a tough glance of one city night convulsions that, ven though is raw is not morbid or disrespectful in any kind. A masterfully crafted film that should be watched by everybody. This is not a film about heroes, is about people who help other people in a place where everything can happen -believe me, EVERYTHING-.
Powerfully honest and necessarily moving.

I do not know whether to say that the best of all is that it is real or that is the saddest thing. The documentary, beautiful.

Se nos muestra la realidad que se vive en la Ciudad de México; una gran falta de un buen servicio médico.

This movie is kind of a thriller. You're always asking what's happening next. It's terrifying and boring and fascinating all at the same time. All you can really say is, "poor fuckers." Driving and managing that private ambulance business looks unbelievably difficult. Must watch if only to learn how other people are living jesus christ!
