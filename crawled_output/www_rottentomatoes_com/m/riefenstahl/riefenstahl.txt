Filmmaker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl is considered one of the most controversial women of the 20th century. Her films Triumph of the Will and Olympia are defined by their fascist aesthetics, perfectly-staged body worship, and the celebration of all that is "superior" and victorious, simultaneously projecting contempt for the imperfect and weak. But Riefenstahl -- who first broke into the German film industry as an actress -- spent decades after the war denying her association with Nazi ideology, and claiming ignorance of the Holocaust. How did she become the Reich's preeminent filmmaker if she was just a hired hand? Riefenstahl examines this question using never-before-seen documents from Leni Riefenstahl's estate, including private films, photos, recordings and letters, uncovering fragments of her biography and placing them in an extended historical context. During her long life after the fall of Nazism, she remained unapologetic, managing to control and shape her legacy; in personal documents, she mourns her "murdered ideals." Meanwhile, her work would experience a renaissance, gaining esteem for its masterful technical skill. Today, Riefenstahl's aesthetics are more present than ever. Is that also true for their message? In an era where fascism is on the rise again, fake news is prevalent, and the meaning of political imagery is constantly dissected and debated, Andres Veiel's mesmerizing new film shows that Leni Reifenstahl is more relevant than ever.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Organizing a treasure trove of archival materials with impressive intellectual rigor, director Andres Veiel's documentary methodically dismantles Leni Riefenstahl's self-mythologizing to offer an historically clear-eyed assessment of her legacy.

By making a film that says there is no complicated legacy to Riefenstahl, Veiel’s uncomplicated approach, supported by Riefenstahl’s own words, is strongly rendered into a direct, inarguable slashing of Riefenstahl’s importance.
Rated: 3.5/4

Andres Veiel paints a complex and contradictory portrait.

Los Angeles Times
It answers Riefenstahl’s carefully chosen narrative, a fable of disillusioned purity, with an equally forensic counternarrative exposing her childlike narcissism about the impact of her talent.

Cinéfilo Serial
Without a narrator and with silences louder than words, this documentary gives the audience all of the tools to paint by themselves a complex and damning portrait of one of the most controversial figures in all of cinema history. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 9/10

This movie is fascinating, an unvarnished portrait full of rich archival materials in which the subject’s evident talent and intelligence, already tainted by historical context, are only devalued further by the ugliness of her personality.

EscribiendoCine
The documentary paints a portrait of an ambiguous woman: on the one hand, loyal to Hitler, stubborn, and at times even seemingly honest, at other times, her rhetoric is dismantled, and her lies are revealed, countered by the images. Full critic in spanish
Rated: 8/10

It is like thumbing through a scrapbook. The visuals in the clips are interesting, but there is very little commentary. In the end, you are left to make up your own mind about the character based on viewing the clips. There were so many things I wanted to know. Like how did she get into filmmaking? The archival material is interesting and it’s easy to form an opinion based on watching it, but I could’ve used more factual information to back up my opinion forming..

Synopsis
Filmmaker and Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl is considered one of the most controversial women of the 20th century. Her films Triumph of the Will and Olympia are defined by their fascist aesthetics, perfectly-staged body worship, and the celebration of all that is "superior" and victorious, simultaneously projecting contempt for the imperfect and weak. But Riefenstahl -- who first broke into the German film industry as an actress -- spent decades after the war denying her association with Nazi ideology, and claiming ignorance of the Holocaust. How did she become the Reich's preeminent filmmaker if she was just a hired hand? Riefenstahl examines this question using never-before-seen documents from Leni Riefenstahl's estate, including private films, photos, recordings and letters, uncovering fragments of her biography and placing them in an extended historical context. During her long life after the fall of Nazism, she remained unapologetic, managing to control and shape her legacy; in personal documents, she mourns her "murdered ideals." Meanwhile, her work would experience a renaissance, gaining esteem for its masterful technical skill. Today, Riefenstahl's aesthetics are more present than ever. Is that also true for their message? In an era where fascism is on the rise again, fake news is prevalent, and the meaning of political imagery is constantly dissected and debated, Andres Veiel's mesmerizing new film shows that Leni Reifenstahl is more relevant than ever.
