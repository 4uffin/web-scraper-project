What to Know
Critics Consensus
George Clooney riffs on his star persona with disarming vulnerability while Adam Sandler impressively expands his dramatic range in Jay Kelly, a Hollywood satire that's gentler than one might expect from director Noah Baumbach.

Kyle Smith
Wall Street Journal
Mr. Clooney and Mr. Baumbach, in a script co-written with actress Emily Mortimer, go as deep into the contradictions of movie stardom as anyone since Billy Wilder in this sometimes-transcendent comedy-drama.

Marshall Shaffer
Slant Magazine
As Noah Baumbach sells the sappiness in Jay Kelly with the same sincerity of his convictions as in his more acerbic works, the film holds together as a lightweight delight.
Rated: 2.5/4

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
Yet, thankfully, almost immediately, from a sensitive screenplay that’s co-written by the film’s director, Noah Baumbach, and the actress Emily Mortimer, the dramatic focus shifts away from luvvie nonsense...
Rated: 4/5

Film Ireland Magazine
The puzzle pieces just don’t fit. Clooney gives a convincing performance, but the narrative is pulled in too many different directions.

Clotilde Chinnici
FILMHOUNDS Magazine
With a poignant reminder that not all that glitters is gold, and pain is a necessary part of life whether we like it or not, Jay Kelly encourages the audience to embrace it and focus on the memories and the people that really mattered
Rated: 5/5

Walter Chaw
Film Freak Central
Jay Kelly wants to preserve the inviolability of its sacred cake and eat it, too. It wants to be a bruising study of a failed man and an unironic celebration of a great artist. I don’t think you can do both of those things.
Rated: 1/4
