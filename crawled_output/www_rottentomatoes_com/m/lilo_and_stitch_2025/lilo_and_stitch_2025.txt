Lilo & Stitch
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Recapturing the adorable charm of the original if not quite matching its rambunctious sense of imagination, Lilo & Stitch emerges out of the crate as one of the better live-action remakes of a Disney classic.

In theory, I should be pro-change... except that Lilo & Stitch doesn’t really commit to its big alterations.

Empire Magazine
Fleischer Camp brings a light touch and a good human cast to this reverently faithful effort, but it’s never as clear and bright as its source material.
Rated: 3/5

Jake Wilson
Sydney Morning Herald
The director Dean Fleischer Camp isn’t trying to recapture the arthouse audience who went for the sophisticated faux-naivety of his 2021 Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. But he does ground the whimsy in a baseline level of realism...
Rated: 3/5

Mac the Movie Guy
While it doesn’t make a case for longevity, Lilo and Stitch is entertaining enough to justify the curiosity of seeing for yourself if this Ohana can be a part of your family. probably not, but it is worth a shot.

We may not have needed a live-action version of Lilo & Stitch, but at least it keeps the spirit of ‘Ohana’ alive through a product that blends nostalgia with a fresh appeal to new generations. [Full Review in Spanish]

Every part of this film provided that same sense of ohana and warmness I felt as a kid, if not more.

I wanted to escape my kids acting up only to see Lilo & Stitch get yelled at for 2 hours! I could've stayed home and yelled at them for free.
