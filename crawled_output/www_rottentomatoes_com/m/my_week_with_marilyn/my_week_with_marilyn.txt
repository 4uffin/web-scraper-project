Marilyn is also honeymooning with her new husband, playwright Arthur Miller, but the combined pressure of work and the demands of the Hollywood hangers-on is driving her to exhaustion. When Miller departs for Paris, Colin seizes the opportunity, to give Marilyn respite during a week in the idyllic British countryside.

My Week With Marilyn is a compelling look at Marilyn Monroe's insecurities - but Michelle Williams doesn't fully convince as the film legend.

This is a trifle of a film about a trifle of a film. But trifles can be appealing, especially English trifles, and this one is no exception.

I believe the heart of the film, and the cleverest stroke of all, is Eddie Redmayne as Colin Clark, someone few of us will have heard of.

We are given a glowing portrait of the bright and awestruck Marilyn Monroe with shades of her future descent.

Williams makes the most of her underwritten role by giving a performance that proves to be the film’s raison d’être.

Great film that takes on Marylin Monroe. Shows some of Marylin's love and sorrow towards others and her struggles through her immaculate career.

I watched this on DVD recently. I was expecting not to like it, but to my surprise I really did. The story is thoroughly engaging, and the acting is first rate, which results in a very compelling and enjoyable film. It felt very authentic, and it was fascinating to see how films used to be made at Pinewood studios, which I imagine is nothing like how modern films are made now. I don't know much about Marilyn Monroe, so I take what is shown of her at face value, but she certainly seems to have been a colourful character. I recommend this film, and would suggest to anyone to give it a watch, even if you think it"s not your thing.

A surprisingly good movie! Michelle Williams is perfect casting for Marilyn, the most alluring vamp ever. There's not much plot or suspense, but it's forgotten in the Marilyn
field, where she shows what gave her the star power she had. I probably won't watch it again but I'm glad I watched it once.

Michelle Williams steals every scene she is in as Marilyn Monroe and really gives an insight as to what made the actress so compelling in the first place.

Film gradevole, soprattutto grazie alla sua velocità e ai caratteri dei personaggi molto ironici con uno stile molto vicino a quello di Wes Anderson.
Marylin come anche nella sua vita, viene utilizzata in diverse scene come musa, mentre il vero protagonista si inerpica per trovare successo tra mille peripezie e difficoltà.
Nel finale si entra più all'interno della personalità dell'attrice, seppure senza mai trovare una grande profondità; nonostante la bella prova della Williams.
Nel complesso un estratto di un periodo di breve durata molto intenso e divertente.
