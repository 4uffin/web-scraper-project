The Limey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Crafted with eccentric moodiness and style by Steven Soderbergh, The Limey is also a gritty neo-noir showcase for the talent of leading man Terence Stamp.

Chuck Bowen
Slant Magazine
The Limey is one of many American films released in 1999 that seemed to be saying goodbye to the rebel spirit that allowed indies and mainstream movies to comingle as they had in the ’70s.

Emanuel Levy
Variety
The crimer suffers from a slim, underdeveloped script by Lem Dobbs (who also write Kafka), but benefits from Soderbergh's astute direction that posits two 1960s cinematic icons, Brit Terrence Stamp and American Peter Fonda as long-time enemies.
Rated: B+

Those interested in more challenging work will find the film a unique meditation on the nature of Hollywood.

It’s like the original 'Get Carter' channeled through 'Point Blank,' a hard-edged revenge thriller steeped in sorrow and regret.

A Good Movie To Watch
The bare bones of The Limey’s story are gripping enough [...] but what Steven Soderbergh does with them elevates this neo-noir thriller into something utterly singular and stacked with layers upon layers of meaning.

Jason Shawhan
Nashville Scene
It's a brisk and relentless story, with a killer supporting cast (Lesley Anne Warren, Joe Dallesandro, Nicky Katt and Luis Guzmán!) and an inevitability that you feel in every cut. Truly one of the great films of 1999.

Neo noir done to perfection. Soderbergh directs this with expected aplom and Stamp provides a towering central performance. Stamp has done some world class films as well as some dross but when he was called upon by a proper director and script he could deliver with the absolute best.

Filme fraco, o roteiro é fraco, as cenas são fracas, a história é fraca, o elenco é fraco, e ninguém ajuda a melhorar o filme, os personagens são fracos, e o filme deveria ter cenas bem melhores e relevantes, para fazer o filme ser bom

Soderbergh has made some great films.
Out of Sight is one of my favorites.
This film is by a younger Soderbergh with still a lot to learn.
The pacing is awful and the cuts are not well done.
Soderbergh tries scene repitition a number of times to create tension and fails miserably. Unless you are a big enough Terence Stamp fan that you want to enjoy endless minutes of closeups of him looking pensive, give this snoozer a pass.

Either a crafted black comedy for anyone who is native to the UK, or an edgy revenge thriller to everyone else.
The "dumbed-down for an American audience script" really takes away from the effectiveness of the lead actors authenticity as a London East-end
cockney and ex-con. In that respect it comes over as a parody of the classic film, Get Carter (the original version, not the remake).
It was a shame such great actors on such a poor film.
