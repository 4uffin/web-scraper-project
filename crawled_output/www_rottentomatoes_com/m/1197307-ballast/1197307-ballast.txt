Critics Consensus
A searing debut by director Lance Hammer, this subtle and contemplative Mississippi set drama lingers long after its conclusion.

The opening half hour is electrifying, the ending interestingly open-ended...

Tim Robey
Daily Telegraph (UK)
Quite a debut here from writer-director Lance Hammer, working on a minuscule budget in the Mississippi Delta, and evoking a memorably forlorn kind of regional specificity.
Rated: 4/5

A difficult, subdued film, but intelligent and with more intricacy and subtlety than at first appears.
Rated: 3/5

The storyline is direct and the characters well-sketched. The film revolves around the impact of a suicide on the family of a convenience store owner.

This moving debut effort combines edgy camerawork, a stark story and a cast of inspired non-professionals.

Blistering indie about a kid drawn in by a drug gang, his mother trying to juggle working and keeping her son from the drug culture, all within the quiet of rural Missouri bleakness.
A bit confusing at the start, and a missed opportunity to be elliptical in the end, it never lags, and it draws you in to the point you can't look away.
These pensive characters offer unspoken complexities, and a part of you knows this is thinly veiled reality. The organic nature of the narrative its almost stunning to observe.
Tho not as intensely volatile as Winter's Bone w Jennifer Lawrence - a MUST SEE - but with the same style and veracity. There is also a measure of New Jersey Drive gang mentality thrown in, and no one is safe.
A solid work from a first time director.

The prevalent theme is the feeling of sadness. But there are many other minute details of the hard and rough life, broken relations, gangs, drugs and violence. All the people in the films are totally non-professionals. There is no use of background music and no artificial lighting either. The deserted lackluster landscape and surroundings add to the feeling of sadness of the characters themselves. Above all it is also a profound character study.

Intricate, detailed and beautifully filmed. You are captivated by the images and dark colours from the opening scene leaving you to thirst for more. The depth of the characters and the performances from the cast pulls you right in. A near perfect drama.

A "searing, subtle and contemplative debut"? Maybe, if you're a white critic plagued by some sense of suburban white guilt and too scared to say "It's boring, and the characters are annoying."
Beautifully shot, though.

Heartbreaking and realistic.
Watching this, it's hard to believe that we all live in the same country.
That people like this live out their lives underneath the very same nation we are a part of. Anyway, this film is so understated and so well-done and so disturbing and surprising, it's a shame if you don't see it.
So go see it.
