Academy Award®-winning director Danny Boyle and Academy Award®-nominated writer Alex Garland reunite for 28 Years Later, a terrifying new "auteur horror" story set in the world created by 28 Days Later. It's been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.

Classy, arty, horror. Good enough for genre fans. Mature enough for grownups. More than enough.
Rated: 3/4

Filmspotting
If you feared Boyle and Garland might play it safe with their now-seemingly-precious IP, 28 Years Later sufficiently proves otherwise. There’s enough creative gristle to chew on and more than enough to stoke curiosity for what’s next.
Rated: 4/5

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
I don't know that I was ever scared... but I was never bored. Danny Boyle knows how to do this stuff.

The Blu Spot
28 Years Later is a rather curious start of a supposed trilogy in that it does a fine job of establishing its characters, but not so much in terms of giving the film enough substance in regards to its strangely weak narrative.
Rated: 2.5/5

Splice Today
Tucked away amidst the screaming and the blood, this is a remarkably affecting story about living with disappointment, death, and irrecoverable loss.

Blake Howard
One Heat Minute
I wasn’t ready for the slow, crushing force of 28 Years Later, the sensation of being steamrolled like some doomed Austin Powers henchman, flattened by a film that insists on life even as it stages the apocalyptic end of it.
Rated: 4/4

Great starting sequence and early set up with the main character exploring the mainland with his father. I was less impressed with the second journey with the mother but still overall satisfied and looking forward to the sequel
