Kenji Fujishima
Slant Magazine
While its desire to question absolutes is admirable, there’s a hollowness at the film’s core that prevents it from having a more pointed impact beyond surface provocation.
Rated: 2/4

Siddhant Adlakha
Observer
The star-studded After the Hunt has a lot on its mind about human complexities, but largely expresses these notions in didactic form and through dramatic conflict that all but resolves itself halfway through the movie’s languid 2 hours and 18 minutes.
Rated: 2/4

Sight & Sound
Maggie becomes the unwieldy avatar for everything Gen-X doesn’t get about Gen-Z — which is, apparently, everything — with the blank incomprehension regarding the younger generation amounting to disdain...

Medium Popcorn
This was 20 minutes too long, the tone was incredibly inconsistent, and ultimately this didn't really say anything about any of the heavy themes it introduced. I'm not sure who the audience for this is...
Rated: 2/5

Twists and turns are welcome in films, but overdoing them can leave the audience confused. Having some answers is always appreciated, but it’s frustrating when the film provides few resolutions.

Rubén Romero Santos
Cinemanía (Spain)
Guadagnino presents us with a world without God, in which blame falls solely and exclusively on the shoulders of mortals, or rather, the mortals who occupy the university classrooms. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 4/5
