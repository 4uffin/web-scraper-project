A Big Bold Beautiful Journey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Too solemn to have much fun with its high concept while also too saccharine for its wistful themes to resonate, this well-meaning odyssey never quite lives up to its title.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
The dividends of this Journey may depend on how much of A Big Bold Beautiful cheese your stomach can tolerate, but for those seeking vibrant colors and heart, it may pay in spades.

It's a drama about love, loss and the fear of commitment, with a let's-go-on-an-adventure twist, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by way of The Phantom Tollbooth. I wish it were remotely as good as that sounds.

NPR
The stars struggle to make their dialogue sound credible, and director Kogonada is stymied by generic, cloying, situational twaddle that cannot possibly have looked any smarter on paper than it does on screen.

Not knowing what’s going to happen next doesn’t necessarily mean a movie will be good, but it helps -- and sure is refreshing. There’s a fair amount of emotional gear-shifting, but “Journey” gets away with it.
Rated: 3/4

A Big, Bold, Beautiful Journey feels untethered from any kind of emotional truth or reality. It is a simulacrum molded in the vague shape of “romance,” but it’s just a glossy, plastic surface that’s completely hollow on the inside.

The film does look beautiful, as do its stars, but there's not enough going on inside.

I loved this movie! It was different from your typical “Hollywood” film. I found it to be a lovely story, and I found it to be more of an artsy film. I would put this movie in the same category as The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Map of Tiny Perfect Things.

PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE if you’re on the fence because of the mixed reviews, especially if you’re not too young. It’s unique. It’s profound. It feels like therapy, connecting your past and present. It’s about those defining moments in life, about bonding, and about learning to let people in. It’s just so touching.
I absolutely LOVED it. It’s beautifully made, with superb performances from Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell. I have always love Margot Robbie’s acting and charisma , was once concerned because of the mixed reviews, but absolutely enjoy it throughout after watching the movie. Not just the acting, the music and
cinematography are outstanding.
This is the kind of film you may either love or not connect with, but it truly deserves a chance. It’s a solid movie. Go see it—you might find yourself enjoying it as much as I did. There are still many moviegoers enjoyed and vouched for this well-crafted original movies.
GIVE IT A CHANCE.
