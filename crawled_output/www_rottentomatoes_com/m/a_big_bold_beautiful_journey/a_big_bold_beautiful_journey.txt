A Big Bold Beautiful Journey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Too solemn to have much fun with its high concept while also too saccharine for its wistful themes to resonate, this well-meaning odyssey never quite lives up to its title.

The Nightly (AU)
The film is laden with schmaltz without offering anything that hasn’t already been pinned to thousands of Pinterest boards. Live, laugh, love!
Rated: 2/5

Tribune News Service
What should be a tearjerker and a moving story about learning to be open to life’s surprises doesn’t have much more impact than a beautifully rendered inspirational Instagram quote.
Rated: 2/4

In the pantheon of films about magical cars, this one is not big, bold or beautiful.

A Big Bold Beautiful Journey finds a way to tell a natural, coherent love story of epic proportions that just barely keeps from flying away to farce and folly.

Film Feeder
It has two competing visions getting in the way of one another and turning something that should have been easy to comprehend into an incoherent and over-indulgent mess which can’t make heads or tails of itself.

It was an interesting movie. The two had great chemistry on stage, and the plot made you feel and reflect. I thought the acting was superb and both main characters were funny and charming while bouncing back and forth between their own levels of sabotage and cynicism.
