A Big Bold Beautiful Journey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Too solemn to have much fun with its high concept while also too saccharine for its wistful themes to resonate, this well-meaning odyssey never quite lives up to its title.

What should be a tearjerker and a moving story about learning to be open to life’s surprises doesn’t have much more impact than a beautifully rendered inspirational Instagram quote.

In the pantheon of films about magical cars, this one is not big, bold or beautiful.

Rolling Stone
Excuse the cynicism, but this is the sort of combination of touchy-feely button-pushing and self-conscious peculiarity that’s meant to seem significant and profound that will bring out your inner rom-com Grinch.

A Big Bold Beautiful Journey finds a way to tell a natural, coherent love story of epic proportions that just barely keeps from flying away to farce and folly.

Film Feeder
It has two competing visions getting in the way of one another and turning something that should have been easy to comprehend into an incoherent and over-indulgent mess which can’t make heads or tails of itself.

Miscast for the male role too slow in pace- the audience got it after the first 30 minutes then it became redundant and predictable. Too bad- because I like the idea of the plot

This is not a romantic comedy. This is a story about 2 lost individuals coming together on a journey to find themselves. It's incredibly relatable.
Dont go in expecting the standard Hollywood fanfare.
