A Big Bold Beautiful Journey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Too solemn to have much fun with its high concept while also too saccharine for its wistful themes to resonate, this well-meaning odyssey never quite lives up to its title.

Audience Says
The dividends of this Journey may depend on how much of A Big Bold Beautiful cheese your stomach can tolerate, but for those seeking vibrant colors and heart, it may pay in spades.

It's a drama about love, loss and the fear of commitment, with a let's-go-on-an-adventure twist, like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by way of The Phantom Tollbooth. I wish it were remotely as good as that sounds.

The stars struggle to make their dialogue sound credible, and director Kogonada is stymied by generic, cloying, situational twaddle that cannot possibly have looked any smarter on paper than it does on screen.

Not knowing what’s going to happen next doesn’t necessarily mean a movie will be good, but it helps -- and sure is refreshing. There’s a fair amount of emotional gear-shifting, but “Journey” gets away with it.
Rated: 3/4

Flickering Myth
Even though the filmmaker is actively trying not to do so, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is more of a big, sappy pile of mush
Rated: 2.5/5

Has the vibe of an undergraduate student play … Nothing in this felt original. Even the title annoyed me; it just reminded me of other films with long titles which handle the fantasy material with much more authority and sophistication.

We really liked the story, but the movie had a lot of unnecessary cussing. It was distracting from the overall movie and offensive as well. The movie would have been much better without the foul language.

Unfortunately, I was unable to go to the 1:30 p.m. showing due to my husband having a procedure in the Military Hospital and his surgery was delayed from 8:30 a.m. to 2:15 p.m., so will have to catch it on television. Husband always comes first.
Hopefully it was good.
