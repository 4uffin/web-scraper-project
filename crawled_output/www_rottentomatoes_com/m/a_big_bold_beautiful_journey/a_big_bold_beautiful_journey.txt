A Big Bold Beautiful Journey
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Too solemn to have much fun with its high concept while also too saccharine for its wistful themes to resonate, this well-meaning odyssey never quite lives up to its title.

The film is laden with schmaltz without offering anything that hasn’t already been pinned to thousands of Pinterest boards. Live, laugh, love!
Rated: 2/5

What should be a tearjerker and a moving story about learning to be open to life’s surprises doesn’t have much more impact than a beautifully rendered inspirational Instagram quote.
Rated: 2/4

In the pantheon of films about magical cars, this one is not big, bold or beautiful.

You know that urge, when you meet your person, to pour your entire life into them because you're afraid of being the only one who truly knows who you are. This is it. A romantic Christmas Carol if that makes any sense. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

Sarah McIntyre
RTÉ (Ireland)
Sure, some of it is a bit overwrought, and it is too long in the middle act. ...But if you're willing to surrender to the sheer romance and unapologetic gorgeousness of it all - it's an expedition worth embarking on.
Rated: 3.5/5

he whimsical magic evident early on grows stale. The movie’s tone is herky-jerky and never settles. And the ending feels undercooked and unearned.

The positives of this movie are obviously the two leads. The cast is pleasing to see in one place, but the overall feel of the movie is not something Id ever be interested in rewatching.

Very delightful, a bit on the nose at times - but it's a fantasy. Funny and sweet.
It's beautifully shot as well.
