Seamlessly recreating one of cinema's most groundbreaking productions, Nouvelle Vague doesn't reinvent the medium the way its subjects did, but it pays tribute to their accomplishment with infectious admiration.

AARP Movies for Grownups
With a perfectly cast group as bold-faced names in that epochal film era, the movie is delightful and vibrant, rekindling a love of cinema without reducing the past to a bug in amber.
Rated: 5/5

Guillaume Marbeck (who never removes his sunglasses and rarely stops smoking) is priceless as the filmmaker.

Among film types, there is perhaps no greater love language than sharing the art that speaks to you. Linklater not only pays his respects to Godard but also shares that adoration for his craft with his own audience.
Rated: 3/4

Alfred Castaneda
Shade Studios
Linklater’s ode to the movement that forged modern cinema is like stepping into a nostalgic time machine that only has one destination: Godard’s set in Paris, back in 1959.

Flickering Myth
Nouvelle Vague is an enjoyable, charming and heartfelt film dedicated to the New Wave and what Godard and his colleagues did for the film industry.
