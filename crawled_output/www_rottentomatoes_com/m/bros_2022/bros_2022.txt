Universal Pictures proudly presents the first romantic comedy from a major studio about two gay men maybe, possibly, probably, stumbling towards love. Maybe. They're both very busy. From the ferocious comic mind of Billy Eichner and the hitmaking brilliance of filmmakers Nicholas Stoller and Judd Apatow, comes Bros, a smart, swoony and heartfelt comedy about finding sex, love and romance amidst the madness.

Eichner hits most of the right notes, lovingly lambasting queer culture, but this movie follows too many of the same romcom tropes as its heterosexual contemporaries.
Rated: 3/5

Observer (UK)
For the most part, it works rather well – a ribald and riotous onslaught of bracing humour which belies a sweetly soft centre.
Rated: 3/5

It’s a proper, laugh-out-loud comedy which have you gasping for breath one minute and hands clapped over your mouth the next – yes, they went there.
Rated: 4/5

I wanted to fall in love with Bros. And I did love a lot of it. The film is beautiful to look at. The chemistry between the actors is undeniable. But it relies on too many clichés and the protagonist isn’t likeable, nor does he learn from his mistakes.

Boston Hassle
The film shines best when the humor is sour and negative, which is essentially when Eichner is making fun and is being made fun of. However, I think the film loses steam because it doesn’t work as a romantic comedy.
Rated: 2/5

Juan Pablo Russo
EscribiendoCine
Beyond its historical value, the movie is relevant because it puts characters at the center of its narrative who have rarely been the protagonists in mainstream love stories. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10
