Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Boston Globe
It‚Äôs not as fall-down funny nor as fresh as the original, but there are enough chuckles and musical performances to make this sequel worth seeing.
Rated: 3/4

The Times (UK)
... it seemingly hopes that the sight of our beloved trio gathered together, mostly on chairs and improvising badly, will be enough in itself. The results, alas, are less The Majesty of Rock and more Shit Sandwich.
Rated: 2/5

Thankfully, nothing in ‚ÄúSpinal Tap II‚Äù will kill off the original‚Äôs legacy. It‚Äôs just a nostalgia lap you wish had more 11.

Terry Staunton
Radio Times
Consequently, rather than enriching or adding to the Tap pantheon, the movie is best approached as an exercise in nostalgia that relies on an audience with a ready-made, unwavering affection for the band.
Rated: 3/5

Does it live up to the original?... Not quite, but there are enough moments that rock out to make it a modest good time.

As funny as they are loud, these metal gods have actually improved with age.

A sequel that was absolutely unnecessary, but definitely needed.
Is this going to call in people who aren‚Äôt already fans? Probably not, but if you‚Äôre a fan of This Is Spinal Tap, this is a wonderful after meal dessert.
Most of this film is unscripted, like the entirety of the original‚Äôs dialogue. The bits that are scripted are the only ones that pull you out of this for a split second.
I found myself singing and even crying with this imaginary band of talent. Long Live Tap!ü§òüèºüá¨üáß

Ive been looking forward to this movie for 6 months and it did not disappoint.
It was hilarious and exceeded my expectations.
If you are a fan of the original you will love it.
The laughs were plentiful so I would highly recommend seeing this movie.

I was nervous going in. The first movie is one of my favorites and I was kind of bracing for a cameo filled run around the block of nostalgia. This was anything but. The premise made sense, the cameos were tasteful, believable, and way funnier than I thought theyd be. The core of the movie was the characters and the music, 40 years later. Is it funny? Its actually funnier than the first if youre just going by joke meter. The first movie is not a laugh riot. Its hilarious in its own way, as is this one. Its a worthy follow up and Im glad they went for it.
