Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

It’s not as fall-down funny nor as fresh as the original, but there are enough chuckles and musical performances to make this sequel worth seeing.

The Times (UK)
... it seemingly hopes that the sight of our beloved trio gathered together, mostly on chairs and improvising badly, will be enough in itself. The results, alas, are less The Majesty of Rock and more Shit Sandwich.

Thankfully, nothing in “Spinal Tap II” will kill off the original’s legacy. It’s just a nostalgia lap you wish had more 11.

Spinal Tap’s extended victory tour would be more acceptable if this film had tried to include more actual jokes. There are a couple of gags here and there, but nowhere near enough to pad out a feature-length runtime.

While Spinal Tap II: The End Continues brings heavy nostalgia and a parade of cameos, the sequel struggles to match the inspired brilliance that made the original a classic.

This was a good sequel to the original movie.
Very fun but not as many memorable lines as in the original.
Any fan of the original will enjoy this film.

Had a lot of nostalgia for sure it just didn't capture the magic or humor of the original. Not bad by any means, but much of it felt uneven.

I'm a huge Spinal Tap fan but sadly, this movie missed. Not enough humor the movie was flat.
There were a few (too few) funny moments, but not enough to save it, despite cameos from Paul McCartney and Elton John.

I'm a fan of the first film having watched it dozens of times since the 1980's.
The film was made in the same exact manner as the original using the quick cutaways and improvised scenes.
As with the original this film doesn't give it all to you at once, so I predict it will ripen as it ages.
It's main theme is aging for not only the main characters, but the sunset for our real classic rock heroes and an entire generation of music as well.
This will be the film's strongest legacy because of the clever ways it presents this.
While it's not on that topic expect the usual interaction in the scenes like was presented in the first film.
A few mic drops were captured that probably will go over most people's heads in the first showing, but will be memorized and appreciated like the first film.
The cameos of modern day stars were great as well as the effort made to get some of the original supporting characters in the film.
In all this effort the film remarkably accomplished being a love letter to the first picture, the genre, it's own great music, and classic rock as a whole all at the same time.
Well well done.
