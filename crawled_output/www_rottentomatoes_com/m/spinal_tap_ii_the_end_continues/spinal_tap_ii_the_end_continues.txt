Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

This reunion could‚Äôve all been cringe-worthy, but Spinal Tap was never exactly about dignity, was it? Still, there are sufficient laughs and a wistful, honest reckoning with aging... It‚Äôs stupidly sincere. Or sincerely stupid. Take your pick.
Rated: 3.5/5

Sydney Morning Herald
One of the many joys of the first film was its typically flawed array of backstage operators facilitating ‚Äì and hindering ‚Äì the band‚Äôs progress. There are fewer this time, but they make their mark.
Rated: 4/5

It‚Äôs not as fall-down funny nor as fresh as the original, but there are enough chuckles and musical performances to make this sequel worth seeing.
Rated: 3/4

ABC Radio (Australia)
Spinal Tap was such a cultural phenomenon, so how can a sequel possibly top it? The joke is that it‚Äôs the same: everyone‚Äôs here, but they‚Äôre much older. ‚Ä¶ [And] I found myself craving the kind of stupidity that Spinal Tap can offer.

Spinal Tap's secret sauce has always been that the songs, though daft, are actually good.

Mad About Movies Podcast
Unnecessary but also inoffensive in its existence. There are some real laughs but the involvement of a Fred Armisen or Bill Hader, someone with a fresher sense of humor, would have made the whole thing work better.

If you loved Spinal Tap, you will like this movie.
While the original was better, this was still an entertaining follow-up with lots of nods to the original movie.
Bonus points for the cameos by some very famous musicians, and Valerie Franco rocked as their newest drummer.

Not only really funny, with great acting but the music is great, too.
And the secondary characters are as well drawn and well done as the major ones.
Then ad star turns by Paul McCartney and Elton John and it's all pretty great.
