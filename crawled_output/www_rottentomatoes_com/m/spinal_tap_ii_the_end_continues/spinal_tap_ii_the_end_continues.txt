Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

It’s funny and a wee bit poignant, and the main trio has the good taste not to ask us to feel too deeply about three guys whose chief appeal is that they’re miserable and petty and witheringly sarcastic and don’t try to hide it.
Rated: 3/4

Little White Lies
At best, this is a late-period diversion that most fans will either ignore or try to forget, while at worst, it does reach the point where you feel as if it might be actively working against the band’s legacy.
Rated: 1/5

This collection of tired jokes is enough to prompt the question, “What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap II: The End Continues, and couldn’t he have rested on that day too?”

The band's not in its prime anymore, but it sure feels good to hear them play the hits one more time.

Epoch Times
For returning director and co-writer Rob Reiner, “The End” is just the latest in a long line of painfully embarrassing clunkers dating back to 1994, beginning with the abysmal “North.” Prior to that, Reiner was on an amazing winning streak.
Rated: 2/5

“Spinal Tap: The End Continues” keeps the momentum going with a story that’s not trying to retread on the past, and isn’t interested in cheap nostalgia jokes by making a story for the band set in this time.

Plenty of laugh out loud scenes. If you liked the original movie, ignore any lukewarm reviews by critics that you may have read.
This goes to show you its possible to pack a lot into a one hour 23 minute movie.

As with most sequels, it was not as good as the first (nor did I expect it to be), but it was still funny and good! It also had some good cameos, a couple of which made me say "wow!"

I wanted more concert scenes. The movie ended too soon. I loved all the banter between everyone and the jokes. Also, the cameos of Fran Dresher and others could have been longer. I'm a die-hard Spinal Tap fan 🤪
