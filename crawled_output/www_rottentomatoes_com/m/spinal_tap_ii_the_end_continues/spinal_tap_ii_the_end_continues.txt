Forty-one years after the release of the groundbreaking mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the now estranged bandmates David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer) are forced to reunite for one final concert. Spinal Tap II: The End Continues also marks the resurrection of documentarian Marty Di Bergi (Rob Reiner), who once again tries to capture his favorite metal gods as they contemplate mortality--and the hope that their 12th drummer doesn't join them in The Great Beyond. Joined by music royalty Paul McCartney and Elton John, Spinal Tap wrestles with their checkered past to put on a concert that they hope will solidify their place in the pantheon of rock 'n' roll.

Spinal Tap II: The End Continues
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Getting the band back together for an encore, Spinal Tap II's dry sense of humor doesn't reach the heights of the original's comedic brilliance but still hits the right nostalgia chords while wisely acting its own age.

Sydney Morning Herald
One of the many joys of the first film was its typically flawed array of backstage operators facilitating – and hindering – the band’s progress. There are fewer this time, but they make their mark.
Rated: 4/5

Boston Globe
It’s not as fall-down funny nor as fresh as the original, but there are enough chuckles and musical performances to make this sequel worth seeing.
Rated: 3/4

The Times (UK)
... it seemingly hopes that the sight of our beloved trio gathered together, mostly on chairs and improvising badly, will be enough in itself. The results, alas, are less The Majesty of Rock and more Shit Sandwich.
Rated: 2/5

Mad About Movies Podcast
Unnecessary but also inoffensive in its existence. There are some real laughs but the involvement of a Fred Armisen or Bill Hader, someone with a fresher sense of humor, would have made the whole thing work better.

The List
The classic songs, like ‘Big Bottoms’, sound as good as ever, but with no new music and nods to old gags like the Stonehenge stage set, this just feels like an ageing rock band cashing in.
Rated: 2/5

Not only really funny, with great acting but the music is great, too.
And the secondary characters are as well drawn and well done as the major ones.
Then ad star turns by Paul McCartney and Elton John and it's all pretty great.

Hilarious!

The forever Kings of the Mockumentary. It was great to catch up with Spinal Tap (and several familiar faces from the Christopher Guest stable of artists), and the laughs were most definitely still there. The premise was solid, the cameos were hilarious, and the new characters held their own. I was kind of hoping to hear more new music, but given the storyline, it made sense. With a less than 90 minute run time, I would definitely recommend seeing it at matinee prices. But I really loved it.
