'Looking Through Water' wants to tell us about the importance of uncluttered connections to the natural world and to each other, but too often it ignores its own advice.
Rated: 2.5/4

“Think about what kind of men you really are,” urges salty bar owner Miss Reno (Tamara Tunie), her words speaking to the thematic strengths in the script by Zach Dean and Rowdy Herrington (yes, that Rowdy Herrington!)
Rated: 3.5/5

Collider
This elementary-level approach to stories about fractured families is all well and good if you just want 90 minutes of fluff, but often by design, such setups really require a more serious approach for any real depth to be reached.
Rated: 6/10

This drama has a solid story and will leave viewers who love gentle family stories satisfied enough.

A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father–son stories.

“Looking Through Water” could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.

Mr. Hollywood
Better than I thought it would be. Felt for the characters. We are all here for a small amount of time and no one is perfect, we all make mistakes that we regret. A film that explains this nicely and tries not to judge

The movie covers so many important topics and the characters are relatable.
It’s rare to find a movie that captures father / son / brother issues and struggles like this does.
The scenery and fishing have you ready to book your flight to Belize ( or the Florida Keys).
The love story is also very sweet but not the central force of the movie.
Many key parenting lines ( love the grandson coming to terms and enjoying time with his grandfather).
Catch this movie while you can!!

The script showed depth in the characters personalities. My friends are I enjoyed this movie immensely. The movie was funny at times , sad and joyful. David Morse has always been one of all our favorite actors and he came through once again as well as all the other great actors
in this movie. I don’t like to compare movies but it has the same feelings you got when we watched When the Crawdads Sing. You never wanted the movie to end.

Lovely movie in beautiful setting. Interesting dramatic plot twists. Feel-good without being sappy. Some very good acting. Michael Douglas is excellent.
A memorably charming movie experience.
