'Looking Through Water' wants to tell us about the importance of uncluttered connections to the natural world and to each other, but too often it ignores its own advice.
Rated: 2.5/4

“Think about what kind of men you really are,” urges salty bar owner Miss Reno (Tamara Tunie), her words speaking to the thematic strengths in the script by Zach Dean and Rowdy Herrington (yes, that Rowdy Herrington!)
Rated: 3.5/5

Collider
This elementary-level approach to stories about fractured families is all well and good if you just want 90 minutes of fluff, but often by design, such setups really require a more serious approach for any real depth to be reached.
Rated: 6/10

A predictable drama, failing to capture the vulnerability and forgiveness that define better father–son stories.
Rated: 3/10

“Looking Through Water” could use a bit more energy and intensity, but for those searching for something easy on the senses, the movie might work with its nonconfrontational ways.

Mr. Hollywood
Better than I thought it would be. Felt for the characters. We are all here for a small amount of time and no one is perfect, we all make mistakes that we regret. A film that explains this nicely and tries not to judge

Lovely movie in beautiful setting. Interesting dramatic plot twists. Feel-good without being sappy. Some very good acting. Michael Douglas is excellent.
A memorably charming movie experience.

Just saw this film last night. Much better than I expected. Great cast and very well done. Thoroughly enjoyed. It reminded me of an old favorite film “On Golden Pond” that also dealt with family relationship struggles. I highly recommend seeing it.
