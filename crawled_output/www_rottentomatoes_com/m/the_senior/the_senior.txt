At 59, Mike Flynt may be too old to be on a college football field, but not too old to feel the weight of unfinished business. After nearly four decades, he returns to his alma mater to take the hit that changed everything. Bruised, doubted, and nearly broken, he pushes for one more game, not for glory, but for the teammates he lost, the family he fractured, and the ending he still believes is possible.

Owen Gleiberman
Variety
It’s basically a soft-hearted paint-by-numbers TV-movie, stocked with homilies about the game of football vs. the game of life. Yet it’s an effective soft-hearted paint-by-numbers TV-movie.

No surprises here, but nobody really wants surprises in a fact-based underdog comeback story. What we want is stakes, a flawed but sympathetic hero, and maybe a bit of wish fulfillment for anyone who’d like a do-over. On those, it crosses the goal line.
Rated: 3/4

You can simply surrender yourself to the bland moral lessons of the movie, but even then, it’s hard not to feel like this was best left as a quirky human interest segment on a slow news day.

Michael Chiklis is fantastic as a man struggling with his demons....and how being on this team helps him come to terms with his past. This is a good, family friendly movie that you can see at theaters.
Rated: 8/10

There is no shortage of the cliches familiar to the genre, but in this engaging and winning tale they all seem just fine. Why not? It’s real.

Works because it strove for authenticity, and Michael Chiklis delivers the soul as the title character. There are six ways to football Sunday to screw up a film like this, but very few ways to make it work, and the production found that way. Daddy issues!
Rated: 4.5/5
