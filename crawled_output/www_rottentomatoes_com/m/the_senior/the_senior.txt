At 59, Mike Flynt may be too old to be on a college football field, but not too old to feel the weight of unfinished business. After nearly four decades, he returns to his alma mater to take the hit that changed everything. Bruised, doubted, and nearly broken, he pushes for one more game, not for glory, but for the teammates he lost, the family he fractured, and the ending he still believes is possible.

It’s basically a soft-hearted paint-by-numbers TV-movie, stocked with homilies about the game of football vs. the game of life. Yet it’s an effective soft-hearted paint-by-numbers TV-movie.

No surprises here, but nobody really wants surprises in a fact-based underdog comeback story. What we want is stakes, a flawed but sympathetic hero, and maybe a bit of wish fulfillment for anyone who’d like a do-over. On those, it crosses the goal line.
Rated: 3/4

You can simply surrender yourself to the bland moral lessons of the movie, but even then, it’s hard not to feel like this was best left as a quirky human interest segment on a slow news day.

Erik Childress
Movie Madness Podcast
Apart from Mary Stuart Masterson getting some nice moments in the usual supportive wife role, the film never finds the kind of compelling emotional narrative of a film like The Rookie or any simple heartwarming
stinger at the end of a newscast.
Rated: 2/4

Jeffrey M. Anderson
Common Sense Media
It hits every familiar beat of the "inspiring sports drama" formula, and yet this drama doesn't feel artificial; it's heartfelt and genuine enough that it comes across as human.
Rated: 3/5

Michael Chiklis is fantastic as a man struggling with his demons....and how being on this team helps him come to terms with his past. This is a good, family friendly movie that you can see at theaters.

A solid family friendly inspirational sports movie with a good message, writing and acting. A great escape from the dark and cynical things that consume most entertainment now.

Great movie!
If I didn’t know that this was a true story, I would be saying this movie was unrealistic!
Go see it and put a smile, and some tears, on your face!
