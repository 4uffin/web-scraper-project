Critics Consensus
Half Nelson features powerful performances from Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps. It's a wise, unsentimental portrait of lonely people at the crossroads.

It's hardly a film which trumpets its virtues but that's part of the pleasure to be had from it. It doesn't know how good it is.

It's impressively adult, sure-footed filmmaking, and that Best Actor nod was definitely deserved.

Dunne [Gosling] is an enjoyable and impressive creation, justifiably recognised with an Oscar nomination for Gosling earlier this year.

Bleakly filmed and well told, "Half Nelson" soars because of the immaculate acting by Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps. Gosling's both alluring and pitiful as an addict, while Epps hits all the right notes as a child who's seen too much hardship.
Rated: 3/4

...the final scene is so lovely--so subtle, yet funny--that it makes up for any missteps that have come before it.

The more interesting aspects of the film come in its less pre-determined margins. And maybe the drama is highly strategised, but the acting is real and genuine.

A great indie tone with genuine & charming acting. A real look at messy lives in a grounded way without any big dramatic moments. The emotions are very subtle yet powerful while looking at addiction. But the overall message seems vague.

3.75. Is Gosling one of my favorite actors at this point? Guy has consistently delivered for years.

We've all seen a movie solely because an actor is in it...to me this movie is just that thing with Ryan Gosling

Half Nelson immediately sinks its way into your heart. It's mature and deep as it explores human weakness and the desire to do good. Gosling and Epps are a magical acting pair as they play each other's strengths with an older, struggling person trying to help and young, strong person. It's pure and sincere. The film ends openly, but the humanity it conveyed is a piece of indie film gold.

Yes the acting is great and there are some popular actors in this, but I found myself scrolling through my phone.
It wasn't what I expected. It was ok, but pretty boring.
