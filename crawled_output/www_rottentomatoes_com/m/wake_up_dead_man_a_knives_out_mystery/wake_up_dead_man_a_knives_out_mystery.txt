Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Giving Benoit Blanc a worthy mystery with its genuinely soulful fixation on faith and a scene-stealing Josh O'Connor performance, Wake Up Dead Man is another Knives Out puzzle that comes together splendidly.

It works, and it’s no big mystery why -- Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.
Rated: B+

The Ringer
The hype around O’Connor is real; his performance as a two-fisted holy man conveys a palpable sense of belief, enough to convert this perpetual Knives Out agnostic into a fan.

AARP Movies for Grownups
A cut above its 2022 predecessor, Glass Onion, the gothic plot, while darker, maintains its comic edge.
Rated: 4/5

The Beat
Johnson's third Knives Out mystery drowns in two-and-a-half hours of smug messaging and paper-thin characters, more an endurance test than a compelling whodunit

Looper.com
Wake Up Dead Man lives up to the standards of quality set by the past two films. In a few ways, it's even better.
Rated: 8.5/10

Perhaps Wake Up Dead Man 's greatest risk is also its greatest strength: Johnson's ambition to make a more complex work, more laden with symbolism, less weighty than its predecessors. [Full review in Spanish]
