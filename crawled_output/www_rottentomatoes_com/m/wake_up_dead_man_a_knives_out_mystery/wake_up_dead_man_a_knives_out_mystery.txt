Critics Consensus
Giving Benoit Blanc a worthy mystery with its genuinely soulful fixation on faith and a scene-stealing Josh O'Connor performance, Wake Up Dead Man is another Knives Out puzzle that comes together splendidly.

It works, and it’s no big mystery why -- Johnson knows his form and format, and delivers on it, playing with tone and message but never losing sight of why these stories are so damn entertaining to watch and unravel.
Rated: B+

The hype around O’Connor is real; his performance as a two-fisted holy man conveys a palpable sense of belief, enough to convert this perpetual Knives Out agnostic into a fan.

AARP Movies for Grownups
A cut above its 2022 predecessor, Glass Onion, the gothic plot, while darker, maintains its comic edge.
Rated: 4/5

This is the Knives Out mystery audiences have been waiting for. A fun, thrilling murder mystery that will keep you entertained until its very satisfying conclusion.
Rated: A

Muses of Media
Wake Up Dead Man will either be looked at fondly for its change of pace or will be dismissed for not replicating the novelty of the first film, which isn’t actually fair to it at all.
Rated: 4/5

But Why Tho? A Geek Community
Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery feels trapped in a liminal space between being memorable and forgettable.
