Brandon Yu
New York Times
All of You is a weepy, sweeping love story that knows full well that it’s trying to be one. But it never succumbs to cheap execution, and all of that comes down to Goldstein and Poots.

Kimberley Jones
Austin Chronicle
Goldstein, better known for his comic work and coming off a wincing dramatic arc on Shrinking, has limited range but nestles into his sweet spot here, a combination of smirking and sincere, and the underrated Poots is magnetic.
Rated: 2.5/5

Financial Times
...it feels raw, and real, and is resonantly acted. Your sympathies are torn, and stay that way. Such, maybe, is the nature of real love — a problem tech still can’t answer.
Rated: 4/5

Mark Reviews Movies
All of You poses a fascinating premise, ignores it, and only gives us the bare minimum of a potentially complex romance.
Rated: 2/4

Alise Chaffins
MacGuffin or Meaning (Substack)
The lack of real character development, the casting aside of the main conceit, and the stagnant story structure in the third act make All of You a wildly frustrating watch.
Rated: 2/5

Manuel São Bento
FandomWire
It's a film about the complexity of love that, ironically, feels too simple in its refusal to explore the moral consequences of its characters' choices, resulting in an experience that's more frustrating than moving.
Rated: C

Terrible. Romanticized infidelity with heavy drinking and drug use. Two immature and selfish people can't communicate or grow. Waste of 98 minutes.
