There are surface similarities to sci-fi romances like Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and Timer, but at its heart All Of You is more like a cross between two pre-dating-app classics: When Harry Met Sally and Brief Encounter.
Rated: B+

Unexpectedly touching and even lovely, a grandly sad benediction to people who don’t need no stinkin’ test to tell them who their soulmate is.

Both Goldstein and Poots share enough steamy chemistry to keep their characters’ flame for each other burning throughout the film.

Whatever its high concept, this is simply another tale of star-crossed lovers trapped in the messy unpredictability of life.

A soap opera, and a slightly frustrating one at that, but the writers try to generate a tortured existence for the main characters, and this intensity has its moments.
Rated: B-

Cool Girl Critiques
A tender and heartbreaking portrait of love with the right person at the wrong time — this drama’s cynical and cathartic take on the soulmate trope will leave an emotional mark by its final frame.
Rated: 3.5/5

Terrible. Romanticized infidelity with heavy drinking and drug use. Two immature and selfish people can't communicate or grow. Waste of 98 minutes.
