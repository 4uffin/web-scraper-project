What to Know
Critics Consensus
A classic farce with very modern relationship dynamics, Splitsville spreads the comedic wealth across its well-balanced ensemble.

Stephen Romei
The Australian
It takes some interesting ideas, such as monogamy versus open relationships, adds general coupledom anxieties, but fails to follow through on them in any meaningful way.
Rated: 2/5

But everything that happens in Splitsville is so remote from real human behaviour I couldn‚Äôt care less about any of these characters...
Rated: 1.5/5

Sergio Burstein
Los Angeles Times
This is a highly enjoyable work... it boasts that entertaining and eye-catching visual style that Covino had already employed in his debut film, confirming his talent for offering proposals of unquestionable cinematic value. [Full review in Spanish]

Loud and Clear Reviews
You‚Äôd think a love square would be a death sentence as the premise of a movie‚Ä¶ unless that movie was as wild, energized, and flat-out funny as Splitsville.
Rated: 4.5/5

Only some modest rewards in watching this uneven comedy about two scruffy mid-age guys navigating the assertive young women in their lives

This is one of the most underrated films of the year. Dakota, Adria, Michael and Kyle make an incredible unromantic comedy cast!
