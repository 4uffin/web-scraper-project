AARP Movies for Grownups
The movie is a labor of love about the never-ending emotional gut punch of parenthood and the individual’s need to find some beauty, clarity and connection in the wreckage of a well-intentioned family.

Strathairn lets you see what it costs him to do the right thing, even when that might make matters worse.

A movie about a family in deep disarray. But the writer-director, Angus MacLachlan, is not one to exploit turmoil. He understands that people in distress are deserving of our fullest understanding.
Rated: 4.5/5

The film gently invites you to be a fly on the wall – to really see and understand these people.

“A Little Prayer” is going to speak to people who come from cultures that are not expressive in the way that they communicate yet have a wellspring of emotion.
If you loved “Junebug,” do not expect lightning to strike twice since it is more muted

Pastoral grace... practically permeates the contained world of MacLachlan’s restrained but revelatory third feature.

"A Little Prayer" is the most realistic family drama that I've ever had the pleasure to see on screen. The characters are all very believeable and their stories are well-written and beautifully acted. Paw-Paw (the father), played by David Strathairn, and maw played by Jane Levy, are so relatable because you know them through family or friends (or maybe you are in a similar situation). I felt such empathy for the family struggles. My friend and I watched it together and enjoyed discussing our feelings about the film, characters and their decisions.
