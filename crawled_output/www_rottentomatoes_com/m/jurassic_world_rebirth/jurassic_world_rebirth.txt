Jurassic World Rebirth
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Going back to basics with rip-roaring set pieces and fossilized clichés, Jurassic World Rebirth doesn't evolve this prehistoric franchise but does restore some of its most reliable DNA.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Equal parts comforting and terrifying, returning to the beloved Jurassic World is a thrill, and while predictable, Rebirth jump-starts the franchise with a dino-mite time at the movies.

Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and Mahershala Ali have good chemistry.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
Gareth Edwards proves himself very capable, and he gets the very best of what is honestly a chunky script.

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
The film is so disinterested that it simply throws them onscreen with occasional bits of human beings stuck between their teeth. Rather than chew on disposable characters, those dinosaurs should have eaten their agents instead.
Rated: 2/4

Joe Lipsett
Queer.Horror.Movies.
Koepp’s structure has divided the film into two storylines that never quite mesh. While Rebirth does contain several stand-out set pieces, when everyone meets up in the finale, it becomes evident how unimportant any of the individual narratives are
Rated: 3.5/5

As B.B. King would put it, the thrill is gone.

The Blu Spot
Jurassic World: Rebirth may have a slightly improved, more straightforward plot when compared with the last entry, but sadly it doesn't do much to reinvigorate the franchise.
Rated: 2.5/5

Jurassic world is always an attractive series. However, there are not many dinosaurs shown in the movie. Also, I don’t get the conflict of interest between characters.

I love the experience we had at the theaters in Temecula. I felt like the movie could have been a little better.

It was better than what I thought it would be.
Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey, were good in this and good visual effects. I like the way it goes back to the original Jurassic Park movie. A few flaws in this film you can expect but, all in all, a must-see movie. Parts of the old set were nice to see, but I would have liked to have more story line involved with it. That's a flaw for me.
