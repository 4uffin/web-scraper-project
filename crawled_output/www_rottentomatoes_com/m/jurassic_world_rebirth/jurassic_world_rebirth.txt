Five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.

Jurassic World Rebirth
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Going back to basics with rip-roaring set pieces and fossilized clichés, Jurassic World Rebirth doesn't evolve this prehistoric franchise but does restore some of its most reliable DNA.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Equal parts comforting and terrifying, returning to the beloved Jurassic World is a thrill, and while predictable, Rebirth jump-starts the franchise with a dino-mite time at the movies.

Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey, and Mahershala Ali have good chemistry.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
Gareth Edwards proves himself very capable, and he gets the very best of what is honestly a chunky script.

Odie Henderson
Boston Globe
The film is so disinterested that it simply throws them onscreen with occasional bits of human beings stuck between their teeth. Rather than chew on disposable characters, those dinosaurs should have eaten their agents instead.
Rated: 2/4

Joe Lipsett
Queer.Horror.Movies.
Koepp’s structure has divided the film into two storylines that never quite mesh. While Rebirth does contain several stand-out set pieces, when everyone meets up in the finale, it becomes evident how unimportant any of the individual narratives are
Rated: 3.5/5

As B.B. King would put it, the thrill is gone.

The Blu Spot
Jurassic World: Rebirth may have a slightly improved, more straightforward plot when compared with the last entry, but sadly it doesn't do much to reinvigorate the franchise.
Rated: 2.5/5

Good but not great. I enjoyed the new dinos and love Scarlet Johansson!!
It has all the feels you are expecting from a Jurassic Park movie, the character relationships were a little underdeveloped. Movie felt a little rushed. But overall, I was glad I went to see it on the big screen.

The franchise is dead. After watching this film, I wasn't absolutely disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled either. The movie lacks the story it needs for the film and the set of acting alongside it. Though it does give some suspenseful moments in which is what the Jurassic Park/World series needed, the story didn't fit with what this film presented. The D-Rex was just another dinosaur like the Indominus Rex to revive what the Jurassic Park/World universe needed. The movie was made more for kids than anything else and that's what the series has headed to. They're just kid films now.

Jurassic world is always an attractive series. However, there are not many dinosaurs shown in the movie. Also, I don’t get the conflict of interest between characters.

I love the experience we had at the theaters in Temecula. I felt like the movie could have been a little better.
