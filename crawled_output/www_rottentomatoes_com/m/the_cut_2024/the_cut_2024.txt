Tim Robey
Daily Telegraph (UK)
What looks at first like a boxing drama tries to invent “weight-loss drama” as a genre all its own. The all-round exertion is immense, but the experience is a bizarre ordeal.
Rated: 2/5

While the film may not go about its expected narrative path, it never quite manages to make itself into anything interesting or edifying and winds up wasting an undeniably committed performance from Orlando Bloom in the process.
Rated: 2/4

The Spectator
It’s a story that’s been told umpteen times but what set this apart, I would suggest, is its deep and unremitting unpleasantness.

With a powerful, committed performance from Orlando Bloom and great ambition behind the camera, The Cut doesn’t land a knockout punch, but it does go the distance.
Rated: 2.5/4

Tom Cassidy
Common Sense Media
A cautionary tale of unprocessed trauma, the film lands a hard-hitting message about perspective: What success really means, and whether the price is worth it.
Rated: 3/5

One Guy's Opinion
More character study than boxing movie, 'The Boxer' represents a striking change of pace for Bloom, but it’s more impressive as an acting exercise than as a riveting drama.

Dr.J
Good performances, not your typical "Rocky" story.
More realistic as to the desires, means and consequences of being a fighter.
It was a bit too repetitive in making its point -- the length an aging boxer will go to in order to have his last hurrah -- and so it got a bit tedious.
Otherwise, interesting and reccomended.

The cut movie poster got me so hyped to watch the film. But after watching it, I was really disappointed. I thought it was about boxing, but it turned out to be about weight loss instead. Orlando Bloom’s performance is amazing, but overall, the movie didn’t meet my expectations.
