Director Ron Howard's Eden unravels the shocking true story of a group of disillusioned outsiders who abandon modern society in search of a new beginning. Settling on a remote, uninhabited island, their utopian dream quickly unravels as they discover that the greatest threat isn't the brutal climate or deadly wildlife, but each other. What follows is a chilling descent into chaos where tensions spiral, desperation takes hold, and a twisted power struggle leads to betrayal, violence, and the deaths of half the colony.

Eden
What to Know
Critics Consensus
A cohesive theme gets marooned in Eden's melodramatic dramatization of a colorful true story, but it does provide a starry cast and salacious thrills as compensation.

Observer
No character is developed seriously or deeply enough to reach more than the most superficial surface identity.
Rated: 1/4

Justin Chang
The New Yorker
Its title notwithstanding, “Eden” is a drama of paradise despoiled. The movie, to my eyes, badly miscalculates the ratio of paradise to despoilment, indulging the latter at the expense of the former.

Robert Abele
Los Angeles Times
Eden is probably closer to an expensive reality show about mismatched survivalists. But as August fare goes, it’s a sticky, sweaty hoot, well cast and paced like a disreputable beach read.

Spectrum Culture
Eden’s greatest sin is in painting its characters with broad strokes, resulting in conniving caricatures that engage in stilted arguments more than presenting lived-in personalities of survivalists believably stretched to their limits.
Rated: 2.5/5

Loud and Clear Reviews
Ron Howard takes that same stranger-than-fiction tale and transforms it into Eden, a psychological thriller that proves paradise has always been humanity’s most dangerous illusion.
Rated: 3/5

Black Catholic Messenger
Even the animals in the story are victims of savagery, pawns in a zero-sum game with deadly stakes. It’s “Lord of the Flies” meets “Jurassic Park”—and the exotic, grotesque predators are the humans.
Rated: A-

It's an okay movie, but really feels biased as to the one version of the story.
I got the impression that there was an obligation to tell the story a certain way out of respect of the family and also due to conditions of being allowed to use the book about the incident for the movie. That is was something that actually occurred is really fascinating but the movie makes most of the people in it very one dimensional while elevating other to being more clever. If this were an actual documentary it could've had the possibility of giving people more depth, but I understand that it was based on one perspective which isn't a medium that would allow anything but speculation on the motives of others there's no way to actually know what the others were thinking. But that also makes the film feel rather unbalanced.
All the same, I don't regret seeing it, it was history I didn't know about and it was very interesting to go home and look up what happened.

Its a true adventure story about something that really happened, which makes it even more difficult to reenact without going overboard. Ron Howard manages to do this,, as usual, presenting the viewer with a very fine movie that is enjoyable and keeps you on edge a little bit.

Really great watch. There movie starts and finishes strong, the characters are complex, and there are multiple memorable scenes. I wasnt a fan of Sydney Sweeney before, but she delivered during her performance and Ill now defend that shes a good actor. All of the actors were convincing. Lastly, I really enjoyed the dreadfully realistic tone to the movie that was amplified by the artistic shots of natural landscape and animals. The credits were the cherry on top (youll have to watch to see what I mean!)
