Critics Consensus
Cozy as an undemanding beach reach and just as slight, this starry murder mystery leverages its terrific troupe of actors to nostalgic effect.

There is some shock value, but the film goes too far in evading the truth; it nearly forgets to establish an emotional tether between the audience and its suspects.

Sometimes all you need is a nice, safe, and utterly pleasant piece of cinematic diversion that doesn’t insult your intelligence and is made with sturdy, workmanlike competence.

This is a cozy origin story of elderly sleuths who meet on Thursdays to solve cold cases until a hot one comes up. It's charming to see A-listers working together. If you like a comfortable British murder mystery, this is worth watching.

After a charming setup with such a lovely cast it is remarkable just how little they factor in to putting the final pieces together of the mystery which is substantially underwhelming.

Episodically overshadowed by a similarly formatted television show, investigating with inferior fun, slighter engagement and being titularly unfulfilled despite coasting on the good cast’s charms when they were having their own fun through few laughs amid an admirably polished screenplay I some areas. (B-)

How can a movie with such a great cast turn out so very boring and dull without the slightest highlight.

It’s boring and clearly inspired by Only Murders In The Building. Watch that instead.

A really fun, light murder mystery, with a cast full of familiar faces. The doers of various crimes are not obvious, but make sense when all is revealed. I suppose it’s not fine art, but it’s a fun, well-done film and gave us a great evening’s entertainment.
