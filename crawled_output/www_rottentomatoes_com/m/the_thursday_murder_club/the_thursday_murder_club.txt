Critics Consensus
Cozy as an undemanding beach reach and just as slight, this starry murder mystery leverages its terrific troupe of actors to nostalgic effect.

There is some shock value, but the film goes too far in evading the truth; it nearly forgets to establish an emotional tether between the audience and its suspects.

Sometimes all you need is a nice, safe, and utterly pleasant piece of cinematic diversion that doesn’t insult your intelligence and is made with sturdy, workmanlike competence.

Ultimately, it is Mirren, Brosnan, Kingsley and Imrie that make this adaptation work.

Daily Record (UK)
With Columbus and, bizarrely, Steven Spielberg - on producing duties - Osman’s work has attracted an unbelievable wealth of talent behind and in front of the camera.

This is a cozy origin story of elderly sleuths who meet on Thursdays to solve cold cases until a hot one comes up. It's charming to see A-listers working together. If you like a comfortable British murder mystery, this is worth watching.
Rated: 3/5

Great books series - god awful movie. Wanted to love it, ended up barely able to sit thru it. I hope they rewrite the script one day and give it another go, because there's so much potential in the source material.

Episodically overshadowed by a similarly formatted television show, investigating with inferior fun, slighter engagement and being titularly unfulfilled despite coasting on the good cast’s charms when they were having their own fun through few laughs amid an admirably polished screenplay I some areas. (B-)

How can a movie with such a great cast turn out so very boring and dull without the slightest highlight.

It’s boring and clearly inspired by Only Murders In The Building. Watch that instead.

A really fun, light murder mystery, with a cast full of familiar faces. The doers of various crimes are not obvious, but make sense when all is revealed. I suppose it’s not fine art, but it’s a fun, well-done film and gave us a great evening’s entertainment.
