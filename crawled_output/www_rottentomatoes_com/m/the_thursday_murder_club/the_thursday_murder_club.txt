Critics Consensus
Cozy as an undemanding beach reach and just as slight, this starry murder mystery leverages its terrific troupe of actors to nostalgic effect.

There is some shock value, but the film goes too far in evading the truth; it nearly forgets to establish an emotional tether between the audience and its suspects.

Sometimes all you need is a nice, safe, and utterly pleasant piece of cinematic diversion that doesn’t insult your intelligence and is made with sturdy, workmanlike competence.

This is a cozy origin story of elderly sleuths who meet on Thursdays to solve cold cases until a hot one comes up. It's charming to see A-listers working together. If you like a comfortable British murder mystery, this is worth watching.

After a charming setup with such a lovely cast it is remarkable just how little they factor in to putting the final pieces together of the mystery which is substantially underwhelming.

A really fun, light murder mystery, with a cast full of familiar faces. The doers of various crimes are not obvious, but make sense when all is revealed. I suppose it’s not fine art, but it’s a fun, well-done film and gave us a great evening’s entertainment.

Trite nonsense. Quite an achievement to take such a talented cast to create such banality.

I get why the ratings are low for this - it started off SUPER slow zzz. But guys, it's Helen Mirren++!! And there's plot twists at the end that make me glad I stuck with it. By the end it turns into about a 78% Rotten Tomatoes level movie, so I gave it 4 stars. Have to stick with it!

A profound disappointment. A retirement home reimagined an an annex of Downton Abbey. A cast not assembled in deference to a well written entertaining book, but a box tickiing exercise for an international streaming audience. It's horribly contrived and deviates pointlessly . Pierce Brosman is hopelessly miscast as Ron, Ben Kingsley fares little better. It's all rather inept and cringe inducing. Avoid. Read the book
