Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe-nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation's railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award-nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality and newfound meaning for the forests and trees he has felled.

A dirge so solemn, viewers may exit this train before it arrives at its destination.
Rated: 2.5/4

The New Yorker
The result invites obvious yet not inapt comparisons to the work of Terrence Malick, but Bentley’s film unfolds in a more dramatically direct, compacted register.

Financial Times
Bearing echoes of Kelly Reichardt’s 2019 film First Cow, Train Dreams taps into the rough-hewn pioneer poetry of individualism and brutality in a vast wilderness.

ScreenAnarchy
The slow cinema experience on offer with Train Dreams is well worth the trip -- if only because the plot of the film, and the antagonist as well, revolves around the passage of time. ... Elegiac experience in the dark. And also in life.

Solzy at the Movies
[I]ts power lies in elevating one man’s ordinary path into something epic, a reflection of the American Dream and the harsh, breathtaking landscapes of the Pacific Northwest.
Rated: 4.5/5

Cup of Soul
Joel Edgerton holds the movie together. His performance is quietly powerful, as he maintains his strength in the face of pressure, undergoes transformation due to loss, and finds solace in fleeting moments of kindness and reminiscence.
Rated: 7.5/10
