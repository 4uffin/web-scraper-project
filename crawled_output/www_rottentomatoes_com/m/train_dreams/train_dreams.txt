Based on the beloved novella by Denis Johnson, Train Dreams is the moving portrait of Robert Grainier (Golden Globe-nominee Joel Edgerton), whose life unfolds during an era of unprecedented change in early 20th century America. Orphaned at a young age, Robert grows into adulthood among the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest, where he helps expand the nation's railroad empire alongside men as unforgettable as the landscapes they inhabit. After a tender courtship, he marries Gladys (Academy Award-nominee Felicity Jones) and they build a home together, though his work often takes him far from her and their young daughter. When his life takes an unexpected turn, Robert finds beauty, brutality and newfound meaning for the forests and trees he has felled.

A dirge so solemn, viewers may exit this train before it arrives at its destination.
Rated: 2.5/4

The New Yorker
The result invites obvious yet not inapt comparisons to the work of Terrence Malick, but Bentley’s film unfolds in a more dramatically direct, compacted register.

Financial Times
Bearing echoes of Kelly Reichardt’s 2019 film First Cow, Train Dreams taps into the rough-hewn pioneer poetry of individualism and brutality in a vast wilderness.

Train Dreams is a miraculous wonder. The kind of movie that forces you to stop and take stock of this planet.

The Jam Report
An achingly beautiful piece of Americana, tender in its humanity and devastating in its recognition that life rarely grants second chances.
Rated: 4.5/5

Through very simple, mundane moments, Train Dreams portrays an encyclopedic understanding of life. A song sang next to a fire, an encounter with a fugitive, a sleepy afternoon by a meadow.
Rated: A-
