Glenn Kenny
New York Times
While Thompson’s characterization begins with strong notes of Frances McDormand’s Marge Gunderson in the classic thriller “Fargo,” the actress, as she always does, comes into her own and creates a rich rooting interest.

San Jose Mercury News
Dead of Winter is intense but its plot holes are hard too overlook. A shame given how some elements and the cast are so strong.
Rated: 2.5/4

Clarisse Loughrey
Independent (UK)
I can’t imagine this signals the start of a career change for Thompson, but it’s a refreshing little detour for one of Britain’s national treasures.
Rated: 3/5

“Dead of Winter” is suspenseful but mostly unpleasant and implausible.
Rated: 2/5

Killer Movie Reviews
There is much to admire about Emma Thompson here, not the least of which is the way she captures the cadence and the spirit of the Minnesota accent with the same effortless skill that embodies the rest of her performance.
Rated: 4/5

Aisle Seat
This year, a new category will be added to the Oscars honoring the best achievement in casting. I think they should give it to whoever came up with the idea to cast Judy Greer as a villain in this movie.
Rated: 3/4
