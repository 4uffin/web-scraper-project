David Ehrlich
IndieWire
Hardly a scene goes by where Thompson isn’t beaten, chased, and/or shot at in sub-zero temperatures, but you get the sense that all of the frostbite in the world couldn’t have stopped her from getting her own little taste of “Fargo.”
Rated: B-

Jessica Kiang
Variety
These are plot holes big and deep enough to drop a lure into and hook a fat trout. Yet sidestep them and “The Dead of Winter” entertains, largely due to Thompson’s sturdy portrait of grace clad in a sensible, fleece-lined overcoat of gumption.

Guardian
Thompson’s relatable presence and likability-aura make a very good solvent for the concentrated nastiness of Greer’s desperate villain and what she has in mind for her teen prisoner. There’s a distinct chill.
Rated: 5/5

This is a welcome movie for older women, showing how a 60-year-old widow can take on some bad people all by herself. Filled with high tension throughout, I found it exhausting, captivating, and believable.
Rated: 8/10

Chris Wasser
Sunday Independent (Ireland)
Written by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, Dead of Winter starts well, and I believe Thompson still deserves her very own Taken moment. Problems occur, however, when this patchy and preposterous actioner tries to explain itself.
Rated: 2/5

The Film Yap
Emma Thompson is probably the last actress you'd expect to see in a tense action/thriller, as a widow facing off with a diabolical couple. Of course, she nails it.
Rated: 4/5
