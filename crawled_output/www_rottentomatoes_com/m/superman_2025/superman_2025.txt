Critics Consensus
Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this Superman flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.

An entertaining reboot. A quirky, humanizing and socially conscious interpretation of a classic story retold for this generation.

[A] puckish and political (but wildly overstuffed) blockbuster.

Simply Cinema (Substack)
Not since Christopher Reeve has Superman been portrayed with such humanity and heart and Corenswet is as worthy a successor as the character’s legacy could hope for.
Rated: 9/10

The Blu Spot
James Gunn's Superman is a surprisingly mixed start for his new DC universe, one that has a lot of positive elements, but which also needed improvement in other areas.
Rated: 3/5

Mac the Movie Guy
While definitely entertaining and worth the wait, there’s no doubt that Superman had room to explore a better version of itself. One possibly without all the typical fanboy gags James Gunn has become known for.
Rated: 80/100

From the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, comes another great funny super hero movie with an emotional charge and beautiful cgi, James Gunn is setting up the stage for a great DC comeback or so I hope.

A phenomenal movie from the second it starts to the very end of the credits. Brilliantly written, love the characterization and I'm so glad to watch a superhero movie that matches the vibe of main hero it's portraying instead of going for the big broody mindset simply because it's what most superhero movies have done for the past decade. I'd watch this in theaters every day just to support the entire cast, crew and production team for this movie, if I had the funds to!

Shockingly bad movie. I went into it with high hopes only to have them dashed from the first scene. Who wants to watch two hours of Superman getting his butt kicked?
