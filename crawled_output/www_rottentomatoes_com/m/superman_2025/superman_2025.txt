Pulling off the heroic feat of fleshing out a dynamic new world while putting its champion's big, beating heart front and center, this Superman flies high as a Man of Tomorrow grounded in the here and now.

An entertaining reboot. A quirky, humanizing and socially conscious interpretation of a classic story retold for this generation.

[A] puckish and political (but wildly overstuffed) blockbuster.

Jeff Beck
The Blu Spot
James Gunn's Superman is a surprisingly mixed start for his new DC universe, one that has a lot of positive elements, but which also needed improvement in other areas.
Rated: 3/5

Mac the Movie Guy
While definitely entertaining and worth the wait, there’s no doubt that Superman had room to explore a better version of itself. One possibly without all the typical fanboy gags James Gunn has become known for.
Rated: 80/100

Rincón de cine
It's an entertaining film that may leave those of us who grew up with Superman nostalgic, but for new generations, it gives a taste of one of the most iconic superheroes of yesteryear, the Man of Steel.
Rated: 2.5/5

Shockingly bad movie. I went into it with high hopes only to have them dashed from the first scene. Who wants to watch two hours of Superman getting his butt kicked?

I love Superman but was extremely disappointed in the movie.
I would prefer more relationship
stories with Superman. It was just mainly fighting over and over again.
The best part of the movie was the dog Krypto, and he was AI.
I left the theatre very disappointed.
