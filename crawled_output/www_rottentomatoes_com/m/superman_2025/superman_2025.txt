An entertaining reboot. A quirky, humanizing and socially conscious interpretation of a classic story retold for this generation.

[A] puckish and political (but wildly overstuffed) blockbuster.

It's an entertaining film that may leave those of us who grew up with Superman nostalgic, but for new generations, it gives a taste of one of the most iconic superheroes of yesteryear, the Man of Steel.
Rated: 2.5/5

Tait's Take (YouTube)
Definitely worth seeing. It’s definitely worth seeing in the theaters and it’s definitely worth seeing on the biggest screen possible. It’s far from perfect. But i think its a love letter to Superman fans and i think its a love letter to comic book fans.
Rated: 3.5/5

Free Press Journal (India)
This film may be overstuffed at times, but it’s brimming with heart and ideas. Unlike previous iterations, this edition is steeped in a sci-fi setting that’s modern and hyper-connected, reflecting a world shaped by surveillance, social media...
Rated: 3.5/5

With there being a pattern the past few years of not so great superhero films, it’s refreshing to see one that actually beat a lot of my expectations.
