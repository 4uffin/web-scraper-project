Written and directed by Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland (Civil War, 28 Days Later), Warfare embeds audiences with a platoon of American Navy SEALs on a surveillance mission gone wrong in insurgent territory. A visceral, boots-on-the-ground story of modern warfare and brotherhood, told like never before: in real time and based on the memory of the people who lived it.

Warfare
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Narratively cut to the bone and geared up with superb filmmaking craft, Warfare evokes the primal terror of combat with unnerving power.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
Warfare viscerally places you in the trenches with bone-crunching realism, honoring the soldier experience while simultaneously philosophizing on the impossibility of their sacrifice.

Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
I say this as a compliment and not as a criticism, I wanted it to end.

Wendy Ide
Observer (UK)
Warfare, by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, is the most forceful and unflinching depiction of combat since Edward Berger’s 2023 Oscar-winning All Quiet on the Western Front. It’s also one of the boldest and most formally daring.
Rated: 5/5

Jake Wilson
Sydney Morning Herald
While conventional entertainment value may not be the film’s strength, Garland and Mendoza have taken some impressive risks in throwing many of the rules of drama out the window.
Rated: 3/5

Henry Wong
Esquire UK
A torn-off limb, misplaced weapons, unrecognisable bodies. It is the closest to frontline action many of us are likely to get. Thank god, but the glimpse is electrifying.

Butler's Cinema Scene
It’s about as accurate a look at modern combat as we’re likely to see.
Rated: B

Mac the Movie Guy
Warfare is something to be felt, heard, and experienced, and while the variant on war may not have toppled the genre, the freshness and perspective was overdue.
Rated: 83/100

raw, well made, well acted ... but it ends a bit abruptly that left me a little bit like... that's it? It's worth a once over for sure. But, I probably won't revisit it. I love war esq./military films, too.

Went into this with no context whatsoever, so I was surprised that this was just a moment from a man’s actual experience when he was serving in the army. The way this was directed made you feel anxious and scared because you don’t know what’s gonna happen next. This was quite the film, not many war films like this, so this is a standout among the rest.
