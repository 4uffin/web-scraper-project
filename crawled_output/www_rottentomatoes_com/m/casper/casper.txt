When specialist James Harvey (Bill Pullman) arrives to communicate with Casper and his fellow spirits, he brings along his teenage daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci). Casper quickly falls in love with Kat, but their budding relationship is complicated not only by his transparent state, but also by his troublemaking apparition uncles and their mischievous antics.

It's a funny and often poignant film that's worth reexamining today.

t's aimed squarely at the tinies, but there is charm enough here to make it bearable for adults too.

Going cartoony not only keeps Casper and crew looking like their comic-book counterparts, it also keeps what passes for menace in this movie on the gentler side.

Casper is a deeply tragic yet oddly wholesome coming-of-age tale about loneliness and grief. Though the film is essentially a meditation on death, it isn’t all doom and gloom. It still has its zany moments and mid-90s charm.
Rated: 3/5

More like a Cinderella story than a gothic horror, this really was one of the most under-rated movies of the 1990s and should keep viewers of all ages engrossed on a slow summer holiday day.

Ugggh I'd like to give it a 4 but the more I think about it, the more I see the problems it has. I liked it though and had a lot of fun. Acting isn't bad. Riccii & Casper are great and the two best things that are consistently good the entire time. I can see why Casper became so iconic. He's likable, charming, and excellently animated. Impressed with how Christina always made me feel like he was actually there. Pullman was good until the final third and just kinda goes off the rails in a drunken stooper. Not sure how else to describe it. The villians are ok I guess but are more cartoonish than anything. The three ghost brothers are...alright I guess but I wish they just got rid of them kind of. They don't serve much purpose besides comedic relief and being annoying. No real personality amongst them individually. The music & cinematography is great. The special effects are good overall. Sometimes they look incredible still like Casper and the other ghosts. But other times like the human ghosts at the end are a bit shotty. Practical effects are awesome too. Some CGI every once in a while looks weird. The house looks awesome and is very memorable with really good set design and imagination. Some scenes though get weighed down by the slapstick or are so goofy and over the top like Superman III level at some points. Pretty much any scene with her Dad falls into this. It feels like someone mixed Tim Burton, Spielberg, and Columbus together. It has a very family movie type of charm to it that anyone can watch despite the darker themes explored. Editing isn't bad though I mean it makes perfect sense but it has a tone problem and jumps between the Dad joking around with the three ghosts and Ricci & Casper. It feels like sometimes it doesn't know what to do with her Dad and it's them just doing dumb gags that are way too slap sticky and pointless. If it just focused on Casper & Riccii this would be signifcantly more consistent. It would also help if the humor was...funny or more zany. It's just very dumb childrens cartoon feeling. This also can't decide if it wants to be super comedic or super sappy and pulls on the heart strings in the end that doesn't feel entirely justified. It needed to be more serious and tone down the humor, figure out what to do with Pullman more, get rid of the three brother ghosts, and have better villians. The cameos also are kind of out of place and pointless but not really a big deal. It's got good pacing despite that. Because even when it falters it never stops throwing something at you to make up for the dumb jokes. Effects, music, the house, Casper & Ricci, it all still has a charm to it somehow that I could'nt escape. And it helped me overlook a lot of the flaws. Anyone who is a fan of any actors here, the director, or is looking for a fun haunted house movie that won't scare kids should take a shot at this. I liked it quite a bit despite the flaws.

Casper has problematic elements and some jokes and themes are offensive, but it’s emotional weight, cartoonish humor, dazzling visuals and importance of friendship makes it up for its flaws.

What this movie needs is new character designs. Those are the things that scare me. Other than that, this movie is just okay. Nothing more, nothing less

After 30 years this remains a huge part of my childhood growing up I find it odd some call it bad but it’s a harmless family movie A box office success that spawned several direct-to-video follow ups even a new cartoon series Executive producer Steven Speilberg and director Brad Siberling bring the iconic child specter from the 1940s cartoon to the silver screen in live action Starring Christina Ricci, Bill Pullman, Cathy Moriarty, and Billy Idol Casper is just a child ghost who only wants a friend but he’s at a disadvantage since humans scream and run away at the sight of him and his uncles Stretch, Stinky, and Fatso They also mistreat him frequently A greedy woman named Carrigan and her assistant Dibs are after a so-called treasure hidden in her late uncle’s house, Whipstaff Manor In comes Dr. James Harvey who specializes in communicating with the spirits of the deceased, people who have unfinished business before passing onto the afterlife He always travels across the country with his daughter Kat who isn’t fond of his methods plus the fact her mother died and thinks her father is determined to find her ghost too They both move into the mansion with Carrigan counting on them to get rid of the ghosts but Kat and Dr. Harvey end up befriending the mischievous spirits with Casper even creating a special bond with Kat Together they form a powerful friendship while also discovering Casper’s life before he died There’s still a lot to appreciate here; the special effects are kinda fun, the sets are really creative, and you can tell the filmmakers were trying to put actual effort into it A very touching score by the late James Horner adds some interesting emotional depth There’s also some hilarious cameo actors sprinkled throughout If you’re not opposed to ghostly puns then you’ll still have a good time It’s not awful but could’ve been worse considering the subject matter as it deals with death, loss, coping, letting go, loneliness, grief, and coming to terms with life after death not being all bad A coming of age tale blending family and supernatural having mid 90s charm while also having some winsome philosophy It doesn’t hurt it has weighty dramatic fare, funny and poignancy, and it’s not reliant on being too scary for kids with the menace being more gentle Casper is quite lovable with Ricci being one of the most adorable child actresses of the generation Even new audiences today are thankfully discovering the movie’s charm as well as nostalgic value Again this was one of my childhood favorites, I couldn’t believe how amazing the special effects were in the 90s but this movie also provides a lot of emotion and heart It’s another Speilberg classic to be remembered
