Like the original, The Toxic Avenger isn't for everyone -- but viewers seeking an extremely gory, extremely silly good time won't be disappointed.

AARP Movies for Grownups
This enthusiastic revival of the 1984 original ups the tech values and adds a recognizable cast without sacrificing the original’s ick factor... No learning, no hugs, just schlock and awe.

Ultimately, this is a fan-made effort for fans, though we're sure it will be appreciated in different ways by fans. [Full review in Spanish]

Whether poking at superhero cliches (there’s a choice post-credit scene) or trying to be kill-clever, it’s all in dopey, gruesome fun.

The Times of India
This grotesque, over-the-top reboot blends absurd gore, dark humour, and surprising emotional depth to deliver a chaotic yet oddly heartfelt cult revival.
Rated: 3.5/5

Everything that needs to be there is there to pay tribute to the original - it's funny, it's violent and Peter Dinklage is great. What the film lacks though is a decent storyline though so some may be disappointed.
Rated: 3.5/5

Fun from the start to the finish with a Stella cast to boot. I love a movie that understands exactly what it is and has nothing to prove other than having fun within the confines of the world its created. Plus who doesn't love a guy who falls in toxic goo and becomes a hero?!?!

If you remember the original Toxic Avenger fondly, then you definitely need to see this remake.
If you’ve never seen any Troma films before, then just know that this film is very gory, irreverent, silly, and not meant to be taken seriously. If you’re good with all of that, then you’ll have a great time!

Bastian
A fun, gory, and at at points even earnest alternative to the wildly over-saturated Superhero movie market, the hero as much a monster as he is a champion and having a real emotional stake in righting wrongs.
Awful people die horribly and hilariously throughout, the film really having its finger on the political pulse of 21st Century America, the phone call to the health insurance company eliciting audible sympathetic groans from the audience.

I remember the original in all its cheesy B-movie glory. A fun and ridiculous retelling.

funny af. don't want to spoil anything but if you're more than a few minutes into it and think the tone is weird, realize that it's a satire and is parodying superhero movies. I'm a huge toxie fan, and while this wasn't that, I loved it as an alternate version of that universe. can't wait to see it again and definitely buying it if it's put out physically.
