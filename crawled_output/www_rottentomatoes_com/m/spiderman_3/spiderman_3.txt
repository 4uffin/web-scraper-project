Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) seem to finally be on the right track in their complicated relationship, but trouble looms for the superhero and his lover. Peter's Spider-Man suit turns black and takes control of him, not only giving Peter enhanced power but also bringing out the dark side of his personality. Peter must overcome the suit's influence as two supervillains, Sandman and Venom, rise up to destroy him and all those he holds dear.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Though there are more characters and plotlines, and the action sequences still dazzle, Spider-Man 3 nonetheless isn't quite as refined as the first two.

David Stratton
At the Movies (Australia)
Spider-Man 3 is the longest film in the series so far, and perhaps it tries to pack in rather too much. But it's intelligently directed by Sam Raimi and, with all those eye-popping set pieces, it's certainly never boring.
Rated: 3.5/5

New Statesman
The breeziness that was so refreshing in the other episodes has been largely replaced by the kind of misery and moping that we can get from any old superhero.

Roger Ebert
Chicago Sun-Times
Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting "oooh!" this way, then swiveling and shouting "aaah!" that way.
Rated: 2/4

On a technical level, the production was never better. There were multiple cutting-edge special effects sequences and techniques used here...
Rated: 6/10

What could have been if the studio didn't stick its inky black nose in Raimi's business...

Gone With The Twins
Raimi, perhaps pressured by the fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into this third - and presumably last - chapter of this hugely popular property.
Rated: 7/10

Uncle R.
An underrated movie. It sucks that Sony forced Sam Raimi to put Venom in it, if you take Venom out the movie would be a masterpiece.

I really enjoy watching Spider-Man 3 all the action between venom, Sandman and new goblin. Peter deal with his new personality under the black symbiote suit what's interesting. showing the darkest side of Peter that nobody ever seen before. I like that it had to return of Tobey Maguire Kristen Dunst James Franco Rosemary Harris & J.K. simmons. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were perfect choice to play Sandman and Venom. Byrce Dallas Howard were amazing with her role as Gwen Stacy. Its terrible this movie received bad reviews from critcs , the director Sam rami and Tobey Maguire saying its was worst flim to the franchise. I give this film of B-
