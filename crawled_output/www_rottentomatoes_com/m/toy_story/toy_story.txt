Globe and Mail
There's a giddy, absurd charm to the story, in which the strange setting only enhances the comfortable familiarity of the narrative and characters.

Kevin McManus
Washington Post
The simple story is enlivened by the distinctive personalities of the toys, especially the irascible tater head, the supportive Bo Peep lamp (voiced by Annie Potts) and a neurotic plastic dinosaur

Toronto Star
More fun than Christmas mornings and birthday presents and winning a prize and making a friend, more fun than parking for free and falling in love and flying to Paris, more fun than anything you can think of is Toy Story.
Rated: 5/5

Me gusta el cine
It may have been the first production of its kind, but the beauty of “Toy Story” lies in its characters, the themes it explores, and, of course, how funny it is. [Full review in Spanish].

It’s a story that still holds up because themes of identity, friendship, and lifestyle changes are a constant presence in all our lives, no matter how old we get or where we come from.

Tulsa World
The result is a clash of toy cultures and values -- nostalgic, old-fashioned simplicity versus visionary, space-age ingenuity.
