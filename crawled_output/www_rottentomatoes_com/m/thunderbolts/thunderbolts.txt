Thunderbolts is a film of undeniable merit that stands out among the abundance of similar offerings released in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]

Bloomberg News
To my shock, Thunderbolts* is the best thing Marvel has put out in ages -- a well-acted piece of popcorn entertainment that balances zippy humor with actual depth. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Will it restore your faith in the franchise? Maybe yes.

The Nightly (AU)
Thunderbolts is a taut thriller sprinkled with wry humour and packs grounded emotional resonance. The latter is a surprise for a film that’s sold as a romp, which it still is, but it is as focused on its characters as it is on explosions
Rated: 3.5/5

Everything is Horrible (Substack)
The stale jokes and tired fight scenes would be bad enough. The endless shoveling of amnesiac inspiration, though, pushes the film past tedious and on into actually offensive.

Matthew Huff
Parade Magazine
Thunderbolts* succeeds because for the first time since Black Panther, it is an MCU movie with something to say. In a world of screens and politics where isolation is growing stronger, a
superhero movie focusing on mental health is a welcome revelation.
Rated: B+

It is dark in a way that feels uniquely relevant, tackling issues such as grief and trauma in a relatable, thoughtful way.

Danny P
This movie is underappreciated. The performances were outstanding by every single actor. They convincingly embodied the comic book soul of characters they portrayed.
Was it perfect? No.
There are definitely a few plot points that are problematic.
But overall it was a fantastic experience.

Gabriel G.
it was an average marvel movie. it had lots of potential to be something profoundly moving, with it's focus on mental health and trauma. But, it chose to be an easy to consume piece of reject pop culture.
