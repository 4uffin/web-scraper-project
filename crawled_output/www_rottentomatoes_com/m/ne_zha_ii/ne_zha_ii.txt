Ne Zha II
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Visually spectacular with a hyperactive sense of humor, Ne Zha II is a sequel that supercharges the original's charms while still being accessible for the uninitiated.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
A truly all-encompassing sequel best served alongside its predecessor, Ne Zha 2 is a technical and narrative triumph that exceeds expectations and further immortalizes the Chinese legend.

CBC Radio
Dozens of characters come through, give you a minute-long monologue about their complicated backstory, and then go to battle. It can be exhausting. But the animation, and the world building, can be really spectacular.

Boston Globe
Since the animation looked stunning, I went in with intense curiosity. I emerged 145 minutes later confused and nursing one of the worst headaches I’ve had in decades.
Rated: 2/4

The Hollywood Reporter
Adults, at least those not addicted to this sort of mythological fantasy, will have a harder time. Nonetheless, there’s plenty to appreciate, especially the massively scaled, spectacular visuals that demand to be seen on the largest screen possible.

Impulse Gamer
Overall, Ne Zha 2 delivers an astounding visual and emotional blockbuster experience that eclipses the original with flying colours, powerful action scenes, memorable characters, and well-realised drama. Highly recommended.
Rated: 5/5

Goes BIG on spectacle, less so on comprehension - wickedly funny little chaos gremlin protagonist keeps getting lost amid his own movie's compulsion toward video game fireworks (all of which look great, but less so when one isn't holding the controller.)
Rated: 6/10

Ne Zha 2 is the closest thing to The Lord of the Rings since Return of the King in its sprawling magnitude and immensity.

Extremely satisfied with the action, animation, dub voice acting, direction, story and comedy. I had second doubts i would like this movie after seeing the first movie but that was not the case and I really enjoyed this one.

if you liked Ne Zha
then Ne Zha II
is 5.
Not many people were at the showing we attended.
We couldn't obviously use fandango reward money to book this movie - we had trouble finding showings of this movie. I would definitely try and see any Ne Zha III.
It was a bit slow in places.
We enjoyed hearing Michelle Yeoh in the english dubbing
