Vengeance
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Writer-director-star B.J. Novak could have taken a sharper approach to this dark comedy's deeper themes, but if you're in the mood for a slyly smart mystery, Vengeance is yours.

Mark Kermode
Kermode and Mayo's Take (YouTube)
The film has quite a hard time negotiating between the serious and the comedy... you don't need to see it on the big screen.

It’s mildly amusing stuff that delivers no surprises, but may muster a few laughs.
Rated: 3/5

Novak imbues the yokels with dignity and unfussy sophistication.

Samantha Schuster
Cinéfilo Serial
A fine debut by actor, director, and screenwriter B.J. Novak, who manages to deliver a film of suspense, humor, and reflection on our society and the essence of human beings. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 3.5/5

Brittany Patrice Witherspoon
Pop Culture Reviews
Though the script ventures into the unrealistic with its over-the-top Texas spirit and overused philosophical messages embedded throughout, Vengeance gets one important thing right. It finds a way to compel viewers emotionally...
Rated: 4/5

Even with a flawed story and some underdeveloped characters, Vengeance shines through a hilarious script and a colorful bunch of Shaws that protagonist Ben interacts with.

The previews did zero for me and I was not planning on watching it. We were planning to go another show and we couldnt make the time. We ended up watching this movie. Literally one of the best movies Ive ever seen. The movie really pulls you in and you can absolutely see the change of character that he makes. During the movie. Over the top awesome. Again one of the best movies Ive ever seen.

I liked it a lot. It is billed as a comedy/mystery so I expected more comedy. It started with a look at
the dating scene in NYC, but ended as a commentary on a small town with a big opioid problem and the associated characters involved. I thought it was well done. All of the actors were really spot on and a surprising conclusion!
Go, you’ll like it!

A hilarious dark comedy with philosophical undertones. Characters are well cast as a Texas dysfunctional family who welcomes a New York boyfriend. My husband I both loved this film.
