Hank Thompson (Austin Butler) was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl (Zoë Kravitz), tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ (Matt Smith) asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters. They all want a piece of him; the problem is he has no idea why. As Hank attempts to evade their ever-tightening grip, he's got to use all his hustle to stay alive long enough to find out....

What to Know
Critics Consensus
A freewheeling throwback, Caught Stealing splendidly showcases Austin Butler's movie star charisma while marking a surprisingly lighthearted gearshift for director Darren Aronofsky.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
A diverting, pulpy caper with ‘90s flair, Caught Stealing is a gritty, violent ride fueled by the charisma of Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz.

Boston Globe
Aronofsky doesn’t respect his characters. He doesn’t disrespect them as much as he disrespected Brendan Fraser’s title character in “The Whale,” but a friend to the human condition he is not. He also doesn’t respect the audience.
Rated: 2/4

It was darker than I had anticipated from the trailers but still more fun than other Aronofsky films, and there’s a cat in it.

This is a straightforward, entertaining crime thriller.

Simply Cinema (Substack)
Big action sequences. Big stars. Big humor. By no means does Caught Stealing break new ground or blaze to the upper echelons of its genre — but it’s a damn good time at the movies.
Rated: 7/10

Leandro Ariel Porcelli
Cinéfilo Serial
A thriller with an amazing cast that offers high-octane entertainment thanks to some great action, good comedy and a good share of both surprises and suspense. Huston and Aronofsky use their experience to make it easy to enjoy. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

Dan Friedman
Book & Film Globe
Hank, played here with blue eyes, impeccable abs and small-town charisma by Austin Butler, mostly stumbles through the film like a man who desperately wants a nap but instead keeps waking up in the ER or someone else’s crime scene.
Rated: 4/5

While I love that Aronofsky has waded into fun’ish escapist thriller fare, I expected more from him. It’s a quite a lightweight story and straddles the fence between violent action and cartoonish slapstick but never commits to either. No mather how many gun battles and OTT fight scenes that populate the picture, it’s a bit of a snoozer until the Hasidic hitmen get involved. And there is some nostalgic fun for anyone who’s lived in or spent much time in NYC’s East Village/LES.
