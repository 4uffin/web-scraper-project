Hank Thompson (Austin Butler) was a high-school baseball phenom who can't play anymore, but everything else is going okay. He's got a great girl (Zoë Kravitz), tends bar at a New York dive, and his favorite team is making an underdog run at the pennant. When his punk-rock neighbor Russ (Matt Smith) asks him to take care of his cat for a few days, Hank suddenly finds himself caught in the middle of a motley crew of threatening gangsters. They all want a piece of him; the problem is he has no idea why. As Hank attempts to evade their ever-tightening grip, he's got to use all his hustle to stay alive long enough to find out....

What to Know
Critics Consensus
A freewheeling throwback, Caught Stealing splendidly showcases Austin Butler's movie star charisma while marking a surprisingly lighthearted gearshift for director Darren Aronofsky.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
A diverting, pulpy caper with ‘90s flair, Caught Stealing is a gritty, violent ride fueled by the charisma of Austin Butler and Zoë Kravitz.

It was darker than I had anticipated from the trailers but still more fun than other Aronofsky films, and there’s a cat in it.

AARP Movies for Grownups
Caught Stealing is the best movie from Darren Aronofsky... in years, a crazy After Hours-style yarn with a high body count and a buoyant, breathless pace.
Rated: 4/5

Leandro Ariel Porcelli
Cinéfilo Serial
A thriller with an amazing cast that offers high-octane entertainment thanks to some great action, good comedy and a good share of both surprises and suspense. Huston and Aronofsky use their experience to make it easy to enjoy. [Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 8/10

Dan Friedman
Book & Film Globe
Hank, played here with blue eyes, impeccable abs and small-town charisma by Austin Butler, mostly stumbles through the film like a man who desperately wants a nap but instead keeps waking up in the ER or someone else’s crime scene.
Rated: 4/5

Film Ireland Magazine
The action suffers from being too slick to be gritty and too uneven to be truly funny. Still, the playful plot, strong performances and immersive sense of place are enough to enjoy.

If you're in the mood for a crazy, entertaining action movie this is it. And if you've got an artsy side I recommend staying through the credits.

I had no idea what to expect going in as the trailer reminded me to much of “Baby Driver”, but once the second act kicked in, I was so invested and had accepted this film to be a popcorn flick mixed with real emotions as Darren pours some real haunting grief into the arc of Austin’s character which pays off in a euphoric way. I will say that as much fun as I had watching this film, and as satisfying as the ending was. It’s not a must see theatrical experience, it does come off as a streaming movie. But it delivers on being a thrill ride

Jeffey G!
Great cast.
Loved all the Lower East Side locations. A little excessively gory for a non-slasher film. Watched through my fingers a bit. What happened to Aronofsky to make a movie like this?? But glad Charlie Huston finally go a movie of his great books.

A great movie with an eye catching opening. The story is solid, logical, with believable characters that have relatable flaws.
You will not regret seeing this movie.
