Rebel Ridge
What to Know
Critics Consensus
An intelligent and gripping vehicle for Aaron Pierre's star-making performance, Rebel Ridge lays down the law on its action-thriller contemporaries.

Ty Burr
Ty Burr's Watch List (Substack)
“Rebel Ridge” isn’t up there with Saulnier’s earlier films but it’s still something rare in the commercial movie landscape: A work of pure professionalism behind the camera and in front of it.
Rated: 3/5

Adam Nayman
The Ringer
With a whip-smart plot, a strong lead in Aaron Pierre, and a standout villain in Don Johnson, director Jeremy Saulnier has done it again.

Jeremy Saulnier’s Rebel Ridge starts with a frantic pace that grips the viewer, but unfortunately in its second half it loses too much momentum and becomes so conventional that, within a few days, it is already forgotten. [Full Review in Spanish]
Rated: 3/5

Sammie Purcell
Rough Draft Atlanta
“Rebel Ridge” is a crafty, complex, and rigidly intense thriller, ripe with the stink of systemic rot and the desperate measures that rot creates.

The Reader (Omaha, NE)
Saulnier lets the slow burn sizzle, opting for an understated climax that keeps the whole thing on the right-side of almost realistic.

Just watched Rebel Ridge and I gotta say, solid 3.5 stars from me. I only hit play because it was recommended and Aaron Pierre’s in it—since he’s gonna be Green Lantern soon, I was curious. Honestly, dude carries this movie. He’s got that intensity and quiet strength that makes you go, yeah, this guy can be John Stewart. Also, super pleasant surprise seeing AnnaSophia Robb pop up—she was one of my childhood crushes, so that was a little bonus.
The movie nails the “hate the cops from the jump” vibe and really leans into the injustice theme. It’s not the action-packed Netflix thrill ride they sold it as—it’s way more drama-thriller—but the drama is so raw and believable it works. The acting across the board is excellent, and the impact is heavy. Only real knock? The pacing’s a bit rough, could’ve used tighter editing. Still, if they make a sequel, I’m in.

Only three times have I watched a movie and wished someone had paid me for the time I wasted watching it. Rebel Ridge (2024) is one of those films.
I could tell the actors were trying their best with the material they were given; however, the script and direction are missing any genuine human element. It ultimately lacks soul.

Don Johnson’s terrific performance is failed by a goofy, unbelievable plot that reeks of political correctness.
Do yourself a favor & watch First Blood.
Its much more entertaining & satisfying. Stallone got it right.
