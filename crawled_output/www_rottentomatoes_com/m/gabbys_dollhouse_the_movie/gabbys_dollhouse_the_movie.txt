Sydney Morning Herald
I can understand the film’s appeal for young children...But if you’re over 10, its relentlessly upbeat tone makes you feel as if you’re being beaten over the head with a toy catalogue.
Rated: 2/5

San Francisco Chronicle
Songs and jokes and a surprisingly psychedelic sensibility make for a safe, kooky and sometimes even adult-amusing good time.
Rated: 3/4

A genial throwaway that skitters through incidents with a G-rated innocuousness that makes it perfect for a very pint-sized demo.

This film adaptation of Gabby's Dollhouse is ideal for fans of the series and children in general...The only negative aspect is that the sheer amount of overstimulation...may be exhausting for adult audiences...[Full review in Spanish]
Rated: 6/10

Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie is like rotten and tangled cotton candy. This sloppy movie spinoff of the Netflix TV series tries to look vibrant and appealing, but it's an incoherent mess with terrible acting and a cluttered plot about a lost dollhouse.

The result is a cute, thoughtful film that allows a new generation of kids to contemplate what it means to grow up.

Cavalier S.
A great fun filled ride for the whole family. Not only do you get music from the show but you also get top notch songs from the full length feature as well. The story is perfect for all ages as it shows you it’s okay to still have imagination.
