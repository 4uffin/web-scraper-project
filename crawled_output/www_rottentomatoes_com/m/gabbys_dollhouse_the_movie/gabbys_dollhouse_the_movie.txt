Sydney Morning Herald
I can understand the film’s appeal for young children...But if you’re over 10, its relentlessly upbeat tone makes you feel as if you’re being beaten over the head with a toy catalogue.
Rated: 2/5

San Francisco Chronicle
Songs and jokes and a surprisingly psychedelic sensibility make for a safe, kooky and sometimes even adult-amusing good time.
Rated: 3/4

Variety
A genial throwaway that skitters through incidents with a G-rated innocuousness that makes it perfect for a very pint-sized demo.

Gabby’s Dollhouse: The Movie is like rotten and tangled cotton candy. This sloppy movie spinoff of the Netflix TV series tries to look vibrant and appealing, but it's an incoherent mess with terrible acting and a cluttered plot about a lost dollhouse.

Screen Rant
The result is a cute, thoughtful film that allows a new generation of kids to contemplate what it means to grow up.
Rated: 6/10

Common Sense Media
The movie ultimately succeeds as a spirited, inventive, and participation-driven romp for kids—if perhaps one best enjoyed in moderation.
