Critics Consensus
Gargantuan in action, runtime, and scope, The Final Reckoning is a sentimental sendoff for Ethan Hunt that accomplishes its mission with a characteristic flair for the impossible.

The film entertains, moves, keeps its hero on the right path, and has at least one memorable sequence that gives you goosebumps because it looks so realistic. [Full review in Spanish]

Predictably, this new movie is overblown, inanely plotted, clotted with expository dialogue and boundlessly self-congratulatory. But, you know, it's also fun to watch.

If this is the end, what a way to go. An impossible mission that’s made possible and thrilling by a brilliant cast, crew and a movie star extraordinaire.
Rated: 3.5/4

The Final Reckoning adds a valedictory air to all the tense conversations and dazzling mayhem, making sure we know that not only is the fate of the world at stake, but also the fate of the franchise.
Rated: 4/5

Mac the Movie Guy
Somehow the reliable team that has kept Mission: Impossible so venerable for so long stumbles a bit at the finish line. But the mission is possible, and Cruise and McQuarrie keep the franchise from self-destructing in 5, 4, 3, 2…
Rated: 74/100

Sure, Final Reckoning isn’t the best of the franchise, but even a modest winner is still a winner. And overall, these films ultimately netted far, far more joy and thrills than disappointment.

This final (?) franchise is actually full of action, crazy stunts, and cool locations which is classic Tom Cruise doing what he does best. The story isn’t super strong and sometimes feels a bit cheesy or over-explained, but it still keeps you watching. To be honest, It’s too long and some parts feel like a tribute to past Mission: Impossible films, with old characters and flashbacks. And the ending? It wasn’t perfect and didn’t really feel like the true “final” movie, yet it leaves room for more. Even with a few flaws, it’s fun, exciting, and worth seeing, especially on IMAX like I did.

I absolutely LOVE this movie. It was a great last movie with small references to the previous ones. And it definitely lives up to its title.
