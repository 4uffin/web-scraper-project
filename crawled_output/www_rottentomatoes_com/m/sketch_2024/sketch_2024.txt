When a young girl's sketchbook falls into a strange pond, her drawings come to life--unpredictable, chaotic, and dangerously real. As the town unravels, she and her brother must track down the creatures before they leave permanent damage. Their father, racing to find them through the fallout, must navigate a town in crisis to reunite his family and stop the disaster they never meant to unleash.

Ben Kenigsberg
New York Times
While the children are permitted a measure of psychology, the older characters, especially Amber and Jack’s mopey, klutzy father (overplayed by Tony Hale), are treated as earnest mouthpieces for the story’s morals.

Kimberley Jones
Austin Chronicle
Worley is just as invested in the emotional nuance of the story, which meets each of its grieving characters at their own speed and shows them a lot of grace.
Rated: 3.5/5

No matter its title, it’s a full-bodied triumph bursting with humor, tenderness, and imagination.

First-time writer/director Seth Worley studiously keeps matters on the safe side of frightening, thanks to superb, studio-grade animation and themes about odd-kid syndrome and parental loss, which he deftly renders with humour and humanity. A real gem.
Rated: 3/5

Nobody's Reading This But Me
The technicolour monsters are a visionary blast, but the pain of loss they represent is all too real.
Rated: 3.5/5

Q Network Film Desk
the kind of film you might have seen in the mid-1980s prefaced with an Amblin logo and an “executive produced by Steven Spielberg” credit
Rated: 3.5/4

Definitely great for kids to young teenagers. I would have loved this movie if it was released in the early 2000’s. Maybe not the best for teens to adults but I would still say it’s worth a watch for how original and well done the movie it.

It was a better movie than I expected. I liked that it shows children that they could cope with grief in different ways.

Great movie!
Well acted and easy to follow with deep emotional undertones but also funny and light at times.
My kids loved the creatures and drawings and were engaged the whole time!
Two thumbs up!
