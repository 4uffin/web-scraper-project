New York Times
What gives the documentary an added edge is that the director implicates himself in the proceedings.

The Reveal
Apart from anything else, Predators is a clinic in documentary ethics, but Osit’s intellect doesn’t mute his pain, sensitivity and outrage. It’s a film for the heart and the head.
Rated: 4.5/5

Liz Shannon Miller
Consequence
The core question Predators aims to explore isn't the motivations of the original men who were caught in Hansen's trap — it's why the show was fascinating viewing for so many people.
Rated: B

The Contending
Predators is thought-provoking and upsetting in all the ways you don’t expect it to be.

Next Best Picture
Stirring and provocative, it is not only one of the year’s most fascinating documentaries but also a career highlight for Dave Osit.
Rated: 8/10

Mark Reviews Movies
The film raises ... many ... questions about the show ["To Catch a Predator"], its legacy, its assorted copycats, and, finally, its host.
Rated: 3/4
